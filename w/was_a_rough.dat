25|$|Two irreconcilable hungers {{triggered}} the First Anglo-Burmese War of 1824: Burma's desire for more territory, and Britain's desire for more trade. Burma threatened Assam and Bengal; Britain responded by attacking and absorbing two Burmese provinces into her India holdings to broaden her trade routes to East Asia. The war <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rough</b> interruption of the Baptists' missionary work. English-speaking Americans were too easily {{confused with the}} enemy and suspected of spying.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} First Church stood {{close to}} the former beach in the city's lower High Street.

It was opened in September 1848, within {{six months of the}} arrival of the city's first permanent European settlers from Scotland. So hasty was the construction of the building that early congregations had to remain standing, as seating was not installed until three months later.|$|E

25|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rough</b> {{dispute between}} President Băsescu and Premier Ponta on fuel price rise by 7 cents, measure adopted since 1 April 2014. The {{head of state}} asked Victor Ponta to waive the fee he deems an {{unnecessary}} and discriminatory tax burden. Likewise, Traian Băsescu {{is convinced that the}} measure will lead to tax evasion. The measure was also criticized by opposition. Thus, on 15 March, between 8,000 and 10,000 people, members or supporters of the People's Movement Party, protested in Bucharest's George Enescu Square against Ponta's poor economic policies and wave of taxes that will be introduced once with 1 April. Romania figures among the countries with the most expensive gasoline in the world, at $7.38 per gallon (€1.41 per litre).|$|E
25|$|Melbourne in {{the early}} 1850s <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rough</b> and {{primitive}} place with potholed roads. Robbery was commonplace, and the poverty caused by the soaring inflation, and streets that were in 1854 described as open sewers ensured that disease was rife. It was into this environment came men seeking fortunes digging for gold. Within ten years the gold rush had transformed Melbourne from a provincial outpost of the British Empire to a wealthy and rapidly expanding city. Between 1853 and 1854 Melbourne doubled in size, however many of its new and expanding population lived in tented villages within the city. This need for building coupled with available funding drew aspiring young architects from around the world, among them John James Clark, Peter Kerr and in William Wilkinson Wardell.|$|E
25|$|The Ducks {{began their}} Cup {{defense against the}} Los Angeles Kings for a two-game set in London, England, without Niedermayer and Selanne (who were still pondering retirement) and an injured Pahlsson and Giguere, {{splitting}} the series. Highly touted prospect Bobby Ryan scored his first career NHL goal during the series. However, Ryan played only 23 games with the big club during the season, primarily playing in the AHL. On October 10, against the Boston Bruins, the Ducks raised their Pacific Division, Western Conference and Stanley Cup championship banners. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rough</b> start overall for the Ducks, however, as they made minor trades to try and stay alive in the West. Burke said he would eventually let goaltender Ilya Bryzgalov go because he felt he deserved to have a starting position in the NHL. Burke ultimately made good on his promise and placed Bryzgalov on waivers, where he {{was picked up by}} the Phoenix Coyotes.|$|E

25|$|George's {{first job}} {{was as a}} butcher's boy. A bareknuckle prizefighter, he later became an {{apprentice}} to Ben White of 'May Tree Cottage', Kensal New Town, a dealer of Old English Bulldogs, the ancestral breed of Bulldog used for dog fighting. Kensal New Town <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rough</b> working class area with many Irish immigrants and the scene of Protestant-Catholic conflicts. He was indirectly part of an incident in 1825, sponsored by Sam Wedgbury, who had bought a dog from White, and a menagerie owner called George Wombwell, involving lion-baiting by Bulldogs. George {{is said to have}} unsuccessfully attempted to dissuade the participants from continuing in this bloody enterprise. The outcome was that one of the lions was injured and several dogs were killed, leading to public outrage and a local ordinance banning the use of dogs for fighting. The practice continued in secret, however, and White's kennels remained in operation, with George continuing to work for him.|$|E
25|$|The {{nearby town}} of Coulson {{appeared}} a far more likely site. Coulson <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rough</b> and tumble town where arguments were often followed by gunplay. Liver-Eating Johnston was a lawman in Coulson. Perhaps the most famous person {{to be buried in}} Coulsons Boothill cemetery is Muggins Taylor, the scout who carried the news of Custer's Last Stand to the world. Most buried here were said to have died with their boots on. The town of Coulson had been situated on the Yellowstone River, which made it ideal for the commerce that steamboats brought up the river. However, when the Montana & Minnesota Land Company oversaw the development of potential railroad land, they ignored Coulson, and platted the new town of Billings just a couple of miles to the Northwest. Coulson quickly faded away; most of her residents were absorbed into Billings. Yet for a short time the two towns co-existed: a trolley even ran between the two. But ultimately there was no future for Coulson as Billings grew. Though it stood {{on the banks of the}} Yellowstone River only a couple of miles from the heart of present-day Downtown Billings, the city of Billings never built on the land where Coulson once stood. Today Coulson Park sits along the banks of the Yellowstone where the valley's first town once stood.|$|E
25|$|In 1806, much of Calabria <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rough</b> place. The 1783 Calabrian {{earthquakes}} {{had killed}} 100,000 persons. Much of Reggio {{was still in}} ruins as late as 1813 and many churches were not been rebuilt by 1806. The Calabrians were a hardy breed with an independent streak. They sometimes indulged in vendettas against neighboring families and villages. Plundering Imperial troops and grasping French civil authorities quickly set off a rebellion by the proud Calabrians. On the other hand, {{the residents of the}} major towns despised the Neapolitan royal government and often favored the French. The revolt flared up after certain incidents. At Scigliano the French left a detachment of 50 soldiers. A woman was raped and the villagers massacred most of the Frenchmen. The French commanders had only one response to such events, to assault, sack, and burn down the offending village. This led directly to an ugly cycle of atrocity and counter-atrocity. The newly anointed King Joseph tried to be fair. He ordered French soldiers to be shot for criminal offenses and French officials to be put on trial for corruption. Nevertheless, the Calabrian insurrection soon ran out of control. The Siege of Gaeta would occupy the French from 26 February to 18 July. Meanwhile, the Battle of Maida on 4 July would seriously threaten French control of Calabria.|$|E

[...] Colburn and a crew of boatwrights came in the rear, to repair bateaux as needed. [...] Morgan's group traveled relatively lightly, as they would be working to make the trail, while the last group, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Enos, carried {{the bulk of the}} supplies. [...] The expedition arrived at its first target, Fort Halifax, a decaying relic of the French and Indian War, on the second day. [...] There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rough</b> track from Fort Western, so some of the men and supplies had moved overland rather than in the bateaux that had to be portaged around the falls above Fort Western to begin the trip.

500|$|Pal (June 4, 1940– June 1958) <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>Rough</b> Collie {{performer}} {{and the first}} in a line of such dogs to portray the fictional female collie Lassie in film and television. Pal was born in California in 1940 and eventually brought to the notice of Rudd Weatherwax, a Hollywood animal trainer. In 1943, the dog was chosen to play Lassie in MGM's feature film, Lassie Come Home. Following his film debut, Pal starred in six more MGM Lassie films from the mid-1940s to early 1950s, then appeared briefly in shows, fairs, and rodeos around the United States before starring in the two pilots filmed in 1954 for the television series, Lassie. Pal retired after filming the television pilots, and died in June 1958. [...] He sired a line of descendants who continued to play the fictional character he originated. In 1992, The Saturday Evening Post said Pal had [...] "the most spectacular canine career in film history".|$|E

500|$|Wau {{is a town}} in New Guinea, in the {{province}} of Morobe situated {{at one end of the}} Wau-Bulolo Valley. It was the site of a gold rush during the 1920s and 1930s. Gold prospectors arrived at the coast at Salamaua and struggled inland along the Black Cat Track. The miners partially cleared the area and built houses and workshops, and established a water supply and an electricity grid. They constructed the aerodromes at Wau and Bulolo which were the primary means of reaching the Wau-Bulolo Valley. Wau aerodrome <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rough</b> Kunai grass airstrip [...] in length with a 10 per cent slope heading directly for Mount Kaindi. Aircraft could approach from the north east only, landing uphill and taking off downhill. The mountain at the end of the runway prevented second attempts at landing and precluded extension of the strip. Pilots had to manoeuvre Dakotas under clouds and through dangerous passes, [...] "dodging a peak here and cloud there", landing at high speeds. This required good visibility, but the weather over Owen Stanley Range was characterised by frequent storms, vertical drafts, and mists which rose from the jungle floor. The first landing at Wau was made by Ernest Mustard in his De Havilland DH.37 on 19 April 1927. Osmar White, who reached Wau in June 1942, wrote: ...|$|E
500|$|When the {{original}} television series was cancelled in 1969, Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry lobbied Paramount Pictures {{to continue the}} franchise through a feature film. The success of the series in syndication convinced the studio to begin work on the film beginning in 1975. A series of writers attempted to craft a [...] "suitably epic" [...] script, but the attempts did not satisfy Paramount, so the studio scrapped the project in 1977. Paramount instead planned on returning the franchise to its roots, with a new television series titled [...] The box office success of Close Encounters of the Third Kind, however, convinced Paramount that science fiction films other than Star Wars could do well at the box office, so the studio cancelled production of Phase II and resumed its attempts at making a Star Trek film. In 1978, Paramount assembled the largest press conference held at the studio since the 1950s, to announce that two-time Academy Award–winning director Robert Wise would direct a $15 million budget film adaptation of {{the original}} television series. With the cancellation of Phase II, writers rushed to adapt its planned pilot episode, [...] "In Thy Image", into a film script. Constant revisions to the story and the shooting script continued {{to the extent of}} hourly script updates on shooting dates. The Enterprise was modified inside and out; costume designer Robert Fletcher provided new uniforms, and production designer Harold Michelson fabricated new sets. Jerry Goldsmith composed the film's score, beginning an association with Star Trek that would continue until 2002. When the original contractors for the optical effects proved unable to complete their tasks in time, effects supervisor Douglas Trumbull was given carte blanche to meet the film's December 1979 release date. The film came together only days before the premiere; Wise took the just-completed film to its Washington, D.C., opening, but always felt that the final theatrical version <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rough</b> cut of the film that he had wanted to make.|$|E
500|$|Dwyane Wade {{was born}} on the South Side of Chicago, Illinois, to JoLinda and Dwyane Wade Sr, whose name's unusual {{spelling}} was decided by his own mother. In 1977, JoLinda, {{at the age of}} 18, already had two children. Wade has described his upbringing in Chicago as being very difficult. Wade stated that [...] " [...] mom was on drugs and [...] family was in the gang environment, so it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rough</b> childhood." [...] At a very young age, Wade already witnessed police raids and found dead bodies several times in a nearby garbage can. When he was only 4 months old, his parents separated – and would later divorce. Jolinda was given custody of the two children, and she moved to her mother's house with them. The family struggled financially, and it was around that time when Jolinda started dealing drugs. His mom was addicted to several substances including cigarettes, alcohol, heroin, and cocaine. JoLinda would get high with friends at her home, even in the presence of her children. In an interview with ESPN, Wade said [...] "I've seen the needles laying around the house. I've seen my mother shoot up before. I've seen a lot of things my mother didn't even know I'd seen as a kid." [...] At the age of 6, he recalls police – with guns drawn – raiding his home as they searched for his mother. When Wade turned 8 years old, his older sister, Tragil, tricked him – by telling him they were going to the movies – into living with his father, a former Army sergeant, and stepmother in a nearby neighborhood. Wade would still occasionally visit his mom. A year later, his father moved the family to Robbins, Illinois. After moving to Robbins, Wade didn't see his mother for two years. During this time, JoLinda was able to access a free supply of drugs by volunteering to be a tester – i.e., someone who tests street drugs for impurities before the dealers try to sell them. JoLinda was hospitalized and nearly died after she mistakenly injected herself with LSD. In 1994, JoLinda was arrested for possession of crack cocaine with intent to sell and locked up in Cook County Jail. Wade, at the age of 10, reunited with his mom by talking with her at Cook County Jail through a glass panel over a telephone. JoLinda served 23 months in prison for her crimes, but while serving her second sentence in 1997, she failed to report to prison while on work release.|$|E
