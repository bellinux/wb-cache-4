40|$|ABSTRACT: Soy {{protein and}} {{carbohydrate}} at different ratios were blended with latex to form composites. The variation of protein-to-carbohydrate ratio {{has a significant}} effect on the composite properties, and the results from dynamic mechanical method showed a substantial reinforcement effect. The composites reinforced by the filler <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> protein content had higher moduli than the composites <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> carbohydrate content. Soy carbohydrate also appeared to have ability to immobilize polymer chains compared to soy protein. The fatigue experiments showed that the composites <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> protein content were more elastic than the composites <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> carbohydrate content after repeatedly stressed with dynamic strain cycles. The recovery experiments showed that the moduli of the composites <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> protein content had better long-time recovery after deformation. The analysis of equilibrated residual structure after the stress-softening cycles showed that the composites <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> protein content were resilient without yielding until a larger strain was applied, while the composites <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> carbohydrate content had a continuous yielding in their structures as the magnitude of the strain was increased. Overall, the study shows that soy fillers <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> protein/carbohydrate ratio have potential to be used as rubber reinforcement...|$|R
