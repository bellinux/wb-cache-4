50|$|The urban {{legend of}} the Pittsburgh Refrigerator Cats {{periodically}} resurfaced in the twentieth century. The Greenfield Daily Report (January 21, 1929) printed a contributor’s reminiscence regarding the local carpenter having an odd-looking kittens. It was a <b>white</b> <b>long-hair,</b> but {{did not look like}} a Persian. The correspondent described it as looking more like a polar bear’s cub. The carpenter claimed it was a Cold Storage Cat. The account was attributed to Mara Evens in the Saturday Evening Post, adding that after several generations roaming the neighbourhood, the descendants of the Cold Storage cats reverted to shorthairs. This would have been the case if long-hair cats bred with short-haired cats, because the gene for long-hair is recessive.|$|E
