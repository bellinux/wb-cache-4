40|$|Background: The {{treatment}} algorithm for sacral fracture associated with vertical shear pelvic fracture has not emerged. Our {{aim was to}} study a new approach of fixation for comminuted and vertically unstable fracture pattern with spinopelvic dissociation to overcome inconsistent outcome and avoid complications associated with fixations. We propose fixation with well-contoured thick reconstruction plate spreading across sacrum from one iliac bone to another with fixation points in iliac wing, sacral ala and sacral pedicle on either side. Present biomechanical study tests the four fixation pattern to compare their stiffness to vertical compressive forces. Materials and Methods: Dissection was performed on human cadavers through posterior midline paraspinal approach elevating erector spinae from insertion with two flaps. Feasibility of surgical exposure and placement of contoured plate for fixation was evaluated. Ten age and sex matched computed tomography scans of pelvis with both hips were obtained. Reconstructions were performed with advantage windows 4. 2 (GE Light Speed QX/I, General Electric, Milwaukee, WI, USA). Using the annotation tools, direct digital CT measurement (0. 6 mm increments) of three linear parameters was carried out. Readings were recorded at S 2 sacral level. Pelvic CT scans were extensively studied for entry point, trajectory and estimated length for screw placement in S 2 pedicle, sacral ala and iliac wing. Readings were recorded for desired angulation of screw in iliac wing ala of sacrum and sacral pedicle with respect to midline. The readings were analyzed by the values of mean and standard deviation. Biomechanical efficacy of fixation methods was studied separately on synthetic bone. Four fixation patterns given below were tested to compare their stiffness to vertical compressive forces: 1) Single S 1 iliosacral screw (7. 5 mm cancellous screw), 2) Two S 1 and S 2 iliosacral screws, 3) Isolated trans-iliosacral plate, 4) Trans-iliosacral plate + single S 1 iliosacral screw. Statistical Analysis: Mean of desired angulation for inserting screws and percentage of displacement on biomechanical testing was evaluated. Results: Mean angulations for inserting sacral pedicel were 12. 3 ΀ (SD 2. 7 ΀) convergent to midline and divergent of 14 ΀ (SD 2. 3 ΀) for sacral ala screw and 23 ΀ (SD 4. 9 ΀) for iliac <b>wing</b> <b>screw.</b> All screws needed to be inserted at an angle of 90 ΀ to sacral dorsum to avoid violation of root canals. Cross headed displacement across fracture site was measured and plotted against the applied vertical shear load of 300 N in five cycles each for all the four configurations. Also, the force required for cross headed displacement of 2. 5 mm and 5 mm was recorded for all configurations. Transmitted load across both ischial tuberosities was measured to resolve unequal distribution of forces. Taking one screw construct (configuration 1) as standard base reference, trans-iliosacral plate construct (configuration 3) showed equal rigidity to standard reference. Two screw construct (configuration 2) was 12 % stronger and trans-iliosacral plate (configuration 4) with screw was 9 % stronger at 2. 5 mm displacing on 300 N force, while it showed 30 % and 6 %, respectively, at 5 mm cross-headed displacement. Conclusions: Trans-iliosacral plating is feasible anatomically, biomechanically and radiologically for sacral fractures associated with vertical shear pelvic fractures. Low profile of plate {{reduces the risk of}} hardware prominence and decreases the need for implant removal. Also, the fixation pattern of plate allows to spare mobile lumbosacral junction which is an important segment for spinal mobility. Biomechanical studies revealed that rigidity offered by plate for cross headed displacement across fracture site is equal to sacroiliac screws and further rigidity of construct can be increased with addition of one more screw. There is need for precountered thicker plate in future...|$|E

50|$|The glider was {{constructed}} predominantly from wood {{with a single}} spar built from laminated wood supporting wooden built up ribs covered with a relatively thick plywood skin, {{which resulted in a}} smooth surface with minimal distortion.The wing had three distinct sections, comprising a constant-chord, unswept centre section flanked by swept tapered outer sections. Primary flight controls consisted of elevons on the trailing edges of the outer wing sections for pitch and roll, with fins and rudders on the wing-tips for yaw stability and control. Trim in pitch was achieved by adjusting the incidence of movable <b>wing</b> tips using <b>screw</b> jacks. For approach and landing split flaps were fitted to the wing centre section trailing edge.|$|R
60|$|It {{was then}} he saw the American aeroplane. He saw it {{in the light of the}} flash as a thing {{altogether}} motionless. Even its screw appeared still, and its men were rigid dolls. (For it was so near he could see the men upon it quite distinctly.) Its stern was tilting down, and the whole machine was heeling over. It was of the Colt-Coburn-Langley pattern, with double up-tilted <b>wings</b> and the <b>screw</b> ahead, and the men were in a boat-like body netted over. From this very light long body, magazine guns projected on either side. One thing that was strikingly odd and wonderful in that moment of revelation was that the left upper wing was burning downward with a reddish, smoky flame. But this was not the most wonderful thing about this apparition. The most wonderful thing was that it and a German airship five hundred yards below were threaded as it were on the lightning flash, which turned out of its path as if to take them, and, that out from the corners and projecting points of its huge wings everywhere, little branching thorn-trees of lightning were streaming.|$|R
