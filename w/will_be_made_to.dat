5|$|The Judd School sixth form {{can be said}} to {{have been}} {{established}} as early as 1903in the wake of the Education Act of 1902when the Pupil Teachers Scheme was born and The Judd School was used a training centre for young teachers. However, normal pupils above the age of 16 were not permitted until 1919; previously special permission from the governors was required to stay on beyond this age. A 1952 government inspection stated that 42 students were in the sixth form. Judd's sixth form has significantly grown over the last decade, consisting of 308 students at the last Ofsted inspection in 2007. A minimum of 40 offers per year <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> external applicants; girls are admitted in Year Twelve (aged 16) and make up about 16 percent of the sixth form. The sixth form has its own Common Room in the main school building, including a dedicated cafeteria and study area.|$|E

25|$|Since the 1950s, {{a number}} of writers and social {{commentators}} have speculated in some depth about {{the social and cultural}} changes that might result from the advent of commercially affordable additive manufacturing technology. Amongst the more notable ideas to have emerged from these inquiries has been the suggestion that, as more and more 3D printers start to enter people's homes, the conventional relationship between the home and the workplace might get further eroded. Likewise, it has also been suggested that, as it becomes easier for businesses to transmit designs for new objects around the globe, so the need for high-speed freight services might also become less. Finally, given the ease with which certain objects can now be replicated, {{it remains to be seen}} whether changes <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> current copyright legislation so as to protect intellectual property rights with the new technology widely available.|$|E
25|$|The {{township}} has {{two large}} divisions, Milton and Lake Hopatcong. Each half {{has its own}} first-aid squad, fire department substation and set of elementary schools. Addresses in the Milton section of the township are classified under the Oak Ridge mailing city, which is shared with a portion of West Milford Township, or in the Newfoundland mailing area, shared with a portion of West Milford and Rockaway Township. Addresses in Lake Hopatcong use either Lake Hopatcong (not {{to be confused with}} the Hopatcong mailing city used in the Borough of Hopatcong) or Wharton as their mailing city. In 2016, there was an effort to change the mailing address for the Lake Shawnee section of town from a Wharton, NJ 07885 ZIP code, to a Lake Hopatcong, NJ 07849 ZIP code. The effort was narrowly defeated. In 2026, a new effort <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> change the mailing address ZIP code to Lake Hopatcong, NJ 07849. The Jefferson Township Municipal Building, Middle School, High School, Recycling Center and school bus depot are positioned at the boundary between the two halves of the township.|$|E
500|$|Tanaka's force {{departed}} the Shortlands {{just after}} midnight on November 30 for the run to Guadalcanal. [...] Tanaka attempted to evade Allied aerial reconnaissance aircraft by first heading northeast through Bougainville Strait before turning southeast and then south to pass through Indispensable Strait. [...] Paul Mason, an Australian coastwatcher stationed in southern Bougainville, reported by radio the departure of Tanaka's ships from Shortland and this message was passed to Wright. [...] At the same time, a Japanese search aircraft spotted an Allied convoy near Guadalcanal and communicated the sighting to Tanaka who told his destroyer commanders to expect action that night and that, [...] "In such an event, utmost efforts <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> destroy the enemy without regard for the unloading of supplies." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the wake}} of the coup, Simović's new {{government}} refused to ratify Yugoslavia's signing of the Tripartite Pact, but did not openly rule it out. Hitler, angered by the coup and anti-German incidents in Belgrade, gathered his senior officers and ordered that Yugoslavia be crushed without delay. On the same day as the coup he issued Führer Directive 25 which called for Yugoslavia to be treated as a hostile state. Italy was {{to be included in the}} operations and the directive made specific mention that [...] "fforts <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> induce Hungary and Bulgaria to take part in operations by offering them the prospect of regaining Banat and Macedonia". Furthermore, the directive stated that [...] "nternal tensions in Yugoslavia will be encouraged by giving political assurances to the Croats".|$|E
500|$|The {{party were}} further slowed {{down by the}} {{frostbite}} in Oates' left foot - daily marches were now down to less than five miles, which was insufficient {{given the lack of}} oil. Furthermore, by March 10 it became evident the dog teams were not coming: [...] "The dogs which would have been our salvation have evidently failed. Meares [...] had a bad trip home I suppose." [...] In a farewell letter to Sir Edgar Speyer, dated March 16, Scott wondered whether he had overshot the meeting point and fought the growing suspicion that he had in fact been abandoned by the dog teams: [...] "We very nearly came through, and it's a pity to have missed it, but lately I have felt that we have overshot our mark. No-one is to blame and I hope no attempt <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> suggest that we had lacked support." [...] On the same day, Oates, who [...] "now with hands as well as feet pretty well useless", voluntarily left the tent and walked to his death. Scott wrote that Oates' last words were [...] "I am just going outside and may be some time".|$|E
500|$|Opinion {{about the}} value of Florida to the Union was mixed: some thought it a useless land of swamps and horrible animals, while others thought it a gift from God for {{national}} prosperity. In 1838 comments in The Army and Navy Chronicle supported future development of southern Florida: [...] climate [...] most delightful; but, from want of actual observation, [...] could not speak so confidently of the soil, although, from the appearance of the surrounding vegetation, a portion of it, at least, must be rich. Whenever the aborigines shall be forced from their fastnesses, as eventually they must be, the enterprising spirit of our countrymen will very soon discover the sections best adapted to cultivation, and the now barren or unproductive everglades <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> blossom like a garden. It is the general impression that these everglades are uninhabitable during the summer months, by reason of their being overflowed by the abundant rains of the season; but if it should prove that these inundations are caused or increased by obstructions to the natural courses of the rivers, as outlets to the numerous lakes, American industry will remove these obstructions.|$|E

500|$|The {{decision}} {{had to be}} made to either exclusively fund the GCV or ECPs, so upgrades were chosen for the Bradley, Abrams, Stryker, and M109 Paladin fleets to have them more combat-capable in the near-term, should they be needed for an international situation. [...] Vehicles like the Bradley and Abrams have been upgraded since the 1980s with new armor, sensors, and other gear that have maxed out the platforms for further horsepower and electrical advances, so the requirement for an entirely new ground combat vehicle built from the outset from lessons learned in combat from the previous decade remains. The Army's own budget proposal unveiled on 4 March discontinued the program, and instead funds were shifted to the AMPV program as the main vehicle priority and to improving the Bradley IFV in the interim until more resources become available. Incremental improvements <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> current vehicle fleets to improve protection and networking abilities. [...] $131 million will be directed into science and technology to look at the feasibility of future combat vehicle technologies, and Secretary Hagel has directed the Army, as well as the Marine Corps, to deliver [...] "realistic" [...] visions for vehicle modernization by the end of FY 2014.|$|E
500|$|In {{comparing}} {{the achievements of}} Scott and Amundsen, most polar historians generally accept that Amundsen's skills with ski and dogs, his general familiarity with ice conditions, and his clear focus on a non-scientific expedition gave him considerable advantages {{in the race for}} the Pole. Scott's verdict on the disaster that overtook his party, written when he was close to death, lists the initial loss of pony transport, weather conditions, [...] "a shortage of fuel in our depots for which I cannot account", and the sickening of Evans and Oates, but ultimately Scott concludes that [...] "our wreck is certainly due to this sudden advent of severe weather [...] on the Barrier [...] in the day, [...] at night". Presumably with regard to the failed rendez-vous with the dog teams requested for 1 March 1912, Scott furthermore wrote [...] "No-one is to blame and I hope no attempt <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> suggest that we have lacked support". Cherry-Garrard, whom Atkinson placed in charge of the dog teams which started late, failed to meet Scott and turned for home, observes that [...] "the whole business simply bristles with 'ifs'"; an accumulation of decisions and circumstances that might have fallen differently ultimately led to catastrophe. But [...] "we were as wise as anyone can be before the event." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the return}} {{journey from the}} Pole, Scott reached the 82.30°S meeting point for the dog teams, three days ahead of schedule, noting in his diary for 27 February 1912 [...] "We are {{naturally}} always discussing possibility of meeting dogs, where and when, etc. It is a critical position. We may find ourselves in safety at the next depot, {{but there is a}} horrid element of doubt." [...] By 10 March the temperature had dropped unexpectedly to below , and it became evident the dog teams were not coming: [...] "The dogs which would have been our salvation have evidently failed. Meares [...] had a bad trip home I suppose. It's a miserable jumble." [...] With 400miles (670km) still to travel across the Ross Ice Shelf, Scott's party's prospects steadily worsened as, with deteriorating weather, a puzzling lack of fuel in the depots, hunger and exhaustion, they struggled northward. In a farewell letter to Sir Edgar Speyer, dated 16 March, Scott wondered whether he had overshot the meeting point and fought the growing suspicion that he had in fact been abandoned by the dog teams: [...] "We very nearly came through, and it's a pity to have missed it, but lately I have felt that we have overshot our mark. No-one is to blame and I hope no attempt <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> suggest that we had lacked support." [...] On the same day, Oates, whose toes had become frostbitten, voluntarily left the tent and walked to his death. Scott wrote that Oates' last words were [...] "I am just going outside and may be some time".|$|E
