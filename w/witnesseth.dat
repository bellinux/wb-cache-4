6000|$|Your thirteenth {{chapter is}} to show, 'That our Saviour's preferring the {{business}} of making men holy, before any other, <b>witnesseth,</b> that this is to do the best service to God.' ...|$|E

6000|$|For dire was Alfred in his hour [...] The pale scribe <b>witnesseth,</b> [...] More mighty {{in defeat}} was he [...] Than all men else in victory, [...] And behind, his men came murderously, [...] Dry-throated, {{drinking}} death.|$|E
6000|$|And the Breton to the Norman spoke, like a {{small child}} spoke he, [...] And his sea-blue eyes were empty as his home beside the sea: [...] “There are more windows in one house than there are eyes to see, [...] There are more doors in a man’s house, but God has hid the key: [...] Ruin is a builder of windows; her legend <b>witnesseth</b> [...] Barbara, the saint of gunners, and a stay in sudden death.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 3. All {{men have}} not faith, this the Apostle <b>witnesseth</b> {{in so many}} words as we find (2 Thess 3:2; Deut 32:20). Also in Timothy 1:15 'Unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure,' &c. It appeareth also in this, that all do not attain salvation, which they must needs do if they had true {{justifying}} faith (compare Luke 13:24 and 1 John 5:19 with Mark 16:16. And Heb 4:3 with vv 6 and 11 'they that believe shall be saved').|$|E

60|$|Master,--In the Boreal and Septentrional lands, turned {{aside from}} the noonday and the sun, there dwelt of old (as thou knowest, and as Olaus voucheth) a race of men, brave, strong, nimble, and adventurous, who had no other care but to fight and drink. There, by reason of the cold (as Virgil <b>witnesseth),</b> men break wine with axes. To their minds, when once they were dead and gotten to Valhalla, or the place of their Gods, {{there would be no}} other {{pleasure}} but to swig, tipple, drink, and boose till the coming of that last darkness and Twilight, wherein they, with their deities, should do battle against the enemies of all mankind; which day they rather desired than dreaded.|$|E
60|$|It were fitter for {{a volume}} than a preface, {{but so much}} as to repeat the {{contents}} of their cruel sufferings; from professors {{as well as from}} profane, and from magistrates as well as the rabble: that it may be said of this abused and despised people, they went forth weeping, and sowed in tears, bearing testimony to the precious seed, even the seed of the kingdom, which stands not in words, the finest, the highest that man's wit can use; but in power, the power of Christ Jesus, to whom God the Father hath given all power in heaven and in earth, that he might rule angels above, and men below. Who empowered them, as their work <b>witnesseth,</b> by the many that were turned through their ministry, from darkness to light, and out of the broad into the narrow way of life and peace: bringing people to a weighty, serious, and God-like conversation; the practice of that doctrine which they taught.|$|E
6000|$|... 332. When I {{have indeed}} {{conceited}} that I might be banished for my profession, then I {{have thought of}} that scripture, [...] "They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword; they wandered about in sheep skins and goat skins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented, of whom the world was not worthy" [...] (Heb 11:37), for all {{they thought they were}} too bad to dwell and abide amongst them. I have also thought of that saying, [...] "The Holy Ghost <b>witnesseth</b> in every city, that bonds and afflictions abide me." [...] I have verily thought that my soul and it[74] have sometimes reasoned about the sore and sad estate of a banished and exiled condition, how they are exposed to hunger, to cold, to perils, to nakedness, to enemies, and a thousand calamities; and at last, it may be, to die in a ditch, like a poor forlorn and desolate sheep. But I thank God, hitherto I have not been moved by these most delicate reasonings, but have rather, by them, more approved my heart to God.|$|E

6000|$|... (1.) There is the devil, that accuser of the brethren, that accuses {{them before}} God, {{day and night}} (Rev 12:10). This prince of {{darkness}} is unwearied in this work; he doth it, as you see, day and night; that is, without ceasing. He continually puts in his caveats against thee, if so be he may prevail. How did he ply16 it against that good man Job, if possibly he might have obtained his destruction in hell-fire? He objected against him, that he served not God for nought, and tempted God to put forth his hand against him, urging, {{that if he did}} it, he would curse him to his face; and all this, as God <b>witnesseth,</b> [...] "he did without a cause" [...] (Job 1:9-11; 2:4,5). How did he ply it with Christ against Joshua the high-priest? [...] "And he showed me Joshua," [...] said the prophet, [...] "the high-priest, standing before the angel of the Lord, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him" [...] (Zech 3:1).|$|E
60|$|It is {{not always}} on remote islands peopled with pagans that great {{disasters}} occur, as memory <b>witnesseth.</b> Nor are {{the forces of nature}} inadequate to production of a fiercer throe than any that we have known. The situation is this: we are tied by the feet to a fragile shell imperfectly confining a force powerful enough under favoring conditions, to burst it asunder and set the fragments wallowing and grinding together in liquid flame, in the blind fury of a readjustment. Nay, it needs no such stupendous cataclysm to depeople this uneasy orb. Let but a square mile be blown out of the bottom of the sea, or a great rift open there. Is it to be supposed that we would be unaffected in the altered conditions generated by a contest between the ocean and the earth's molten core? These fatalities are not only possible but in the highest degree probable. It is probable, indeed, that they have occurred over and over again, effacing all the more highly organized forms of life, and compelling the slow march of evolution to begin anew. Slow? On the stage of Eternity the passing of races--the entrances and exits of Life--are incidents in a brisk and lively drama, following one another with confusing rapidity.|$|E
5000|$|An {{indenture}} was a legal contract {{enforced by}} the courts. One indenture reads as follows:This INDENTURE <b>Witnesseth</b> that James Best a Labourer doth Voluntarily put himself Servant to CaptainStephen Jones Master of the Snow Sally to serve the said Stephen Jones and his Assigns, for and during the full Space, Time and Term of three Years from the first Day of the said James’ arrival in Philadelphia in AMERICA, during which Time or Term the said Master or his Assigns shall and will find and supply the said James with sufficient Meat, Drink, Apparel, Lodging and all other necessaries befitting such a Servant, {{and at the end}} and expiration of said Term, the said James to be made Free, and receive according to the Custom of the Country. Provided nevertheless, and these Presents are on this Condition, that if the said James shall pay the said Stephen Jones or his Assigns 15 Pounds British in twenty one Days after his arrival he shall be Free, and the above Indenture and every Clause therein, absolutely Void and of no Effect.

5000|$|The Association for the Establishment and Maintenance FOR the People in the City of New York of Museums OF the Peaceful Arts: This {{instrument}} <b>witnesseth</b> That the Regents of the University of the State of New York have granted this charter for {{the purpose}} of forming a corporation to establish and maintain as a permanent and useful memorial of the century of peace and amity that has followed the signing of the Treaty of Ghent on Christmas Eve, 1814, in the City of New York, and for the people thereof, and {{for the benefit of the}} citizens of the State of New York and of the United States generally, buildings which shall be devoted to the housing and proper exposition of permanent exhibits in the following branches, among others, of the industrial and peaceful arts: (a) Electricity (b) Steam (c) Astronomy and Navigation (d) Safety appliances (e) Aviation (f) Mechanical Arts (g) Agriculture (h) Mining (i) Labor (J) Efficiency (k) Historic Records (1) Health and Hygiene (m) Textiles (n) Ceramics and Clays (o) Architecture (P) Scenic Embellishment (q) Gardening (r) Roads and Road Building materials (s) Commerce and Trade (t) Printing and Books and with the further purpose and power to establish and to maintain a library building which shall contain books and periodicals giving information in respect of the subjects covered by the various museums; to erect and to maintain a building containing an auditorium for purposes of popular assembly, with contiguous rooms for committee meetings, lectures, and the various purposes incident to the operation of such a group of museums; to perform all the functions pertaining to the maintenance and operation of museums and concomitant institutions relating in any way to the development of the peaceful arts and progress in industrial education; and to open the museums, the library and the assembly rooms for the uses of the schools, the colleges and the universities of the City and State of New York, and, in particular, to bring about the creation of such a museum institution as shall be of greatest utility and advantage to the people of the City, State and Nation in the fostering and furtherance of commercial and industrial education." ...|$|E
5000|$|Among {{the various}} {{writings}} left by Samuel is a Confession of Faith {{which includes a}} statement as to his opinion of the higher mystical significance of the Holy Communion. Even this, however, was insufficient for the inquisitors who demanded obedience to the doctrine of transsubstantiation:"As soon as I hear these most comfortable and heavenly words spoken and pronounced by {{the mouth of the}} minister, 'This is My Body, which is given for you,' when I hear (I say) this heavenly harmony of God's infallible promises and truth, I look not upon, neither do I behold bread and wine; for I take and believe the words simply and plainly, even as Christ spake them. For hearing these words, my senses be rapt and utterly excluded, for faith wholly taketh place, and not flesh, nor the carnal imaginations of our gross fleshly and unreverent eating, after the manner of our bodily food, which profiteth nothing at all, as Christ <b>witnesseth,</b> but with a sorrowful and wounded conscience, and hungry and thirsty soul, and pure and faithful mind, do fully embrace, behold and feed and look upon, that most glorious body of Christ in Heaven at the right hand of God the Father, very God and very Man, which was crucified and was slain, and His blood shed for our sins, there now making intercession, offering and giving His holy body for me, for my body, for my ransom, for my full price and satisfaction, who is my Christ, and all that ever he hath, and by this spiritual and faithful eating of this lively and heavenly bread I feel the most sweet sap and taste of the fruits, benefits and unspeakable joys of Christ's death and passion, fully digested into my soul.For my mind is quieted from all worldly adversities, turmoilings, and troubles, my conscience is pacified from sin, death, hell and damnation; my soul is full, and hath even enough, and will no more; for all things are but loss, vile dung and dross, vain vanity, for the excellent knowledge-sake of Christ Jesus, my Lord and Saviour. Thus now is Christ's flesh my very meat indeed, and His blood my very drink indeed, and I am become flesh of His flesh and bone of His bones. Now I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me. Yea, I dwell in Him, and He in me, for, through faith in Christ and for Christ's sake, we are one - that is, of one consent, mind, and fellowship with the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Thus am I assured and fully persuaded, and on this rock have I builded, by God's grace, my dwelling and resting-place, for body and soul, life and death. And thus I commit my cause, under Christ, the righteous and just Judge, who will another day judge these debates and controversies, whom I humbly beseech to cast His tender and merciful eyes upon the afflicted and ruinous churches, and shortly to reduce them into a godly and perpetual concord." ...|$|E
