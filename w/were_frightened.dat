On their second run, they dropped bombs and napalm before firing rockets and strafing the presidential compound with machine-gun fire. The two continued their runs for 30 minutes before units loyal to the president arrived and launched a counter-attack.|$|E
5|$|The Haunting was {{released}} on 18 September 1963. Audiences <b>were</b> <b>frightened</b> by it. Film critic Dora Jane Hamblin related how four of her female friends, expecting a ho-hum film, took out make-up during the film's first few minutes {{with the intention of}} fixing their faces. The film proved so frightening, she said, that the women were jumping out of their seats and losing their items. In Houston, Texas, a local cinema promoted the film as so chilling that it held a contest to see which of four patrons could sit all the way through a midnight screening; the prize was $100. Despite these stunts, The Haunting was only an average success at the box office.|$|E

25|$|In the 1980s Israel and United Kingdom {{opened up}} part of their {{archives}} for investigation by historians. This favored a more critical and factual analysis of the 1948 events. As a result more detailed and comprehensive description of the Palestinian exodus was published, notably Morris' The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem. Morris distinguishes four waves of refugees, the second, third and fourth of them coinciding with Israeli military offensives, when Arab Palestinians fled the fighting, <b>were</b> <b>frightened</b> away, or were expelled.|$|E

In this tradition, the spirit falls in love with the central character 'Mary' leading to her death, reminiscent of vampire lore. The supernatural powers attributed to the Tennessee spirit have also been compared to that of jinn in mythology.|$|E

25|$|Howitzers {{were best}} suited for {{long-range}} fire. When howitzers and cannons were mixed in artillery batteries, the howitzers tended to be used at the shorter ranges where cannons were more effective. This led to a higher expenditure of ammunition. While artillery could be very destructive, it also exercised a psychological effect. Soldiers <b>were</b> <b>frightened</b> of long range artillery fire to which their short-ranged muskets could not respond. If possible, the British deployed their soldiers behind crests to minimize losses from artillery fire, but all other nations usually deployed their troops in the open. At close ranges, the gunners fired canister shot, an anti-personnel weapon. A canister round spewed a load of musket balls toward the target, when fired. Normally, howitzers fired shells at their targets. Unlike cannons which fired on a more flat trajectory, howitzers were designed to throw a shell on an arching trajectory.|$|E
25|$|The {{cannonball}} or {{round shot}} was the projectile most often used. Both direct and ricochet fire {{could be used}} to hit a target. Round shot was most effective when used against formed troops in column and was somewhat less effective against troops in line. Soldiers <b>were</b> <b>frightened</b> of long range artillery fire because their short-ranged muskets could not retaliate against the gunners. The British deployed their soldiers on reverse slopes when possible to avoid losses from artillery fire, but all other nations generally arrayed their soldiers in the open. However, when under a severe bombardment by 50 Austrian guns at the Battle of Aspern-Essling, the French Imperial Guard redeployed from a 3-deep line to a 1-deep line to minimize losses and keep the appearance of a solid front. At closer ranges, the gunners switched to canister, an anti-personnel weapon. When canister was fired, its load of musket balls flew toward the target while spreading out.|$|E
25|$|In early April 1288 {{the naval}} fleet, led by Omar and escorted by infantry, fled home along the Bạch Đằng river. As bridges and roads were {{destroyed}} and attacks were launched by Đại Việt troops, the Mongols reached Bạch Đằng without an infantry escort. Đại Việt's small flotilla engaged in battle {{and pretended to}} retreat. The Mongols eagerly pursued the Đại Việt troops only to fall into their pre-arranged battlefield. Thousands of small Đại Việt boats quickly appeared from both banks, launched a fierce attack that broke the Mongols' combat formation. The Mongols, meeting such a sudden and strong attack, in panic tried to withdraw to the sea. The Mongols' boats were halted, and many were damaged and sank. At that time, a number of fire rafts quickly rushed toward the Mongols, who <b>were</b> <b>frightened</b> and jumped down to reach the banks where they were dealt a heavy blow by an army led by the Trần king and Trần Hưng Đạo.|$|E

25|$|When Sun Quan was {{in control}} of the Wu territories, the lands were not very {{peaceful}} as the Shanyue tribes in the region often raided counties and caused much trouble. Huang Gai was sent to pacify the Shanyue. Once, Huang Gai was assigned to oversee Shicheng County (石城縣; present-day Shicheng County, Jiangxi), and he knew that the local officials did not follow the laws and were difficult to control. After entering the county office, he chose two officers to be his assistants and ordered them to manage the office. He also gave instructions for all the officers to abide by rules and regulations and perform their duties well. The two officers were afraid of Huang Gai so they put in full effort in their work. However, as time passed, they realised that Huang Gai did not inspect their work, so they became lax and reverted to their old ways. Huang Gai was actually aware of what had been going on. He invited all the local officials to attend a banquet later and exposed the two officers' misdeeds in front of everyone. The officers <b>were</b> <b>frightened</b> and started begging for their lives, but Huang Gai had them executed. This incident shocked everyone in the county. Huang Gai was later reassigned to be the Chief (長) of Chungu County (春穀縣; northwest of present-day Fanchang County, Anhui) and as the Prefect (令) of Xunyang County (尋陽縣; southwest of present-day Huangmei County, Hubei). The nine counties under his governorship were peaceful and stable. Huang Gai was subsequently promoted to Commandant (都尉) of Danyang Commandery (丹楊郡; around present-day Nanjing, Jiangsu). He helped the poor and earned the respect of the Shanyue.|$|E

He gives the two their first Jiggy as a token of gratitude to help find them. Meanwhile, Gruntilda's sisters introduce her to a cannon called the [...] "Big-O-Blaster" [...] (B.O.B.) that can suck the life force from any given target. They test B.O.B. on King Jingaling, who consequently is turned into a zombie. Gruntilda plans to charge B.O.B. long enough to blast the entire island and use the stolen life force to restore her body. The witch's most loyal minion, Klungo, is sent out to hinder Banjo and Kazooie in their progress by fighting them, but after taking many beatings from Gruntilda as punishment for losing to them, Klungo eventually abandons her and sides with Banjo and Kazooie.|$|E

500|$|Sherwood's {{vigorous}} anti-Catholicism appears {{most obviously}} in her {{works from the}} 1820s and 1830s. During the 1820s in Britain, Catholics were agitating for greater civil rights {{and it was at}} this time that Sherwood wrote her most sustained attacks against them. When the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 was passed, Sherwood and many like her <b>were</b> <b>frightened</b> of the influence that Catholics might gain in the government. Therefore, she wrote Victoria (1833), The Nun (1833) and The Monk of Cimies (1834) in order to illustrate some of the dangers of Catholicism. The Monk narrates, in the first person, Edmund Etherington's decision to renounce the Church of England and join the Catholic church. While a monk, he ridicules his fellow brothers, plans a murder and debauches a young woman. But evangelicals were not all in agreement on the issue of Catholic Emancipation and some were uncomfortable with these books; one evangelical reviewer called The Monk of Cimies [...] "unfair and unconvincing." ...|$|E
500|$|The growing {{success of}} the comuneros emboldened people to accuse members of the old {{government}} of complicity with royal abuses. [...] The protests attacked the landed nobility as well, {{many of whom had}} illegally taken property during the reign of the regents and weak kings after Isabella's death. [...] In Dueñas, the Count of Buendía's vassals revolted against him on September 1, 1520, encouraged by rebel monks. [...] This uprising was followed by others of a similar anti-feudal nature. [...] The leadership of the comuneros was forced to take a stance on these new rebellions; reluctant to openly endorse them, the Junta initially denounced them but did nothing to oppose them. [...] The dynamics of the uprising thus changed profoundly, as it could now jeopardize the status of the entire manorial system. [...] The nobles had previously been somewhat sympathetic to the cause due to their loss of privileges to the central government. [...] However, these new developments lead to a dramatic drop in support for the comuneros from aristocrats, who <b>were</b> <b>frightened</b> by the more radical elements of the revolution.|$|E
500|$|Texas' Spanish Royal Governor, Martín de Alarcón was {{the first}} {{documented}} European to tour the bay while exploring Matagorda Bay with Tejas guides in 1718. During the expedition, two Karankawa Indians were spotted near the bay going about their daily lives and <b>were</b> <b>frightened</b> {{at the sight of}} Alarcón and his men. [...] They quickly swam across the bay despite the guides' signal to them that Alarcón meant no harm. The next day, the Indians came ashore from a sixteen-passenger canoe (which could hold 4 men, 4 women and 8 children) and notified the Tejas guide that they wished for Alarcón and his men to leave. As a peace offering, Alarcón presented the Indians with tobacco and clothing on behalf of the Spanish crown, which they accepted. In exchange, the Indians offered Alarcón dried fish, and directed him toward the former French fort of St. Louis, believing Alarcón wanted to establish a colony on the bay. Alarcón declared the bay for Spain, but did not establish a permanent settlement.|$|E
