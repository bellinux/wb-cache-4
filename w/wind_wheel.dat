The cylindrical casings are open at each end with a larger opening facing the wind. The wind catches a number of wheels and feathered vanes fixed to a shaft revolving in bearings inside the casings. When the wind has passed between the vanes of the front wheel it is directed by the guide vanes to the second wheel and is again taken up by guides and passed to a third wheel and so on, the action each time increasing the effect of the wind on the shaft and improving efficiency.

6000|$|This Mwres--the civility of [...] "Mr." [...] had {{vanished}} ages ago--was {{one of the}} officials under the Wind Vane and Waterfall Trust, the great company that owned every <b>wind</b> <b>wheel</b> and waterfall in the world, and which pumped all the water and supplied all the electric energy that people in these latter days required. He lived in a vast hotel near that part of London called Seventh Way, and had very large and comfortable apartments on the seventeenth floor. Households and family life had long since disappeared with the progressive refinement of manners; and indeed the steady rise in rents and land values, the disappearance of domestic servants, the elaboration of cookery, had rendered the separate domicile of Victorian times impossible, even had any one desired such a savage seclusion. When his toilet was completed he went towards {{one of the two}} doors of his apartment--there were doors at opposite ends, each marked with a huge arrow pointing one one way and one the other--touched a stud to open it, and emerged on a wide passage, the centre of which bore chairs and was moving at a steady pace to the left. On some of these chairs were seated gaily-dressed men and women. He nodded to an acquaintance--it was not in those days etiquette to talk before breakfast--and seated himself on one of these chairs, and in a few seconds he had been carried to the doors of a lift, by which he descended to the great and splendid hall in which his breakfast would be automatically served.|$|E

The measured results and calculative results {{provide a basis for}} avoiding resonance and further study of structure dynamic response of wind turbines tower; In addition, it can provide valuable modal parameter data for wind tower design and structural vibration control. The tower of horizontal-axis wind turbine, on the top of which fits engine-room of great mass and revolving <b>wind</b> <b>wheel</b> which bring forth live load to the tower. Under the action of natural wind, the different of wind speed, wind direction and wind presssure also will bring forth different live load to the tower. As the combined action of them, the loads would lead to distortion and vibration of the tower. The vibration would not only bring forth the tower's extra-stress which will affect the structural strength, but also affected the distortion and vibration of the <b>wind</b> <b>wheel.</b> Meanwhile, it's possible that the tower would resonate with revolving <b>wind</b> <b>wheel</b> and thus affected the performance of wind unit...|$|E
40|$|A {{wind turbine}} located in Yunnan {{is taken as}} an example in this paper. By using the {{analytical}} method and the finite element method, the modal analysis of wind turbine tower is carried out, then the structural dynamic behavior is obtained. Based on the comparison of the results from different calculation methods, the rigidity and the resonance of tower induced by <b>wind</b> <b>wheel</b> rotation are studied. The research shows that, the finite element model is simplified, while {{the results of this}} method are rich; the transient resonance inevitably appears for two times in the starting process for the flexible wind tower which has the structure of symmetry basically; while in the normal operation stage, the <b>wind</b> <b>wheel</b> would not induce the resonance for flexible tower. The research provides a theoretical basis for the design of wind turbine tower...|$|E

30|$|The system {{operates}} in the rated operating state {{by adjusting the}} pitch angle to limit the wind energy captured by the <b>wind</b> <b>wheel</b> since the wind speed exceeds vN.

40|$|Modal {{testing was}} used {{to show that the}} {{roundabout}} swing was a natural vibration mode of the <b>wind</b> <b>wheel</b> of a horizontal-axis wind turbine (HAWT). During the vibration, the blade root was simultaneously subjected to bending and rotary shear stresses. A method for indirect testing and determination of the dynamic frequencies of the typical vibrations of the <b>wind</b> <b>wheel</b> was developed, based on the frequency-holding characteristic of each subsignal during the transmission of the multiple mixed-vibration signals. The developed method enabled simple and accurate acquisition of the dynamic frequencies without destruction of the flow and structural fields. The dynamic vibration stress of the roundabout swing was found to be significantly stronger than those of the first- and second-order flexural vibrations of the blades. By a combination of numerical simulations and tests, it was determined that the pneumatic circumferential force was the primary determinant of the roundabout swing vibration frequencies, the relationship being quadratic. The roundabout swing vibration potentially offers new explanations and analytical pathways regarding the behavior of horizontal-axis wind turbines, which {{have been found to be}} frequently involved in fatigue-damage accidents within periods shorter than their design lives...|$|E
