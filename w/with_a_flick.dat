5|$|The Queen {{is one of}} the Overtakers, villains of The Kingdom Keepers novel series. She was {{introduced}} in 2011 in the fourth book of the saga, Power Play, alongside Cruella De Vil. Like Maleficent, she is very powerful and is able to cast almost any spell <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> of her finger; she can also transform herself and other characters. In Power Play, when Maleficent and Chernabog are captured by the Keepers, the Queen becomes the new leader of the Overtakers.|$|E
5|$|Newly hatched New Guinea {{crocodiles}} feed on aquatic insects, spiders, tadpoles, freshwater snails, frogs, {{fish and}} small mammals. As they grow, {{so does the}} size of their prey and their consumption of fish rises, but they still will eat anything of a worthwhile size that they can find. An adult's diet is largely fish, caught by sweeping the snout sideways and snapping at the prey, but also includes shrimps, crabs, frogs, snakes, birds and medium-sized mammals. A crocodile catches its prey by stealth <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> of its head, impaling it with its sharp teeth and gripping and crushing it. The jaws cannot move sideways to chew the food; instead, the crocodile's head is tossed to move the prey {{to the back of the}} mouth before the prey is swallowed whole. This crocodile is surprisingly agile and can lunge its body upward into the air to catch bats, flying birds, and leaping fish. It can also probe into the mud at the bottom of a river or swamp with its snout to search for crabs and molluscs.|$|E
25|$|If the tubing label {{has been}} lost, a {{high-quality}} (chromoly or manganese) steel frame can {{be recognized by}} tapping it sharply <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> of the fingernail. A high-quality frame will produce a bell-like ring where a regular-quality steel frame will produce a dull thunk. They can also be recognized by their weight (around 2.5kg for frame and forks) {{and the type of}} lugs and fork ends used.|$|E

25|$|Mendis, {{although}} {{classified as}} slow-medium, bowls {{a mixture of}} deliveries, including googlies, off-breaks, top-spinners, flippers and leg-breaks, {{as well as the}} carrom ball, released <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> of his middle finger. For Sri Lanka Army in 2007–08 he averaged a mere 10.56 and took 46 wickets in six games, his strike rate a startling 31. This gained him a call-up to the full Sri Lanka squad for the Caribbean tour in April 2008.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} one cord (called the {{retention}} cord) a finger-loop is formed. At the end of the other cord (the release cord,) it is a common practice to form a knot or a tab. The release cord will be held between finger and thumb to be released at just the right moment, and may have a complex braid to add bulk to the end. This makes the knot easier to hold, and the extra weight allows the loose end of a discharged sling to be recovered <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> of the wrist.|$|E
25|$|The {{pivoting}} {{part that}} supports the cylinder is called the crane; it is the weak point of swing-out cylinder designs. Using the method often portrayed in movies and television of flipping the cylinder open and closed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> of the wrist can in fact cause the crane to bend over time, throwing the cylinder out of alignment with the barrel. Lack of alignment between chamber and barrel is a dangerous condition, as it can impede the bullet's transition from chamber to barrel. This gives rise to higher pressures in the chamber, bullet damage, {{and the potential for}} an explosion if the bullet becomes stuck.|$|E
5000|$|Wood Pink"...is the elf designer. When {{it comes}} to good taste there's no one finer. She's {{in charge of all}} the colors of nature...the trees, sky, leaves, and every living creature. <b>With</b> just <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> from her butterfly-tipped wand she can {{camouflage}} an elephant, turn a brunette into a blonde." ...|$|R

25|$|There {{are also}} some {{specialised}} passes {{that can be used}} during a rugby game. The 'dive-pass' is a pass which is sometimes used by the scrum-half if they are unable to get into the correct position for a long pass. The player dives as they release the ball, resulting in a quick pass. A 'flick-pass' is similar to a standard pass except the ball is passed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> of the wrists, making it a faster pass but with less distance. The 'pop-pass' is a short pass where the ball is simply popped up in a small loop to a player. The 'gut-pass' is a pass straight into the stomach area of a player and is mostly used by the forwards when moving the ball back through a maul.|$|E
500|$|Boycott {{was again}} refused the {{captaincy}} {{for the next}} Test series against India over the winter of 1981–82. Angered by this decision, he stated that [...] "even the Yorkshire Ripper got a fair trial in the dock but I've not been given a single chance." [...] He later battled Keith Fletcher over his slow scoring rate, playing Fletcher's comments to him during a press conference using a tape recorder. The series against India was to be his last. In his final ODI match during England's tour he scored 6 from 12 deliveries. During the following Test series he passed Sobers' career run record, hitting 60 in the first Test, 36 and 50 in the second to take him 81 runs short, and in the third Test he overtook the record <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> off his pads for four. He became the leading Test run-scorer. In his last Test match, the fourth of the tour, taking place in January 1982, he scored 18 and six. During the tour, Boycott claimed he was too ill to field in a Test Match, but it was later discovered that he was playing golf while his teammates were still out on the field.|$|E
500|$|Ian Brady {{was born}} in Glasgow as Ian Duncan Stewart on 2 January 1938 to Margaret [...] "Peggy" [...] Stewart, an {{unmarried}} tea room waitress. The identity of Brady's father has never been reliably ascertained, although his mother {{said he was a}} reporter working for a Glasgow newspaper, who died three months before Brady was born. Stewart had little support, and after a few months was forced to give her son into the care of Mary and John Sloan, a local couple with four children of their own. Brady took their name, and became known as Ian Sloan. His mother continued to visit him throughout his childhood. Various authors have stated that he tortured animals, although Brady objected to such accusations. Aged nine, he visited Loch Lomond with his family, where he reportedly discovered an affinity for the outdoors, and a few months later the family moved to a new council house on an overspill estate at Pollok. He was accepted for Shawlands Academy, a school for above-average pupils. At Shawlands his behaviour worsened; as a teenager he twice appeared before a juvenile court for housebreaking. He left the academy aged 15, and {{took a job as a}} tea boy at a Harland and Wolff shipyard in Govan. Nine months later, he began working as a butcher's messenger boy. He had a girlfriend, Evelyn Grant, but their relationship ended when he threatened her <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> knife after she visited a dance with another boy. He again appeared before the court, this time with nine charges against him, and shortly before his 17th birthday he was placed on probation, on condition that he live with his mother. By then she had moved to Manchester and married an Irish fruit merchant named Patrick Brady, and it was the latter who got Brady a job as a fruit porter at Smithfield Market.|$|E

The Doctor later receives a new one, which emerges from the newly regenerated TARDIS console. The Eleventh Doctor's sonic screwdriver is larger than its predecessor; it has a green light and metal claws that extend <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> of the wrist. It is shown to have been created by the TARDIS {{as part of its}} automatic regeneration.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2011, Stephen Fry's 100 Greatest Gadgets {{was shown}} on Channel 4 {{as one of}} the 100 Greatest strand. His choice for the {{greatest}} gadget was the cigarette lighter, which he described as [...] "fire <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> of the fingers". In the same month, the nature documentary series Ocean Giants, narrated by Fry, premiered. In September 2011, Fry's Planet Word, a five-part documentary about language, aired on BBC HD and BBC Two. In November 2011, an episode of Living The Life featured Fry in an intimate conversation discussing his life and career with Rolling Stones bass player Bill Wyman.|$|E
5000|$|The Zune Pad, {{which is}} a squircle, is the primary control [...] for Zune 4, 8, 16, 80 and 120. The pad lets users of this device scroll through {{a long list of}} songs <b>with</b> <b>a</b> few <b>flicks</b> of the finger, then press the button to select tracks or change the volume.|$|R

The smoker may also use any of those methods to blow into a cloud of smoke outside his mouth.|$|R
50|$|Uniquely, Pelomedusa {{does not}} have a hinged {{plastron}} (lower shell). All the other species in the family Pelomedusidae, however, have this feature which they can, using muscles, close to cover their heads and front limbs. Unlike many chelonians, African helmeted turtles are able, when they find themselves upside down, to right themselves <b>with</b> <b>a</b> vigorous <b>flick</b> from their long muscular necks.|$|R
2500|$|Babo then draws a spot {{of blood}} from Don Benito <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> of his razor, an {{accident}} he calls [...] "Babo's first blood" [...] and blames on Don Benito's shaking. He then concludes Don Benito's toilette with a comb, as if {{to put on a}} show for Delano. Then, just when Delano has preceded the other two out of the cabin, Babo cuts himself in the cheek. On deck, he shows Delano the bleeding and explains that this is Don Benito's punishment for the accident. Delano is momentarily shocked by this Spanish cruelty, but when he sees Babo and Don Benito reconciled he is relieved to notice that the outrage has passed.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the third}} day, a century from Ponting and late hitting from Gilchrist helped Australia {{to limit the}} deficit and prevent the follow on, {{but they were still}} behind on first innings. An hour's play was lost due to rain, but when it did start Ponting and Hussey batted {{together}} {{for two and a half}} hours, adding 130 before Botha got his first Test wicket when a straighter ball from the spinner had Hussey caught behind. The Cricinfo report claimed that Hussey was [...] "extremely lucky to survive an lbw shout on 9 off Nel", but he did go on to make 45; Ponting was on 97 when the partnership was broken, and brought up the century <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> wide of mid-on. He thus became the sixth man to score a century in his 100th Test.|$|E
2500|$|Under a {{cloudless}} {{late afternoon}} sky at Sharjah, full to capacity with 14,000 spectators, Afghanistan captain Nawroz Mangal won the toss and elected to bat on a wicket which favoured batting. [...] The opening pair of Karim Sadiq and Noor Ali Zadran started brightly, with Sadiq scoring the first {{boundary of the}} innings from the fourth ball <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> off Umar Gul. [...] Zadran was dismissed midway through the fifth over, caught and bowled by Gul for 9. [...] Wicket-keeper Mohammad Shahzad joined Sadiq at the crease and the two batted aggressively against the opening bowlers of Gul and Wahab Riaz. [...] Sadiq recorded the first six of the match in the seventh over, striking a slower ball from Gul over the long on boundary. [...] The following over Shahzad struck Riaz for three consecutive fours, which {{by the end of}} the eighth over took Afghanistan to 47, with a run rate close to 6 runs per over. [...] This aggressive start by the Afghan batsman against the opening bowlers prompted Pakistani captain Misbah-ul-Haq to introduce spinner Saeed Ajmal early to the attack in the ninth over. [...] The introduction of Ajmal, who had just come off the back of taking 24 wickets in Pakistans recently concluded Test series against England, didn't change the attacking mindset of Sadiq and Shahzad. [...] The third delivery of Ajmal's first over was reverse swept for a six by Shahzad. [...] The next over Shahid Afridi came into the attack and almost immediately dismissed Shahzad, thanks largely to a [...] "moment of brilliance" [...] in the field by Asad Shafiq, whose one-handed catch ended an entertaining stand of 31 for the second wicket. [...] The introduction of Afridi to the attack lowered the run-rate considerably, with Afridi's variations of pace and spin leaving the Afghan batsman hesitant in their shot selection. [...] At 71/2 in fourteenth over, Mangal mistimed a slog off Afridi, who bowled the Afghan captain for 11. [...] He followed this up in the sixteenth by dismissing Sadiq to reduce them to 88/4. [...] Gulbodin Naib became his fourth victim of the innings when he misread a googly and was adjudged leg before by umpire Simon Taufel. [...] Mohammad Nabi and Samiullah Shenwari then combined to arrest the Afghan slump, through a measured but at times aggressive partnership. [...] They added 46 runs for the sixth wicket to take the total to 147/4, however Nabi was run out for 32 from 56 balls by a combination of Khan and Mohammad Hafeez, after backing-up too far out of his crease with the score on 165. [...] Mirwais Ashraf then became Afidi's fifth wicket of the match, while Dawlat Zadran and Shenwari took the score to 193. [...] They soon fell and Afghanistan were all out for 195 from 48.3 overs. [...] Karim Sadiq's 40 was the top score in the Afghan innings, while Afridi finished with figures with 5/36 from his ten overs. [...] Gul and Riaz also chipped in with two wickets each, with Ajmal was the most economical bowler.|$|E

5000|$|The {{snap shot}} is a {{combination}} of both the slap-shot and the wrist shot. The shooter begins by cocking the stick back like <b>a</b> slap-shot (however <b>with</b> not such <b>an</b> exaggerated motion), and finishes <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>flicking</b> of the wrist like a wrist shot. The resulting shot has more speed than a wrist shot, while increasing {{the time it takes to}} release the shot, balancing its effectiveness. NHL players noted for their snap-shot include Joe Sakic, Ilya Kovalchuk, Phil Kessel, Thomas Vanek, Nathan Horton, Anže Kopitar, Vincent Lecavalier, Alexander Ovechkin, Mike Bossy and Dany Heatley. Many consider Joe Sakic to be the father of the modern snapshot, as he demonstrated incredible scoring ability while utilizing this quick-release shot throughout his career. He much preferred it to the wrist shot, which he was less known for. During his Career, Phil Kessel has perfected a variation of the snap shot where the player transfers their weight to their Puck foot, or [...] "back foot," [...] and shoot in stride. He has used this to become one of the leagues most dangerous shooters.|$|R
50|$|In recent years, {{the penalty}} corner has gained {{importance}} {{as a goal}} scoring opportunity. Particularly with the technical development of the drag flick. Tactics at penalty corners to set up time for <b>a</b> shot <b>with</b> <b>a</b> drag <b>flick</b> or <b>a</b> hit shot at the goal involve various complex plays, including multiple passes before a deflections towards the goal is made but the most common method of shooting is the direct flick or hit at the goal.|$|R
