Welcome to the Universe. With a powerful line up of phenomenally talented opening bands and having an environmentally acceptable 'green' tour, we are looking forward to yet another chance for us to share something unique with our family of fans that have supported us so passionately and also invite and introduce many others to the world of Thirty Seconds to Mars. Taking this approach gives us the opportunity to set an example and share with others the possibilities of real alternatives for a safer, cleaner world. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> all very soon for what will be an exciting, chaotic circus of insanity, and an unforgettable tour." ...|$|E

If you're the sound men I take you for--no matter who advises you against it--[he fixes his eyes on ROBERTS] you 'll make up your minds to come in, and trust to us to get your terms.

6000|$|... "Excellent, Comrade Jarvis. Nothing {{could be}} better. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> to-morrow, then.

6000|$|... "I don't {{think you}} ought to drive home alone, ma'am," [...] he said, gruffly. [...] "There seem {{to be a lot of}} rowdy parties along this road, and the man will be no use for an hour.

6000|$|... "Don't be {{discouraged}} yet, and don't be in haste to succeed. You are {{only beginning to}} think about your place in the economy of things.

6000|$|The Abbot burst {{again into}} a great laughter. [...] "Come in, thou graceless renegade, and <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> to <b>thee</b> and thy horse; and I will pray to St. Peter; and I doubt not he will have {{patience}} with thee, for he is very merciful; and after all, thy parents have been exceeding good to us, and the righteousness of the father, like his sins, is sometimes visited on the children." ...|$|R

50|$|There is not {{a single}} word for 'thanks,' but the word tenane is used to show {{appreciation}} and is expressed through the clapping of hands. Men clap with their palms and fingers together, while women clap with their hands across each other. During meetings and conversation, sneezing is an indication of disbelief. On leaving, one would say digai, which actually means 'you haven't gone for ever, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> again'. The person staying responds by saying digaidigai.|$|E

5000|$|The {{tour was}} officially {{announced}} on August 31, 2006 by MTV2 {{as a part}} of the $2Bill tour, which previously attracted a diverse mix of music artists, including Beastie Boys, Radiohead, Coldplay, and Kanye West. Set for October 2006, the tour showcased Thirty Seconds to Mars' second studio album A Beautiful Lie. It commenced on October 17, 2006 in Minneapolis, Minnesota and ended on November 25, 2006 in Los Angeles, California. The tour was announced shortly after the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards at which Thirty Seconds to Mars received the MTV2 Award for their single [...] "The Kill". A limited number of tickets per city were made available for $2 each in a special internet pre-sale sponsored by MTV2 and Thirty Seconds to Mars beginning on September 16. Sales for general tickets began the following week on September 23. Determined to offset the impact that the tour would have on the environment, Thirty Seconds to Mars worked to develop strategies that would minimize fuel consumption and all touring vehicles were powered by low-emissions renewable biodiesel, a fuel made partly from vegetable oil. In an interview with MTV News, Jared Leto described the tour as:"This is an amazing time of celebration for us all and we are very excited to join forces with the unique and creative individuals at MTV2 to present what we hope will be one of the most exciting tours of the fall... Welcome to the Universe. With a powerful line up of phenomenally talented opening bands and having an environmentally acceptable 'green' tour, we are looking forward to yet another chance for us to share something unique with our family of fans that have supported us so passionately and also invite and introduce many others to the world of Thirty Seconds to Mars. Taking this approach gives us the opportunity to set an example and share with others the possibilities of real alternatives for a safer, cleaner world. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> all very soon for what will be an exciting, chaotic circus of insanity, and an unforgettable tour." ...|$|E

On 11 June 1959, De Jong reported back to Van den Bergh and was told about the new horizontal-structure, De Jong who was a proponent of a vertical-structure was left with a few remarks. The next day the meeting was continued in the presence of the incoming Secretary-General for the Ministry of Defence Duyverman who was going to be responsible for all financial and budgetary affairs for the Ministry of Defence. De Jong objected, he thought he could not be politically responsible as an Undersecretary if he wasn't responsible for all financial affairs for his own department, Van den Bergh became irritated with De Jongs position on the matter and the meeting was adjourned for June 16, 1959.|$|R
