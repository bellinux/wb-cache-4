5|$|Although Parker {{had promised}} to hold auditions for {{students}} attending the Performing Arts, the school was initially advised by the Board of Education to prevent the students from working on the film, fearing it would affect their studies. It was later announced that filming would occur during the summer <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> were not attending school. Parker distributed casting call advertisements at the Performing Arts school and the High School of Music & Art.|$|E
5|$|The narrator, Charles, {{lives with}} his friend Juste in a large boarding-house {{populated}} almost entirely with students like themselves (Charles is studying law and Juste medicine). The sole exception is their middle-aged neighbor, Z. Marcas, of whom they see only momentary glimpses in the hall. They learn {{that he is a}} copyist, and living on an extremely small salary. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> find themselves lacking the funds for tobacco, Marcas offers them some of his own. They become friends, and he tells them the story of his political career.|$|E
5|$|IQ tests {{generally}} are reliable enough {{that most people}} ages ten and older have similar IQ scores throughout life. Still, some individuals score very differently when taking the same test at different times or when taking more than one kind of IQ test at the same age. For example, many children in the famous longitudinal Genetic Studies of Genius begun in 1921 by Lewis Terman showed declines in IQ as they grew up. Terman recruited school pupils based on referrals from teachers, and gave them his Stanford–Binet IQ test. Children with an IQ above 140 by that test {{were included in the}} study. There were 643 children in the main study group. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> who could be contacted again (503 students) were retested at high school age, they were found to have dropped 9 IQ points on average in Stanford–Binet IQ. More than two dozen children dropped by 15 IQ points and six by 25 points or more. Yet parents of those children thought that the children were still as bright as ever, or even brighter.|$|E
50|$|The {{testing center}} is where tests are {{administered}} for most classes. A testing center clerk gives the correct test to <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> presents a testing pass. <b>The</b> <b>student</b> chooses {{a seat in}} the center, completes the test, and turns it in <b>when</b> completed. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> turns in a test, <b>the</b> <b>students</b> are handed <b>the</b> last sheet of the testing pass to <b>the</b> <b>student.</b> This is proof that <b>the</b> <b>student</b> took a test.|$|R

25|$|On 23 October 1956, a {{peaceful}} student demonstration in Budapest produced {{a list of}} 16 Demands of Hungarians Revolutionaries for reform and greater political freedom. As the students attempted to broadcast these demands, the State Protection Authority made some arrests and tried to disperse the crowd with tear gas. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> attempted to free those arrested, the police opened fire on the crowd, setting off {{a chain of events}} which led to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956.|$|E
25|$|Ms. Frizzle {{takes the}} class {{on a flight}} in the bus over the arctic, showing them how the polar ice caps have melted since Ms. Frizzle's old copy of Our Wonderful World was published. They travel around the earth, observing the impacts of global warming and {{alternative}} energy sources. Returning to their home town, Ms. Frizzle gives the class special goggles to observe the greenhouse-gas molecules in the air. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> return to school, they discuss things people can do to save energy and reduce carbon emissions.|$|E
25|$|Another {{tradition}} is the homecoming cane toss, which {{dates from the}} 1930s. Before the university's homecoming football game, third-year law students run from {{the north end of}} the football field at Camp Randall Stadium to the south end wearing bowler hats and carrying canes. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> reach the goalpost on the south end of the field, they attempt to throw their canes over the goalpost. Legend has it that if the student successfully throws the cane over the goalpost and catches it, she will win her first case; if she fails to catch it, the opposite will hold true.|$|E
30|$|In other words, the {{probability}} of repeating a grade at ISCED 2 was 4.3 times greater <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> had repeated at ISCED 1 than <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> had not. <b>The</b> respective odds ratio was 6.2. If grade repetition was {{an effective way to}} overcome learning deficits at an early age, both the ratio of probabilities and the odds ratio would be closer to 1 instead of 4.3 and 6.2, respectively.|$|R

25|$|This radicalism {{continued}} into the 1970s when the higher education component of Leeds College of Art was split from the college to form {{the nucleus of the}} new multidisciplinary Leeds Polytechnic, now called Leeds Beckett University. Performance art had been taught earlier at Leeds College of Art, notably by the Fluxus artist Robin Page during his time as a tutor there in the mid-1960s, but in 1977 a performance art work hit the national news headlines <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> Pete Parkin and Derek Wain used an air pistol to shoot a line up of live budgerigars {{in front of an audience}} at Leeds Polytechnic.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} to explain {{the killing of the}} students. The students all attended a local teacher training college with a history of left-wing activism and radicalism, {{but it is not clear}} that they were targeted for their political beliefs. Some think that they may have angered Guerreros Unidos by refusing to pay extortion money. Others believe there may be a link between the students' disappearance and a speech given by the wife of Iguala's mayor on the day of the clashes. She was speaking to local dignitaries <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> were protesting in Iguala and some believe they may have been targeted because it was feared they could disrupt the event.|$|E
25|$|Frost later teams up {{with the}} X-Men to defeat the Phalanx, and in the process, rescue {{a select group of}} teenage mutants who become a superhero team known as Generation X, to whom Frost and Banshee becomes mentors at the reopened Massachusetts Academy. After Frost's {{business}} ventures take a bad turn, she seeks help from her estranged sister Adrienne, who is a psychometrist. Adrienne offers financial assistance but secretly plots against Frost and plants a bomb at the school, resulting in the death of Synch. Frost tracks down and kills Adrienne, but after returning to the Academy, grows increasingly distant from her students in an effort to hide her crime. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> learn what Frost did, the students become estranged from her, and Generation X disbands.|$|E

25|$|Latané and Darley {{performed}} three {{experiments to}} test bystander behavior in non-emergency situations Their {{results indicated that}} {{the way in which the}} subjects were asked for help mattered. In one condition, subjects asked a bystander for his or her name. More people gave an answer <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> gave their name first. In another condition, the students asked bystanders for a dime. When the student gave an explanation, such as saying that their wallet had been stolen, the percentage of people giving assistance was higher (72%) than when the student just asked for a dime (34%). Additional research by Faul, Mark, et al., using data collected by EMS officials when responding to an emergency, indicated that the response of bystanders was correlated with the health severity of the situation.|$|E
25|$|A site on Sullivan Street {{was most}} {{recently}} {{the home of}} the Foro Isabelino, but it hosted several artistic venues. In 1953, German artist Mathias Goeritz established here the experimental museum called “El Eco,” which was designed as a space “dedicated to emotional culture.) However, two years later the building was converted into a bar due to financial reasons. In the 1960s, it was reopened as the Centro Universitario de Teatro (CUT or University Center of Theatre). The building was demolished in 1967, and in its place, the Lope de Vega Hall, better known as the Foro Isabelino took over for the old CUT. In 1973, it became the site of a university student takeover, by non-theater students demanding space to realize their own productions. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> succeeded in their demands, they founded two theatrical companies that performed here. The building has since been catalogued as a heritage site by INBA, but theatrical operations were closed down in 1997. Today, the building is abandoned.|$|E

500|$|When Connor {{realized}} that the Birmingham jail was full, on May 3 he changed police tactics to keep protesters out of the downtown business area. Another thousand students gathered at the church and left to walk across Kelly Ingram Park while chanting, [...] "We're going to walk, walk, walk. Freedom... freedom... freedom." [...] As the demonstrators left the church, police warned them to stop and turn back, [...] "or you'll get wet". When they continued, Connor ordered the city's fire hoses, set {{at a level that}} would peel bark off a tree or separate bricks from mortar, to be turned on the children. Boys' shirts were ripped off, and young women were pushed over the tops of cars by the force of the water. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> crouched or fell, the blasts of water rolled them down the asphalt streets and concrete sidewalks. Connor allowed white spectators to push forward, shouting, [...] "Let those people come forward, sergeant. I want 'em to see the dogs work." ...|$|E
2500|$|Classical {{educators}} {{consider the}} Socratic method {{to be the}} best technique for teaching critical thinking. [...] In-class discussion and critiques are essential in order for students to recognize and internalize critical thinking techniques. [...] This method is widely used to teach both philosophy and law. [...] It is currently rare in other contexts. [...] Basically, the teacher referees the students' discussions, asks leading questions, and may refer to facts, but never gives a conclusion until at least one student reaches that conclusion. [...] The learning is most effective <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> compete strongly, even viciously in the argument, but always according to well-accepted rules of correct reasoning. [...] That is, fallacies should not be allowed by the teacher.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine a}} corpus of {{reflective}} tutorial dialogues between human tutor and <b>student</b> after <b>the</b> <b>student</b> completed introductory physics problems, to predict <b>when</b> <b>the</b> tutor abstracted from <b>the</b> <b>student’s</b> preceding turn or <b>when</b> <b>the</b> tutor specialized from <b>the</b> <b>student’s</b> preceding turn.

Tutor specialization occurs <b>when</b> <b>the</b> tutor repeats a segment of <b>the</b> <b>student’s</b> turn using more concrete terms. We find that features extracted from the reflective dialogue context produce the most predictive models. Also, the tutor abstracts more often <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> shows signs of working at a very detailed level for awhile, and prompts for specification <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>student’s</b> responses are imprecise. ...|$|R

[...] He later returned to Indonesia earlier than scheduled on 14 May, when violence in Jakarta reached its worst. The campus of Trisakti University in Grogol, West Jakarta, became the site of a gathering of 10,000 students on 12 May. They had planned on marching south toward the Parliament building, but security forces refused to allow them to leave the campus. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> conducted a sit-in outside the campus gates, shots broke out after rocks were allegedly thrown at police.
