25|$|On {{passenger}} cars, the CHMSL may {{be placed}} above the back glass, {{affixed to the}} vehicle's interior just inside the back glass, {{or it may be}} integrated into the vehicle's deck lid or into a spoiler. Other specialised fitments are sometimes seen; the Jeep Wrangler and Land Rover Freelander have the CHMSL on a stalk fixed to the spare <b>wheel</b> <b>carrier.</b> Trucks, vans and commercial vehicles sometimes have the CHMSL mounted to the trailing edge of the vehicle's roof. The CHMSL is required by regulations worldwide to be centred laterally on the vehicle, though UN Regulation 48 permits lateral offset of up to 15cm if the vehicle's lateral centre is not coincident with a fixed body panel, but instead separates movable components such as doors. The Renault Master and Ford Transit van, for example, uses a laterally offset CHMSL for this reason. The height of the CHMSL is also regulated, in absolute terms and with respect to the mounting height of the vehicle's conventional left and right stop lamps. Depending on the left and right lamps' height, the lower edge of the CHMSL may be just above the left and right lamps' upper edge.|$|E

Cooling air was designed to draw air in through the commander's and driver's hatches. This had the advantage of rapidly dispersing gun combustion gases when firing, but several disadvantages. The constant draft generated by the engine greatly affected the crew during cold weather, an engine fire would force the crew to evacuate and the engine noise and heat increased crew fatigue.

50|$|A {{radius rod}} (also called a radius arm or a torque arm) is a {{suspension}} link intended to control wheel {{motion in the}} longitudinal (fore-aft) direction. The link is connected (with a rubber or solid bushing) on {{one end to the}} <b>wheel</b> <b>carrier</b> or axle, on the other to the chassis or unibody of the vehicle. Radius rods are also sometimes used in aircraft with fixed (non retractable) undercarriages.|$|E
50|$|Compared to the {{production}} BMW E90 model, the axles and the suspension geometry has been changed significantly. The new axles design include a camber setting that could be adjusted independently of any other settings parameters, such as roll center and track.

On the 'closed' back models the nature of the rear bodywork meant the rear crossmember could be omitted for this purpose.|$|E

50|$|The {{official}} BMW Motorrad {{explanation of}} the duolever includes this:The advantage of this front wheel suspension on the motorcycle market at present is its torsional rigidity. The BMW Motorrad Duolever front wheel suspension is not influenced by negative forces {{in the same manner}} as a conventional telefork whose fixed and take-off tubes twist laterally as well as longitudinally during jounce/rebound and steering. Its two trailing links absorb the forces resulting from the jounce/rebound and keep the <b>wheel</b> <b>carrier</b> stable. Thus, any torsioning is excluded and the front wheel suspension is very precise. The steering commands of the rider are converted directly and the feedback from the front wheel is transparent in all driving conditions.A kinematical anti-dive effect is additionally achieved, just as for the Telelever, due to the arrangement of the trailing link bearings. While a conventional telefork during strong braking manoeuvres jounces heavily or locks, the Duolever still has sufficient spring travel remaining in this situation and therefore the rider can still brake into the corner extremely late yet directionally stable.|$|E

5000|$|The {{complete}} {{rear suspension}} assembly is {{carried in a}} steel crossbeam (shown ghosted in the diagram below), which {{is attached to the}} vehicle body via four rubber vee-blocks and also carries the differential (blue) and inboard brakes (red).

The lower link pivots adjacent to the differential casing at its inboard end and where it meets the <b>wheel</b> <b>carrier</b> at the wheel hub casting (violet) at its outboard end. The pivot bearings {{at each end of the}} lower link are widely spaced so as to provide maximum longitudinal rigidity. Suspension is provided by two coil spring and damper units (yellow) on each side of the differential casing (four in total), the spring and damper units attaching to the crossbeam at the top and the lower link at the bottom. The crossbeam is located by two radius arms (see photo above) each of which runs forward from the lower link to a point on the vehicle body and is pivoted at each end via rubber bushings.|$|E
