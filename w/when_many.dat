5|$|Sunday's {{popularity}} waned after World War I, <b>when</b> <b>many</b> {{people in}} his revival audiences were attracted to radio broadcasts and moving pictures instead.

5|$|A major {{turning point}} for the {{movement}} came during World War I, <b>when</b> <b>many</b> U.S. servicemen were diagnosed with venereal diseases. The government's response included an anti-venereal disease campaign that framed sexual intercourse and contraception as issues {{of public health and}} legitimate topics of scientific research. This was the first time a U.S. government institution had engaged in a sustained, public discussion of sexual matters; as a consequence, contraception transformed from an issue of morals to an issue of public health.|$|E

He continued his plans to colonise the east, even <b>when</b> <b>many</b> Germans were reluctant to relocate there, and despite negative effects on the war effort.|$|E
5|$|As a critic, Willis did {{not believe}} in {{including}} discussions of personalities of writers when reviewing their works. He also believed that, though publications should discuss political topics, they should not express party opinions or choose sides. The Mirror flourished at a time <b>when</b> <b>many</b> publications were discontinuing. Its success was due to the shrewd management of Willis and Morris and the two demonstrated that the American public could support literary endeavors. Willis was becoming an expert in American literature and so, in 1845, Willis and Morris issued an anthology, The Prose and Poetry of America.|$|E
5|$|By 1992, {{black metal}} scenes {{had begun to}} emerge in areas outside Scandinavia, {{including}} Germany, France, and Poland. The 1993 murder of Mayhem's Euronymous by Burzum's Varg Vikernes provoked intensive media coverage. Around 1996, <b>when</b> <b>many</b> in the scene felt the genre was stagnating, several key bands, including Burzum and Finland's Beherit, moved toward an ambient style, while symphonic black metal was explored by Sweden's Tiamat and Switzerland's Samael. In the late 1990s and early 2000s decade, Norway's Dimmu Borgir brought black metal closer to the mainstream, as did Cradle of Filth.|$|E

In 1784 a pair of women were arrested for stealing fans worth 15 shillings, meaning a conviction {{would result in the}} death penalty; Garrow convinced the jury to convict the women of stealing 4 shillings worth of fans, therefore changing the sentence to twelve months of hard labour.|$|E
5|$|Gillom {{played for}} the Massillon Tigers between 1938 and 1940, a period during which the team won all of its games and two High School Football National Championships. Gillom, who also played {{basketball}} and other sports, earned All-Ohio honors at Massillon {{and was one of}} several black players on the team at a time <b>when</b> <b>many</b> northern high schools excluded them. Brown's policy was to use his best players, regardless of race. Gillom set school records for points scored in a season and touchdown passes caught in a season. His record of 108 points in a season still stands.|$|E

The lack of audio dialog, which forced the player to read text for the story mode, was also a negative <b>when</b> <b>many</b> other games on the PS2 {{at the time were}} adding in voice overs. GamePro rated the overall sound a 3 out of 5. Other reviews rated the audio better, particularly the music and sound effects during the fights.|$|E

They are normally resident, but Pallas's sandgrouse can be locally migratory and very occasionally is irruptive, appearing in areas well outside its normal range. This happened in 1863 and 1888, and a major irruption took place in 1908 <b>when</b> <b>many</b> birds were seen as far afield as Ireland and the United Kingdom where they bred in Yorkshire and Moray.|$|E

After West won the election, he chose McNary to be special legal counsel to Oregon's railroad commission, who urged lower passenger and freight rates. Meanwhile, McNary maintained friendly relations with both progressive and conservative factions of the Oregon Republicans and with West.|$|E
5|$|The Yale Union Laundry Building {{was built}} to house a {{commercial}} laundry during an era, roughly 1900 to 1950, <b>when</b> <b>many</b> urban U.S. households sent out their laundry for cleaning rather than doing it at home.
