5|$|According to Lafcadio Hearn, a {{butterfly}} <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> Japan as {{the personification of}} a person's soul; whether they be living, dying, or already dead. One Japanese superstition says that if {{a butterfly}} enters your guest room and perches behind the bamboo screen, the person whom you most love is coming to see you. Large numbers of butterflies are viewed as bad omens. When Taira no Masakado was secretly preparing for his famous revolt, there appeared in Kyoto so vast a swarm of butterflies that the people were frightened— thinking the apparition to be a portent of coming evil.|$|E
30|$|Radiologic {{similarities}} may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> both diseases. Discrete, bilateral, symmetrical {{lymph node}} enlargement <b>is</b> usually <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> sarcoidosis. Fibrosis and military distribution although common <b>in</b> TB may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> both diseases. Both diseases show granulomatous inflammation on histopathology. Caseation <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> tuberculosis. Fibrinoid necrosis though rare {{can occur in}} up to 30 % of cases of sarcoidosis. There are no specific features enough to differentiate the two conditions with certainty, except a positive culture of MTb. A positive PCR for MTb may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the biopsy samples of sarcoidosis.|$|R

5|$|An early {{estimate}} by the Small Business Administration put total {{damage in}} Gilroy {{at twice the}} amount of what <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> Hollister. Ten people were brought to Hazel Hawkins Memorial Hospital in Hollister for treatment of lacerations, a cardiac problem, and anxiety. In Gilroy, the Wheeler Hospital saw six similar cases and a patient with a fractured hip. Most of those that sought care (including four that were transported by ambulance) were treated and released, but six were admitted.|$|E
5|$|Cordova-Buckley, {{who began}} {{appearing}} on the show during the third season, {{was surprised to find}} the writers' characterization of Rodriguez in the episode to closely mirror her own life. Cordova-Buckley stated that, like how Rodriguez is seen in the episode, she dislikes nightclubs, and has found herself changing over time to be a different person from who her old friends remember; for Cordova-Buckley, this <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> returning to Mexico after becoming an actor in the United States, which is reflected with Rodriguez's friends from Colombia from before she worked with S.H.I.E.L.D. as an Inhuman asset.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of {{the effect}} of the Reformation <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> early 1524. Candlemas was not celebrated, processions of robed clergy ceased, worshippers did not go with palms or relics on Palm Sunday to the Lindenhof, and triptychs {{remained}} covered and closed after Lent. Opposition to the changes came from Konrad Hofmann and his followers, but the council decided in favour of keeping the government mandates. When Hofmann left the city, opposition from pastors hostile to the Reformation broke down. The bishop of Constance tried to intervene in defending the mass and the veneration of images. Zwingli wrote an official response for the council and the result was the severance of all ties between the city and the diocese.|$|E

5|$|George Meyer {{obtained}} {{inspiration for}} the scene toward {{the beginning of the}} episode where Rainier Wolfcastle is taunting the children from an experience he had with Arnold Schwarzenegger. He was following Schwarzenegger during a hike, and overheard him taunting his children. Schwarzenegger's influence <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the same scene, as he was appointed to be the chairman of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, on which he served from 1990 to 1993.|$|E
5|$|In 1066, {{the comet}} <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> England and {{thought to be}} an omen: later that year Harold II of England died at the Battle of Hastings; {{it was a bad}} omen for Harold, but a good omen for the man who {{defeated}} him, William the Conqueror. The comet is represented on the Bayeux Tapestry and described in the tituli as a star. Surviving accounts from the period describe it as appearing to be four times the size of Venus and shining with a light equal to a quarter of that of the Moon. Halley came within 0.10AU of Earth at that time.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, a new registry, the Foundation Foxtrotter Heritage Association (FFHA), {{was formed}} {{with a goal}} of {{preserving}} and promoting the original heritage type of Fox Trotter that <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the first 20 years of the MFTHBA registry, in large part through {{reducing the amount of}} Tennessee Walking Horse blood. The Tennessee Walker did not figure prominently in original Missouri Fox Trotter pedigrees, and so the FFHA, by restricting the amount of Walker blood, is attempting to develop horses that more closely resemble the original Fox Trotter type.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the large fluctuations in Haumea's light curve due to the body's shape, which affect all colours equally, smaller independent colour variations seen in both visible and near-infrared wavelengths show a region on the surface that differs both in colour and in albedo. More specifically, a large dark red area on Haumea's bright white surface <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> September 2009, possibly an impact feature, which indicates an area rich in minerals and organic (carbon-rich) compounds, or possibly {{a higher proportion of}} crystalline ice. Thus Haumea may have a mottled surface reminiscent of Pluto, if not as extreme.|$|E
5|$|It <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> Figure2 that Foucault {{placed the}} {{rotating}} mirror R {{as close as}} possible to lens L so as to maximize the distance between R and the slit S. As R rotates, an enlarged image of slit S sweeps across the face of the distant mirror M. The greater the distance RM, the more quickly that the image sweeps across mirror M and the less light is reflected back. Foucault could not increase the RM distance in his folded optical arrangement beyond about 20meters without the image of the slit becoming too dim to accurately measure.|$|E

Reamon sold Michael on the school's proximity to family and friends, and Vick chose to attend Virginia Tech.

It was released on 26 January. Her next release was in Gali Gali Mein Chor Hai, from director Rumy Jafry, which began shooting in September 2011, and released on 3 February.
