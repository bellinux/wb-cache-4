5|$|In the {{particular}} {{version of the}} experiment shown here, Hoek used a prism P to disperse light from a slit into a spectrum which passed through a collimator C before entering the apparatus. With the apparatus oriented parallel to the hypothetical aether wind, Hoek expected the light in one circuit to be retarded 7/600mm {{with respect to the}} other. <b>Where</b> <b>this</b> retardation represented an integral number of wavelengths, he expected to see constructive interference; <b>where</b> <b>this</b> retardation represented a half-integral number of wavelengths, he expected to see destructive interference. In the absence of dragging, his expectation was for the observed spectrum to be continuous with the apparatus oriented transversely to the aether wind, and to be banded with the apparatus oriented parallel to the aether wind. His actual experimental results were completely negative.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} {{blacktip reef shark}} (C. melanopterus) and the whitetip reef shark (Triaenodon obesus), the grey reef shark {{is one of the}} three most common sharks inhabiting Indo-Pacific reefs. They {{actively}} expel most other shark species from favored habitats, even species larger in size. In areas <b>where</b> <b>this</b> species co-exists with the blacktip reef shark, the latter species occupies the shallow flats, while the former stays in deeper water. Areas with a high abundance of grey reef sharks tend to contain few sandbar sharks (C. plumbeus), and vice versa; {{this may be due to}} their similar diets causing competitive exclusion.|$|E

5|$|Eleven {{percent of}} Nescopeck Creek's {{watershed}} {{is made up}} of the Udorthents-Urban Land-Volusia series. There is some urban development over lands containing the soil series. Other areas <b>where</b> <b>this</b> soil series occurs have been surface-mined. The limiting factor for plant growth in this series is the rocky surface and the depth of the bedrock below. The Udorthents-Urban Land-Volusia soil series occurs in the southeastern and parts of the southwestern parts of the Nescopeck Creek watershed. The Lackawanna-Arnot-Morris series is present in nine percent of Nescopeck Creek's watershed. The Lackawanna-Arnot-Morris soil series mostly is near Nescopeck Creek's source, but there is some of it in the central Nescopeck Creek watershed.|$|E

5|$|In Half-Life, players usually fight {{alone and}} only {{occasionally}} encounter friendly non-player characters who assist them, such as security guards and scientists. While Decay still features levels <b>where</b> <b>this</b> is the case, significant sections in Decay {{are dedicated to}} working with friendly non-player characters, usually escorting them to various objectives and protecting them in firefights. An array of enemy characters from Half-Life populate the game, including alien lifeforms such as headcrabs and Vortigaunts, as well as human soldiers sent in to contain the alien threat. The players {{have access to a}} limited selection of Half-Lifes weaponry to assist them in the game. Although developed after Opposing Force, no non-player characters or weapons from the earlier expansion appear in Decay.|$|E
5|$|Lithium amides {{like the}} diisopropylamide (LDA) and the (tetramethylpiperidide (LiTMP)) {{generally}} {{work well for}} the deprotonation {{of all types of}} salts, providing that not too much LiOH is present in the n-butyllithium used to make the lithium amide. Titration of lithium amide can be used to determine the amount of hydroxide in solution. The deprotonation of precursor salts with metal hexamethyldisilazides works very cleanly for the deprotonation of all types of salts, except for unhindered formamidinium salts, <b>where</b> <b>this</b> base can act as a nucleophile to give a triaminomethane adduct.|$|E
5|$|Numbers have {{declined}} {{in recent decades}} in Europe, although Bulgaria, Greece and Cyprus still have several thousand breeding pairs. Turkey is a stronghold with up to 90,000 pairs. The species is declining in Greece and Turkey because of habitat loss, and a large decrease in Israel {{is thought to be}} due to pesticides. In Somalia this bird is now rare. Migrating birds are shot in the countries around the eastern Mediterranean, despite legal protection in most countries, and there is some persecution of breeding birds in Greece and Syria, <b>where</b> <b>this</b> species is considered to be unlucky. There are indications that this shrike is adapting to plantations instead of natural woodlands, which could help populations in the longer term.|$|E

The study recommended that the United States adopt the International System of units, and in 1975 Congress passed the Metric Conversion Act of 1975, which established a national policy of coordinating and planning for the increased use of the metric measurement system in the United States. Metrication was voluntary and to be coordinated by the United States Metric Board (USMB).|$|E
5|$|Outside {{their native}} range, escaped birds {{frequently}} establish themselves {{in areas with}} a suitable climate and can then colonize new areas nearby. Escaped cage-birds established in the wild and such populations have been recorded in the West Indies (Puerto Rico since 1971), Hawaii (since 1883), Australia, Japan and southern United States mainly in Florida and California. In Oahu, Hawaii, they compete for habitats with the tricolored munia and tend to be rare <b>where</b> <b>this</b> competitor is present.|$|E
5|$|Recently it {{has been}} {{questioned}} whether a royal affinity could actually {{work in the same}} way as a noble one. It has been suggested that since the king had to be a lord to his retainers and provide good lordship, but also king to the entire people, a contradiction existed, resulting in a decline in local stability <b>where</b> <b>this</b> occurred. At the same time, even powerful magnates such as Gaunt could cause local dissatisfaction by retaining some and, inevitably, excluding others. On the other hand, it has also been pointed out how, particularly for kings, recruitment into the affinity was a clear promotion which could act as an encouraging loyalty or offered a political amnesty.|$|E
