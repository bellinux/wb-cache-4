2500|$|The process languished until 1867, when Harvey J. Harwood of Utica, New York filed {{a patent}} for the {{cold-rolling}} of threads on <b>wood</b> <b>screws.</b> [...] Further efforts to cold-roll threads on screws followed, but none seemed {{to meet with}} much success until Hayward Augustus Harvey (1824-1893) of Orange, N.J. filed his patents of 1880 and 1881. [...] Charles D. Rogers of the American Screw Co. of Providence, Rhode Island made further refinements {{to the process of}} rolling threads onto screws.|$|E

2500|$|First {{issued in}} 1943, the M1 uses a simple {{blowback}} operation, with the charging handle {{moved to the}} side. The flip-up adjustable Lyman rear sight was replaced with a fixed L sight. Late M1s had triangular guard wings added to the rear L sight, which were standardized on the M1A1. The slots adjoining the magazine well allowing {{the use of a}} drum magazine were removed. A new magazine catch with the provision for retaining drum magazines removed, was produced, but most M1s and later M1A1s retained the original. The less expensive and more-easily manufactured [...] "stick" [...] magazines were used exclusively in the M1, with a new 30-round version joining the familiar 20-round type. The Cutts compensator, barrel cooling fins, and Blish lock were omitted while the buttstock was permanently affixed. Late production M1 stocks were fitted with reinforcing bolts and washers to prevent splitting of the stock where it attached to the receiver. The British had used improvised bolts or <b>wood</b> <b>screws</b> to reinforce M1928 stocks. The M1 reinforcing bolt and washer were carried over to the M1A1 and retrofitted to many of the M1928A1s in U.S. and British service. Late M1s also had simplified fire control switches, also carried over to the M1A1.|$|E

50|$|When a screw {{is driven}} without a pilot hole, or with too small a pilot hole, {{the core of}} the screw may bind and lead to the screw being broken. The {{appropriate}} pilot hole will prevent binding while providing sufficient friction to keep the screw from loosening. For common <b>wood</b> <b>screws,</b> the pilot providing clearance for {{the core of the}} screw may be followed by a larger bit to shallower depth to provide clearance for the larger, unthreaded shank of the screw. For standard <b>wood</b> <b>screws,</b> special pilot drill bits are manufactured to produce the correct hole profile in a single operation, rather than needing several different drill bit sizes and depths.|$|E

50|$|Where a {{fastener}} forms its own thread in the component being fastened, {{it is called}} a screw.

50|$|The first {{production}} run rifles had a 33-inch barrel. Early models had {{the bottom of}} the octagon portion of the barrel rounded.

50|$|Today {{the threads}} of {{threaded}} fasteners (such as machine screws, <b>wood</b> <b>screws,</b> wallboard screws, and sheetmetal screws) {{are usually not}} cut via single-point screw-cutting; instead most are generated by other, faster processes, such as thread forming and rolling and cutting with die heads. The latter processes are the ones employed in modern screw machines. These machines, although they are lathes specialized for making screws, are not screw-cutting lathes {{in the sense of}} employing single-point screw-cutting.|$|E
50|$|Lag screws (US) or {{coach screws}} (UK, Australia, and New Zealand) (also {{referred}} to as lag bolts or coach bolts, although this is a misnomer) are large <b>wood</b> <b>screws.</b> Square-headed and hex-headed lag screws are covered by ASME B18.2.1 standards, and the head is typically an external hex. A typical lag screw can range in diameter from 1/4 in to 1+1/4 in, and lengths from 1/4 to 6 in or longer, with the coarse threads of a wood-screw or sheet-metal-screw threadform (but larger).|$|E
50|$|Six {{hardened}} steel <b>wood</b> <b>screws</b> passing through slightly oversize holes {{just in front}} of the pivot point stopped the bridge from being pulled towards the neck end of the guitar. The upper portion of the screws is smooth, not threaded. These six screws are often mistakenly assumed to be the pivot point rather than the hidden knife edge. This design works, in spite of the friction caused by the edges of the six holes sliding up and down the screw shafts when vibrato is applied.|$|E
