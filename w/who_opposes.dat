5|$|Even liberal {{senators}} were agitated by {{the proposed}} changes, fearing their own lands would be confiscated. Senators arranged for other tribunes {{to oppose the}} reforms.

The senators were left with only one constitutional response – to threaten prosecution after Tiberius's term as a tribune ended. This necessitated Tiberius to stand for a second term.|$|E

5|$|Traveling to {{the ruined}} city of Paddra in 10 AF, they find Hope, {{who has become}} {{the leader of the}} Academy, with Alyssa as his assistant. They also find a {{recording}} of prophecies made by one of the seeresses of Paddra, who are believed to have died out centuries prior: one fragmented prophecy shows Lightning in Valhalla. Paddra is shrouded by an eclipse, which Noel says is not supposed to happen for several centuries. While Serah and Noel resolve the paradox causing the eclipse, they encounter Caius Ballad, a man Noel knows from 700 AF <b>who</b> <b>opposes</b> their mission, and Yeul, who looks identical to a girl of the same name Noel knew in the future. After resolving the paradox, an alternative timeline appears in which there was never an eclipse. The repaired prophecy shows Caius in Valhalla fighting Lightning and the pillar supporting Cocoon collapsing. Noel claims that this takes place around 400 AF, devastating the human population as well as the world, creating a future where he is the last human in existence. Serah and Noel move on, while Hope and Alyssa work on finding a way to prevent the pillar's collapse.|$|E
