5|$|In June 1933, Patriarch Shimun XXIII Eshai {{was invited}} to Baghdad for {{negotiations}} with Hikmat Sulayman's government and was detained there after refusing to relinquish temporal authority. He <b>would</b> <b>eventually</b> <b>be</b> exiled to Cyprus.|$|E
5|$|Munroe {{announced}} in March, 2014 {{that he had}} signed a deal with publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt to compile {{a large number of}} his What If? entries into a book. What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions <b>would</b> <b>eventually</b> <b>be</b> released in September that year.|$|E
5|$|After the Great Depression, the {{building}} housed {{a succession of}} tenants, including barber shops and cafés. The building changed hands many times and was scheduled for demolition on several occasions, but escaped this fate apparently because {{a sufficient number of}} local residents came to its defense. It was eventually deeded to the city of Wichita Falls. As {{the building}} continued to deteriorate, in 1986 the city gave the building to the Wichita County Heritage Society (WCHS), with the hope that it <b>would</b> <b>eventually</b> <b>be</b> restored, making it a viable part of the Depot Square Historic District.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{commercial}} and critical failure of Pinkerton (1996), Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo placed the band on hiatus. He returned to Harvard University to finish his studies, but eventually dropped out to focus on songwriting. During this time, Cuomo played with a different group of musicians in the band Homie, based in Boston. One {{of the members of}} Homie was Mikey Welsh, a bass player who <b>would</b> <b>eventually</b> <b>be</b> asked to replace Matt Sharp in Weezer.|$|E
5|$|His The Method of Sociology first {{introduced}} {{his concept of}} divisions within subfields of sociology. His most notable works included two books published {{in the same year}} (1952): Modern Nationalities, and Cultural Sciences. The former is an analysis of the evolution of national-culture societies, and the latter presents a theoretical study of the relation between sociology and other sciences. Znaniecki never finished his magnum opus, Systematic Sociology, which <b>would</b> <b>eventually</b> <b>be</b> collected and published posthumously in its unfinished but final form as Social Relations and Social Roles: The Unfinished Systematic Sociology (1965).|$|E
5|$|In 1926, a {{delegation}} of Supreme Council officers met with President Calvin Coolidge to share with him their concerns about the persecution of Catholics in Mexico during its revolution, which had considered the Church part of a corrupt establishment to be overthrown. The Order subsequently launched a $1 million campaign to educate Americans about the attacks on Catholics and the Church in the Cristero War. Twenty-five martyrs from the conflict <b>would</b> <b>eventually</b> <b>be</b> canonized, including six knights.|$|E

50|$|What <b>would</b> <b>eventually</b> become Rochester <b>was</b> {{originally}} a Lenape village called Sawcunk before being settled in 1799 {{in what was}} then the American frontier by white settlers. During this time, what <b>would</b> <b>eventually</b> become Rochester <b>was</b> known as East Bridgewater, Fairport, and Beaver Point. The borough adopted its current name in 1834 when a local businessman who did regular business in Pittsburgh decided to christen his home with the name Rochester so he could have a unique name to stamp his goods; the borough would officially be incorporated as such in 1849.|$|R
50|$|Pre-existing pager {{numbers were}} already {{scattered}} under various codes in the 02xx to 09xx range and had 9 digits. Several services used non-standard 01 numbers. These <b>would</b> all <b>eventually</b> <b>be</b> moved to 076 codes and to 10 digits in the Big Number Change in 2000.|$|R
5|$|Porting Final Fantasy XI to the Xbox proved {{difficult}} due to compatibility issues {{greater than}} was hoped for between Xbox Live and PlayOnline, likely because {{the latter was}} designed first. After negotiation, Xbox 360 players were able {{to play the game}} through PlayOnline's servers exclusively, despite Microsoft's initial wish that Square Enix would use its own platform. Downloadable content was also not available on the platform since the game played through PlayOnline. It was hoped that content <b>would</b> <b>eventually</b> <b>be</b> offered through the Xbox Live Marketplace. Final Fantasy XII started out as a game designed for the PlayOnline game platform.|$|E
5|$|The British Commandos {{were formed}} during the Second World War in June 1940, {{following}} {{a request from}} the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill, for a force that could carry out raids against German-occupied Europe. Initially drawn from within the British Army from soldiers who volunteered for the Special Service Brigade, the Commandos' ranks <b>would</b> <b>eventually</b> <b>be</b> filled by members of all branches of the British Armed Forces {{and a number of}} foreign volunteers from German-occupied countries.|$|E
5|$|The priory was {{elevated}} {{to the status}} of abbey by Pope Leo XIII in 1894, and the monks founded a school for lay monks to help build a self-sustaining source of revenue. Failing to attract a single prospective applicant in over seven years, they expanded enrollment to students with no intention of joining the clergy. The two groups <b>would</b> <b>eventually</b> <b>be</b> taught separately, and the monastic students were trained to become priests fluent in Bohemian, German, and English and prepared to preach to ethnically diverse congregations. Lay students were trained for employment in the business world.|$|E

50|$|Roy Boulting said he {{intended}} to start filming in August 1963 at Shepperton Studios with four weeks location filming in West Africa. The budget of $1 million was to be provided by Bryanston Films and British Lion. However the film <b>would</b> <b>eventually</b> instead <b>be</b> made by John Guillermin and 20th Century Fox.|$|R
50|$|The {{result was}} a system of five vowels, a, e, i, o, u. These would {{subsequently}} split, according to their environment, into long, short, and (eventually) unstressed variants; and these variants <b>would</b> <b>eventually</b> also <b>be</b> altered based on neighboring sounds. However, in phonemic terms, A-L still has only five vowels, with multiple allophones.|$|R
5|$|With {{the land}} secured, the campus was {{designed}} {{in a way}} to ensure the maximum collaboration between the different sciences, with buildings laid along radial streets emanating from a central circular plaza, which also hosted administrative buildings. The layout of the campus <b>would</b> <b>eventually</b> <b>be</b> used on the design of the university's logo, created by Max Schiefer, which is essentially a simplified map of the core circle of the campus. This design is similar to the University of California, Irvine campus, build around the same time.|$|E
5|$|After Spare's death, Grant {{began to}} focus more on his own writing career. From 1959 to 1963, Grant privately {{published}} the Carfax Monographs, a series of short articles on magic published in ten installments, each at a limited print run of 100. Nine of these volumes included original artworks produced by Steffi, reflecting the increasing collaboration between husband and wife which would be reflected in many of Grant's subsequent publications. The Carfax Monographs <b>would</b> <b>eventually</b> <b>be</b> assembled together and re-released as Hidden Lore in 1989. In 1966 he also privately published a small book of his poems, Black to Black and Other Poems. During the 1950s and 1960s Spare also authored a number of novels, although these would only be published by Starfire Publishing between 1997 and 2012.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} {{broadcasts}} of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and the Voice of America to Central and Eastern Europe, a major propaganda effort begun in 1949 was Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, dedicated to bringing about the peaceful {{demise of the}} communist system in the Eastern Bloc. Radio Free Europe attempted to achieve these goals by serving as a surrogate home radio station, {{an alternative to the}} controlled and party-dominated domestic press. Radio Free Europe was a product {{of some of the most}} prominent architects of America's early Cold War strategy, especially those who believed that the Cold War <b>would</b> <b>eventually</b> <b>be</b> fought by political rather than military means, such as George F. Kennan.|$|E

50|$|In 2006, Genentech {{announced}} plans to locate a packaging and distribution facility on 100 acre in Hillsboro. The $400 million facility opened in 2010, which Oregon officials hoped <b>would</b> <b>eventually</b> also <b>be</b> used {{for research and development}} for the biotechnology company. Other biotech or medical companies based in Hillsboro include FEI Company and Acumed.|$|R
5|$|Although {{it gained}} recruits, the rising began {{to suffer from}} {{internal}} divisions, particularly between the Highlanders who made {{up the bulk of}} the forces and the Lowland nobles and officers who were their commanders. In early 1654, nine months into the revolt, Middleton, a Lowland officer and a veteran of the Battle of Worcester, arrived with a commission to command from Charles II. Despite objections from his followers, Glencairn surrendered control over his forces, which had now reached 3,500 foot and 1,500 horse. That evening Sir George Munro, Middleton's aide insulted Glencairn's forces and the result was a duel in which Munro was wounded. Glencairn was arrested. He <b>would</b> <b>eventually</b> <b>be</b> released and retire from the conflict. A series of other disputes and duels undermined the leadership of the campaign {{for the remainder of the}} rising.|$|E
5|$|By this time, {{the first}} wave of what <b>would</b> <b>eventually</b> <b>be</b> more than four million letters, telegrams, postcards, and phone calls had flooded into RNC {{headquarters}} and other political offices. While a later study found that only about 7 percent of these communications addressed any substantive issue, they still ran 75 to one in favor of Nixon. Nixon skeptics joined in; both Stassen and Dewey sent congratulatory telegrams. Many letters included contributions {{to help pay for the}} cost of the broadcast; the RNC eventually recouped four-fifths of the $75,000 cost. Newspaper switchboards were jammed with calls from people seeking the RNC's address, while Western Union was caught off guard by Nixon's request that listeners wire the RNC, and had no extra help on hand. Checkers herself received enough dog food to last a year, and hundreds of collars, leashes, and toys.|$|E
5|$|During 1944, Allied {{submarine}} attacks effectively cut off {{the supply}} of oil from Southeast Asia to Japan and greatly reduced Japanese imports of other commodities. By {{this stage of the}} war, the oil reserves in Japan had been largely depleted. U.S.Navy submarines sank many Japanese warships during 1944, including the battleship , seven aircraft carriers, two heavy and seven light cruisers. In early 1945, the Japanese Government assessed that all convoy routes from the south <b>would</b> <b>eventually</b> <b>be</b> cut, and attempted to supplement the supplies of oil brought in by tankers by loading drums of oil on freighters. Several IJN aircraft carriers were also used to transport drums of oil from Singapore to Japan.|$|E

5|$|Each team is {{assigned}} one pick per round with the order based generally {{on the reverse}} order of finish in the previous season with {{the team with the}} worst record receiving the first draft slot. Exceptions to this are the Super Bowl participants from the previous season — the champion Baltimore Ravens were assigned the final draft slot and the runner-up New York Giants assigned the 30th slot in each round. The draft was broadcast on ESPN and ESPN2. Due to previous trades, the Dallas Cowboys and Tennessee Titans did not have selections in the first round. More than half of the players selected in the draft's first round (17 of 31) <b>would</b> <b>eventually</b> <b>be</b> elected to at least one Pro Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Failure usually meant {{six more}} months of sea service before the {{examination}} could again be attempted. Some men never passed it. Successful completion made the midshipman a 'passed midshipman'. From the 18th century {{until the second}} half of the 19th century, a midshipman in the Royal Navy who passed the lieutenant's examination did not automatically receive a commission. Midshipmen with political connections were promoted first, while others would wait their turn on a roster. During wartime, when large numbers of ships and men might be lost in battle, most passed midshipman would be promoted in a year or two, but during peacetime the wait might be so long that the midshipman <b>would</b> <b>eventually</b> <b>be</b> considered too old and lose his chance for a commission.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, {{plans for}} {{expansion}} of Turf Moor were {{released to the}} public. The Burnley directors proposed a major development of the stadium, costing £20 million. The plans, which would incorporate the rebuilding of the Cricket Field Stand and the moving of the players' entrance tunnel, {{have been put on}} hold until the current financial climate improves. In 2009, following Burnley's promotion to the Premier League, the development of a second tier on the Bob Lord stand was announced. Director Paul Fletcher stated that the anticipated capacity of Turf Moor <b>would</b> <b>eventually</b> <b>be</b> 28,000 to cope with extra fans. However following the club's relegation from the Premier League in 2010, these plans were put on hold indefinitely.|$|E
40|$|The {{benefits}} from green payments for {{the adoption of}} a conservation technology or practice are reduced if the technology <b>would</b> have <b>eventually</b> <b>been</b> adopted regardless of the green payment.
