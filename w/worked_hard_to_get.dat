5|$|Later in April, {{the team}} took two wins at two {{concurrent}} events. In stage 2 at the Presidential Cycling Tour of Turkey, Valentin {{took his first}} win {{of the season in}} a field sprint, besting Alessandro Petacchi at the finish. The victory made the younger Iglinsky the race leader for a day before he ceded it to 's Manuel Belletti, winner of stage 3. Later in the race, Zeits made a fortunate breakaway which took nearly 12 minutes over the rest of the peloton. The result put him fourth in the overall standings, 20 seconds clear of the man in fifth, but 10 minutes ahead of the man in sixth. The next day, the Astana squad <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> another breakaway containing Zeits to the finish line first, which resulted him in moving up to second overall. He retained this position to the conclusion of the race. At the Tour de Romandie, Vinokourov won stage 3. He, Mickaël Cherel, and Tony Martin had slipped off the front of the field when the day's principal breakaway was caught, and stayed away to allow a three-up sprint decide the winner, though they had no appreciable time gap over the fast-charging peloton at the finish. Cherel protested the results, feeling that Vinokourov's sprint had illegally impeded him, but race officials upheld the order of finish on the road. Vinokourov felt after this result that he was a strong contender for the overall crown, sitting 32 seconds back with an individual time trial, where pending race leader Pavel Brutt struggles, still to race. He finished the race third, losing time to race champion Cadel Evans in that time trial. He later said he was satisfied with this performance. However, at this race, Kiserlovski was revealed to have worse injuries from his Paris–Nice crash than first thought. An MRI taken after the Romandie prologue, due to the Croatian suffering from severe shoulder pain, revealed that he had a cracked vertebra. He abandoned the race with hopes of recovering in time for the Giro d'Italia. Vinokourov had a successful Critérium du Dauphiné. He finished second in the prologue time trial and assumed the race lead the next day on the first road race stage. He held the jersey for a second day before losing it in the stage 3 time trial, a considerably longer course than the prologue. He finished a distant 14th, having difficulty on the technical descents on the course, and slipped to fourth overall. When Janez Brajkovič faltered in stage 6, Vinokourov re-assumed a podium position, third, and kept it to the race's conclusion the next day.|$|E
500|$|Morrissey's {{next major}} leading role was as Member of Parliament (MP) Stephen Collins in Paul Abbott's BBC serial State of Play (2003). Morrissey {{received}} the scripts {{for the first}} three episodes and was keen to read the last three. They had not been completed when he originally requested them but Abbott told him how Collins' story concludes. Unsure how to approach the role, Morrissey was advised by his friend, director Paul Greengrass, to get Collins' job as politician right. Morrissey contacted State of Play producer Hilary Bevan Jones, who set up meetings between Morrissey and select committee members Kevin Barron and Fabian Hamilton. Both politicians educated Morrissey on {{how difficult it is to}} commute to London from a constituency outside the capital. Morrissey was also able to shadow Peter Mandelson around the House of Commons for a fortnight. He questioned Mandelson about his job as a cabinet minister but did not ask about his personal life. Mandelson told him about how politics can quickly [...] "seduce" [...] MPs who have <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into Parliament.|$|E

Following the release of Can't Be Tamed, Cyrus officially parted ways with longtime record label Hollywood Records. With Hannah Montana now officially over, Cyrus announced that she planned to take a hiatus from music to focus on her film career. She commented, [...] "I've not taken, like, acting lessons or anything, but it doesn't mean I don't need to because I'm sure I do... I'm probably going to go book an acting coach." [...] She later confirmed {{she would not be}} going to college for the time being, stating that [...] " [...] a firm believer that you can go back at any age you want", and that she [...] " [...] <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to where [...] now, and [...] to enjoy it while it lasts".|$|E

Hence, when Sae managed to get into Waseda University, Kouhei at first refused to see her off.

In 1931 she {{approached}} the Manhattan Local Musicians Union for membership, but was refused, as they would not recognize the ukulele as a musical instrument. [...] In the refusal the representative {{told her that the}} ukulele was considered a [...] "fun toy which isn't allowed in orchestras, and anyone can make a noise on it {{in a matter of days}} ... it was simply a novelty contraption...". [...] While the union relented and allowed that the ukulele was an instrument, they would not accept ability with it as qualification for membership. They refused for many years, but eventually, under her constant pressure with the support of such notable players as Cliff Edwards and Arthur Godfrey, the individual chapters relented.|$|E

In February he {{signed a contract with}} Philips Records and recorded his first 78 rpm record, [...] "Il Y A", which was released in March. The talent scout and artistic director at the record company, Jacques Canetti, invited him to move to Paris. Despite his family's objections and the added pressure of raising a second daughter, France, born on 12 July, he left Brussels for Paris in the autumn of 1953. In Paris Brel <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> his career off the ground. He stayed at the Hotel Stevens and gave guitar lessons to artist-dancer Francesco Frediani to pay his rent. He found work on the cabaret circuit at venues such as L'Écluse, L'Échelle de Jacob, and in Jacques Canetti's cabaret Les Trois Baudets.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Indian Express, {{soon after}} its {{inception}} in May 1999 the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rid of its [...] "Kunbi Only" [...] image. Sharad Pawar found, after breaking away from the Congress, {{that it was not}} possible to win elections with just the Kunbi vote. In order to attract the non-Kunbi OBC vote, estimated to form 40% of the electorate, Pawar recruited Chhagan Bhujbal (a Mali), and Pandurang Hajare (a Teli). Even though Pawar recruited other Telis like Pandurang Dhole, the Indian Express wondered if it would be enough to counter the age-old and keen Kunbi versus Teli rivalry. A closer look at local and regional leaders in the NCP revealed that almost all of them belonged to the Kunbi community. In 2009, the NCP president Sharad Pawar chose Anil Deshmukh over Rajendra Shingane as party candidate from the Vidharbha region because he represented the huge Kunbi-Marathi community there.|$|E
2500|$|Van Gasteren <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> an {{interview}} with Meher Baba for Nema aviona za Zagreb. In 1967 Meher Baba was {{near the end of}} his life and in strict seclusion. Through the help of numerous contacts with people he met in his travels who had met Baba in the 60s, including Irwin Luck, Rick Chapman, and Robert Dreyfuss, Van Gasteren was at last able to reach Baba's secretary and arrange a meeting. Van Gasteren told Baba, [...] "The appearance of the Avatar in my film is more than functional, it is necessary, to give all the other happenings and sequences the final and right dimension." [...] The terms were that the shooting could only take place on September 20, 1967, during a short period when Baba would be coming out of seclusion for three hours in order to wash the feet of seven lepers, the last of such an occasion in Baba's life. Van Gasteren was told that if he was there on time, he could film and interview Baba. Van Gasteren arrived in Bombay on September 17, and at Meherazad at precisely 9:00 A.M. on September 19, accompanied by cameraman Jan de Bont and soundman Peter Brugman, and was shown around the location in preparation for the following day's shoot and met Baba. The following day, September 20, the crew filmed forty minutes of film footage of Baba and the surrounding area, including the interview seen in the film.|$|E

The next turn was The Baxter Brothers, who ran up and down each other's backs and up and down each other's front, and stood on each other's heads and on their own heads, and perched for a moment on each other's shoulders, as if each of them was a flight of stairs with a landing, and the three of them were three flights, three storeys up, the top flight continually running down and becoming the bottom flight, while the middle flight collapsed and became a horizontal corridor.|$|E
