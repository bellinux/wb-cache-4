25|$|Born in 1939 in Vietnam, Raymond Belle {{was the son}} of a French {{physician}} and Vietnamese mother. During the First Indochina War, his father died and he was separated from his mother, after which he was sent to a military orphanage in Da Lat at the age of 7. He took it upon himself to train harder and longer than everyone else in order to never be a victim. At night, <b>when</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> was asleep, he would be outside running or climbing trees. He would use the military obstacle courses in secret, and also created courses of his own that tested his endurance, strength, and flexibility. Doing this enabled him not only to survive the hardships he experienced during his childhood, but also eventually to thrive. After the Battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954, he returned to France and remained in military education until the age of 19, when he joined the Paris Fire Brigade, a French Army unit.|$|E
5000|$|Corthron {{attended}} the University of Maryland for an undergraduate degree in communications and film. Even {{though she had}} been writing for years, {{it was not until}} the last semester of her senior year that she first turned on to writing plays. During a creative writing class, Corthon was assigned a group project of creating a play. She worked on the play for the entire semester, revising and reworking the text, which concluded in a final performance. The plot dealt with a returning Vietnam veteran and his sister, but the success of the short piece was not the plot, it was the impact the play had on the classroom audience. She told the Theater Development Fund's periodical, Sightlines, [...] "When it came time to do scenes from our plays, I was embarrassed when mine lasted 30 minutes <b>when</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else's</b> was only five (they were all supposed to be five), but I was soon gratified when the lights came up and I saw how my writing affected the other students." ...|$|R
50|$|Another moral theory using a {{universal}} practice test is rule consequentialism, {{or more precisely}} that version of it sometimes called ideal rule consequentialism, where a moral rule is permissible {{if and only if}} its practice by all persons would produce at least as much of a balance of good over bad results than the universal practice of any other rule would. This theory was first suggested as an amendment to more standard form of consequentialism by R.F. Harrod in 1936, on the grounds that some behaviors cause more harm <b>when</b> <b>everyone</b> (or almost <b>everyone)</b> <b>else</b> is doing the same thing than in the more common case where not <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> is doing so; since the harm can get so very bad in such cases, he argued that we should use its effects in this universal practice case to condemn the same behavior even when almost no one else is doing it, and even when it actually causes little or no harm in such cases. He illustrated this with Kant's example of telling a lie, arguing that the practice of lying by many individual people may actually only be modestly harmful, and sometimes may produce more good in individual cases, as long as enough truth-tellers are still around to provide a moral example and allows us to have some confidence that we will be told the truth (and be believed when we speak) when we would like this; but the effect of even those last few hold-outs for truth-telling switching their behavior so as to also lie is more devastating than that of a few lies told <b>when</b> not <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> is doing so.|$|R

500|$|In {{reference}} to the 1978 kung fu film The 36th Chamber of Shaolin that the group enjoyed watching, the Clan considered themselves as lyrical masters of the 36 chambers, and arrived onto the rap scene while appearing to be ahead, and more advanced over others, with [...] "knowledge of 36 chambers of hip hop music <b>when</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> in hip hop was striving to attain the knowledge of 35 lessons." [...] Also, while the human body has 108 pressure points (1 + 0 + 8 = 9), only the Wu-Tang martial artists learned and understood that 36 of those pressure points are deadly (9 + 36 = 45) (4 + 5 = 9) The lyrics and rhymes of the 9 members are to be considered as 36 deadly lyrical techniques for pressure points. All {{of this is the}} basis for the album title, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers), being that 9 members x 4 chambers = 36. However, this is just a theory; the true significance of the title is not definitively known.|$|E
500|$|The xx started {{recording}} Coexist in November 2011, {{and used}} a photography studio in North London to record the songs they had put together. They later used the rehearsal space in East London to practice playing the songs live. They recorded for six months in London and intended to finish before their scheduled music festival appearances for 2012. The xx's direction for the album was partly inspired by the electronic dance scene that occurred while they toured for their first album, {{as well as the}} live DJ sets of Smith, who was mostly listening to dark Chicago house music at the time. According to him, [...] "We left [...] when we were 17 and we missed out on that chunk of our lives <b>when</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> was partying." [...] However, he insisted that [...] "we're not looking to make people dance." [...] They were also influenced by pop-reggae band UB40, folk act White Hinterland, and neo soul artist Van Hunt, all of whom they listened to while recording Coexist.

5000|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} over {{five months in}} 1983 at Castlesound Studios, which Malcolm had set up in 1979 in the former primary school building {{in the village of}} Pencaitland, 12 mi east of Edinburgh. Living first in a rented flat in Edinburgh, and then later sleeping on Malcolm's floor when their money ran out, the band laboured over the album because all the sounds on the record had to be created and played physically, as it was made in the days before samplers existed. The band also had exacting standards and obsessed about every detail on the album: Malcolm recalled that [...] "they were always particularly sensitive to not doing the wrong thing and making sure it had absolutely the right emotional impact: there were times <b>when</b> I'm sure <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> felt something was done and then someone would throw a spanner in the works over some little thing".|$|R

[...] Renault dismissed suggestions that Alonso had brake tested Hamilton in the incident that led to the McLaren's wing breaking off. Pat Symonds, Renault's head of engineering, said his team's telemetry indicated Alonso was on full throttle down the straight, and had not touched the brakes: [...] "I think all I can say from our side {{is that there is no}} blame attributable to Fernando, which is what some of the speculation might be." [...] McLaren F1 CEO Martin Whitmarsh said that Hamilton's front wing had broken seconds before the impact, and that the resulting downforce reduction had sucked Hamilton into Alonso's slipstream faster than expected. However, photos indicate that the front wing on the McLaren could have broken even earlier when Hamilton nudged a car (believed to be Alonso) on the opening lap. The later incident left Alonso with damage to the back of the car, impairing his attempts to pass Glock late in the race.|$|E
