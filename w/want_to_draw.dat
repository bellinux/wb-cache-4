25|$|Line KR {{officers}} did {{not want}} to immediately arrest all the KGB personnel identified by Ames and Hanssen because they did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> the attention of the CIA and FBI (which it did). They wanted to run a game of disinformation. But Washington Resident Stanislav Androsov wished to demonstrate his office's effectiveness to his superiors and ordered the immediate arrest of all who helped the CIA and FBI. After those incidents, the security of residencies was increased and the Line KR was assigned more security officers, especially in countries like the US and England.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{focus of}} the series {{was intended to be}} the relationship between Frasier and Martin, and it was the focus of most of the first-season episodes. Once the show began airing, Niles became a breakout character, and more focus was added to the brothers' relationship, and other plots centering on Niles, starting in the second season. The producers initially did not want to make Niles' wife Maris an unseen character because they did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> parallels to Vera, Norm's wife on Cheers. They originally intended that she would appear after several episodes, but were enjoying writing excuses for her absence that eventually it was decided she would remain unseen, and after the increasingly eccentric characteristics ascribed to her, no real actress could portray her.|$|E
25|$|Further {{advances}} in computing led to greater advancements in interactive computer graphics. In 1959, the TX-2 computer was developed at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory. The TX-2 integrated {{a number of}} new man-machine interfaces. A light pen could be used to draw sketches on the computer using Ivan Sutherland's revolutionary Sketchpad software. Using a light pen, Sketchpad allowed one to draw simple shapes on the computer screen, save them and even recall them later. The light pen itself had a small photoelectric cell in its tip. This cell emitted an electronic pulse whenever it was placed {{in front of a computer}} screen and the screen's electron gun fired directly at it. By simply timing the electronic pulse with the current location of the electron gun, it was easy to pinpoint exactly where the pen was on the screen at any given moment. Once that was determined, the computer could then draw a cursor at that location. Sutherland seemed to find the perfect solution for many of the graphics problems he faced. Even today, many standards of computer graphics interfaces got their start with this early Sketchpad program. One example of this is in drawing constraints. If one wants to draw a square for example, they do not have to worry about drawing four lines perfectly to form the edges of the box. One can simply specify that they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> a box, and then specify the location and size of the box. The software will then construct a perfect box, with the right dimensions and at the right location. Another example is that Sutherland's software modeled objects - not just a picture of objects. In other words, with a model of a car, one could change the size of the tires without affecting the rest of the car. It could stretch the body of car without deforming the tires.|$|E

500|$|On 29 February, Lee Bo {{met with}} Hong Kong police {{and then gave}} a {{televised}} interview on the Hong Kong-based Phoenix Television in an undisclosed location in mainland China, in what was his first public appearance since he went missing.

He denied that he was kidnapped, but did not give details as to how he actually entered Mainland China without his travel documents. Adding that his British citizenship had been sensationalised, Lee Bo says that he will abandon his right of abode in the United Kingdom.|$|E

500|$|In 2000, Hudson and {{two other}} Sisters of her congregation, Carol Gilbert, O.P., and Ardeth Platte, O.P., entered Peterson Air Force Base without {{authorization}} and sprinkled blood on a fighter plane. The trio was caught and arrested. They were then held in a federal prison until the charges were dropped {{because there was no}} lasting damage was done to the airplane. Gilbert claimed that the base was part of the [...] "Star Wars" [...] defense system and the government did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> unnecessary attention to the area. In 2002, the same group of nuns gained access to a Minuteman III missile silo in Colorado. Wearing white hazmat suits emblazoned with [...] "Citizen Weapon Inspection Team," [...] they pounded on the missile, drew a cross in their own blood and prayed for peace. At their pre-trial hearing, the Sisters, dressed in their religious habit, engaged in silent protest by only answering the judge with a nod. When their trial came about, the presiding judge, Robert E. Blackburn, granted an in limine motion to the prosecutor preventing the Sisters from arguing that their actions were legal under international law and the Nuremberg defense. The group was sentenced to between 31 and 40 months for obstructing national defense and damaging government property. The sister's appeal was rejected in 2005 by the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Dan Povenmire, while Peter Shin contributed as supervising director. Various scenes in [...] "PTV" [...] were {{taken out of the}} episode due to Fox's international censors. As the writers worked on the episode the producers ended up, as the Chicago Tribune describes it, [...] "horse trading" [...] with Fox, removing a body-part reference in exchange for a dirty word. While the writing staff of the show was disappointed with the number of scenes that were removed from the episode, they were happy with the final result. The opening sequence, of which Family Guys creator Seth MacFarlane was particularly proud, was added into the episode after the producers discovered the episode ran three minutes short. The episode contained a montage which showcased the most bawdy moments of the previous seasons; Povenmire recalled the sequence; about it he stated that [...] "I just found those off the DVD and digitized them and edited them in. Basically because I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> all those things! I found the most disgusting images from the first three seasons. And we actually got network notes on two of them saying, 'You're gonna have to cut that!' And I went, 'This has been on the air! And I'm only showing 8 frames of it!' And it turns out we cut them now when they're on the air. So apropos for the FCC episode." ...|$|E
500|$|Parker and Stone {{were unhappy}} with the turkey attack subplot, which they felt [...] "never really went anywhere" [...] and ended {{abruptly}} without any satisfying conclusion. They nevertheless included it because they felt obligated to include a B story, since every episode in the season so far had included one. Later in the series, they said they realized this was not necessary and made many episodes without a B story. Although the duo liked the [...] "payoff" [...] of the Starvin' Marvin main plot, {{they did not know}} how to end the turkey subplot, so they simply had the characters kill all the turkeys and claim that there were none left; they decided this sudden ending was the funniest possible option. Stone said of the subplot, [...] "The turkeys were just an excuse to have the Braveheart sequence." [...] The animators enjoyed creating the turkey battle scene, which was designed to be shown in widescreen aspect ratio while the rest of the episode was animated normally. However, the animation proved to be very difficult and took a long time to do because it involved a larger number of characters and animals in one scene than had ever been featured previously in the show. Some of the characters in the far background were animated as gray and shadowy, which Parker said was not so much a visual effect as it was a [...] "lighting effect meaning we didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> all these people".|$|E

2500|$|Kierkegaard {{began his}} 1843 book Either/Or with a question: [...] "Are passions, then, the pagans of the soul? Reason alone baptized?" [...] He didn't want to devote himself to Thought or Speculation like Hegel did. Faith, hope, love, peace, patience, joy, self-control, vanity, kindness, humility, courage, cowardliness, pride, deceit, and selfishness. These are the inner passions that Thought knows little about. Hegel begins {{the process of}} {{education}} with Thought but Kierkegaard thinks we could begin with passion, or {{a balance between the}} two, a balance between Goethe and Hegel. He was against endless reflection with no passion involved. But {{at the same time he}} did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> more attention to the external display of passion but the internal (hidden) passion of the single individual. Kierkegaard clarified this intention in his Journals.|$|E
2500|$|Reading Lolita in Tehran is {{a memoir}} about {{teaching}} government-banned Western literary classics {{to women in}} the world of an Islamic Iran, which author Azar Nafisi describes as dominated in the 1980s by fundamentalist [...] "morality squads". Stories about the lives of her book club members are interspersed with critical commentary on Lolita and three other Western novels. Lolita in particular is dubbed the ultimate [...] "forbidden" [...] novel and becomes a metaphor for life in Iran. Although Nafasi states that the metaphor is not allegorical (p.35), she does <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> parallels between [...] "victim and jailer" [...] (p.37). She implies that, like the principal character in Lolita, the regime in Iran imposes their [...] "dream upon our reality, turning us into his figments of imagination." [...] In both cases, the protagonist commits the [...] "crime of solipsizing another person's life." [...] February 2011 saw the premiere of a concert performance of an opera based on Reading Lolita in Tehran at the University of Maryland School of Music with music by doctoral student Elisabeth Mehl Greene and a libretto co-written by Iranian-American poet Mitra Motlagh. Azar Nafasi was closely involved {{in the development of the}} project and participated in an audience Q session after the premiere.|$|E
