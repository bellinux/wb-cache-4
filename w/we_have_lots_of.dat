500|$|Lemmings {{has also}} been called a {{predecessor}} of the modern real-time strategy (RTS) video game genre. A 1991 Amiga Power article claimed that Lemmings [...] "was the first major game to introduce the 'indirect-control' concept," [...] an element that is now common in many RTS games. Blizzard Entertainment developer Bob Fitch said {{that part of the}} inspiration for the first Warcraft game, , was based on developing a competitive multiplayer RTS that combined elements of The Lost Vikings (which he had worked on) and Lemmings; Fitch said [...] "We just went, 'Oh it's so cool when you see lots of Lemmings all over the place. Why don't <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> Vikings all over instead, and then the Vikings can fight each other." [...] Lemmings introduction of RTS elements has been noted by fantasy author Terry Pratchett; in his novel Interesting Times, an army of golems is controlled in a fashion reminiscent of the Lemmings user interface. When readers asked if this was deliberate, Pratchett responded: [...] "Merely because the red army can fight, dig, march and climb and is controlled by little icons? Can't imagine how anyone thought that... Not only did I wipe Lemmings from my hard disk, I overwrote it so I couldn't get it back." ...|$|E
