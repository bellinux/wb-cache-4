5|$|By 1921, Tzara {{had become}} {{involved}} in conflicts with other figures in the movement, whom he claimed had parted {{with the spirit of}} Dada. He was targeted by the Berlin-based Dadaists, in particular by Huelsenbeck and Serner, the former of whom was also involved in a conflict with Raoul Hausmann over leadership status. According to Richter, tensions between Breton and Tzara had surfaced in 1920, when Breton first made known his <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> away with musical performances altogether and alleged that the Romanian was merely repeating himself. The Dada shows themselves were by then such common occurrences that audiences expected to be insulted by the performers.|$|E

25|$|The movement's {{official}} policy on child protection, which discusses the {{procedures for reporting}} child sexual abuse, states that elders obey all legal requirements for reporting sex offenders, including reporting uncorroborated or unsubstantiated allegations where required by law.

50|$|Eck {{claimed that}} Browning <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a {{follow-up}} picture {{with him and}} Robert where he would play a mad scientist's creation. However, Browning's career was irretrievably hurt by Freaks, and {{he no longer had}} the clout with studios <b>to</b> <b>do</b> many of the projects he <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Eck was also disappointed by how much of his part had been trimmed from the film in the nearly thirty minutes that were cut by censors.|$|R

25|$|Christopher Lambert did not <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> television, {{though he}} agreed {{that there should}} be a series, and {{originally}} Connor MacLeod was to be the protagonist. After Lambert declined, and because there were still films being made with the Connor character, it was decided at Adrian Paul's request to have the series focus on another MacLeod. Lambert agreed to appear in the pilot and pass the torch. They were only able to afford him for three days of filming. Lambert declined to do any future episodes.|$|E

25|$|In Denmark, {{occupational}} safety and health is regulated by the Danish Act on Working Environment and cooperation at the workplace. The Danish Working Environment Authority carries out inspections of companies, draws up more detailed rules on health and safety at work and provides information on health and safety at work. The result of each inspection is made public on the web pages of the Danish Working Environment Authority so that the general public, current and prospective employees, customers and other stakeholders can inform themselves about whether a given organization has passed the inspection, should they <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the course}} of his public service career, which began in 1998 with his first-time {{candidacy}} for President of the Republic, Noboa has been the object of multiple denunciations and labor- and tax- related allegations, as well as political and personal, ideological attacks, by what he describes as powerful and influential political and commercial adversaries from within the country who <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> him harm via a permanent smear campaign aimed at denigrating his honor and that of his family, thereby evading his fight against corruption on behalf of the poor and undermining his aim to transform Ecuador into a developed country.|$|E
25|$|Those who <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this {{therefore}} separate {{themselves from}} the world and live as monastics: monks and nuns. As ascetics par excellence, using the allegorical weapons of prayer and fasting in spiritual warfare against their passions, monastics hold a very special and important place in the Church. This kind of life is often seen as incompatible {{with any kind of}} worldly activity including that which is normally regarded as virtuous. Social work, school teaching, and other such work is therefore usually left to laypeople. Ascetics of the Orthodox Church are recognized by their long hair, and in case of male monks, long beards.|$|E

25|$|Pauline Quirke {{was cast}} as secretive caravan {{resident}} Susan Wright. Chibnall {{had long been}} deeply impressed with her performance on the 1996 television series The Sculptress, and he wrote the role of Susan Wright with Quirke in mind, although the role was not written specifically for her. Although Quirke was a well-known veteran television actress, she auditioned along with many others for the role. Her audition, like that of others, used scenes from the first two episodes. Chibnall says that the producers worried that such a big star might not <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> justice to such small role, but found that Quirke delivered a superb performance.|$|E
25|$|European modellers {{have the}} option to convert the {{couplings}} on their rolling stock to the Fleischmann Profi-Coupler system for more reliable operation should they <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, but most N scale rolling stock continues to be manufactured with Rapido couplers - a design which is fairly robust and easy to mold. Modern N scale stock uses a standard NEM socket for couplers which allows different coupling designs to be used by simply pulling out the old coupler and fitting a new one of a different design. In the United Kingdom, vendors are increasingly shipping both NEM sockets for couplers and buckeye (knuckle) couplers.|$|E
25|$|UDDTs are {{sometimes}} considered too expensive compared to pit latrines, but this criticism {{does not include}} the cost of emptying pits and the potential value of fertilizers that can be recycled via UDDTs should the users <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so (noting that most UDDT installations worldwide currently do not reuse excreta in agriculture). Rather than looking only at construction costs, long-term operational costs and benefits should also be considered, especially since the regular emptying or re-building of pit latrines may be a significant expense. When a period of for example 10 years is considered, UDDTs may well be the more economical alternative, since the emptying of feces vaults is simple and safer, thus less expensive, even if users decide to enter into a contract with someone else to do this.|$|E
