5|$|Originally {{developed}} for welding aluminium and other non-ferrous {{materials in the}} 1940s, GMAW was soon applied to steels because it provided faster <b>welding</b> <b>time</b> compared to other welding processes. The cost of inert gas limited its use in steels until several years later, when the use of semi-inert gases such as carbon dioxide became common. Further developments during the 1950s and 1960s gave the process more versatility and as a result, it became a highly used industrial process. Today, GMAW {{is the most common}} industrial welding process, preferred for its versatility, speed and the relative ease of adapting the process to robotic automation. Unlike welding processes that do not employ a shielding gas, such as shielded metal arc welding, it is rarely used outdoors or in other areas of air volatility. A related process, flux cored arc welding, often does not use a shielding gas, but instead employs an electrode wire that is hollow and filled with flux.|$|E
5000|$|Electric {{resistance}} welding (ERW) {{refers to a}} group of welding processes such as spot and seam welding that produce coalescence of faying surfaces where heat to form the weld is generated by the electrical resistance of material combined with the time and the force used to hold the materials together during welding. Some factors influencing heat or welding temperatures are the proportions of the workpieces, the metal coating or the lack of coating, the electrode materials, electrode geometry, electrode pressing force, electrical current and length of <b>welding</b> <b>time.</b> Small pools of molten metal are formed at the point of most electrical resistance (the connecting or [...] "faying" [...] surfaces) as an electrical current (100 - 100,000 A) is passed through the metal. In general, {{resistance welding}} methods are efficient and cause little pollution, but their applications are limited to relatively thin materials and the equipment cost can be high (although in production situations the cost per weld may be low).|$|E
5000|$|Reinforced {{thermoplastic}} pipe (RTP) is {{a generic}} term {{referring to a}} reliable high strength synthetic fibre (such as glass, aramid or carbon), initially developed in the early 1990s by Wavin Repox, Akzo Nobel and by Tubes d'Aquitaine from France, who developed the first pipes reinforced with synthetic fibre to replace medium pressure steel pipes in response to growing demand for non-corrosive conduits for application in the onshore oil and gas industry, particularly in the Middle East. [...] Typically, the materials used {{in the construction of}} the pipe might be Polyethylene (PE), Polyamide-11 or PVDF and may be reinforced with Aramid or Polyester fibre although other combinations are used.More recently the technology of producing such pipe, including the marketing, rests with a few key companies, one of which is Pipelife with Soluforce where it is available in coils up to 400 m length. These pipes are available in pressure ratings from [...] Over the last few years this type of pipe has been acknowledged as a standard alternative solution to steel for oilfield flowline applications by certain oil companies and operators. The great advantage of this pipe is also its very fast installation time compared to steel pipe when considering the <b>welding</b> <b>time</b> as average speeds up to 1000 m/day have been reached installing RTP in ground surface.|$|E
30|$|The {{results of}} pullout {{resistance}} {{are summarized in}} Table  1.

For the pretreated group, pullout resistance for <b>welded</b> <b>time</b> 3  s was 37.91 and 56.61 % higher than the <b>welded</b> <b>time</b> 5 and 7  s, respectively. In both the untreated group and pretreated group, with the extension of <b>welded</b> <b>time,</b> the pullout resistance decreased. The pullout resistance of <b>welded</b> <b>time</b> 3  s samples showed the smallest variability and the best reliability. According to the experimental results, <b>welded</b> <b>time</b> 3  s was {{the best choice for}} welding in this study.|$|R
30|$|The {{pretreatment}} of {{wood dowel}} with CuCl 2 could effectively improve the pullout resistance of wood dowel welding. The samples with <b>welded</b> <b>time</b> 3  s pretreated with CuCl 2 showed the best pullout resistance, {{and it was}} 68.28 % higher than untreated samples with <b>welded</b> <b>time</b> 3  s. In both the untreated group and pretreated group, pullout resistance was affected by the different <b>welded</b> <b>times.</b> With {{the extension of the}} <b>welded</b> <b>time,</b> pullout resistance decreased. The pullout resistance of <b>welded</b> <b>time</b> 3  s was 28.33 % and 87.12 % higher than that for <b>welded</b> <b>times</b> 5 and 7  s, respectively.

30|$|The {{mean values}} of the 3  s <b>welded</b> <b>time</b> samples with {{untreated}} wood dowels were 2790  N, and in the pretreatment groups 4695  N. It was 59 % higher than the untreated <b>welded</b> <b>time</b> 3  s samples. In other words, the <b>welded</b> <b>time</b> 3  s samples pretreated with CuCl 2 showed better pullout resistance. It almost reached 5000  N, which is the tensile strength of wood dowel itself. On the other hand, the coefficient of variation of the pretreatment group was 15.2 % and the untreated group was 15.9 %, indicating that pullout resistance of <b>welded</b> <b>time</b> 3  s with pretreated wood dowels showed the smallest variability and better concentration. <b>Welded</b> <b>time</b> 5  s groups and <b>welded</b> <b>time</b> 7  s groups also showed that pretreatment with CuCl 2 could improve the pullout resistance. Therefore, pretreatment with CuCl 2 could significantly improve the welding properties.|$|R
50|$|Spot welding is a {{resistance}} welding method used to join {{two or more}} overlapping metal sheets, studs, projections, electrical wiring hangers, some heat exchanger fins, and some tubing. Usually power sources and welding equipment are sized to the specific thickness and material being welded together. The thickness {{is limited by the}} output of the welding power source and thus the equipment range due to the current required for each application. Care is taken to eliminate contaminants between the faying surfaces. Usually, two copper electrodes are simultaneously used to clamp the metal sheets together and to pass current through the sheets. When the current is passed through the electrodes to the sheets, heat is generated due to the higher electrical resistance where the surfaces contact each other. As the electrical resistance of the material causes a heat buildup in the work pieces between the copper electrodes, the rising temperature causes a rising resistance, and results in a molten pool contained most of the time between the electrodes. As the heat dissipates throughout the workpiece in less than a second (resistance <b>welding</b> <b>time</b> is generally programmed as a quantity of AC cycles or milliseconds) the molten or plastic state grows to meet the welding tips. When the current is stopped the copper tips cool the spot weld, causing the metal to solidify under pressure. The water cooled copper electrodes remove the surface heat quickly, accelerating the solidification of the metal, since copper is an excellent conductor. Resistance spot welding typically employs electrical power in the form of direct current, alternating current, medium frequency half-wave direct current, or high-frequency half wave direct current.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{influence}} of two selected parameters (the <b>welding</b> <b>time</b> {{and the presence of}} the activating flux {{on the surface of the}} base metal) on the weld joint at Stud Arc Welding process is investigated. In the experimental part of the paper, the drawn arc stud welding process with the ceramic ferrule is applied with the different <b>welding</b> <b>time</b> and the application of the activating flux for ATIG process. In order to evaluate {{the influence}} of the <b>welding</b> <b>time</b> and the activating flux on the weld characteristics, the cast zone width and Vickers hardness HV 0. 2 are measured...|$|E
40|$|A {{change in}} linear welding conditions, namely higher {{vibration}} frequency (150 Hz) and lower displacement (2 mm) during welding, produced a quicker rise in {{temperature of the}} weldline. This allowed a much shorter <b>welding</b> <b>time</b> (1. 5 s). X-ray microdensitometry mapping showed a progressive increase in broadening and average density of the weldline as the <b>welding</b> <b>time</b> lengthens. As the <b>welding</b> <b>time</b> lengthens the maximum temperature reached {{at the end of}} welding is progressively higher. This causes increasingly greater degradation. This effect was confirmed also by CP-MAS 13 C NMR and {{it was found that the}} lower is the degree of deterioration of the weldline of the wood joint the shorter is the <b>welding</b> <b>time.</b> Monitoring of the temperature of the weldline showed that the temperature reached in wood joints during welding was inversely correlated to its water resistance. Furthermore, the increase in weldline temperature is markedly quicker at a vibration frequency of 150 Hz than at 100 Hz. Thus, the shorter is the <b>welding</b> <b>time</b> the lower is the degree of deterioration of the weldline of the wood joint. This appears to be due to welding occuring when water vapour is still present in the joint, hence providing a less damaging welding environment...|$|E
30|$|From Fig.  4, the {{temperature}} trend of each measuring point at different <b>welded</b> <b>times</b> was similar. But in <b>welded</b> <b>time</b> 7  s experimental group, {{the temperature}}s at depth of 23 and 28  mm {{were significantly different}} from the other two groups of <b>welded</b> <b>time</b> 3 and 5  s. The highest temperature of each depth of the <b>welded</b> <b>time</b> 3 s group was lower than that of the other two groups, indicating that relatively smaller amount of heat generated by shorter friction <b>time.</b> In the <b>welding</b> interface, <b>welded</b> <b>time</b> 5  s experimental group had much more black melt material than the <b>welded</b> <b>time</b> of 3  s experimental group, and the black melt material overflowed from the wall of the hole between the wood dowel and the larch substrate (Fig.  5). This phenomenon showed that due to the extension of the friction time, the heat generated by friction was relatively large, which resulted in more molten material. However, in the <b>welded</b> <b>time</b> 7  s experimental group, the friction time was further increased with more molten material overflow, resulting in the welding interface layer not having enough molten material to fill. So it caused cracking phenomenon and also made the 23 and 28  mm temperature less than the <b>welded</b> <b>time</b> 5  s experimental group. But there was still a small amount of molten material flow into these two points; so the temperature was still higher than that of the <b>welded</b> <b>time</b> 3  s experimental group.|$|R
30|$|From the DTG curves, {{unlike the}} {{untreated}} group, the wood dowel and welding interface materials of the pretreated group showed two peaks at 310 and 352  °C, respectively. The {{results indicated that}} the acid hydrolysis of hemicellulose and cellulose was caused by the pretreatment with CuCl 2, and the pyrolysis temperature of the relevant components was early. The peak temperature around 352  °C showed a decreasing trend with the extension of the <b>welded</b> <b>time,</b> and it even disappeared for the pretreated specimens with <b>welded</b> <b>time</b> 7  s. The extension of the <b>welded</b> <b>time</b> led to a greater degree of pyrolysis of hemicellulose and cellulose, as well as the breakage of the long cellulose chain. The peak near 310  °C of CuCl 2 pretreated samples with <b>welded</b> <b>time</b> 3  s was the strongest, the samples with <b>welded</b> <b>time</b> 7  s slightly weaker, and the samples with <b>welded</b> <b>time</b> 5  s the weakest. The peak strength near 310  °C of the samples of <b>welded</b> <b>time</b> 7  s pretreated with CuCl 2 was lower than that of the <b>welded</b> <b>time</b> 3  s group. It showed that the higher degree of hemicellulose and cellulose components pyrolysis during welding for <b>welded</b> <b>time</b> 7 s group. The peak strength near 310  °C of the samples with <b>welded</b> <b>time</b> 7 s pretreated with CuCl 2  was higher than that of welded time 5  s group. Beacuse the interface material components of <b>welded</b> <b>time</b> 7  s group were pyrolysis basically in the vicinity of 310  °C, but part of the interface material component of <b>welded</b> <b>time</b> 5  s group were pyrolysis in the vicinity of 352  °C. After 390  °C, the pyrolysis rate of pretreated interface material was significantly higher than that of the untreated interface material. This was probably because of the greater degree of hemicellulose and cellulose pyrolysis in the interface material pretreated with CuCl 2 during the welding process, resulting in a relative increase in lignin content and then the pyrolysis rate increase. It may also result from the role of acid hydrolysis in the impregnation process and the effect of friction tearing during the welding process, which made the lignin more exposed to the pretreated interface material, causing the pyrolysis rate to increase during the TG analysis.|$|R

Ultrasonic {{spot welding}} of {{galvanized}} steel sheets {{has been conducted}} to investigate formation process of the weld microstructure, and effect of zinc coat on joint property. The joint strength showed a rapidly increase at the <b>weld</b> <b>time</b> of 0. 8 s, {{and it has the}} maximum value over 1. 0 s.

The formation process of weld microstructure of ultrasonic welding was proposed to be a two-steps process. First, zinc coat in the interface was mechanically removed by the vibration and clamping force, and some zinc particles dispersed in the weld interface. Second, the zinc particles melted due to the friction, and partially bonded regions were simultaneously formed around the zinc particles. The partially bonded regions were stirred with the steel substrate as the <b>weld</b> <b>time</b> increased. The joint strength increased by development of the stirred zone.

The first of these effects predominates at shorter <b>welding</b> <b>times</b> while at slightly longer <b>welding</b> <b>times</b> both effects occur with the second one progressively becoming the bigger contributor. In the latter case the some μm thin densified surface is a surface composite formed by the networked unsaturated oil permeating the wood fibre/fused lignin composite...|$|R

The effects of four factors namely <b>weld</b> current, <b>weld</b> <b>time,</b> electrode force and hold time were studied using a general 24 factorial design augmented by five centre points. The results of the analysis showed that all selected factors except hold time exhibit significant effect on weld nugget radius and HAZ size. Optimization of the welding parameters (<b>weld</b> current, <b>weld</b> <b>time</b> and electrode force) to normalize weld nugget and to minimize HAZ size was then conducted using Central Composite Design (CCD) in Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and the optimum parameters were determined. A regression model for radius of weld nugget and HAZ size was developed and its adequacy was evaluated. The experimental results obtained under optimum operating conditions were then compared with the predicted values and were found to agree satisfactorily with each other...|$|R
