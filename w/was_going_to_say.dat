5|$|In {{his final}} days, Irwin sold his rights from his {{scoreboard}} business for $2000. Though he sent $1500 to May and only $500 to Elizabeth, his Boston widow {{was surprised at}} the gesture since Irwin rarely visited Boston and provided almost no financial support to their family. In fact, May said that he had not been away from New York {{for more than a few}} days at a time in 27 years. She said that his only long trips were baseball-related, when he would scout players in other cities. Before he left New York for the final time, he told May that he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> goodbye to friends in Boston and that he would return to New York. Though neither woman knew of the other, Irwin's New York son Harold learned about an unknown brother while he was visiting his father in the hospital just before Irwin's death.|$|E

When I send a bit of investigation to Edinburgh, the W. H. of that ilk says I took it from him. When I send you one, you take it from me, generalize it at a glance, bestow it thus generalized upon society at large, and make me the second discoverer of a known theorem.|$|E
500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of the 24 April, in Hamburg for the press conference the following day, Trevor-Roper asked Heidemann for the name of his source: the journalist refused, and gave a different story of how the diaries had been acquired. Trevor-Roper was suspicious and questioned the reporter closely for over an hour. Heidemann accused the historian of acting [...] "exactly like an officer of the British army" [...] in 1945. At a subsequent dinner the historian was evasive when asked by Stern executives what he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> at the announcement the following day.|$|E

Two of Michael's lines, [...] "The hand strikes {{and gives a}} flower" [...] and [...] "Blessed be those who sit and wait" [...] were described by Wilson as Confucian and biblical, respectively. Carell joked that Michael Scott himself should self-publish a book of inspirational sayings. Jenna Fischer revealed that her line, [...] "Please don't throw garbage at me" [...] was her favorite line of the first season. Michael's line, [...] "Try {{not to be too}} gay on the court" [...] was improvised by Carell and Krasinski's reaction was real, as he had no idea Carell <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it.|$|E
500|$|After the {{publication}} in 1915 of Cathay, Pound mentioned {{he was working}} on a long poem, casting about for the correct form. He told a friend in August: [...] "It is a huge, I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> gamble, but shan't," [...] and in September described it as a [...] "cryselephantine poem of immeasurable length which will occupy me for the next four decades unless it becomes a bore." [...] About a year later, in January 1917, he had the first three trial cantos, distilled to one, published as Canto I in Poetry. He was now a regular contributor to three literary magazines. From 1917 he wrote music reviews for The New Age under the pen name William Atheling, and weekly pieces for The Egoist and The Little Review; many of the latter were directed against provincialism and ignorance. The volume of writing exhausted him. He feared he was wasting his time writing outside poetry, exclaiming that he [...] "must stop writing so much prose".|$|E
500|$|On May 1, 1991, Henderson {{stole his}} 939th base to pass Lou Brock {{and became the}} sport's all-time stolen base leader. Henderson's speech (at right) after {{breaking}} Brock's record {{was similar to the}} standard victory or award speech. He thanked God and his mother, as well as the people that helped him in baseball. Because his idol was Muhammad Ali, Henderson decided to use the words [...] "greatest of all time." [...] These words have since been taken by many to support the notion that Henderson is selfish and arrogant, although years later, Henderson revealed that he had gone over his planned remarks ahead of time with Brock, and the Cardinals Hall of Famer [...] "had no problem with it. In fact, he helped me write what I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that day." [...] On the day of the speech, Brock later told reporters amiably, [...] "He spoke from his heart." [...] Brock and Henderson had had a friendly relationship ever since their first meeting in 1981. Brock pronounced the young speedster as the heir to his record, saying, [...] "How are we gonna break it?" ...|$|E

500|$|Reba McEntire {{began work}} on her 24th studio album, , by {{creating}} a [...] "wish list" [...] of pop and country singers that {{she would like to}} duet with. After completing her residency show at the Las Vegas Hilton, McEntire began reaching out to the artists on her list, by phone and e-mail. She came into contact with Justin Timberlake through Joanna García, who portrayed McEntire's daughter on the sitcom Reba and was dating Timberlake's friend Trace Ayala. Timberlake and McEntire {{met for the first time}} at the 49th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony on February 11, 2007. She asked him to be a part of the project, to which he replied: [...] "Okay, great, I'll write something. Is that okay?". McEntire was skeptical at first, unsure of [...] "what he was going to bring back to [...] ". According to McEntire, she didn't know if the song was going to be [...] "SexyBack 2, 3 or 4". She revealed: [...] "I was really nervous. I didn't know how I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> no to a song I didn't like if Justin had written it." ...|$|E
500|$|On April 2, 2014, the News Journal {{reported}} that Bevin {{spoke at a}} pro-cockfighting rally in Corbin, Kentucky. Asked about his attendance, Bevin said he understood that the rally was a states' rights event: [...] "I {{was the first person}} to speak and then I left." [...] Organizers of the event, which was closed to the media, said there was [...] "never any ambiguity" [...] regarding its purpose, and WAVE in Louisville published an undercover video from the event showing that Bevin was the third speaker; the speaker who immediately preceded Bevin said the rally was held [...] "for the sole purpose of legalizing gamecock fighting at the state level." [...] Bevin told a WAVE reporter, [...] "I honestly wasn't even paying attention. I was thinking about what I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> I don't even remember him saying that." [...] The WAVE video also showed an attendee asking Bevin if he would support the legalization of cockfighting in Kentucky, to which he replied, [...] "I support the people of Kentucky exercising their right, because it is our right to decide what it is that we want to do, and not the federal government's. Criminalizing behavior, if it's part of the heritage of this state, is in my opinion a bad idea. A bad idea. I will not support it." [...] Bevin was referencing the Agricultural Act of 2014, commonly called the [...] "farm bill", which contained a provision that criminalized spectators at cockfighting events.|$|E

2500|$|Douglas found Stern's next job, hosting mornings at album-oriented rock station WWDC in Washington, D.C. Stern was {{cautious}} about the offer at first {{as the general}} manager [...] "was not really aware of what I did", but accepted the offer and started on March 2, 1981. During his time relocating from Detroit, Stern spent several weeks planning out a new show, determined to become more successful as the station presented a good chance for him to work in New York City, his career goal. He was determined to [...] "kill my competition. I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> whatever the fuck I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> ... The {{first step was to}} put my team together". He sought a co-host {{with a sense of humor}} to riff with on news and current events. The station then paired Stern with Robin Quivers, a former nurse in the air force and news reporter at WFBR in Baltimore. Quivers was sent a tape of Stern interviewing a prostitute on the air, and accepted the job without meeting him. She assumed she [...] "would come in and do the news ... but it wasn't that way". Despite several issues management had over content, which led to the installation of a seven-second delay to censor questionable moments, Stern [...] "kept chipping away at management's archaic approach and we began to assemble the program I had envisioned", which included the addition of Norris as his writer and producer. In one incident, Stern revealed his wife's miscarriage on the air. In January 1982, Stern had the second highest rated morning show in the city.|$|E

2500|$|After he was {{reported}} in the press as saying homosexuals should [...] "repent and be changed", he made further comments in which he clarified his remarks. He stated that he had initially said to the journalist from the Telegraph that he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> in his sermon that all people, particularly churches and Christians, should repent, because there was a need [...] "to refocus on the faith of the church from down the ages and an authentic mission to the nations." [...] When asked specifically about whether this included homosexuals, he had said that yes, it included everybody and went on to give his interpretation of the Christian view of human sexuality, marriage and the family, saying that we were all sinners and in continual need of repentance for our shortcomings.|$|E
2500|$|In 1933 and 1934 MacDonald's {{mental and}} {{physical}} health declined further, and he became an increasingly ineffective leader as the international situation grew more threatening. His speeches in Commons became incoherent. One observer noted how [...] "Things ... got to the stage where nobody knew what the Prime Minister <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> in the House of Commons, and, when he did say it, nobody understood it." [...] His pacifism, which had been widely admired in the 1920s, led Winston Churchill and others to accuse him of failure {{to stand up to the}} threat of Adolf Hitler. His government began the negotiations for the Anglo-German Naval Agreement. MacDonald was aware of his fading powers, and in 1935 he agreed to a timetable with Baldwin to stand down as Prime Minister after George V's Silver Jubilee celebrations in May 1935. He resigned on 7 June in favour of Baldwin, and remained in the cabinet, taking the largely honorary post of Lord President vacated by Baldwin.|$|E
2500|$|Laurie's parents, {{who were}} of Scottish descent, {{attended}} St. Columba's Presbyterian Church of England (now United Reformed Church) in Oxford. He notes that [...] "belief in God didn't play {{a large role}} in my home, but a certain attitude to life and the living of it did". He followed this by stating, [...] "Pleasure was something that was treated with great suspicion, pleasure was something that... I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it had to be earned but even the earning of it didn't really work. It was something to this day, I mean, I carry that with me. I find pleasure a difficult thing; I don't know what you do with it, I don't know where to put it." [...] He later stated, [...] "I don't believe in God, but I have this idea that if there were a God, or destiny of some kind looking down on us, that if he saw you taking anything for granted he'd take it away." ...|$|E

2500|$|On July 6, 2009, Ryan Ross and Jon Walker {{announced}} via the band's {{official website}} {{that the two}} were leaving the band.

Though the four of us have made music together in the past, we’ve creatively evolved in different directions which has compromised what each of us want to personally achieve.
