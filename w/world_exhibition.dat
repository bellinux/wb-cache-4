The vehicle was a series hybrid car, that used an electric hub motor at each wheel, powered by batteries, which were in turn charged by a gasoline-engine generator.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{educational}} {{sections of the}} great international exhibitions of {{the latter half of}} the nineteenth century. This thesis takes into account the participation of actors from France, Germany, Japan and the United States. Focusing on education experts, this thesis is a contribution to a sociocultural history of an intellectual and administrative elite in an age of early globalisation. <b>World</b> <b>exhibitions</b> were one of the major media for the transnational circulation of educational knowledge. The central question is why education experts from these four countries invested so many resources in order to prepare and visit <b>world</b> <b>exhibitions.</b> Why did they go transnational? The thesis proposes two answers. Firstly, education experts used <b>world</b> <b>exhibitions</b> in order to appropriate the most advanced pedagogical models for their own institutional contexts. The concept of cultural transfers is a useful tool to analyse these appropriations. Knowledge circulation at <b>world</b> <b>exhibitions</b> made a crucial contribution to the institutionalisation of primary education and technical education. Secondly, education experts used <b>world</b> <b>exhibitions</b> to stage their own institutions on an international stage. The proud representation of the educational achievements of one’s own context was the final phase of successful cultural transfers. Educational displays became increasingly embedded in nationalist discourses. During the 1870 s pedagogical know-how circulated relatively easily. Towards the turn of the century the self-representation of institutions became predominant. This original approach aims at furthering the understanding of globalisation in the nineteenth century. Still, the thesis argues that <b>world</b> <b>exhibitions</b> were in a large measure media for transnational professional discourses in many fields, including education...|$|R

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} energy efficiency demonstration projects was the 1986 Energy <b>World</b> <b>exhibition</b> in Milton Keynes, which attracted international interest. Fifty-one houses were built, designed to be at least 30% more efficient than the Building Regulations then in force. This was calculated using the Milton Keynes Energy Cost Index (MKECI), a test-bed for the subsequent SAP rating system and the National Home Energy Rating scheme. Energy World was preceded by the earlier Salford low-energy houses, built in the early 1980s, which continue to be 40% more efficient than the 2010 Building Regulations.|$|E

In 1888 he traveled to Southern Russia and the Caucasus, where he did sketches and studies of descendants of the Zaporozhian Cossacks.

He wrote his reminiscences of Leo Tolstoy, gave a speech on artistic education, and painted Alexander Pushkin at the Lyceum Speech-Day, 8 January 1815. In 1912 He produced paintings related to the centenary of Napoleon's invasion of Russia. In 1913 he worked on restoring his painting Ivan the Terrible and His Son. In 1914 Natalia Nordman died in Locarno, and Repin attended her funeral there, afterwards going to Italy, before returning home to the Penates.|$|E

In 1916 Repin worked on his book of reminiscences, Far and Near, with the assistance of Korney Chukovsky. He welcomed the Russian Revolution of 1917. Celebrations were held in 1924 in Kuokkala to mark Repin's 80th birthday, followed by an exhibition of his works in Moscow. In 1925 a jubilee exhibition of his works was held in the Russian Museum in Leningrad. Repin died in 1930 and was buried at the Penates.|$|E

In 1902–1903 his works included the paintings Ceremonial Meeting of the State Council and What a Freedom!, over forty portrait studies, and portraits of Sergei Witte and Vyacheslav von Plehve.

25|$|Polyakov pioneered {{fast-track}} railroad construction schedules, introducing {{new standards}} of project management promoted by his new {{ally in the}} government, minister Pavel Melnikov. Kursk-Kharkiv-Azov mainline (780 verst, commissioned in two stages in July and December 1869) was built in a record time of 22 months; it provided the first reliable rail link for Donets Basin coal mines where Polyakov had substantial interests. He also acquired a concession to build a steel foundry in Azov, but eventually preferred to sell the rights to John Hughes. During the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878) Polyakov was commissioned to build two frontline railroads, Bendery-Galaţi and Frăteşti-Zimnica. Actual construction was managed by Mikhail Danilov. The speed of building these railroads earned Polyakov a medal of the Paris <b>World</b> <b>Exhibition</b> of 1878 and over 20 million roubles from the government, including a 4.5 million time bonus.|$|E
25|$|Ichthyosaurs {{became even}} more popular in 1854 by the {{rebuilding}} at Sydenham Hill of the Crystal Palace, originally erected at the <b>world</b> <b>exhibition</b> of 1851. In the surrounding park, life-sized, painted, concrete statues of extinct animals were placed, which were designed by Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins {{under the direction of}} Richard Owen. Among them were three models of an ichthyosaur. Although it was known that ichthyosaurs had been animals of the open seas, they were shown basking on the shore, a convention followed by many nineteenth century illustrations with the aim, as Conybeare once explained, of better exposing their build. This led to the misunderstanding that they really had an amphibious lifestyle. The pools in the park were at the time subjected to tidal changes, so that fluctuations in the water level at intervals submerged the ichthyosaur statues, adding a certain realism. Remarkably, internal skeletal structures, such as the scleral rings and the many phalanges of the flippers, were shown at the outside.|$|E
500|$|The idea of {{hosting the}} 1967 <b>World</b> <b>Exhibition</b> {{dates back to}} 1956, {{but it was in}} 1958 that Conservative Senator Mark Drouin {{suggested}} during his speech at the Brussels Exhibition that Canada should host a <b>World</b> <b>Exhibition</b> to celebrate its centennial. The exposition was offered first to Toronto but politicians there rejected the idea. However, Montreal's mayor, Sarto Fournier, backed the proposal, allowing Canada to make a bid to the Bureau International des Expositions (BIE). [...] At the BIE's May 5, 1960 meeting in Paris, [...] Moscow was awarded the fair after five rounds of voting that eliminated Austria's and then Canada's bids. [...] In April 1962, the Soviets scrapped plans to host the fair because of financial constraints and security concerns. Montreal's new mayor, Jean Drapeau, lobbied the Canadian government to try again for the fair, which they did. [...] On November 13, 1962, the BIE changed the location of the <b>World</b> <b>Exhibition</b> to Canada, and Expo 67 {{went on to become the}} fourth-best attended BIE-sanctioned world expositions, after Shanghai, Osaka, and Paris.|$|E
