5|$|Although {{the film}} {{takes place in}} Blackeberg, a suburb of Stockholm, {{principal}} photography took place in Luleå (in the north of Sweden) to ensure enough snow and cold weather. The area where the filming took place dated from {{around the same time}} as Blackeberg, and has similar architecture. However, Alfredson shot a few scenes in the Blackeberg area. In particular, the scene where Eli leaps down on Virginia from a tree, <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> town square of Blackeberg. Another scene, where Eli attacks Jocke in an underpass, <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nearby suburb of Råcksta. The original Blackeberg underpass that Lindqvist had envisioned was deemed too high to fit in the picture. Some of the outdoor close-up scenes were made in a super cold studio. The jungle gym where much of the interaction between Oskar and Eli takes place was constructed specifically for the film. Its design was intended to suit the CinemaScope format better than a regular jungle gym, which would typically have to be cropped height-wise.|$|E

Most <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{three weeks before}} Christmas because Rush would be performing in a play in January. The schedule was further complicated by Bonham Carter's availability: she worked on Harry Potter during the week, so her scenes had to be filmed during the weekend.|$|E

5|$|Already before this, in 1430, FitzAlan had {{departed}} for France, where {{he held a}} series of important command positions. He served under John, Duke of Bedford, the uncle of the eight-year-old King Henry VI. FitzAlan was involved in recovering fortresses in the Île-de-France region, and in suppressing local rebellions. His military career ended, however, at the Battle of Gerbevoy in 1435. Refusing to retreat in the face of superior forces, Arundel <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> foot and captured. His leg was later amputated, and he died shortly afterwards from the injury. His final resting place was a matter of dispute until the mid-nineteenth century, when his tomb at Arundel Castle was revealed to contain a skeleton missing one leg.|$|E
5|$|As {{soon as it}} was {{sufficiently}} dark, Grayburn led his platoon along the ramp to the bridge, their faces blackened and their boots muffled with strips of torn up curtains.

Grayburn <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shoulder but continued to press his men on, until the withering enemy fire became too intense and he was forced to pull them back.

After he ran out of ammunition, he called for more cartridges, but C. S. Fly took his pistol at about the time the general shooting ended.|$|E
