25|$|Dinner is {{interrupted}} by Don Gabriel del Lago, a friend of Don Santiago's and a neighboring Spanish-Mexican landowner, who brings news that Texas has been taken from Mexico by the Americans, and that American soldiers {{under the leadership of}} Zachary Taylor have infiltrated the territory and are busy establishing defensive outposts. Each of the characters responds to this turn of events differently: Don Santiago scoffs, refusing to consider Americans any threat to his way of life; Alvaro <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> military action can be undertaken to stave off the American forces; Luis Gonzaga contemplates whether or not Americans really are the uncultured hoodlums he has heard them to be; María de los Ángeles, under the assumption that Americans are not Catholic, assumes the invasion is punishment from God for Mexico's sins; and Susanita wonders {{what it would be like}} to dance with a tall white-skinned man.|$|E
25|$|Acting {{as if he}} is {{not bothered}} by Dr. Lee exiling him, Devon {{contacts}} A's rival school Morris Brown College, to discuss playing for their marching band next season. Mr. Wade, Brown's band leader, says that Devon does not {{need to know how to}} read music and will likely get a full scholarship and a good position on the drumline. When Wade <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> Dr. Lee is planning for the BET Big Southern Classic (a large competition of college bands), Devon realizes that his heart and honor are still with the A band. He rejects the scholarship offer from the rival band and returns to A Though Devon is still not playing for the band, he cannot give up his drumming. He is sent cassette tapes from his estranged father and gets some ideas for new drum arrangements. He and Sean have a final confrontation, with Sean telling Devon that he is A's best drummer but that the band is bigger than just one person; this clears the air and they begin to work together. The two present their idea for an entrance cadence to Dr. Lee who decides they will be used during the Classic. Devon helps the drumline prepare and patches up his relationship with Laila. Lee also tells Devon that he can guarantee him a full return to the band next year.|$|E
