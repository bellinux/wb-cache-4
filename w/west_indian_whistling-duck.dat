40|$|The <b>West</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Whistling-duck</b> is a {{sedentary}} species, {{endemic to}} the West Indies. Threatened by hunting, habitat destruction and introduced predators, {{the bird is}} classified as vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (lUCN) with fewer than 10, 000 individuals remaining. Despite its neaHhreatened status and wide range in the Caribbean, the biology of the species is poorly known. I studied the behaviour of the <b>West</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Whistling-duck</b> during three summers (1993 - 1995) on Long Island and Hog Cay, Bahamas, to provide baseline ecological data for conservation planning and development of future research priorities. Breeding on Long Island occurred from February through July, with nesting peaks in April and June. Nests were leaf-lined depressions on the ground, each containing 6 - 10 cream-coloured eggs. Both parents incubated, alternating 24 -hr shifts, and both cared for the young. In two cases, pair bonds lasted at least two years. Adults fed at an artificial feeding station and on natural wetlands; ducklings fed by diving and dabbling. Population means ranged from 513 to L 071 birds for 1994 and 1995, respectively. Adults had a yearly survival rate of 64 %. Brood size decreased between age-class Iand just-fledged juveniles...|$|E

40|$|Halogenated very {{short-lived}} substances (VSLSs) {{are naturally}} {{produced in the}} ocean and emitted to the atmosphere. When transported to the stratosphere, these compounds can have a significant influence on the ozone layer and climate. During a research cruise on RV Sonne in the subtropical and tropical <b>west</b> <b>Indian</b> Ocean in July and August 2014, we measured the VSLSs, methyl iodide (CH 3 I) {{and for the first}} time bromoform (CHBr 3) and dibromomethane (CH 2 Br 2), in surface seawater and the marine atmosphere to derive their emission strengths. Using the Lagrangian particle dispersion model FLEXPART with ERA-Interim meteorological fields, we calculated the direct contribution of observed VSLS emissions to the stratospheric halogen burden during the Asian summer monsoon. Furthermore, we compare the in situ calculations with the interannual variability of transport from a larger area of the <b>west</b> <b>Indian</b> Ocean surface to the stratosphere for July 2000 – 2015. We found that the <b>west</b> <b>Indian</b> Ocean is a strong source for CHBr 3 (910  pmol m− 2  h− 1), very strong source for CH 2 Br 2 (930  pmol m− 2  h− 1), and an average source for CH 3 I (460  pmol m− 2  h− 1). The atmospheric transport from the tropical <b>west</b> <b>Indian</b> Ocean surface to the stratosphere experiences two main pathways. On very short timescales, especially relevant for the shortest-lived compound CH 3 I (3. 5 days lifetime), convection above the Indian Ocean lifts oceanic air masses and VSLSs towards the tropopause. On a longer timescale, the Asian summer monsoon circulation transports oceanic VSLSs towards India and the Bay of Bengal, where they are lifted with the monsoon convection and reach stratospheric levels in the southeastern part of the Asian monsoon anticyclone. This transport pathway is more important for the longer-lived brominated compounds (17 and 150 days lifetime for CHBr 3 and CH 2 Br 2). The entrainment of CHBr 3 and CH 3 I from the <b>west</b> <b>Indian</b> Ocean to the stratosphere during the Asian summer monsoon is lower than from previous cruises in the tropical west Pacific Ocean during boreal autumn and early winter but higher than from the tropical Atlantic during boreal summer. In contrast, the projected CH 2 Br 2 entrainment was very high because of the high emissions during the <b>west</b> <b>Indian</b> Ocean cruise. The 16 -year July time series shows highest interannual variability for the shortest-lived CH 3 I and lowest for the longest-lived CH 2 Br 2. During this time period, a small increase in VSLS entrainment from the <b>west</b> <b>Indian</b> Ocean through the Asian monsoon to the stratosphere is found. Overall, this study confirms that the subtropical and tropical <b>west</b> <b>Indian</b> Ocean is an important source region of halogenated VSLSs, especially CH 2 Br 2, to the troposphere and stratosphere during the Asian summer monsoon...|$|R
