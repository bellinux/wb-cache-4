40|$|The {{wireless}} {{approach to}} the last mile access (<b>wireless</b> <b>local</b> <b>loop,</b> known as <b>WLL)</b> is becoming increasingly attractive to network operators and service providers since it offers a flexible and cost-effective solution to enable delivery of even broadband services to end customers. In this paper, a full-blown broadband WLL network is presented. The proposal {{is based on the}} OFDM-CDMA technique, to which an added dynamic reservation/request MAC protocol is proposed, fully exploiting the OFDM-CDMA platform. Central to our proposal is the support of different QoS profiles, in the context of QoS aware networks. As a case study, the explicit presentation of the IETF integrated services support over our WLL system is addressed. An extensive performance evaluation focused on the MAC layer is then reported. We prove that our scheme achieves high utilization efficiency, as well as a fair share of the available radio capacity, even in the presence of highly heterogeneous traffic mix. Delay performance is provided for both reference traffic models, as well as for measured IP and MPEG traffic traces offered to the system...|$|R

40|$|The <b>local</b> <b>loop</b> — {{the access}} network which connects {{customers}} {{to the core}} network — remains the last bastion of historical telecommunication operators. Even though competition in the <b>local</b> <b>loop</b> is limited today, some new access technologies may enable new operators to enter the <b>local</b> <b>loop.</b> Among these technologies, the <b>wireless</b> <b>local</b> <b>loop</b> {{seems to be the}} most promising. In this article, we try to evaluate whether it could viable for a new entrant to enter the <b>local</b> <b>loop</b> by building <b>wireless</b> <b>local</b> <b>loops.</b> We find that a <b>wireless</b> <b>local</b> <b>loop</b> entry strategy is characterized by (a) a strong technical progress, (b) a high level of uncertainty regarding the technology and the demand and (c) relatively high switching costs on the customer side.

The measurements consisted of having omnidirectional roof-top mounted transmitters with receivers inside various rooms in a variety of buildings. The extracted channel parameters are used in a channel simulation model and the output of this simulation is compared to the original data. The WLL channel was found to have very static characteristics. For a given set of measured impulse responses (IRs), the number of multi-path components (MPCs) and the amplitude distributions of these components do not vary significantly. The channel characteristics did however demonstrate sensitivity to movement at the receiver. The urban channel in particular is characterised by very large, late multi-path components, while the suburban environment demonstrates these to a lesser extent...|$|E
