5000|$|Dragonfly Seaplane: the {{addition}} of aluminium floats, strengthened attachment points, an extra cabin door and a <b>wing</b> <b>walkway,</b> increased the empty weight to 3,110 lb (1,410 kg) and lowered the maximum speed to 125 mph (200 km/h) ...|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{defining}} {{features of the}} hotel was its lobby, which incorporated a multistory atrium spanned by elevated walkways suspended from the ceiling. These steel, glass and concrete crossings connected the second, third and fourth floors {{between the north and}} south <b>wings.</b> The <b>walkways</b> were approximately 120 ft long and weighed approximately 64000 lb. [...] The fourth level walkway aligned directly above the second level walkway.|$|R
25|$|The wings were {{constructed}} using corrugated duralumin box spars and tubular rib assemblies, with a fabric covering and Frise ailerons {{on the upper}} and lower <b>wings.</b> Duralumin <b>walkways</b> were provided to allow ready access to the engines for maintenance purposes. The tail unit consisted of braced monoplane horizontal and vertical stabilizers; the tailplane was fitted with Flettner-type servo tabs for trimming on the Short Scylla which had the same wings and tail as the Kent.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, Loudoun County {{underwent}} {{its most}} extensive project in school history, an eighteen million dollar endeavor, {{which included the}} building of another auxiliary gym to replace the older one. The old auxiliary gymnasium turned into a new library, {{which used to be}} on the second floor. The library's area turned into a new section of classrooms, which eliminated the need for the six foundation based trailers. Additional classrooms were built adjacent to the science <b>wing.</b> Aerial <b>walkways</b> were built, connecting the separated second floors. The renovation was completed in late 2006.It is now one of 3 high schools in the Town of Leesburg.|$|R
50|$|The {{plan of the}} {{building}} has large rooms connected to stairhalls and other rooms by loggias and walkways on the two external faces of {{the building}}. This plan continues in the abutting <b>wing,</b> but with <b>walkways</b> located only along the arcaded, south western elevation, giving access to the rooms. Stairhalls are located near the principal entrance of the Main Building (1882), in the eastern {{corner of the building}} (1901) and centrally in the extension (1919). Two sets of concrete fire escape stairs and a lift are also found within the building.|$|R
50|$|The south wing {{connects to}} the public realm and {{includes}} a carport and two long, covered walkways. These walkways are separated by a massive stone wall and lead to public and service entries, respectively. The east wing {{of the house is}} connected to the living space by a north-facing internal gallery and houses a master bedroom suite. To the west, a kitchen, service spaces, and staff quarters are reached by a covered breezeway. In the northern <b>wing,</b> another open <b>walkway</b> passes along an exterior patio, leading to two guest rooms.|$|R
50|$|The wings were {{constructed}} using corrugated duralumin box spars and tubular rib assemblies, with a fabric covering and Frise ailerons {{on the upper}} and lower <b>wings.</b> Duralumin <b>walkways</b> were provided to allow ready access to the engines for maintenance purposes. The tail unit consisted of braced monoplane horizontal and vertical stabilizers; the tailplane was fitted with Flettner-type servo tabs for trimming on the Short Scylla which had the same wings and tail as the Kent. The anodised duralumin fuselage was mounted below the lower wing, with the planing bottom of the hull made of stainless steel (as on the Singapore II) with a transverse main step. The use of stainless steel reduced the frequency of land inspections of the hull. The bimetallic corrosion problems experienced on the Singapore II hull had been solved; Short Brothers became the first company to master the technique of building seaplane floats and flying boat hulls in this combination of metals.|$|R
40|$|When Great Foster Tries His Hand at Small Things [...] . Well, {{maybe not}} so small after all. When you drive into Miilheim-and-der-Ruhr, you {{are bound to}} be {{astonished}} by a hybrid building which seems to combine two eras. It is the headquarters of the agiplan Gruppe, and whoever visits {{it will be able to}} find out that wings can be added even to a block of concrete. What follows is a press release of the practice which created it. Foster and Partners’ new addition to the building, completed in May 1996, is one of several recent projects completed by the practice in the Ruhr since 1989 which seek to revitalise de¬pressed industrial areas and integrate new building into the older building fabric. The challenge for the agiplan project was how to extend its existing relatively modem 1970 s of¬fice building, designed by agiplan’s founder, to create new office areas with a central space between the two wings which could become the heart and focus of the company for both staff and the public. This 5200 sqm addition has a sweeping curved facade which gives agiplan a dynamic new public face and new en¬trance. The building’s four storeys are centred around a dra¬matic 18 -metre-high atrium which links the old and new <b>wings.</b> There are <b>walkways</b> across the atrium on each of the upper floors and a striking staircase connecting all floors. Its glazed roof allows daylight to penetrate the adjacent offices. The facade of the old wing, now on the atrium side, has been entirely removed and replaced by a glass balustrade mirror¬ing that of the new addition. The building brings together under one roof all the agip¬lan departments previously scattered around the region. It provides flexible and cellular offices, a gallery and library plus an atrium accommodating temporary exhibitions, staff cafeteria, and reception area. A new open-plan office space has been created on the ground floor of the old building to be used for ad-hoc meetings and studio work. The atrium has an oak parquet floor while the office areas have a vibrant blue carpet. The planning grid and floor heights of the new building match those of the old. Refurbishment has included exposing the underside of the impressive long-span curved concrete beams of the existing building. In the new addition, a half open, suspended ceiling provides acoustic insulation whilst still revealing parts of the concrete slab above. The building is naturally ventilated along its perimeter. Return air is extracted via the atrium space, which helps to reduce energy consumption. Solar glare and gain are mini¬mised with the use of sun protection glazing and double glazed panels with integral louvres in the cavity. On the north facade, transparent thermal insulation maximises daylight into the cellular offices behind. Foster and Partners were appointed architects in 1992. Construction began in January 1995 and was finished in July 1996...|$|R
