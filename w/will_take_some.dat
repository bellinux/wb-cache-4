5|$|Caprica-Six and Boomer {{are next}} shown conversing with Number Three. While the three move up a stairwell, {{explosives}} {{set by the}} resistance led by Samuel T. Anders (Michael Trucco) detonate, trapping Anders, Three, Boomer, and Caprica-Six in a parking garage. While Anders is originally shielded and hidden by the blast, Caprica-Six breaks her leg. Number Three offers to euthanize her, but Caprica-Six refuses as she suspects that Number Three will {{take the opportunity to}} box her. Shortly afterwards, the three find Anders who Number Three intends to kill before being stopped by Boomer and Caprica-Six. As Number Three goads them, Boomer and Caprica-Six understand that their unique view of humanity through their love for Baltar and Galen Tyrol gives them a perspective that makes them a threat to the Cylon status-quo. When Number Three attempts to kill Anders, she is killed by Caprica-Six who, along with Boomer, allow Anders to escape. Recognizing that it <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>some</b> time for Number Three to resurrect and report them, Caprica-Six and Boomer form a pact to change the Cylon perspective of humanity together before finally being rescued from the collapsed parking garage by the other Cylons.|$|E
25|$|A flooded suit {{may contain}} so much water that the diver cannot {{climb out of}} the water because of the weight and inertia. In this case it may be {{necessary}} to cut a small slit in the lower part of the leg to let water drain out as the diver rises out of the water. This <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>some</b> time, and agility will be seriously compromised. The damage should not be difficult to repair if the slit is cut with reasonable care.|$|E
25|$|In the film, where Harry and Hermione have {{travelled}} back in {{time and}} are hiding outside of Hagrid's hut, it is heavily implied that Dumbledore somehow knows that they are there, as he distracts the other characters at key moments or slows down the proceedings (such as by suggesting that he sign Buckbeak's execution order as well, then after Fudge agrees he says it <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>some</b> time as he has an extremely long name), which allows Harry and Hermione time to free Buckbeak unseen. In the book, Dumbledore merely comments that the executioner must sign the order, right before he is about to leave the cabin to execute Buckbeak.|$|E

500|$|Upon Nixon's death, {{almost all}} of the news {{coverage}} mentioned Watergate, but for the most part, the coverage was favorable to the former president. The Dallas Morning News stated, [...] "History ultimately should show that despite his flaws, he was one of our most farsighted chief executives." [...] This offended some; columnist Russell Baker complained of [...] "a group conspiracy to grant him absolution". Cartoonist Jeff Koterba of the Omaha World-Herald depicted History before a blank canvas, his subject Nixon, as America looks on eagerly.

500|$|According to Maiellaro, {{the series}} was pitched as a table read to the network. He jokingly stated that they {{accepted}} it after claiming that production costs would total [...] "five dollars and <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>some</b> of the paper sitting in the copier." [...] Maiellaro borrowed inspiration from surrealism and the films of David Lynch. He intended for the series to lack continuity starting from the pilot, but established a serial format after starting {{to work on the}} second episode. He had constructed an ending for the series as well as a detailed map of characters; however, the series finale concluded differently from planned. In November 2006, Maiellaro mentioned the possibility of continue the series with webisodes, and he wrote five additional scripts for ending the series, but finally, he only produced one webisode, entitled [...] "Enter the Sandmouse".|$|E

[...] Douglas Jardine rated him higher than any previous Yorkshire spinners, and Les Ames considered him the best left-arm spinner he had played against. Bradman wrote: [...] "Undoubtedly he w{{as one of the greatest}} slow left-handed spinners of all time. His record testifies to that.

Mayweather did not get a chance to fight Tszyu, but went on to fight Ricky Hatton (who defeated Tszyu and won his Ring light welterweight championship).

2500|$|Also {{known as}} a drive, this is the act of taking a pass from the dummy-half and running {{straight}} into the opposition's defensive line without looking to pass. Hit-ups are usually employed to gain low-risk metres early in the tackle-count, but a good hit-up can also result in a breach of the defensive line. It also tires defenders, who have to stop an on-rushing opponent by putting their bodies on the line. Defending players may be drawn in towards the player hitting the ball up {{in an effort to}} make a tackle, possibly leaving other parts of the defensive line weakened for other attackers should the ball-carrier manage to off-load the ball to a teammate. Forwards are usually used for taking hit-ups because of their greater size (often over 100kg) and strength, although most players on a team <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>some</b> hit-ups during a match. Most sets of 6 usually involve at least one hit-up to build a position from which to attack. A set of five hit-ups and a kick is known as one-out rugby, ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{official}} in France's Atomic Energy Commission {{reported that they}} estimated the blast was [...] "about or less than a kiloton" [...] and expressed uncertainty {{about whether or not}} the blast was actually nuclear. [...] There have been various large planned and unplanned non-nuclear explosions comparable in yield to small nuclear detonations, such as the U.S. [...] "Minor Scale" [...] explosion from 1985, which used conventional explosives to simulate a 4 kiloton detonation. According to the Washington Times anonymous U.S. intelligence sources speculated there [...] "was a seismic event that registered about 4 on the Richter scale, but it still isn't clear if it was a nuclear test. You can get that kind of seismic reading from high explosives". The Wall Street Journal explains that this blast was equivalent to the explosive force of about US$100,000 worth of ammonium nitrate. [...] International experts have said that it <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>some</b> time to confirm whether it was a successful nuclear test, as North Korea claimed, or an unsuccessful one ("fizzle"), or perhaps not even a nuclear test at all.|$|E

[...] It is a compromise between these three – a sort of eclectic school, a selection of the merits of each one. [...] I myself will make an attempt to produce a grand opera of this new school. ... Yes, it will be an historical work, and it is the dream of my life. [...] I do not believe in opera based on gods and myths. [...] That is the fault of the German school. [...] It is metaphysical music – it is philosophy. [...] What we want are plots that give rise to characters of flesh and blood, with human emotions and human passions.

2500|$|In 2013 the EU {{adopted a}} binding {{directive}} {{according to which}} the Israeli government {{will be required to}} state in any future agreements with the EU that settlements in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem are outside the state of Israel. The directive partially implements an earlier EU foreign ministers' declaration [...] that [...] "all agreements between the state of Israel and the EU must unequivocally and explicitly indicate their inapplicability to the territories occupied by Israel in 1967". The guidelines prohibit the issuing of EU grants, funding, prizes or scholarships to Israeli entities unless a settlement exclusion clause is included. Israeli institutions and bodies situated across the pre-1967 Green Line will be automatically ineligible. The EU directive is similar to the one signed between the United States and Israel in 1972 whereby Israel undertook, in exchange for science funding, to restrict the projects within the 1967 borders. The guidelines do not restrict grants issued by individual EU member states. In advance of the publication of the Guidelines, there was, in Israel, a political and media storm. News Media have suggested Israel <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>some</b> action against the EU. Maja Kocijancic, spokeswoman for EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, has said: [...] "The EU is concerned by reports in the Israeli media that the Israeli Minister of Defense has announced a number of restrictions affecting EU activities supporting the Palestinian people. We have not received any official communication from the Israeli authorities. Our delegations on the spot are seeking urgent clarifications".|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} month, Kathy {{is shocked}} when Gavin appears in her home. She threatens {{to call the}} police, but he asks her to pass on a message to Sharon, revealing {{that he has been}} on holiday with her and Dennis, but she left. Dot Branning (June Brown) then arrives, and eventually she remembers Gavin from his childhood in Walford, saying that he was a troublemaker who stole money from Ethel Skinner (Gretchen Franklin), and warns Kathy off getting involved. Gavin simply says he wants the opportunity to be a good father and grandfather, and cries when he remembers that he was unwanted by his own mother. After Dot leaves, Kathy realises that Gavin does not like being on his own and promises to pass on the messaage. Before he leaves, he kisses Kathy as a thank you, saying he misses her. Kathy speaks to Sharon, who reveals that she left the holiday because Gavin hit Dennis. Sharon meets Gavin who says he did it out of love but Sharon wants nothing to do with him. Later, Sharon discovers that Gavin has collected Dennis from school and given him a mobile phone. She meets Gavin and offers him £100,000 to leave forever, revealing that she is selling her half of her bar to fund this. Gavin asks her for another chance but she rejects him and he leaves. After Sharon tells Gavin it <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>some</b> weeks to get the money, Gavin sees Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas) and her family and concludes that they must be wealthy. Gavin blackmails Clauedtte, threatening to reveal a secret from her past. Claudette attempts to pay Gavin with sex, but afterwards he says it is not a payment and asks how Claudette killed her husband, Henry. When he demands more money, she strikes him over the head with a candelabra. She believes he is dead and takes him to the basement, and when her son Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood) arrives, she lies about the circumstances, but when Gavin escapes, her lies are revealed to Vincent. Gavin returns to Claudette's home and meets Vincent, who says Claudette has left the country. Gavin says he will track her down, so Vincent offers to pay off the money Gavin claims she owes him. Sharon then meets Gavin and gives him the money from her sale of her bar (to Vincent), and he asks for a reconciliation but she rejects him. He meets Margaret, saying she will get her share of the money, and states that Sharon is now dead to him as he has another plan, which Margaret calls [...] "insane".|$|E
