25|$|It was {{probably}} this work which contained {{a story about}} souls, <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> told that there were once spirits {{who lived in a}} state of bliss, but having committed a crime (the nature of which is unknown) they were punished by being forced to become mortal beings, reincarnated from body to body.

25|$|Although men {{and women}} lie at equal frequencies, {{men are more likely}} to lie in order to please {{themselves}} while {{women are more likely to}} lie to please others.
