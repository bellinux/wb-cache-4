5|$|In the United States and the European Union, {{since the}} early 1990s {{regulations}} {{have been in place}} that are designed to prevent shellfish from contaminated waters entering the food chain. This has meant that there is sometimes a shortage of regulated shellfish, with consequent higher prices. This has led to illegal harvesting and sale of shellfish on the black market, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> health hazard.|$|E

He uses seasonal imagery to set up his atmosphere, which he continues to use in line three, where we also encounter an allusion to the myth of Philomela, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> poetic name for the nightingale.|$|E
5|$|Inquisitive and bold, {{especially}} {{in the presence of}} food, the silvertip shark is regarded as potentially dangerous to humans. Often, several Silvertip sharks will rush up from deep water to inspect divers when they first enter the water, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> very intimidating experience, as the sharks may approach quite close. This species has also been known to circle or pursue divers. In one experiment involving bait, a large silvertip shark tore the leg off a dummy dressed in SCUBA gear, demonstrating that this species is capable of inflicting lethal injuries. As of 2008, the International Shark Attack File listed four provoked attacks attributable to this species, none of them fatal.|$|E

5|$|There is no {{requirement}} that other comorbid conditions (such as ADHD or OCD) be present, {{but if a}} physician believes {{that there may be}} another condition present that could explain tics, tests may be ordered as necessary to rule out that condition. An example of this is when diagnostic confusion between tics and seizure activity exists, which would call for an EEG, or if there are symptoms that indicate an MRI to rule out brain abnormalities. TSH levels can be measured to rule out hypothyroidism, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> cause of tics. Brain imaging studies are not usually warranted. In teenagers and adults presenting with a sudden onset of tics and other behavioral symptoms, a urine drug screen for cocaine and stimulants might be necessary. If a family history of liver disease is present, serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels can rule out Wilson's disease. Most cases are diagnosed by merely observing a history of tics.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{controversial}} issues regarding {{the construction of}} expressways. The main issue is the increase of toll rates, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> huge burden especially for residents of Kuala Lumpur and the surrounding Klang Valley conurbation.|$|E

25|$|Use {{of other}} {{emergency}} air {{sources such as}} octopus second stage, integrated DV/BC inflator units, bailout cylinders etc. also requires the learning of appropriate skills. These procedures are as complex as buddy breathing {{up to the point}} of sharing, and the fundamental difference is that the donor and recipient are not required to alternate breathing with a period when no air is available, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> big advantage. These alternatives to buddy breathing also require substantial learning and reinforcement to be reliable in a stressful situation.|$|E
25|$|Asian second-generation {{immigrants}}, {{like their}} Hispanic counterparts, {{tend to be}} bilingual. Children of Asian immigrants are likely to lose proficiency in their parents' native language while maintaining an emotional attachment to their family and heritage, which helps them develop their identity. While second generation Asian immigrants strive {{for the middle class}} white status, as many of their parents do, they develop a sensitivity to issues of race and ethnicity, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> major factor in the process of assimilation.|$|E

25|$|Mariners' {{compasses}} {{can have}} two or more magnets permanently attached to a compass card, which moves freely on a pivot. A lubber line, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> marking on the compass bowl or a small fixed needle, indicates the ship's heading on the compass card. Traditionally the card is divided into thirty-two points (known as rhumbs), although modern compasses are marked in degrees rather than cardinal points. The glass-covered box (or bowl) contains a suspended gimbal within a binnacle. This preserves the horizontal position.|$|E
25|$|Promotion is {{effected}} {{by turning the}} piece over after it moves, revealing the name of its promoted rank. Promoting a piece {{has the effect of}} changing how that piece moves. See below. For example, promoting a kirin turns it into a lion, and thereafter it behaves exactly like the original lion, even for the lion-trading rules. (<b>Which</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> reason to defer promotion of a kirin.) A rook obtained by promoting a gold differs from an original rook, though, by that the latter can still promote (to dragon horse), while the former cannot.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{widespread}} use of pingers along coastlines effectively excludes cetaceans such as porpoises from prime habitat and resources. Cetaceans which are extremely sensitive to noise are effectively being driven from their preferred coastal habitats by the use of acoustic devices. In poorer quality habitat, harbour porpoises are subjected to increased competition for resources. This situation is recognized as range contraction <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> result of climate change, anthropogenic activity, or population decline. Large scale range contractions are considered indicative of impending extinction. A similar form of deterrent is noise pollution originating from vessel traffic.|$|E

25|$|In 1992, {{the program}} began {{as a way to}} {{preserve}} and promote documentary heritage, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> single document, a collection, a holding or an archival fonds that is deemed to be of such significance as to transcend the boundaries of time and culture. This recorded memory reflects the diversity of languages, people, and cultures. UNESCO, the world agency responsible {{for the protection of the}} world's cultural and natural heritage, realized the need to protect such fragile yet important component of cultural heritage. To this end, the Memory of the World Programme was established with the aim of preserving and digitizing humanity's documentary heritage.|$|E
25|$|Hemolytic anemia* {{is a type}} of {{regenerative}} anemia {{found in}} dogs characterized by destruction of the red blood cell. The most important type is immune-mediated hemolytic anemia, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> primary disease or secondary to cancer, infection, drugs, or vaccinations. Antibodies are present on the cell surface, leading to lysis and severe anemia. Other causes of hemolytic lesion include hypophosphatemia, exposure to toxins such as lead, infections such as ehrlichiosis or babesiosis, and rarely, neonatal isoerythrolysis. The behavioral condition pica, especially when involving the eating of concrete dust, tile grout, or sand, may be a sign of hemolytic anemia, indicating the need for a complete blood count to investigate a possible diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|Effective {{use of any}} {{alternate}} {{air source}} requires competence in the associated skill set. The procedures for receiving air from another diver or from one's own equipment are most effective and least {{likely to result in}} a life-threatening incident if well trained {{to the extent that they}} do not distract the diver from other essential matters. A major difference from buddy breathing is that the diver using a redundant alternative air source need not alternate breathing with the donor, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> substantial advantage in many circumstances. There is a further significant advantage when the alternate air source is carried by the diver using it, in that it is not necessary to locate the buddy before it is available, but this comes at the cost of extra equipment.|$|E

50|$|As seen in {{the table}} above, the {{generation}} 1 OLEV lacks a realistic margin for error. The lower current means a smaller magnetic field and requires the secondary coil to be {{very close to the}} floor, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> issue while driving. Moreover, if the primary and secondary coils are vertically misaligned by a distance over 3mm, the power efficiency drops greatly.|$|R
25|$|This {{technique}} {{is also used}} for detection of illicit drugs in urine. The most common method of drug detection is an immunoassay. This method is much more convenient. However, convenience comes {{at the cost of}} specificity and coverage {{of a wide range of}} drugs. As HPLC is a method of determining (and possibly increasing) purity, using HPLC alone in evaluating concentrations of drugs is somewhat insufficient. With this, HPLC in this context is often performed in conjunction with mass spectrometry. Using liquid chromatography instead of gas chromatography in conjunction with MS circumvents the necessity for derivitizing with acetylating or alkylation agents, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> burdensome extra step. This technique has been used to detect a variety of agents like doping agents, drug metabolites, glucuronide conjugates, amphetamines, opioids, cocaine, BZDs, ketamine, LSD, cannabis, and pesticides Performing HPLC in conjunction with Mass spectrometry reduces the absolute need for standardizing HPLC experimental runs.|$|E
25|$|Although bite mark {{analysis}} {{has been used}} in legal proceedings since 1870, it remains a controversial topic due to a variety of factors. DeVore and Barbenel and Evans have shown that the accuracy of a bite mark on skin is limited at best. Skin is not a good medium for dental impressions; it is liable to have a number of irregularities present before the imprint that could cause distortion. Also, bite marks can be altered through stretching, movement or a changing environment during and after the actual bite. Furthermore, the level of distortion tends to increase after the bite mark was made. Both studies suggest that for the bite mark to be accurately analyzed, the body must be examined in exactly the same position it was in when the bite occurred <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> difficult if not an impossible task to accomplish. Bite mark distortion can rarely be quantified. Therefore, bite marks found at the scene are often analyzed under the assumption that they have undergone minimal distortion. Only limited research has been done in trying to quantify the level of distortion of a bite mark on human skin since the 1970s. The lack of research may largely be {{due to the fact that}} such studies are difficult to organize and are very expensive.|$|E
25|$|Square {{shoulder}} spades: Square shoulder spade coins have square shoulders, {{a straight}} or slightly curving foot, and three parallel {{lines on the}} obverse and reverse. They are found in quantities of up to several hundreds in the area corresponding to the Royal Domain of Zhou (south Hebei and north Henan). Archaeological evidence dates them to the early Spring and Autumn period, around 650 BC onwards. The inscriptions on these coins usually consist of one character, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> number, a cyclical character, a place name, or {{the name of a}} clan. The possibility that some inscriptions are the names of merchants has not been entertained. The crude writing is that of the artisans who made the coins, not the more careful script of the scholars who wrote the votive inscriptions on bronzes. The style of writing is consistent with that of the middle Zhou period. Over 200 inscriptions are known; many have not been fully deciphered. The characters {{can be found on the}} left or the right of the central line and are sometimes inverted or retrograde. The alloy of these coins is typically 80% copper, 15% lead, and 5% tin. They are found in hoards of hundreds, rather than thousands, sometimes tied together in bundles. Although there is no mention in the literature of their purchasing power, it is clear that they were not small change.|$|E
