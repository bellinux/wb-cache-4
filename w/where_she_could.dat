5|$|Hounds of Love was {{released}} in 1985. Because of {{the high cost of}} hiring studio space for her previous album, she built a private studio near her home, <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> work at her own pace. Hounds of Love ultimately topped the charts in the UK, knocking Madonna's Like a Virgin from the number-one position.|$|E
5|$|The {{couple had}} three {{children}} together: Eric, Karen, and Mark. In June 1961, daughter Karen {{was diagnosed with a}} malignant tumor of the middle part of her brain stem; X-ray treatment slowed its growth, but her health deteriorated to the point <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> no longer walk or talk. Two-year-old Karen died of pneumonia, related to her weakened health, on January 28, 1962.|$|E
5|$|In March 1865, {{the river}} {{began to rise}} and Missouri was able to leave the Shreveport area for the first time. She reached Alexandria, Louisiana on 8 April and {{anchored}} <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> defend the town. Captain Carter surrendered the ship to Union forces on 3 June, the last Confederate ironclad to surrender. After her armor was removed, Missouri was sold at public auction on 29 November.|$|E

50|$|Theresa wed Alistair Crane on October 3, 2005 {{after he}} promised to help her get back her {{daughter}} Jane, and because she wanted access to the Crane mansion itself, <b>where</b> <b>she</b> believed <b>she</b> <b>could</b> uncover information that would clear her name in regards to her wedding day tabloid scandal.|$|R
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1756, as George {{approached}} his eighteenth birthday, the King offered him a grand establishment at St James's Palace, but George refused the offer, guided by his mother and her confidant, Lord Bute, who would later serve as Prime Minister. George's mother, now the Dowager Princess of Wales, preferred to keep George at home <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> imbue him with her strict moral values.|$|E
5|$|On 3 April, {{the ship}} was {{transferred}} to the island of Syros, <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> support the seaplanes of No. 62 Wing of the Royal Air Force (RAF) on anti-submarine patrols; part of the former No. 2 Wing RNAS redesignated when the RNAS and the Royal Flying Corps were merged to form the RAF. Ark Royal was transferred to Piraeus in October and was still there when the Armistice of Mudros with Turkey was signed on 31 October. The ship joined the Allied fleet that occupied Constantinople after the surrender.|$|E
5|$|Prince of Wales {{was forced}} to {{disengage}} {{by a combination of}} damage from German hits and mechanical failures in her guns and turrets after Hood was sunk. Despite these problems, she had hit Bismarck three times. One of these hits contaminated {{a good portion of the}} ship's fuel supply and subsequently caused her to steer for safety in occupied France <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be repaired. Bismarck was temporarily able to evade detection, but was later spotted and sunk by the British on 27 May.|$|E

60|$|Beatrice {{walked quickly}} along the cliff till {{she came in}} sight of Jones's farm. From <b>where</b> <b>she</b> stood <b>she</b> <b>could</b> make out a great crowd of men, and even, when the wind turned towards her, catch the noise of shouting. Presently she heard a sound like the report of a gun, saw the crowd break up in violent confusion, and then cluster {{together}} again in a dense mass.|$|R
50|$|Police at {{the time}} did not rule out foul play. They said the {{investigation}} into forensics and determining how Barnes died and how she got to a location 45 miles from <b>where</b> <b>she</b> disappeared <b>could</b> take weeks.|$|R
5|$|USS Canonicus was a single-turret monitor {{built for}} the United States Navy during the American Civil War, the lead ship of her class. The ship {{spent most of her}} first year in service {{stationed}} up the James River, <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> support operations against Richmond and defend against a sortie by the Confederate ironclads of the James River Squadron. She engaged Confederate artillery batteries during the year and later participated in both attacks on Fort Fisher, defending the approaches to Wilmington, North Carolina, from December 1864 to January 1865.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{many women}} of her era, Stanton was {{formally}} educated. She attended Johnstown Academy {{until the age}} of 16, where she studied Latin, Greek, mathematics, religion, science, French, and writing. At the Academy, she enjoyed being in co-educational classes <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> compete intellectually and academically with boys her age and older. She won several academic awards and honors, including the award for Greek language.|$|E
5|$|Kawada's musical style mainly fuses {{rock with}} trance. When Kawada debuted in 2001, she {{originally}} {{felt that the}} music she earned in her career was pocket money. She also felt happy {{that she could be}} based in Sapporo <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be close to her family and friends, as well as to I've Sound who she felt was like a second family to her. After Kotoko made her major debut in 2004, I've Sound management began discussing the possibility of Kawada making a major debut. At first, she was hesitant because she felt that she would be thrust into the spotlight, but eventually she accepted the idea. For the first ten years of her career, she always felt that she was a beginner, but this began to change when younger singers made their debuts and began to treat her as an older sister.|$|E
50|$|January 21, 1994 {{was a major}} {{turning point}} as she, unfortunately, had a {{collision}} with a taxi in Lagos when crossing the road. In her words, she “crossed the road and hit a car”. This resulted in major surgery which severely affected her ability to dance. She was in between singing and dancing {{doing a lot of}} background vocals for other musicians. Music to her was static in comparison with painting, sculpture, theatre, and dancing <b>where</b> <b>she</b> felt <b>she</b> <b>could</b> fuel her energy to its fullest.|$|R
60|$|She was {{watching}} the procession with interest, yet somewhat idly, when she caught sight of me, whom, from <b>where</b> <b>she</b> stood, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> scarcely have seen before. Of a sudden her face grew doubtful and troubled, like to that of one who has just received some hurt. She saw the ornament about my neck. She turned pale and had she not gripped {{the arm of the}} man beside her, would, I think, have fallen. Then her eyes caught mine, and Fate had us in its net.|$|R
50|$|Before {{completing}} {{high school}} at 16, Kundu would help her father, a computer engineer, take apart computers. This influenced her studies at Stanford University, <b>where</b> <b>she</b> graduated with a bachelor's and master's degree in electrical engineering, and served as {{editor in chief of}} the university's undergraduate research journal. During this time, a class on medical imaging led Kundu into the medical field, <b>where</b> <b>she</b> believed <b>she</b> <b>could</b> use her expertise to diagnose patients faster. Kundu enrolled in the Medical Scientist Training Program conducted by Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh. Prior to her doctoral program, Kundu also trained as an Indian classical dancer and performed at Madison Square Garden.|$|R
5|$|On 11 October 2012, a {{panel of}} Pakistani and British doctors decided to move Yousafzai to the Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology in Rawalpindi. Mumtaz Khan, a doctor, {{said that she had}} a 70% chance of survival. Interior Minister Rehman Malik said that Yousafzai would be moved to Germany, <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> receive the best medical treatment, as soon as she was stable enough to travel. A team of doctors would travel with her, and the {{government}} would bear the expenditures of her treatment. Doctors reduced Yousafzai's sedation on 13 October, and she moved all four limbs.|$|E
5|$|With {{the loss}} of their station on Bermuda, Beebe and Elswyth gave up on their {{compromise}} of finding a research station where they could both be happy. Elswyth, who was most content in temperate environments, began searching for a home in New England <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> continue her writing. Meanwhile, Beebe began searching for a new tropical research station to replace Kartabo, which had fallen victim to deforestation just like Kalacoon before it. Beebe eventually helped Elswyth purchase a small farm near Wilmington, Vermont, where he visited her frequently. Elswyth explained in a magazine interview that she was uncomfortable on Beebe's expeditions, so {{the two of them had}} agreed that they would keep their careers separate from their private lives.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the attack}} on convoy SLS 64, Admiral Hippers fuel stocks were running low. She {{therefore}} returned to Brest on 15 February. British bombers were regularly attacking the port, however, and the Kriegsmarine therefore decided Admiral Hipper should return to Germany, <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be better protected. Before the ship could leave, damage caused to the ship's hull by wrecks in the harbor had to be repaired. On 15 March, the ship slipped out of Brest, unobserved, and passed through the Denmark Strait eight days later. While en route, Admiral Hipper stopped to refuel in Bergen. By 28 March, the cruiser was docked in Kiel, having made the entire journey without being detected by the British. Upon arrival, the ship went into the Deutsche Werke shipyard for an extensive overhaul, which lasted for seven months. After completion of the refit, Admiral Hipper conducted sea trials in the Baltic before putting into Gotenhafen on 21 December for some minor refitting. In January 1942, the ship had her steam turbines overhauled at the Blohm & Voss shipyard; a degaussing coil was fitted to the ship's hull during this overhaul. By March, the ship was again fully operational.|$|E

60|$|More days--and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{speak to}} the nurse at her bedside; <b>she</b> <b>could</b> answer the {{questions}} of an elderly man, who knew far more about her than she knew about herself, and who {{told her he was}} Mr. Merrick, the doctor; <b>she</b> <b>could</b> sit up in bed, supported by pillows, wondering what had happened to her, and <b>where</b> <b>she</b> was; <b>she</b> <b>could</b> feel a growing curiosity about that quiet voice, which still asked after her, morning, noon, and night, {{on the other side of}} the door.|$|R
5|$|Manning was {{ultimately}} charged with 22 offenses, including aiding the enemy, {{which was the}} most serious charge and could {{have resulted in a}} death sentence. She was held at the Marine Corps Brig, Quantico in Virginia, from July 2010 to April 2011, under Prevention of Injury status—which entailed de facto solitary confinement and other restrictions that caused domestic and international concern—before being transferred to the Joint Regional Correctional Facility at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> interact with other detainees. She pleaded guilty in February 2013 to 10 of the charges. The trial on the remaining charges began on June 3, 2013, and on July 30 she was convicted of 17 of the original charges and amended versions of four others, but was acquitted of aiding the enemy. She was sentenced to serve a 35-year sentence at the maximum-security U.S. Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth. On January 17, 2017, President Barack Obama commuted Manning's sentence to nearly seven years of confinement dating from her arrest on May 27, 2010 by military authorities.|$|E
5|$|This {{proved a}} turning point in Eleanor and Sara's long-running struggle, and as Eleanor's public role grew, she {{increasingly}} broke from Sara's control. Tensions between Sara and Eleanor over her new political friends rose {{to the point that the}} family constructed a cottage at Val-Kill, in which Eleanor and her guests lived when Franklin and the children were away from Hyde Park. Eleanor herself named the place Val-Kill, loosely translated as waterfall-stream from the Dutch language common to the original European settlers of the area. Franklin encouraged Eleanor to develop this property as a place <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> implement some of her ideas for work with winter jobs for rural workers and women. Each year, when Eleanor held a picnic at Val-Kill for delinquent boys, her granddaughter Eleanor Roosevelt Seagraves assisted her. She was close to Eleanor throughout her life. Seagraves concentrated her career as an educator and librarian on keeping alive many of the causes Eleanor began and supported.|$|E
5|$|Corder {{wished to}} keep his {{relationship}} with Marten a secret, but {{she gave birth to}} their child in 1827 at the age of 25, and she was apparently keen that she and Corder should marry. The child died (later reports suggested that it may have been murdered), but Corder apparently still intended to marry Marten. That summer, in the presence of her stepmother, Ann Marten, he suggested that she meet him at the Red Barn, from where he proposed that they elope to Ipswich. Corder claimed that he had heard rumours that the parish officers were going to prosecute Maria for having bastard children. He initially suggested that they elope on the Wednesday evening, but later decided to delay until the Thursday evening. On Thursday, he was again delayed; his brother falling ill is mentioned as the reason in some sources, although most claim that all his brothers were dead by this time. On Friday, 18 May 1827, he appeared at the Martens' cottage during the day and, according to Ann Marten, he told Maria that they must leave at once, as he had heard that the local constable had obtained a warrant to prosecute her (no warrant had been obtained, but it is not known if Corder was lying or was mistaken). Maria was worried that she could not leave in broad daylight, but Corder told her that she should dress in men's clothing so as to avert suspicion, and he would carry her things to the barn <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> meet him and change before they continued on to Ipswich.|$|E

60|$|Those poor {{girls were}} in an agony. Everybody in the church was looking at our pew and smiling. We all felt that we were terribly disgraced; but we could do nothing.

5|$|In September 1858, the Brazier family accused Mrs Mole, a labourer's {{wife who}} lived in East Thorpe, Essex, of bewitching their {{daughter}} and livestock. Hoping to have the bewitchment removed, they consulted a local cunning-man known as Burrell, who lived at nearby Copford. When Burrell was unable to help, they proceeded to consult Murrell, inviting {{him to come to}} East Thorpe to remove the curse. Murrell's planned visit generated much anticipation in East Thorpe's community, with the local rector attempting to calm the situation by requesting that the parish relieving officer move the allegedly bewitched girl to the union-house, <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be examined by the parish surgeon. Nevertheless, the officer of the poor refused to comply, asserting that Murrell's arrival would correct the problem. Persisting, the rector applied to the local magistrate to ensure that police would be in the village on the day of Murrell's arrival, to ensure that the crowd would be controlled. On the day itself, a crowd of two hundred had gathered, and proceeded to Mrs Mole's house with the intention of carrying out folk justice; concerned by this illegal behaviour, the rector stood outside of her door and forbade the crowd entry, prior to police arriving and dispersing the mob.|$|E

50|$|Mrs Christine Horst and {{two other}} {{employees}} claimed unfair dismissal after being told they were redundant, and failing applications for other positions with High Table Ltd. High Table argued they were redundant because their workplace, which was factually always from 10am to 4pm at City firm Hill Samuel, no longer needed their ‘silver service’ waitressing after the supply contract was renegotiated. She argued that because the staff handbook contained a flexibility clause that said <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be transferred ‘within reasonable daily travelling distance’ <b>where</b> possible <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not be redundant.|$|R
