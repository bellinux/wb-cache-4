We had largely all the elements of the episode in place and Fox called and said, 'Hey, how would you guys feel about if <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> to have some musical element in the show?

We turned their request into what felt like a positive for us and really deepened and sort of blew the episode out even further in the direction we were already taking it".|$|E

[...] During production of [...] "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes," [...] Slattery admitted he was unsure of whether to continue working on Mad Men. [...] "I was on the fence a little bit, even while shooting it. And I think Matt finally was like, 'Look man, we’re not jerking you around here. We’re serious about this and I’ve really thought this out. I promise you this will be a great character {{and it will be a}} big part of the show.'" ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{episode was}} {{originally}} called [...] "Overture", but was later changed to [...] "Brown Betty" [...] {{as a reference}} to Walter's marijuana habit.
