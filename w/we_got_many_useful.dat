40|$|Methods for {{alignment}} of protein sequences typically measure similarity by using substitution matrix with scores for all possible exchanges of one amino acid with another. Although widely used, the matrices derived from homologous sequence segments, such as Dayhoff's PAM matrices and Henikoff's BLOSUM matrices, are not specific for protein conformation identification. Using a different approach, <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>many</b> amino acid segment blocks. For each of them, the protein secondary structure is identical.

When learners join {{in a community of}} this classified structure, they will be provided with some communication tools and personal services to encourage them to interact with other schoolmates and teachers. The effective operation has been found by means of the cooperative learning activities and sharing resources with each other. In order to share the personal information among different kinds of learning software and web programs, we use the sockets and cookies mechanism, which is applied to applications and internet programs respectively, to confirm user’s authentication. Finally, we introduce our prototypical site – EduCities, which is designed by applying the above concepts. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>many</b> positive reflections and found some issues worthy to research...|$|R

Many of these surveys consist of {{a long list of}} questions which is time consuming for the respondents. As part of the FP 6 HILAS project a shorter survey has been developed, which aimed at getting a high response rate. The survey should give insights into employees’ views about safety, safety culture and climate. It is aimed at identifying issues for improving safety performance in rapidly developing airlines. The survey has been conducted in a globally operating aviation organisation. 1921 employees responded, which corresponds to 68 % of the workforce. Each set of statements had a comment field to explain or illustrate answers. In addition to quantified scores to assess the employees’ perceptions, <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>many</b> and valuable comments.

Here, we aimed to evaluate genetic selection among three {{different types of}} sheep breed: two well-known commercial mutton breeds and one indigenous Chinese breed. We first combined locus-specific branch lengths and di statistical methods to detect candidate regions targeted by selection in the three different populations. The {{results showed that the}} genetic distances reached at least medium divergence for each pairwise combination. We found these two methods were highly correlated, and identified many growth-related candidate genes undergoing artificial selection. For production traits, APOBR and FTO are associated with body mass index. For meat traits, ALDOA, STK 32 B and FAM 190 A are related to marbling. For reproduction traits, CCNB 2 and SLC 8 A 3 affect oocyte development. We also found two well-known genes, GHR (which affects meat production and quality) and EDAR (associated with hair thickness) were associated with German mutton merino sheep. Furthermore, four genes (POL, RPL 7, MSL 1 and SHISA 9) were associated with pre-weaning gain in our previous genome-wide association study. Our results indicated that combine locus-specific branch lengths and di statistical approaches can reduce the searching ranges for specific selection.

6000|$|At {{the end of}} {{two months}} we had never [...] "struck" [...] a pocket.

We prospected around Angel's Camp, in Calaveras county, during three weeks, but had no success. Then we wandered on foot among the mountains, sleeping under the trees at night, for the weather was mild, but still we remained as centless as the last rose of summer. That is a poor joke, but it is in pathetic harmony with the circumstances, since we were so poor ourselves. In accordance with the custom of the country, our door had always stood open and our board welcome to tramping miners--they drifted along nearly every day, dumped their paust shovels by the threshold and took [...] "pot luck" [...] with us--and now on our own tramp we never found cold hospitality.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the reasons}} we did all the remixes was that the initial 12-inch version of 'Relax' {{contained}} something called 'The Sex Mix', which was 16 minutes long and didn't even contain a song.

The {{stranger}} hauled up to speak us, as soon as we were seen. There was a good deal of discussion about this vessel, as she drew near, between Captain Digges and his chief-mate. The latter said he knew the vessel, and that it was an Indiaman out of Philadelphia, called the Ganges, a sort of sister craft to our own ship; while the former maintained, if it were the Ganges at all, she was so altered as scarcely to be recognised. As <b>we</b> <b>got</b> near, the stranger threw a shot under our fore-foot, and showed an American pennant and ensign. Getting a better look at her, <b>we</b> <b>got</b> so <b>many</b> signs of a vessel-of-war in our neighbour, as to think it wisest to heave-to, when the other vessel passed under our stern, tacked, and lay with her head-yards aback, a little on our weather-quarter. As she drew to windward, we saw her stern, which had certain national emblems, but no name on it. This settled the matter. She was a man-of-war, and she carried the American flag! Such a thing did not exist a few months before, when we left home, and Captain Digges was burning with impatience to know more. He was soon gratified.|$|R
