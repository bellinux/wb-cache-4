2500|$|... "It {{was a total}} {{surprise}} when [...] manager Reg Freeman pulled me aside at the training ground to tell me of The Blues' interest. I was so excited that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the training session I lost concentration and went sliding off onto the gravel edge. When I met up with Blues officials later that day I had both my hands bandaged and {{found it hard to}} sign the contract!" ...|$|E
2500|$|On May 24, 2011, McKinney {{appeared}} on state-run television in Libya {{and stated that}} United States participation in military intervention in the 2011 Libyan civil war was [...] "...not what {{the people of the}} United States stand for and it's not what African-Americans stand for". Also on Memri-TV, McKinney stated [...] "On a previous visit to Libya, I was able to learn about the Green Book, and the form of direct democracy that is advocated in The Green Book. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the United States, I spoke with Senator Mike Gravel, who was a presidential candidate, just like me, in 2008, because he too is pushing a form of direct democracy for the United States. That is because the government of the United States fails to represent the interests of the American people now. The government is here, and the people of the US are here." ...|$|E
2500|$|In New York, Stuart {{sought to}} return to stage acting on Broadway. [...] "I {{wanted to be a}} theater actress," [...] she said, [...] "but I thought {{it would be easier to}} get to New York and the theater if I had a name than if I just walked the streets as a little girl from California. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> New York with {{somewhat}} of a name, they didn't want movie actresses." [...] Stuart was, however, welcomed into summer stock theater on the east coast, and performed in Man and Superman, The Animal Kingdom, The Night of January 16th, Accent on Youth, Route 101, Mr. and Mrs. North, The Pursuit of Happiness, Here Today, Sailor Beware and was Emily to Thornton Wilder’s Stage Manager—under Wilder’s own direction—in Our Town. But for two years, as many readings, lunches and cocktail parties as she attended, no director, producer or writer (not even Sheekman) gave Stuart a role on Broadway.|$|E

6000|$|... "Gold is {{generally}} useful, isn't it?" [...] smiled Dane. [...] "It {{would help me}} to earn {{a little more than}} my bread <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to England." ...|$|R
2500|$|Listed as a 6'5" [...] forward/center in 2000, Turner was a 26-year-old rookie with Dungannon. At first, Turner didn't {{know what}} to make of Ireland. He was struck by the locals' {{hospitality}} and intrigued by the country's history, but he was initially unimpressed by the amenities and customs. Turner explained, [...] "I was still on my spoiled American high horse. 'The locker rooms are too small. I’ve got to carry my own bag. We don't practise enough. They want me to coach the local kids when I just want to play.' But <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> America for the Christmas break, I realised that I had to take my blinders off or I'd end up just like my friends at home, doing nothing or working in a job they hated." [...] He came to embrace the lifestyle and it showed on and off the court. However, while he was considered 'prolific' and made a significant contribution every game, he often lacked support in offensive situations. In a 92–74 loss to Tralee Tigers in January 2001, Turner had a 49-point effort.|$|E
60|$|Be {{it enough}} to say, that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Browndown, Lucilla went with me.|$|E
60|$|By the way, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> my lodging on that eventful day, the miller's wife met {{me at the}} door.|$|E
6000|$|... "All excellent--all too good," [...] {{answered}} Olifaunt; [...] "you {{have every}} thing so clean and tidy, dame, that I shall {{not know how}} to live <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to my own country--if ever <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hadn’t left it ten seconds," [...] he said, mysteriously. [...] "I {{went into}} the front room {{for a bit of}} stick, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> it had gone—vanished. I was never more {{surprised}} in my life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I must be sure," [...] {{he said to}} her gravely, [...] "of what I {{tell your}} father <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to him. Can I declare, with a safe conscience, that you will never see Lord Harry again?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly! through space--in that ball." [...] And I took {{a delicious}} mouthful of egg. I made a private note that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the moon I {{would take a}} box of eggs.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{the house}} the rain was {{beginning}} to fall; {{but there was no}} wind or sound in the air--only that dismal stillness, as if the world were holding its breath in expectation of a calamity.|$|E
6000|$|They {{were all}} {{gone from the}} stable, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the farm, except the bearded nurse, and one tall fellow, {{who might have been}} the [...] "Dying Gaul," [...] as he {{crouched}} there in the straw; and the mare was sleeping--her head between her nurse's knees.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I'm {{too old to}} go to {{such places}} for pleasure," [...] said the {{minister}} simply. [...] "But it was very interesting, and certainly very striking: especially <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back,</b> toward daylight, after seeing Mrs. Bowen home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no," [...] said I, not {{understanding}} {{what she was}} talking about. [...] "I am sure he will be buried somewhere near his home, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> his grave {{will be one of the}} first places I will visit." ...|$|R
5000|$|... “My first albums as Dimmer {{were quiet}} and {{introverted}} as a kickback against all that rock glory. But Dimmer’s been going {{a while now}} and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> and felt that rock glory, I thoroughly enjoyed it.”- Shayne Carter, September 2006 ...|$|R
6000|$|She was too languid to be {{more than}} {{indifferent}} when she saw us, and the first sign of warmth that she gave was her kiss, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> visit her after putting her to bed at the hotel. She looked up, put her arms round my neck, and said, [...] "This is like the old days." ...|$|E
60|$|All {{this had}} really taken {{but a few}} minutes. I was {{surprised}} when my eye met, through the chinks between the dark window blinds and the window cases, the brighter light of the coming dawn. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the sofa and took the tourniquet from Mrs. Grant, she went over and pulled up the blinds.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes," [...] {{interrupted}} Judson Tate; [...] "they have peculiar ways. But, as I {{was going}} to tell you: <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Oratama I found out from Manuel Iquito what was in that mixture he gave me for my lost voice. I told you how quick it cured me. He made that stuff from the chuchula plant. Now, look here." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{next day}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back,</b> my fears were realised: {{the door was}} refused to me--my Lady was not at home. This I knew to be false: I had watched the door the whole morning from a lodging I took at a house opposite.|$|R
60|$|However, {{they went}} {{off with an}} evident {{increase}} of comfort founded on their demonstrable advantage in being the real thing. I could fancy them shuddering over Miss Churm. She was very droll about them <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back,</b> for <b>I</b> told her what they wanted.|$|R
6000|$|... “Go to sleep!” {{said the}} American tranquilly. “I wouldn’t {{worry about the}} Sin Verguenza. Quite {{a few of them}} have picked up enough to retire on. I wish I hadn’t handed my haversack to black Domingo <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> for you. That’s what’s troubling me.” ...|$|R
60|$|My entrance, and my {{saying what}} I wanted, roused her. It {{disturbed}} the Doctor too, for <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> replace the candle I {{had taken from}} the table, he was patting her head, in his fatherly way, and saying he was a merciless drone to let her tempt him into reading on; {{and he would have}} her go to bed.|$|E
60|$|Having {{got over}} my {{difficulties}} with the ladies, I found more difficulties {{waiting for me}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> my own room. In came Penelope--with the natural sweetness of women--to kiss and make it up again; and--with the natural curiosity of women--to ask another question. This time she only wanted me {{to tell her what}} was the matter with our second housemaid, Rosanna Spearman.|$|E
6000|$|... "I saw God. God was light, God was truth. And I {{went back}} to my life, and God was hidden. God seemed to call me. He called. I heard him, I sought him and I touched his hand. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> my life I was {{presently}} lost in perplexity. I could not tell why God had called me nor what I had to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, your Majesty. I {{have seen}} your great city, {{and it is}} a {{wonderful}} one. And my friend has shown me this palace, with its woods and its grounds. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to my own country I will have much to say of what I have seen in your beautiful land." ...|$|R
2500|$|Subsequently, O'Neal {{earned an}} MBA online through the University of Phoenix in 2005. In {{reference}} to his completion of his MBA degree, he stated: [...] "It's just something to have on my resume for <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> into reality. Someday I might have to put down a basketball and have a regular 9-to-5 like everybody else." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It isn't a {{question}} of money. But--of course, you've never met my Aunt Agatha, so it's rather hard to explain. But she's a sort of human vampire-bat, and she'll make things most fearfully unpleasant for me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to England. She's {{the kind of woman}} who comes and rags you before breakfast, don't you know." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{looked at}} the window: it was hardly evening yet. The darkening of the light was {{produced}} by gathering clouds. Rain-drops pattered against the glass; the autumn wind whistled mournfully {{in the corners of}} the courtyard. I mended the fire before I renewed my search. My nerves were in fault again, I suppose. I shivered <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the book-case. My hands trembled: I wondered what was the matter with me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was curious}} to know who the people were who were always {{in the same place}} at the same time, so one day I took my telescope. I could see you plainly. You were reading and had your hat off. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the hotel I asked Mrs. Allardyce if she knew who the {{boarders}} at Fir Cottage were and she told me. I had heard Connie speak of you, and I determined to make your acquaintance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So I {{asked her}} to sit down, and ran up to call Mrs. Grover. She was busy with Grandpa just then, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> my lunch there sat my lady with her arms folded, water {{dripping}} out of the toes of her old boots as they hung down from the high chair, and the biggest blue eyes I ever saw fixed upon the cake and oranges on the table. I gave her a piece, and she sighed with rapture, but only picked at it till I asked if she didn't like it.|$|E
60|$|My best plan then {{seemed to}} be to <b>go</b> right <b>back</b> to the curly-headed pawnbroker, and take up with my first offer. But <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back,</b> the curly-headed man was very busy about {{something}} else, and kept me waiting a long time; at last I got a chance and told him I would take the three dollars he had offered.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is cared for," [...] said Roland; [...] "I locked {{gate and}} wicket on them <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back,</b> and no boat will stir {{from the island}} this night, if doors of good oak and bolts of iron can keep men within stone-walls.--And now I resign my office of porter of Lochleven, and give {{the keys to the}} Kelpie's keeping." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I couldn't get {{any work}} to do anywhere. I walked my legs off looking for work. I did get a job once, but I was off for a week because I was queer, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> they said they didn't want me any more. You can't blame them either, can you? Them places, they can't afford to have girls that aren't strong." ...|$|R
