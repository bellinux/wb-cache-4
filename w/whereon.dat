25|$|The new Harley {{ministry}} in London sought {{the same goals}} for Great Britain as had the Godolphin ministry, that is, to ensure the country's safety, prevent outside interference in its internal affairs, and secure its trade abroad. But there was one big difference – their readiness to commit to peace. As early as August 1710 the Tories had initiated secret talks with the French, seeking mutual ground <b>whereon</b> Great Britain and France could dictate peace {{to the rest of}} Europe. Initially, Harley and Shrewsbury conducted these talks through the Jacobite Earl of Jersey, and through Torcy's London agent, François Gaultier, who between them sketched out the broad outline of a peace agreement. At first the Tories had offered no concrete concessions to the French, but when news of the Allied retreat from Madrid and the defeat at Brihuega reached London in December, Anne's ministers finally resolved to abandon Spain and the Indies to Philip V (provided the thrones of France and Spain remained separate) in return for exclusive territorial and trade advantages. To this end they were aided by the sudden death in April 1711 of Holy Roman Emperor Joseph I. Joseph I's brother, Archduke Charles (Charles III of Spain), was his sole male heir, yet if Charles III was to succeed to the Austrian inheritance {{as well as that of}} Spain, the balance of power in Europe would once again be overthrown, this time in favour of the Austrian Habsburgs. For the Tories, the threat of a dominant Habsburg empire was no more desirable than a Bourbon one, but for now the need for the Grand Alliance remained: peace was necessary, yet in order to strengthen their negotiating position Queen Anne's ministers stood by the basic strategy of attacking Louis XIV across multiple fronts. In 1711 this was to include a revival of an earlier plan to seize the French stronghold of Quebec in North America.|$|E

It was created by William I and held for him by the Barton family in thegnage, and for them by a Norman knight named Elias, who fought in the crusades. On his death in Rhodes, the manor {{remained}} with Elias' son, whose family had by that time adopted {{the name of the}} village as its family name. On 23 June 1311 a substantial part of the Manor of Hulton was granted to the Worsleys.

500|$|Napoleon demanded, from {{a highly}} {{superior}} position, peace terms {{in what was}} to be called the Peace of Tilsit (1807). In the midst of these negotiations, the emperor agreed to keep half of Prussia intact. The men were joined by Queen Louise; Frederick William had sent for his wife, then pregnant with her daughter Princess Louise, to beg for a better settlement for Prussia, with Louise advising her husband, [...] "For God's sake no shameful peace... should at least not go down without honor." [...] As the king felt that her presence might put Napoleon in a [...] "more relaxed mood"; Louise reluctantly agreed to meet the emperor at Tilsit, but only to save [...] "her Prussia". Napoleon had previously attempted to destroy her reputation by questioning Louise's marital fidelity, but the queen met him anyway, attempting to use her beauty and charm to flatter him into more favorable terms. Formerly Louise had regularly referred to him as [...] "the Monster", but nevertheless made a request for a private interview with the emperor, <b>whereon</b> she threw herself at his feet; though he was impressed by her grace and determination, Napoleon refused to make any concessions, writing back to his wife Empress Joséphine that Louise [...] "is really charming and full of coquettishness toward me. But don't be jealous...it would cost me too dearly to play the gallant." [...] Napoleon's attempts to destroy Louise's reputation failed however, and they only made her more beloved in Prussia.

2500|$|Reading [...] "Bury me not, I pray, in Egypt", a Midrash {{explained}} that Jacob wanted his bones {{to be carried}} away from Egypt, lest Jacob's descendants remain there, arguing that Egypt must be a holy land, or Jacob {{would not have been}} buried there. The Midrash taught that Jacob also wanted his family quickly to rejoin him in the Land of Israel, as Jacob trusted God to fulfill God's promise in [...] "He shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers." [...] Alternatively, a Midrash taught that Jacob feared that when God afflicted the Egyptians with the Plagues, they would surround Jacob's sepulcher and beseech him to intercede for them. If he did intercede, he would be helping God's enemies. If he did not, he would cause God's Name to be profaned by the Egyptians, who would call Jacob's God inefficacious.

2500|$|The great antiquity of the Pyramids caused {{their true}} nature to become {{increasingly}} obscured. [...] As the Egyptian scholar Abu Ja‘far al-Idrisi (d. 1251), {{the author of}} the oldest known extensive study of the Pyramids, puts it: [...] "The nation that built it lay destroyed, it has no successor to carry the truth of its stories from father to son, as sons of other nations carry from their fathers what they love and cherish among their stories." [...] As a result, the oldest discussion of the Pyramids that has survived is from the Greek historian Herodotus, who visited them soon after 450 BCE. He describes [...] "the underground chambers on the hill <b>whereon</b> the pyramids stand," [...] which [...] "the king meant to be burial places for himself." [...] Several later classical authors, such as Diodorus Siculus, who visited Egypt ca. 60 BCE, also recorded that the “kings built the pyramids to serve as their tombs”; and similarly Strabo, who made his visit in 25 BCE, explicitly noted that they were “the tombs of kings”; yet in 77 CE the well-read natural historian Pliny the Elder simply says they were “a superfluous and foolish display of wealth,” built by the kings so as “to avoid providing funds for their successors or for rivals who wished to plot against them, or else to keep the common folk occupied.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{expanded}} {{portion of}} the ode {{is related to the}} ideas expressed in Wordsworth's The Prelude Book V in their emphasis on childhood memories and a connection between the divine and humanity. To Wordsworth, the soul was created by the divine and was able to recognise the light in the world. As a person ages, they are no longer able to see the light, but they can still recognise the beauty in the world. He elaborated on this belief in a note to the text: [...] "Archimedes said that he could move the world if he had a point <b>whereon</b> to rest his machine. Who has not felt the same aspirations as regards the world of his own mind? Having to wield some of its elements when I was impelled to write this poem on the [...] "Immortality of the Soul", I took hold of the notion of pre-existence as having sufficient foundation in humanity for authorising me to make for my purpose the best use I could of it as a Poet." [...] This [...] "notion of pre-existence" [...] is somewhat Platonic in nature, and it is the basis for Wordsworth believing that children are able to be the [...] "best philosopher". The idea was not intended as a type of , the reincarnation of the soul from person to person, and Wordsworth later explained that the poem was not meant to be regarded as a complete philosophical view: [...] "In my Ode... I do not profess to give a literal representation {{of the state of the}} affections and of the moral being in childhood. I record my feelings at that time,--my absolute spirituality, my 'all-soulness,' if I may so speak. At that time I could not believe that I should lie down quietly in the grave, and that my body would moulder into dust." ...|$|E
