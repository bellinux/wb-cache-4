5|$|Observations {{show that}} nuptial flight {{does not occur}} before February. This is based on larvae {{spinning}} into cocoons by November, and by January, these cocoons could not produce adult workers or reproductive males and females. Queens are most likely fertilised by males sometime between February and April; however, scientists have seen alates engage in nuptial flight during March. Before emerging from their parent nest, queens will shed their wings inside the nest and mate with low-flying males nearby. After nuptial flight, a queen will isolate herself and form a small chamber underground, where she remains for seven to eight months. However, it is improbable that a queen can survive on her own storage of fat and wing-musculature for that long. During this time, the queen may emerge from her nest occasionally, but she will only lay eggs from October to November {{when there is a}} rich supply of food. While this may be the case, some queens will lay eggs after a month of isolation during winter. M.regularis is a semi-clasutral ant, meaning that a queen <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> and forage in order to feed her young. Queens will emerge from their nests from time to time, during which they will capture insects for their young or feed on sweet substances. If food sources are deprived, a queen will only rely on her fat to feed the larvae until she perishes or finds food, but the larvae will not be cannibalised, and remain alive until a week after the queen's death. An individual ant may take eight months to develop from an egg to an adult.|$|E

500|$|On 7 July 2008, media {{reported}} that Ganguly was being projected {{as a candidate}} for the post of President of the Cricket Association of Bengal(CAB) against his former mentor Jagmohan Dalmiya. Reports also suggested that he could run for the post of BCCIPresident in 2014 as East Zone's representative. Ganguly himself did not deny the reports and did not rule out any such move. The same year in October, Ganguly announced that the Test series against Australia starting in October 2008 would be his last and stated [...] "o be honest, I didn't expect to be picked for this series. Before coming here, [...] I spoke to my team-mates and hopefully I <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> with a winning knock." [...] Ganguly played in every game of the four-Test series and amassed 324 runs at an average of 54.00. While playing the second Test match of the series in Mohali, Ganguly scored his final test century. In the final test match he played at Nagpur against Australia he scored 85 and 0 in his first and second innings respectively.

India regained the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, winning the series 2–0.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, IGN {{named the}} Dreamcast the 8th {{greatest}} video game console of all time, giving {{credit to the}} innovations and software for the system. [...] According to IGN, [...] "The Dreamcast was the first console to incorporate a built-in modem for online play, and while the networking lacked the polish and refinement of its successors, {{it was the first}} time users could seamlessly power on and play with users around the globe." [...] In 2010, PC Magazines Jeffrey L. Wilson named the Dreamcast the greatest video game console, emphasizing that the system was [...] "gone too soon". In 2013, Edge named the Dreamcast the 10th best console of the last 20 years, highlighting innovations that it added to console video gaming, including in-game voice chat, downloadable content, and second screen technology through the use of VMUs. Edge explained the system's poor performance by stating, [...] "Sega's console was undoubtedly ahead of its time, and it suffered at retail for that reason... ut its influence can still be felt today." [...] Writing in 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die, Duncan Harris noted [...] "One of the reasons that older gamers mourned the loss of the Dreamcast was that it signaled the demise of arcade gaming culture... Sega's console gave hope that things were not about to change for the worse and that the tenets of fast fun and bright, attractive graphics were not about to sink into a brown and green bog of realistic war games." [...] Parish, writing for USgamer, contrasted the Dreamcast's diverse library with the [...] "suffocating sense of conservatism" [...] that pervaded the gaming industry in the following decade. Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer, discussing the Dreamcast's portrayal [...] "as a small, square, white plastic JFK", commented that the system's short lifespan [...] "may have sealed its reputation as one of the greatest consoles ever": [...] "Nothing builds a cult like a tragic demise". According to IGN's Travis Fahs, [...] "Many hardware manufacturers have come and gone, but it's unlikely any <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> with half as much class as Sega." ...|$|E
