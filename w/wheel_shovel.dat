30|$|In {{order to}} speed up {{disaster}} relief operations, large obstacles can be surmounted instead of clearing them. Using crawler <b>wheels,</b> power <b>shovels</b> {{have the ability to}} go over objects effectively compared to other vehicles. However, there exists several challenges to obstacle surmounting with power shovels as follows: only the obstacles that are within the climbing limit of the crawler can be overcome; crawler power can be easily saturated; power shovel can tip over and damage itself if not moved skillfully when it is on top of an obstacle; being heavy machines, power shovels are also difficult {{to get back to the}} original state at the event of tip over.|$|R
50|$|In 1986, the {{business}} was purchased by Bonaventure Group, Inc. Shortly afterward, much of the companyâ€™s focus shifted to providing vehicle fire suppression systems to the mining market, first in the United States and then beginning in 1994 in the Latin American countries. AFEX systems are typically found on: excavators, haul trucks, power <b>shovels,</b> <b>wheel</b> loaders, bulldozers, graders, etc. Other industries served where fire is a significant hazard are steel, mass transit, pulp and paper and agriculture.|$|R
50|$|Construction on {{the road}} began on 19 September 1919, built by {{approximately}} 3,000 returned servicemen as a war memorial for fellow servicemen {{who had been killed}} in World War I. An advance survey team progressed through dense wilderness at approximately 3 kilometres a month. Construction was done by hand; using explosives, pick and <b>shovel,</b> <b>wheel</b> barrows, and some small machinery, and was at times perilous, with several workers killed on the job; the final sections along steep coastal mountains being the most difficult to work on. Anecdotal evidence from ABC archives in 1982 suggested workers would rest detonators on their knees during travel, as it was the softest ride for them.|$|R
50|$|Quick {{couplers}} are devices {{installed at}} the outer end of the work equipment of various types of construction and earth-moving machines. They facilitate the rapid exchange of working tools or buckets. Quick couplers are most common on hydraulic excavators and compact excavators and on the backhoe equipment of backhoe loaders, but are also installed on telescopic handlers, <b>wheel</b> loaders (loading <b>shovels),</b> skid-steer loaders and the loader equipment of backhoe-loaders. They are also occasionally installed on attachments installed on agricultural tractors.Quick couplers do not normally have a specific function themselves in {{that they do not}} carry out handling or digging operations, but when installed on a machine they {{become a part of the}} overall system. They are usually mounted on the machine by means of the pins that would otherwise be the mountings for the bucket or attachment.This article concentrates on quick couplers installed on excavators and similar equipment.|$|R
50|$|The typical wagon with 40 to 50 in {{diameter}} wheels could easily move {{over rough ground}} and rocks without high centering and even over most tree stumps if required. The wooden wheels were protected with an iron rim (tire) typically about 1.5 in wide. These iron tires were installed hot so they would shrink tightly onto the wood wheel when they cooled. Nevertheless, it was often necessary to use wooden wedges to keep the iron rim on or soak the wheel in water. The dry desert air sometimes dried the tires so much the iron tire was prone to fall off. Wagon wheels could often be repaired by blacksmiths found along the way or replaced with an abandoned wagon's wheel but otherwise if damaged the wagon usually had to be abandoned. Some damaged wagons were salvaged by cutting the wagon in half and converting the front or rear half of the wagon into a two-wheeled cart. Most of the wagons had a large toolbox, mounted on the left side, usually containing an ax, wagon jack, ropes, short handled <b>shovel,</b> <b>wheel</b> chains for securing the wheels for steep descents and extra chain to hook up another team if double teaming was required for steep ascents and other tools often needed or used. The wagon jack was used for raising each wagon wheel. Then the large axle nut could be unscrewed and the wheel removed for greasing which was required periodically. The wheels were greased {{with a mixture of}} tar or pine resin and lard contained in a covered wooden bucket or large ox horn often hanging from the rear axle to keep its greasy contents away from other goods. Starting with at least one gallon of wagon grease was recommended. On a wagon there was essentially no reverse or brakes and the turning radius was nearly always greater than 125 ft so the teamsters had to think about how to extract the wagon and his team from wherever they went.|$|R
40|$|In 2001, the Catholic University of Chile {{undertook}} a maintenance benchmarking study of six open pit copper mines having mill capacities varying between 18, 000 t/d and 156, 000 t/d, and collectively responsible for 58 % of Chilean copper production. Key performance indices {{were selected to}} measure the effectiveness, efficiency, {{and development of the}} maintenance process. Key effectiveness indices used in the mining industry are equipment availability, reliability, and maintainability and safety indices. Reliability is often measured by mean time between failures (MTBF) and maintainability as the mean time to repair or restore service (MTTR). At the time of undertaking the benchmarking study (2001), only two of the six participating mines routinely measured these parameters. For this reason, the study focused on comparing fleet availabilities. Accident rate and accident severity (expressed as the number of lost time incidents and lost time hours per million man hours, respectively) were solicited for all permanent and contracted maintenance personnel. Financial data provided by the participating companies included total annual maintenance and mining costs, as well as a breakdown of labour, materials, and contractor costs. This data, when combined with ore and waste production data, enabled the unit costs of maintenance to be calculated. Internal efficiency indicators were solicited for: * the percentage of planned maintenance (preventive, predictive, and programmed major component replacement) carried out on each equipment fleet (blasthole drills, hydraulic and cable <b>shovels,</b> <b>wheel</b> loaders, haul trucks, and auxiliary equipment); * scheduled maintenance compliance (actual planned hours versus scheduled planned hours); * organizational efficiency in terms of the ratio of supervisors to maintenance technicians; * investment in maintenance planning as evident from the ratio of planners to maintenance technicians (planning clerks and statisticians were also considered to be maintenance planners); and * efficiency in inventory practices as evident from the stores turnover ratio and service level. Development indices were solicited for the educational level of maintenance employees and the level of commitment to maintenance training by both the companies and their collaborators, in terms of annual training hours and investment per employee. The principal conclusions of the study were as follows: * For the six open pit mines that participated in the study, maintenance costs were found to average 44 % of mining costs. This highlights the importance of the direct cost of maintenance to the financial performance of mines. * Percentage planned maintenance of equipment fleets were low by world standards, averaging 35 %, 56 %, and 44 %, respectively, for blasthole drill, shovel, and haul truck fleets. * Fleet availabilities were significantly influenced by the percentage of planned maintenance achieved. For example, haul truck fleet availabilities were found to increase on average by 1 % for every 4 % increase in planned maintenance over the range examined. * Maintenance cost per equipment was found to decrease non-linearly with increases in percentage planned maintenance. An empirical relationship was determined {{that can be used to}} estimate potential cost savings as a result of improved planned maintenance practices (see figure). * The ratio of maintenance planning staff to maintenance technicians varied between 1 : 10 and 1 : 24, indicating improvement opportunities for some of the participating companies. Investment in technical training (including planned maintenance practice) was found to be low by global industry standards. It was concluded that fleet availability and maintenance costs in Chilean open pit operations could be considerably improved by improving and/or developing maintenance planning standards, and training personnel in planned maintenance technique...|$|R
