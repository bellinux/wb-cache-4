5000|$|BBC Radio {{refused to}} play the song, as it {{contained}} {{the name of a}} commercial publication (Rolling Stone) and could therefore be considered advertising. An urban legend states that the song was re-recorded by the band as [...] "The Cover of the Radio Times", the <b>weekly</b> <b>television</b> and radio <b>guide</b> published by the BBC; however, this is disputed by Dennis Locorriere, Dr. Hook's co-lead singer. [...] "Legend has it that we went into a studio and rerecorded the song. What actually happened was that a bunch of BBC disc jockeys went into a studio and shouted 'RADIO TIMES' over our original chorus," [...] Locorriere said. [...] "It's the same recording that we released but with the addition of their voices layered on top of ours. You can, however, still hear us singing 'Rolling Stone,' but way in the background, under their voices." [...] The new version was rush-released in the UK, but did not find its way onto the charts there.|$|R
