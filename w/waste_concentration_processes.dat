This method is more comprehensive than conventional boat sampling in dispersion studies. The photographic technique permits <b>waste</b> <b>concentrations</b> to be measured throughout the plume in one instant; thereby allowing the diffusion analysis {{to be based on}} a nonsteady state model rather than the normally assumed steady state model. Field studies were conducted on the waste plume from an ocean outfall. <b>Waste</b> <b>concentrations</b> were measured by conventional boat sampling while aerial photography was taken of the area, Com-puterized procedures were developed for computing the water cur-rents, <b>waste</b> <b>concentrations</b> and diffusion coefficients from the photography. Comparisons of <b>waste</b> <b>concentrations</b> indicated that the discrepancies are due primarily to changing and shifting of the waste field in this dynamic environment...|$|R

The synthetic waste formulations were used to simulate concentrated domestic wastes flowing from dwellings whose water use has been reduced {{by the use of}} water saving devices such as low flow toilets and showers. Biological treatment of wastes with Chemical Oxygen Demands (COD) of up to 1500 mg/ 1 using activated sludge was investigated with both bench scale batch and continuous processes. Specific items investigated as functions of <b>waste</b> <b>concentration</b> included substrate removal rates, oxygen uptake rates, aeration properties, sludge settling, sludge aeration time, and aeration tank turbulence. Substrate removal rates were not enhanced by increasing domestic <b>waste</b> <b>concentrations</b> although oxygen uptake rates did increase slightly due to possible differences in sludge yield. The minimum sludge aeration time was found to be between 12 and 16 hours per day. Increasing mixing intensity in the aeration tanks reduced sludge settling ability without significantly improving the substrate removal rate. Aeration properties of systems treating wastes at 1500 mg/ 1 COD were found to be inferior to those of systems treating wastes at 750 and 250 mg/ 1 COD. No significant differences were observed between systems treating 250 and 750 mg/I COD wastes.

Microorganisms that were able to ferment sugar into ethanol were isolated from local food sources which were Tapai ubi and Tapai pulut. In this study, four types of yeast were used during fermentation which was isolated from Tapai ubi and Tpapi pulut and also selected the best one in terms of highest production of bioethanol before optimization with RSM.

Despite avoiding <b>concentration</b> <b>process</b> of the eluted solution, lower limit of quantization (LLOQ) of propofol was 25 [*]ng/mL.

This technique is not limited by sea conditions and permits monitoring and evaluation of outfall sites throughout the year. Photography taken at one instant provides comprehensive information throughout the waste field. Manpower requirements and costs for this method are considerably less than for conventional boat sampling surveys. Field studies were conducted on the waste plumes from Kraft pulp mill ocean outfalls at Newport and Gardiner, Oregon and Samoa, California. <b>Waste</b> <b>concentrations</b> were measured by conventional boat sampling techniques while aerial photography was taken of the outfall area from altitudes ranging from 3, 000 to 11, 000 ft. Computerized procedures were used to compute water currents, <b>waste</b> <b>concentrations,</b> toxicity zones and diffusion coefficients from the photography. The highest concentration measured directly over the outfalls was 2. 3 percent waste by volume and the maximum area of influence with concentrations greater than 0. 2 percent waste was 155 acres. The maximum concentration determined over the outfall for each field study was generally less than that shown to have a detrimental effect on young salmon for a 14 -day exposure. Surface water current was found to be the dominant factor in the resulting plume pattern. During periods of low current velocities in the receiving water, the hydraulic head created by the effluent source was a significant factor in the resulting plume shape. The steady state form of the Fickian diffusion equation and unidirectional transport velocity was not applicable to the majority of the observations.
