5|$|On June 6, the {{two major}} party campaigns crossed paths in Woodstock, Ontario. Speaking in the afternoon, St. Laurent drew a crowd of 200. To the shock of St. Laurent staffers, who {{remained}} for the Diefenbaker appearance, the PC leader drew an overflow crowd of over a thousand that evening, {{even though he was}} an hour late, with announcements made to the excited crowd that he was slowed by voters who <b>wanted</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> see him or shake his hand.|$|E

50|$|Schopenhauer {{notes the}} misery which results from sexual relationships. According to him, this {{directly}} explains {{the sentiments of}} shame and sadness which tend to follow the act of sexual intercourse. For, he states, the only power that reigns is the inextinguishable desire to face, at any price, the blind love present in human existence without any consideration of the outcome. He estimates that a genius of his species is an industrial being who <b>wants</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> produce, and <b>wants</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> think. The theme of lust for Schopenhauer is thus to consider the horrors which will almost certainly follow the culmination of lust.|$|R
25|$|Bucci’s Defenses: Bucci {{argued that}} he was {{protected}} because his usage of the mark was both parody and protected by the First Amendment. As for the parody defense, {{the court held that}} it did not apply because the initial site viewing did not contradict an internet user’s assumption that the site was operated by Planned Parenthood. For the First Amendment defense, the court held that because Planned Parenthood <b>wanted</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> restrain Bucci’s usage of their mark as a domain, and not his actual speech, the defense did not apply.|$|E
25|$|Banditry was a {{major issue}} in California after 1849, as {{thousands}} of young men detached from family or community moved into a land with few law enforcement mechanisms. To combat this, the San Francisco Committee of Vigilance was established to give drumhead trials and death sentences to well-known offenders. As such, other earlier settlements created their own private agencies to protect communities {{due to the lack of}} peace-keeping establishments. These vigilance committees reflected different occupations in the frontier, such as land clubs, cattlemen's associations and mining camps. Similar vigilance committees also existed in Texas, and their main objective was to stamp out lawlessness and rid communities of desperadoes and rustlers. These committees would sometimes form mob rule for private vigilante groups, but usually were made up of responsible citizens who <b>wanted</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> maintain order. Criminals caught by these vigilance committees were treated cruelly; often hung or shot without any form of trial.|$|E
25|$|On Friday, April 23, {{the most}} complex and thorny issues were debated. The first {{contentious}} issue on the agenda dealt with natural resources industries, such as the oil, gas, and mines, as it became the centre of a major showdown between the Waffle and the labour movement forces. The Waffle faction wanted total nationalization and public ownership of resource industries. The party establishment, and Labour, being more moderate, <b>wanted</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> expand public and co-operative ownership. The hour-long debate, quickly transcended into raucous name-calling and physical pushing and shoving at the microphone stands. Sidney Green, Manitoba’s Minister of Mines and Resources in the NDP provincial government, spoke in favour of the moderate resolutions committee motion. He was countered on the convention floor by university professor Peter Usher, a Waffle member from Ottawa, who moved to refer the committee’s motion back for redrafting to push for nationalization of all resource industries. After much heated debate, his motion was defeated in a standing-count vote by a three to one margin. The standing vote was needed because Waffle members challenged two previous voting attempts. Once defeated, the Unity Group, and its labour supporters, pressed for {{the adoption of the}} original eight-point resolution, which then passed easily with a five to one plurality. With the Waffle’s amendment defeated, it seemed unlikely that they could pass other motions that called for the nationalization of other economic sectors like manufacturing, financial, and transportation.|$|E

500|$|The U.S. militia {{decided to}} wait until the {{following}} day to pursue Black Hawk. To their surprise, when morning arrived, their enemy had disappeared. Shortly before dawn one of the leaders accompanying Black Hawk, a Sauk chieftain named Neapope, had attempted from the knoll on which the band had taken refuge to explain to the militia officers that his group <b>wanted</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> end the fighting and go back across the Mississippi River. In a [...] "loud shrill voice" [...] he delivered a conciliatory speech in his native Ho-Chunk language, assuming Pauquette and his band of Ho-Chunk guides were still with the militia. However, the U.S. troops did not understand him, because their Ho-Chunk allies had already departed the battlefield.|$|E

500|$|This myth {{was founded}} in the factual {{knowledge}} of the immigrants' participation in the battles, and the mythical knowledge because {{of the differences in}} the number of victims, the leaving of the injured on the fields of battle, and that the Latrun battle was the hardest and most important in the war. The influence on written history appeared primarily in books and commentary, where [...] "the immigrants <b>wanted</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> make sure that their contribution at the battle was written in the collective memory with a plus sign". It didn't bring new documents but it expressed itself in memoirs, reminiscences and obituaries by or of those involved in the events. It was a view that was seldom heard in polemics giving two preceding versions of events but that had a life of its own, given to it by the immigrants.|$|E
500|$|Casting a {{retrospective}} {{light on his}} interest in Caliban in Characters of Shakespear's Plays, the following year Hazlitt, {{in a review of}} [...] "Mr. Coleridge's Lectures", responded indignantly to Coleridge's calling Caliban a [...] "villain", as well as a [...] "Jacobin", who <b>wanted</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> spread anarchy. Though speaking somewhat tongue-in-cheek, Hazlitt rises to Caliban's defence: [...] "Caliban is so far from being a prototype of modern Jacobinism, that he is strictly the legitimate sovereign of the isle". Hazlitt did not necessarily believe that Caliban deserved to supplant Prospero as ruler, but he shows that Caliban's very existence raises questions about the fundamental nature of sovereignty, justice, and society itself. As noted by David Bromwich, Coleridge found reasons to apologise for society as it was. Hazlitt, on the other hand, refused to take sides, leaving as open questions the issues that emerged in the play. [...] "It was left to Hazlitt to interpret Caliban's coarseness and the justice of his protests as both alike irreducible." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{few hours}} after midnight on 22 July, with Black Hawk's band resting on a knoll on the Wisconsin Heights Battlefield, Neapope, {{one of the key}} leaders {{accompanying}} Black Hawk, attempted to explain to the nearby militia officers that his group <b>wanted</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> end the fighting and go back across the Mississippi River. In a [...] "loud shrill voice" [...] he delivered a conciliatory speech in his native Ho-Chunk language, assuming Pauquette and his band of Ho-Chunk guides were still with the militia at Wisconsin Heights. However, the U.S. troops did not understand him, because their Sauk allies had already departed the battlefield. Following this failed attempt at peace, Neapope abandoned the cause and returned to a nearby Ho-Chunk village. The British Band had slowly disintegrated over the months of conflict; most of the Ho-Chunk and Potawatomi that had joined were gone by the Battle of Bad Axe. Others, especially children and the elderly, had died of starvation while the band fled the pursuing militia through the swamps around Lake Koshkonong.|$|E

2500|$|One other {{strain in}} {{criticism}} is {{to read in}} the story an almost Jamesian moral with Delano as the American who, [...] "confronted with evil in unescapable form, <b>wanted</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> turn over a new leaf, to deny and to forget the lesson {{he ought to have}} learned." [...] Such an American survives [...] "by being less than fully human," [...] while Europeans are [...] "broken by the weight of their knowledge of and complicity in human evil." [...] Literary historian Richard Gray calls the novella an interrogation of [...] "the American optimism of its narrator [...] and the European pessimism of its protagonist, Cereno, under the shadow of slavery." [...] Delano represents a version of New England innocence which has also been read as strategy to ensure colonial power over both Spain and Africans in the [...] "New World".|$|E
