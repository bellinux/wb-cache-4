40|$|This {{study is}} aimed at {{forecasting}} {{the changes in the}} suitability of brown trout habitat (Salmo trutta L.), caused by alterations in the stream temperature and the flow regime under climate change scenarios. The stream temperature and instantaneous flow in several streams in Central Spain were modelled from daily temperature and precipitation data. Logistic models were used for stream temperature modelling whereas M 5 ? model trees were used to develop the precipitation-runoff models. These models were utilized to simulate the running flows under the climate change scenarios RCP 4. 5 and RCP 8. 5 (5 thIPCC). The resulting forecasts suggested a different response of the stream temperature to the atmospheric warming in accordance with the geologic nature of basins. At the same time, significant decreases in summer flow and increases in the frequency of zero-flow events were predicted. In the future, significant declines in summer flow could exacerbate the negative impact on trout populations of increased water temperature by reducing both the suitable spatial habitat and the <b>warming</b> <b>resistance</b> of the water mass...|$|R

50|$|If {{the plastic}} {{deformation}} {{is carried out}} under dynamic conditions, such as by drop forging, then the plastic deformation is localized more as the forging hammer speed is increased. This also means that the deformed material becomes hotter the higher {{the speed of the}} drop hammer. Now as metals become <b>warmer,</b> their <b>resistance</b> to further plastic deformation decreases. From this point we can see that there is a type of cascade effect: as more plastic deformation is absorbed by the metal, more heat is produced, making it easier for the metal to deform further. This is a catastrophic effect which almost inevitably leads to failure.|$|R
40|$|Antarctic {{marine species}} have evolved {{in one of}} the coldest and most temperature-stable marine environments on Earth. They have long been {{classified}} as being stenothermal, or having a poor capacity to resist warming. Here we show that their ability to acclimate their physiology to elevated temperatures is poor compared with species from temperate latitudes, and similar to those from the tropics. Those species that have been demonstrated to acclimate take a very long time to do so, with Antarctic fish requiring up to 21 – 36 days to acclimate, which is 2 – 4 times as long as temperate species, and invertebrates requiring between 2 and 5 months to complete whole-animal acclimation. Investigations of upper thermal tolerance (CTmax) in Antarctic marine species have shown that as the rate of warming is reduced in experiments, CTmax declines markedly, ranging from 8 to 17. 5 °C across 13 species at a rate of warming of 1 °C day− 1, and from 1 to 6 °C at a rate of 1 °C month− 1. This effect of the rate of warming on CTmax also appears to be present at all latitudes. A macrophysiological analysis of long-term CTmax across latitudes for marine benthic groups showed that both Antarctic and tropical species were less resistant to elevated temperatures in experiments and thus had lower warming allowances (measured as the difference between long-term CTmax and experienced environmental temperature), or <b>warming</b> <b>resistance,</b> than temperate species. This makes them more at risk from warming than species from intermediate latitudes. This suggests that the variability of environmental temperature may be a major factor in dictating an organism's responses to environmental change...|$|R

40|$|The {{electrical}} resistance of nano-diamond powders was measured from 130 K to 370 K. As {{the temperature was}} reduced from room temperature (around 295 K), at a particular temperature (around 245 K) the resistance increased to the limit of our device (10 exp 38 Ohm), where it remained down to 130 K.

When the conductance was plotted instead of the resistance, a behavior reminiscent of superconductivity was noted: the conductance steadily dropped with cooling until a critical temperature Tc was reached, whereupon the conductance dropped suddenly (in less that 0. 5 sec) and completely to zero (less than 10 exp- 38 S). Upon warming, the conductance reappeared at around the same Tc: anti-superconductivity. Subsequent measurements revealed that exposure to a relative humidity of at least 55 % was necessary for the observance of the transitions...|$|R

40|$|BEFORE {{beginning}} {{a discussion of}} lethal body temperatures, it must {{be pointed out that}} there can be no sharply denned high or low body temperature that always results in death. Whether or not a certain body temperature kills the individual depends upon such factors as length of exposure to a given temperature, rate of cooling or <b>warming,</b> individual <b>resistance,</b> etc. In the experiments to be described, unusually high and low ambi-ent air temperatures were used to elimi-nate as far as possible the effects of time as a factor.

50|$|As the {{inrush current}} limiter self-heats, the current {{begins to flow}} through it and <b>warm</b> it.

After the capacitors in the power supply become charged, the self heated inrush current limiter offers little resistance in the circuit, with a low voltage drop {{with respect to the}} total voltage drop of the circuit. A disadvantage is that immediately after the device is switched off, the NTC resistor is still hot and has a low resistance. It cannot limit the inrush current unless it cools for more than 1 minute to get a higher resistance. Another disadvantage is that the NTC thermistor is not short circuit proof.|$|R

40|$|We {{hypothesize that}} {{biological}} diversification across ecological, spatial, and temporal scales maintains and regenerates the ecosystem services that provide critical inputs - such as maintenance of soil quality, nitrogen fixation, pollination, and pest control - to agriculture. Agrobiodiversity is sustained by diversified farming practices {{and it also}} supplies multiple ecosystem services to agriculture, thus reducing environmental externalities {{and the need for}} off-farm inputs. We reviewed the literature that compares biologically diversified farming systems with conventional farming systems, and we examined 12 ecosystem services: biodiversity; soil quality; nutrient management; water-holding capacity; control of weeds, diseases, and pests; pollination services; carbon sequestration; energy efficiency and reduction of <b>warming</b> potential; <b>resistance</b> and resilience to climate change; and crop productivity. We found that compared with conventional farming systems, diversified farming systems support substantially greater biodiversity, soil quality, carbon sequestration, and water-holding capacity in surface soils, energy-use efficiency, and resistance and resilience to climate change. Relative to conventional monocultures, diversified farming systems also enhance control of weeds, diseases, and arthropod pests and they increase pollination services; however, available evidence suggests that these practices may often be insufficient to control pests and diseases or provide sufficient pollination. Significantly less public funding has been applied to agroecological research and the improvement of diversified farming systems than to conventional systems. Despite this lack of support, diversified farming systems have only somewhat reduced mean crop productivity relative to conventional farming systems, but they produce far fewer environmental and social harms. We recommend that more research and crop breeding be conducted to improve diversified farming systems and reduce yield gaps when they occur. Because single diversified farming system practices, such as crop rotation, influence multiple ecosystem services, such research should be holistic and integrated across many components of the farming system. Detailed agroecological research especially is needed to develop crop- and region-specific approaches to control of weeds, diseases, and pests...|$|R

Growth of lactic streptococci in skimmilk prior to making direct-acid Cottage cheese increased the non-protein nitrogen in the milk, increased the firmness and moisture content of the uncreamed curd, and significantly improved the meatiness and body and texture scores of the creamed Cottage cheese.

Closed incubators and open radiant warmers are {{the most widely used}} devices for the care of neonates in intensive care; however, several well-known limitations of these devises have not been resolved. The use of laminar flow is widely used in many fields of medicine, and may have applications in neonatal care. Objective: To describe the neonatal laminar flow unit, a new equipment we designed for care of ill newborns. Methods: The idea, design, and development of this device was completed in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The unit is an open mobile bed designed with the objective of maintaining the advantages of the incubator and radiant warmer, while overcoming some of their inherent shortcomings; these shortcomings include noise, magnetic fields and acrylic barriers in incubators, and lack of isolation and water loss through skin in radiant warmers. The unit has a pump that aspirates environmental air which is <b>warmed</b> by electrical <b>resistance</b> and decontaminated with High Efficiency Particulate Air Filter (HEPA) filters (laminar flow). The flow is directed by an air flow directioner. The unit has an embedded humidifier to increase humidity in the infant’s microenvironment and a servo control mechanism for regulation of skin temperature. Results: The laminar flow unit is open and facilitates access of care providers and family, which is not the case in incubators. It provides warming by convection at an air velocity of 0. 45 m/s, much faster than an incubator (0. 1 m/s). The system provides isolation 1000 class (less than 1, 000 particles higher than 0. 3 micron per cubic feet at all times). This is much more protection than an incubator provides and more than radiant warmers, which have no isolation whatsoever. Additionally, it provides humidification of the newborn’s microenvironment (about 60 % relative humidity), which is impossible with a radiant warmer, which produces high water body loss. It has no mechanical barriers like acrylic walls, its magnetic field is lower than an incubator (0. 25 µt versus 1. 2 µt), and the noise is minimal compared to incubators. The unit is also able to provide controlled total body hypothermia, which is not possible with either of the other two units. Conclusion: The laminar flow unit for neonatal care is a novel device which we recently developed. The introduction of laminar flow technology represents a real innovation in the neonatal field. We have described the various components of the unit and the potential advantages for management of ill neonates. This will hopefully lead to improved clinical outcomes and more effective neonatal management and safety. Keywords: laminar flow, newborn intensive care, incubator, radiant warme...|$|R
