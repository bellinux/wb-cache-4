5|$|Not one of {{the marchers}} even raised an arm {{to fend off the}} blows. They went down like ten-pins. From <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> I heard the sickening whacks of the clubs on {{unprotected}} skulls. The waiting crowd of watchers groaned and sucked in their breaths in sympathetic pain at every blow. Those struck down fell sprawling, unconscious or writhing in pain with fractured skulls or broken shoulders. In two or three minutes the ground was quilted with bodies. Great patches of blood widened on their white clothes. The survivors without breaking ranks silently and doggedly marched on until struck down....Finally the police became enraged by the non-resistance....They commenced savagely kicking the seated men in the abdomen and testicles. The injured men writhed and squealed in agony, which seemed to inflame the fury of the police....The police then began dragging the sitting men by the arms or feet, sometimes for a hundred yards, and throwing them into ditches.|$|E
25|$|He {{laid down}} the laws for me. It was a good chat. I knew exactly <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> with him, and I went away with a new belief, {{in terms of where}} I wanted to head.

2500|$|Joe Swash has {{revealed}} that giving Mickey a family was not the producers' original plan for the character, but he was pleased when he was told of the development one year prior to their introduction: [...] "Before, I {{was in and out}} all the time. I didn't really know <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> as an actor. Now that the family are here, I feel like Mickey's a more regular character. I'm really happy about it [...] I didn't know exactly what they'd be like until about three or four months ago. They're really different which I think is good. I'm really pleased with them [...] they're really close. They won't hear a bad word said about each other. They'll kid each other in private, but in public they rally round and stick up for each other [...] a bit of a mummy's boy." ...|$|E
2500|$|John Rodden {{points out}} the [...] "undeniable {{conservative}} features in the Orwell physiognomy" [...] and remarks on how [...] "to some extent Orwell facilitated the kinds of uses and abuses by the Right that his name has been put to. In other ways there has been the politics of selective quotation." [...] Rodden refers to the essay [...] "Why I Write", in which Orwell refers to the Spanish Civil War as being his [...] "watershed political experience", saying [...] "The Spanish War and other events in 1936–37, turned the scale. Thereafter I knew <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>stood.</b> Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written directly or indirectly against totalitarianism and for Democratic Socialism as I understand it." [...] (emphasis in original) Rodden goes on to explain how, during the McCarthy era, {{the introduction to the}} Signet edition of Animal Farm, which sold more than 20 million copies, makes use of [...] "the politics of ellipsis": ...|$|E
2500|$|For the First Test against New Zealand Snow {{was told}} by the {{chairman}} of the selectors Alec Bedser that he was dropped so that they could watch Alan Ward in a Test match, but Illingworth rang {{in the middle of the}} Essex vs Sussex match to tell Snow straight that he was dropped for disobeying his orders in the Test. Snow was particularly annoyed as a television firm had arranged to film him at Lord's to make a fifteen-minute programme with John Betjeman about his poem Lords' Test, which was now cancelled. [...] The immediate recipients of Snow's wrath were Essex (6/20) and Hampshire (5/29 & 5/51) to give Sussex their first two wins of the season. He and Illingworth sorted out their differences and [...] "I was to know exactly <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> with him as did every other player who came under his captaincy". He was recalled for the Second and Third Tests, which were won easily, but Snow took only 3 wickets (51.33), but by dint of being out only once that summer he averaged 50.00 with the bat. In 1969–71 Snow would make 276 runs (34.50) in Tests, so could be regarded as an all-rounder.|$|E
