Displacement ductility of HSC columns was evaluated in terms of their concrete and reinforcement strengths, bar arrangement, volumetric ratio of transverse reinforcement, and axial loading. The results indicated that the confinement requirements and displacement ductility in HSC columns are more sensitive than those in normal strength concrete columns. Moreover, ductility is descended by increasing concrete strength. However, it was possible to obtain ductile behavior in HSC columns through proper confinement.
