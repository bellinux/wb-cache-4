PC Zone agreed, but in a negative sense—it argued that The Age of Kings [...] "is essentially an update of a two-year-old game".|$|E
500|$|Writing for Mojo, James McNair {{described}} [...] "Northern Lites" [...] as {{a mix of}} [...] "Tijuana brass, steel drums, and itch-scratching Latin percussion" [...] {{and claimed}} that the [...] "great" [...] song was [...] "one of the most frothily inventive pop confections" [...] since Super Furry Animals' 1998 track, [...] "Ice Hockey Hair". In Q, reviewer Peter Kane stated that the song's combination of [...] "cheesy calypso sway" [...] and [...] "Tijuana brass" [...] <b>were</b> <b>wonderful.</b> Dave Simpson, writing in The Guardian, claimed that the song was [...] "possibly the first hit to be massively influenced by Tito Puente." [...] In The Independent, Tim Perry stated that the [...] "undeniably brilliant" [...] "Northern Lites" [...] {{was one of the}} highlights of the Guerrilla album. In a 2005 review of the reissued Guerrilla, Pitchfork's Marc Hogan described the track as [...] "horn-laden tropicalia"; in an earlier review of Songbook: The Singles, Vol. 1, he had called [...] "Northern Lites" [...] "'Deadweight'-era Beck tropicalia". Reviewing Songbook... for PopMatters, Zeth Lundy described [...] "Northern Lites" [...] as [...] "Brazilian-infected", while Ian Wade, reviewing the album for the BBC, called the song an [...] "indie/calypso crossover" [...] and Alan Woodhouse, reviewing Songbook... for the NME labelled the track an [...] "irresistible Caribbean-flavoured tune." [...] Marc Hogan of Pitchfork claimed that the single's b-sides, including the [...] "shiny, distorted mid-tempo number" [...] "This, That and the Other", pale beside [...] "Northern Lites" [...] and the other tracks on Guerilla although they [...] "do manage to scratch the itch for more SFA".|$|E

2500|$|From 1929 to 1938, John Scott Oliver, {{a wealthy}} industrialist, lived at Pembroke Lodge. During World War II, the GHQ Liaison Regiment (also known as Phantom) {{established}} its regimental headquarters nearby at The Richmond Hill Hotel, with its base (including the officers' mess and billet) at Pembroke Lodge. Some {{of the members}} of the squad went on to become privy councillors, law lords, judges, MPs, a commissioner of the Metropolitan Police (Sir Robert Mark) and actors– including David Niven, who remarked in a letter, [...] "these <b>were</b> <b>wonderful</b> days which I would not have missed for anything". After World War II, Pembroke Lodge became a government-run tea room.|$|E

He majored in Mathematical Sciences at Rice University in Houston, where in {{connection}} with his interest in cognition he took courses {{in a range of}} fields, including philosophy, anthropology, linguistics, religion, and sociology. [...] He has said that at Rice “I went through the catalog and took every course that mentioned 'knowledge' or 'cognition,' regardless of the department.” He would later write that “The courses that had the greatest influence on my later work were 'The philosophy of knowledge' (Konstantin Kolenda), 'Language, thought, and culture' (Stephen Tyler), and 'The radical sociology of knowledge' (Kenneth Leiter). My advisor was Ken Kennedy, who taught a fantastic course on compilers. Altogether, I took 40 courses in 13 departments, including six anthropology and three philosophy courses. Rice's teachers <b>were</b> <b>wonderful</b> lecturers who inspired you with their own enthusiasm and the clarity of their thought.” He was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and received a B.A. summa cum laude in 1974.|$|E

2500|$|A {{remarkable}} occurrence, which attracted wide-spread interest, {{was connected}} with the family of John Bell, who settled near what is now Adams Station about 1804. So great was the excitement that people came from hundreds of miles around to witness the manifestations of what was popularly known as the [...] "Bell Witch." [...] This witch {{was supposed to be}} some spiritual being having the voice and attributes of a woman. It was invisible to the eye, yet it would hold conversation and even shake hands with certain individuals. The freaks it performed <b>were</b> <b>wonderful,</b> and seemingly designed to annoy the family. It would take the sugar from the bowls, spill the milk, take the quilts from the beds, slap and pinch the children, and then laugh at the discomfiture of its victims. At first {{it was supposed to be}} a good spirit, but its subsequent acts, together with the curses with which it supplemented its remarks, proved the contrary. A volume might be written concerning the performances of this wonderful being, as they are now described by contemporaries and their descendants. That all this actually occurred will not be disputed, nor will a rational explanation be attempted. It is merely introduced as an example of superstition, strong in the minds of all but a few in those times, and not yet wholly extinct.|$|E
2500|$|BBC1 was relaunched on 18 February 1985 {{with a new}} look, new {{programming}} including Wogan, EastEnders and {{a revised}} schedule to help streamline and maintain viewers {{throughout the course of}} the evening. Grade started to gear most programmes to either on the hour or half past the hour, while Panorama and Omnibus were both moved after the Nine O'Clock News. Grade was also determined to end the dated and inept BBC1 scheduling which was hampering the network and which was holding back good programmes. Grade stated [...] "When I took over BBC1, I discovered there <b>were</b> <b>wonderful</b> things, it was just a case of where to put them." [...] Wogan had been scheduled for a 10pm slot, but Grade moved it to a 7pm slot as he believed the show had potential. From February to August 1985, a high amount of American mini series were broadcast while filming took place of a number of new home grown programmes, including 'Allo 'Allo!, In Sickness and in Health, and Open All Hours. Further improvement come about when the corporation strengthened its drama output costing £30 million, with eight new series, including Howards' Way, All Creatures Great and Small, Hold the Back Page, and Bluebill, along with the return of Bergerac and Big Deal. The increase in the drama department was achieved by switching the money away from the administrative service over a three-year period, after BBC1 was criticised, for failing in matching ITV's output in drama. EastEnders was moved to a 19:30 slot, where it managed to soar to 20 million, helping the BBC1 audience share increase to nearly 50% {{for the first time since}} 1982.|$|E
