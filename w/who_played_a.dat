5|$|Rumours {{of affairs}} did not {{surround}} only Bigge.

Louise was also romantically linked to fellow artist Edwin Lutyens; her equerry, Colonel William Probert; and an unnamed music master. However, Jehanne Wake, Louise's biographer, argues {{that there is no}} substantial evidence to suggest that Louise had sexual relationships with anyone other than her husband.|$|E

Gandasubrata recalled that Sjumandjaja fired his own father-in-law from Jakarta Opera when the latter could not perform to the director's expectations. According to producer Manoo Sukmajaya, Sjumandjaja would refuse to accept a directing offer if he found the script uninteresting, valuing creative worth over the director's fee.|$|E
