5|$|By {{the time}} George Luttrell {{inherited}} the castle in 1571, it was dilapidated, {{with the family}} preferring to live in their house, now known as Court House, at East Quantoxhead. In 1617 George employed the architect William Arnold, {{to create a new}} house in the Lower <b>Ward</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> castle. Arnold was an important architect in the south-west of England, and had managed the building of nearby Montacute and Cranborne House. The redesign expanded on some of the existing buildings and walls to create a 16th-century Jacobean mansion with a symmetrical front and square towers, set within the older castle walls and overlooked by the keep above. The building was decorated in the latest styles, including ornamental plaster ceilings. The project ran almost three times over budget, costing Luttrell more than £1,200.|$|E

Cassidy returns as a good ghost and befriends Jericho, aiding him in his mission to stop Lazarus (a role similar to this of Cortana in the Halo series). As a little girl, Cassidy was orphaned in a vampire attack and then raised as a <b>ward</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Darkwatch. Eventually, she became the most serious and dangerous agent in the organisation, yet really she is also deeply insecure about herself. If fought as the final boss, she turns into an angel.|$|E

He occasionally went back to Liverpool, but did not stay long before he was sent off on another ship. The cheques to Julia stopped when he went absent without leave in 1943. Neither Julia nor the Merchant Navy knew of his whereabouts. Julia only found out because she stopped receiving her allowance money, and the Navy wrote to her to inform her that they were looking for him.|$|E
