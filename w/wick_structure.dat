40|$|Thin-film {{evaporation}} in <b>wick</b> <b>structures</b> {{for cooling}} high-performance electronic devices is attractive because it harnesses the latent {{heat of vaporization}} and does not require external pumping. However, optimizing the <b>wick</b> <b>structures</b> to increase the dry-out heat flux is challenging due to the complexities in modeling the liquid–vapor interface and the flow through the <b>wick</b> <b>structures.</b> In this work, we developed a model for thin-film evaporation from micropillar array <b>wick</b> <b>structures</b> and validated the model with experiments. The model numerically simulates liquid velocity, pressure, and meniscus curvature along the wicking direction by conservation of mass, momentum, and energy based on a finite volume approach. Specifically, the three-dimensional meniscus shape, which varies along the wicking direction with the local liquid pressure, is accurately captured by a force balance using the Young–Laplace equation. The dry-out condition is determined when the minimum contact angle on the pillar surface reaches the receding contact angle as the applied heat flux increases. With this model, we predict the dry-out heat flux on various micropillar structure geometries (diameter, pitch, and height) in the length scale range of 1 – 100 μm and discuss the optimal geometries to maximize the dry-out heat flux. We also performed detailed experiments to validate the model predictions, which show good agreement.

40|$|Abstract only availableThe heating of {{household}} water, {{which consists of}} nearly 20 to 30 % of the average household's energy costs, has drastically increased in recent years. Solar water heaters have become popular to lower this cost, and one such system employs a thermosyphon system to collect solar energy and heat the water. Current market designs use a traditional thermosyphon with no <b>wick</b> <b>structure</b> inside. The purpose of this research project is {{to determine whether a}} thermosyphon with a helical-groove <b>wick</b> <b>structure</b> is better suited for a solar water heating system. Advantages for wick structures in thermosyphons include a decreased vapor-liquid interaction (preventing a condition called flooding), an aid to circumferential distribution of liquid in a tilted application, and to enhance condensation heat transfer in the condenser section. For this research, two thermosyphons are constructed; one with a smooth inner wall and one with a helical groove <b>wick</b> <b>structure.</b> Each thermosyphon is 10 mm in diameter, 1. 83 meters long, and constructed of copper tubing. The temperature of the condenser, adiabatic, and evaporator sections are monitored as the thermosyphon is tested under increasing thermal loads. The data collected is used to determine whether the surface area of the thermosyphon is sufficient to collect enough solar energy or if a heat sink is needed to provide sufficient surface area. The overall goal is to determine whether the advantages of the grooved <b>wick</b> <b>structure</b> provide a significant increase in performance over a traditional smooth-wall thermosyphon.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, Sandia National Laboratories has been {{involved}} in the development of receivers to transfer energy from the focus of a parabolic dish concentrator to the heater tubes of a Stirling engine. Through the isothermal evaporation and condensation of sodium. a heat-pipe receiver can efficiently transfer energy to an engine's working fluid and compensate for irregularities in the flux distribution that is delivered by the concentrator. The operation of the heat pipe is completely passive because the liquid sodium is distributed over the solar-heated surface by capillary pumping provided by a <b>wick</b> <b>structure.</b> Tests have shown that using a heat pipe can boost the system performance by twenty percent when compared to directly illuminating the engine heater tubes. Designing heat pipe solar receivers has presented several challenges. The relatively large area ({approximately} 0. 2 m{sup 2 }) of the receiver surface makes it difficult to design a wick that can continuously provide liquid sodium to all regions of the heated surface. Selecting a <b>wick</b> <b>structure</b> with smaller pores will improve capillary pumping capabilities of the wick, but the small pores will restrict the flow of liquid and generate high pressure drops. Selecting a wick that is comprised of very tine filaments can increase the permeability of the wick and thereby reduce flow losses, however, the fine <b>wick</b> <b>structure</b> is more susceptible to corrosion and mechanical damage. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the issues encountered in the design of heat pipe solar receivers and solutions to problems that have arisen.

Novel fabrication processes was developed that uses liquid crystal polymer (LCP) film with copper filled thermal vias and a micro-scale hybrid liquid <b>wicking</b> <b>structure</b> to construct a flat heat pipe suitable for thermal management of semiconductor devices.

The microfabrication techniques of photolithography and reactive ion etching were used to form copper filled thermal vias through the polymer to decrease thermal resistance of the casing. Photolithography, wet etching, and electroplating were used to form a hybrid wicking consisting of 200 µm copper pillar forming 31 µm grooves with a woven copper mesh bonded to the top surface. In addition, a novel method for bonding woven metallic mesh to liquid flow channels has been developed. A 250 Å thick layer of atomic layer deposited (ALD) TiO 2 was coated on the hybrid <b>wicking</b> <b>structure</b> to enhance the evaporation and capillary force on the liquid in the device.

The longitudinal {{slot in the}} heat pipe wall which interconnects the heat pipe vapor space with the external artery is completely filled with sintered wick material and {{the wall of the}} external artery is also covered with sintered wick material. This added <b>wick</b> <b>structure</b> assures that the external artery will continue to feed liquid to the heat pipe evaporator even if a vapor bubble forms within and would otherwise block the liquid transport function of the external artery...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} effort for, and the fabrication and testing of, six CTS-type variable conductance heat pipes is described. The heat pipes are constructed of stainless steel, use methanol {{as a working}} fluid, and a nitrogen/helium mixture as the control gas. The <b>wicking</b> <b>structure</b> consists of interior wall grooves, a metal-felt diametral slab wick, and two wire-mesh arteries. The heat pipes are used to cool two Functional Model/Power Processing Units in a Solar Electric Propulsion prototype BIMOD thruster subsystem assembly. The Power Processing Units convert the electric power from a spacecraft solar array system to the voltages required to operate the electric thrusters which {{are part of the}} BIMOD assembly...|$|R
40|$|Polymer based <b>wicking</b> <b>structures</b> were {{fabricated}} by sintering powders of polycarbonate (PC), ultra-high {{molecular weight}} polyethylene and polyamide 12, aiming at selecting a suitable material for an innovative electroencephalography (EEG) bio-electrode. Preliminary experiments showed that PC based wicks displayed the best mechanical properties, therefore more detailed studies {{were carried out}} with PC to evaluate the influence of powder granulometry and processing parameters (pressure, temperature and time) on the mechanical properties, porosity, mean pore radius and permeability of the wicks. It was concluded that the mechanical properties are significantly enhanced by increasing the processing time and pressure, although at the expense of a significant decrease of porosity and mean pore diameter (and thus permeability), particularly for the highest applied pressures (74 kPa). However, a good compromise between porosity/permeability and mechanical properties could be obtained by sintering PC powders of particle sizes below 500 μm at 165 °C for 5 min, upon an applied pressure of 56 kPa. Moreover, PC proved to be chemically stable in contact with an EEG common used disinfectant. Thus, <b>wicking</b> <b>structures</b> with appropriate properties for the fabrication of reusable bio-electrodes could be fabricated from the sintering of PC powders.
