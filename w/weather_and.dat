50|$|Mesas form by <b>weathering</b> <b>and</b> {{erosion of}} {{horizontally}} layered rocks {{that have been}} uplifted by tectonic activity. Variations {{in the ability of}} different types of rock to resist <b>weathering</b> <b>and</b> erosion cause the weaker types of rocks to be eroded away, leaving the more resistant types of rocks topographically higher than their surroundings. This process is called differential erosion. The most resistant rock types include sandstone, conglomerate, quartzite, basalt, chert, limestone, lava flows and sills. Lava flows and sills, in particular, are very resistant to <b>weathering</b> <b>and</b> erosion, and often form the flat top, or caprock, of a mesa. The less resistant rock layers are mainly made up of shale, a softer rock that <b>weathers</b> <b>and</b> erodes more easily.|$|R

40|$|Aging <b>and</b> <b>weathering</b> {{can reduce}} the solar {{reflectance}} of cool roofing materials. This paper summarizes laboratory measurements of the solar spectral reflectance of unweathered, <b>weathered,</b> <b>and</b> cleaned samples collected from single-ply roofing membranes at various sites across the United States. Fifteen samples were examined {{in each of the}} following six conditions: unweathered; weathered; <b>weathered</b> <b>and</b> brushed; <b>weathered,</b> brushed <b>and</b> then rinsed with water; weathered, brushed, rinsed with water, and then washed with soap <b>and</b> water; <b>and</b> <b>weathered,</b> brushed, rinsed with water, washed with soap and water, and then washed with an algaecide. Another 25 samples from 25 roofs across the United States and Canada were measured in their unweathered state, <b>weathered,</b> <b>and</b> <b>weathered</b> <b>and</b> wiped. We document reduction in reflectivity resulted from various soiling mechanisms and provide data on the effectiveness of various cleaning approaches. Results indicate that although the majority of samples after being washed with detergent could be brought to within 90 % of their unweathered reflectivity, in some instances an algaecide was required to restore this level of reflectivity...|$|R

5|$|A rugged, sparsely {{populated}} area, the Catlins features a scenic coastal landscape and dense temperate rainforest, {{both of which}} harbour many endangered species of birds, most notably the rare yellow-eyed penguin. The coast attracts numerous marine mammals, among them New Zealand fur seals and Hooker's sea lions. In general terms the area enjoys a maritime temperate climate. Its exposed location leads to its frequently wild <b>weather</b> <b>and</b> heavy ocean swells, which are an attraction to big-wave surfers, and have also caused numerous shipwrecks.|$|E

Meanwhile, the Allied supply system grappled with the problems of terrain and climate, particularly inclement <b>weather</b> <b>and</b> rough monsoonal seas that hampered and occasionally prevented delivery of supplies by sea.|$|E

Although Stroma lies only a few miles off the Scottish coast, the savage <b>weather</b> <b>and</b> ferociously strong tides of the Pentland Firth meant that the island's inhabitants were very isolated, causing them to be largely self-sufficient, trading agricultural produce and fish with the mainlanders.|$|E
