5|$|Aside {{from the}} obvious – Keith Moon, John Bonham, Ian Paice – I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> Tony Williams, Elvin Jones, {{any of the}} jazz greats – Gene Krupa, those people. I think, more and more, as I get older, I've {{developed}} my own rock style and I tend to pull more stuff from Elvin Jones and Tony now that I can incorporate it into a rock arena and kind of modernize it.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{problems}} during production, the album remained Wright's favourite: [...] "It's an album I {{can listen to}} for pleasure, and there aren't many Floyd albums that I can." [...] Gilmour shares this view: [...] "I for one <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that it is my favourite album, the Wish You Were Here album. [...] The end result of all that, whatever it was, definitely has left me an album I can live with very very happily. [...] I like it very much." ...|$|E

500|$|Wilco {{signed to}} Reprise Records while Son Volt signed with Warner Bros. Records. Son Volt had an early college rock hit with [...] "Drown" [...] from the album Trace, but Wilco {{maintained}} a more commercially successful {{career in the}} years to follow. Regarding the possibility of a reunion, Mike Heidorn reported in a PopMatters interview that [...] "nothing's ever for sure, but I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> 'No such thing'". Farrar said that he does not want the band to get back together, while Tweedy said that he believes that a reunion would not be productive musically.|$|E
500|$|... "Dream On" [...] {{was filmed}} in March 2010. In October 2009, Michael Ausiello of Entertainment Weekly {{reported}} that 20th Century Fox, the studio behind Glee, had approached Joss Whedon about directing an episode during the show's first season. Series creator Ryan Murphy {{is a fan}} of Whedon's work, and praised the musical episode of his series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, commenting: [...] "Joss directed one of the great musical episodes in the history of television on Buffy, so this is a great, if unexpected, fit. I'm thrilled he'll be loaning us his fantastic groundbreaking talent." [...] Whedon deemed Glee his favorite television show, but downplayed his influence over the episode. Asked by Ileane Rudolph of TV Guide whether the episode would feature songs from Buffy, or his 2008 musical Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog, Whedon replied: [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> a resonant 'no way.' The episode isn't about me. It's the next episode of Glee. Hopefully my hands will be invisible on the show." [...] Whedon felt that his job was to be anonymous: [...] "to find the most compelling way to present a story without calling attention to himself." [...] He acknowledged his proclivity for killing off fans' favorite characters, jesting that he planned to murder Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba).|$|E
500|$|According to Jon Pareles of The New York Times, [...] "after all {{the nuances}} Madonna {{has brought to}} the role of the bad girl, it's strange that she would settle now for such a restricted, unexamined version of respectability" [...] and [...] "for the first time, Madonna has let the deal dictate the music". Tan Gim Ean from New Straits Times noted that Madonna played against her {{strengths}} on the songs of the album. He described her vocals as [...] "competent", but felt that the songs required [...] "more range and agility than Madonna has at her disposal." [...] Dave Tianen from Milwaukee Journal Sentinel described the album as a [...] "mixed bag of period pieces, some of them too cute for their own good", adding that [...] "I'm Breathless never becomes more than the sum of its mannerisms". AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine claimed that the songs are just [...] "cutesy novelty numbers", and listing [...] "Vogue" [...] as a standout track. Rooksby panned the album, saying that it [...] "failed to transcend the sterile, preserved-in-amber quality of pastiche". Mark Cooper from Q magazine lamented, in its June 1990 review, [...] "It's something of a disappointment because the lady herself stays so firmly committed to a character who's less original than the persona she evolved during the '80s." [...] Nonetheless, in the same magazine's December 1994 issue, Madonna declared: [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> the favorite record that I've made is the soundtrack to Dick Tracy. I love every one of those songs... My judgment is never based on the world's reaction." ...|$|E

6000|$|The second {{boy said}} it was a [...] "green wood." [...] This annoyed the Professor still more; he called the second boy a blockhead, though really I cannot see why, and passed on to the third, who, for the last minute, had been sitting {{apparently}} on hot plates, with his right arm waving up and down like a distracted semaphore signal. He <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it the next second, whether the Professor had asked him or not; he was red in the face, holding his knowledge in.|$|R

He's a special talent, a rare breed and I believe he's going to do really well in the WWE".|$|E
2500|$|When it {{was decided}} to make the movie about his life called Serpico, Al Pacino invited Serpico to stay with him at a house that Pacino had rented in Montauk, New York. When Pacino asked why he had stepped forward, Serpico replied, [...] "Well, Al, I don't know. I guess I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it would be because... if I didn't, who would I be when I listened to a piece of music?" [...] He has {{credited}} his grandfather who had once been assaulted and robbed and his uncle, a respected policeman in Italy, with his sense of justice.|$|E
2500|$|Ray Gambell, {{then the}} Secretary of the IWC, agreed {{at least in}} part with the {{argument}} of the pro-whaling nations: [...] "In all reasonableness, we <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that a commercial catch could be taken without endangering [...] stocks." [...] In June 1993 the Chairman of the Scientific Committee, Dr Philip Hammond, resigned in protest to what he saw as contempt of the Scientific Committee's recommendations. The same year Norway became the only state in the world to resume commercial whaling, {{on the grounds that they}} had objected to, and thus opted out, of the moratorium.|$|E

2500|$|Dale Sheets and Universal Studios. Patterson, Gimlin, and DeAtley {{screened}} {{the film}} for Dale Sheets, {{head of the}} Documentary Film Department, and unnamed technicians [...] "in the special effects department at Universal Studios in Hollywood ... Their conclusion was: 'We could try (faking it), but {{we would have to}} create a completely new system of artificial muscles and find an actor who could be trained to walk like that. It might be done, but we <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that it would be almost impossible.'" [...] A more moderate version of their opinion was, [...] "if it is , it's a very good one—a job that would {{take a lot of time}} and money to produce." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the second}} day of the trial, Dr. Thomas Andrew, who is Chief Medical Examiner of New Hampshire, said Martin Lee Anderson died as a result of the boot camp guards' actions. [...] He said that {{everything}} combined, including the stress of the encounter and the physical exertion of the run, aggravated Anderson's sickle-cell condition, hampering the flow of oxygen in his blood. [...] "But for these defendants' actions, would Martin Anderson have died?" [...] assistant state attorney Scott Harmon asked. [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> no," [...] Andrew said. [...] He also said that, had the guards given Anderson the opportunity to recover from the run, his death might have been prevented ...|$|E
2500|$|Mitchell's {{work has}} had an {{influence}} on many other artists, including Katy Perry, Ellie Goulding, Corinne Bailey Rae, Gabrielle Aplin, Mikael Åkerfeldt from Opeth, Marillion members Steve Hogarth and Steve Rothery, their former vocalist and lyricist Fish, Paul Carrack, Haim, and Taylor Swift. Madonna has also cited Mitchell as the first female artist that really spoke {{to her as a}} teenager; [...] "I was really, really into Joni Mitchell. I knew every word to Court and Spark; I worshipped her when I was in high school. Blue is amazing. I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> of all the women I've heard, she had the most profound effect on me from a lyrical point of view." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{album was}} a {{farewell}} to Petra's first era of popularity {{and the sound}} it had cultivated with Volz's distinctive vocals. As constant touring took its toll on the band, Hartman and Volz began to disagree about Petra's future, both on stage and off. The tour, while it drew more fans than ever, was expensive, and it left Petra hurting financially. Increased competition from other Christian rock bands, for whom Petra had paved the way, led to lower-than-expected showings as the tour went on. As Hartman told CCM Magazine in 1986, [...] "If I had {{to put it in}} a nutshell without getting too deep, I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it's business. Greg and I agree on just about everything except business." ...|$|E
2500|$|In The New York Times on April 3, 1966, Moyers {{offered this}} insight on his stint as press {{secretary}} to President Johnson: [...] "I {{work for him}} despite his faults and he lets me work for him despite my deficiencies." [...] On October 17, 1967, he told an audience in Cambridge that Johnson saw the war in Vietnam as his major legacy and, as a result, was insisting on victory at all costs, {{even in the face}} of public opposition. Moyers felt such a continuation of the conflict would tear the country apart. [...] "I never thought the situation could arise when I would wish for the defeat of LBJ, and that makes my current state of mind all the more painful to me," [...] he told them. [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> now: It would depend on who his opponent is." ...|$|E
2500|$|Promoted to full {{general in}} 1962, he was {{assigned}} as vice {{chief of staff of}} the U.S. Army amid speculation that he would soon succeed Army chief of staff George H. Decker, who was not expected to be reappointed. As vice chief of staff, Hamlett negotiated the creation of U.S. Strike Command with Air Force chief of staff Curtis E. LeMay, played a key role in Army operations during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and participated in the escalation of the Vietnam War. Reflecting on this period later, Hamlett said, [...] "I think the most important thing was something I didn't recommend; and that was that we didn't become involved in Vietnam to the point where we would have to commit combat forces. I think it was a failure, and I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that I shared the responsibility because I didn't see far enough ahead to speak out." ...|$|E
6000|$|Their {{heads were}} close together, their fingers often met; he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> liked <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something, {{but he could}} only add: [...] "Are you sure you will feel quite safe? It is a little steeper as we near the bank." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Heavy?" [...] cried Buzzby, whose {{appearance}} {{was such that}} you <b>would</b> <b>have</b> hesitated <b>to</b> <b>say</b> whether his breadth or length was greater,--"heavy, d'ye say? It must be your sperrits wot's heavy, then, for I feel as light as a feather myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am afraid," [...] he {{answered}} smiling, [...] "that {{there are other}} people who <b>would</b> <b>have</b> something <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about that. Your stepmother is already anxious. I have promised that you shall be back at the Hall by ten o'clock." ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{the first}} experiment, words and conflict-words were used (see first figure). The task {{required}} {{the participants to}} read the written color names of the words independently {{of the color of}} the ink (for example, they would have to read [...] "purple" [...] no matter what the color of the font). In experiment 2, stimulus conflict-words and color patches were used, and participants were required to say the ink-color of the letters independently of the written word with the second kind of stimulus and also name the color of the patches. If the word [...] "purple" [...] was written in red font, they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> [...] "red", rather than [...] "purple". When the squares were shown, the participant spoke the name of the color. Stroop, in the third experiment, tested his participants at different stages of practice at the tasks and stimuli used in the first and second experiments, examining learning effects.|$|E
2500|$|In October 1974, Benny {{cancelled}} {{a performance}} in Dallas {{after suffering a}} dizzy spell, coupled with numbness in his arms. Despite a battery of tests, Benny's ailment could not be determined. When he complained of stomach pains in early December, a first test showed nothing, but a subsequent one showed he had inoperable pancreatic cancer. Benny went into a coma at home on December 22, 1974. While in a coma, he was visited by close friends including George Burns, Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Johnny Carson and John Rowles. He died on December 26, 1974 at age 80. At the funeral George Burns, Benny's best friend for more than fifty years, attempted to deliver a eulogy but broke down shortly after he began {{and was unable to}} continue. Bob Hope also delivered a eulogy in which he stated, [...] "For a man who was the undisputed master of comedy timing, you <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> this is the only time when Jack Benny's timing was all wrong. He left us much too soon." [...] He was interred in a crypt at Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City, California. As a tribute to his skinflint stage persona, visitors often leave pennies on his crypt. [...] Benny's will arranged for a single long-stemmed red rose, to be delivered to his widow, Mary Livingstone, every day {{for the rest of her}} life. Livingstone died nine years later on June 30, 1983.|$|E
2500|$|Zakaria {{initially}} {{supported the}} 2003 invasion of Iraq. He {{said at the}} time, [...] "The place is so dysfunctional ... any stirring of the pot is good. America's involvement {{in the region is}} for the good." [...] He argued for a United Nations–sanctioned operation with a much larger force—approximately 400,000 troops—than was actually employed by the administration of President George W. Bush. However, he soon became a critic. In addition to objecting to the war plan, he frequently criticized the way the Bush administration was running the occupation of Iraq. He argued against the disbanding of the army and bureaucracy yet supported the de-Baathification programs. He continued to argue that a functioning democracy in Iraq would be a powerful new model for Arab politics but suggested that an honest accounting <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the costs of the invasion had been much higher than the benefits. He opposed the Iraq surge in March 2007, writing that it would work militarily but not politically, still leaving Iraq divided among its three communities. Instead he advocated that Washington push hard for a political settlement between the Sunni Arabs, Shia Arabs, and Kurds, and begin a reduction in forces to only 60,000 troops. He later wrote that the surge [...] "succeeded" [...] militarily but that it did not produce a political compact and that Iraq remains divided along sectarian lines, undermining its unity, democracy, and legacy.|$|E
