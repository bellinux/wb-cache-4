5|$|Most vertebrates—the amphibians, the {{reptiles}} {{and some}} mammals such as humans and bears—are plantigrade, <b>walking</b> <b>on</b> {{the whole of}} the underside of the foot. Many mammals, such as cats and dogs, are digitigrade, <b>walking</b> <b>on</b> their toes, the greater stride length allowing more speed. Digitigrade mammals are also often adept at quiet movement. Some animals such as horses are unguligrade, <b>walking</b> <b>on</b> the tips of their toes. This even further increases their stride length and thus their speed. A few mammals, namely the great apes, are also known to walk on their knuckles, at least for their front legs. Giant anteaters and platypuses are also knuckle-walkers. Some mammals are bipeds, using only two limbs for locomotion, which can be seen in, for example, humans and the great apes. Bipedal species have a larger field of vision than quadrupeds, conserve more energy and have the ability to manipulate objects with their hands, which aids in foraging. Instead of walking, some bipeds hop, such as kangaroos and kangaroo rats.|$|E

Views of people holding {{instruments}} and <b>walking</b> <b>on</b> the street are shown, in addition to scenes where Rihanna and Drake are in a bedroom together, flirting, talking and drinking champagne.

The video ends with Drake kissing Rihanna on her cheek in the bedroom.|$|E

5|$|Maine Coons {{have several}} {{physical}} adaptations for survival in harsh winter climates. Their dense water-resistant fur is longer and shaggier on their underside and rear for extra protection {{when they are}} walking or {{sitting on top of}} wet surfaces of snow or ice. Their long and bushy raccoon-like tail is resistant to sinking in snow, and can be curled around their face and shoulders for warmth and protection from wind and blowing snow and it can even be curled around their backside like an insulated seat cushion when sitting down on a snow or ice surface. Large paws, and especially the extra-large paws of polydactyl Maine Coons, facilitate <b>walking</b> <b>on</b> snow and are often compared to snowshoes. Long tufts of fur growing between their toes help keep the toes warm and further aid <b>walking</b> <b>on</b> snow by giving the paws additional structure without significant extra weight. Heavily furred ears with extra long tufts of fur growing from inside help keep their ears warm.|$|E

5|$|There was {{considerable}} debate whether pterosaurs ambulated as quadrupeds or as bipeds. In the 1980s, paleontologist Kevin Padian suggested that smaller pterosaurs with longer hindlimbs, such as Dimorphodon, might have walked or even run bipedally, {{in addition to}} flying, like road runners. However, {{a large number of}} pterosaur trackways were later found with a distinctive four-toed hind foot and three-toed front foot; these are the unmistakable prints of pterosaurs <b>walking</b> <b>on</b> all fours.|$|E

5|$|Three {{of the six}} prion {{species have}} bills filled with lamellae, which act as filters to sift {{zooplankton}} from the water. Water is forced through the lamellae and small prey items are collected. This technique is often {{used in conjunction with}} a method known as hydroplaning where the bird dips its bill beneath the surface and propels itself forward with wings and feet as if <b>walking</b> <b>on</b> the water.|$|E
5|$|A {{music video}} {{for the song}} was filmed in late May, co-directed by the singer and her {{production}} team, Haus of Gaga. The video is simple in contrast to much of Gaga's previous work, and portrays her dancing on a fire-escape and <b>walking</b> <b>on</b> a lonely street. Differences include the lack of intricate choreography and back-up dancers, as well as using only one outfit designed by Versace. Critics lauded {{the simplicity of the}} video, while comparing it to the works of Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson and Madonna. Gaga has performed the song in award shows, music festivals and her concert tours.|$|E

This is followed by her own and her partner holding each other closely in bed, sitting on different sides of a large bed, and other scenes featuring Rihanna singing through sheer curtains and drapery. In the video there are also black-white scenes showing Rihanna touching to a stone wall.|$|E

5|$|Although fewer postcranial remains {{have been}} {{discovered}} for Hadropithecus than for Archaeolemur, what has been found indicates that both were adapted for a terrestrial or semi-terrestrial lifestyle, an unusual trait for lemurs. Both genera had short limbs and a powerful build. Due to its specialized dentition and likely diet, Hadropithecus {{is thought to have}} been the more terrestrial of the two, since Archaeolemur may have sent more time foraging and sleeping in the trees. Both genera also have shortened hands and feet, an adaptation for <b>walking</b> <b>on</b> the ground.|$|E
5|$|Another {{music video}} for the Maanstudio remix {{version of the}} song was shot by Ciprian Strugariu and {{uploaded}} onto MediaPro Music's YouTube channel on 9 December 2011. Andra Moga and Violeta Irimia were credited for styling and make-up, respectively. The visual starts with angle shots of the singer lying on sand, followed by her <b>walking</b> <b>on</b> a field wearing a black dress. Subsequently, the singer poses {{in front of a}} stonewall and performs to the song sporting a transparent jacket and a black leotard. The last scenes show her on a swing, swimming while a sea storm takes place, and her posing in front of a body of water with a black bodysuit on.|$|E
5|$|Because {{its feet}} are located so far {{back on its}} body, the red-throated loon is quite clumsy <b>walking</b> <b>on</b> land, but it can use its feet to shove itself forward on its breast.

It is the only species of loon able to take off directly from land. If frightened, it may submerge until only its head or bill shows above {{the surface of the}} water.|$|E

5|$|Farewell Great Macedon (also {{known as}} Alexander the Great in the script's early stages) was a six-part story pitched for Season 1 and {{was written by}} Moris Farhi.

The script was published by Nothing at the End of the Lane in October 2009. It was later adapted by Nigel Robinson for Big Finish's The Lost Stories range in November 2010.|$|E
5|$|Fishers {{have five}} toes on each foot, with unsheathed, {{retractable}} claws. Their feet are disproportionately large for their legs, {{making it easier}} for them to move on top of snow packs. In addition to the toes, there are four central pads on each foot. On the hind paws there are coarse hairs that grow between the pads and the toes, giving them added traction when <b>walking</b> <b>on</b> a variety of surfaces. Fishers have highly mobile ankle joints that can rotate their hind paws almost 180 degrees, allowing them to maneuver well in trees and climb down head-first. The fisher is one of relatively few mammalian species with the ability to descend trees head-first.|$|E

5|$|Furthermore, {{it appears}} that Iguanodon became more quadrupedal as it got older and heavier; {{juvenile}} I. bernissartensis have shorter arms than adults (60% of hindlimb length versus 70% for adults). When walking as a quadruped, the animal's hands would have been held so that the palms faced each other, as shown by iguanodontian trackways and the anatomy of this genus's arms and hands. The three toed pes (foot) of Iguanodon was relatively long, and when walking, both the hand and the foot would {{have been used in}} a digitigrade fashion (<b>walking</b> <b>on</b> the fingers and toes). The maximum speed of Iguanodon has been estimated at , which would have been as a biped; {{it would not have been}} able to gallop as a quadruped.|$|E
