5|$|Djibouti was {{represented}} by one male athlete at the 2008 Olympics in athletics: Mahamoud Farah, a 1500 meters runner. It was Farah's Olympic debut but he had previously competed in the 2007 IAAF World Championships. He competed on 15 August in Beijing, and finished 8th out of 12 in heat four {{in a time of}} 3minutes and 43.62seconds. He was 8.83seconds behind the winner of his heat, Mohamed Moustaoui. Overall he finished 42nd out of 53 athletes, and he was 1.32seconds slower than the slowest athlete that progressed to the semi-final round and, therefore, that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> his competition.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} premiere of , Jerry Bruckheimer stated it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the trilogy, {{but the idea of}} a {{spin-off}} was still possible. After the film's successful opening weekend, Dick Cook, then Chairman of the Walt Disney Studios, said he was interested in a fourth installment. Los Angeles Times also reported that rights to a book were bought. Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio had started working on a script in 2007, but they were interrupted by the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, and only resumed in mid-2008.|$|E
50|$|Termination, as used by Quaternary geologists, oceanographers, and paleoclimatologists <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{period of}} time during an glacial cycle {{when there is a}} {{relatively}} rapid transition from full glacial climates to full interglacial climates. For the Quaternary period, terminations are numbered using Roman numerals from the most recent termination as “I” and with increasing value, e.g. “II”, “III”, and so forth, into the past. Termination I, also known as the Last Glacial Termination, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> Marine isotope stage 2; Termination II <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> Marine Isotope Stage 6; Termination III <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> Marine Isotope Stage 8; Termination IV <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> Marine Isotope Stage 10, and so forth.|$|R

5|$|The 1939–40 {{season was}} Bradman's most {{productive}} ever for SA: 1,448runs {{at an average}} of 144.8. He made three double centuries, including 251 not out against NSW, the innings that he rated the best he ever played in the Sheffield Shield, as he tamed Bill O'Reilly {{at the height of his}} form. However, it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> an era. The outbreak of World War Two led to the indefinite postponement of all cricket tours, and the suspension of the Sheffield Shield competition.|$|E
5|$|This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> U.S. air support, {{the last}} American {{aircraft}} departing Cambodian airspace on 15 August. From {{the beginning of}} Operation Breakfast the U.S. Air Force had dropped 539,129 tons of ordnance on Cambodia, 257,465 tons {{of which had been}} dropped during the last six months of the operation. During 1974, Cambodia continued to collapse. More than half of the population had become refugees and malnutrition and disease stalked a nation that had once been the best fed in Southeast Asia.|$|E
5|$|Though Lieder {{herself has}} not {{specified}} a new {{date for the}} object's return, many groups have taken up her idea and cited their own dates. One frequently cited date was December 21, 2012. This date had many apocalyptic associations, as it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a cycle (baktun) in the long count in the Mayan calendar. Several writers published books connecting the encounter with 2012. Despite that date having passed, many websites still contend that Nibiru/Planet X is en route to Earth.|$|E

5|$|Turboliners debuted on the Hiawatha {{corridor}} on June 1, 1975, {{and more}} trainsets began operating in 1976. As with the St. Louis and Detroit corridors, Amtrak dropped individual names {{in favor of}} the Turboliner branding in 1976, but reinstated these names in 1980. Turboliner equipment was withdrawn altogether in 1981. Their withdrawal <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> Turboliner service in the Midwest.|$|E
5|$|Berryman {{was later}} {{nominated}} for a bar to his Distinguished Service Order for the September 1918 fighting, but this was subsequently downgraded to a second Mention in Despatches. He {{was wounded in the}} right eye in September 1918 while he was commanding the 14th Field Artillery Battery. Although his wound was serious enough to warrant hospitalisation, there was no permanent damage to his vision. However, it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> his career as a battery commander, as the Army took the opportunity to transfer him to a staff post. From 28 October 1918 to 1 July 1919, he was Brigade Major of the 7th Infantry Brigade. With the war over, he returned to Australia in October 1919.|$|E
5|$|Dukovac did {{not meet}} further success until 25 May, when he claimed two Supermarine Spitfire V fighters {{southeast}} of Temryuk. Two days later, he and two other pilots surprised eight LaGG-3s west of Trarehof, all of them claiming one, although Dukovac's claim was not witnessed. On 30 May, he was on another He 111 escort mission when he accounted for another LaGG-3. At this juncture there were a spate of defections from 15./JG 52, with pilots flying to Soviet airfields. The remaining pilots were questioned by the Luftwaffe, the Staffel was withdrawn from the front, and {{the commander of the}} HZL was replaced. This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the second tour of 15./JG 52 on the Eastern Front, during which Dukovac had claimed 14 confirmed and six unconfirmed kills, five of which were later confirmed.|$|E

5|$|In 1503, Cairano {{made the}} last {{deliveries}} in the Caesar cycle {{for the front}} of the Loggia palace, and finished up the bulk of his work on the site; no further records of his presence exist. For the artist, this <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> his big public commissions, which he probably gained before establishing his career and subsequent success. He now had to reorganise his business and set up closer ties with the contacts he made during his work at the Loggia, including co-workers and other artists in and around Brescia, looking for major commissions. However, his path appeared to lead him increasingly toward sacred art. In 1504, the canon of the Basilica of San Pietro de Dom, Francisco Franzi of Orzinuovi bequeathed the construction of a chapel in the cathedral. Nothing further is known of this commission.|$|E
5|$|In August 1960, Clements {{met with}} Combs {{and told him}} he wanted to resign to work for the vice-presidential {{campaign}} of Lyndon Johnson. Combs called a press conference and announced that Clements' resignation would be effective September 1 and that he would be replaced by Henry Ward. The resignation <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the Clements faction of the state Democratic party. His split with Combs was so severe that he allied with his longtime foe, Happy Chandler, against the new Combs faction of the party. In the 1962 senatorial race, Clements opposed Wilson Wyatt's challenge to Senator Thruston Morton. Morton won re-election, ending Wyatt's political career. Chandler again sought the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1963. Clements appeared on stage with Chandler at a rally where Chandler claimed that Combs had arranged the truck deal to discredit Clements. Chandler hoped to damage Combs' reputation and, by extension, that of his hand-picked successor Edward T. Breathitt. His strategy was unsuccessful; Breathitt carried the primary and {{went on to win the}} general election. Clements' waning influence was evidenced by the fact that Breathitt carried Union County by a vote of 2,528 to 1,913.|$|E
5|$|Like most {{legislation}} of its kind, {{the act of}} 1891 {{imposed a}} time limit for the compulsory purchase of land and the raising of capital. The original date specified for completion of construction <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> 1896, but {{the time required to}} raise the finance and purchase station sites meant that construction had not begun by the start of that year. To give itself extra time, the CLR had obtained an extension of time to 1899 by the Central London Railway Act, 1894. Construction works were let by the ETCL as three sub-contracts: Shepherd's Bush to Marble Arch, Marble Arch to St Martin's Le Grand and St Martin's Le Grand to Bank. Work began with demolition of buildings at the Chancery Lane site in April 1896 and construction shafts were started at Chancery Lane, Shepherd's Bush, Stanhope Terrace and Bloomsbury in August and September 1896.|$|E

5|$|Making his Summer Olympics debut, Yazaldes Nascimento {{qualified}} for the 2004 Athens Games as a wildcard, without competing in any notable sporting event. He competed on 21 August in Heat 1 against seven other athletes. He ran a time of 11.00 seconds, finishing last of the eight athletes competing. Singapore's Poh Seng Song placed ahead of him {{with a time of}} 10.75 seconds, in a heat led by Namibia's Frank Fredericks who posted a time of 10.12 seconds, 0.88 seconds quicker than Nascimento's time. Out of 84 athletes, Nascimento ranked 67th and was 0.65 seconds behind the slowest athlete that progressed to the quarter-finals. Therefore, that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> his competition.|$|E
5|$|The {{capture of}} the Dutch ships <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the final attempt by a {{continental}} nation to land troops in Ireland during the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars that followed them. Furie and Waakzaamheid were both purchased for the Royal Navy, Furie returned to her pre-war name of Wilhelmina and Waakzaamheid under the same name. The corvette was regraded {{and the number of}} guns aboard were reduced to 20 as her frame was not deemed strong enough to carry 24. Richard King remained in Sirius until 1802, and subsequently commanded the ship of the line HMS Achille, participating at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805.|$|E
5|$|The first NZRFU sanctioned New Zealand {{team was}} formed to tour New South Wales and Queensland in 1893, and Ellison was {{selected}} as their captain. Three {{other members of the}} New Zealand Natives' team were also selected for the side. Ellison played seven matches on the tour, including matches against New South Wales and Queensland. The team won ten of their eleven matches—the one loss being to New South Wales in Sydney. In addition to scoring two tries, Ellison kicked six conversions and a goal from a mark to give him 23 points for the tour—the second highest of any player. The tour <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> his participation in the sport as a player.|$|E

The conventional system of posting reservists to their own regiment worked until April 1900, after which it became sometimes necessary to post reservists to different regiments due to heavy losses, and by September 1900 this system had broken down entirely, with the reserves entirely exhausted of men.|$|E
