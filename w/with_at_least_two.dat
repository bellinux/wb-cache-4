5|$|Babakotia radofilai and {{all other}} sloth lemurs share many traits with living sloths, demonstrating {{convergent}} evolution. It had long forearms, curved digits, and highly mobile hip and ankle joints. Its skull was more heavily built than that of indriids, {{but not as much}} as in the larger sloth lemurs. Its dentition is similar to that of all other indriids and sloth lemurs. It lived in the northern part of Madagascar and shared its range <b>with</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> other sloth lemur species, Palaeopropithecus ingens and Mesopropithecus dolichobrachion. Babakotia radofilai was primarily a leaf-eater (folivore), though it also ate fruit and hard seeds. It is known only from subfossil remains and may have died out shortly after the arrival of humans on the island, but not enough radiocarbon dating has been done with this species to know for certain.|$|E
5|$|On October 26 at AT Park, in a 5-0 {{win over}} the Royals in Game 5 of the World Series, Bumgarner pitched his second career postseason complete-game shutout, another four-hit shutout on the 2014 postseason, {{becoming}} the second pitcher in franchise history with two shutouts in a single postseason after Christy Mathewson's three shutouts in the 1905 World Series and the first San Francisco Giants pitcher to toss a complete-game shutout in a World Series game since Jack Sanford in Game 2 of the 1962 World Series, according to Fox. In addition, according to Fox Sports, Bumgarner is the fourth left-handed pitcher <b>with</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> shutouts in a single postseason, joining Whitey Ford, Sandy Koufax, and former teammate Randy Johnson.

5|$|On Sunday 30 September, {{the body}} of prostitute Elizabeth Stride was {{discovered}} at about 1am in Dutfield's Yard, inside the gateway of 40 Berner Street (since renamed Henriques Street), Whitechapel. She was lying {{in a pool of}} blood with her throat cut from left to right. She had been killed just minutes before, and her body was otherwise unmutilated. It is possible that the murderer was disturbed before he could commit any mutilation of the body by someone entering the yard, perhaps Louis Diemschutz, who discovered the body. However, some commentators on the case conclude that Stride's murder was unconnected to the others on the basis that the body was unmutilated, that it was the only murder to occur south of Whitechapel Road, and that the blade used might have been shorter and of a different design. Most experts, however, consider the similarities in the case distinctive enough to connect Stride's murder <b>with</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> of the earlier ones, as well as that of Catherine Eddowes on the same night.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of farming {{is reflected in}} the age of many of the farmhouses. Manor Farm, on Scot Lane (not to be confused <b>with</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> other Manor Farms in the locality) is thought to date from 1495 and, as such, is probably the oldest building in the village. Presently (2007) occupied by Mr and Mrs Slater; the building has recently (2002) undergone a sympathetic extension to incorporate an old semi-derelict barn onto the main house for use as a garage and workshop. Mr Slater, a Chartered Engineer, is interested in bringing the art of clock making back to the village. Rookery Farmhouse, in Breach Hill Lane, is dated at 1720, with later 18th century additions to either side of the central rear wing.|$|E
5|$|From 31 October to 15 November, the Wehrmacht {{high command}} stood down while {{preparing}} {{to launch a}} second offensive towards Moscow. Although Army Group Centre still possessed considerable nominal strength, its fighting capabilities had thoroughly diminished because of combat fatigue. While the Germans {{were aware of the}} continuous influx of Soviet reinforcements from the east as well as the presence of large reserves, given the tremendous Soviet casualties, they did not expect the Soviets to be able to mount a determined defense. But in comparison to the situation in October, Soviet rifle divisions occupied a much stronger defensive position: a triple defensive ring surrounding the city and some remnants of the Mozhaisk line near Klin. Most of the Soviet field armies now had a multilayered defense, <b>with</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> rifle divisions in second echelon positions. Artillery support and sapper teams were also concentrated along major roads that German troops were expected to use in their attacks. There were also many Soviet troops still available in reserve armies behind the front. Finally, Soviet troopsâand especially officersâwere now more experienced and better prepared for the offensive.|$|E

5|$|The StarCraft {{series is}} {{supported}} by eight novelizations, <b>with</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> more in the works, all published by Simon & Schuster. At BlizzCon 2007, Chris Metzen stated that he hoped to novelize the entirety of StarCraft and Brood War into a definitive text-based story. The first novel, StarCraft: Uprising, was written by Micky Neilson, a Blizzard Entertainment employee, and originally released only as an e-book in December 2000. The novel follows {{the origins of the}} character Sarah Kerrigan. The second novel, entitled StarCraft: Liberty's Crusade, serves as an adaptation of the first campaign of StarCraft, following on a journalist following a number of the key Terran characters in the series. Written by Jeff Grubb and published in March 2001, it was the first StarCraft novel to be released in paperback. StarCraft: Shadow of the Xel'Naga, published in July 2001 is the third novel, written by Kevin Anderson under the pseudonym Gabriel Mesta. It serves as a link between StarCraft and Brood War. The fantasy author Tracy Hickman was brought in to write the fourth novel, StarCraft: Speed of Darkness, which was published in June 2002. Speed of Darkness is written from the viewpoint of a Confederate marine during the early stages of StarCraft. The first four novels, including the e-book Uprising, were later re-released as a single anthology entitled The StarCraft Archive in November 2007.|$|E
5|$|At Federation in 1901 South Australia's defences {{became a}} federal responsibility. Though both {{infantry}} and artillery units were housed {{at the site}} on occasion, by 1903 {{there was no longer}} a permanent military presence at the fort. For most of the 20th century the site was neglected and largely vacated. It did attract some usage though not always of a military nature. During World War I it was partly revived for a former use, with ammunition stored on site. During the same period however the military used it as a detention barracks. Some or all of the fort was leased for private accommodation during the great depression. During the 1930s the magazine was again used, this time to store small arms ammunition. From June 1931 until the beginning of World War II the site housed a Sea Scout detachment, and was used as a district camp-site for the Boy Scouts. The Department of Defence decided in 1937 that much of the equipment and fittings at the fort were surplus to requirements. Consequent to this the mountings and carriages for the 10inch guns were removed and sold as scrap; though effort was made to scrap the barrels it proved uneconomic and they were left in place. In an unusual turn of events, the fort briefly housed refugees. Twenty-nine islanders from the Maldives were rescued from their sinking dhow by a ship bound for Wallaroo. They stayed at the fort for a week in 1938, before repatriation could be arranged. During World War II the fort again attracted military related use. During 1944 the Proof and Experimental Establishment at Port Wakefield made use of the site to proof ordnance QF 6 pounder anti-tank guns manufactured at General Motors Holden in Woodville. The fort was also used as a residence again, <b>with</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> families reported as living in the under-ground sections during the war.|$|E
