2500|$|There {{are several}} methods for forming {{internal}} cavities in extrusions. One {{way is to}} use a hollow billet and then use a fixed or floating mandrel. A fixed mandrel, also known as a German type, means it is integrated into the dummy block and stem. A floating mandrel, also known as a French type, floats in slots in the dummy block and aligns itself in the die when extruding. If a solid billet is used as the feed material then it must first be pierced by the mandrel before extruding through the die. A special press is used in order to control the mandrel independently from the ram. The solid billet could also be used with a spider die, porthole die or bridge die.

40|$|Abstract. Application of {{tailor welded blanks}} (TWBs) in {{automobile}} industry and aircraft manufacturing have been increased during past few years. Efficient material distribution and decreasing weight of the final part {{are some of the}} most important advantages of TWBs. Since tailor welded blanks are produced with at least two dissimilar and uniform or non-uniform thickness materials, they show different behavior than uniform materials during deep drawing process. In this research, the effect of <b>weld</b> <b>line</b> orientation on formability in deep drawing of tailor-welded blanks is examined using finite element simulation and experiments. The thinning behavior of the circular TWBs during a deep drawing in a square die is studied for different <b>weld</b> <b>line</b> orientations between two mild-steel blanks with different thicknesses. The numerical and experimental results indicate that the orientation of the <b>weld</b> <b>line</b> direction of the blank sheet has significant influence on the deformation behaviour. It is seen that thinning behavior is similar for two sections of TWB for the same <b>weld</b> <b>line</b> orientation. In addition, the most thinning occurs at 45 degree rotation of <b>weld</b> <b>line,</b> thus appropriate <b>weld</b> <b>line</b> orientation or the tailor blank sheets direction orientation can improve the formability of the tailor-welded blank in a deep-drawing of square cup...|$|R
5000|$|This {{process is}} the same as a regular {{extrusion}} process up until the die. There are three main types of dies used in this process: annular (or crosshead), spider, and spiral. Annular dies are the simplest, and rely on the polymer melt channeling around the entire cross section of the die before exiting the die; this can result in uneven flow. Spider dies consist of a central mandrel attached to the outer die ring via a number of [...] "legs"; while flow is more symmetrical than in annular dies, a number of <b>weld</b> <b>lines</b> are produced which weaken the film. Spiral dies remove the issue of <b>weld</b> <b>lines</b> and asymmetrical flow, but are by far the most complex.|$|E

40|$|Tailor welded blanks (TWBs) offer several notable {{benefits}} including decreased part weight, reduced manufacturing costs, {{and improved}} dimensional consistency.

5000|$|A spiral die is {{the most}} complex {{of the three major}} blown film die types. The polymer melt is evenly {{distributed}} into several feed tubes, which wind around a central mandrel. Each of these feed tubes is connected to the space between the mandrel and outer die walls; the feed tubes gradually diminish in diameter as they spiral around the mandrel. At the same time, the space between the mandrel and outer die walls is increased. This allows the polymer melt to layer and blend, resulting in a uniform melt profile free of <b>weld</b> <b>lines.</b> This die design produces the most uniform films, but is also the most expensive. Air pressure is introduced through the extrusion die so that after the polymer melt leaves the lip of the die, it expands in circumference. The tubing is also drawn along its length faster than it is being extruded. This leads to thinning of the film as it is expanded in both the draw (or machine) direction, and in the transverse (or hoop) direction. The ratio of the blown diameter to the extruded diameter is known as the blow-up ratio, and affects the resulting physical properties of the film, such as stiffness and strength. Film thickness and blow-up ratio can be varied by altering the take-up rate of the rollers, the internal pressure in the blown tube, and the melt extrusion rate.|$|E
