5|$|Kohli was India's leading run-getter in the five-match ODI {{series of}} the South African tour in January 2011, with 193 runs {{at an average of}} 48.25 {{including}} two fifties, both in Indian defeats. During the series, he jumped to number two spot on the ICC Rankings for ODI batsmen, and was named in India's 15-man squad for the World Cup. The inclusion of both Kohli and Raina in the World Cup squad resulted in speculations about which of the two batsmen <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> to the playing eleven. Days before India's first match of the tournament, Indian captain Dhoni indicated that the in-form Kohli is likely to be preferred over Raina.|$|E

5|$|Much of Raël's {{advocacy}} concerning futuristic {{technology is}} described in his 2001 book, Yes to Human Cloning. He supported human genetic engineering {{in order to avoid}} genetically inherited diseases and to reduce the economic burden on society. He said that no distinctive emphasis needed to be allocated to a particular race or religion. Elsewhere in the book, he stated that nanotechnology <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> possible to have micro-distributive power generation (essentially a power plant in each house), fur-like furnishings that are self-cleaning with hair-like fibers that move on their own, and biological robots. Nanostructures control biology, so Raël expected that meat and salads will someday be grown in a machine via molecular construction.|$|E

5|$|The {{catchment}} {{population for}} major food retail outlets in Dorchester is 38,500 (2001 estimate) and extends eight miles west, {{north and east}} of the town, and two miles south.

The second phase has attracted funding of £4 million from West Dorset District Council and includes new Marks & Spencer and Waitrose stores.|$|E
5|$|In November 2010, the Accident Investigation Board Norway {{criticized the}} braking system of the trains. During 2009, there were 83 {{incidents}} where trains with locked wheels slid down steep sections of track. The Accident Investigation Board found that the metro had conducted insufficient testing of {{the braking system}} on steep slippery lines, had not adjusted the brakes satisfactorily, and had not maintained the trains and tracks sufficiently. In December 2010, Oslo Vognselskap ordered another 32 three-car units, bringing the total order up to 115 three-car units. The last trains will be delivered in 2012. There was political disagreement regarding the final purchase, with the Liberal Party and socialist opposition securing a majority for the purchase, while the right-winged parties voted to order 19 units. The extra trains <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> possible to run all lines except the Holmenkollen Line (Line 1) with six-car lines, compared to a situation with only three-car trains on the Lambertseter Line, the Ring Line and the Kolsås Line (lines 4 and 6) would only use three-car trains.|$|E
