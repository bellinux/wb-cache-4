5000|$|To AwardsDaily, Robert said [...] "We {{wanted to}} write {{something}} for character Kristoff… In the beginning {{we knew that the}} songs <b>we</b> <b>wrote</b> for the external characters, the secondary characters, were the ones that seemed to be staying.

And <b>we</b> wanted to <b>write</b> something for Jonathan Groff. We always assumed we’d write a little bit more. But his character kept denying real songs". Kristen added [...] "In the deluxe version of the soundtrack…there’s something called the “Reindeer Remix,” which was a remix of “Reindeers Are Better Than People.” An expanded version that <b>we</b> <b>wrote,</b> half as a joke, and half as…“Wouldn’t it be fun to put this in the credits?

But she swore {{to them by}} the name of the living and eternal God: 'Whenever I see you or your names or your forms in an amulet, I will have no power over that infant.' She also agreed to have one hundred of her {{children}} die every day. Accordingly, every day one hundred demons perish, and for the same reason, <b>we</b> <b>write</b> the angels' names on the amulets of young children. When Lilith sees their names, she remembers her oath, and the child recovers.|$|E
25|$|Any poset (B,≤) {{such that}} every pair x,y of {{elements}} has both a sup and an inf {{is called a}} lattice. <b>We</b> <b>write</b> x∨y for the sup and x∧y for the inf. The underlying poset of a Boolean algebra always forms a lattice. The lattice {{is said to be}} distributive when x∧(y∨z)= (x∧y)∨(x∧z), or equivalently when x∨(y∧z)= (x∨y)∧(x∨z), since either law implies the other in a lattice. These are laws of Boolean algebra whence the underlying poset of a Boolean algebra forms a distributive lattice.|$|E
25|$|There {{are quite}} a few guitar solos on this album. To be honest, I've never really classed myself as a lead player as such, {{but this is the first}} time I've sat down and seriously practiced lead work. I've been so {{involved}} in actually writing new material and coming up with song structures that I haven't had time to practice all the frilly things that go on top of it. Up 'till now, there hasn't really been much room for guitar solos as such. The riffs <b>we</b> <b>write,</b> they're not riffs that are meant to be soloed on top of. They're melodic within themselves. But I'm a great believer that less is definitely more. I love listening to all the shreddy, widdly stuff, but I have no interest in playing it. This new album is quite guitar-orientated. The last album was, but this is definitely more melodic. Dare I say it, there {{are quite a}} lot of typical Maiden-esque harmonies in there.|$|E

25|$|One major {{application}} of the matrix theory is calculation of determinants, a central concept in linear algebra. While determinants could be defined in a basis-free manner, they are usually introduced via a specific representation of the mapping; {{the value of the}} determinant does not depend on the specific basis. It turns out that a mapping has an inverse if and only if the determinant has an inverse (every non-zero real or complex number has an inverse). If the determinant is zero, then the nullspace is nontrivial. Determinants have other applications, including a systematic way of seeing if a set of vectors is linearly independent (<b>we</b> <b>write</b> the vectors as the columns of a matrix, and if the determinant of that matrix is zero, the vectors are linearly dependent). Determinants could also be used to solve systems of linear equations (see Cramer's rule), but in real applications, Gaussian elimination is a faster method.|$|E

500|$|The theory {{requires}} the relation v = HD to hold at all times, where D is the comoving distance, v is the recessional velocity, and v, H, and D vary {{as the universe}} expands (hence <b>we</b> <b>write</b> H0 to denote the present-day Hubble [...] "constant"). For distances {{much smaller than the}} size of the observable universe, the Hubble redshift {{can be thought of as}} the Doppler shift corresponding to the recession velocity v. However, the redshift is not a true Doppler shift, but rather the result of the expansion of the universe between the time the light was emitted and the time that it was detected.|$|E

Ranaldo stated that [...] "these songs were allowed to breathe because they weren't sent through the fan machine.

He welcomed the additional 24minutes of screen time, and commented: [...] "We're always desperately cutting down our episodes.
