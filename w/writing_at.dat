5|$|After leaving school, Smith studied {{drama and}} {{creative}} <b>writing</b> <b>at</b> the University of East Anglia, graduating in 2005. His first theatre roles {{as part of}} the National Youth Theatre were Thomas Becket in Murder in the Cathedral and Bassoon in The Master and Margarita. His role in the latter earned him an agent and his first professional jobs, Fresh Kills and On the Shore of the Wide World. His new professional roles led him to seek an agreement with his university so that he could graduate without attending lectures in his final year.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{continuing}} popularity of Jerome's Chronicon and Orosius' Historia, the medieval writers who wrote about Philip called him the first Christian emperor. The Chronica Gallica of 452, Prosper of Aquitaine (d. ca. 455), Cassiodorus (d. ca. 585), Jordanes (fl. 551), Isidore of Seville (d. 636), and Bede (d. 735) all follow Jerome on this point. One early medieval historian <b>writing</b> <b>at</b> {{the eve of the}} millennium, the Lombard Landolfus Sagax, held that Philip had confessed to Fabian, Bishop of Rome, instead of Babylas.|$|E

She said the job was embarrassing, because {{she wanted to be a}} writer, as opposed to fact-checking the work of others.|$|E

5|$|Anderson {{initially}} {{intended it}} to be a stand-alone short film, but shortly before filming commenced, he realized that Schwartzman's character bore a close resemblance to one of the protagonists of a feature film he was <b>writing</b> <b>at</b> the time. That film would begin production a year later as The Darjeeling Limited. Chevalier takes place two weeks before Schwartzman's character (named Jack Whitman in the feature) joins his two older brothers on a journey in India in Darjeeling. The dialogue between the characters at the end of Chevalier is recounted by Schwartzman's character to his brothers {{at the close of the}} feature film, in the form of an excerpt from a short story he has composed. Portman's character has a brief cameo in the feature. Fox Searchlight Pictures, the studio that backed Darjeeling, was unaware of the short until the feature had been made and claimed to have no financial interest in it.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of his <b>writing,</b> <b>at</b> {{the time of his death}} Wallace had been for many years a {{well-known}} figure both as a scientist and as a social activist. He was often sought out by journalists and others for his views on a variety of topics. He received honorary doctorates and a number of professional honours, such the Royal Society's Royal Medal and Darwin Medal in 1868 and 1890 respectively, and the Order of Merit in 1908. Above all, his role as the co-discoverer of natural selection and his work on zoogeography marked him out as an exceptional figure.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in October 1962, Plath {{experienced}} a great burst {{of creativity and}} wrote most of the poems on which her reputation now rests, <b>writing</b> <b>at</b> least 26 of the poems of her posthumous collection Ariel during the final months of her life. In December 1962, she returned alone to London with their children, and rented, on a five-year lease, a flat at 23 Fitzroy Road—only a few streets from the Chalcot Square flat. William Butler Yeats once lived in the house, which bears an English Heritage blue plaque for the Irish poet. Plath was pleased by this fact and considered it a good omen.|$|E

5|$|In 1948 Kathleen married Frank Cole, a World War II veteran, {{and moved}} the family to Virginia. Godwin was further {{inspired}} by her mother's determination to continue writing after having a second child. According to Godwin, {{much of her time}} growing up was spent in the newsroom, where her mother worked. She also witnessed her mother's plays and novels being rejected. Godwin's autobiography creates the impression that much of her own writing was intended to accomplish the things her mother could not. As Cole's salary increased {{and he was able to}} support the family, Godwin's mother focused on being a wife and homemaker, eventually not <b>writing</b> <b>at</b> all.|$|E

She was subsequently a writer-in-residence at Our Lady of the Lake University in San Antonio, Texas. Cisneros has also worked as a college recruiter and an arts administrator.|$|E
