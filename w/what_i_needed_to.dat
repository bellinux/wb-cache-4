500|$|In October 2014, Stefani {{released}} her first solo single in six years, [...] "Baby Don't Lie", and following its moderate impact and reception, a new single, [...] "Spark the Fire", {{was released in}} December of the same year. However, both singles underperformed on the charts, prompting the album to be postponed for a 2015 release. After months with no updates on the album, Stefani revealed in an interview for Entertainment Weekly that she scrapped the entire album in favor of starting over, since she did not feel fulfilled and totally involved with the previous project. Stefani started writing new material in June 2015, and following her divorce from Gavin Rossdale a month later, she felt very inspired. In the same interview, Stefani claimed: [...] "I needed to go through <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> go through to write the record that I needed to write. [...] These songs are really natural — they’re from not worrying about what happened or what’s going to happen but about living in the moment, from trying to be present and trying to feel." ...|$|E

After hearing a demo version of the track, she begged Iglesias to let her record the song, telling {{him that it was}} [...] "her song". Lopez, who was going through a divorce with Marc Anthony and the [...] "breakup of a family", felt as if the song had come to her at the [...] "perfect moment". According to Lopez, the period was devastating because family is very important to her. Lopez revealed: [...] "I had to turn that into something better"; she thought: [...] "I don't want to just survive it, I want to come out better than that." [...] Lopez didn't want to be [...] "the woman who stayed in bed for months". [...] "I knew I had to get through it. I'd dance every day, I'd work out, I'd say a little prayer and I still wouldn't feel any better. Then I'd go to bed and get up the next day and do it all again. It was a process, and it very gradually got a little easier ... I had to do it for my kids. I had to get through it for them." [...] She re-wrote parts of the verses to better relate to her experiences. The song [...] "helped lift her out of the darkness" [...] and gave her hope again. Looking back on the song in December 2012, Lopez stated that: [...] "'Dance Again' became my anthem ... an expression of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> do at that time in my life and for what I was taking on with [...] It was a beautiful metaphor that became my reality." ...|$|E

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Oral {{endocrine}} therapy (OET) {{is standard}} therapy {{for millions of}} estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer survivors (ER+BCS). OET reduces recurrence, mortality, and metastasis. ER+BCS often do not take their OET as recommended due to adverse side effects. The purpose of this dissertation was to develop an explanatory framework of decision making by women with ER+ breast cancer who report experiencing side effects from OET. This project was comprised of two components. The first component was a systematic review with three main findings: (1) side effects negatively impact OET non-adherence, (2) there is an absence of decisional supports provided to or available for ER+BCS who are experiencing OET side effects,, and (3) ER+BCS likely have unmet decisional <b>needs</b> related <b>to</b> OET. The second component was a grounded theory study that included 31 ER+BCS reporting OET side effects. During a single semi-structured interview, participants described the experience of OET over time. This study produced two qualitatively derived projects. First, a theoretical framework was developed that depicted four stages through which the experience of OET decision making unfolded. The stages were (1) being told <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> do to live, (2) doing <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> do to live, (3) enduring <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> do to live, and (4) deciding how I want to live. Second, a typology was developed that depicted six sources of external decisional supports (healthcare providers, husbands, other breast cancer survivors, friends and family, the internet and other media sources, and God) that met four types of decisional needs (information about OET and its side effects, in-depth discussions about side effects, help in managing side effects, and emotional support). Findings {{can be used to}} develop interventions, such as decision aids, to promote quality decision making in women experiencing OET side effects. 1 yea...|$|R
