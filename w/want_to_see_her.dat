500|$|Charlie later {{struggles to}} deal with Ruby's {{relationship}} with Casey Braxton (Lincoln Younes). Discussing Charlie's motives, Anderson stated: [...] "Ruby's at that age where she is quite impressionable, and Charlie doesn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> getting hurt. She's only very recently been {{in a relationship with}} Romeo Smith (Luke Mitchell), and Charlie is concerned about her moving from one guy to the next too quickly." [...] Anderson opined it is Darryl Braxton (Steve Peacocke) who gives Charlie her first piece of good parenting advice. She concluded that Charlie's approach only causes conflict with Ruby because she is so strong-willed.|$|E

500|$|Tali's unmasked {{face and}} its {{potential}} appearance {{have been subject to}} discussion by both critics and fans. Casey Hudson, in an interview, acknowledged depictions of Tali's face as the most common fan art. Jordan Boughman, writing for GamesRadar, highlighted a piece of fan art that he enjoyed and which a BioWare developer had retweeted. Before the face was revealed, IGN's Scott Nichols ran an article about the possibility of revealing the face, concluding that fans did not just <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> face but also [...] "the expressions it can make, adding yet another level of emotional depth and complexity to a fan favorite character". GamesRadar's Mikel Reparaz listed it as one of the 12 gaming mysteries he wanted solved in 2011, and hoped that it would be something unusual-looking; this sentiment was echoed by fellow GamesRadar writer Tyler Nagata, who felt that the face should be ugly. PC Gamer's Tom Francis also included the face in their list of 15 things he wanted to see in Mass Effect 3.|$|E
500|$|Regarding the feud between Mercedes and Mitzeee, All About Soap {{columnist}} Laura Morgan {{commented that}} it was shocking that she felt sorry for Mercedes. She explained that even though Mercedes was [...] "a nasty cow" [...] because of the feud she was a [...] "woman teetering {{on the verge of}} a massive meltdown". Upon Mercedes telling Riley she has no need to be angry with Silas not sitting trial Morgan said she could tell Mercedes had been [...] "knocked her for six", adding that Mercedes could not [...] "hide anything from us". The journalist added that [...] "Mercedes did what Mercedes does best and decided a randy hook-up [...] was just what she needed to get her mind off Silas. After slapping on the war paint and selecting her sluttiest outfit, minxy Merc headed to a grotty hotel". She went on to explain that [...] "Mercedes knows she’s sinking. She pretty much admitted it when the doc asked her if she hated him and she replied, “I guess I hate myself a little more...” So why doesn’t she get some help before she totally and utterly loses the plot? [...] we’re missing our tart-with-a-heart Mercedes. We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> flirting her way around the village again, but without her finger firmly on the self-destruct button..." ...|$|E
500|$|Kristen Bell was lauded for her {{performance}} as Anna in the film. Michelle Im, {{writing for the}} Eye of the Tiger referred to the character as [...] "bubbly and spirited", and commented, [...] "Not only was [...] able to nail those vibratos and belting notes in her songs, it was actually her singing them." [...] The Coast News review of the film wrote that Bell [...] "earns top marks" [...] for instilling a spirited sensibility in the clumsy but well-meaning Anna. Cinenerd, a film critic for Blogcritics, commended the actress' singing ability, stating that she and Menzel [...] "sing their hearts out, with two showstoppers in Let it Go and For the First Time in Forever". Colin Covert of Colorado Springs' The Gazette considered Bell's performance as a [...] "flawless delivery". Matt Goldberg extolled the relationship between Anna and her elder sister Elsa, writing, [...] "There's so much to love about Frozen, but {{at the top of}} the list is the emphasis on [...] and Elsa's relationship. Anna still has an infatuation with the charming Hans and romantic chemistry with the flustered Kristoff, but her greatest love is for her sister. [...] is mostly scared and guilt-ridden. She's an incredibly sympathetic character, and it's a fresh spin on depicting estrangement between siblings. Anna has so much life and enthusiasm, and we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> share it with Elsa." [...] Magdalena Lachowicz of The Heights referred to this sisterly bond as [...] "what truly makes the film and the moral that comes with it", commenting, [...] "the plot is set up to lead the viewer into thinking that it needs to be true love's kiss—something which Anna then goes to seek. This journey sends her on a difficult adventure in which she learns about both sacrifice and love." [...] Debbie Lynn Elias of Culver City Observer commented, [...] "Female driven with confidence and positivity, Elsa and Anna are like two sides of a coin, both strong, albeit one through power and confidence and the other through clumsy sticktuitiveness and love," [...] while Stephen Holden from The New York Times appreciated that instead of a romantic attachment, it was a sisterly love and devotion that drove the story, which departed greatly from traditional Disney formula. Noah Lee described Anna and Elsa's relationship as [...] "genuine", saying, [...] "watching those themes of family and love versus isolation and fear touched my heart in more ways than one." ...|$|E

Godfrey told friends and family that Robinson was sending her away for training. After hearing nothing further from her, Godfrey's parents filed a missing persons report. Police questioned Robinson, who denied any knowledge of her whereabouts. Several days later her parents received a typewritten letter, with Godfrey's signature at the bottom, thanking Robinson for his help and asserting that she was [...] "OK" [...] and did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> family.

2500|$|Collaterlie Sisters (alternative spelling: [...] "Collately Sisters") (Doon Mackichan) – {{business}} correspondent. As satire of the incomprehensible {{nature of}} business news to the layman, Sisters talks nonsensically about the world of business, padding out her reports with meaningless jargon ("Trading remained succulent {{for the rest of}} the day.") [...] She uses bewildering graphics, mainly when addressing the currency market, using such aids as the [...] "Currency Cat", the [...] "Currency Kidney", and the [...] "International Finance Arse". Sisters also employs odd syntaxes, reciting strangely arranged sentences in a semi-robotic deadpan fashion (often smirking at seemingly arbitrary points in the monologue) and frequently name-checking Chris in the middle of her reports. During her reports, a news ticker scrolls across the bottom, displaying meaningless symbols, on one occasion containing lots of fours. Chris appears to have a strong dislike for Sisters as he can sometimes be heard making scathing remarks about her. In one episode, Chris asks someone to take Sisters off his monitor as [...] "I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> face".|$|E

The next day, following a conversation with Shabnam Masood (Rakhee Thakrar), Kat changes her mind and throws the letter away but Mo retrieves it and posts it on her behalf. After Kat is robbed, Stacey discovers that Kat has been overdosing on Tommy's medicine. Kat admits to drinking the medicine to numb out her thoughts about Harry, but promises to stop. When Stacey tells Mo that the money would not be good for Kat, Mo has a change of heart and has Harry's money transferred to her own account. Kat later finds out about this, and then, after burning the money, falls into a depression and tries to kill herself. Alfie finds her and calls an ambulance, at the hospital he admits that he is still in love with her. He takes her home and decides to stay temporarily in order to help her with the children and her upcoming visit from another social worker. During the visit, Kat remains withdrawn from answering questions about how she is feeling and why she attempted suicide and insists she is fine, but Alfie says on her behalf that she is not fine but that they are working on it, and admits to the social worker his feelings of guilt from starting the fire.|$|E
