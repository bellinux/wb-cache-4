5|$|It isn't a {{personal}} pain which has brought me here, {{as is the}} case in the majority of these people, but rather recognition of the symbolic nature of Katyń. Russians and Poles, tortured to death, lie here together. It seems very important to me that the truth should be spoken about <b>what</b> <b>took</b> <b>place,</b> for only with the truth can the new Soviet leadership distance itself from the crimes of Stalin and the NKVD. Only the truth can serve as the basis of true friendship between the Soviet and the Polish peoples. The truth will make a path for itself. I am convinced of this by the very fact that I was able to travel here.|$|E

Instead, they raided white settlements along the Saline and Solomon rivers. Some of the warriors returned to Black Kettle's camp.

25|$|Unlike the Hambledon {{players who}} tended to {{represent}} their club only, Stevens made appearances for just about every team, including Hambledon. He is normally associated with Surrey teams in general and with the famous Chertsey club in particular. He continued as a player until he was 50 and played his last match on 2–5 September 1789 for All-England v Hampshire at Sevenoaks Vine. It is not known <b>what</b> <b>took</b> <b>place</b> in his career following this game, but John Major suspected that Stevens enlisted in the British Army. On 20 May 1793 a letter signed by 'A Kentish Cricketer' written to Sporting Magazine describes an incident where an Ensign Hamilton, {{a member of the}} Sevenoaks Vine Club, had a cannonball deflected away from his head by a Sergeant. The magazine and the Maidstone Journal both linked the story to Stevens.|$|E

25|$|In the 1953 essay, Journey to The Crucible, Miller {{writes of}} visiting Salem and feeling {{like the only}} one {{interested}} in what really happened in 1692. However, {{a long line of}} historians before Miller had attempted to record and tease apart the complexities of <b>what</b> <b>took</b> <b>place</b> at Salem, and certain battle lines had long before been drawn: Calef vs. Mather; Upham vs. Poole, skeptics or scholars vs. the faithful and the religious establishment. Miller's cursory and limited scholarship regarding the trials is lamentable, given the squabbling that has long taken place over various interpretations of the numerous details and facts. Many of Miller's characters were based on people who had little in the public record other than their statements from the trials, but others survived to expand, recant, or comment on the role they played at Salem, including jurors, accusers, survivors, and judges. Rev. Parris issued his {{first in a series of}} apologies on November 26, 1694, and was removed from his position in 1697. In 1698, Hale finished composing a lengthy essay about Salem that was reprinted by Burr in 1914.|$|E

Middleton called Patton to come take a look, and Patton was joined by Bradley and Eisenhower. [...] In his diary, Patton described the place as [...] "one of the most appalling sights that I have ever seen." [...] This was the first Nazi concentration camp to be discovered by the United States Army, and Eisenhower cabled Marshall to get a delegation from congress over to witness and communicate <b>what</b> <b>took</b> <b>place</b> there.

500|$|Close-Up, for example, {{contains}} {{scenes from}} the real-life trial of a man charged with fraudulently impersonating a film director. To make the film, however, Kiarostami coaxed the antagonists to re-stage scenes occurring between them, including the arrest. While such a technique clearly precludes labeling the film as a documentary, by re-staging events between the deceiver and the deceived Kiarostami implicitly poses questions about the validity and significance of what the audience sees. Because these are the actual participants in a drama played out in criminal court, it dawns on the audience that these re-stagings {{are also part of}} the real life of these people, especially since both the impersonator and the family he fooled were interested in working in cinema. If these re-enactments constitute a kind of [...] "evidence", this is less because they show us <b>what</b> <b>took</b> <b>place</b> to cause the arrest than because the audience is witness to a scene in which the actors are in fact continuing the story of their confrontation and/or reconciliation.|$|E
500|$|There are {{no reports}} as to <b>what</b> <b>took</b> <b>place</b> between Ilić and Apis, {{but soon after}} their meeting, Apis's righthand man and fellow Black Hander, Serbian Major Vojislav Tankosić, who by this time {{was in charge of}} guerrilla training, called a Serbian irredentist {{planning}} meeting in Toulouse, France. Amongst those summoned to the Toulouse meeting was Muhamed Mehmedbašić, a carpenter by trade and son of an impoverished Muslim noble from Herzegovina. He too {{was a member of the}} Black Hand, having been sworn into the organization by Black Hand Provincial Director for Bosnia-Herzegovina Vladimir Gacinović and Danilo Ilić. Mehmedbašić was (here quoting Albertini paraphrasing Mehmedbašić) [...] "eager to carry out an act of terrorism to revive the revolutionary spirit of Bosnia." [...] During this January 1914 meeting, various possible Austro-Hungarian targets for assassination were discussed, including Franz Ferdinand. However, the participants decided only to dispatch Mehmed Mehmedbašić to Sarajevo, to kill the Governor of Bosnia, Oskar Potiorek.|$|E
500|$|In 1972, {{as part of}} a {{renovation}} of the Museum of the Chinese Revolution, officials wanted to exhibit Dong's painting again, but they decreed that Lin Boqu, whose white-haired figure was furthest left, must be removed. [...] This was because the Gang of Four, then in control of China, blamed Lin Boqu (who had died in 1960) for opposing the marriage, in the revolutionary days, of Mao with Jiang Qing (one of the Four). [...] Sources differ on <b>what</b> <b>took</b> <b>place</b> regarding the painting: Chang-Tai Hung related that Dong, terminally ill with cancer, could not make the changes, so his student Jin Shangyi and another artist, Zhao Yu, were assigned to do the work. [...] The two feared damaging the original canvas, so made an exact replica but for the required changes, with Dong brought forth from his hospital for consultations. [...] According to Andrews, Jin and Zhao created the new version because Dong would not let anyone else alter his painting. [...] Jin later stated that the painting, while effective politically, also shows Dong's inner world.|$|E
