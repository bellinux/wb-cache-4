Social Credit, under W.A.C. Bennett's son, Bill Bennett, was returned to office. Under the younger Bennett's government, 85% of the province's land base was transferred from Government Reserve to management by the Ministry of Forests, reporting of deputy ministers was centralized to the Premier's Office, and NDP-instigated social programs were rolled back, with then-Human Resources Minister infamously demonstrating a golden shovel to highlight his <b>welfare</b> <b>policy,</b> although the new-era Socreds also reinforced and backed certain others instigated by the NDP—notably {{the creation of the}} Resort Municipality of Whistler, whose special status including Sunday drinking, then an anomaly in BC.|$|E

The Yushin Regime : the Mobilisation of Private Resources ConclusionThis paper {{focuses on}} the nature of <b>welfare</b> <b>policies</b> of the Park regime in Korea within the context of developmentalism. Taking over the power by coup, President Park {{launched}} a wide range of policies to develop Korea. <b>Welfare</b> <b>policies</b> were also strongly influenced {{by the nature of the}} economic development plan and those two policy areas were interdependent with each other. The paper examines a variety of economic and <b>welfare</b> <b>policies</b> through which the government tried to mobilise private resources and participation of the people from a historical point of view. It argues that President Park 2 ̆ 7 s government successfully combined economic developmentalism with <b>welfare</b> <b>policies,</b> which resulted in the strong characteristics of public and private mix of <b>welfare</b> <b>policies</b> under the Park regime...|$|R
40|$|Variations {{in state}} <b>welfare</b> <b>policies</b> {{in the reform}} era may affect {{adolescents}} through two mechanisms: A competing labor market hypothesis posits that stringent state <b>welfare</b> <b>policies</b> may reduce adolescent employment; and a signaling hypothesis posits that stringent <b>welfare</b> <b>policies</b> may promote enrollment. To test these hypotheses, we use a dynamic joint model of adolescents' school enrollment and formal employment, separating state <b>welfare</b> <b>policies</b> from non-welfare state policies, state labor market conditions, and unobserved state characteristics. Longitudinal data from the NLSY 97 on adolescents aged 14 to 18 and various state data sources over the period 1994 - 1999 support the competing labor market effect but not the signaling effect. In particular, lower-income dropouts suffer more severely from fewer labor market opportunities when state <b>welfare</b> <b>policies</b> are more stringent, which indicates that welfare reform may compromise work opportunities for lower-income dropouts. © 2004 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management. ...|$|R

2500|$|The Yes {{campaign}} {{has argued that}} control of <b>welfare</b> <b>policy</b> {{would be a major}} benefit of independence. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, independence would [...] "give the opportunity for more radical reform, so that the [...] system better reflects the views of the Scottish people". Yes Scotland and deputy first minister Nicola Sturgeon have said the existing welfare system can only be guaranteed by voting for independence. In September 2013, the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations (SCVO), which represents charities, called for a separate welfare system to be established in Scotland.|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, Rainer {{was himself}} an active proponent of [...] "hereditary determinism" [...] and eugenics, which he {{understood}} as the cornerstone of social <b>welfare</b> <b>policy.</b> As he put it: [...] "In the colorful mass of genes that carry those characteristics we inherit from our forerunners, one may find embedded [...] even our very destinies as men." [...] A committed physiognomist, he believed that [...] "only the phenotype may be influenced, to a certain extent, by our environment and our education." [...] In June 1929, the newspaper Adevărul published one of Rainer's critical essays on the 1923 land reform. In it, Rainer claimed that the system of land reallocation had proved ignorant of eugenic and biopolitical principles. Nevertheless, as readers of his work suggests, Rainer helped preserve a balance in anthropology by also looking into environmental factors, thus questioning the ideological supremacy of scientific racism.|$|E
