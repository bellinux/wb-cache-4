40|$|This paper {{presents}} the mechanism and robust {{control of a}} monolithic <b>wire</b> <b>clamp</b> to achieve fast and precision operations for strong and robust micro device packaging. The <b>wire</b> <b>clamp</b> is piezoelectrically actuated and a two-stage flexure-based amplification was designed to obtain large and parallel jaw displacements. The grasping forces of the <b>wire</b> <b>clamp</b> were evaluated based on finite element analysis (FEA), and the force measurement was presented. The <b>wire</b> <b>clamp</b> was manufactured using wire EDM technique and the position and force transfer functions were obtained based on the frequency response approach. The position/force switching control strategy was employed to regulate the motion position and grasping force, and the position/force switching controller composed of a PID controller for position control and a sliding model controller (SMC) for force control was designed. Experimental tests were carried out to investigate the performance of <b>wire</b> <b>clamp</b> with the position/force switching controller during the grasping and releasing operations. The {{results show that the}} <b>wire</b> <b>clamp</b> exhibits good performance and demonstrate that high speed and precision grasping operations can be realized through the developed <b>wire</b> <b>clamp</b> and the control strategy. ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Wire</b> <b>clamps</b> {{consist of}} a piece of heavy wire, {{typically}} steel, first bent into a tight U, then formed into a ring shape with one end overlapping the other, and finally the ends bent outwards and cut. A captive nut is attached to one end, and a captive screw to the other. When the screw is tightened, the overlapped ends of the wire are pushed apart, tightening the wire loop around the hose. For an explanation of why this design is used, see the section on sealing the connection.|$|R

The VW piezometer incorporates a vibrating wire pressure sensor enclosed inside a stainless steel housing. The VW sensing element is formed essentially of a steel <b>wire</b> <b>clamped</b> under tension between a sensitive diaphragm at one end and the rear body of the transducer at the other. An electromagnetic coil (in the sensor) is used to excite the wire to vibrate (ring) and then to measure the vibration frequency of the wire.

40|$|This thesis {{demonstrates}} {{the feasibility of}} methods developed to increase {{the quality of the}} crescent bond together with the tail bond quality. Low pull force of the crescent bond limits the usage of insulated Au wire in microelectronics assembly. Premature break of the tail which results in the stoppage of the bonding machine is one of obstacles to overcome for Cu wire. The primary focus of this thesis is to understand the tail and crescent bonding process and then to propose methodologies to improve thermosonic wire bonding processes when Cu and insulated Au wires are used. Several series of experiments to investigate the crescent and tail bonding processes are performed on auto bonders. Cu and insulated Au wires with diameters of 25 mm are bonded on the diepads of Ag leadframes. For simplicity, wire loops are oriented perpendicular to the ultrasonic direction. It was found that the crescent bond breaking force by pulling the wire loop (pull force) with insulated Au wire is about 80 % of that of bare Au wire. A modification of the crescent bonding process is made to increase the pull force with insulated Au wire. In the modified process, an insulation layer removing stage (cleaning stage) is inserted before the bonding stage. The cleaning stage consists of a scratching motion (shift) toward to the ball bond in combination with ultrasound. Bonds are then made on the fresh diepad with the insulation removed from the contact surface of the insulated Au wire. This process increases the pull force of the crescent bond up to 26 % which makes it comparable to the results obtained with bare Au wire. An online tail breaking force measurement method is developed with a proximity sensor between <b>wire</b> <b>clamp</b> and horn. Detailed understanding of tail bond formation is achieved by studying tail bond imprints with scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray analysis. Descriptions are given of the dependence of the tail breaking force on the bonding parameters, metallization variation, and cleanliness of the bond pad. Simultaneous optimization with pull force and tail breaking force can optimize the Cu wire bonding process both with high quality and robustness. It is recommended to first carry out conventional pull force optimization followed by a minimization of the bonding force parameter to the lowest value still fulfilling the pull force cpk requirement. The tail bond forms not only under the capillary chamfer, but also under the capillary hole. The tail breaking force includes both the interfacial bond breaking strength and the breaking strength of the thinned portion of the wire that will remain at the substrate as residue. Close investigations of the tail bond imprint with scanning electron microscopy indicate the presence of fractures of the substrate indicating substrate material being picked up by Cu wire tail. Pick up is found on Au and Cu wires, but the amount of pick up is much larger on Cu wire. The effect on the hardness of the subsequently formed Cu free air ball (FAB) as investigated with scanning electron microscopy and micro - hardness test shows that Cu FABs containing Au and Ag pick ups are softer than those without pick up. However, the hardness varies significantly more with Au pick up. The amount of Au pick up is estimated higher than 0. 03 % of the subsequently formed FAB volume, exceeding typical impurity and dopant concentrations (0. 01 %) added during manufacturing of the wire...|$|E

50|$|One of the {{fundamental}} goals of most hose clamps is to ensure a tight seal between the hose and the barb, preventing the working fluid from escaping. To this goal, {{they are designed to}} provide even pressure on all sides, with no gaps. An example of this would be <b>wire</b> <b>clamps.</b> An obvious design would seem to be simply having a wire around the hose, one end attached to a nut, and the other end to the screw, and when tightened, pulling the ends of the wire towards each other. However, this will leave a gap where no pressure is applied (underneath the screw), and cause a leak. To combat this, the more complicated and weaker design of having the ends overlap and then be pushed apart from each other is used, as this ensures pressure around the entire circumference of the hose.|$|R

The saddle is then fitted over the ropes on to the bolt (the saddle includes two holes to fit to the u-bolt). The nuts secure the arrangement in place. Three or more clamps are usually used to terminate a wire rope. As many as eight may be needed for a 2 in diameter rope.|$|R

40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} that the clamped-wire system used to suspend bones within an Ilizarov external fixator yields when the perpendicular load exceeds 50 N per wire. Cyclic loading was applied to tensioned <b>wires</b> <b>clamped</b> within an Ilizarov ring component, with steadily increasing load amplitude. Wires were tested at four initial tension settings. The amount of energy lost within the clamped-wire system per load cycle was calculated for every test. The results showed {{that there was a}} consistent trend to increasing non-recoverable energy loss per load cycle when peak loads exceed 50 N for all initial tension settings. A finite element (FE) model replicating the experimental conditions was performed to investigate the levels of stress within the loaded wires. The FE model analyses showed that high stresses were generated in the wires close to the clamping sites, and that the stress levels could reasonably be expected to exceed the material yield stress when loaded to about 55 N, for all initial tension settings. The results show that material yield, accompanied by some wire slippage through the clamps, is responsible for system yield, in agreement with previous studies. Although the initial wire tension has an appreciable effect on the wire stiffness, it did not affect the elastic load range of the clamped-wire system. To prevent yield of the clamped-wire system in practice, the fixator should be assembled with sufficient wires to ensure that the load transmitted to each wire by the patient does not exceed 50 N...|$|R

The wires were pulled in a distal direction in order to simulate the initial stage of alignment and leveling, when the archwires must slide through the brackets.

5000|$|This {{technique}} is favored over single-microelectrode clamp or other voltage clamp techniques when conditions call for resolving large currents. The high current-passing {{capacity of the}} two-electrode clamp {{makes it possible to}} clamp large currents that are impossible to control with single-electrode patch techniques. The two-electrode system is also desirable for its fast clamp settling time and low noise. However, TEVC is limited in use with regard to cell size. It is effective in larger-diameter oocytes, but more difficult to use with small cells. Additionally, TEVC method is limited in that the transmitter of current must be contained in the pipette. It is not possible to manipulate the intracellular fluid while clamping, which is possible using patch clamp techniques. Another disadvantage involves [...] "space clamp" [...] issues. Cole's voltage clamp used a long <b>wire</b> that <b>clamped</b> the squid axon uniformly along its entire length.

5000|$|When {{used in a}} {{switching}} transformer, one winding of the bifilar coil {{is used as a}} {{means of}} removing the energy stored in the stray magnetic flux which fails to link the primary coil to the secondary coil of the transformer.

If this clamping coil was not used, the stray magnetic flux would attempt to force a current to flow through the primary wire. Since the primary wire is switched off and the switching transistor is in a high resistance state, the high voltage which would appear on the semiconductor switching transistor would exceed its electrical breakdown or even damage it.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the {{suitability}} of alkali treatment followed by heat treatment at 600 °C, and spark oxidation for nickel–titanium, intended for medical applications such as pins, <b>wires</b> and <b>clamps,</b> was evaluated {{on the basis of}} nanomechanical and wear testing. In addition, the chemical composition and topography of the surface layer, wetting ability, corrosion resistance and influence of the heat treatment on structure of the alloy were also investigated. The results showed that the highest hardness was observed for alkali-treated samples, and this could be correlated with the structure of the sample that contained martensite and a higher phase transformation temperature. This treatment caused a very large increase of nickel in the top layer and decreased resistance in pitting corrosion. These results disqualified the treatment to be considered as useful for medical applications. On the other hand, the hardness of the oxidized samples was at the same level as that obtained for ground reference samples. Moreover, the oxide layer was enriched with phosphorus, and it was predominantly composed of TiO 2 and phosphorus oxides.

40|$|Inactivation of delayed {{rectifier}} K conductance (gK) was {{studied in}} squid giant axons {{and in the}} somata of giant fiber lobe (GFL) neurons. Axon measurements were made with an axial <b>wire</b> voltage <b>clamp</b> by pulsing to VK (∼− 10 mV in 50 – 70 mM external K) for a variable time and then assaying available gK with a strong, brief test pulse. GFL cells were studied with whole-cell patch clamp using the same prepulse procedure {{as well as with}} long depolarizations. Under our experimental conditions (12 – 18 °C, 4 mM internal MgATP) a large fraction of gK inactivates within 250 ms at − 10 mV in both cell bodies and axons, although inactivation tends to be more complete in cell bodies. Inactivation in both preparations shows two kinetic components. The faster component is more temperature-sensitive and becomes very prominent above 12 °C. Contribution of the fast component to inactivation shows a similar voltage dependence to that of gK, suggesting a strong coupling of this inactivation path to the open state. Omission of internal MgATP or application of internal protease reduces the amount of fast inactivation. High external K decreases the amount of rapidly inactivating IK but does not greatly alter inactivation kinetics. Neither external nor internal tetraethylammonium has a marked effect on inactivation kinetics. Squid delayed rectifier K channels in GFL cell bodies and giant axons thus share complex fast inactivation properties that do not closely resemble those associated with either C-type or N-type inactivation of cloned Kv 1 channels studied in heterologous expression systems...|$|R
40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} that <b>clamping</b> a tensioned <b>wire</b> {{can cause a}} reduction in wire tension. Tension (about 1275 N) was applied to a wire that was subsequently clamped, using cannulated bolts, to the steel half-ring of an Ilizarov external fixator. The tension in the wire was monitored before, during and after clamping. The apparatus was disassembled and the deformations in the wire caused by the clamps were measured. This experiment was repeated 15 times. When the <b>wire</b> was <b>clamped</b> to the frame, the wire tension was reduced by 22 +/- 7 per cent (mean +/- standard deviation, SD). The drop in wire tension was linearly correlated (r = 0. 96; p < 0. 001) with the deformation caused by the bolts. A finite element (FE) model of the wire was also constructed. The model was pre-stressed (tensioned), and the clamping effect replicated. This analysis showed that <b>clamping</b> the <b>wire</b> could be considered to squeeze the wire outwards (like toothpaste from a tube) and so reduce its tension during fixator assembly. To assess {{the magnitude of this}} effect in the clinical situation, the FE model analysis was repeated to replicate clamping a 1. 8 -mm-diameter wire to a 180 -mm-diameter steel Ilizarov ring component. The analysis showed that for these conditions the tension reduced by 8 - 29 per cent. The results of this study highlight a general engineering problem: how can a tensioned wire be secured to a structure without an appreciable loss of tension? If the performance of the structure depends on the wire tension, this performance will change when the wire is secured...|$|R
40|$|The {{safety of}} {{suspension}} bridges {{depends on its}} main cables which are constructed of thousands of high strength steel <b>wires</b> radially <b>clamped</b> together at certain locations along the cable. After many years of service, these cables are showing signs of serious distress with many wires corroded and even broken inside. A new methodology to determine the reliability and safety of this structure is suggested in this research work. A three dimensional random field simulation is {{used to determine the}} remaining tensile strength in the cable. The key idea is to determine how an individual wire break affects the load transfer to the surrounding wires. This local damage eventually causes a global reduction in the load carrying capacity of the cable, up to a complete failure. A Monte Carlo technique is used to generate realizations of the wires' strength within a finite element model. Among the major contributions of the thesis is a novel technique for modeling the contact-friction mechanism between thousands of wires that account for load recovery in broken wires due to friction induced by radial clamps. The idea is to place elasto-plastic springs at the contact points between wires. These springs have varying parameters depending on their proximity to the clamping loads and are assigned according to the Boussinesq's solution to a point load in half space. While traditional contact algorithms have difficulties converging on this problem, this technique converges in few iterations. Moreover, parallelization of the problem enables a full stochastic analysis to determine the effect of corrosion uncertainty on the cable's failure load. This method represents a dramatic improvement compared to the current inspection methods that are unreliable and expensive...|$|R

Both {{procedures are}} based on frequency domain scattering-parameter measurements, and refer to a <b>clamped</b> <b>wiring</b> composed of a single-ended interconnection. One procedure exploits a black-box approach, requires a calibration fixture, and is suited for practical implementation. The other is based on circuit interpretation of coupling and propagation effects, and is aimed at a theoretical analysis of injection.

The two procedures lead to probe circuit models topologically equivalent, with lumped-Pi structure, performing well in the frequency band of interest for BCI. In the derivation, it is shown that the probe input impedance is the central quantity for the characterization of the frequency-dependent properties of the ferrite core, and for the modeling of inductive coupling (dominant effect).

We tested the tendon grafts with five different types of fixation devices: surgical thread (Premicron 3), general mounting <b>clamp,</b> <b>wire</b> mesh, cement fixation, and a modified clamp for an INSTRON loading machine.
