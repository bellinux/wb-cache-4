5|$|I wish I could dissent {{from the}} general, though not universal, chorus of dispraise that has greeted this long-awaited and fairly long-delayed opera; but unless it has secrets to yield up – {{and one of}} the main reasons for feeling so dispirited as it went on <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> that one might be even more bored, if possible, during a {{subsequent}} hearing than during the first – the majority verdict is all too depressingly right.|$|E
25|$|Adding to the interracial {{animosity}} <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> of many whites {{that their}} former slaves had betrayed them. Before the war, slaveholders had convinced {{themselves that they}} were treating their slaves well and had earned their slaves' loyalty. When the Union Army rolled in and slaves deserted by the thousands, slaveholders were stunned. The black population scrambled to preserve its new rights while the white population attempted to claw its way back up the social ladder by denying blacks those same rights and reviving white supremacy.|$|E
500|$|This {{resolution}} {{had been}} the principal target of the Federalist attack on the Resolutions. Particularly at issue <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> in which the states were parties to the federal compact. The Report was ultimately amended to provide greater clarity on this issue by emphasizing that when the Virginians claimed that the [...] "states" [...] were parties to the federal Constitution, the referent of the word [...] "state" [...] was the sovereign people of the particular state. [...] Thus, to say that [...] "the state of Virginia ratified the Constitution" [...] was {{to say that the}} sovereign people of Virginia ratified the Constitution. The amended Report passed the House of Delegates on January 7 by a margin of 60 to 40. At some point in the next two weeks, it passed the Senate by a margin of 15 to 6.|$|E

500|$|In {{the moment}} of surrender, I let go of all the {{theological}} or social questions which had kept me from [...] for countless years. I simply let them go. There <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense,</b> profound and wordless, that if He knew everything I {{did not have to}} know everything, and that, in seeking to know everything, I'd been, all of my life, missing the entire point. No social paradox, no historic disaster, no hideous record of injustice or misery should keep me from Him. No question of Scriptural integrity, no torment over the fate of this or that atheist or gay friend, no worry for those condemned and ostracized by my church or any other church should stand between me and Him. The reason? It was magnificently simple: He knew how or why everything happened; He knew the disposition of every single soul. He wasn't going to let anything happen by accident! Nobody {{was going to go to}} Hell by mistake." ...|$|E
500|$|Hitoshi Sakimoto {{composed}} {{most of the}} game's soundtrack; Nobuo Uematsu, {{following his}} departure from Square Enix in 2004, only contributed the theme song, [...] "Kiss Me Good-Bye", sung by Angela Aki. Uematsu noted that Aki's style of playing the keyboard while singing {{reminded him of his}} childhood idol, Elton John, {{which was one of the}} reasons he chose her. Aki was approached for the role three years before the release of the game. She based her words for the song on [...] "a scene of a new journey after good-bye", which <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> she had gotten from Uematsu's melody, and was encouraged by Uematsu not to limit herself in her lyrics to what she thought the producers wanted. Sakimoto was brought in to compose the soundtrack to the game by Yasumi Matsuno, the producer of the game, five months before the game was officially announced. Sakimoto experienced difficulty following in Uematsu's footsteps, but he decided to create a unique soundtrack in his own way, although he cites Uematsu as his biggest musical influence.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} to promote {{the release of the}} novel, Gibson revealed that {{one of the issues that}} had most affected his writing process since Pattern Recognition <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> that everything in the text was potentially searchable online. [...] "It's as though there is a sort of invisible hyperlink theoretical text that extends out of the narrative of my novel in every direction", he commented. A recipient of an advanced reading copy initiated Node Magazine, a literary project in the guise of the novel's fictional magazine, with the intent of annotating the novel. The author, under the nom de plume patternBoy, mobilised a cadre of volunteers to track the references and collate the cloud of data surrounding the work – those elements of the story with footprints on internet resources such as Google and Wikipedia. The project had precedent in Joe Clark's , an attempt at logging and annotating Pattern Recognition, but whereas that took several years to develop, Node was complete before the novel was even published.|$|E

500|$|For Santopietro, Sinatra was the {{personification}} of America in the 1950s: [...] "cocky, eye on the main chance, optimistic, and full {{of the sense of}} possibility". Barbara Sinatra wrote that [...] "A big part of Frank's thrill <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> of danger that he exuded, an underlying, ever-present tension only those closest to him knew could be defused with humor". [...] Cary Grant, a good friend of Sinatra's, stated that Sinatra was the [...] "most honest person he'd ever met", who spoke [...] "a simple truth, without artifice which scared people", and was often moved to tears by his performances. [...] Jo-Caroll Dennison commented that he possessed [...] "great inner strength", and that his energy and drive was [...] "enormous". A workaholic, he reportedly only slept for four hours a night on average. Throughout his life, Sinatra had mood swings and bouts of mild to severe depression, admitting to an interviewer in the 1950s that [...] "I have an over-acute capacity for sadness as well as elation". Barbara Sinatra stated that he would [...] "snap at anyone for the slightest misdemeanor", while Van Heusen said that when Sinatra got drunk it was [...] "best to disappear".|$|E
2500|$|Verne's meticulous {{attention}} to detail and scientific trivia, coupled with his sense of wonder and exploration, form {{the backbone of the}} Voyages. Part of the reason for the broad appeal of his work <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> that the reader could really learn knowledge of geology, biology, astronomy, paleontology, oceanography and the exotic locations and cultures of world through the adventures of Verne's protagonists. This great wealth of information distinguished his works as [...] "encyclopedic novels".|$|E
2500|$|After Stalin, a Russified Georgian, became undisputed {{leader of}} the Soviet Union, the Russian {{language}} gained greater emphasis. In 1938, Russian became a required subject of study in every Soviet school, including those in which a non-Russian language was the principal medium of instruction for other subjects (e.g., mathematics, science, and social studies). [...] In 1939, non-Russian languages that had been given Latin-based scripts in the late 1920s were given new scripts based on the Cyrillic script. [...] One likely rationale for these decisions <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> of impending war and that Russian was the language of command in the Red Army.|$|E
40|$|Studying a {{language}} cannot {{be separated from}} studying the meaning of that language because when one is learning {{a language}} he/she <b>is</b> also learning <b>the</b> meaning of the language. The meaning of a language {{can be seen from}} its relation between words, i. e. <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> of one word <b>is</b> related to <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> of another. In this case there are two major groups of <b>sense</b> relations. <b>The</b> first group <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> relations with regard to the sameness as synonymy. <b>The</b> second one <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> relations of oppositeness as antonymy.

2500|$|Curtis's second-in-command. On {{taking the}} role, Bell said, [...] "The reason why I {{wanted to be}} a part of the film was because of what Director Bong had to say about it; it was his vision that he brought to the table and I thought what it stood for was {{important}} to me." [...] When asked of performances that were interpreted differently onscreen from the screenplay, writer Masterson stated, [...] " [...] is very impish and mischievous as Edgar, which I didn't predict from his character. That might just be Jamie." [...] and of his performance, [...] "I think 's performance, a lot of it is improvised, and quite brilliantly." [...] On relating to the character, Bell said, [...] "You know, I come from a very working-class background myself. There <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> that I had to overcome something and really test myself. So in a way Edgar is very similar, he genuinely doesn't have anything and he's the lowest of the low of these people." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the interval, Spofforth made an {{announcement}} to his team-mates in the dressing-room: [...] "This thing can be done.!" [...] In spite of being reduced to fifteen for two early on, England {{made a good}} start in its pursuit of a victory target of 85. The score rose to 51 for two, with Grace and Ulyett hitting out strongly. Spofforth changed ends, and Neville Cardus wrote thus of this move: [...] "Now I was behind his arm; I could see his superb break-back. And he bowled mainly medium pace at this time. With each off-break I could see his right hand, {{at the end of}} the swing over, finish near the left side, 'cutting' under the ball. Sometimes his arm went straight over and continued straight down in the follow-through – and then the batsmen had to tackle fierce topspin. There <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> of the inimical in his aspect now. He seemed taller than he was half an hour ago, the right arm more sinuous. There was no excitement in him he was ... cold-blooded." ...|$|E
2500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film {{three out of}} four stars and wrote, [...] "What I liked about Two-Lane Blacktop <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> of life that {{occasionally}} sneaked through, particularly in the character of G.T.O. (Warren Oates). He is the only character who is fully occupied with being himself (rather than the instrument of a metaphor), and so we get the sense we've met somebody". In his review for The New York Times, Vincent Canby wrote, [...] "Two-Lane Blacktop is a far from perfect film (those metaphors keep blocking the road), but it has been directed, acted, photographed and scored (underscored, happily) with the restraint and control of an aware, mature filmmaker". Time magazine's Jay Cocks wrote, [...] "The film is immaculately crafted, funny and quite beautiful, resonant with a lingering mood of loss and loneliness ... Not a single frame in the film is wasted. Even the small touches— the languid tension while refueling at a back-country gas station or the piercing sound of an ignition buzzer— have their own intricate worth". In his review for the Village Voice, J. Hoberman wrote, [...] "Two-Lane Blacktop is a movie of achingly eloquent landscapes and absurdly inert characters". In his review for the Chicago Reader, Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote, [...] "The movie starts off as a narrative, but gradually grows into something much more abstract— it's unsettling, but also beautiful".|$|E

2500|$|Most {{responses}} {{to her voice}} emphasise her breathy sensuality. Another powerful feature <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> of longing, in songs such as [...] "I Just Don't Know What to Do with Myself" [...] and [...] "Goin' Back". The uniqueness of Springfield's voice was described by Bacharach: [...] "You could hear just three notes and {{you knew it was}} Dusty". Wexler declared, [...] "er particular hallmark was a haunting sexual vulnerability in her voice, and she may have had the most impeccable intonation of any singer I ever heard". Greil Marcus of Rolling Stone captured Springfield's technique as [...] "a soft, sensual box (voice) that allowed her to combine syllables until they turned into pure cream." [...] She had a finely tuned musical ear and extraordinary control of tone. She sang in a variety of styles, mostly pop, soul, folk, Latin, and rock'n'roll. Being able to wrap her voice around difficult material, her repertoire included songs that their writers ordinarily would have offered to black vocalists. In the 1960s, on several occasions, she performed as the only white singer on all-black bills. Her soul orientation was so convincing that early in her solo career, US listeners who had only heard her music on radio or records sometimes assumed that she was African American. Later, a considerable number of critics observed that she sounded black and American or made a point of saying she did not.|$|E
