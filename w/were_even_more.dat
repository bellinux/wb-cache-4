5|$|Adhesion problems. The lighter loading {{on their}} driving axles {{meant that they}} <b>were</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> prone to wheelslip than the Merchant Navy class, {{requiring}} very careful control when starting a heavy train. Once underway they were noted for their free running, excellent steam production and rapid turn of speed.|$|E
5|$|Accommodations <b>were</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> {{cramped and}} poorly {{ventilated}} than earlier ships because the ammunition hoists {{passed through the}} crew spaces, a problem for ships intended for long-endurance sorties into the North Atlantic. The lack of room in the hull forced a number of workshops and offices into the superstructure which added more weight high in the ship. There were three deckhouses abaft the break in the forecastle with intervals between them to permit the beam torpedo tubes to rotate, but these were no larger than in earlier ships which meant that space was at a premium.|$|E
5|$|After the uprising, Poland {{repressed}} Lithuanian {{cultural life}} in Sejny. Lithuanian schools in Sejny (which had some 300 pupils) and surrounding villages were closed. The local Lithuanian clergy were evicted, and the Sejny Priest Seminary relocated. According to Lithuanians, the repressions <b>were</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> far-reaching, including {{a ban on}} public use of the Lithuanian language and the closing of Lithuanian organizations, which had a total of 1,300 members. The New York Times, reporting on renewed hostilities a year later, described the 1919 Sejny events as a violent occupation by the Poles, in which the Lithuanian inhabitants, teachers, and religious ministers were maltreated and expelled. Polish historian Łossowski notes that both sides mistreated the civilian population and exaggerated reports to gain internal and foreign support.|$|E

5|$|Amargasaurus was quadrupedal (moved on four legs), and {{probably}} {{was unable to}} rear on its hind legs. Salgado and Bonaparte (1991) suggested that Amargasaurus was a slow walker, as both the forearms and lower legs were proportionally short, as a feature common to slow-moving animals. This was contradicted by Gerardo Mazzetta and Richard Fariña (1999), who argued that Amargasaurus was capable of rapid locomotion. During locomotion, leg bones are strongly affected by bending moments, representing a limiting factor for the maximum speed of an animal. The leg bones of Amargasaurus <b>were</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> sturdy than those of today's white rhinoceros, which is adapted to galloping.|$|E
5|$|During {{the era of}} the {{collodion}} process, {{before the}} arrival of less demanding photographic technology (the gelatin silver process, photographic film, and smaller cameras) and the consequent rise of amateur photography, commercial photographers like Farsari had a particular importance for recording events and views. In Japan before 1899 such photographers <b>were</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> significant because the government required foreigners to obtain passes to journey to the interior, and commercial photographers based in Japan could more easily gain access and provide rare images of restricted areas. By 1889, however, Farsari estimated that about half of all visitors to Yokohama were amateur photographers; even if this was an exaggeration, the presence of increasing numbers of amateur photographers was obviously affecting the commercial photography business. To encourage amateur photographers to visit his studio and possibly buy his merchandise, Farsari provided free use of a darkroom.|$|E
5|$|Plants were {{cultivated}} {{mostly in}} small nearby gardens, but wheat and barley were also grown on small fields obtained by burning the forest. In {{the absence of}} animal-drawn plowing devices, soil was being hoed manually. The forest burning activity brought about significant ecological and environmental changes in Lesser Poland, Silesia and Kujawy. Further out were the pastures, the entire area utilized by a single settlement having a radius of about 5km. Cattle, sheep and goats <b>were</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> numerous in the northern flatlands, where the land was less fertile. The Danubian people communities kept in touch and exchanged goods over large areas, {{all the way to}} their regions of origin beyond the Carpathian Mountains.|$|E

5|$|The divines <b>were</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> {{strongly}} opposed to Catholicism than to William Laud and his followers, the Laudians. They associated both Catholicism and Laudianism with Arminianism and persecution. Before the civil war, the divines saw {{these two groups}} as {{the greatest threat to}} the church. With the rise of radical sectarian movements during the war, the divines became much more concerned with these groups than polemics against Catholicism. The divines were particularly concerned with those they labeled antinomians. This was a loose term for those who saw the moral law as in some way no longer relevant for Christians. The divines saw these groups as more immediately threatening than Catholicism.|$|E
5|$|Through {{relatives}} Playford met {{his future}} wife Lorna Clark, who lived with her family in Nailsworth. Although both families were religiously devout, the Clarks <b>were</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> so than the Playfords, and a long courtship ensued. Taking her out on his Harley Davidson motorcycle at night, the two were forced to leave the theatre halfway through performances so as to not raise the ire of the Clarks. Before their wedding on 1 January 1928, they were engaged for three years. During their engagement, Playford built their new house on his property, mostly by his own hands and indented in the hills themselves; it remained their home throughout their lives.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{the end of}} World War I and {{withdrawal}} of the Armed Forces of Central powers, she fell {{into the hands of}} the Whites under the support of the Triple Entente in November 1918. She had her engines sabotaged in April 1919 by order of the British when the Whites temporarily lost control of Sevastopol. She was further damaged by the explosion of a mine when the Whites abandoned the Crimea in 1920. Once she fell into Soviet hands she spent several years under repair, which required parts and material from her sisters that <b>were</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> damaged. She was given the proper revolutionary name of Komintern, after the Communist International on 31 December 1922 and was recommissioned in June 1923.|$|E

5|$|In early 1917, the Imperial Mounted Division {{was formed}} from the 3rd and 4th Light Horse Brigades and two British mounted brigades. The {{division}} first saw service during the First Battle of Gaza, which occurred in southern Gaza on 26 March 1917. At around noon two mounted brigades of the Anzac Mounted Division attacked Gaza {{from the north}} and east. At 6.00 pm the Turkish position had become perilous with the ring closing tightly around Gaza. However, in a decision that dismayed most of their soldiers the British commanders decided to call off the attack and retreat, delivering victory to the Turks. A second attempt was made to capture Gaza on 19 April by which time the Turkish defences <b>were</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> formidable and the task confronting the British even more difficult. This battle became known as the Second Battle of Gaza. The Anzac Mounted Division played only a minor role in this battle suffering only 105 casualties out of the 5,917 suffered. The second battle of Gaza was a disastrous defeat for the Allied forces.|$|E

Roosevelt maintained recognition of the Vichy regime until late 1942, and saw de Gaulle as an impudent representative of a minority interest.|$|E

Denard Robinson also carried the ball 13 times, but he only gained 13 yards, with his longest play of 16 yards coming in the second quarter. Martavious Odoms and Vincent Smith each had one carry, for five and two yards respectively, with Odoms' carry coming on an end-around.|$|E
25|$|Being a dicynodont, Lystrosaurus {{had only}} two teeth (a pair of tusk-like canines), and {{is thought to have}} had a horny beak that was used for biting off pieces of vegetation.

The forelimbs <b>were</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> robust than the hindlimbs, and the animal is thought to have been a powerful digger that nested in burrows.|$|E
