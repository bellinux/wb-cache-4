5|$|The labor tax {{took the}} form of conscripted labor for one month per year, which <b>was</b> <b>imposed</b> upon male commoners aged fifteen to fifty-six. This could be avoided in Eastern Han with a commutable tax, since hired labor became more popular.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of 1990s UK local {{government}} reform, York regained unitary status and saw a substantial alteration in its borders, taking in parts of Selby and Harrogate districts, and about half {{the population of the}} Ryedale district. The new boundary <b>was</b> <b>imposed</b> after central government rejected the former city council's own proposal.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{rationing}} <b>was</b> <b>imposed</b> almost immediately. Restrictions {{were immediately}} more stringent {{than in the}} Great War as with effect from 8 January 1940 ration books were issued and most foods were subject to ration. By August 1940, legislation was passed that made the wasting of food a prisonable offence. Posters encouraged kitchen waste {{to be used for}} feeding animals, primarily swine but also poultry.|$|E

50|$|Boundary {{conditions}} <b>are</b> <b>imposed</b> at {{vortex ring}} level. Vortex rings can be triangular or quadrilateral, but most importantly, {{they can be}} slender or solid. On slender rings, Neumann boundary conditions <b>are</b> <b>imposed,</b> while on solid rings, Dirichlet boundary conditions <b>are</b> <b>imposed.</b> Imposing one BC or the other implies calculating the local velocity or the local velocity potential.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, the United States posed a grain embargo upon the Soviet Union. This {{was an attempt}} by the U.S. utilize food power, however, it was not confirmed. The Soviets thus {{imported}} grain from different suppliers, leading to an increase in grain imports during that time period, only at a higher cost. Another unsuccessful embargo food power attempt <b>was</b> <b>imposed</b> by the UN Security Council in 1990 with Iraq.|$|E
5|$|On 22 July 1936, Charles Lindbergh {{departed}} Penshurst for Staaken Airfield, Berlin, {{which was}} a Luftwaffe airfield closed to civil aircraft. Lindbergh {{had been invited to}} Berlin by Hermann Göring. A press blackout <b>was</b> <b>imposed</b> on the orders of Adolf Hitler. Lindbergh made a speech to the Aero Club in Berlin which was reported in Der Volkische Beobachter.|$|E
5|$|The last carucage <b>was</b> <b>imposed</b> in 1224, {{after which}} most of the medieval government's revenue was raised by levying taxes on {{moveable}} or personal property, instead of on land; taxes on moveable property were first assessed in 1207. A probable reason for the abandonment of land taxes was the greater revenues raised by taxes on property and income.|$|E

40|$|A {{large and}} growing {{literature}} has demonstrated that imposing control on agents {{has the potential to}} backfire, leading agents to withhold effort. Consistent with principles of procedural fairness, we find that the way in which control <b>is</b> <b>imposed</b> — in particular whether control <b>is</b> <b>imposed</b> symmetrically on both principals and agents and whether both parties have a say in whether control <b>is</b> <b>imposed</b> — affects how agents respond to control. In our setting, control leads agents to withhold effort only when control <b>is</b> <b>imposed</b> unilaterally with an asymmetric affect on the agent...|$|R
5|$|The {{low level}} station {{remained}} open, although passenger numbers at that station also fell {{after the fire}} of 1936 and many services were diverted to serve London–Croydon routes instead of the Victoria–London Bridge route. Rail travel was in decline across the UK in the 1960s and 1970s when the Beeching Axe <b>was</b> <b>imposed.</b> During the 1970s, two outer platforms used by terminating trains were abandoned and the third rail was removed.|$|E
5|$|As it was {{the middle}} of the Chinese New Year, most of the Chinese Volunteers Corps were on leave, leaving Singapore almost defenceless against the mutiny. The British {{government}} was caught unprepared, and other mutineers went on a killing spree at Keppel Harbour and Pasir Panjang, killing 18 European and local civilians. Martial law <b>was</b> <b>imposed</b> and every available man from HMS Cadmus went ashore to join with British, Malay and Chinese Volunteer units and the small number of British regular troops forming part of the garrison. British Vice-Admiral Sir Martyn Jerram sent a radio message requesting help from any allied warships nearby.|$|E
5|$|Chapman {{was still}} working at the coke works in Selby when his ban <b>was</b> <b>imposed,</b> but by Christmas 1920 the company was sold up and he was laid off. Soon after, however, he was {{approached}} by Huddersfield Town to become assistant to Ambrose Langley, {{who had been a}} former team-mate of Herbert Chapman's brother Harry at The Wednesday. Huddersfield Town backed Chapman in an appeal against his ban, arguing that as he had been working at the factory in Barnbow during the war, he had not been in charge of Leeds City during the time illegal payments were paid. The ban was overturned, and Chapman was formally installed as Langley's assistant on 1 February 1921.|$|E
50|$|The United States has an {{assortment}} of federal, state, local, and special-purpose governmental jurisdictions. Each imposes taxes to fully or partly fund its operations. These taxes may <b>be</b> <b>imposed</b> on the same income, property or activity, often without offset of one tax against another. The types of tax imposed at each level of government vary, {{in part due to}} constitutional restrictions. Income taxes <b>are</b> <b>imposed</b> at the federal and most state levels. Taxes on property <b>are</b> typically <b>imposed</b> only at the local level, though there may be multiple local jurisdictions that tax the same property. Other excise taxes <b>are</b> <b>imposed</b> by the federal and some state governments. Sales taxes <b>are</b> <b>imposed</b> by most states and many local governments. Customs duties or tariffs <b>are</b> only <b>imposed</b> by the federal government. A wide variety of user fees or license fees <b>are</b> also <b>imposed.</b>|$|R

5|$|From 1859 to 1865, Kogălniceanu was {{on several}} {{occasions}} the cabinet leader in the Moldavian half of the United Principalities, then Prime Minister of Romania, being {{responsible for most of}} the reforms associated with Cuza's reign. His first term in Moldavia ended during December 1860, when Kogălniceanu became involved in the scandal involving Metropolitan Sofronie Miclescu, who opposed Cuza's secularization of the monastery estates. In 1863, secularization <b>was</b> <b>imposed</b> by Cuza, with the land thus freed being divided among peasants—the land reform of 1864, which came together with the universal abolition of corvées.|$|E
5|$|Huntsville was {{the largest}} city with no {{electricity}} from TVA. All the traffic lights were off, a dusk-to-dawn curfew <b>was</b> <b>imposed,</b> students were sent home from United States Space Camp, and the Panoply Arts Festival was canceled. Power was restored gradually to Huntsville, beginning with 3 percent {{on the morning of}} May 1. Only localized outages remained eight days after the storm. In addition to traffic and safety issues, the outage caused difficulties with water treatment and distribution and retail of all kinds, including gasoline and food purchases.|$|E
5|$|In 1400, the Mongol army under Timur, {{better known}} as Tamerlane, swept down on Syria and arrived at Damascus after having subdued Aleppo, Homs, and Baalbek. A Mamluk army from Egypt under Sultan Faraj ibn Barquq, the son of Barquq, failed to lift the siege. In 1401, the city {{surrendered}} to Timur, except for the citadel, which Timur besieged. Towers with trebuchets were set up around the citadel and in the Umayyad Mosque. The garrison surrendered after the northwestern tower was brought down through mining. The defenders were slaughtered and a heavy tribute <b>was</b> <b>imposed</b> on the citizens of Damascus. When they failed to deliver, the city was sacked and the Umayyad Mosque was burned.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after its}} opening, {{concerns}} were {{raised about the}} bridge's safety. Following an inspection by John Hawkshaw and Edwin Clark in 1861, an additional support chain was added on each side. Despite the strengthening there were still concerns about its soundness, and a weight limit of 5 tons <b>was</b> <b>imposed.</b> At the same time, the name was changed from Victoria Bridge to Chelsea Bridge, as the government {{was concerned about the}} reliability of suspension bridges and did not want a potential collapse {{to be associated with the}} Queen.|$|E
5|$|The 1224 carucage was a tax levied {{only on the}} clergy, and the {{revenues}} from it did not appear in that year's Pipe Roll. It {{is likely that the}} clergy who owed the carucage also collected the tax. Records indicate that the bulk of the money raised was paid into the Wardrobe, the king's personal treasury, rather than the Exchequer. The 1224 assessment was based on ploughteams, and <b>was</b> <b>imposed</b> to pay for the restitution of the lost lands in France.|$|E

50|$|The United States social {{insurance}} system {{is funded by}} a tax similar to an income tax. Social Security tax of 6.2% <b>is</b> <b>imposed</b> on wages paid to employees.

The maximum amount of wages subject to the tax for 2009, 2010, and 2011 was/is $106,800. This amount is indexed for inflation. A companion Medicare Tax of 1.45% of wages <b>is</b> <b>imposed</b> on employers and employees, with no limitation. A self-employment tax in like amounts (totaling 15.3%, 13.3% for 2011 and 2012) <b>is</b> <b>imposed</b> on self-employed persons.|$|R
5|$|The American Medical Association (AMA) {{opposed the}} act because the tax <b>was</b> <b>imposed</b> on {{physicians}} prescribing cannabis, retail pharmacists selling cannabis, and medical cannabis cultivation and manufacturing; instead of enacting the Marihuana Tax Act the AMA proposed cannabis {{be added to}} the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act. This approach was unappealing to some legislators who feared that adding a new substance to the Harrison Act would subject that act to new legal scrutiny. Since the federal government had no authority under the 10th Amendment to regulate medicines, that power being reserved by individual states in 1937, a tax was the only viable way to legislate marijuana.|$|E
5|$|The Naroda Patiya {{massacre}} {{took place}} on 28 February 2002 at Naroda, in Ahmedabad, India, during the 2002 Gujarat riots. 97 Muslims were killed by a mob of approximately 5,000 people, organised by the Bajrang Dal, a wing of the Vishva Hindu Parishad, {{and supported by the}} Bharatiya Janata Party which was in power in the Gujarat State Government. The massacre at Naroda occurred during the bandh (strike) called by Vishwa Hindu Parishad a day after the Godhra train burning. The riot lasted over 10 hours, during which the mob looted, stabbed, sexually assaulted, gang-raped and burnt people individually and in groups. After the conflict, a curfew <b>was</b> <b>imposed</b> in the state and army troops were called in to contain further violence.|$|E
