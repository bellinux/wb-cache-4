To suppose that God forgives or punishes sin, {{according}} as His mercy is sought or unsought, is to misunderstand Love and make prayer the safety-valve for wrong-doing.|$|R

60|$|AUSTIN. Well, Menteith, <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> make nor mend. <b>We</b> <b>cannot</b> {{play the}} jockey with Time. Age is the test; of wine, Menteith, and men.|$|R
30|$|Information {{gathering}} is a {{very important}} phase. If <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> collect information properly, thoroughly, <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> design the ontology to cover all of them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because you are immortal--and unincumbered. Because {{you can do}} {{everything}} you want to do--and <b>we</b> <b>cannot.</b> I don't know why <b>we</b> <b>cannot,</b> but <b>we</b> <b>cannot.</b> Here <b>we</b> are, with our short lives and our little souls to save, or lose, fussing for our little concerns. And you, out of the elements, come and beckon----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All these mouths <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> feed, [...] And <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> clothe these bodies." [...] Well, if man's so hard indeed, [...] Let {{them learn}} {{at least what}} God is! ...|$|R
6000|$|But, in {{a larger}} sense, <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> dedicate. [...] .<b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> consecrate. [...] . <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who {{struggled}} here have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember, what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.|$|R
5000|$|Ronald Reagan {{endorsed}} the same sentiment when he said, [...] "if <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> defend ourselves Central America...then <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> expect to prevail elsewhere... our credibility will collapse and our alliances will crumble." ...|$|R
60|$|Oh, my friends, <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> blame {{ourselves}} {{too much}} for all these sins; <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> think them too heinous. <b>We</b> <b>cannot</b> confess them too openly; <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> cry too humbly and earnestly for forgiveness. But we never shall feel the full sinfulness of sin; we never shall thoroughly humble ourselves in confession and repentance, unless we remember that all our sins have been sins against a Father, and a forgiving Father, {{and that it is}} His especial glory, the very beauty and excellence in Him, which ought to have kept us from disobeying Him, that He does forgive those who disobey Him.|$|R
60|$|But I {{come next}} to the grand objection; namely, that <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> take it off, that we do take off {{as much as we}} can use, and a very great {{quantity}} it is too; that we are not able to take more, that is to say, we know not what to do with it if we take it; that <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> manufacture it, or if <b>we</b> do, <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> sell the goods; and so, according to the known rule in trade, that what cannot be done with profit or without loss, we may say of it that it cannot be done; so in the sense of trade, <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> take their wool off, and if they must run it over to France, they must, <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> help it.|$|R
6000|$|Nay, we {{can never}} be as wise as thou, [...] O idle singer 'neath the blossomed bough. [...] Nay, and <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> be content to die. [...] <b>We</b> <b>cannot</b> shirk the {{questions}} 'Where?' and 'How?' ...|$|R
5000|$|Splitting Doesn’t Hold. Like FD’s, <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> {{generally}} {{split the}} left side of an MVD.But unlike FD’s, <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> split the right side either, sometimes you have to leave several attributes on the right side.|$|R

"Gentlemen, 'Look {{the devil}} {{straight}} in the face, if you would {{hit him in the}} right place.' <b>We</b> <b>cannot</b> get the ship to sea as she is; and if <b>we</b> could, <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> go home empty-handed; and <b>we</b> surely <b>cannot</b> stay here to die of fever.--We must leave the ship and go inland." ...|$|R
30|$|The {{data will}} not be shared. Given the low {{incidence}} of Lynch Syndrome and the high risk nature of the population, <b>we</b> believe <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> guarantee confidentiality of our patient subjects. Therefore, <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> release this data.|$|R
5000|$|<b>We</b> <b>cannot</b> {{say with}} {{language}} what {{is common in}} the structures, rather it must be shown, because any language we use will also rely on this relationship, and so <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> step out of our language with language.|$|R

5000|$|<b>We</b> <b>cannot</b> bring a cable into Lough Foyle, {{because the}} border line {{under the sea}} there is {{actually}} disputed.... Lough Foyle is a disputed border region, and, as I said, <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> put submarine cables near disputed border regions.|$|R
2500|$|It {{has been}} argued that, because <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> {{understand}} advanced civilizations, <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> predict their behavior.

60|$|To {{say that}} an idea is {{necessary}} {{is simply to}} affirm that <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> conceive the contrary; {{and the fact that}} <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> conceive the contrary of any belief may be a presumption, but is certainly no proof, of its truth.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, nephew," [...] {{she said}} placidly, [...] "if <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> get away, <b>we</b> cannot; {{and it really}} saves a world of trouble. But {{what are you going}} to do yourself? for I suppose if <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> get away, you cannot." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Gentlemen, we {{can handle}} the various brotherhoods, but <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> handle the A. R. U. We have got to wipe it out. We can handle the other leaders, but <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> handle Debs. <b>We</b> have got to wipe him out too." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>We,</b> if <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> {{resolve this}} matter diplomatically, will take {{international}} legal action.

5000|$|<b>We</b> <b>cannot</b> {{adequately}} {{appreciate this}} aspect of nature if we approach it with any taint of human pretense. It will elude us if we allow artifacts like clothing to intervene between ourselves and this Other. To apprehend it, <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> be naked enough.|$|R
30|$|<b>We</b> <b>cannot</b> {{stop looking}} for it.|$|R
60|$|Secondly. <b>We</b> <b>cannot</b> {{permanently}} {{prevent their}} action. If we arrest them, <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> long hold them as prisoners, and when liberated they will immediately reassemble {{and take their}} action; and precisely the same if we simply disperse them--they will immediately reassemble in some other place.|$|R
40|$|Continued {{crime against}} {{humanity}} that capitalism and the EU are perpetrated against tens of thousands of people forced to migrate, causing a terrible catastrophe, before which <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> remain silent, and to which <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> commit obscenity adopted by certain fallacious theories that seek to blame some drama called “mafias”...|$|R
5000|$|... i) A {{description}} of the whole of society is impossible because the list of characteristics making up such a description would be infinite.

5000|$|Judd was {{a strong}} {{advocate}} of the foreign aid program, a position which brought him into sharp contrast with colleague Otto Passman, a Democrat from Monroe, Louisiana who chaired the House Foreign Operations Subcommittee, which maintains jurisdiction over such programs. Passman explained his longstanding criticism of the program: [...] "First, <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> spend ourselves rich. Second, <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> make ourselves secure by giving ourselves away. Third, <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> buy friends. <b>We</b> were once told that foreign aid would stop communism. Now we are told it is our duty to buy {{our way of life}} for countries all over the world. But <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> in fact improve their living standards by as much as 1 percent even if we should give away everything we own." ...|$|R
