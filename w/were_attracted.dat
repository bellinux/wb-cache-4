5|$|Under Lord Fairfax's ownership, the Cacapon River Valley was {{predominantly}} {{inhabited by}} English-speaking settlers {{as early as}} the late 1730s.

5|$|During {{the late}} 1960s {{to the early}} 1980s, a number of German, Dutch and Swiss {{settlers}} <b>were</b> <b>attracted</b> to Banagher, mainly because of its proximity to the River Shannon and associated lifestyle.

5|$|In nature, it was {{observed}} that males would venture away from the nest in order to attract females. The males would press their gastral sterna against a perch and rub their mandibular against it. This is used to attract females, and females were observed to visit these branches and sample the scents. Interestingly, it was also found that on some occasions, males <b>were</b> <b>attracted</b> to other male scents.|$|E
5|$|Monster Inc. is an American {{company that}} {{manufactures}} and markets about 6,000 products, but {{is best known}} for audio and video cables. It also produces speakers, headphones, power strips, mobile accessories and audio devices for automobiles. The company was founded by an audiophile and engineer, Noel Lee, in 1979 by experimenting with different ways to build audio cables. It grew by doing demonstrations to convince the industry that audio cables made a difference in audio quality and by establishing relationships with retailers that <b>were</b> <b>attracted</b> to the cable's profit margins.|$|E
5|$|The Skagen Painters were a {{group of}} Scandinavian artists who visited the area every summer from the late 1870s until {{the turn of the}} century. They <b>were</b> <b>attracted</b> by the scenery, the {{fishermen}} and the quality of light which encouraged them to paint en plein air following the example of the French Impressionists while sometimes adopting the Realist approach of the Barbizon School. They broke away from the rigid traditions of the Danish and Swedish art academies, preferring the modern trends they had experienced in Paris.|$|E

5|$|A {{laboratory}} test showed how males of P. fimbriata from Queensland minimise {{the risk of}} meeting each other, by recognising fresh pieces of blotting paper, some containing their own silk draglines and some containing another male's draglines. Males also <b>were</b> <b>attracted</b> by fresh blotting paper containing females' draglines, while females {{do not respond to}} fresh blotting paper containing males' draglines. This suggested that the males usually search for females, rather than vice versa. Neither sex responded to one week-old blotting paper, irrespective of whether it contained males' or females' draglines. A similar series of tests showed that P. labiata showed the same patterns of responses between the sexes.|$|E
5|$|In the late-19th century, the Sleaford {{area was}} a major barley {{producer}} and by the 1880s, Sleaford was a stop on railway lines connecting the town to Boston, Grantham, Bourne, Spalding and Lincoln. These qualities made the town desirable {{for the production of}} malt, a crucial ingredient in beer production. The brewers Bass, Ratcliffe and Gretton Ltd <b>were</b> <b>attracted</b> to the town and in 1880 proposed a new malting complex there, which would consolidate malting closer to the barley source and reduce costs by up-scaling production. Drilling in 1892 revealed suitable artesian water sources under Sleaford; plans were submitted nine years later and over 13 acres of land off Mareham Lane was purchased; work started in 1901 and was complete by 1907.|$|E
50|$|In The 16 Strivings for God Reiss {{develops}} {{the theory that}} people embrace religion because it provides them with opportunities to satisfy all 16 basic desires both in strong form and in weak form.

5|$|In the {{ten years}} after the fall of Zaculeu various Spanish expeditions crossed into the Sierra de los Cuchumatanes and engaged in the gradual and complex conquest of the Chuj and Q'anjob'al. The Spanish <b>were</b> <b>attracted</b> to the region in the hope of extracting gold, silver and other riches from the {{mountains}} but their remoteness, the difficult terrain and relatively low population made their conquest and exploitation extremely difficult. The population of the Cuchumatanes is estimated to have been 260,000 before European contact. By the time the Spanish physically arrived in the region this had collapsed to 150,000 because {{of the effects of the}} Old World diseases that had run ahead of them.|$|E
5|$|Inexperienced as a manager, Barrow had player Harry Hooper {{advise him}} on {{baseball}} game strategy. Hooper urged his manager to allow Ruth to play another position {{when he was}} not pitching, arguing to Barrow, who had invested in the club, that the crowds were larger on days when Ruth played, as they <b>were</b> <b>attracted</b> by his hitting. Barrow gave in early in May; Ruth promptly hit home runs in four consecutive games (one an exhibition), the last off of Walter Johnson. For {{the first time in his}} career (disregarding pinch-hitting appearances), Ruth was assigned a place in the batting order higher than ninth.|$|E
5|$|Longfellow {{oversaw the}} {{creation}} of a formal garden and his wife oversaw decorating the interior. Mrs. Longfellow purchased several items from Tiffany's in New York as well as $350 worth of carpets. They installed central heating in 1850 and gaslight in 1853. During their time in the house, the Longfellows hosted famous artists, writers, politicians and other luminaries who <b>were</b> <b>attracted</b> to Longfellow's hospitality and fame. Specific visitors included Charles Dickens, William Makepeace Thackeray, singer Jenny Lind, and actress Fanny Kemble. Dom Pedro II, Emperor of Brazil also visited the house privately and requested the company of Longfellow, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr., and James Russell Lowell. Mr. and Mrs. Longfellow also raised their three daughters and two sons in the home. Longfellow and his wife stayed in the home until their respective deaths but spent their summers after 1850 in Nahant, Massachusetts.|$|E

5|$|Not all of {{the monks}} <b>were</b> <b>attracted</b> by Symeon's zealous approach. Symeon {{attempted}} to reform the Byzantine monasteries, where monks had become subservient to the emperor and had acquired large holdings of property, libraries, and art. His writings and teachings were aimed at returning the monasteries to their traditional role in the early church, urging the monks {{to take up a}} life of simplicity, asceticism, purity of heart, and constant prayer. The strict monastic discipline for which Symeon aimed upset several monks in the monastery. Symeon also took a more emotional approach to worship, suggesting that a monk shouldn't take the sacrament without tears. The introduction of vegetarian meals, along with other unique practices to instill discipline and humility, also caused some displeasure among the monks.|$|E
5|$|The English {{settlers}} <b>were</b> <b>attracted</b> to the Darby Creek watershed due to {{the proximity}} to trading routes and productive landscape. In 1777, British soldiers breached dikes and floodwalls that were constructed on the creek. The Pennsylvania legislature passed an act in 1788 that mandated a maintenance of the dikes and the mowing of plants such as elderberries and pokeweed three times a year. Early English colonists utilized Darby Creek {{as a source of}} water power. Lumber, grist, and textile mills were established {{along the banks of the}} creek. Most of these mills have been demolished, although some of the tenement structures are currently in use as housing. At the end of the 19th century, industrial advances such as engine-driven machinery had made these mills obsolete.|$|E
5|$|The native {{environment}} stayed relatively intact until settlers {{began to}} arrive in western Idaho in great numbers in the 1870s, and miners also <b>were</b> <b>attracted</b> by a gold strike at nearby Orofino, {{on the banks of}} the Clearwater River. Many of these emigrants set up dryland farms and ranches in the prairies surrounding the Potlatch River. Soil conditions generally improve as one travels southwards through the watershed, but there was a major drawback to growing crops in the southern part of the basin: the inaccessibility of water. Already scarce in the arid Potlatch River drainage, the river's water was hard to reach because of the steep canyon it passes through in most of its lower course. Farmers were restricted to growing crops that did not require irrigation, and many of the lands that did not have access to abundant-enough water were relegated to pasture or hay producing status.|$|E
