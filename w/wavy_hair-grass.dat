5|$|The hilltops {{are covered}} in {{heathland}} of gorse, heather, bracken and thorn with plantations of conifer. The {{western side of the}} Quantocks are steep scarp slopes of pasture, woods and parkland. Deep stream-cut combes to the north-east contain extensive oak-woods with small flower-rich bogs above them. The areas where there is limited drainage are dominated by heather (Calluna vulgaris), with significant populations of cross-leaved heath (Erica tetralix), purple moor-grass (Molinia caerulea), bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) and <b>wavy</b> <b>hair-grass</b> (Deschampsia flexuosa). Drier areas are covered with bell heather (Erica cinerea), western gorse (Ulex gallii) and bristle bent (Agrostis curtisii), while bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) is common on well-drained deeper soils. The springs and streams provide a specialist environment that supports bog pimpernel (Anagallis tenella). The woodland is generally birch/sessile oak woodland, valley alder woodland and ash/wych elm woodland, which support a rich lichen flora. Alfoxton Wood is one of only three British locations where the lichen Tomasellia lectea is present.|$|E
25|$|The drier {{areas of}} heath have a grassy character, with typical species being {{matgrass}} (Nardus stricta) and <b>wavy</b> <b>hair-grass</b> (Deschampsia flexuosa). Common tormentil (Potentilla erecta), dovesfoot cranesbill (Geranium molle), heath bedstraw (Galium saxatile), heath milkwort (Polygala serpyllifolia) and heath rush (Juncus squarrosus) {{have also been}} recorded, as has the locally rare bird's-foot (Ornithopus perpusillus) and shepherd's cress (Teesdalia nudicaulis).|$|E
25|$|The {{habitat in}} the valleys of the Cong Burn, and its {{tributary}} Little Burn, and the South Burn, is broadleaved woodland. The principal species are sessile oak, Quercus petraea, birch, Betula pubescens and hazel, Corylus avellana, with alder, Alnus glutinosa, locally dominant along the watercourses and at spring-lines. The understorey includes species such as <b>wavy</b> <b>hair-grass,</b> Deschampsia flexuosa, common bracken, Pteridium aquilinum, broad buckler fern, Dryopteris dilatata, and rowan, Sorbus aucuparia.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the common heather (Calluna vulgaris) only a few taller plants occur here, none {{of which can be}} classed as characteristic species. Amongst them are the <b>wavy</b> <b>hair-grass</b> (Deschampsia flexuosa) and common juniper (Juniperus communis). Ordinary sand heath is the most widespread of the heathland types. Its proportion has increased in recent decades {{at the expense of other}} heath habitats. This reduction in the variety of heathland types may be due to increasing nitrogen levels from the air, the increase in plant litter (Rohhumusauflagen) and the natural ageing of the heathland.|$|E

50|$|The {{heathland}} {{areas are}} dominated by heather and gorse, with some bilberry and goldenrod. Drier spots are indicated by the occurrence of bell heather. Fine-leaved fescues, <b>wavy</b> <b>hair-grass</b> and purple moor-grass dominate the acid grassland areas {{with a mix of}} wood sage, heath bedstraw and other typical species. Marsh violet and hard fern (both London rarities) occur in the damper areas.|$|E
50|$|The {{predominant}} vegetation is blanket mire, {{in which}} heather, Calluna vulgaris, and hare's-tail cottongrass, Eriophorum vaginatum, are co-dominant. On higher ground, to the west, dwarf shrubs such as cloudberry, Rubus chamaemorus, and crowberry, Empetrum nigrum, are more frequent. Where steep slopes have inhibited peat formation, the blanket mire {{gives way to}} dry heath, in which heather, <b>wavy</b> <b>hair-grass,</b> Deschampsia flexuosa, and bilberry, Vaccinium myrtillus, are the dominant species.|$|E
50|$|The Thanet Sands have eroded, but the Blackheath {{beds are}} bound by a natural cement, and this has {{resisted}} erosion to make a natural cap to the hill. The top is mainly bare of trees, with rounded pebbles made when the area was the base of shallow seas in the Eocene epoch around 50 million years ago. The sparse vegetation at the top is mainly <b>wavy</b> <b>hair-grass,</b> heather and bilberry.|$|E
50|$|In the species-poor oak, beech {{and pine}} woods the ground flora mainly {{consists}} of acid-soil loving (acidophilic) species. Examples are great wood-rush, white wood-rush, pill sedge and <b>wavy</b> <b>hair-grass.</b> Also characteristic are various species of fern such as deer fern, lemon-scented fern and royal fern, which prefer shady, temperate, wet locations. Another {{feature of the}} bunter sandstone mountains are its rich mushroom and berry communities. Blueberries cover large areas and, in suitable places, cowberries.|$|E
50|$|Where a {{skeletal}} soil layer has developed on the quarry floor and spoil heaps, patches of grassland occur, with species characteristic of base-rich soils, such as quaking grass, Briza media, and limestone bedstraw, Galium sterneri. On shallow slopes, this {{gives way to}} a neutral grassland characterised by false oat-grass, Arrhenatherum elatius, and Yorkshire fog, Holcus lanatus. Above the quarry, this is replaced by acid grassland, in which <b>wavy</b> <b>hair-grass,</b> Deschampsia flexuosa, is dominant.|$|E
50|$|The {{vegetation}} {{is dominated}} by grasses and herbaceous plants, growing on soils deficient in lime (calcium). These may be found on acid sedimentary rock such as sandstone; acid igneous rock such as granite; and fluvial or glacial deposits such as sand and gravel. Typical plants of lowland acid grassland in Britain include common bent grass, Agrostis capillaris, <b>wavy</b> <b>hair-grass,</b> Deschampsia flexuosa, bristle bent grass, Agrostis curtisii, tormentil, Potentilla erecta, and flowers such as sheep's sorrel, Rumex acetosella and heath bedstraw, Galium saxatile.|$|E

50|$|The drier valley slopes have grazed acidic {{grassland}} {{characterized by}} tormentil (Potentilla erecta), <b>wavy</b> <b>hair-grass</b> (Deschampsia flexuosa), heath bedstraw (Galium saxatile), pig nut (Conopodium majus), and mosses (Polytrichum spp.). Distinctive wet flushes descend these dry slopes and, {{where there is}} a deeper accumulation of soil, bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) is dominant, interspersed with grass-heath areas and willow and hawthorn scrub. These ffridd areas are of importance for birds, particularly nesting whinchat, tree pipit, yellowhammer, linnet, curlew, and grasshopper warbler. Red kites, buzzards, sparrow hawks, kestrels, and goshawks are a common sight in the valley.|$|E
50|$|The {{dry heath}} is {{dominated}} by heather, Calluna vulgaris, and <b>wavy</b> <b>hair-grass,</b> Deschampsia flexuosa; the regionally rare bearberry, Arctostaphylos uva-ursi, is found on the higher parts of Blanchland Moor. Other noteworthy plants are the nationally scarce pale forget-me-not, Myosotis stolonifera, and the regionally rare round-leaved crowfoot, Ranunculus omiophyllus, and ivy-leaved bellflower, Wahlenbergia hederacea, all of which occur {{in the vicinity of}} streams, and the nationally scarce spring sandwort, Minuartia verna, {{one of a number of}} metallophytes that occur on old spoil heaps around disused lead-mines on Stanhope Common.|$|E
50|$|From a botanical {{perspective}} many rock regions form biotopes with particularly {{hardy and}} undemanding sandstone vegetation, that is mainly composed of mountain pine, common heather and simple grasses (e. g. <b>wavy</b> <b>hair-grass),</b> and, in wet areas, also mosses and ferns. In addition, since the 1980s, peregrine falcons have {{settled on a}} host of rocks, so that restrictions have had to be introduced for climbers, walkers and special users. In order to avoid conflicts of usage these regulations (out-of-bounds areas and the guarding of breeding rocks) are laid down annually by the Palatine Climbing Association and the Palatine Conservation Clubs (e. g. the Peregrine Conservation Working Group (Arbeitskreis Wanderfalkenschutz) of NABU).|$|E
50|$|Over {{most of the}} area, {{the habitat}} is heathland, in which the {{dominant}} species is ling, Calluna vulgaris, except on shallower soils, where bilberry, Vaccinium myrtillus, and, to a lesser extent, crowberry, Empetrum nigrum, are dominant.The habitat in the valleys of the Cong Burn, and its tributary Little Burn, and the South Burn, is broadleaved woodland. The principal species are sessile oak, Quercus petraea, birch, Betula pubescens and hazel, Corylus avellana, with alder, Alnus glutinosa, locally dominant along the watercourses and at spring-lines.

50|$|The hilltops {{are covered}} in {{heathland}} of gorse, heather, bracken and thorn with plantations of conifer. The {{western side of the}} Quantocks are steep scarp slopes of pasture, woods and parkland. Deep stream-cut combes to the north-east contain extensive oak-woods with small flower-rich bogs above them. The areas where there is limited drainage are dominated by heather (Calluna vulgaris), with significant populations of cross-leaved heath (Erica tetralix), purple moor-grass (Molinia caerulea), bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) and <b>wavy</b> <b>hair-grass</b> (Deschampsia flexuosa). Drier areas are covered with bell heather (Erica cinerea), western gorse (Ulex gallii) and bristle bent (Agrostis curtisii), while bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) is common on well-drained deeper soils. The springs and streams provide a specialist environment that supports bog pimpernel (Anagallis tenella). The woodland is generally birch/sessile oak woodland, valley alder woodland and ash/wych elm woodland, which support a rich lichen flora. Alfoxton Wood is one of only three British locations where the lichen Tomasellia lectea is present.|$|E
50|$|Spruce woods {{thrive in}} the highest {{locations}} from about 800 m to the tree line at around 1,000 m above sea level. These woods are also home to some deciduous trees such as rowan, silver and downy birches (Betula pendula and Betula pubescens) and willows (Salix spec.). Conditions of high humidity foster an environment rich in mosses and lichens. In spite of the near-natural habitat {{there are only a}} few, indigenous, genetically adapted (autochthone) spruce trees. Wood-reed spruce woods dominate. A well developed ground vegetation thrives on their moderately rocky and fresh, but certainly not wet, soils, characterised in appearance especially by grasses such as shaggy wood-reed (Calamagrostis villosa) and <b>wavy</b> <b>hair-grass</b> (Avenella flexuosa). The soils in the higher regions are, as in most of the Harz, comparatively poor in nutrients and bases, so that only a few herbaceous plants occur here, such as heath bedstraw (Galium saxatile). For that reason it is more the ferns, mosses, lichens and fungi that, in addition to spruce trees, characterise these woods. Boulders and stone runs occur in the areas of weather-resistant rock in the high (alti-)montane and montane zones - these are extreme habitats for vegetation. Due to the lack of soil material, only weak, straggly, very open spruce woods thrive here. They have an especially high variety of trees and allow more room of light-loving species such as silver birch, rowan, sycamore, willow and dwarf bushes such as the blueberry (Vaccinium myrtillus). Mosses and ferns are also common here. One unusual species is the Carpathian birch (Betula pubescens subsp. carpatica). Bog-spruce woods are found around the raised bogs on marshy and boggy soils. In these sorts of places spruce woods can, in exceptional cases, also form the natural woodland in lower down the mountains. These wet, moorland woods have a high proportion of peat mosses (Sphagnum spec.). The ground vegetation may also have a rich proliferation of low bushes such as cowberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea). Clumps of purple moor grass (Molinia caerulea) are also typical of this type of woodland habitat. The characteristic species of fungi in natural spruce woods are Phellinus viticola and prunes and custard (Tricholomopsis decora).Ravine (Schluchtwald), riparian (Auwald) and river source (Quellwald) woods only occur in small areas. In these places the common beech gives way to hardier deciduous species such as sycamore, large-leaved lime (Tilia platyphyllos), Scots elm or ash. The herbaceous layer {{is similar to that of}} the better-nourished beech woods. Notable species amongst the plant communities here include the Alpine blue-sow-thistle (Cicerbita alpina), perennial honesty (Lunaria rediviva), hard shield fern (Polystichum aculeatum) and long beech fern (Phegopteris connectilis).|$|E
40|$|The mass {{conversion}} of heathland to grassland in north-western Europe the past decades {{is a typical}} example of how tipping points threaten the biodiversity and ecosystem services delivered by biota. Different explanations have been provided for this conversion, with nitrogen enrichment resulting from anthropogenic activities being a commonly supported hypothesis. Here we present a mathematical model to investigate {{the conditions under which}} the {{conversion of}} heathland to grassland can occur. The model describes indirect competition for light and nitrogen between heather dwarf shrub (Calluna vulgaris) and <b>wavy</b> <b>hair-grass</b> (Deschampsia flexuosa), while both species also over-shade each other. Nutrient co-limitation in the model is described using the Synthesizing Unit concept. Over-shading is found to play a pivotal role in the existence of alternative stable states in the model. Under constant light availability a combination of over-shading and enrichment with ammonia leads to a regime shift from heathland to grassland, while under enrichment with ammonia alone there is coexistence between the two species. These results are supported by experimental findings in the literature...|$|E
40|$|Heather (Calluna vulgaris), {{rosebay willowherb}} (Epilobium angustifolium), <b>wavy</b> <b>hair-grass</b> (Deschampsia flexuosa) and {{raspberry}} (Rubus idaeus) are typical species on boreal clear-cut sites. According to our study, {{they all had}} clear and species-specific annual cycles of photosynthetic activity (Pmax). The maxima of C. vulgaris and E. angustifolium occurred around June and July, while that of R. idaeus occurred as late as in August. The photosynthetic activity of C. vulgaris followed the temperature history closely when the soil moisture was high. Deciduous D. flexuosa also followed the temperature history, unlike E. angustifolium and R. idaeus. During a short drought, some shoots decreased their Pmax levels {{but none of the}} species showed congruent reactions within individuals. In general, we noticed that the comparison of Pmax or respiration of different shoots caused less discrepancy when based on ground area than on leaf mass. Using species composition and continuous temperature and light measurements, we upscaled the species-specific process rates and integrated fixed and respired CO 2 of ground vegetation during an entire growing season 2005. The photosynthetic production of ground vegetation was 760 g C m&minus; 2 y&minus; 1 at the fertile site and 300 g C m&minus; 2 y&minus; 1 at the infertile site. During the snow-free period (18 April– 21 November), C. vulgaris respired 68 g C m&minus; 2 y&minus; 1 and E. angustifolium 7 g C m&minus; 2 y&minus; 1 at the infertile site.

40|$|Heather (Calluna vulgaris), {{rosebay willowherb}} (Epilobium angustifolium), <b>wavy</b> <b>hair-grass</b> (Deschampsia flexuosa) and {{raspberry}} (Rubus idaeus) are typical species at boreal clear-cut sites. In this study, we measured their photosynthesis separately {{in the growing}} season of 2005 using a manual chamber. All measured species showed clear and species-specific seasonal cycles of photosynthetic activity (Pmax). The maxima of C. vulgaris and E. angustifolium occurred around June and July, while that of R. idaeus occurred as late as August. A simple model of photosynthetic activity is presented, addressing the photosynthesis of C. vulgaris was mainly explained by temperature history when the soil moisture is high. The activity of deciduous D. flexuosa also followed the temperature history, unlike the activities of E. angustifolium and R. idaeus. During a short drought, some shoots decreased their Pmax levels {{but none of the}} species showed similar reactions between individuals. We also observed that the comparison of the whole-plant Pmax or respiration of different-sized individuals were less scattered than the results based on full-grown leaf mass, implying that species-specific rates of photosynthesis at ground level are rather similar regardless of the plant size. Using species composition and continuous temperature and light measurements, we upscaled the species-specific process rates and integrated fixed and respired CO 2 of ground vegetation for the entire 2005 growing season. The photosynthetic production per surface area of soil was 760 g C m&minus; 2 y&minus; 1 at the fertile site and 300 g C m&minus; 2 y&minus; 1 at the infertile site. During the snow-free period (18 April– 21 November), the above ground parts of measured species released 75 g C m&minus; 2 y&minus; 1 at the infertile site.

30|$|Moth {{outbreaks}} in the 1960 s destroyed {{about two-thirds}} of the mountain birch forests in northernmost Finland (Tenow 1972). For example, in the year 1964 – 65 in Utsjoki, autumnal moths defoliated 1350  km 2. One of the herders described the situation as follows: “They just ate everything, the ground vegetation, too. It’s just open, from here {{all the way to the}} north, to Pestausselkä 10  km…[] There is nothing but open, flat (landscape) once you drive some 20  km to Inari. There used to be birches before. These green caterpillars, 2 or 3 on each leaf - just count how many there were in each tree. It was just … you should just listen to it.” (M 6). According to herders, “the oddest thing was the green leaves in the autumns; after the moth outbreak if the weather is warm enough, green leaves will sprout.” (M 7, F 1). These late-summer leaves attracted reindeer to browse again. <b>Wavy</b> <b>hair-grass,</b> which reindeer grazed on (Rybråten and Hovelsrud 2010 : 323), grew well for many years before it disappeared and the landscape changed into open land with black soil, like “the surface of the moon”. (M 1). As one of the herders noted: “The foliage destroyed by autumnal moth outbreaks in the 1960 s has not yet recovered; what we see is a biological death; it has been a poison (M 8). What had been forests became open tundra (Lehtonen and Yli-Rekola 1979; Haukioja et al. 1988; Klemola et al. 2003 : 354). Still today rotten birch stumps or peaty hummocks signal former birch habitats (Holtmeier et al. 2003). The birch defoliation in 1960 was most probably connected to the combined response to mass moth outbreaks, reindeer browsing, rotting roots and cold summers (Lehtonen and Heikkinen 1995; Holtmeier et al. 2003; Holtmeier and Broll 2006; Holtmeier 2012 : 7; Huttunen et al. 2012, 2013).|$|E
30|$|A {{few years}} after a mass moth outbreak, <b>wavy</b> <b>hair-grass</b> (Deschampsia flexuosa) colonized the soil around the birches due to the {{combined}} impact of nutrients from moth larva faeces, increased light reaching the ground {{after the death of}} the birch canopy and decreased competition given that the larvae also destroy the dominant dwarf shrubs (Rybråten and Hovelsrud 2010). As a herder from Kaldoaivi explained: “It went like this; first there was lichen, then autumnal moths ate the buds, then there was grass, this height; the grass killed the lichen. Our reindeer were really fat; then the grass ran out and mosses came, which meant no more nutrition (M 6). As new forage appeared, the reindeer had no need to make any immediate changes. After 4 to 10  years, however, the disappearance of the grass affected the movements of the female reindeer and each year they had to enlarge their foraging areas. Changing the pasture rotation is a slow process, as seen in Abisko, Sweden, where the damaged pastures were abandoned slowly (Van Bogaert et al. 2011). Both the moth outbreaks and border closures were more serious and permanent incidents than the occasional harsh winter weather. Negotiations were conducted and new arrangements made between the siidas, which were forced to change their nomadic routes. In the worst case, the herders started to lose their reindeer for good. Reindeer took on the role from the moths as key constructor of the shared niche and modified their own forage resources by depleting them. Moths first destroyed the primary grazing lands of reindeer, after which the reindeer, as flexible herbivores, carried on the destruction by browsing the damaged birch trees and later grazing on the new grass that appeared. Because parts of the niche were abandoned, the reindeer were forced to extend their pasture rotation to new lands. Here one can see a niche being constructed in a positive way by the action of an animal itself.|$|E
