5|$|It was {{initially}} thought that Tillingbourne would {{be sold to}} another operator, with four companies reported to be interested. However, by early April 2001, {{it became clear that}} this <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> place, as the offers submitted were lower than the value of the vehicles owned by the company.|$|E
5|$|On 8 March 2010, Wilders {{announced}} that he would take a seat on the Hague city council, after it became clear he won 13,000 preference votes. Earlier he had said he <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> up a seat if he won.|$|E
5|$|In February 2006 {{there were}} rumours that a 'third party' (believed to be a {{consortium}} headed by banker Sir Adrian Montague) had {{expressed an interest}} in buying out the present partners in the project. LCR shareholders rejected the proposal, and the government, which effectively could overrule shareholders' decisions as a result of LCR's reclassification as a state-owned body, decided that discussions with shareholders <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> place imminently, effectively backing shareholders' views on the proposed takeover.|$|E
6000|$|... "She <b>would</b> <b>n't</b> <b>take</b> you at any price," [...] said Fanny, remembering Polly's look of {{disappointment}} and disapproval {{when she came}} on her last visit and found him an unmistakable dandy.|$|R
6000|$|... "And she <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have <b>taken</b> any. She <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have <b>taken</b> a {{penny of}} it, though {{we need not}} mind that now; need we? But {{there is one thing}} I want to say; you must not think I am interfering." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not often; but" [...] And {{there she}} stuck, for {{the fear of}} being ungrateful or unkind made her almost hope that he <b>would</b> <b>n't</b> <b>take</b> the hint which she had been {{carefully}} preparing for him.|$|R
5|$|The {{stakes were}} raised in the {{conflict}} on 10 October, when the High Court declared valid the Act granting the territories two senators each. In a half-Senate election, most successful candidates <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> their places until 1 July 1976, but the territories' senators, and those filling Field's and Bunton's seats, would assume their seats at once. This gave Labor an outside chance of controlling the Senate, at least until 1 July 1976.|$|E
5|$|After a {{successful}} first contest, the second faced several location problems. The event originally {{should have been}} organised by British broadcaster ITV in Manchester. ITV then announced that due to financial and scheduling reasons, the contest <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> place in the United Kingdom after all. It is also thought that another factor to their decision was the previous years' audience ratings for ITV which were below the expected amount. The EBU approached Croatian broadcaster HRT, who had won the previous contest, to stage the event in Zagreb; though it later emerged that HRT had 'forgotten' to book the venue in which the contest would have taken place. It was at this point, with five months remaining until the event would be held, that Norwegian broadcaster NRK stepped in to host the contest in Lillehammer.|$|E
5|$|Amundsen did not {{publicise}} {{his change}} of plan. As Scott's biographer David Crane points out, the expedition's {{public and private}} funding was earmarked for scientific work in the Arctic; there was {{no guarantee that the}} backers would understand or agree to the proposed volte-face. Furthermore, the altered objective might cause Nansen to revoke the use of Fram, or parliament to halt the expedition for fear of undermining Scott and offending the British. Amundsen concealed his intentions from everyone except his brother Leon and his second-in-command, Nilsen. This secrecy led to awkwardness; Scott had sent Amundsen instruments to enable their two expeditions, at opposite ends of the earth, to make comparative readings. When Scott, in Norway to test his motor sledges, telephoned Amundsen's home to discuss cooperation, the Norwegian <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> the call.|$|E

60|$|She {{reviewed}} {{the events of}} her married life. The strikes and the hard times had caused everything. If {{it had not been}} for the strike of the shopmen and the fight in her front yard, she <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have lost her baby. If Billy had not been made desperate by the idleness and the hopeless fight of the teamsters, he <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have <b>taken</b> to drinking. If they had not been hard up, they <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have <b>taken</b> a lodger, and Billy <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be in jail.|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{she brought}} the baby," [...] exclaimed Ethel. [...] "I should have thought she <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have <b>taken</b> her out before her christening." ...|$|R
5|$|By August 8, 2013, when he {{was ranked}} as the 38th best {{prospect}} in the national class of 2014 and its 8th best point guard by ESPN, he had several offers and named Iowa, Kentucky (although {{he did not have}} an offer from them at the time), Michigan State and USC as his finalists (eliminating DePaul, Florida State, Northwestern and Purdue). Walton, Tyler's cousin, had played for Michigan State. He received an official offer from Kentucky on August 16. In early September, Ulis announced that he <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> an official visit to USC and had eliminated them from consideration. On September 13, Ulis committed to Kentucky. Subsequently, Tyus Jones canceled his September 2729 official visit to Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began in}} March 1958 {{to enlarge the}} village to house a {{population}} of 15,000 and the basics were completed {{by the time that}} the French granted independence on 28 November 1960. Nouakchott was planned with the expectation that commerce and other economic activities <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> place in the city. Nouakchott's central business district was planned with broad streets and a grid-like structure; the new Cinquième Quartier (Fifth District) was located close to this area and became the location of a large open-air market and residential area within a few years. During the 1960s, the city obtained its own local government. By the 1970s, these new areas had grown so much that they replaced the old ksar in terms of importance, as they also hosted the governmental buildings and state enterprises.|$|E
5|$|Feminists in Ireland in {{the early}} 20th century {{included}} the revolutionary Irish Republican, suffragette and socialist Constance Markievicz who in 1918 {{was the first woman}} elected to the British House of Commons. However, in line with Sinn Féin abstentionist policy, she <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> her seat in the House of Commons. She was re-elected to the Second Dáil in the elections of 1921. She was also a commander of the Irish Citizens Army which was led by the socialist & self-described feminist, Irish leader James Connolly during the 1916 Easter Rising.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} Murder, She Wrote, Lansbury {{returned}} to the theatre. Although cast in the lead role in the 2001 Kander and Ebb musical The Visit, she withdrew before it opened due to her husband's deteriorating health. Peter died in January 2003 {{of congestive heart failure}} at the couple's Brentwood, California home. Lansbury felt that after this event she <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> on any more major acting roles, and that instead might make a few cameo appearances but nothing more. Wanting to spend more time in New York City, in 2006 she purchased a $2 million condominium in Manhattan, and in a 2014 interview noted that she also had homes in Ireland and Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|Gil Stein, {{president}} of the NHL, indicated that the league <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> disciplinary action against Aubut, and the Rangers did not challenge the arbitrator's decision. Stein further stated that as of August 1, all trades needed to be confirmed with the league office by all involved parties before they would be considered consummated. Lindros signed a five-year contract with the Flyers worth an estimated $24million. As a rookie, he earned $2million, while Gretzky, with the largest NHL contract, earned $3million. Lindros did not accompany the Flyers to Quebec for an exhibition game prior to the 1992–93 season due to concern about the reception he would receive. Hextall and Ricci initially {{did not want to}} report to Quebec, but relented.|$|E
5|$|On 28 January 2014, the DA {{announced}} that Mamphela Ramphele had accepted {{an invitation to}} stand as its presidential candidate in the 2014 general election, and the DA and Agang South Africa were set to merge. On the 31st, Ramphele stated that she <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> up DA party membership and would remain the leader of Agang South Africa, resulting in confusion. On 2 February, Helen Zille stated that Ramphele had reneged on her agreement to stand as the DA's presidential candidate. Ramphele subsequently apologised for the reversal of her decision, saying that the timing was not right as the reaction to it had shown people were unable to overcome race-based party politics.|$|E

5|$|The Civil Partnership Act {{came into}} effect on 1 January 2011. It had been {{expected}} that the first ceremonies <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> place until April 2011 due to a three-month waiting period required by law for all civil ceremonies. However, the legislation does provide a mechanism for exemptions to be sought through the courts, and the first partnership, which was between two men, was registered on 7 February 2011. While this ceremony was carried out publicly in the Civil Registration Office in Dublin, the mainstream media were not present.|$|E
5|$|The South Vietnamese M113s had {{no problem}} {{crossing}} the generally shallow streams and rivers typical of the Mekong Delta, but the heavy 10-ton M113s became bogged down in the deeper Cong Ba Ky Canal, forcing the crews and the infantry company on board to cut down brush and trees and fill the canal until it was shallow enough for the M113s to cross. The rescue operation was further delayed when Ba tried to obtain proper authorization to advance, because he was under orders not to take commands directly from the American advisers. Vann, who was flying above the armored formation, demanded that Ba advance immediately. Ba replied that he <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> instructions from Americans. When Vann threatened to have Ba shot, he reluctantly continued to advance, although very slowly, toward the entrenched Viet Cong.|$|E
5|$|Though wrestling bouts {{had been}} held {{as early as the}} 1860s, modern {{professional}} wrestling <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> shape until {{around the turn of the}} 20th century. Georg Hackenschmidt toured the country performing against local wrestlers in exhibition bouts in 1905 and 1910. In 1919, Gisborne Katene defeated Frank Findlay for the NWA New Zealand Heavyweight Championship, though it became vacant shortly afterwards. The first officially recognized champion was Maori wrestler Ike Robin who won the title in Auckland on 17 March 1925, and held it until his retirement the following year; the title continued to be defended for almost 70 years.|$|E

5|$|A four-lane {{bridge is}} {{estimated}} to cost NOK2 billion. It could either be located immediately north of the current bridge, or south of Norwegian Talc. The traffic from Askøy, along County Road 562, connects with National Road 555 at Storavatnet. Without a bypass, the increased capacity from Sotra would not be achieved without expanding the motorway from Storavatnet to the city center. In 2010, an alternative was launched whereby a four-lane bridge would be built south of Norwegian Talc, and would immediately run into a tunnel and connect to the current motorway at Liavatnet. This is the planned intersection between National Road 555 and County Road 557 (Ring Road West), which would result in traffic from Sotra towards southern Bergen <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> up capacity on the current 555 motorway until after traffic from both Sotra and Askøy heading towards southern Bergen have had a possibility to head onto County Road 557.|$|E
5|$|After the {{manifesto}} was published, the FBI received over {{a thousand}} calls a day for months {{in response to the}} offer of a $1million reward for information leading to the identity of the Unabomber. Many letters claiming to be from the Unabomber were also sent to the UNABOM Task Force, and thousands of suspect leads were reviewed. While the FBI was occupied with new leads, David Kaczynski hired private investigator Susan Swanson in Chicago to investigate Ted's activities discreetly. The Kaczynski brothers had become estranged in 1990, and David had not seen Ted for ten years. David later hired Washington, D.C., attorney Tony Bisceglie to organize evidence acquired by Swanson, and make contact with the FBI, given the likely difficulty in attracting the FBI's attention. He wanted to protect his brother from the danger of an FBI raid, such as the Ruby Ridge or the Waco Siege, since he assumed Ted <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> kindly to being contacted by the FBI and would be likely to react violently.|$|E
5|$|At 13:29 {{the first}} Ju 87s took off. By 13:45 all were in {{formation}} and beginning the 85-mile trip. Major Helmut Bode led III./StG 77 to Poling. He {{knew nothing of}} the technicalities of his target. Behind him was Hauptmann Alfons Orthofer's II./StG 77 bound for Ford. After them, Hauptmann Herbert Meisel's III Gruppe was heading on {{the left of the}} formation for Thorney Island. Hauptmann Walter Seigel's I./StG 3 headed for Gosport on the extreme left. Each Ju 87 was loaded with 550-lb bombs under the main fuselage and four 11-lb bombs and two under each wing. The Bf 109s <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> off for some time. The long trip and low speed of the Ju 87s meant there was plenty of time to catch up without burning fuel keeping close contact with the Stukas.|$|E
