50|$|The Kitara uses an {{internal}} <b>wavetable</b> <b>synthesizer</b> with effects to generate sound. The Kitara {{is powered by}} an open-sourced Linux based CPU, {{making it possible to}} reprogram the Kitara, modify existing sounds, and program new ones.|$|E
5000|$|WAVE. A <b>wavetable</b> <b>synthesizer.</b> This was a deluxe {{extrapolation}} of Microwave technology, with additional features for wavetable creation and resynthesis that even {{today is not}} available on any other synthesizer. Available in 4 colours. 61 or 76 keys. 16, 32, or 48 voices and expandable to 120. Retail price in 1994 was $9000.00 with less than 200 made. The WAVE was used by for example Depeche Mode, Hans Zimmer and The Orb.|$|E
40|$|Replicating musical {{instruments}} {{is a classic}} problem of computer music. Historically, FM and wavetable synthesis have required trial-and-error optimization of the parameters. Recent work has used evolutionary computation to evolve parameters for synthesizing sounds. Genetic algorithms are particularly efficient and effective at auto-programming FM and <b>wavetable</b> <b>synthesizers</b> to replicate given sounds. This paper surveys FM and wavetable matching techniques {{with an emphasis on}} evolutionary methods...|$|R
5000|$|It {{is often}} {{necessary}} to 'audition' each {{position in a}} wavetable and to scan through it, forwards and backwards, {{in order to make}} good use of it, though selecting random wavetables, start positions, end positions and directions of scan can also produce satisfyingly musical results. It is worth noting that most <b>wavetable</b> <b>synthesizers</b> also employ other synthesis methods to further shape the output waveform, such as subtractive synthesis (filters), phase modulation, frequency modulation and [...] AM (ring) modulation.|$|R
50|$|Many wavetables used in PPG and Ensoniq synthesizers can {{simulate}} {{the methods used}} by analog synthesizers, such as Pulse Width Modulation by utilising a number of square waves of different duty cycles. In this way, when the wavetable is swept, the duty cycle of the pulse wave will appear to change over time.As the early Ensoniq <b>wavetable</b> <b>synthesizers</b> had non resonant filters (the PPG Wave synthesizers used analogue Curtis resonant filters), some wavetables contained highly resonant waveforms to overcome this limitation of the filters.|$|R
50|$|Waldorf Music AG was a German {{synthesizer}} company. Waldorf is {{best known}} for its Microwave <b>wavetable</b> <b>synthesizer</b> and Q virtual analogue synthesizer lines. On 5 February 2004, Waldorf Music AG declared insolvency at a German court. In Summer 2006 a new company Waldorf Music GmbH (GmbH = limited) was formed officially. The new companies' Management board: Joachim Flor (former director of sales), Stefan Stenzel (former director of research and development). The new company is not a legal successor for the old Waldorf company.|$|E
50|$|February 9, 2010 8 Bit Weapon {{released}} the Apple II Digital Music Synthesizer (or D.M.S.). Together Michael J. Mahon and 8 Bit Weapon created the 1st <b>wavetable</b> <b>synthesizer</b> for the Apple //e, IIc, IIc+ and IIGS computers. The software {{is designed for}} live performance {{and it does not}} require a monitor to work. It supports up to 8 voices, which can be selected from the 10 on disk, and played (monophonically) from the Apple II keyboard. It can be used to “record” a performance for later playback as well.|$|E
5000|$|Until {{the early}} 1980s, the tonal palette of {{commercial}} synthesizers {{was limited to}} that which could be obtained by combining a few simple waveforms such as sine, sawtooth, pulse. The result was shaped with VCFs and VCAs. Wolfgang Palm transcended this limitation by pioneering the concept of wavetable synthesis, where single cycle waveforms of differing harmonic spectra were stored in adjacent memory slots. Dynamic spectral shifts were achieved by scanning through the waveforms, with interpolation used to avoid noticeable 'jumps' between the adjacent waveforms.Palm's efforts resulted in PPG's first <b>wavetable</b> <b>synthesizer,</b> the Wavecomputer 360 (1978), which provides the user with 30 different wavetables consisting of 64 waves each. While the expansive range of sound is evident, the absence of filters results in the Wavecomputer 360 sounding buzzy and thin, which hampered its original commercial viability. [...] Palm's efforts to resolve the apparent shortcomings of the Wavecomputer 360 {{would result in the}} creation of PPG's Wave series of synthesizers.|$|E
50|$|Palm {{is arguably}} most {{famous for the}} {{invention}} of wavetable synthesis, a concept which he developed in the late 1970s when he created his Minimoog-like synthesizer - the 1020 - featuring digitally controlled oscillators instead of the voltage controlled oscillators that his 1002 synthesizer and all other analog synthesizers of that time were using. He also created the 360 Wavecomputer that would later become the renowned PPG Wave series. Palm's design was {{the impetus for the}} creation of the highly successful PPG Wave synthesizer, which was used by numerous bands throughout the 1980s and beyond. The sounds in the PPG Wave inspired other manufacturers of digital synthesizers, such as Sequential Circuits and Ensoniq. Today, nearly every digital synthesizer is in some way based on the concept of <b>wavetable</b> <b>synthesizers.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2003, QSound added a {{software}} MIDI <b>wavetable</b> ringtone <b>synthesizer</b> to its line-up. The effects suite and synthesizer are licensed {{in the form}} of software libraries to mobile phone manufacturers and providers of related technology (e.g. DSP's and DSP operating systems), in order to provide polyphonic ringtone rendering and enhanced music or mobile TV playback on hand-held devices.|$|R
50|$|In 1986 it was ported to the Apple IIGS {{where it}} {{made use of}} its {{built-in}} Ensoniq <b>wavetable</b> sample-based <b>synthesizer.</b> The port was done by Randel B. Reiss; it was never released, but its music engine was used for producing the soundtrack for the Apple IIGS game titles Zany Golf and The Immortal, {{both of which were}} written by Will Harvey.|$|R
5000|$|The {{company was}} {{a pioneer in the}} field of {{computer}} music, introducing the pre-MIDI SoundChaser in 1982. This Apple II-based system included the Mountain Computer Music System, a programmable 8-voice <b>wavetable</b> <b>synthesizer</b> that fit in two Apple II slots, the Soundchaser 4-octave keyboard, and system software, written by Kusek, that emulated a four-track tape recorder. After Mountain Computer discontinued the Mountain Computer Music System, Passport developed the Soundchaser MX-5(MX-500) Card to use instead. The MX-5 contains not only Mountain Computer Music System compatible sound function but also MIDI interface and keyboard interface of Sound Chaser Music keyboard in single card. In 1983, composer John Melcher developed 4-Track Editor, a composing application that enabled music to be entered like a word-processor. The same year, Passport released Turbo-Traks, a 16-track version of their recording software. At this time, they also released Notewriter, a [...] "real-time monophonic music transcriber", and Notetools, an add-on to convert Notewriter files to 4-Track Performance files. They also released a series of educational applications, written by Dr. Charles Brody.|$|E
50|$|Support for WDM audio enables digital mixing, routing and {{processing}} of simultaneous audio streams and kernel streaming with high quality sample rate conversion on Windows 98. WDM Audio allows for software emulation of legacy hardware to support MS-DOS games, DirectSound support and MIDI wavetable synthesis. The Windows 95 11-device limitation for MIDI devices is eliminated. A Microsoft GS <b>Wavetable</b> <b>Synthesizer</b> licensed from Roland shipped with Windows 98 for WDM audio drivers. Windows 98 supports digital playback of audio CDs, and the Second Edition improves WDM audio support by adding DirectSound hardware mixing and DirectSound 3D hardware abstraction, DirectMusic kernel support, KMixer sample-rate conversion (SRC) for capture streams and multichannel audio support. All audio is sampled by the Kernel Mixer to a fixed sampling rate which {{may result in}} some audio getting upsampled or downsampled and having a high latency, except when using Kernel Streaming or third-party audio paths like ASIO which allow unmixed audio streams and lower latency. Windows 98 also includes a WDM streaming class driver (Stream.sys) to address real time multimedia data stream processing requirements and a WDM kernel-mode video transport for enhanced video playback and capture.|$|E
40|$|Consumers and {{professional}} audio content developers continue to demand more powerful audio {{systems in the}} virtual worlds of games. These needs led our company to produce the EMU 10 K 1 digital audio processor, which places both a high-quality music synthesizer and a powerful audio effects processor on the same die. Implemented in a 0. 35 -micron, three-metallayer CMOS process, the processor resides on a 6. 7 -mm × 6. 5 -mm die containing 2, 439, 711 transistors, a 33 -MHz PCI clock, and 50 -MHz and 100 -MHz internal audio clocks. It has a 64 -channel <b>wavetable</b> <b>synthesizer</b> with perchannel sample rate converter, digital filter...|$|E
50|$|Massive is a {{commercial}} <b>wavetable</b> software <b>synthesizer</b> plugin manufactured by Native Instruments {{for use in}} professional audio production. It utilizes several wavetables and oscillators {{in the creation of}} synthetic timbres. The software {{can be used as a}} VST plugin within a digital audio workstation, or as a standalone program. Released in 2007, the plugin has gained widespread popularity in the electronic music field, and is one of the most popular synthesizer plugins for modern dance music production.|$|R
5000|$|Microwave I V2.0 ROM upgrade, which added {{additional}} wavetables, {{a facility}} to algorithmically create custom <b>wavetables,</b> a speech <b>synthesizer,</b> {{and numerous other}} improvements. The Waveslave was not compatible with this upgrade, but a trade-in program was offered where the user could upgrade to a full Microwave for a small fee.|$|R
50|$|In 1998, Creative {{acquired}} Ensoniq Corporation, {{manufacturer of}} the AudioPCI, a card popular with OEMs at the time. It was a full-featured solution with <b>wavetable</b> MIDI (sample-based <b>synthesizer),</b> 4-speaker DirectSound3D surround sound, A3D emulation and full DOS legacy support. It was cheap {{due to lack}} of hardware acceleration. It is full-duplex but at least in MS Windows cannot play back several sources at once.|$|R
50|$|The {{creation}} of new wavetables was previously a difficult process unless supported by specialized editing facilities and (near) real-time playback of edited <b>wavetables</b> on the <b>synthesizer.</b> Such editors often required the use of extra hardware devices like the PPG Waveterm or were only present in expensive models like the Waldorf WAVE. More commonly, pre-computed wavetables could be added via memory cards or sent to the synthesizer via MIDI. Today, wavetables can be created more easily by software and auditioned directly on a computer. Since all waveforms used in wavetable synthesis are periodic, the time-domain and frequency-domain representation are exact equivalents {{of each other and}} both can be used simultaneously to define waveforms and wavetables.|$|R
