5|$|As {{with most}} of Virginia, Newport News is most often {{associated}} with the larger American South. People who {{have grown up in}} the Hampton Roads area have a unique Tidewater accent <b>which</b> <b>sounds</b> different from a stereotypical Southern accent. Vowels have a longer pronunciation than in a typical southern accent.|$|E
5|$|The music kizomba from Angola and cabo-love from Cape Verde {{are also}} {{derivatives}} of this French Antillean compas music style, <b>which</b> <b>sounds</b> basically the same, {{although there are}} notable differences once you become more familiar with these genres. A main exponent of this subgenre is Ophelia Marie. Other Zouk Love artists come from the French West Indies, the Netherlands, and Africa.|$|E
5|$|A 2008 paper saw {{a return}} to white-eye {{taxonomy}} with the formal description of the Togian white-eye Zosterops somadikartai, an endemic species of the Togian Islands of Indonesia, which, unlike most of its relatives, lacks the white ring around the eye which give this group of birds its name. Rasmussen noted that the Togian white-eye is distinctive not only in its appearance, but also in its lilting song, <b>which</b> <b>sounds</b> higher pitched and is less varied in frequency than the songs of its close relatives.|$|E

5|$|The {{black stork}} has {{a wider range}} of calls than the white stork, its main call being a chee leee, <b>which</b> <b>sounds</b> like a loud inhalation. It makes a hissing call as a warning or threat. Displaying males produce a long series of wheezy raptor-like {{squealing}} calls rising in volume and then falling. It rarely indulges in mutual bill-clattering when adults meet at the nest. Adults will do so as part of their mating ritual or when angered. The young clatter their bills when aroused.|$|E
5|$|The most {{distinctive}} {{voice of the}} curve-billed is an abrupt and brash whit-wheet, <b>which</b> <b>sounds</b> akin to a person whistling to get one's attention. It is usually uttered from high perches. The songs are {{similar to that of}} the northern mockingbird but notes do not end as abruptly; its voice is regarded as more pleasant. The curve-billed can utter songs consecutively two or three times, the length spanning from 2 to 15 seconds. Some phrases are nasal and buzzy; its large vocabulary enables it to conjure successive songs that are usually different from one another.|$|E
5|$|Although the IPA offers over 160 symbols for transcribing speech, only a {{relatively}} small subset of these {{will be used to}} transcribe any one language. It is possible to transcribe speech with various levels of precision. A precise phonetic transcription, in <b>which</b> <b>sounds</b> are described in a great deal of detail, is known as a narrow transcription. A coarser transcription which ignores some of this detail is called a broad transcription. Both are relative terms, and both are generally enclosed in square brackets. Broad phonetic transcriptions may restrict themselves to easily heard details, or only to details that are relevant to the discussion at hand, and may differ little if at all from phonemic transcriptions, but they make no theoretical claim that all the distinctions transcribed are necessarily meaningful in the language.|$|E

5|$|We were in {{a studio}} in New York, this place called the Magic Shop, and it had this thing called a tack piano there, <b>which</b> <b>sounds</b> like an old honky-tonk piano, where you put little tacks in the hammers, so it sounds like more of a {{harpsichord}} almost. And {{so we wanted to}} use that kind of sound, but we didn't have a tack piano, so rather than sample it, we went and bought an old piano from the shop up the road from our studio, and we bought a load of tacks, and me and Guy and Jon spent a couple of hours pushing tacks into the piano hammers.|$|E

25|$|The Swedish {{tradition}} dates {{at least}} to the 15th century, and there is even a particular day for the purpose, Våffeldagen (waffle day), <b>which</b> <b>sounds</b> like Vårfrudagen ("Our Lady's Day"), and is therefore used for the purpose. This is March 25 (nine months before Christmas), the Christian holiday of Annunciation. They are usually topped with strawberry jam, bilberry jam, hjortron jam, raspberry jam, bilberry and raspberry jam, sugar and butter, vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. Other, savory, toppings include salmon roe, cold-smoked salmon and cream fraiche.|$|E
25|$|Pytheas {{crossed the}} waters northward from Berrice, {{in the north}} of the British Isles, but whether to starboard, larboard, or {{straight}} ahead is not known. From the time of the Roman Empire all the possibilities were suggested repeatedly by each generation of writers: Iceland, Shetland, the Faroe Islands, Norway and later Greenland. A manuscript variant of a name in Pliny has abetted the Iceland theory: Nerigon instead of Berrice, <b>which</b> <b>sounds</b> like Norway. If one sails west from Norway one encounters Iceland. Burton himself espoused this theory.|$|E
25|$|Australia and its territories {{are home}} to around 800 species of bird; about 350 of these are endemic to the zoogeographic region that covers Australia, New Guinea and New Zealand. The fossil record of birds in Australia is patchy; however, there are records of the {{ancestors}} of contemporary species {{as early as the}} Late Oligocene. Birds with a Gondwanan history include the flightless ratites (the emu and southern cassowary), megapodes (the malleefowl and Australian brush-turkey), and a huge group of endemic parrots, order Psittaciformes. Australian parrots comprise a sixth of the world's parrots, including many cockatoos and galahs. The kookaburra is the largest species of the kingfisher family, known for its call, <b>which</b> <b>sounds</b> uncannily like loud, echoing human laughter.|$|E

25|$|The clearest {{and most}} {{important}} example of Prague school structuralism lies in phonemics. Rather than simply compiling a list of <b>which</b> <b>sounds</b> occur in a language, the Prague school sought to examine how they were related. They determined that the inventory of sounds in a language could be analysed {{in terms of a}} series of contrasts. Thus in English the sounds /p/ and /b/ represent distinct phonemes because there are cases (minimal pairs) where the contrast between the two is the only difference between two distinct words (e.g. 'pat' and 'bat'). Analyzing sounds in terms of contrastive features also opens up comparative scope—it makes clear, for instance, that the difficulty Japanese speakers have differentiating /r/ and /l/ in English is because these sounds are not contrastive in Japanese. Phonology would become the paradigmatic basis for structuralism {{in a number of different}} fields.|$|E

In the same way as Kungfusão, the Italian and Spanish titles were Kung-fusion and Kung-fusión, puns of [...] "confusion". In France, the film is known as Crazy Kung Fu, and the Hungarian title is A Pofonok Földje, meaning The Land of Punches.|$|E
