5|$|Klaus Dodds {{has noted}} {{that there is a}} geopolitical aspect to the {{locations}} used, although this is often a pre-emption of an issue by the film. For example, in the first film, Dr. No, the title villain's disruption of the American Project Mercury space launch from Cape Canaveral with his atomic-powered radio beam mirrored claims that American rocket testing at Cape Canaveral had problems with rockets going astray. Similarly Bond's anti-heroin mission in Live and Let Die coincided with President Nixon's 1972 declaration of a <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Drugs,</b> whilst GoldenEye played against the backdrop of Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.|$|E
5|$|Levy-Pounds began {{teaching}} law {{as an associate}} professor at the University of St. Thomas (UST) in Minneapolis in 2003. In her research, she has focused on the <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Drugs,</b> incarceration, mandatory sentencing, and sentencing guidelines, primarily as they affect women and children of color, but also young black men. In 2006, Levy-Pounds founded the Community Justice Project (CJP), a partnership between UST's School of Law and the Saint Paul chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). The CJP allows law students interested in working with underserved communities to gain experience through academic writing, fora, and interaction with local governments and communities.|$|E
50|$|On December 1, 2006, President Felipe Calderón assumed {{office and}} {{declared}} <b>war</b> <b>on</b> <b>drug</b> traffickers. Troops and Federal Police forces {{were ordered to}} move into hot zones where drug cartels operated—especially in Michoacán, Tamaulipas, and Ciudad Juárez. Calderón also imposed a cap on salaries of high-ranking public servants and ordered a raise on the salaries of the Federal Police and federal armed forces. Since early 2007, 2,500 Mexican troops {{have been sent to}} Juárez to combat organized crime.|$|R

5|$|The Civil Air Patrol also {{provides}} non-emergency {{assistance to the}} U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Drug Enforcement Administration, and United States Forest Service in the <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Drugs.</b> In 2005, CAP flew over 12,000hours {{in support of this}} mission and led these agencies to the confiscation of illegal substances valued at over US$400million. Civil Air Patrol makes extensive use of the Airborne Real-time Cueing Hyperspectral Enhanced Reconnaissance system, mounted on the Gippsland GA8 Airvan. The system is able to evaluate spectral signatures given off by certain objects, allowing the system to identify, for example, a possible marijuana crop.|$|E
5|$|Born to an Aymara {{family of}} {{subsistence}} farmers in Isallawi, Orinoca Canton, Morales undertook a basic education before mandatory military service, in 1978 moving to Chapare Province. Growing coca {{and becoming a}} trade unionist, he rose to prominence in the campesino ("rural laborers") union. In that capacity he campaigned against U.S. and Bolivian attempts to eradicate coca {{as part of the}} <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Drugs,</b> denouncing these as an imperialist violation of indigenous Andean culture. His involvement in anti-government direct action protests resulted in multiple arrests. Morales entered electoral politics in 1995, became the leader of the MAS and was elected to Congress. His campaign focused on issues affecting indigenous and poor communities, advocating land reform and the redistribution of gas wealth. He gained increased visibility through the Cochabamba protests and gas conflict. In 2002 he was expelled from Congress for encouraging protesters, although he came second in that year's presidential election.|$|E

Robert's daughter, Caroline (Christensen), an honors student, has been using cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin which quickly develops into a drug addiction after her boyfriend Seth (Grace) introduces her to freebasing. Caroline, Seth, and Vanessa are all arrested when a fellow student overdoses on drugs, and they try to dump him anonymously at a hospital. As Robert and his wife Barbara (Irving) struggle {{to deal with the}} problem, Robert discovers that Barbara has known about their daughter's involvement with drugs for over six months.|$|E

Spanning two volumes of approximately 450 articles in an A-to-Z format, the encyclopedia explores this controversial war {{through the lens}} of varied disciplines, and a full spectrum of articles explains topics from Colombian cartels and Mexican kingpins to television reportage; from “just say no” advertising to heroin production; from narco-terrorism to over $ 500 billion in United States government expenditure. These articles, along with a range of pedagogical elements and availablity in both print and electronic formats combine to comprise an outstanding reference source...|$|R

5000|$|The {{inequity}} of prosecuting the <b>war</b> <b>on</b> certain <b>drugs</b> but not {{alcohol or}} tobacco {{has also been}} called into question.

5|$|Born in Panama City to a poor mestizo family, Noriega {{studied at}} the Chorrillos Military School in Lima and at the School of the Americas. He became {{an officer in the}} Panamanian army, and rose through the ranks in {{alliance}} with Omar Torrijos. In 1968, Torrijos overthrew President Arnulfo Arias in a coup, establishing himself as leader; under Torrijos' government, Noriega became chief of military intelligence. After Torrijos' death in 1981, Noriega consolidated his power to become Panama's de facto ruler in 1983. From the 1950s until shortly before the U.S. invasion, Noriega worked with U.S. intelligence agencies. Noriega was one of the Central Intelligence Agency's most valued intelligence sources, as well as one of the primary conduits for illicit weapons, military equipment and cash destined for U.S.-backed counter-insurgency forces throughout Latin America. The U.S. also regarded Noriega as an ally in its <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Drugs,</b> despite Noriega himself having amassed a personal fortune through drug trafficking operations. Though his U.S. intelligence handlers were aware of this, it was allowed because of his usefulness to the U.S.|$|E

40|$|México’s current {{humanitarian}} crisis has been exacerbated by {{almost a decade}} of ineffective anti-cartel and US-México security policies, which have resulted in unprecedented murder rates and remade power relations among political elite, drug cartels, and local communities.

40|$|The authors {{argue that}} since the 1980 s UK drug policy has largely been ill considered, {{reactive}} and counter- productive. Rather than reducing drug taking and drug related crime, such policies have exacerbated the problem and contributed towards {{an environment in which}} drug use and illegal drug activities are likely to flourish. One of the consequences of this 'war on drugs' is that it manifests itself as a 'war <b>on</b> <b>drug</b> users' with an emphasis not upon the development of appropriate rehabilitative models, but upon prevention, prohibition and punishment. Drawing on the authors' qualitative research on Merseyside, England involving 200 problem drug users, it will be argued that the <b>war</b> <b>on</b> <b>drug</b> users has subjected these people to a process of stigmatization, marginalization and social exclusion, and prevented many of them from recovery by hindering their re-integation into the wider social and economic community. Instead, growing numbers of problematic drug users remain locked into a cycle of chronic drug relapse...|$|R

5000|$|The Our America Initiative is a 501(c)(4) {{political}} advocacy committee {{formed by}} Gary Johnson, the former Republican politician {{who served as}} the 29th Governor of New Mexico from 1995 to 2003.

25|$|From {{the autumn}} of 1979, the LaRouche {{movement}} conducted most of its U.S. electoral activities as the National Democratic Policy Committee (NDPC), a political action committee.

His campaign platforms included {{a return to the}} Bretton Woods system, including a gold-based national and world monetary system; fixed exchange rates; and ending the IMF. He supported the replacement of the central bank system, including the U.S. Federal Reserve System, with a national bank; a <b>war</b> <b>on</b> <b>drug</b> trafficking and prosecution of banks involved in money laundering; building a tunnel under the Bering Strait; the building of nuclear power plants; and a crash program to build particle beam weapons and lasers, including support for elements of the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI).
