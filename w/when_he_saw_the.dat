5|$|Harwood said {{he first}} {{realized}} on 8 April, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> Guardian video, that Tomlinson had died. He reportedly collapsed {{at home and}} had to be taken to hospital by ambulance. Harwood and three colleagues made themselves known to the IPCC that day.|$|E
5|$|Owner Bill Veeck was {{concerned}} the promotion might {{turn into a}} disaster and checked {{himself out of the}} hospital, where he had been undergoing tests. The elder Veeck's fears were substantiated <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> people walking towards the ballpark that afternoon; many carried signs that described disco in profane terms.|$|E
5|$|Additions {{to the end}} musical number, {{including}} visual gags such as Bob {{appearing in}} uniform, were added after the animatics. The crew felt that watching the character singing would not be interesting enough {{and they had to}} include these gags to make it work. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening was surprised <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> additions, because he originally thought they were silly and would not appear in the final cut, but he has grown to like them.|$|E
60|$|Harold said {{nearly the}} same thing to Wulf <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> him <b>the</b> next morning.|$|R
60|$|Another day, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> Miriam, <b>the</b> {{conversation}} {{turned to}} marriage, then to Clara's marriage with Dawes.|$|R

5|$|Franklin {{was first}} {{attracted}} {{to the study of}} electricity <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> showman Archibald Spencer do magic demonstrations in Boston (1743) and in Philadelphia (1744). He purchased Spencer's equipment and used it for his electricity experiments after these demonstrations were completed. He referred to Spencer as Dr. Spence from Scotland. In 1746, at the age of forty years, Franklin began turning over the affairs of his printing company to his business partner David Hall, and went into semi-retirement so he could carry out research on electricity; initially using Spencer's equipment.|$|E
5|$|D'Eyncourt {{probably}} avoided proposing any {{design with}} 16-inch guns <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> political situation. In meetings with Leão, designs of only ten 12-inch guns {{mounted on the}} centerline were quickly rejected, even though their broadside was as strong {{as that of the}} Minas Geraes class, but a design with no less than fourteen 12-inch guns emerged as the frontrunner. Author David Topliss attributes this to political necessity, as he believed the Minister of the Navy could not validate purchasing a seemingly less-powerful dreadnought than the Minas Geraes class: with larger guns ruled out, the only remaining choice was a larger number of guns.|$|E
5|$|Team Canada took {{a number}} of {{questionable}} early penalties. With two Canadians (White and Peter Mahovlich) off, Yakushev scored to give the Soviets the lead 1–0. The game was delayed after a mistaken call against J. P. Parise, (he was called for interference, but Parise admitted later he was guilty of cross-checking) and emotions boiled over. Parise was called for a misconduct for banging his stick on the ice, and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> misconduct called, he dashed across the ice with his stick raised. Parise nearly swung his stick at Kompalla and got a match penalty. Sinden threw a chair on the ice. Some writers have commented that the incidents resulted {{in the rest of}} the game being refereed capably.|$|E

60|$|Ludlow seemed relieved, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw,</b> by <b>the</b> undisguised amazement of his companion, {{that the}} latter was, in truth, ignorant of the matter in which lie had been detained.|$|R
5|$|The {{music for}} Nocturne was {{composed}} by Shoji Meguro, with additional work by Kenichi Tsuchiya and Toshiko Tasaki. Mixing {{was done by}} Meguro, Tsuchiya, and Tasaki. The soundtrack included tunes from previous Shin Megami Tensei titles composed by Tsukasa Masuko. While composing the music, Meguro attempted to express his feelings <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> world while remaining true to the styles established by the original Megami Tensei games. Taking inspiration from the game's dungeon-battle transitions, and the cut-scenes' combination of current graphics with classic use of subtitles for storytelling, Meguro created modulating tunes which included elements from 1980s music. Meguro also introduced orchestral elements which were absent from previous Megami Tensei scores, using it to emphasize the gameplay's constant shifts between movement and stillness. Meguro generally worked solo on the original version, but for the director's cut, he had help composing new tracks.|$|E
5|$|Forgotten {{for nearly}} 13 years, the Changi Murals were accidentally rediscovered in 1958 by {{servicemen}} of the Royal Air Force (RAF) occupying the Roberts Barracks. The Chapel was again {{used as a}} store, and later as accommodation by the RAF. Once rediscovered, the distemper coating covering the murals was carefully removed – four complete murals and the top-quarter of a fifth were revealed. As there was no signature {{on any of the}} murals, a search for the artist was undertaken but failed after initial investigations. By a stroke of luck, the artist's name came to light in the RAF Changi Education Library of all places. A reader came across a book titled The Churches of the Captivity in Malaya, mentioning about the Chapel of St Luke in Roberts Barracks and the artist's name – Bombardier Stanley Warren. The Daily Mirror was notified and again went to work looking for the known artist. In February 1959, he was found living in London with his wife and son. He was shocked <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> photo of his mural of the Crucifixion, when a keen-eyed colleague of his showed him the papers.|$|E
5|$|Pottier {{also won}} the fourth stage. In the fifth stage, he was leading by one hour at the halfway point. A cycling legend says {{that he decided to}} stop, entered a bar and ordered a bottle of wine, and drank it almost completely. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> first other cyclists passing by, Pottier mounted his bicycle again, went after them, and won the stage. By this point, Pottier was leading the overall {{classification}} firmly. The winner of the 1905 Tour de France, Louis Trousselier, had had a bad first half of the Tour, and was many points behind. Trousselier rediscovered his form {{in the second half of}} the race, won the 7th, 9th, 10th and 11th stages, and was challenging the second place of Georges Passerieu. Passerieu defended his position by winning the 12th stage. In the last stage, Pottier showed his strength by winning the stage, after finishing together in Paris with Passerieu.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{had no idea}} then {{of being}} untrue to you. But <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> her, <b>the</b> old {{intimacy}} came back. That was natural. Thea he was dazzled by her beauty." ...|$|R

5|$|The sailor {{offers to}} pay a reward, but Dupin is {{interested}} only in learning the circumstances behind the two murders. The sailor explains that he captured the orangutan while in Borneo and brought it back to Paris, but had trouble keeping it under control. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> orangutan attempting to shave its face with his straight razor, imitating his morning grooming, it fled into the streets and reached the Rue Morgue, where it climbed up and into the house. The orangutan seized the mother by the hair and was waving the razor, imitating a barber; when she screamed in fear, it flew into a rage, ripped her hair out, slashed her throat, and strangled the daughter. The sailor climbed up the lightning rod {{in an attempt to}} catch the animal, and the two voices heard by witnesses belonged to it and to him. Fearing punishment by its master, the orangutan threw the mother's body out the window and stuffed the daughter into the chimney before fleeing.|$|E
5|$|When he auditioned, Hertzberg had no {{idea what}} Adam would look like in full costume and make-up. Buffy used a company named Optic Nerve to build the {{materials}} to make Hertzberg look like a demonoid. Almost immediately after Hertzberg got the part, Optic Nerve sketched and sculpted Adam's appearance. They had Hertzberg come in to have molds made for prosthetic parts to fit his head and face, arms, chest, and legs, then he was fitted for contact lenses. They also created separate hands and a chest to film for close-up shots. Adam has a floppy disk drive mounted on his chest which, when used, had to be filmed without Hertzberg behind it. The entire construction of Adam's appearance took about two weeks. Hertzberg's voice was also modified post-production. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> full Adam prosthetic and costume, his biggest concern was being able to show nuanced facial expressions under so much latex. It took hours to get Hertzberg into his full costume, but even after it was fully applied on set, often he would have to wait even longer before he went in front of the cameras. He spoke of the need to stay focused during all the waiting while sweating underneath everything he wore for the part.|$|E
5|$|While {{he was in}} Paris at the Jardin des Plantes, Gray saw {{an unnamed}} dried specimen, {{collected}} by André Michaux, and named it Shortia galacifolia. He spent considerable time and effort over the next 38 years looking for a specimen in the wild. The first such expedition was in late June to late July 1841 to an area near Jefferson, Ashe County, North Carolina. His further expeditions searching for this species were also unsuccessful, including one in 1876. In May 1877 a North Carolina herb collector found a specimen but {{did not know what}} it was. Eighteen months later the collector sent it to Joseph Whipple Congdon, who contacted Gray, telling Gray that he felt he had found Shortia. Gray was ecstatic to confirm this <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> specimen in October 1878. In spring 1879 Gray led an expedition, in which the collector helped, to the spot where S.galacifolia had been found. Gray never saw the species in the wild in bloom, but made a final trip to this region in 1884.|$|E
6000|$|As {{they began}} stating their grievances, Ned as usual warned {{them off with}} a brief [...] "to-morrow" [...] <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> outside <b>the</b> group of Hindoos two or three Mussulman troopers.|$|R
6000|$|At last <b>he</b> stopped suddenly, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>the</b> animal {{excitement}} was at {{the very}} highest; and called on all who felt [...] "convinced" [...] {{to come forward and}} confess their sins.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lady Sad-Eyes," [...] whispered Hans, [...] "and her bride-women. Doubtless {{that old}} Predikant came {{to kill her}} <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>the</b> battle was lost, but the bride-women killed him with their knives." ...|$|R
5|$|Even {{after the}} {{imperial}} fleet reached the island, Andronikos III offered to let Martino keep his possessions {{in exchange for}} the installation of a Byzantine garrison and the payment of an annual tribute, but Martino refused. He sank his three galleys in the harbour, forbade the Greek population to bear arms and locked himself with 800 men in his citadel, where he raised his own banner instead of the emperor's. His will to resist was broken, however, when Benedetto surrendered his own fort to the Byzantines, and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> locals welcoming them, he was soon forced to surrender. The emperor spared his life, even though the Chians demanded his execution, and took him prisoner to Constantinople. Martino's wife and relatives were allowed to go free with their movable wealth, while most of the Zaccaria adherents chose to stay on the island as imperial officials. Benedetto was offered the island's governorship, but he obstinately demanded to receive it as a personal possession {{in the same way as}} his brother had held it, a concession the emperor was unwilling to grant. Benedetto retired to the Genoese colony of Galata, from where a few years later he made an unsuccessful attempt to reclaim Chios; he died soon after. Andronikos III appointed Kalothetos as the new governor of Chios, and followed up his success by sailing to Phocaea, forcing it to acknowledge his suzerainty.|$|E
5|$|Following Cortés' visit, no Spanish {{attempted}} {{to visit the}} warlike Itza inhabitants of Nojpetén for almost a hundred years. In 1618 two Franciscan friars set out from Mérida in Yucatán {{on a mission to}} attempt the peaceful conversion of the still pagan Itza in central Petén. Bartolomé de Fuensalida and Juan de Orbita were accompanied by some Christianised Maya. Andrés Carrillo de Pernía, a Criollo who was the alcalde of Bacalar (a colonial official), joined the party at Bacalar and escorted them upriver as far as Tipuj, returning to Bacalar once he was certain of the friars receiving a good welcome there. After an arduous six-month journey the travellers were well received by the current Kan Ek'. They stayed at Nojpetén for some days in an attempt to evangelise the Itza, but the Aj Kan Ek' refused to renounce his Maya religion, although he showed interest in the masses held by the Catholic missionaries. Kan Ek' informed them that according to ancient Itza prophecy it was not yet time for them to convert. In the time since Cortés had visited Nojpetén, the Itza had made a statue of the deified horse. Juan de Orbita was outraged <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> idol and he immediately smashed it into pieces. Fuensalida was able to save the lives of the visitors from the infuriated natives by means of a particularly eloquent sermon that resulted in them being forgiven. Attempts to convert the Itza failed, and the friars left Nojpetén on friendly terms with Kan Ek'.|$|E

50|$|Oudry used {{a camera}} obscura {{in an attempt}} to speed up the process of {{producing}} landscapes, but abandoned it <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>the</b> perspective and the effects of light and shade did not appear correct.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Finch himself {{came out}} to receive us, with a lamp in his hand. He lifted his eyes (and his lamp) devotionally to <b>the</b> sky <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> Oscar. <b>The</b> two first words he said, were:-- ...|$|R

25|$|Despite their {{practice}} staged-robbery the previous day, as the Katy No. 2 approached, Reed threw the switch too early. Engineer Joseph Hotchkiss stopped the train <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> signal light change, {{far short of}} the siding. Reed and the others were forced to run towards the train yelling and shooting. Hotchkiss and the fireman alerted the messengers using the bell cord connected to the car and jumped off the train to hide in a small ravine nearby.|$|E
25|$|Chekhov {{originally}} intended the {{play as a}} comedy (indeed, the title page of the work refers to it as such), and in letters noted that it is, in places, almost farcical. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> original Moscow Art Theatre production directed by Konstantin Stanislavski, he was horrified {{to find that the}} director had moulded the play into a tragedy. Ever since that time, productions have had to struggle with this dual nature of the play (and of Chekhov's works in general).|$|E
25|$|Dill {{was married}} to Kirk Douglas. The two had met as acting {{students}} before the Second World War. During the war, Douglas was serving in the U.S. Navy <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> May 3, 1943, issue of Life magazine, which featured a photograph of Dill on the cover. He showed the cover to his shipmates {{and said that he}} would marry her. The two were married on November 2, 1943. They had two sons, Michael and Joel, before divorcing in 1951.|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah! Here you are!" [...] said Fillmore. He {{had started}} to his feet indignantly {{at the opening of}} the door, like a lion bearded in its den, but calm had {{returned}} <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> who <b>the</b> intruder was.|$|R
