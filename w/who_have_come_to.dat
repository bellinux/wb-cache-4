5|$|During the bell-making, the skomorokh {{from the}} first {{sequence}} makes a reappearance amongst the crowds <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> watch the bell being raised up and he threatens to kill Andrei, whom he mistakes {{for the man who}} denounced him years earlier and therefore led to his arrest, torture and prison sentence. Kirill intervenes on behalf of the silent Andrei and later privately confesses that his sinful envy of Andrei’s talent dissipated once he heard Andrei had abandoned painting and that it was he, Kirill, who had denounced the skomorokh. Kirill then criticises Andrei for allowing his God-given talent for painting to go to waste and pleads with him to resume his artistry, to no response.|$|E

They carry with them the esteem and affection of the townspeople, <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> appreciate their rare qualities. Before her departure, Mrs. Adelina Türr insisted upon visiting the orphanages, where the children greeted her with a most abundant dose of confetti. It was wonderful to see this scion {{of one of the}} greatest and most powerful families of Europe caress and kiss the sons of our labourers, and make the effort of conversing with them in their Pallanzese dialect.|$|E
25|$|The last general {{election}} {{took place in}} 2005 in which the LDP, led by popular prime minister Junichiro Koizumi, received 38.2% of the proportional block votes and 47.8% of the district votes cast (the next largest party, the DPJ, received 31% in the proportional and 36.4% in the district vote). Due to {{the characteristics of the}} Japanese election system, the LDP ended up with 296 seats in the Lower House (61.6%), which enabled Koizumi to complete the privatization of Japan Post. Since then Japan has had three further prime ministers (Shinzō Abe, Yasuo Fukuda and Tarō Asō) <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> power without there being a {{general election}}.|$|E

25|$|Concentrated in San Miguel de Allende {{are foreign}} {{residents}} {{mostly from the}} United States and Canada <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> live because of the area's mild climate, cultural opportunities and low crime. While only about ten percent of San Miguel's total population, {{they have had a}} large impact on the area economically, accounting for most home buyers. Estimates of foreign residents range from 8,000 to 12,000 with about 7,000 of these from the United States alone. This makes San Miguel one of the largest American communities in Mexico, large enough to warrant its own U.S. consulate to provide services such as notary and passport.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the guests}} are three fairies, Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather, <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> bless {{the child with}} gifts. Flora and Fauna give their gifts of beauty and song, respectively. Before Merryweather is able to give her blessing, the evil fairy Maleficent appears, {{only to be told}} that she was not invited. Maleficent turns to leave, but when Queen Leah asks if she's offended, the evil fairy curses the princess, proclaiming that Aurora will grow in grace and beauty, but before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday, she will use her finger to touch the spindle of a {{spinning}} wheel and die. King Stefan and Queen Leah are horrified and beg the fairies to break the curse. Unfortunately, they are not strong enough to break it, but Merryweather uses her blessing to soften the curse so that instead of dying, Aurora will fall into a deep sleep from which she can only be awakened by true love's kiss. King Stefan, still fearful for his daughter's life, orders all spinning wheels in the kingdom to be burned. The fairies do not believe that will be enough to keep Aurora safe, and so they spirit her away to a woodcutter's cottage in the forest until the day of her sixteenth birthday.|$|E

500|$|Pallas and Narcissus {{realize that}} Agrippina has tricked them into {{supporting}} Nero {{and decide to}} have no {{more to do with}} her. Otho arrives, nervous about his forthcoming coronation ("Coronato il crin d'alloro"), followed by Agrippina, Nero and Poppaea, <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> greet Claudius. All combine in a triumphal chorus ("Di timpani e trombe") as Claudius enters. Each in turns pays tribute to the Emperor, but Otho is coldly rebuffed as Claudius denounces him as a traitor. Otho is devastated and appeals to Agrippina, Poppaea, and Nero for support, but they all reject him, leaving him in bewilderment and despair ("Otton, qual portentoso fulmine" [...] followed by [...] "Voi che udite il mio lamento").|$|E

[...] "I think she enjoys not being completely approachable. Just her office is very intimidating. You have to walk about a mile into the office before you get to her desk and I'm sure it's intentional," [...] Coddington says.

500|$|The {{narrative}} {{takes place}} in late December 2004, 100 days after the crash of Oceanic Flight 815. The survivors of the crash team up with the Others, natives of the island where the plane crashed, to confront the mercenaries from the freighter Kahana, <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the island. Following this, some of the survivors escape the island, which is afterwards moved by Ben Linus (Michael Emerson). Flashforwards show the first actions of the Oceanic Six, those who are rescued, after returning home in January 2005, and their lives in late 2007. The cliffhanger from the previous season finale, [...] "Through the Looking Glass," [...] is resolved by revealing John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) to be dead and in the coffin that Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) visits in that episode.|$|E
500|$|Latin was the {{language}} of the Romans from the earliest known period. Writing under the first Roman emperor Augustus, Virgil emphasizes that Latin was a source of Roman unity and tradition. In Virgil's epic Aeneid about the founding of Rome, the supreme deity Jupiter dictates that the refugee Trojans <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> settle in Italy will use {{the language}} of the native Latini as a means of unification: [...] "they will keep the speech (sermo) and mores of their fathers ... and I will make them all [...] Latins with one mode of expression" [...] (uno ore, literally [...] "with one mouth"). The Julio-Claudian emperors, who claimed descent from the Virgilian hero Aeneas, encouraged high standards of correct Latin (Latinitas), a linguistic movement identified in modern terms as Classical Latin, and favored Latin for conducting official business.|$|E
500|$|As in Steading of the Hill Giant Chief, {{the bulk}} of this {{adventure}} takes place in two locations: an upper area consisting of caves and the rift floor, and a lower area consisting of natural caverns. In the upper area there are ice caves, barracks, and a dome of ice. These are inhabited by yeti, frost giants, ogres, and winter wolves. The dome of ice houses a remorhaz. [...] In the lower area there are caverns that house the servants, serve as a prison, and contain the Jarl Grugnur and emissaries <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> meet with him. The main inhabitants are frost giants and ogres. The prison contains an attractive storm giantess. There are also polar bears; pets of the jarl.

500|$|On November 13, the {{campaign}} released a [...] called [...] "Tough on Terror" [...] {{in which a}} hypothetical terrorist attack occurs in a shopping mall. The ad blames inept border security for the attack and flashes images of an injured child and a wrecked train. After Tancredo gives his approval for the message with the comment [...] "I approve this message because someone needs to say it," [...] a voiceover states, [...] "There are consequences to open borders beyond the 20 million aliens <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> take our jobs... the price we pay for spineless politicians who refuse to defend our borders against those who come to kill." [...] Since its release, the ad received criticism from some who called it [...] "cheap" [...] and [...] "blatant fearmongering." [...] Bowdoin College political scientist Michael Franz likened the advertisement to the Daisy ad run by Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1964 Presidential election claiming that the election of Barry Goldwater {{would lead to a}} nuclear war. The other Republican candidates in the race did not comment on the ad.|$|E
500|$|Margaret Beale Spencer and Vinay Harpalani (2008) {{argue that}} {{usage of the}} term [...] "acting white" [...] by black {{teenagers}} does not reflect their cultural values; rather, it is a manifestation of their racial identity development, experienced in conjunction with normal adolescent hassles and peer pressure. [...] Spencer and Harpalani employ William E. Cross's (1991) Nigrescence framework and contend that black teenagers' use of [...] "acting white" [...] in relation to academic achievement is similar to white teenagers' {{use of the term}} [...] "nerd": {{the only difference is that}} black teenagers express it in racialized terms, as in addition to normal teenage peer pressure, they are grappling with racial identity and what it means to be [...] "black". [...] Expressions such as [...] "acting white" [...] may or may not reflect black teenagers' cultural values, and their usage is sometimes counterintuitive: for example, Ogbu (2003) himself documented one instance where a black teenage girl with natural hair was accused of [...] "acting white" [...] by her black peers because [...] "like white people, she did not have to process her hair." [...] These kind of examples show that accusations of [...] "acting white" [...] are not fundamentally about black cultural attributes (although such accusations may reflect these attributes). [...] Rather, [...] "acting white" [...] is just a manifestation of racial identity development for black children and teenagers, who are learning and defining for themselves what it means to be [...] "black"—in conjunction with normal adolescent peer pressure and hassles. That is also why such accusations are less common among black adults, <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> greater resolution regarding racial identity issues.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on August 7, 1987, in United States to 944 theatres. Warner Bros. did not arrange for an advance screening, as they believed that Madonna's appeal would draw moviegoers {{to come to the}} film. A pre-release celebration was held on August 6, 1987, at Times Square in New York, where Madonna arrived to promote the film. A crowd of almost 10,000 people assembled to watch Madonna. As an introduction to the day, the radio jockeys from New York's WHTZ radio station played Madonna's popular songs in the Square, atop a platform created for the event. The police closed off 43rd and 44th streets, but allowing the traffic to pass through Broadway and Seventh Avenue of Manhattan. Around 6 PM, limousines started to arrive at the Square, with celebrities and the actors of the film entering the fanfare. Madonna arrived in a low-cut, low-backed sequined evening gown and the short hair she had adopted for the film. Although she was late by about an hour, the crowd number continued increasing. Asking her fans good-naturedly to [...] "Shut up, so I can talk", Madonna thanked everybody for coming to the opening of Who's That Girl. She talked about her experience of arriving in Times Square eight years before, and said, [...] "I was completely awestruck. Ten years later, I see all of you <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> see me, and I'm completely awestruck. Thank you, and I hope you like the movie." [...] Saying this Madonna departed from the platform, and walked to the National Theatre. Joseph A. Cincotti from The New York Times noted that most of the crowd were in their [...] late teenage years and early 20's. Some held up signs and photographs but he noticed the Madonna wannabes were absent, the adolescent girls who had imitated Madonna's early lace-and-leather look. This was a result of Madonna's more mature image from True Blue.|$|E
