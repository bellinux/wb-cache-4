5|$|On December 15, 2015, Heyward {{signed an}} eight-year, $184 million {{contract}} with the Cubs. One of his first acts after signing his contract was to pay for hotel suites {{large enough to accommodate}} teammate David Ross, his wife, and their three young children on all of the Cubs' road trips during the 2016 season. Ross, set to retire after the 2016 season, had been Heyward's teammate during his first three seasons in Atlanta, and Heyward considered him a key mentor in his early MLB career. In an interview with the Bleacher Report website, Heyward said,I know how special it is to have teammates like he <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> three years in Atlanta. You don't take it for granted. I wanted to say thank you {{from the bottom of my}} heart, as a teammate and as a friend, for what he's done for me.|$|E

I {{had to work with}} a very young child, a dog, and an unprofessional crew except for the cinematographer, who was nagging and complaining all the time. Well, the cinematographer, in a sense, was right because I did not follow the conventions of film making that he had become accustomed to.|$|E

500|$|Coulter's {{music has}} ranged from R and pop, to electro, rock and dance. Guy Blackman of The Age noted that Coulter's self-titled debut album, Ricki-Lee (2005), [...] "is an {{infectious}} collection of R pop tunes {{that takes a}} step beyond the usual Idol fodder". Matthew Chisling of Allmusic {{also noted that the}} album includes elements of rock, and compared the material to artists such as S Club 7 and Nicole Scherzinger. Her second album, Brand New Day (2007), features upbeat dance songs, with elements of disco, reggae, 40s swing music, 70s jazz pop and motown. The lyrics for the album's third single [...] "Can't Sing a Different Song" [...] are [...] "'kind of bragging' about how happy she and her husband" [...] at the time, Babbington, are. In 2009, Coulter released the singles [...] "Don't Miss You" [...] and [...] "Hear No, See No, Speak No", which showcased a new electropop and rock sound. Coulter admitted that [...] "Don't Miss You" [...] was about ending her relationship with Babbington, saying [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> break-up and he <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> boyfriend so I can't lie". Aside from recording music, Coulter has co-written much of her own material. She co-wrote four songs on her debut album, ten songs on her second album, and twelve songs on her third album.|$|E

500|$|Fox {{said that}} while filming her highly {{anticipated}} kissing scene with Seyfried that Seyfried was [...] "extremely uncomfortable" [...] but that she herself was not. [...] "I feel much safer with girls, so I felt more comfortable kissing [...] than kissing {{any of the other}} people that I had to kiss", she said.

It is a woman. With a woman's smell—soft and floraly—and maybe the pheromones are different. Something about it felt uncomfortable for me." ...|$|E
500|$|Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition {{received}} positive reviews. Game Informers Matt Helgeson {{considered the}} updated graphics at native 1080p resolution {{as a good}} addition to the core Tomb Raider experience. He cited mostly negligible {{differences between the two}} versions, but noted a smoother frame-rate on the PS4 version. The Escapist's Jim Sterling was less receptive to the Definitive Edition; he praised the visual improvements, but felt that nominal content additions to the single-player experience and the game's price point made it difficult to recommend to players outside of those who had not played the original version. GameZone's Matt Liebl gave Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition a 9/10, stating [...] "Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> time playing Crystal Dynamics' reboot, so I can definitely recommend it for newcomers. As for whether or not it's worth paying full price for the same game with upgraded graphics, well that's something you need to decide." ...|$|E

500|$|Production advisor Miriam Geiger quickly {{compiled}} a handmade film textbook for Welles, a practical reference book of film techniques that he studied carefully. He then taught himself filmmaking by matching its visual vocabulary to The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, which he ordered from the Museum of Modern Art, and films by Frank Capra, René Clair, Fritz Lang, King Vidor and Jean Renoir. The one film he genuinely studied was John Ford's Stagecoach, which he watched 40 times. [...] "As it turned out, {{the first day}} I ever walked onto a set <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> day as a director," [...] Welles said. [...] "I'd learned whatever I knew in the projection room—from Ford. After dinner every night for about a month, I'd run Stagecoach, often with some different technician or department head from the studio, and ask questions. 'How was this done?' 'Why was this done?' It was like going to school." ...|$|E
500|$|After Troutman's death, Ice Cube {{said that}} [...] "More Bounce To The Ounce" [...] {{introduced}} him to hip-hop. [...] "I was in the sixth grade, we'd stayed after school.

And the way that Europe has developed is that the bankers and the multinational corporations have got very powerful positions, and if you come in on their terms, {{they will tell you}} what you can and cannot do. And that is unacceptable. My view about the European Union has always been not that I am hostile to foreigners, but that I am in favour of democracy ... I think they're building an empire there, they want us {{to be a part of}} their empire and I don't want that.|$|E
