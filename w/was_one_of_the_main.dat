5|$|A {{number of}} special paint {{jobs have been}} carried out. In the mid-1990s, SAS started a scheme to cover MD-80 in single colors {{overlaid}} with small, white aircraft silhouettes, but the project was abandoned after two aircraft. As SAS <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> sponsors of the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, it painted one aircraft in a Lillehammer '94 scheme. Similarly a Copenhagen '96 scheme was pained for Copenhagen's term as the European Capital of Culture. Since 2002, SAS has painted selected aircraft in a Star Alliance livery. With the delivery of the A319 in 2006, one aircraft was delivered in a retro Viking scheme.|$|E

In late June the 3rd Division was reinforced by the US 162nd Regimental Combat Team which staged an amphibious landing to the south of Salamaua.

5|$|Although often {{assumed to}} be a debate of recent origins, local Washington, D.C. {{newspapers}} have published news items on the controversy many times since at least 1971, all in response to Native American individuals or organizations asking for the name to be changed. National protests began in 1988, after the team's Super Bowl XXII victory, prompting numerous Native Americans to write letters to Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke; others boycotted Redskins products and protested, but Cooke rejected the possibility of change. There was a protest of about 2,000 people at the 1992 Super Bowl between the Redskins and the Buffalo Bills; the American Indian Movement's (AIM) Vernon Bellecourt <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> organizers of the protest.|$|E
5|$|During the 17th century, Alsace <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> battlefields of the Thirty Years War. Sélestat {{was seized}} by the Swedes in 1632 after a month-long siege. They {{surrendered}} the town to their French allies two years later. The local population long remained predominantly faithful to the House of Habsburg. The Peace of Westphalia (1648) formalised the annexation of the Decapolis by France. Sélestat was briefly occupied by the Germans during the Franco-Dutch War in 1674. The Treaties of Nijmegen (1679) that ended the war also abolished the Decapolis.|$|E

The couple had two sons: Willie and Oscar Wilde, and a daughter, Isola Francesca, who died in childhood. Another pupil at the school was William Bulfin, the journalist and writer associated with Argentina through his work Tales of the Pampas, who attended in the 1870s. His son, Eamon Bulfin <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> participants in the 1916 Easter Rising in Dublin {{and was sentenced to}} death, but this was commuted to deportation to Argentina where he had been born.|$|E

5|$|Human {{settlement}} in the area dates back to before the Iron Age. The earliest recorded use of the town's name was in the 12th century when the town began to emerge as an important port, prospering {{with the introduction of}} the wool trade. Later, the town had important trade links with North America and, at its peak during the 18th century, {{it was one of the}} busiest ports in Britain. In the Second World War, Poole <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> departing points for the Normandy landings.|$|E
5|$|Jocelin <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> advisors of King John {{during the}} {{dispute with the}} pope over Stephen Langton's {{appointment}} to the Archbishopric of Canterbury. Jocelin did not immediately leave England after Pope Innocent III placed an interdict on England. Jocelin encouraged John to settle with Innocent in early 1209, worried that Innocent would expand the interdict into an excommunication, forcing John's advisors to choose between serving the king or obeying the pope. Nothing came of the negotiations, however. Jocelin did leave England when John was excommunicated in late 1209. Jocelin, along with Gilbert Glanvill, the Bishop of Rochester, {{was the subject of}} a mocking song on his conduct during the interdict.|$|E
5|$|Martin Nyrop <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> {{proponents of}} the National Romantic style. The main aim was to use {{distinctive}} Nordic motifs from the distant past, as is clearly demonstrated in Copenhagen City Hall which was completed in 1905. The City Hall is certainly Copenhagen's most monumental and most original building from {{the last quarter of}} the 19th century with its impressive facade, the golden statue of Absalon just above the balcony and its tall, slim clock tower. It was inspired by the Siena City Hall.|$|E

5|$|Reginald {{took part}} in the {{negotiations}} in August and September 1169 that attempted to reach a settlement between Henry and Becket. These negotiations included papal nuncios and most of the Norman bishops and prominent abbots, as well as the royal clerks. However, the negotiations came to nothing, and led to Becket's castigation of Reginald. Reginald <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> clerics working for King Henry during the dispute with Becket, along with John of Oxford, Richard of Ilchester, and Geoffrey Ridel. Henry's plans to reward the four with bishoprics in late 1170 probably precipitated the final crisis that led to Becket's murder.|$|E
5|$|Senator McCain {{became a}} member of the Armed Services Committee, with which he had {{formerly}} done his Navy liaison work; he also joined the Commerce Committee and the Indian Affairs Committee. He continued to support the Native American agenda. As first a House member and then a senator– and as a lifelong gambler with close ties to the gambling industry– McCain <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> authors of the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, which codified rules regarding Native American gambling enterprises. McCain was also a strong supporter of the Gramm-Rudman legislation that enforced automatic spending cuts in the case of budget deficits.|$|E
5|$|The Allied bombing {{campaign}} <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> factors which influenced the Japanese government's decision to surrender in mid-August 1945. However, {{there has been}} a long-running debate over the morality of the attacks on Japanese cities, and the use of atomic weapons is particularly controversial. The most commonly cited estimate of Japanese casualties from the raids is 333,000 killed and 473,000 wounded. There {{are a number of other}} estimates of total fatalities, however, which range from 241,000 to 900,000. In addition to the loss of mostly civilian life, the raids contributed to a large decline in industrial production.|$|E

5|$|The draft helped {{increased}} the television ratings of Raw, which <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> {{purposes of the}} draft. The television rating for the three hours was 3.40 TVR, as it earned 2.78 TVR for the first hour, 3.46 TVR for the second hour, and 3.95 TVR for the final hour. In its regular time slot, the show would have garnered a 3.7 rating. Both ratings were higher than the week's previous rating of a 3.3 TVR.|$|E
5|$|Throughout most of {{the history}} of Poland, the banner of Poland <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> symbols of the Polish State, {{normally}} reserved for use by the head of state. Although its design changed with time, it was generally a heraldic banner, i.e., one based directly on the national coat of arms: a crowned White Eagle on a red field (Gules an eagle Argent crowned Or). The banner {{should not be confused with}} the flag of Poland, a white and red , officially adopted in 1919.|$|E
