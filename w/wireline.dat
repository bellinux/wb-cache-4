40|$|Abstract—Voice over Internet (VoIP) {{has been}} {{experiencing}} enormous growth in recent years. While posed to replace traditional PSTN for both enterprise and residential customers, VoIP {{has yet to}} achieve the same level of quality and reliability as PSTN. One key challenge is that a growing segment of customers is increasingly relying on WiFi connections. VoIP over WiFi (VoWiFi) experiences significant degradation in quality because of packet losses, mostly due to WiFi’s low capacity, varying signal strength, interference, etc. To understand this problem, we have developed and deployed a comprehensive measurement platform in a global enterprise network. From large-scale real-world traces, we quantitatively analyze the impact of WiFi connections and study measures to mitigate such impact. Our results confirm that WiFi connections incur significantly more packet losses than <b>wirelines,</b> but these losses can be effectively concealed by sending each packet up to five times (heavy replication). Due to WiFi’s inherent overhead, heavy replication only marginally increases WiFi airtime. To avoid the overhead on <b>wirelines,</b> we further propose a relaybased solution, where heavy replication only occurs between endpoints and nearby relays, and is removed before packets are transmitted on inter-branch long haul links or the public Internet. The solution has been implemented and deployed in the global enterprise network, and measurement results confirm that it can indeed greatly improve the performance of VoIP for WiFi users. In particular, it reduces the percentage of poor calls from 35 % to 10 %; and increases the percentage of acceptable ones from 45 % to 70 %. I...|$|R

The mobile subscriber base has grown by a factor of over a hundred and thirty, from 5 million subscribers in 2001 to over 929 million subscribers as of May 2012.

40|$|Future {{wireless}} {{networks are}} expected to support multimedia applications. Wireless links, however, have scarce bandwidth compared to <b>wirelines</b> and should support host mobility.

Thus, providing more suitable wireless service is a great challenge. In this paper, we introduce the concept of adaptive service as a mobile service, which provides at least minimum tolerable quality over wireless networks. Adaptive service guarantees only minimum bandwidth with which minimum tolerable quality can be obtained, and shares the leftover bandwidth among the good-channel-state flows to improve the total throughput in a cell.

However, techniques for improving or maintaining acceptable levels of channel integrity and information re-liability that have conventionally been applied to <b>wirelined</b> systems are no longer appropriate for the wireless medium.

500|$|Rotary {{drilling}} is {{the main}} method of drilling for minerals and {{it has also been}} used for ice drilling. It uses a string of drill pipe rotated from the top, and drilling fluid is pumped down through the pipe and back up around it. [...] The cuttings are removed from the fluid {{at the top of the}} hole and the fluid is then pumped back down. [...] This approach requires long trip times, since the entire drill string must be hoisted out of the hole, and each length of pipe must be separately disconnected, and then reconnected when the drill string is reinserted. [...] Along with the logistical difficulties associated with bringing heavy equipment to ice sheets, this makes traditional rotary drills unattractive. [...] In contrast, <b>wireline</b> drills allow the removal of the core barrel from the drill assembly while it is still at the bottom of the borehole. [...] The core barrel is hoisted to the surface, and the core removed; the barrel is lowered again and reconnected to the drill assembly. [...] Another alternative is flexible drill-stem rigs, in which the drill string is flexible enough to be coiled when at the surface. [...] This eliminates the need to disconnect and reconnect the pipes during a trip.The need for a string of drillpipe that extends from the surface to the bottom of the borehole can be eliminated by suspending the entire downhole assembly on an armoured cable that conveys power to the downhole motor. [...] These cable-suspended drills can be used for both shallow and deep holes; they require an anti-torque device, such as leaf-springs that press against the borehole, to prevent the drill assembly rotating around the drillhead as it cuts the core. [...] The drilling fluid is usually circulated down around the outside of the drill and back up between the core and core barrel; the cuttings are stored in the downhole assembly, in a chamber above the core. [...] When the core is retrieved, the cuttings chamber is emptied for the next run. [...] Some drills have been designed to retrieve a second annular core outside the central core, and in these drills the space between the two cores can be used for circulation.

Centralized and joint baseband (BB) processing of all femtocell signals can reduce inter-cell/intra-cell interference {{at the expense of}} fast signaling and strict synchronization to coordinate the multiple femtocell links. In this article, we revisit the conventional femtocell architecture by proposing the multi-cell baseband processing for interference mitigation based on a distributed antennas system. The proposed configuration resorts to the wireless over cable (WoC) paradigm and is based on the concept of replacing the in-house base station (Femtocell Access Point) with a home-device that simply transfers the analog radio frequency (RF) signals from the air-link to the existing cable connections. These home-devices act as bidirectional amplify-and-forward (AF) relays of air signals toward cable (and vice-versa) by operating a frequency conversion of the wireless spectrum to accommodate the cable specifications and coexistence with other services. Splitting RF processing (at home) from baseband processing (centralized at the nearest street cabinet or central office collecting multiple cables) guarantees that multi-cell processing exploits the same advantages as MIMO systems.
