50|$|A {{spar buoy}} is a tall, thin buoy that floats upright {{in the water}} and is {{characterized}} by a small <b>water</b> <b>plane</b> <b>area</b> and a large mass. Because they tend to be stable ocean platforms, spar buoys are popular for making oceanographic measurements. Adjustment of the <b>water</b> <b>plane</b> <b>area</b> and the mass allows spar buoys to be tuned so they tend to not respond to wave forcing. This characteristic differentiates them from large <b>water</b> <b>plane</b> <b>area</b> buoys such as discus buoys that tend to be wave followers. Spar buoys are often used as stable platforms for wave measurement devices and air-sea interaction measurements. Spar buoys range in length from a few feet to the 354-foot (108 meter) RV FLIP. To avoid the difficulties inherent with shipboard launch and recovery, helicopter deployment of large spar buoys has been studied.|$|E
40|$|Recent concept ship designs {{have called}} for a vessel with the {{capability}} to lift and transport multiple medium displacement combatant boats, approximately 40 to 100 tons, at high speeds over thousands of nautical miles. One such design placed two small <b>water</b> <b>plane</b> <b>area</b> (SWATH) side hulls significantly aft of the center hull transom to facilitate a heavy duty hoist system. This thesis determines the optimal longitudinal and lateral positioning of small <b>water</b> <b>plane</b> <b>area</b> side hulls, and the number of and associated position of struts that would be used in a large displacement small <b>water</b> <b>plane</b> <b>area</b> trimaran design. The analysis explores eighteen different small <b>water</b> <b>plane</b> <b>area</b> side hull configurations to verify through a series of computational fluid dynamics calculations the total resistance and wake characteristics of the overall hull designs. A mathematical analysis of the wave making, frictional, and pressure resistance of each of the hull configurations will be developed using the Rankine Panel Method from the surface wave and flow analysis software package called SWAN 2. Static stability and geometry data is generated for the concept design using computer aided design and RHINOMARINE hydrostatic analysis software. A systematic analysis of the results is conducted {{in order to determine the}} optimal side hullseparation, longitudinal position, and number of struts for best resistance and static stability which can then be used in a systems engineering process for further study of the feasibility of the use of a small waterplane area trimaran for a concept design.

The structure of Zn-Al-layered double hydroxide intercalated by pyrenetetra- sulfonate acid was solved. Depending on the relative humidity, the samples showed different arrangements with three planes of water molecules and with either one or two planes of pyrenetetrasulfonate anions. At the same time considerable variability of anions arrangement was demonstrated. The adsorption behavior of natural montmorillonite and montmorillonite modified by tetramethylammonium cations in relation to aniline and phe- nol was explored. Adsorption features differed according to both the type of adsorbed molecules {{and the type of}} adsorbents.

40|$|A spar-type {{floating}} substructure that {{is being}} widely used for offshore wind power generation is vulnerable to resonance in the heave direction because of its small <b>water</b> <b>plane</b> <b>area.</b> For this reason, the stable dynamic response of this floating structure should be ensured by accurately identifying the resonance characteristics. The {{purpose of this study}} is to analyze the characteristics of the combination resonance between the excitation frequency of a regular wave and natural frequencies of the floating substructure. First, the nonlinear equations of motion with two degrees of freedom are derived by assuming that the floating substructure is a rigid body, where the heaving motion and pitching motions are coupled. Moreover, to identify the characteristics of the combination resonance, the nonlinear term in the nonlinear equations is approximated up to the second order using the Taylor series expansion. Furthermore, the validity of the approximate model is confirmed through a comparison with the results of a numerical analysis which is made by applying the commercial software ANSYS AQWA to the full model. The result indicates that the combination resonance occurs at the frequencies of ω±ωn 5 and 2 ωn 5 between the excitation frequency (ω) of a regular wave and the natural frequency of the pitching motion (ωn 5) of the floating substructure...|$|E

Acoustic Doppler current profiler surveys were performed to investigate local velocity profiles. A small <b>water</b> <b>plane</b> <b>area</b> twin hull (Swath) bathymetric survey established the local bathymetry of the area. Energy extraction from a three-bladed 10 m diameter turbine was studied using a quasi-static computational fluid dynamics model and velocity profile data from the acoustic Doppler current profiler surveys. The acoustic Doppler current profiler data were rescaled allowing further insight to the attenuation of power density through the water column at a higher tidal velocity. The velocity profile has a significant effect on power attenuation reducing the extracted power to 30 – 40 % of peak power. The turbine performance calculation is highly dependent on the velocity used; the velocity should be monitored around five turbine diameters upstream, at the depth of its axis of rotation. The axial load on the turbine peaks at the freewheeling velocity dropping to 88 % at peak power. It is suggested that the velocity at the Severn estuary site is, unlike the Anglesey site, unlikely to provide a suitable level of power to be viable...|$|E

40|$|The STC (Spar Torus Combination) concept {{combines}} a Spar {{floating wind turbine}} and a torus-shaped heaving-body wave energy converter (WEC). Numerical simulation has shown positive synergy between the WEC and the Spar floating wind turbine in operational conditions. However, in extreme wind and wave conditions, {{it is challenging to}} maintain structural integrity, especially for the WEC. To ensure survivability of this concept in extreme conditions, three survival modes have been proposed. To investigate the performance of the STC in extreme conditions, model tests with a scale factor of 1 : 50 were carried out in the towing tank of MARINTEK, Norway. Two survival modes were tested. In both modes, the Torus WEC was fixed to the Spar. In the first mode, the Torus WEC is at the mean water surface, while in the second mode, the Torus WEC is fully submerged to a specified position. In the tests, 6 D. O. F rigid body motions, mooring line tensions, forces in 3 directions (X, Y and Z) between the Spar and Torus were measured, wind velocity and wind force were also measured by a sensor in front of the model and a load cell installed on the wind disc.

In the mean water level survival mode, the Torus had a small draft and large <b>water</b> <b>plane</b> <b>area,</b> so slamming and green water were observed as expected.

40|$|In 2014, 536 {{offshore}} wind turbines were installed on European shelf, connecting {{an average of}} 5. 9 MW to the grid every day. About two thirds of this were installed in the North Sea. This new and emerging market represents an opportunity for Norway {{to make use of}} our knowledge about marine operations in the North Sea from the petroleum industry. In this thesis the op- eration of accessing the wind turbine to transfer personnel and parts is investigated. Due to maintenance and unexpected repair the wind turbine needs to be accessed by technicians about three times per year. Hence, for a wind farm of some size, the access operation is done a signicant amount of times per year. The lack of a sufficient robust and cheap way to do this has proven a costly problem for the industry. Another problem is how to analyse and compare different access concepts. Time domain simulations as widely used in the oshore petroleum industry are time consuming and expensive, as you in principle should find one limiting Hs for all combinations of peak period and wave direction each concept will encounter to do a fair comparison. Therefore, MARINTEK's MingKang Wu in 2014 proposed a efficient way to calculate the limiting signifi- cant wave height for all combinations of peak period and wave direction in the frequency domain. At Dogger Bank location two, the moderate sea states were access is realistic have peak pe- riods in the area of 5 to 9 seconds. Having a small <b>water</b> <b>plane</b> <b>area</b> vessel designed to have low responses in this frequency area, such as a SWATH or a mini semi-submersible might be a good access solution on such a location. There is different strategies on how to access the wind turbine, fender docking is a popular choice today due to its simplicity and lack of vul- nerable expensive parts. Considering its superior velocity to the semi-submersible, a SWATH concept with fender docking was chosen for further analysis. The concept was inspired by the FOB SWATH used by Oddfjell Wind AS and has been created and analysed in VERES. Fur- ther, fender docking with this vessel was analysed with a MATLAB program containing the frequency domain method proposed by Wu (2014) and in the time domain simulation software SIMO. This thesis have three focal points, which this SWATH concept has been used to investigate. Firstly, to explore what parameters that {{should be included in the}} accept criteria for initiating the access operation. It was found that the limiting significant wave height depend on both peak period and direction of wave environment. Hence, it is recommended to step away from the industry standard of considering limiting Hs as a constant value, and consider limiting Hs as a function of peak period and wave direction. The second were to explore the potential of small <b>water</b> <b>plane</b> <b>area</b> solutions. It was found that it is feasible to design a SWATH to maximize its performance in a specic wave environ- ment. The producers of classical work boat catamarans claims that their vessels can access an {{offshore wind}} turbine in Hs up to 1. 5 m without considering Tp nor wave direction. Comparing this with the results from the Matlab program and SIMO, the SWATH concept analysed can not outperform this. One should nevertheless have in mind that as this is not a design thesis, the concept investigated is not optimized and that a optimized vessel surely would outperform the SWATH considered here. As well there is a chance that the limit of 1. 5 m Hs typically given by the manufacturers is somewhat optimistic. It might for instance only be valid in favorable combinations of Tp and wave direction, this belief is supported by wind farm owners reporting of work boats not being able to perform as promised in all sea states. The last focal point were to verify the method proposed by Wu (2014) by time domain simula- tion in SIMO. The method has not been verified, the results obtained by the use of Wu (2014) and time domain simulation in SIMO had large deviations. It was found that the simplification done by Wu that the propeller thrust works in the global x-direction directly in the fender point, at least is one of the reasons why the method underestimate the risk of slip. In the end of chapter three a frequency domain method where the propeller thrust is directed along the local x-axis is proposed. To improve the modelling of fender docking,one should improve the understanding of how the fenders dynamic and static coefficient depend on pressure, temperature,slip velocity and hu- midity. Another improvement would be to investigate whether diffraction effects from the wind turbine needs to be included in the analysis...|$|E
40|$|Wave energy {{converters}} {{of point}} absorber type {{have been developed}} and constructed. Full scale experiments {{have been carried out}} at sea and electricity has been successfully delivered. Linear permanent magnet generators together with a subsea substation and buoys of various geometric shapes have been investigated theoretically and experimentally. The design has in large extent an electronic approach, keeping the mechanical part of it as simple as possible, due to the long life span and reliability of electric components. Because of the nature of a linear generator, the internal translator with permanent magnets has a limited stroke length which will be reached when the buoy is exposed to large wave heights. Internal springs at {{the top and bottom of}} the generator prevent the translator from hitting the generator hull. Inertial forces due to the mass and velocity of the translator and the buoy and its heave added mass compresses the spring. The added mass is a rather large part of the total moving mass. Simulations of a converter with a vertical cylindrical buoy and with a toroidal buoy were conducted, as well as real sea experiments with converters with cylindrical buoys of two different sizes and a toroidal buoy. The overloads are likely to affect the design and service life of the generator, the buoy and the wire which interconnects them. Buoy shapes with as much excitation force as possible and as little heave added mass as possible were sought. A toroidal buoy caused less overloads on the generator at sea states with short wave periods and relatively large wave height, but for sea states with very long wave periods or extremely high waves, the magnitude of the overloads was mainly determined by the maximum displacement of the buoy. Snap loads on the interconnecting wire, as the slack wire tensed up after a very deep wave trough, were found to be greater but of the same order of magnitude as forces during the rest of the wave cycle. During a 4 day period at various wave conditions, two converters with cylindrical buoys proved efficiency between 11. 1 % and 24. 4 %. The larger buoy had 78 % larger <b>water</b> <b>plane</b> <b>area</b> than the other buoy which resulted in 11 % more power production. Short wave period was beneficial for the power production.

40|$|The {{shifting}} of the European energy market towards the wind energy means {{there will be}} more wind farms developed in deeper water and farther away from the shore. The existing infrastructure being used for installation is seldom purpose-built for this task, resulting in delays and consequently loss of money for the operators and contractors. Furthermore, the existing process is labor intensive, time consuming and not very safe, the vessels are limited by design to work in moderate sea conditions that for instance exist in the North Sea during the summer season. Seaway Heavy Lifting has been actively involved in solutions for the single lift installation of wind turbine generators (WTG’s). This thesis is to investigate whether there can be a new concept based on improved hull shapes to install WTG’s in a single lift operation more efficiently. The study involves the development of a concept which can provide safe and speedy transportation and installation of fully assembled next generation WTG’s. The selection of the hull shape is based on an extensive but subjective multi criteria analysis using the mission profile and functional requirements of the vessel and available research & operational data. Most important criteria used are: sufficient capacity to carry 8 completely assembled WTG’s of 7 MW in vertical position on deck, sufficient speed potential for good North Sea logistics, good motion characteristics for high installation work-ability, sufficient stability to perform the lifting task. From the multi criteria analysis the SWATH (small <b>water</b> <b>plane</b> <b>area</b> twin hull) appears to be the most promising hull shape and is therefore selected for further analysis. Because Seaway Heavy Lifting has more than two decades experience with mono hull heavy lift vessels, a dual draft mono hull vessel dedicated for WTG installation is also analysed for reference. The dimensions of both vessels are determined based on a parametric study in order to comply with the various design requirements. The required deck area and layout together with the strict stability requirements like drop load criteria and intact stability turned out to be important for overall dimensions of both the SWATH and dual draft mono hull. Furthermore a sensitivity analysis is done on these dimensions to check which ones affect the operability of the SWATH. The stability calculations are validated with the help of recognized stability software. Different speed scenarios are evaluated for a given location to check the dependence on vessel speed, resistance and power requirements which could limit the operability. Based on the derived dimensions both vessels are subjected to multi-body frequency domain motion analysis using a recognized hydrodynamics program. Subsequently the workability of both vessels is investigated using very detailed 2 D wave spectral data available for an important North Sea wind farm development area. The results of this thesis are the first steps towards establishing the SWATH as a viable option for operating as a WTG installation vessel. The motion behavior of the SWATH is better than the mono hull in certain important operational conditions. There are some significant advantages which the SWATH exhibits over the Monohull and other hull forms which can be utilized for the purpose of WTG installation and helps in avoiding complex installation systems and techniques to get safe and fast operation.

5000|$|The 2nd {{moment of}} area, {{also known as}} moment of inertia of <b>plane</b> <b>area,</b> area moment of inertia, or second area moment, is a {{geometrical}} property of an area which reflects how its points are distributed with regard to an arbitrary axis. The {{second moment of area}} is typically denoted with either an [...] for an axis that lies in the plane or with a [...] for an axis perpendicular to the plane. In both cases, it is calculated with a multiple integral over the object in question. Its unit of dimension when working with the International System of Units is meters to the fourth power, m4.|$|R
