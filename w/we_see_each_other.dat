The release of the official music video followed on 17 May 2017 on the same platform, but was not made available to watch until 26 May 2017. It was directed by Manuel Escalante of Enjambre Producciones in different locations in Mexico City and Barcelona, with production and photography handled by him along with Petter Lettocha and José Casillas. When interviewed, Muñiz expained {{the concept of the}} visual, [...] " [...] We were very moved by {{the idea of having a}} story of a long-distance virtual and sentimental relationship that is carried out through virtual reality: one in Mexico and the other one in Barcelona. Everything begins [...] when I invariably connect with my partner (Alexandra Stan) through a virtual reality system in which we live a super romance and where <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> in different locations in Mexico City and Barcelona." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the re-release, {{the group}} were interviewed by Bradley Stern on MuuMuse, and {{was asked about}} a reunion and {{relationship}} together. Volkova stated [...] "We don't keep in touch", while Katina stated [...] "Only when <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> We have very different lives in different countries now. We {{are not in a}} fight though." [...] As for reunion, Katina said [...] "I believe that there is always a chance for anything in this life. Maybe…." [...] Volkova stated that, while she is not [...] "ready for it", she said [...] "But this won’t stop us from reuniting for joint performances. We’ll see what happens!" ...|$|E

Yes, there is – that I {{do not have}} her forgiveness; and she is and remains an intermediate court, a legitimate court, that must not be bypassed. Her forgiveness certainly cannot justify me eternally, {{no more than a}} person’s implacability can harm anyone but himself, but her forgiveness is a part of a divine procedure. Why, then, do you not have it? Because I could not make myself understandable to her. ... Suppose she had forgiven me. Then, of course, she would not have forgotten me. But can <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> then? Suppose she stood beside someone else. When she stands that way within time, I am standing in her path and therefore shall go away. But if I stood in her path in eternity, where should I go. Compared with eternity, is time the stronger? Has time the power to separate us eternally?" [...] Søren Kierkegaard, Stages on Life's Way (1845), Hong p. 380-382, 390-391What would indeed be as disconsolate, yes, {{almost to the point of}} despair, as this-if, at the moment when the misunderstanding one returned and sought understanding, when the unfriendly one returned and sought friendship, when the one who had hated returned and sought reconciliation-what would be as disconsolate as this: if the one who loves has then wasted away, so that neither understanding nor the restoration of friendship nor the renewal of reconciliation in love could really take place with the blessed joy of eternity! On the other hand, what can make [...] the moment of forgiveness, the transition of agreement so natural, so easy as this: that the one who loves by abiding, has continually cleared away the past. Works of Love, 1847 Hong 1995 p. 313-314"You must have God’s help to believe that you are saved by Baptism; you must have God’s help to believe that in the Lord’s Supper you receive the gracious forgiveness of your sins. Be it done for you as you believe. But everything in you that is flesh and blood and is timorousness and attachment to things of this earth must despair, so that you cannot acquire external certainty. If this like for like holds true even in relation to what most definitely must be called Gospel, how much more, then, when Christianity is itself the Law. “Forgive, then you will be forgiven" [...] Works of Love, Sep 29, 1847, Hong 378-380 ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You told me <b>we</b> should <b>see</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> no more, and {{you have}} come back. It is my turn now to go, and to go forever. I say that <b>we</b> shall <b>see</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> no more, and my word shall not be broken." ...|$|R
6000|$|For {{though we}} never spoke [...] Of the grey {{water and the}} shaded rock, [...] Dark wave and stone unconsciously were fused [...] Into the plaintive {{speaking}} that we used [...] Of absent friends and memories unforsook; [...] And, had <b>we</b> <b>seen</b> <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> face, <b>we</b> had [...] Seen haply each was sad.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well--well! We are {{not going}} so very far. Not so very far. Perhaps <b>we</b> shall <b>see</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> another day. It may be. Good-bye!" ...|$|R
6000|$|If what I {{have here}} written appear {{nonsense}} to you, or common sense in a harlequinade of [...] "outre" [...] expressions, suspend your judgment till <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "No man {{has ever}} struck me twice," [...] she said, [...] "and my husband shall have no second opportunity. Set {{the door open}} and let me go. From this day forth <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> no more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Try again, my love!" [...] she said, cheerily. [...] "Let us {{vary the}} experiment. We will start {{as we did}} before, but not to begin {{counting}} till our trains meet. When <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> we will say 'One!' and so count on till we come here again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose <b>we</b> shall <b>see</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> sometimes, George," [...] Maryanne said to him, {{when she}} came down to his little room to bid him farewell.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is one day more {{so long to}} wait? [...] Moreover the Duke rides past, I know; [...] 80 [...] <b>We</b> shall <b>see</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> sure as fate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I {{can remain}} quiet longer than you. It {{will be very}} quiet. I wonder how <b>we</b> shall <b>see</b> <b>each</b> <b>other!</b> I cannot walk across the park alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That will do, sir. You {{need not}} remain longer in your room, {{but you will}} not leave the grounds. My friend's ship is at Portsmouth at present, and doubtless I shall receive an answer {{in the course of}} a few days. Until then, the less <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> the more {{pleasant}} for us both." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quick! When can <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>each</b> <b>other?</b> I {{will come}} to you to tea--to-morrow," [...] and, {{following}} her eyes, he saw the door opening, and Cramier coming in. Unsmiling, very big in the low room, he crossed over to them, and offered his hand to Lennan; then drawing a low chair forward between their two chairs, sat down.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes! There's one thing, if I {{may make}} so bold, I {{should like to}} know. Mr. Gloody is as good to me as good can be; <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> continually, {{living in the same}} place. But you are different; and he tells me himself he has only seen you twice. What have you done, Mr. Gerard, to make him like you so well, in that short time?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, maties," [...] {{said one}} of them, at last--"I spose <b>we</b> shan't <b>see</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> again:--come, let's splice the main-brace all round, and drink to the last voyage!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{may not be}} possible, you know. And {{therefore}} we will go on as before. Of course <b>we</b> shall <b>see</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> {{and of course we}} shall be friends." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>we</b> shall <b>see</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> again. Don't be worried." [...] He {{looked up}} at her with a smile, and he could not see how forlornly she {{returned}} it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{glad you}} arrived before your sister, Phil," [...] said Miss Lillycrop. [...] "Of course I asked her here to meet you. I {{am so sorry}} the dear girl cannot live with me: I had fully meant that she should, but my little rooms are {{so far from the}} Post-Office, where her work is, you know, that it could not be managed. However, <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> as often as possible, and she visits {{sometimes}} with me in my district. What has made you so late, Phil?" ...|$|E
60|$|DON JUAN. You see, Senora, {{the look}} {{was only an}} illusion. Your {{wrinkles}} lied, just as the plump smooth skin of many a stupid girl of 17, with heavy spirits and decrepit ideas, lies about her age? Well, here we have no bodies: <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> as bodies only because we learnt to think about one another under that aspect when we were alive; and we still think in that way, knowing no other. But we can appear to one another at what age we choose. You have but to will any of your old looks back, and back they will come.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Grey, I fear {{you find}} me in bad spirits to-day; but alas! I--I have cause. Although <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> to-day for the first time, yet there is {{something}} in your manner, something in the expression of your eyes, that make me believe my happiness is not altogether a matter of indifference to you." [...] These words, uttered in one of the sweetest voices by which ever human being was fascinated, were slowly and deliberately spoken, as if it were intended that they should rest on the ear of the object to whom they were addressed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quarrel with you! I {{could not}} quarrel with you, if I would. No;--there shall be no quarrel. But I do not suppose <b>we</b> shall <b>see</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> very often." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{think you}} are steadier than he is, and can do more for him than he can for you. I wonder, shall <b>we</b> ever <b>see</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> again, Mr. Caldigate?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Much better {{pleased to}} think it was ten than to have no such hope at all. Of course <b>we</b> shall <b>see</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> It's not as though you were going to New Zealand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{exquisite}} kindness it must be," [...] she said, [...] "that blinds {{a clever}} man {{like you to}} obstacles which anyone else can see! Remember, dear Hugh, what the world would say to that protection which your true heart offers to me. Are you my near relation? are you my guardian? are you even an old man? Ah me! you are only an angel of goodness whom I must submit to lose. I shall still count on your kindness when <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> no more. You will pity me, {{when you hear that}} I have fallen lower and lower; you will be sorry for me, when I end in disgracing myself." ...|$|E
60|$|So it {{was with}} this, in a word, that Mrs. Pendennis comforted herself {{on the death of}} her husband, whom, however, she always reverenced as the best, the most upright, wise, high-minded, accomplished, and awful of men. If the women did not make idols of us, and if they saw us as <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> would life be bearable, or could society go on? Let a man pray that none of his womankind should form a just {{estimation}} of him. If your wife knew you as you are, neighbour, she would not grieve much about being your widow, and would let your grave-lamp go out very soon, or perhaps not even take the trouble to light it. Whereas Helen Pendennis put up the handsomest of memorials to her husband, and constantly renewed it with the most precious oil.|$|E
6000|$|... 'We shall remember, mother!--we shall remember!' {{continued}} the Pagan softly, 'and be happy in our remembrances! My brother, who loves me not, will love you when I am gone! You will walk {{in my little}} garden, and think on me {{as you look at}} the flowers that we have planted and watered together in the evening hours, when the sky was glorious to behold, and the earth was all quiet around us! Listen, mother, and kiss me! When I go to the far country, I will make a garden there like my garden here, and plant the same flowers that we have planted here, and in the evening I will go out and give them water at the hour when you go out to give my flowers water at home; and so, though <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> no more, it will yet be as if we laboured together in the garden as we labour now!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>we</b> shall <b>see</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> daily, and {{be close}} to each other," [...] he said to Isa, looking tenderly into her eyes. [...] "Yes," [...] she replied, [...] "we shall <b>see</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> daily--of course. But, Herbert--" ...|$|R
5000|$|For example, one {{reported}} note by Provenzano read [...] "I met 512151522 191212154 and {{we agreed}} that <b>we</b> will <b>see</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> after the holidays..." [...] This name was decoded as [...] "Binnu Riina".|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you know, Mr. Meeson," [...] {{she said}} at last, without daring {{to look at his}} imploring face, [...] "that this is only the fourth time that <b>we</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> {{including}} yesterday." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the course}} of your {{personal}} interview with me, you audaciously referred to my late daughter's parentage on the father's side, as if that parentage was a matter of doubt. This was highly improper and very ungentlemanlike on your part! If <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> again, remember, if you please, that I will allow no liberties to be taken with my reputation, and that the moral atmosphere of Welmingham (to use a favourite expression of my friend the rector's) must not be tainted by loose conversation of any kind. If you allow yourself to doubt that my husband was Anne's father, you personally insult me in the grossest manner. If you have felt, and if you still continue to feel, an unhallowed curiosity on this subject, I recommend you, in your own interests, to check it at once, and for ever. On this side of the grave, Mr. Hartright, whatever may happen on the other, THAT curiosity will never be gratified.|$|E
6000|$|... "I talk as if I was a {{stranger}} here, do I?" [...] he resumed. [...] "That's exactly what I am. Lady Lundie and I correspond on excellent terms; but we run in different grooves, and <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> as seldom as possible. My story," [...] continued the pleasant old man, with a charming frankness which leveled all differences of age and rank between Arnold and himself, [...] "is not entirely unlike yours; though I am {{old enough to be}} your grandfather. I was getting my living, in my way (as a crusty old Scotch lawyer), when my brother married again. His death, without leaving a son by either of his wives, gave me a lift in the world, like you. Here I am (to my own sincere regret) the present baronet. Yes, to my sincere regret! All sorts of responsibilities which I never bargained for are thrust on my shoulders. I am the head of the family; I am my niece's guardian; I am compelled to appear at this lawn-party--and (between ourselves) I am as completely out of my element as a man can be. Not a single familiar face meets me among all these fine people. Do you know any body here?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Wann seh'n wir uns wieder" [...] ("Wenn Will <b>We</b> <b>See</b> <b>Each</b> <b>Other</b> Again") ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're {{very little}} changed, Leila! <b>We</b> haven't, <b>seen</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> since my {{youngest}} girl was born. She's {{just a little}} like you." [...] But he thought: 'My Nollie! So much more dewy; poor Leila!' ...|$|R
6000|$|Her face {{stiffened}} into rigidity; she dashed {{the tears}} from her eyes. [...] "No," [...] she said quickly. Then {{after a moment she}} added, with a faint laugh, [...] "You <b>see</b> <b>we</b> haven't <b>seen</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> for so long--it's all so sudden--so unexpected." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I'm sure {{nothing will}} go wrong now. You mustn't feel {{responsible}} for us. But, uh, you understand we're {{very grateful for}} {{what you have done}} and, uh, perhaps <b>we</b> shall <b>see</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> in Seattle?" [...] She made it brightly interrogatory.|$|R
