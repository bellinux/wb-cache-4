5|$|Habitat {{enhancements}} used {{to increase}} the breeding success of terns include floating nest platforms for black, common and Caspian terns, and artificial islands created {{for a number of}} different species. More specialised interventions include providing nest boxes for roseate terns, <b>which</b> <b>normally</b> nest in the shelter of tallish vegetation, and using artificial eelgrass mats to encourage common terns to nest in areas not vulnerable to flooding.|$|E

5|$|The shield is {{the core}} of heraldry, but other {{elements}} are placed above, below, and around the shield, and are usually collectively called external ornaments.

5|$|Weather fronts are {{boundaries}} between two masses of air of different densities, or different temperature and moisture properties, <b>which</b> <b>normally</b> are convergence zones {{in the wind}} field and are the principal cause of significant weather. Within surface weather analyses, they are depicted using various colored lines and symbols. The air masses usually differ in temperature and may also differ in humidity. Wind shear in the horizontal occurs near these boundaries.|$|E
5|$|About 1 in 300 to 500 {{people have}} {{mutations}} in the LDLR gene that encodes the LDL receptor protein, <b>which</b> <b>normally</b> removes LDL from the circulation, or apolipoprotein B (ApoB), {{which is the}} part of LDL that binds with the receptor; mutations in other genes are rare. People who have one abnormal copy (are heterozygous) of the LDLR gene may develop cardiovascular disease prematurely at the age of 30 to 40. Having two abnormal copies (being homozygous) may cause severe cardiovascular disease in childhood. Heterozygous FH is a common genetic disorder, inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, occurring in 1:500 people in most countries; homozygous FH is much rarer, occurring in 1 in a million births.|$|E

Over {{the course of the}} series, they meet two of the guards: Edaniel, a {{grinning}} cat-like creature, and his brother Edrear, who secretly likes Dinah. Vincent dies while in one of the vaults, causing Dinah to become depressed. Later, the hooded angel, <b>which</b> <b>normally</b> guards the entrance to the mausoleum, appears as two stones that talk to Dinah and help her overcome the depression which resulted from Vincent's death.|$|E

In time, Edward was anointed by Archbishops Dunstan and Oswald at Kingston upon Thames, most likely in 975. There is evidence that the settlement involved a degree of compromise. Æthelred appears to have been given lands <b>which</b> <b>normally</b> belonged to the king's sons, some of which had been granted by Edgar to Abingdon Abbey and which were forcibly repossessed for Æthelred by the leading nobles.|$|E
5|$|On June10, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began {{monitoring}} {{a persistent}} area of convection situated about 140kilometres (85mi) southeast of Palau. Satellite imagery depicted an elongated low-level circulation with deep convection centered along the southwestern {{portion of the}} system. Strong wind shear, <b>which</b> <b>normally</b> inhibits cyclonic development, provided energy for further convective development around the system. Tracking in a general northwestward direction, the low gradually developed northward outflow due to a tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT) located north of the disturbance. Following further development, the Japan Meteorological Agency declared {{the system as a}} tropical depression at 0600UTC on June14.|$|E
5|$|Symptoms of {{diabetes}} insipidus should prompt a formal fluid deprivation test {{to assess the}} body's response to dehydration, <b>which</b> <b>normally</b> causes concentration of the urine and increasing osmolarity of the blood. If these parameters are unchanged, desmopressin (an ADH analogue) is administered. If the urine then becomes concentrated and the blood osmolarity falls, {{there is a lack}} of ADH due to lack of pituitary function ("cranial diabetes insipidus"). In contrast, there is no change if the kidneys are unresponsive to ADH due to a different problem ("nephrogenic diabetes insipidus").|$|E

5|$|The 2010 Winter Olympic Games and Paralympic Games {{were held}} in Vancouver and Whistler, British Columbia, Canada. The Olympics ran from February 12 to February 28, 2010, and the Paralympics from March 12 to March 21, during which nine {{competition}} venues were used, spread across Vancouver, Whistler, and the neighbouring areas of West Vancouver and Richmond. The majority of ice sport events {{were held in}} Vancouver, while Whistler, <b>which</b> <b>normally</b> serves as a ski resort, hosted the snow events. Six non-competition venues, three each in Vancouver and Whistler, provided athlete housing, space for media, and locations for ceremonies associated with the Games.|$|E
5|$|The Prana (breath, vital air) of {{the body}} is {{dispersed}} within and outside the body. The first aim of yoga is to become aware and control this vital air, to be equal to or lower than the inner fire within one's body. This inner fire resides in the middle part {{of the body}}, and he calls it the Nabhi (center) and a Chakra. This is the residence of the Jiva, and the vital air nourishes it from below while one is alive. Just above this Nabhi is the kundalini <b>which</b> <b>normally</b> is dormant. Yoga awakens her, by bringing vital air and heat to her.|$|E
5|$|The Scottish Parliament Building at Holyrood itself did {{not open}} until October 2004, after lengthy {{construction}} delays and running over budget. The Scottish Parliament has {{a form of}} proportional representation (the additional member system), <b>which</b> <b>normally</b> results in no one party having an overall majority. The pro-independence Scottish National Party led by Alex Salmond achieved this in the 2011 election, winning 69 of the 129 seats available. The success of the SNP in achieving {{a majority in the}} Scottish Parliament {{paved the way for the}} September 2014 referendum on Scottish independence. The majority voted against the proposition, with 55% voting no to independence. More powers, particularly in relation to taxation, were devolved to the Scottish Parliament after the referendum, following cross-party talks in the Smith Commission.|$|E

5|$|The {{life cycle}} of D.sayi begins with copulation, <b>which</b> <b>normally</b> takes place shortly after the female has moulted, while her {{exoskeleton}} is still soft. Spawning occurs within hours or days of copulation, and the eggs are brooded on the female's pleopods (swimmerets) until {{they are ready to}} hatch. Females have been found carrying eggs from April to October; in a study of crabs caught at Gloucester Point, Virginia in 1978, females were observed to carry between 686 and 14,735 eggs. The number of eggs increases with carapace width according to a power law; extrapolation of the power law suggests that the largest D.sayi females are capable of carrying over 32,000 eggs each.|$|E
5|$|The new Dunston B Power Station was {{designed}} by consulting engineers Merz & McLellan. Its design {{was different from the}} design of other power stations at the time because it enclosed the machinery in a steel frame clad with glass. This was a departure from the usual power station designs, <b>which</b> <b>normally</b> enclosed the machinery in a concrete or brick wall. Dunston B is thought to be the first power station in the UK and possibly even the world to be built in this way. The station was also the first in the world to use metal clad switchgear at a voltage as high as 66,000V.|$|E
5|$|The peasants {{from the}} mountainous regions of Palestine and Bedouin (nomadic) warriors {{constituted}} {{the bulk of}} the rebels' forces. Most adult males among the peasantry owned a rifle (typically of the matchlock variety, ownership of <b>which</b> <b>normally</b> transferred from generation to generation) or less frequently, a pistol. The latter were often used in urban environments where they were more effective. A wide array of melee weapons were also utilized, including scimitars (generally used by Bedouin fighters), daggers, javelins, or different types of clubs (generally used by peasant fighters).|$|E
