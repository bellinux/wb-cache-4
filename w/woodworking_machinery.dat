25|$|<b>Woodworking</b> <b>machinery</b> that {{perform a}} similar {{function}} as hand planes include the jointer and the thickness planer, also called a thicknesser; the job these specialty power tools {{can still be}} done by hand planers and skilled manual labor {{as it was for}} many centuries. When rough lumber is reduced to dimensional lumber, a large electric motor or internal combustion engine will drive a thickness planer that removes a certain percentage of excess wood to create a uniform, smooth surface on all four sides of the board and in specialty woods, may also plane the cut edges.|$|E
25|$|P. M. Barber was {{the first}} person to come to Montgomery and {{establish}} an industry that achieved any sustainable success. He opened a distillery in 1859 and later a planing mill in 1869 on the site of the distillery. Barber, along with his partners, A.B. Henderson, Jesse Rank, and Nathan Fowler, had so much success that they laid out a town around their mill in 1870. The town was further expanded by the success of Montgomery Machine Shops, which, starting in 1873 under the supervision of Levi Houston, built <b>woodworking</b> <b>machinery</b> that was sold to clients throughout the United States and Canada and as far away as Australia.|$|E
50|$|The city’s other {{economic}} sectors, such as services, commerce, construction industry, {{have been influenced}} by the development of tourism. Commerce {{is one of the main}} economic sectors, thanks to the presence of a large wholesale center, two hypermarkets, department stores, supermarkets and hundreds of shops and boutiques. Industry, less developed than tourism and services, includes various companies active in food industry, <b>woodworking</b> <b>machineries,</b> building constructions, furnishing, clothing and publishing. Notable companies are Bimota (motorcycles), SCM (woodworking machines), Trevi S.p.A. (electronic goods). Rimini is also seat of an historic railway works plant.|$|R

2500|$|In 1861, he {{resigned}} from R, visiting Paris, {{then went on}} to England, working with the country's top engineering firms, becoming knowledgeable with machine tools. He spent from autumn 1861 to summer 1863 in England, then regarded as [...] "the motherland of technology", at Beyer, Peacock and Company of Gorton, Manchester. Beyer was from Saxony. While in London, he visited the 1862 International Exhibition, where one of the exhibits was a steam carriage. These carriages did not evidently inspire him, however, for his wish was to produce machine tools and <b>woodworking</b> <b>machinery.</b>|$|E

5000|$|NAM {{was founded}} by Thomas P. Egan, late President of the Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce {{and head of the}} J.A. Fay and Egan Co., <b>woodworking</b> and <b>machinery</b> company, not long after reading an {{editorial}} in the magazine [...] "Dixie," [...] out of Atlanta, Georgia, during the depression of 1894. This editorial urged the manufacturers of the time to organize and work together to improve business conditions nationally. Under Egan's leadership, organization began, and a group was created; they called themselves the [...] "Big 50"; he invited them, and asked them to invite others, to Cincinnati. On Jan 25, 1895, in the Oddfellows Temple, where 583 manufacturers attended, NAM was created. [...] "The U.S. {{was in the midst of}} a deep recession and many of the nation's manufacturers saw a strong need to export their products in other countries. One of the NAM's earliest efforts was to call for the creation of the U.S. Department of Commerce". [...] The organization's first president was Thomas Dolan of Philadelphia [...] (not, as erroneously listed in some sources, Samuel P. Bush).|$|R

50|$|The risks {{associated}} with the use of <b>woodworking</b> <b>machinery</b> are high since they rely on high-speed sharp cutters to do the job and in many cases, these are necessarily exposed to enable the machining process to take place. Additionally, many machines are still hand-fed; woodworking is probably the main industry where the hands of the operator are constantly exposed to danger.|$|E
50|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1919 in Nagoya by Saddakichi Yamazaki as a small company making pots and pans. During the 1920s it progressed through mat-making {{machinery}} to <b>woodworking</b> <b>machinery</b> to metalworking machine tools, especially lathes. The company was part of Japan's industrial buildup before and during World War II, then, {{like the rest of}} Japanese industry, was humbled by the war's outcome.|$|E
50|$|While both {{of these}} methods are still employed, {{technology}} has moved in around them. <b>Woodworking</b> <b>machinery</b> can now be controlled by computers, leading to much greater consistency. Molded signage has changed dramatically {{with the advent of}} plastics, which are far more flexible than metal as well as significantly cheaper to produce. Additionally, altogether new sign technologies have come into being, such as computer-cut vinyl signage..|$|E
5000|$|Magnetic {{starters}} {{are commonly}} found on equipment drawing several horsepower or higher. Examples include <b>woodworking</b> <b>machinery</b> such as cabinet saws or shapers. Machines with smaller loads, {{such as a}} drill press or most handheld tools normally use only a switch instead. Magnetic starters are stock components for many machines, and aftermarket starters are also available for use as replacements or for retrofitting older machines.|$|E
50|$|William Howard Doane (1832 - 1915) was a manufacturer, inventor, hymn writer, choral director, church {{leader and}} philanthropist. He {{composed}} over 2000 church hymns. More than seventy patents are credited {{to him for}} innovations in <b>woodworking</b> <b>machinery.</b> His philanthropy led to the renaming of the Granville Academy, as the Doane Academy, a boys’ and girls' private preparatory school associated with Denison University in Granville, Ohio, {{where he was a}} major benefactor.|$|E
50|$|While the vaults {{were under}} {{construction}} Bentham was ordering <b>woodworking</b> <b>machinery</b> {{of his own}} design, mostly up-and-down saws and circular saws. These were fitted-up in both ranges, the power to drive them being transmitted from the engines to the north range by underdrives through the upper layer of vaults, and then by vertical shafts to the upper floors of the buildings. The final drives to the machines was by flat belts running on pulleys.|$|E
50|$|The {{adjoining}} engineering {{works of}} A Ransome & Co, the original Stanley Works, were bought by Ransome & Marles {{when they were}} put up for sale in 1932. The premises were described as a freehold site of nine acres with sidings to the L & NE railway and factory buildings covering 130,000 sq ft. A. Ransome & Co's <b>woodworking</b> <b>machinery</b> business itself {{was taken over by}} the woodworking firm of John Pickles and Son of Hebden Bridge, Yorkshire.|$|E
50|$|Settled in 1770, it was {{incorporated}} in 1817, and {{is governed by}} a charter that was revised in 1890. Formerly, its extensive manufacturing plants included car and <b>woodworking</b> <b>machinery</b> shops; rolling, flour, knitting, planing, and saw mills; washer, nut, and bolt works; and furniture, shoe, couch, nail, fly net, bamboo novelty, and paper-box factories. In 1900, 6,175 people lived in Milton. In 1940, 8,313 people lived there. The population was 6,650 at the 2000 census, and 7,042 at the 2010 census.|$|E
50|$|It was {{converted}} to a sawmill around 1879. The waterwheel was removed and replaced with a Thomson double-vortex turbine, built by Williamsons (now Gilbert Gilkes & Gordon Ltd) of Kendal. This {{is thought to be}} the only remaining working variety of its type. In its heydey, the 10 hp (7.46 kW) created by the turbine drove a range of <b>woodworking</b> <b>machinery</b> - a rack sawbench, circular saw, thicknesser (planer), and lathes - by a series of belts and pulleys off a central line shaft.|$|E
5000|$|Doane’s {{support for}} the evangelically-oriented Moody Bible Institute is memorialized in the Doane Memorial Music Building. The {{building}} continues to house the Music Department’s faculty, classrooms and student practice space. [...] The J. A. Fay & Company’s <b>woodworking</b> <b>machinery</b> quality was significantly improved by Doane’s innovations and inventions. The company won numerous accolades around the world, including at the Paris Exposition of 1889, where it was awarded the Grand Prix. At the Exposition Doane was honored as a ‘Chevalier of the Legion of Honor’.|$|E
50|$|Matchboard {{was most}} {{popular in the}} late Victorian period, when <b>woodworking</b> <b>machinery</b> had {{developed}} that could cut the edge joints quickly and cheaply. In the 1930s, further developments in glues and veneer-cutting machinery made plywood affordable. This also gave a cleanly smooth-surfaced Modernist look that suited the taste for new styles. Matchboard then became much less popular. In the 1970s there was a resurgence {{of interest in the}} style as a retro feature, but this was usually provided, for cost reasons, as a faux matchboard effect pressed into the surface of a plywood board.|$|E
50|$|Wilhelm Blumwe, {{educated in}} Germany and in England, {{returned}} to Bydgoszcz in 1878. He partnered {{with his father}} {{in the conduct of}} the factory for <b>Woodworking</b> <b>Machinery.</b> After his father died in 1887, Wilhelm ran the company itself, developing and modernizing it: in 1897 it became a joint stock company, with representations in Berlin, Magdeburg and Cologne, exporting abroad to China, United States and Africa. His high income (approx. 55-60 thousand marks a year) allowed him to donate for social and charity, as well as funding the construction of his stately villa.|$|E
5000|$|Doane {{attended}} the Woodstock Academy, a private secondary school {{affiliated with the}} Congregational church and located in Woodstock, Connecticut. His musical talents enabled him {{to serve as the}} school’s choir director. Upon graduation in 1848, Doane went to work in the accounting section of his father’s company. From there he moved to J. A. Fay & Company, a <b>woodworking</b> <b>machinery</b> company, for a long career leading to the company’s presidency. [...] On November 2, 1857 Doane married Mary Frances Treat, the daughter of his father’s partner in their cotton manufacturing business.|$|E
