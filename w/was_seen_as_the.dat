5|$|Doudna also {{proposes that}} Hyrcanus II <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Teacher of Righteousness. According to Doudna, Hyrcanus II’s sectarian {{orientation}} is now generally understood {{to have been}} Sadducee; whereas Antigonus was more sympathetic towards the Pharisees.|$|E
5|$|The {{game with}} Rose Polytechnic <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> first {{real test of}} the season.

50|$|Non-state market-driven {{methods are}} often used because of {{allegations}} of ‘state failure’ in managing the environment. In the neoliberal view, market based methods <b>are</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> one of <b>the</b> most effective and efficient ways to meet environmental goals. <b>The</b> market <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> key mechanism for producing the maximum social good and governance networks <b>are</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> {{most efficient way to}} regulate environmental concerns.|$|R
5|$|Among the insects, in both Japan and Europe, as {{far back}} as ancient Greece and Rome, a {{butterfly}} <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> personification of a person's soul, both while they were alive and after their death. The scarab beetle was sacred in ancient Egypt, while the praying mantis was considered a god in southern African Khoi and San tradition for its praying posture.|$|E
5|$|As it {{had been}} two decades since much silver was {{regularly}} deposited for striking into coins, {{the fact that the}} United States had been on a bimetallic standard since 1792 was often forgotten. The gold standard <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> only possible choice, and many people assumed that the United States was on that standard, which had been adopted by strong nations like the United Kingdom (1816) and the German Empire (1871).|$|E
5|$|As {{well as an}} {{operational}} aircraft carrier, Melbourne was Flagship of the RAN, a role she received almost immediately following her 1956 arrival in Australia, and fulfilled until her decommissioning in 1982. During her service, the carrier was deployed overseas on 35 occasions, visited over 22 countries, and <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> physical and psychological centrepiece of the RAN fleet.|$|E
5000|$|In Tamil, {{the word}} vel means spear that <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> weapon of Hindu god Murugan and oor means place.

50|$|From this perspective, small black-owned {{businesses}} <b>are</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> “ghetto domestic sector,” white-owned {{businesses that}} operate within <b>the</b> internal colonies <b>are</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> “ghetto enclave sector,” {{and the black}} laborers that work outside <b>the</b> community <b>are</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> “ghetto labor-export sector” (Bailey 1973:62). The idea of a black internal colony makes it especially notable that the Jim Crow era was brought to a close {{not only by the}} internal influences of the civil rights movement, but also from external pressures brought by international trading partners and decolonized developing nations (Cable & Mix 2003:198).|$|R

5|$|Because Baltimore's {{electorate}} {{is overwhelmingly}} Democratic, whoever won the Democratic primary election <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> favorite over the Republican nominee {{in the general}} election. Baltimore's large African American population initially made it seem likely that the next mayor would also be African American. Kweisi Mfume was the preferred candidate of local politicians, but he opted not to run. Though Carl Stokes and Lawrence Bell, members of the City Council, declared for the race, local leaders were underwhelmed {{with the quality of}} declared candidates.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{participation}} of the three Smolensk regiments, Russians saw the battle as a victory of a Polish–Lithuanian–Russian coalition against invading Germans. Chronicler Jan Długosz praised the Smolensk banners, who fought bravely and were the only banners from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania not to retreat. In Soviet historiography, the Battle of Grunwald was styled as a racial struggle between Slavs and Germanics. The Teutonic Knights were portrayed as the medieval forerunners of Hitler's armies, while the battle itself <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> medieval counterpart to the Battle of Stalingrad.|$|E
5|$|Georgia Tech {{had entered}} into {{the main part of}} its {{schedule}} after three dominating wins. Upcoming engagements with Vanderbilt, Pittsburgh, and Centre were said to determine the season's outcome. Pittsburgh and Centre–but Pittsburgh especially, were the biggest opponents. Vanderbilt <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> warm up act to these two, for it was far superior to any of Tech's prior games. The first game of the year to have direct implications for the Southern championship, it was cited by some as the most interesting southern contest of the week.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, 350 veterans, politicians, and {{soldiers}} representing the division went to Normandy and Paris, in France for the 60th {{anniversary of the}} D-Day landings. The Army National Guard organized a major ceremony for the 60th anniversary, {{as many of the}} veterans who participated in the invasion were in their 80s at that time, and the 60th anniversary <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> last major anniversary of the landings in which a large number of veterans could take part.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} leading up to the race, Secretariat <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> {{favorite}} to win by many; however there were doubts about him following a third-place finish at the Wood Memorial Stakes two weeks prior to the Derby. In the wake of Secretariat's loss, Angle Light and, in particular, Sham were the horses that were seen as the most likely to win the Derby, aside from Secretariat. Many sportswriters believed that the horses in the field possessed great speed and thought the course record would be broken.|$|E
5|$|Kommandøren {{was one of}} four passenger/cargo steamships {{built for}} Nordre Bergenhus Amts Dampskibe at Norwegian shipyards {{around the turn of the}} 20th century. The four ships were {{constructed}} to supplement four smaller vessels built decades earlier at British shipyards. In addition to Kommandøren, which <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> flagship of the company's fleet, Lærdal, Balder and Stavenes were built between 1876 and 1904. The company sailed on cargo/passenger routes in Western Norway. Kommandøren was the largest of the new-builds, and was considered the grandest of the company vessels.|$|E

5|$|Numerous {{meetings}} and conferences of discontented workers continued across the country. A committee representing the strikers (including engineers, conductors, firemen, and brakemen) departed Baltimore to ensure solidarity along the line in demanding $2 per hour. According to the edition of July 20 of The Sun, the city was peaceful, but anxious, as many awaited word of the happenings in Martinsburg, which <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> central point of the movement.|$|E
5|$|Swedish {{debate about}} America {{remained}} mostly theoretical before the 19th century, since very few Swedes had any personal {{experience of the}} nation. Emigration was illegal and population <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> wealth of nations. However, the Swedish population doubled between 1750 and 1850, and as population growth outstripped economic development, it gave rise to fears of overpopulation based on the influential population theory of Thomas Malthus. In the 1830s, the laws against emigration were repealed.|$|E
5|$|As the {{economic}} situation kept deteriorating and the regime avoided implementation of the agreed reforms, the government and Solidarity representatives met in early August to discuss the outstanding issues. The talks ended in disagreement. During a conference of Solidarity's National Commission (a central representative policy making body) that followed, Modzelewski, Kuroń and others proposed a democratic transformation and practical arrangements by which the Union would take upon itself a major political role, participating in governing the country, accepting responsibility for the outcome and keeping social peace, thus relieving the (still) ruling party {{of some of its}} burdens. Such a deal <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> only constructive way forward, but it would require government partners interested in a negotiated solution.|$|E

5|$|By 1942, {{most of the}} {{differences}} between politicians in occupied Poland and those in exile had been positively settled. By 1943, the PKP had evolved into the Home Political Representation (Krajowa Reprezentacja Polityczna, KRP), which served as the basis of the Council of National Unity (Rada Jedności Narodowej, RJN), created on 9 January 1944. The Council, headed by Kazimierz Pużak, <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Underground State's parliament. Meanwhile, the military arm of the Underground State expanded dramatically, and the ZWZ was transformed into Armia Krajowa (AK, or the Home Army) in 1942. ZWZ-AK commanders included Stefan Rowecki, Tadeusz Komorowski and Leopold Okulicki.|$|E
5|$|Culverhouse was {{initially}} lauded for bringing professional football to the Tampa Bay area, but eventually {{came to be}} blamed for the team's struggles. His refusal to pay Doug Williams at a salary level {{comparable to that of}} the league's top quarterbacks insulted fans, and <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> beginning of the team's decline during the 1980s. It further led to the belief that Culverhouse was unconcerned with fielding a winning team, {{as long as it was}} financially profitable. The Buccaneers' NFL-record streak of fourteen consecutive losing seasons cemented this perception, although Culverhouse did make several notable attempts to improve the team.|$|E
5|$|During {{the later}} nineteenth century, Megalosaurus <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> typical {{carnivorous}} dinosaur. If remains were found {{that were not}} deemed sufficiently distinct to warrant a separate genus, often single teeth, these were classified under Megalosaurus, which thus began {{to function as a}} wastebasket taxon, a sort of default genus. Eventually, Megalosaurus contained more species than any other non-avian dinosaur genus, most of them of dubious validity. During the twentieth century, this practice was gradually discontinued; but scientists discovering theropods that had been mistakenly classified under a different animal group in older literature, still felt themselves forced to rename them, again choosing Megalosaurus as the default generic name.|$|E
