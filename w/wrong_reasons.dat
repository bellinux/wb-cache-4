5|$|George Graham managed Millwall from 1983 to 1986, {{and during}} that time he guided the club to a Football League Group Cup win, beating Lincoln City 3–2 in the final in the 1982–83 season. The 1984–85 season was {{particularly}} successful, Millwall reached the FA Cup quarter-finals and gained promotion to the Second Division, going unbeaten at home again in Division Three, winning 18 games and drawing five. In the FA Cup they were beaten 1–0 by First Division Luton Town at Kenilworth Road. The match is remembered for all the <b>wrong</b> <b>reasons,</b> after hooligans rioted at the game. 81 people (including 31 police officers) were injured in the disturbances.|$|E
5|$|Adam and Rachel (James Nesbitt and Helen Baxendale), and Karen and David (Hermione Norris and Robert Bathurst) {{arrive in}} Sydney, Australia for Pete and Jo's (John Thomson and Kimberley Joseph) hastily {{arranged}} wedding. Jo's father Rod Ellison (Gary Sweet) is {{surprised to learn}} that his daughter is getting married to a man he suspects is only after his money. After speaking to Rod, Adam tells Pete that he thinks the wedding is going ahead for the <b>wrong</b> <b>reasons.</b> Pete reacts angrily and tells Adam to forget being his best man. The following morning, Rod tries to bribe Pete to call off the wedding, but Pete declines. He later overhears Rod forbidding Jo to marry him and tells her they ought to postpone the wedding. Jo is devastated at his decision, and tells him to get out of her house. She confides her sorrow in her ex-fiancé Shawn (Sandy Winton), who unsuccessfully tries to restart their relationship by proposing to her.|$|E
5|$|Lindqvist {{had insisted}} on writing the {{screenplay}} himself. Alfredson, who had no familiarity with the vampire and horror genres, initially expressed skepticism at having the original author do the adaptation, but found the end result very satisfying. Many of the minor characters and events from the book were removed, and focus directed primarily on the love story between the two leads. In particular, {{many aspects of the}} character Håkan, including him being a paedophile, were toned down, and his relationship with Eli was mostly left open to interpretation. Alfredson felt that the film could not deal with such a serious theme as pedophilia in a satisfying manner, and that this element would detract from the story of the children and their relationship. Still, the film provided a few hints, of which Alfredson mentions one in the director's comments (Håkan likes children, for the <b>wrong</b> <b>reasons).</b>|$|E

25|$|Clarke's {{spending}} {{had left}} Leeds in a precarious financial situation, and Gray {{was forced to}} concentrate on youth development to rebuild the team. Gray had no {{money to spend on}} team building, and those players he developed were often sold off as well.

25|$|Ball's tenure saw City {{narrowly}} avoid relegation by finishing 20th in 1991–92 and 19th in 1992–93. In December 1992, {{part of the}} floodlights failed {{with just}} six minutes left in City's home FA Cup game against Swansea City. The Grecians were losing 2-1 at the time, and when the referee tried to restart the match with {{only half of the}} floodlights working, City fans invaded the pitch and sat in the goalmouth. Once they were removed, the match restarted once more, only for the floodlights to fail one minute later; after which the match was abandoned. City lost the rescheduled match 5-2. City again made the headlines at the end the 1992–93 season, this time for all the <b>wrong</b> <b>reasons.</b> In the penultimate game of the season, City needed a win against Port Vale to avoid relegation. City were leading 1-0, but referee Bob Hamer awarded Port Vale a controversial penalty in stoppage time. The penalty was converted and, after the final whistle, City supporters invaded the pitch, the referee was knocked to the ground and one of the linesmen was assaulted. Manager Alan Ball also ran onto the pitch to remonstrate with Hamer and had to be pulled away by his backroom staff.

40|$|Reservoir {{characterization}} {{and modeling}} almost always faces {{a problem of}} lack of data, as core and well-log data are limited. This problem, while serious, can be often mitigated by using a geologic conceptual model interpreted from 3 D seismic data, outcrop analogues, comparison with contemporary sedimentation and choosing appropriate methods to reconcile the inconsistencies in the available data and to realistically predict reservoir properties. This is called inference to the best explanation or abductive reasoning by science philosophers. However, {{with the lack of}} the direct information of the subsurface, even the best geologic inference contains uncertainty, which explains why uncertainty and risk analysis has received significant attention of geoscientists in the last decade or so. Uncertainty analysis and reservoir modeling involves many disciplines, including geology, geophysics, petrophysics and reservoir engineering. In this paper, error types associated with uncertainty analysis in reservoir characterization and modeling will be discussed, including Type I error or false positives (such as drilling dry holes), Type II error or false negatives (such as underestimations of subsurface resources, and farming out a prolific reservoir), Type III error or correct positives for the <b>wrong</b> <b>reason</b> (such as correct estimate of resources by overestimating pore space and underestimating hydrocarbon saturation) and Type IV error or correct negatives for the <b>wrong</b> <b>reason.</b> Examples for these error types will be given, and their analysis will provide insights for better uncertainty evaluation in reservoi...|$|R
