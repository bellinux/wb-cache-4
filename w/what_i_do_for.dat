2500|$|Randi {{has been}} accused of {{actually}} using [...] "psychic powers" [...] to perform acts such as spoon bending. According to James Alcock, at a meeting where Randi was duplicating the performances of Uri Geller, a professor from the University at Buffalo shouted out that Randi was a fraud. Randi said: [...] "Yes, indeed, I'm a trickster, I'm a cheat, I'm a charlatan, that's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> a living. Everything I've done here was by trickery." [...] The professor shouted back: [...] "That's not what I mean. You're a fraud because you're pretending to do these things through trickery, but you're actually using psychic powers and misleading us by not admitting it." [...] A similar event involved Senator Claiborne Pell, a confirmed believer in psychic phenomena. When Randi personally demonstrated to Pell that he could reveal—by simple trickery—a concealed drawing that had been secretly made by the senator, Pell refused to believe that it was a trick, saying: [...] "I think Randi may be a psychic and doesn't realize it." [...] Randi has consistently denied having any paranormal powers or abilities.|$|E

2500|$|After filming {{ended on}} the series Mercy Peak, Bartolomei {{decided he would}} stay in New Zealand rather than {{returning}} to Australia and was offered {{the role of a}} new character – Craig Valentine on Shortland Street, who was set to undergo a steamy romance with the upcoming character Sarah Potts. Bartolomei decided to leave the soap in 2008, saying, [...] "It was a very difficult decision, from an actor's point of view it's not very often that you have the security that a job like Shortland Street provides. But after {{four and a half years}} I longed for a degree of anonymity again. I'm a very private person, and given <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> a job, the spectre of Shortland Street will invariably take that away from you." [...] The character was killed off in a dramatic gang storyline, something which producers at first thought would be [...] "unforgivable" [...] but which, due to Bartolomei's iinsistence on leaving, they went through with. Bartolomei said of the storyline, [...] "It's all a bit of fun and it's nice to see the characters away from the normal hospital setting and involved in something a little bit different," [...] and of the conclusion to Sarah and Craig's romance, [...] "That does get revisited but not in a stereotypical way.

6000|$|It came to Herbert as he {{left the}} place a shade less remarkable--though there was still wonder enough and to spare--that he had been even {{publicly}} and designedly sacrificed; exactly so that, as the door closed behind him, Kate Cookham, standing there to wait for it, could seem to say, across the room, to the friend of her youth, only by the expression of her fine eyes: [...] "There--see <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> you!"

6000|$|It is very true, however, {{that during}} this early period {{he seems to}} have been very glad to do {{whatever}} came to his hand. Certain of his tales found their way into one of the annuals of the time, a publication endowed with the brilliant title of The Boston Token and Atlantic Souvenir. The editor of this graceful repository was S. G. Goodrich, a gentleman who, I suppose, may be called one of the pioneers of American periodical literature. He is better known to the world as Mr. Peter Parley, a name under which he produced a multitude of popular school-books, story-books, and other attempts to vulgarize human knowledge and adapt it to the infant mind. This enterprising purveyor of literary wares appears, incongruously enough, to have been Hawthorne's earliest protector, if protection is the proper word for the treatment that the young author received from him. Mr. Goodrich induced him in 1836 to go to Boston to edit a periodical in which he was interested, The American Magazine of Useful and Entertaining Knowledge. I have never seen the work in question, but Hawthorne's biographer gives a sorry account of it. It was managed by the so-called Bewick Company, which [...] "took its name from Thomas Bewick, the English restorer of the art of wood-engraving, and the magazine was to do his memory honour by his admirable illustrations. But in fact it never did any one honour, nor brought any one profit. It was a penny popular affair, containing condensed information about innumerable subjects, no fiction, and little poetry. The woodcuts were of the crudest and most frightful sort. It passed through the hands of several editors and several publishers. Hawthorne was engaged at a salary of five hundred dollars a year; but it appears that he got next to nothing, and did not stay in the position long." [...] Hawthorne wrote from Boston in the winter of 1836: [...] "I came here trusting to Goodrich's positive promise to pay me forty-five dollars as soon as I arrived; and he has kept promising from one day to another, till I do not see that he means to pay at all. I have now broke off all intercourse with him, and never think of going near him.... I don't feel at all obliged to him about the editorship, for he is a stockholder and director in the Bewick Company ... and I defy them to get another to do for a thousand dollars, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> five hundred."--"I make nothing," [...] he says in another letter, [...] "of writing a history or biography before dinner." [...] Goodrich proposed to him to write a Universal History for the use of schools, offering him a hundred dollars for his share in the work. Hawthorne accepted the offer and took a hand--I know not how large a one--in the job. His biographer has been able to identify a single phrase as our author's. He is speaking of George IV: [...] "Even when he was quite a young man this King cared as much about dress as any young coxcomb. He {{had a great deal of}} taste in such matters, and it is a pity that he was a King, for he might otherwise have made an excellent tailor." [...] The Universal History had a great vogue and passed through hundreds of editions; but it does not appear that Hawthorne ever received more than his hundred dollars. The writer of these pages vividly remembers making its acquaintance at an early stage of his education--a very fat, stumpy-looking book, bound in boards covered with green paper, and having in the text very small woodcuts, of the most primitive sort. He associates it to this day with the names of Sesostris and Semiramis whenever he encounters them, there having been, he supposes, some account of the conquests of these potentates that would impress itself upon the imagination of a child. At the end of four months, Hawthorne had received but twenty dollars--four pounds--for his editorship of the American Magazine.|$|E
