25|$|Smartism centers its worship {{simultaneously}} on all {{the major}} Hindu deities: Shiva, Vishnu, Shakti, Ganesha, Surya and Skanda. The Smarta tradition developed during the (early) Classical Period of Hinduism around {{the beginning of the}} Common Era, when Hinduism emerged from the interaction between Brahmanism and local traditions. The Smarta tradition is aligned with Advaita Vedanta, and regards Adi Shankara as its founder or reformer, who considered worship of God-with-attributes (saguna Brahman) as a journey towards ultimately realizing God-without-attributes (nirguna Brahman, Atman, Self-knowledge). The term Smartism is derived from Smriti texts of Hinduism, meaning those <b>who</b> <b>remember</b> the traditions in the texts. This Hindu sect practices a philosophical Jnana yoga, scriptural studies, reflection, meditative path seeking an understanding of Self's oneness with God.|$|E

Trying to convince Batman (Dick Grayson), Booster is horrified to learn that, thanks to Max, the world believes Ted Kord committed suicide. Fire, Ice, and Captain Atom are soon set up by Max to cut them off from allies, but, ironically, Booster is left alone because his reputation is already poor.|$|E

As Marlowe and Chess walk over the property, they discover a drowned body that Chess identifies as his wife, bloated from decomposition and almost unrecognisable except by her clothes and jewellery. Chess is immediately arrested for his wife's murder, and Marlowe, doubtful of Chess's guilt, returns to Los Angeles. Before he returns, Marlowe interviews some hotel employees <b>who</b> <b>remember</b> a woman matching Crystal's description and volunteer that a man was with her; their description of the man is similar to that of Lavery.|$|E

Even though this move was welcomed by many long time supporters <b>who</b> <b>remember</b> the original motives of the Nick Tana led consortium in the mid 1990s to purchase the naming and livery rights and all other historical assets related to the oldest (albeit with a non-continuous history) Western Australian football club, Perth City FC, resulting in being rebuffed at the final minute, this was still not a popular move amongst the bulk of paid-up Perth Glory members who have grown accustomed to the current name and colours thus closing the door on any popular compromise. Thankfully for said members, the new ownership triumvirate consisting of Messrs Sage, Spence and McKeon stated that the colours will certainly not be changed under their reign.|$|E

American Jews <b>who</b> <b>remember</b> using the Maxwell House Haggadah in their childhood homes consider it a tradition, continuing to use it at their own families' Passover Seders. In 1997 the Hallmark company reproduced the familiar blue cover of the Maxwell House Haggadahs on one of its Passover greeting cards, which described them as [...] "cultural iconsprized family possessions that have been handed down through the generations and are a warm reminder of the past".|$|E
500|$|Writer and {{academic}} Mike Gonzalez believes the ensemble provoked a backward glance to [...] "timeless, sensual places where dreams and desire merged in a comfortable, evocative music". Gonzalez {{asserts that the}} aura evoked did not represent [...] "the real Cuba" [...] before the revolution of 1959, nor Cuba in the modern era, but that the Cuban government were happy for the tourist industry to [...] "enjoy the fruits of this confusion". The American Historical Review suggested that the Buena Vista Social Clubs mise en scène fueled nostalgic, idealistic feelings not only of many Americans and Cubans in the United States <b>who</b> <b>remember</b> the Havana of the 1950s, but also of Cubans in Cuba. The result was a reminiscence about the pre-revolutionary era—dominated by the politics of Gerardo Machado in the 1920s–30s and then General Fulgencio Batista until 1959—which [...] "no longer seems so bad".|$|E

500|$|Kneale {{had brought}} Quatermass's story {{to a close}} in the 1979 serial Quatermass, and for many years {{saw no reason to}} revisit the character. However, in 1995 he was {{approached}} by BBC radio producer Paul Quinn with an idea for creating a drama-documentary about the character as part of a season of BBC radio programming looking back at the 1950s. Quinn told Dreamwatch magazine, [...] "For many people <b>who</b> <b>remember</b> the seminal experience of hiding behind the sofa when the Quatermass serials came on the television, Quatermass was the 1950s. His adventures [...] have gone down in popular cultural history." [...] Kneale was intrigued by the idea, and agreed to write new dramatic material of Quatermass relating his memories which Quinn could then combine with archive clips from the existing episodes of the various Quatermass television serials. Kneale saw the older Quatermass of this new serial as [...] "the same very concerned scientist who is now, in retrospect, horribly worried about what he may have done to the world through his encounters with various lifeforms that were better not contacted". It was Kneale's first radio work since he had written the play You Must Listen for the BBC in 1952, and his first work for the BBC in any medium since the mid-1970s.|$|E
500|$|Brundage leaves an {{uncertain}} legacy. On {{the question of}} amateurism, Maraniss suggests that Brundage was [...] "caught in a vise" [...] between communist and capitalist states pursuing dissimilar goals; nations following either system were not willing to accept Brundage's vision of pure amateurism, and broke those rules, each system in its own way. Guttmann notes that in the 1960s, Brundage may have been better-known as an art collector than for his sports activities, and [...] "there are those who maintain {{that he will be}} remembered not for his career in sports but for his jades and bronzes." [...] Andrew Leigh, a Member of the Australian House of Representatives, criticizes Brundage for expelling the two athletes in Mexico City, calling him [...] "a man who'd had no difficulty with the Nazi salute being used in the 1936 Olympics". Dick Pound believes Brundage to {{have been one of the}} IOC's great presidents, along with deCoubertin and Samaranch, but concedes that by the end of his term, Brundage was out of touch with the world of sports. While Pound credits Brundage with holding the Olympic movement together in a period when it was beset by many challenges, he notes that this might not be fully appreciated by those <b>who</b> <b>remember</b> Brundage for the final years of his term, and for Munich.|$|E

Sandra Hall, writing for The Sydney Morning Herald, gave the film {{three and a half}} out of five stars, believing that [...] "Hartley's own film is much livelier than most of those he is out to celebrate". Jake Wilson of The Age similarly gave the film three and a half stars, but called the film [...] "basically a feature-length advertisement for its subject", saying that it [...] "moves far too rapidly to permit sustained analysis". The Courier-Mails Des Partidge, who gave the film four and a half out of five stars, disagreed, saying that [...] "Brisk editing means the history is lively and fun", and claimed in homage to The Castle, [...] "Copies of Hartley's film should go straight to pool rooms all over Australia when it becomes available on DVD." [...] Luke Goodsell of Empire Magazine Australasia gave Not Quite Hollywood five out of five stars, calling the film [...] "fast, thrilling and often ribald", while Leigh Paatsch wrote for the Herald Sun that [...] "there is not a single instant where boredom can possibly intrude", dubbing the film [...] "an incredibly energetic and merrily messed-up celebration of Australian B-movies".|$|E
