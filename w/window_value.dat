30|$|We first {{calculate}} {{the range of}} the given data (by subtracting minimum from maximum value). Next, we divide the range into very small sub-ranges called chunks. Each and every element in the data must belong to one of the chunks. We then form a window with a group of chunks (e.g., window of size 2 indicates two chunks in the window). Once a window is defined, we perform sliding window operation over the range of values. In each position of the window (covering a group of chunks equal to its size), we determine the number of elements present in the window as well as the total sum of all those element values. The average <b>window</b> <b>value</b> is computed by dividing the total sum by the number of elements.

The common window method can take dose variation. focus error, mask critical dimension error and aberrations into account. However, the demerit of the common window method is its computation time. In this paper, a new metric called Normalized Process Latitude (NPL) is proposed. The NPL considers dose variation, focus error, mask critical dimension error and aberrations to output its fmal quantification value. Its processing time for quantifying one feature is usually within 10 seconds on a PC with 1 GHz CPU and 256 MB DRAM.

3000|$|BEB-based {{carrier sense}} {{multiple}} access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) {{is the most}} basic and widely used mechanism for MAC protocol. In WPAN MAC, if the channel is idle for backoff interframe space (BIFS) or short interframe space (SIFS) the DEV starts executing the BEB scheme. At each packet transmission, the backoff counter is uniformly selected from the given range of [0, CW- 1] (in rest of the paper we keep using terms [...] "DEV" [...] and [...] "node" [...] interchangeably). Here, CW is known as contention window and its value depends on the number of failed transmissions for the packet. At the first transmission attempt, CW is set to minimum value of 8 and if transmission attempt fails then its value gets double, and again set to minimum value on successful transmission. In WPAN MAC, the maximum contention <b>window</b> <b>value</b> is set to 64 with the maximum retry limit up to 3 counts.

Many closed-form {{critical condition}}s for various control schemes in terms of converter parameters are also derived. Some previously known critical conditions become special cases in the generalized framework. Given an arbitrary control scheme, a systematic procedure is proposed to derive the critical condition for that control scheme. Different control schemes share similar forms of critical conditions. For example, both V 2 control and voltage mode control have the same form of critical condition.

40|$|Abstract — Object {{detection}} is {{a crucial}} step in visual surveillance. Traditionally, object detection has been performed purely in software in surveillance systems. The problem of object detection, however, becomes critical in the upcoming wireless visual sensors because of size and power constraints. The need for low-power, small size, hardware implementations is greatly felt. This paper introduces a VLSI architecture for Wronskian Change Detector (WCD). Object detection is done through background subtraction. WCD offers regularity, low complexity and accuracy as well as global illumination changes independency. WCD can be employed in automated visual surveillance on buildings and adjacent parking lots. WCD replaces each pixel by a vector containing luminance value of the pixel and its surrounding area. A linear dependency test is applied to each vector {{to determine if a}} change has occurred. WCD is mapped into a 12 – Processing Element array with a fixed <b>window</b> <b>value</b> of 3 × 3. Design of each processing element is discussed in detail. Based on extensive search, no VLSI implementation of WCD has been reported previously I...|$|E
40|$|Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease (AIMD) is {{a widely}} used {{congestion}} control algorithm that {{is known to be}} fair and efficient in utilizing the network resources. In this paper, we revisit the performance of the AIMD algorithm under realistic conditions by extending the seminal model of Chui. We show that under realistic conditions the fairness and efficiency of AIMD is sensitive to changes in network conditions. Surprisingly, the root cause of this sensitivity comes from the way the congestion window is rounded during a multiplicative decrease phase. For instance, the floor function is often used to round the congestion <b>window</b> <b>value</b> because either kernel implementations or protocol restrictions mandate to use integers to maintain system variables. To solve the sensitivity issue, we provide a simple solution that is to alternatively use the floor and ceiling functions in the computation of the congestion window during a multiplicative decrease phase, when the congestion window size is an odd number. We observe that with our solution the efficiency improves and the fairness becomes one order of magnitude less sensitive to changes in network conditions...|$|E
