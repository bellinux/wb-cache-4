25|$|The Duke de Broglie was {{carefully}} preparing {{a way to}} bring down Thiers. He modified the rules of the Assembly so that the President had the power to veto laws passed by the Assembly, but also requiring that the President ask permission from the head of the Assembly before he spoke to the body. On 2 April, the moderate republican president of the Assembly, Jules Grévy, was forced to resign by a personal scandal and was replaced by a deputy of the center-right, Buffet, who supported a constitutional monarchy. Soon afterwards, on 27 April, an election was held in Paris to fill a vacant seat in the Assembly. Both the candidate of the monarchists and the moderate republican candidate supported by Thiers was defeated by a more radical republican named Barodet, who was supported by Leon Gambetta and the left wing of the republicans. Further elections were held on 11 May: five of the six open seats were won by republicans. The right wing of the Assembly became alarmed that the country was moving too far to the left and decided it <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rid of Thiers.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of November 7 Goreham decided that it <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a message to Windsor. He sent a party of men down to the dock that morning. [...] These men, {{numbering}} about 30, were taken prisoner by Eddy's men as rapidly as they arrived due to their unawareness that Eddy had control of the ship. The Polly was then sailed to Fort Lawrence, {{to the east of}} Fort Cumberland, where the supplies were landed. [...] Sentries in the fort spotted the move, and Goreham, realizing Eddy had taken the ship, fired an ineffectual cannonade against the ship.|$|E
500|$|In the 1953–54 NBA season, the now 29-year-old Mikan slowly declined, {{averaging}} 18.1 points, 14.3 {{rebounds and}} 2.4 assists per game. Under his leadership, the Lakers won another NBA {{title in the}} 1954 NBA Finals, making it their third-straight championship and fifth in six years; the only time they lost had been when Mikan fractured his leg. From an NBA perspective, the Minneapolis Lakers dynasty has only been convincingly surpassed by the eleven-title Boston Celtics dynasty of 1957–69. At {{the end of the}} season, Mikan announced his retirement. He later said: [...] "I had a family growing, and I decided to be with them. I felt it <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> started with the professional world outside of basketball." [...] Injuries also were a factor, as Mikan had sustained 10 broken bones and 16 stitches in his career, often having to play through these injuries.|$|E

500|$|Solo {{played in}} 22 WPS matches in 2010 {{for both the}} Athletica and the Beat and was the league-leader in saves with 104. The two-time WPS All-Star also ranked among the top three in shutouts (6), wins (6), and goals against average (1.64). After {{the end of the}} 2010 season, Solo {{underwent}} surgery on her right shoulder on September 22. [...] "These next two years are huge for the national team with the World Cup and Olympics on the horizon and I {{wanted to make sure that}} I would be giving my team and my country my best on the field," [...] Solo said of the surgery. [...] "I've been having some painful issues with the shoulder for a while and for a goalkeeper it's been difficult physically and mentally to play with this kind of an injury, so it <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it taken care of." ...|$|E
500|$|In late 1942, Como {{made the}} {{decision}} to quit the Weems band, even if it meant giving up singing. He returned to Canonsburg, his family, and his trade, tired of life on the road without his wife and young son. Como received an offer to become a Frank Sinatra imitator, but chose to keep his own style. While Perry was negotiating for a store lease to re-open a barber shop, he received a call from Tommy Rockwell at General Artists Corporation, who also represented Ted Weems. Como fielded many other calls that also brought offers, but he liked and trusted Rockwell, who was offering him his own sustaining (non-sponsored) Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) radio show and offering to get him a recording contract. The offers were also appealing because it meant staying in New York with no more road tours. As Perry pondered the job offer, Roselle told him, [...] "You can always get another barber shop if it doesn't work out!" [...] Until the radio show and recording contract offers, he did not really view singing as his career, believing the years with Carlone and Weems had been enjoyable, but now it <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back to work. Como said in an 1983 interview, [...] "I thought I'd have my fun and I'd go home to work." ...|$|E
500|$|Another major rivalry {{heading into}} the event was between Shawn Michaels and Chris Masters. This feud began the night after SummerSlam, where Michaels lost a match to Hulk Hogan. Michaels {{admitted}} he fell victim to Hogan's leg drop, a move where Hogan drops his legs across the opponent's head or chest. He concluded that Hogan was the better man and it <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> [...] "back to reality". Midway through Michaels' speech, Masters interrupted him and informed Michaels that individuals like Hogan and Michaels {{did not know how}} to pass the torch to new wrestlers. Michaels went along with Masters' comments and warned Masters to not group him with Hogan. Masters concluded by stating that he was not [...] "trying" [...] to steal the spotlight from Michaels, but that he was going to [...] "take it". Michaels responded by saying that he knew where Masters was coming from, which led to Michaels slapping Masters. The two then brawled, thus turning Michaels into an on-screen hero, as he had been a villain in rivalry between Hogan. On the September 5 episode of Raw, Michaels was involved in the Masterlock Challenge, a challenge where the wrestler must break free from Master's full Nelson submission hold, which he calls the Master Lock. Despite Michaels' best efforts, he could not break free. Upset at the vigorous resistance of Michaels, Masters released the hold and hit Michaels with a steel chair before re-applying the hold. The following week, Michaels issued a challenge to Masters at Unforgiven, in which he vowed to get revenge on Masters for his actions the previous week.|$|E

2500|$|Kennedy later {{claimed he}} {{understood}} that the rampant stock speculation of the late 1920s {{would lead to a}} market crash. Supposedly, he said that he knew it <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out of the market when he received stock tips from a shoe-shine boy. Kennedy survived the crash [...] "because he possessed a passion for facts, a complete lack of sentiment and a marvelous sense of timing".|$|E

2500|$|He {{moved to}} Funny Car in 1980 and 1981 and had three final-round loses. He used Mike Kase's Dodge Omni at the 1981 World Finals {{to set a}} {{national}} record with a 5.891second pass to break Bernstein's 5.90 mark. During the 1981 season, he had two accidents. Armstrong described the fiery 240mph crash of his Dodge Challenger at Columbus, Ohio: [...] "Yeah, {{that was kind of}} a bad one," [...] he said.

2500|$|... “The {{last time}} I saw Eric Hollies bat at Birmingham,” {{recalled}} Jack Fingleton in 1958, “he was clapped and cheered {{all the way}} to the middle at No. 11. Everybody knew there would be no pretty passes at the ball and deft deflections from Eric. They knew that if he could only survive two balls they would see something in batting unknown to any textbook.” Bateman added, “when it <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> his pads on, Eric would prop his bat up in the Edgbaston dressing room window and say to it: ‘Now while I’m getting ready, you find out what the ball’s doing’”.|$|E
2500|$|Tonic went on hiatus {{beginning}} in 2004, all three members {{began working on}} other projects unrelated to Tonic. Hart released a solo album entitled Cigarettes and Gasoline on July 17, 2007. Russo {{became part of the}} band Low Stars, who released a self-titled CD in 2007. Lavery did song writing for projects including the feature-length movies The Passion of the Christ and Elektra, and began playing bass on tour for The Fray in March 2007. Commenting on this time period, Russo said, [...] "It wasn’t like we broke the band up. Everyone just went to their own corner and did their own thing. We figured when it <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back together it will happen." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 2 November 1917 Fred Billington {{travelled}} from Cambridge, {{where the}} Company was then playing, to London {{to have lunch}} in a hotel with Rupert Carte himself. [...] It was a convivial but not necessarily the happiest of occasions. [...] Carte had decided that, however sad it might be, the fact {{could no longer be}} disguised that Billington was now over the hill and that {{the time had come to}} ask him to retire; and towards the end of that lunch, it seems, he broke it to him that the current tour would be his last. [...] After they had finished the meal Carte departed. [...] Billington remained, chatting and reminiscing with one of the hotel waiters. [...] Eventually, remarking that it <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back to the safety of Cambridge – [...] "we've not had any Zeppelins there" [...] – he rose, walked towards the hotel exit, and dropped dead.|$|E

2500|$|At {{around one}} o'clock one morning I {{returned}} to the Windsor Hotel in Melbourne to the staggering sight of Ken Barrington sitting alone in the lounge drinking whisky. The Test match was critically poised and Barrington, invariably an early-to-bed man in a crisis, was a portrait of gloom. He was batting {{first thing in the}} morning and couldn't sleep. He returned to bed, tossed and turned for another hour until, in desperation, he committed the capital offence of telephoning the manager's room. The Duke, a chronic insomaniac had a supply of sleeping pills so powerful that the average recipient would remain oblivious to nuclear attack. In the name of England, Barrington was determined to get his hands on them. [...] "Damn you, Barrington" [...] roared the Duke, [...] "I had only just got to sleep myself." [...] Then, relenting, he said [...] "All right, come and get them". In the same moment that Barrington's hand replaced the receiver his head hit the pillow and he fell into exhausted unconsciousness. The Duke waited and waited. He was still awake when dawn exploded into dazzling sunshine and it <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> up.|$|E
2500|$|After the war, the {{political}} {{forces in the}} country began encroaching on Georgescu. Before and during the war, Romania had already passed through three successive dictatorships, and the fourth one was now at hand. Plenty of items on Georgescu's track record were suitable for antagonising both the native Romanian communists and the Soviet authorities that still occupied the country: His top membership of the Peasants' Party, in open opposition to the Communist Party; his chief negotiating position in the Armistice Commission, defending Romania's sovereignty against the occupying power; and his earlier affiliation with capitalist US as a Rockefeller research fellow at Harvard University. Political repression in the country intensified as the rise to power of the communists was completing, and Georgescu finally realised it <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> away: [...] "... I had to flee Romania before I was thrown into a jail from which {{no one has ever}} come out alive." [...] By the aid of the Jewish community — he had earlier risked his neck by helping the Jews during the Romanian part of the Holocaust — Georgescu and his wife got hold of counterfeit identity cards that secured them the passage out of the country, surrounded by bribed smugglers and stowed away in the hold of a freight ship heading for Turkey.|$|E
