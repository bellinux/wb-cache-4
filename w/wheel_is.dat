5|$|In {{the cold}} open, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) creates a chore wheel after the office janitor is on vacation, but after {{everyone}} else in the office notes that the <b>wheel</b> <b>is</b> no fun, Pam changes the wheel so that it barely relates to chores or work at all, which goes over well.|$|E
5|$|The area {{housing the}} {{machinery}} {{to drive the}} <b>wheel</b> <b>is</b> located in the final pillar of the aqueduct, and contains seven chambers connected by ladders. Access is by a door located at ground level or an entrance halfway up the tower with a gantry crane to facilitate the installation of equipment.|$|E
5000|$|... 622 mm <b>wheels</b> <b>are</b> {{standard}} on road bikes and are {{commonly known as}} 700C. In some countries, mainly in Continental Europe, 700C (622 mm) <b>wheels</b> <b>are</b> commonly called 28 inch wheels. 24 inch <b>wheels</b> <b>are</b> used for dirt jumping bikes and sometimes on freeride bikes, rear wheel only, as this makes the bike more maneuverable. 29 inch <b>wheels</b> <b>were</b> once used for only Cross Country purposes, but are now becoming more commonplace in other disciplines of mountain biking. A mountain bike with 29" [...] <b>wheels</b> <b>is</b> often referred to as a 29er, and a bike with 27.5 inch <b>wheels</b> <b>is</b> called a 27.5 mountain bike or as a marketing term ″650B bike″.|$|R
50|$|During the {{production}} of the Model AA, the <b>wheels</b> <b>were</b> also changed. Spoked wheels similar in appearance to Model A wheels but much heavier were used during 1928-1929. Twenty inch 6 slot disc <b>wheels</b> <b>were</b> produced by Budd for Ford. In 1930, a new style 20 inch 5 slot disc <b>wheel</b> <b>was</b> adopted. These <b>wheels</b> <b>were</b> used for 1930 and part of 1931. The final <b>wheels</b> <b>were</b> a further modification of the 1930 wheel, with a raised center to reinforce the wheels and allow spacing of dual wheels in the rear so the tires would not rub against each other. The dual <b>wheels</b> <b>were</b> used for a variety of body styles, including dump trucks, tow trucks, tankers, fire trucks, and flatbed stake trucks. Wheel nuts changed with each new style of wheel to meet the changes made in the designs of the <b>wheel.</b> Special <b>wheels</b> <b>were</b> produced for ambulances, buses, and funeral coaches (hearses).|$|R
50|$|The Solent Eye Ferris <b>wheel</b> <b>was</b> {{proposed}} by Billy Manning Ltd for Clarence Pier in 2007. On 17 October, permission for a 130 ft <b>wheel</b> <b>was</b> granted, but {{two days later}} {{it was revealed that}} Portsmouth City Councillors wished the <b>wheel</b> <b>was</b> bigger. As a result, the original plans, which were for a 180 ft <b>wheel,</b> <b>were</b> revived and conditional planning permission subsequently granted on 19 December 2007. It was expected to cost £2 million. The plans were scrapped because the <b>wheel</b> <b>was</b> too large. In 2015, a revived plan for a 110 ft <b>wheel</b> <b>was</b> sent. It was approved and opened in Easter 2016. Despite the popularity of the <b>wheel,</b> it <b>was</b> confirmed in September 2016 that the Solent <b>Wheel</b> will <b>be</b> taken down and sent elsewhere, which was later revealed to be ireland. In March 2017, Clarence Pier's website was updated to say that the wheel would return in 2018.|$|R
5|$|The rear <b>wheel</b> <b>is</b> {{prevented}} from precessing {{as the front}} wheel does by friction of the tires on the ground, and so continues to lean {{as though it were}} not spinning at all. Hence gyroscopic forces do not provide any resistance to tipping.|$|E
5|$|The {{top floor}} of the mill is the dust floor. It could be used for storage of grain and gives {{internal}} access to the cap. The cast-iron wallower, which is driven by the brake <b>wheel</b> <b>is</b> carried {{at the top of the}} upright shaft, in the centre of the mill.|$|E
5|$|Wheel of Fortune (often known {{simply as}} <b>Wheel)</b> <b>is</b> an American {{television}} game show created by Merv Griffin. The show features a competition in which contestants solve word puzzles, {{similar to those used}} in Hangman, to win cash and prizes determined by spinning a giant carnival wheel.|$|E

50|$|The spoked <b>wheel</b> <b>was</b> in {{continued}} use without major modification until the 1870s, when wire-spoked wheels and pneumatic tires were invented. The wire spokes are under tension, not compression, {{making it possible}} for the <b>wheel</b> to <b>be</b> both stiff and light. Early radially-spoked wire wheels gave rise to tangentially-spoked wire <b>wheels,</b> which <b>were</b> widely used on cars into the late 20th century. Cast alloy <b>wheels</b> <b>are</b> now more commonly used; forged alloy <b>wheels</b> <b>are</b> used when weight is critical.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>wheel</b> <b>was</b> first {{installed}} in 2004 {{which was a}} success and consequently a larger 60 m <b>wheel</b> <b>was</b> erected in May 2007.|$|R
5|$|As {{mentioned}} above {{in the section}} on balance, one effect of turning the front <b>wheel</b> <b>is</b> a roll moment caused by gyroscopic precession. The magnitude of this moment {{is proportional to the}} moment of inertia of the front wheel, its spin rate (forward motion), the rate that the rider turns the front wheel by applying a torque to the handlebars, and the cosine of the angle between the steering axis and the vertical.|$|E
5|$|Bikes may {{experience}} {{a variety of}} longitudinal forces and motions. On most bikes, when the front <b>wheel</b> <b>is</b> turned to {{one side or the}} other, the entire rear frame pitches forward slightly, depending on the steering axis angle and the amount of trail. On bikes with suspensions, either front, rear, or both, trim is used to describe the geometric configuration of the bike, especially in response to forces of braking, accelerating, turning, drive train, and aerodynamic drag.|$|E
5|$|Donatian {{stands in}} front of a set of windows that are just outside the {{pictorial}} space. He holds a jewelled processional cross in his left hand, and a wheel containing five lit tapered candles in his right. The <b>wheel</b> <b>is</b> his usual attribute, and refers to an incident when he nearly drowned after being flung into the Tiber, but was saved after Pope Dionysius threw him a carriage wheel he was able to use as a float.|$|E

25|$|Polishing wheels {{come in a}} {{wide variety}} of types to fulfil a wide range of needs. The most common {{materials}} used for polishing <b>wheels</b> <b>are</b> wood, leather, canvas, cotton cloth, plastic, felt, paper, sheepskin, impregnated rubber, canvas composition, and wool; leather and canvas are the most common. Wooden wheels have emery or other abrasives glued onto them and are used to polish flat surfaces and maintained good edges. There are many types of cloth wheels. Cloth <b>wheels</b> that <b>are</b> cemented together are very hard and used for rough work, whereas other cloth <b>wheels</b> that <b>are</b> sewn and glued together are not as aggressive. There <b>are</b> cloth <b>wheels</b> that <b>are</b> not glued or cemented, instead these are sewed and have metal side plates for support. Solid felt <b>wheels</b> <b>are</b> popular for fine finishes. Hard roughing <b>wheels</b> can <b>be</b> made by cementing together strawboard paper disks. Softer paper <b>wheels</b> <b>are</b> made from felt paper. Most <b>wheels</b> <b>are</b> run at approximately 7500 surface feet per minute (SFM), however muslin, felt and leather <b>wheels</b> <b>are</b> usually run at 4000 SFM.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Wheel</b> of Manchester <b>was</b> a {{transportable}} Ferris wheel installation at Piccadilly Gardens, Manchester, England. The <b>wheel</b> <b>was</b> {{originally a}} smaller installation based in Exchange Square, first assembled in 2004. The <b>wheel's</b> size <b>was</b> increased to 60 m in 2007, and plans existed to increase this further. However, these plans were never submitted. The <b>wheel</b> <b>was</b> dismantled in 2012 {{to make way}} for 2012 Olympics celebrations and Metrolink construction work. In 2013, a new 52.7 m <b>wheel</b> <b>was</b> installed in Piccadilly Gardens.|$|R
5|$|In {{the case}} of a front suspension, {{especially}} telescoping fork tubes, the increase in downward force on the front wheel during braking may cause the suspension to compress and the front end to lower. This is known as brake diving. A riding technique that takes advantage of how braking increases the downward force on the front <b>wheel</b> <b>is</b> known as trail braking.|$|E
5|$|The Falkirk <b>Wheel</b> <b>is</b> a {{rotating}} boat lift in Scotland, connecting the Forth and Clyde Canal with the Union Canal. The lift {{is named after}} the town it resides in of Falkirk in central Scotland. It opened in 2002, reconnecting the two canals {{for the first time}} since the 1930s as part of the Millennium Link project.|$|E
5|$|Tires {{generate}} the lateral forces necessary for steering and balance {{through a combination}} of cornering force and camber thrust. Tire inflation pressures have also been found to be important variables in the behavior of a motorcycle at high speeds. Because the front and rear tires can have different slip angles due to weight distribution, tire properties, etc., bikes can experience understeer or oversteer. Of the two, understeer, in which the front wheel slides more than the rear <b>wheel,</b> <b>is</b> more dangerous since front wheel steering is critical for maintaining balance.|$|E

50|$|Omni wheels or poly wheels, {{similar to}} Mecanum <b>wheels,</b> <b>are</b> <b>wheels</b> with small discs around the {{circumference}} which are {{perpendicular to the}} turning direction. The effect <b>is</b> that the <b>wheel</b> can <b>be</b> driven with full force, but will also slide laterally with great ease. These <b>wheels</b> <b>are</b> often employed in holonomic drive systems.|$|R
50|$|Five-spoke 14-inch alloy <b>wheels</b> <b>were</b> standard, while 16-inch <b>wheels</b> <b>were</b> made {{available}} later as an option, together with sports exhaust system, high compression pistons, and high lift camshaft.|$|R
5|$|At low forward speeds, the {{precession}} of {{the front}} <b>wheel</b> <b>is</b> too quick, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to oversteer, start to lean {{the other way and}} eventually oscillate and fall over. At high forward speeds, the precession is usually too slow, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to understeer and eventually fall over without ever having reached the upright position. This instability is very slow, on the order of seconds, and is easy for most riders to counteract. Thus a fast bike may feel stable even though it is actually not self-stable and would fall over if it were uncontrolled.|$|E
5|$|During {{conversations with}} characters, Mass Effect 2 employs a radial command menu, called Dialogue Wheel, where the player's {{dialogue}} options depend on wheel direction. The {{left side of}} the <b>wheel</b> <b>is</b> normally reserved for options that will continue the conversation in depth, while options on the right side tend to move the conversation towards completion. Responses at the top are generally more polite and selfless, while those at the bottom are more aggressive and hostile. The game also introduces a context-sensitive interrupt system, allowing players to interrupt the conversation with direct actions at certain times. Dialogue choices impact how others react to Shepard, the rewards for completing missions, possible discounts from merchants, romances and, most importantly, the Commander's morality.|$|E

Responses at the top are generally more polite and selfless, while those at the bottom are more aggressive and hostile. Dialogue choices impact how others react to Shepard and affect the player's chosen morality. Morality is measured by Paragon (charm) and Renegade (intimidate) points. These points allow the player to develop talents that affect the availability of new special Paragon and Renegade dialogue options with significant impact in the game.|$|E
5000|$|Balance Truing Caliper: This {{device was}} used in {{fashioning}} the wheels and gearwork of the clock, {{to make sure the}} wheel, particularly the balance <b>wheel</b> <b>was</b> balanced and circular. The pivots of the <b>wheel</b> <b>were</b> mounted in the caliper. An index arm was moved next to the edge and the <b>wheel</b> <b>was</b> spun to see if the edge was true.|$|R

5|$|Medstead {{contains}} {{a total of}} six Grade II listed buildings. Southdown Old Farmhouse is a small manor which dates from the 18th century and has undergone 20th century restorations and extensions; the manor was designated as a listed building on 31 May 1985. Another Grade II listed building is a Victorian wheelhouse with a donkey wheel which lies immediately southwest of Southdown Old Farmhouse. The wheelhouse was built in the early 19th century and consists of weatherboarded timber frames on brick plinths. The donkey <b>wheel</b> <b>is</b> in working order and is made of a large timber axle with a rope hanging over a well.|$|E
5|$|Players can utilize Kinect to {{look into}} a corner using a new head {{tracking}} feature. This allows them to look toward the apex of a corner or at nearby cars. The controller or steering <b>wheel</b> <b>is</b> used to control the car while Kinect is used independently for viewing around the driver. Players can also use Kinect as a game controller. In this setting the game automatically accelerates and decelerates the player's vehicle utilizing {{a modified version of}} the feature known as Auto Brake in Forza Motorsport 3. The steering is controlled by placing the players arms out as if controlling an invisible steering wheel. Kinect will allow the player to use voice commands to start races and navigate menus.|$|E
5|$|The bookwheel (also written book {{wheel and}} {{sometimes}} called a reading <b>wheel)</b> <b>is</b> {{a type of}} rotating bookcase designed to allow one person to read a variety of heavy books in one location with ease. The books are rotated vertically similar to the motion of a water wheel, as opposed to rotating on a flat table surface. The design for the bookwheel originally appeared in a 16th-century illustration by Agostino Ramelli, {{at a time when}} large books posed practical problems for readers. Ramelli's design influenced other engineers and, though now obsolete, inspires modern artists and historians.|$|E
