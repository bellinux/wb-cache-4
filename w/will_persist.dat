25|$|Groundhog Day (Canadian French: Jour de la Marmotte; Pennsylvania German: Grundsaudaag, Murmeltiertag) is a {{traditional}} holiday originating in the United States that is celebrated on February 2. According to folklore, if it is cloudy when a groundhog emerges from its burrow on this day, then the spring season will arrive early, some time before the vernal equinox; if it is sunny, the groundhog will supposedly see its shadow and retreat back into its den, and winter weather <b>will</b> <b>persist</b> for six more weeks.|$|E
25|$|Titan {{may become}} warmer in the future. Five to six billion years from now, as the Sun becomes a red giant, surface {{temperatures}} could rise to ~, high enough for stable oceans of a water–ammonia mixture to exist {{on its surface}}. As the Sun's ultraviolet output decreases, the haze in Titan's upper atmosphere will be depleted, lessening the anti-greenhouse effect on its surface and enabling the greenhouse effect created by atmospheric methane to play a far greater role. These conditions together could create an environment agreeable to exotic forms of life, and <b>will</b> <b>persist</b> for several hundred million years. This was sufficient time for simple life to evolve on Earth, although the presence of ammonia on Titan could cause the same chemical reactions to proceed more slowly.|$|E

Thus, in 2033, Superman as he is depicted in Action Comics #1 will become public domain, along with other story elements such as Lois Lane and the city of Metropolis. Some later developments of the character, such as his heat vision (introduced in a 1949 story), may not be available to unlicensed authors as they were introduced in works that <b>will</b> <b>persist</b> longer under copyright. Supporting characters such as Lana Lang, or locales such as the Fortress of Solitude, will also persist for longer in copyright.|$|E

25|$|Frozen fog (also {{known as}} ice fog) is {{any kind of}} fog where the {{droplets}} have frozen into extremely tiny crystals of ice in midair. Generally this requires temperatures at or below , making it common only in and near the Arctic and Antarctic regions. It is most often seen in urban areas where it is created by the freezing of water vapor present in automobile exhaust and combustion products from heating and power generation. Urban ice fog can become extremely dense and <b>will</b> <b>persist</b> day and night until the temperature rises. Extremely small amounts of ice fog falling from the sky form a type of precipitation called ice crystals, often reported in Barrow, Alaska. Ice fog often leads to the visual phenomenon of light pillars.|$|E
25|$|Two {{additional}} {{challenges are}} found in unobserved polio transmission and in vaccine-derived poliovirus. First, most polio infections are asymptomatic or result in minor symptoms, with less than 1% of infections leading to paralysis and most infected people are unaware that they carry the disease, allowing polio to spread widely before cases are seen. And since 2000, {{there have been a}} number of outbreaks of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus, following mutations or recombinations in the attenuated strain used for the oral polio vaccine, which have raised the necessity of eventually switching to the more expensive inactivated polio vaccine. The risk of vaccine-derived polio <b>will</b> <b>persist</b> long after the switch to inactivated vaccine, since a small number of chronic excretors continue to produce active virus for years (or even decades) after their initial exposure to the oral vaccine.|$|E
25|$|The {{functionality}} of {{a protein}} is {{highly dependent on}} its structure. Changing a single amino acid in a protein may reduce its ability {{to carry out this}} function, or the mutation may even change the function that the protein carries out. Changes like these may severely impact a crucial function in a cell, potentially causing the cell — and in extreme cases, the organism — to die. Conversely, the change may allow the cell to continue functioning albeit differently, and the mutation can be passed on to the organism's offspring. If this change does not result in any significant physical disadvantage to the offspring, the possibility exists that this mutation <b>will</b> <b>persist</b> within the population. The possibility also exists that the change in function becomes advantageous. In either case, while being subjected to the processes of natural selection, the point mutation has been accepted into the genetic pool.|$|E

25|$|A {{major element}} of {{strategy}} in these sports is {{the condition of}} the ball. Since bowling in cricket has more variations (such as bounce, swing, seam movement, off-spin, leg-spin and so on), {{the condition of the}} ball also affects play to a great degree. In Test cricket, the same ball must be used for at least 80 overs unless it is lost, damaged or illegally modified at which point it must be replaced with a used ball in a similar condition. After the 80 overs, obtaining a new ball is at the discretion of the fielding captain – who will often ask for a new ball immediately, since a new ball is harder, smoother, bounces higher and has an intact seam, which produces greater conventional swing. But when a captain feels that a spin bowling attack {{is more likely to be}} successful, he <b>will</b> <b>persist</b> with the old ball, which is rougher and better grips the surface as well the bowler's fingers. In baseball the ball is replaced numerous times during a game to ensure it is in optimum condition.|$|E

30|$|The {{threshold}} R_ 0 {{is increasing}} with the rumor propagation coefficient β, the believe and spread rate θ. If there exist many active members who believe {{and spread the}} rumor actively, then β and θ will be sufficiently large. Then R_ 0 > 1 holds easily, and the rumor <b>will</b> <b>persists</b> at an ‘endemic’ level. Conversely, if the managers induct public views and remind more carefully the public of not relying on rumors, increasing the ability to distinguish, then the parameters β and θ will become smaller, and make the threshold R_ 0 < 1, and the rumor will ‘die out’. The threshold R_ 0 for the differential equation model also determines the asymptotic behavior of the infectious fraction y(t). When R_ 0 > 1, y(t) always approaches the rumor-endemic value, y^∗=θα w^∗/λα w^∗+(γ+ 1), where w^∗=βθα-(α+ 1)(γ+ 1)/α (α+ 1)(βθ+λ).|$|R

People with cancer pain who accept that pain <b>will</b> <b>persist</b> and nevertheless are able to engage in a meaningful life were less susceptible to catastrophizing and depression in one study. People with cancer pain who have clear goals, and the motivation and means to achieve those goals, were found in two studies to experience much lower levels of pain, fatigue and depression.|$|E
