5|$|This was {{the fourth}} postseason start of Lee's career. In all four starts, he <b>went</b> <b>at</b> least seven innings and gave up {{no more than one}} earned run. The only other {{starting}} pitcher ever to begin his postseason career with four such starts was Christy Mathewson.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, Abbe {{travelled}} to the United Kingdom. He <b>went</b> <b>at</b> {{the invitation}} of the London Judo Society (LJS), {{and was the first}} master to teach aikido in the UK. That year, he demonstrated aikido at the LJS and at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Abbe came to experience two problems at the LJS: first, he felt that the students there were more concerned with competition than his theories, and second, he felt that the students did not treat him with the appropriate respect for someone of his rank and experience in the martial arts. According to the International Budo Council (IBC), he founded the IBC in 1955.|$|E
5|$|A new {{application}} {{for the same}} route was made on 16 April 1907, this time from Solicitor H. M. Helliesen, Wholesaler A. Thune-Larsen, and Works Manager T. Poppe of Kristiania Sporveisselskab (KSS), the company which operated one the city tramways. This time the plans were slightly changed, with the route proposed built with a tramway {{rather than as a}} railway. In particular, the line was to connect to the Gamleby Line (then called the Oslo Line) of KSS's network and run up Ekeberg to an intersection between Ekeberveien and Kirkeveien. The plans called for a regular street tram with regular city tram vehicles. At the time, the city limits of Oslo <b>went</b> <b>at</b> Sjømannskolen. The application for the part within Oslo was sent to the city, while for the section outside the city, the application was sent to the Ministry of Labour. Within Oslo, a new line would only have to be built from Oslo Hospital to Sjømannskolen, while from Oslo Hospital to the city center, the line would follow the Gamleby Line.|$|E

5|$|That evening Kennedy held a {{televised}} {{press conference on}} the possibility of a domestic Peace Corps-like program to reduce racism in white suburbs. On April 8 Kennedy and his wife <b>went,</b> <b>at</b> the request of Coretta Scott King, to Atlanta to attend Martin Luther King Jr.'s funeral. That evening he held a meeting with his aides over how {{to get the attention of}} middle-class whites weary of the civil rights movement in order to relieve the racial tension in the country. Kennedy returned to Indiana and on April 10 delivered his third and final speech inspired by King's death. Moving past his previous calls for compassion and an end to violence, he admonished whites to accept and welcome blacks into American society. Throughout the rest of the month, Kennedy toned down his campaign rhetoric and fixed on a theme of unity and reconciliation.|$|E
25|$|The good is {{that the}} Husker {{pitchers}} issued a league-low 2.77 walks per nine innings. They <b>went</b> <b>at</b> least 45 innings without an error three times. The Huskers scored five or more runs in an inning 12 times in 11 games. Alex Gordon was the lone Husker All-American.|$|E

25|$|Like {{others of}} his time, he puzzled over the {{problems}} of fitting native peopling of the New World and their development into a Biblical framework, and seldom doubted authenticity of miracles, or the Providential intervention which accounted for Cortes' Conquest {{as an expression of}} Divine Will. But for the most part he <b>went</b> <b>at</b> his tasks with professional coolness, and a rather high degree of historiographical craftsmanship.|$|E
25|$|He then flew to West Point {{where he}} also {{reviewed}} the troops, an honor infrequently given to a visiting official with the rank of just Captain. When at West Point, he presented {{a picture of the}} Mexican Military Academy at Chapultepec. Following West Point, he flew to Lowell Massachusetts to dedicate a new field there. He <b>went</b> <b>at</b> the request of Edith Nourse Rogers who was responsible for the lifting of an embargo of aviation products to Mexico. He then returned to New York City.|$|E
25|$|All {{this changed}} after the embargo was lifted in 1647 (during the final peace negotiations). Dutch trade to Spain and Portugal, Italy and the Levant not only {{immediately}} rebounded to prewar levels, {{aided by the}} way the Spanish authorities facilitated the resumption of trade, but Dutch shipping rates and insurance premiums also fell to permanently lower levels. This stimulated Dutch carrying trade in the rest of Europe, causing a fundamental restructuring of Dutch trade in the years 1647–51 that <b>went</b> <b>at</b> the expense of the Republic's commercial rivals, especially (but not exclusively) England.|$|E

25|$|Bocskai {{married a}} wealthy widow, Margit Hagymássy, in late 1583. Her dowry {{included}} the fortress of Nagykereki {{and the nearby}} villages. Stephen Báthory dissolved the regency council and appointed Ghyczy to administer Transylvania on Sigismund's behalf in May 1585. Bocskai retained his seat in the royal council. After Stephen Báthory died in December 1586, Bocskai <b>went</b> <b>at</b> least twice to Poland to negotiate the implementation of Báthory's last will. During his visits, he realized that most Polish noblemen {{did not want to}} continue Báthory's policy and Transylvania could no longer expect support from Poland.|$|E
25|$|In 1987, {{the teams}} {{had one of}} the most memorable playoff series in NHL history. The Islanders forced Game 7 after being down 3–1 in the series. In overtime, the two goaltenders, Kelly Hrudey for New York and Bob Mason for Washington <b>went</b> <b>at</b> it save for save, {{stopping}} every scoring chance the other team had. Finally, after three scoreless overtimes, Pat LaFontaine scored the winner at 8:47 of the fourth overtime period, giving the Islanders a 3–2 victory and a 4–3 series win in a game known as the Easter Epic.|$|E
25|$|John {{attended}} the Laneast village school where he acquired some Greek and algebra. From there, he <b>went,</b> <b>at</b> {{the age of}} twelve, to Devonport, where his mother's cousin, the Rev. John Couch Grylls, kept a private school. There he learned classics but was largely self-taught in mathematics, studying in the Library of Devonport Mechanics' Institute and reading Rees's Cyclopædia and Samuel Vince's Fluxions. He observed Halley's comet in 1835 from Landulph and the following year started {{to make his own}} astronomical calculations, predictions and observations, engaging in private tutoring to finance his activities.|$|E

25|$|Crosman, {{like many}} a heralded stage star, held off from motion pictures. But by 1914 and {{possibly}} {{out of curiosity}} she 'signed up', as the popular motto <b>went</b> <b>at</b> the time, for a one-picture deal with Adolph Zukor's Famous Players. It was a film version of The Unwelcome Mrs. Hatch, which as a play had been a winning success for Mrs Fiske in 1901 on Broadway. The Supreme Test followed in 1915 for Universal Studios but afterwards her silent film appearances were sporadic. Her husband Maurice Campbell joined {{his wife in the}} movie industry eventually becoming a noted director.|$|E
25|$|The Sandinista Assembly -FSLN's highest {{decision-making}} body- {{was held}} on 26 February in Managua. Lewites had announced that he planned a march {{to the site of}} the event with his followers in support of his candidacy. Some 200 meters from the gates of the “Olofito” convention center where the Sandinista Assembly was meeting, they were stopped by a larger pro-Ortega demonstration. For several minutes both bands literally <b>went</b> <b>at</b> each other with fists, stones and even clubs. The police had to intervene, placing themselves between the rival bands. In the Assembly, the official leadership responded by expelling Lewites and his campaign chief Víctor Hugo Tinoco from the party.|$|E
25|$|In the two match {{series against}} New Zealand, Broad took 3–77 in New Zealand's first innings. With New Zealand chasing a big score {{to win the}} match, Broad took 3–50 in New Zealand's second innings to help England win by 124 runs and go 1–0 up in the series. Broad took 5–109 in New Zealand's first innings of the next Test, {{although}} he <b>went</b> <b>at</b> an economy rate of over six an over. He made 46 with the bat to help England level the scores after the first innings. He took 2–94 in the second innings but was again expensive, and New Zealand {{went on to win}} the match and tie the series 1–1.|$|E

25|$|Several {{managers}} {{came and}} <b>went</b> <b>at</b> the St. Jakob Stadium between then, until Basel finally {{returned to the}} Nationalliga A in 1994 under Claude Andrey. Basel avoided relegation by three points in their first season back at the top-flight, but Andrey left {{and was replaced by}} Karl Engel. Engel led Basel to a fifth-place finish in his first season in charge and a solid mid-table finish in 1997, but he was sacked after a poor start to the 1997–98 campaign, in which Basel finished second-last. Jörg Berger then took over but lasted only a year in charge before Christian Gross was appointed. Gross' appointment went hand-in-hand with the financial backing that had just been put into the club and it was not long until Basel returned to the top.|$|E
25|$|The Reformation in Scotland {{began in}} conflict. Fiery Calvinist preacher John Knox {{returned}} to Scotland in 1560, having been exiled {{for his part}} in the assassination of Cardinal Beaton. He proceeded to Dundee where a large number of Protestant sympathisers and noblemen had gathered. Knox was declared an outlaw by the Queen Regent, Mary of Guise, but the Protestants <b>went</b> <b>at</b> once to Perth, a walled town that could be defended in case of a siege. At the church of St John the Baptist, Knox preached a fiery sermon that provoked an iconoclastic riot. A mob poured into the church and it was entirely gutted. In the pattern of Calvinist riots in France and the Netherlands, the mob then attacked two friaries in the town, looting their gold and silver and smashing images. Mary of Guise gathered those nobles loyal to her and a small French army.|$|E
25|$|After {{retaining}} the tag team title against the Headbangers by disqualification on the edition of March 24, 1997 of Monday Night Raw, {{the tension between}} the two bubbled over. An incensed Hart demanded a shot at Bulldog's European title the next week. The match was booked for March 31; on the night, the two <b>went</b> <b>at</b> it with such intensity that many thought the tag team champions had finally gone their separate ways. Then in a shocking moment, the recently turned heel Bret Hart appeared at ringside and stopped the match. Bret appealed to both Owen and Bulldog, talking about the importance of family. They agreed to put their differences aside and join with Bret to form the new Hart Foundation, an anti-American stable that also included Hart in-law Jim Neidhart and Hart family friend Brian Pillman.|$|E
