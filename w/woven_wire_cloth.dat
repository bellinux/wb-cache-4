50|$|<b>Woven</b> <b>wire</b> <b>cloth,</b> {{typically}} {{produced from}} stainless steel, is commonly {{employed as a}} filtration medium for sieving {{in a wide range}} of industries. Most often woven with a plain weave, or a twill weave for the lightest of meshes, apertures can be produced from a few microns upwards (e.g. 25 microns), employing wires with diameters from as little as 25 microns. A twill weave allows a mesh to be woven when the wire diameter is too thick in proportion to the aperture. Other, less commonplace, weaves, such as Dutch/Hollander, allow the production of meshes that are stronger and/or having smaller apertures.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, {{screen cloth}} {{was made with}} metal wires woven with a loom. Today, woven cloth is still widely used {{primarily}} because they are less expensive than other types of screen media. Over the years, different weaving techniques have been developed; either to increase the open area percentage or add wear-life. Slotted opening woven cloth is used where product shape is not a priority and where users need a higher open area percentage. Flat-top woven cloth is used when the consumer wants to increase wear-life. On regular woven wire, the crimps (knuckles on woven wires) wear out faster {{than the rest of}} the cloth resulting in premature breakage. On flat-top woven wire, the cloth wears out equally until half of the wire diameter is worn, resulting in a longer wear life. Unfortunately flat-top <b>woven</b> <b>wire</b> <b>cloth</b> is not widely used because of the lack of crimps that causes a pronounced reduction of passing fines resulting in premature wear of con crushers.|$|E

Purpose-designed test cases were used to validate the capability of the developed algorithms and were found to give expected numerical predictions. A selection of domains was used to investigate the effect of weave pattern, aperture to diameter ratio and Reynolds number on flow pattern and pressure drop. Based on these domains, simulations were successfully conducted to investigate fluid flow through four basic pore types in a plain weave, twill weave and satin weave. The flow fields in the interstices were illustrated using a commercial graphics software package. The results showed that the weave pattern has a profound effect on the fluid flow pattern and pressure drop across the wire mesh. Simulation results showed that plain weave gives the lowest pressure drop, while satin weave gives the highest pressure drop across the woven cloths. Fluid flow through a plain weave was further investigated in conjunction with the experimental studies of Rushton (1969) using water and Chhabra and Richardson (1985) using shear-thinning fluids. Simulations were tested against experimental data extracted from both studies. The close agreement of the results to those of the available experimental data in literature showed the accuracy and the reliability of the predictions.

50|$|Self-cleaning {{screen media}} was {{initially}} engineered to resolve screen cloth blinding, clogging and pegging problems. The {{idea was to}} place crimped wires side-by-side on a flat surface, creating openings and then, in some way, holding them together over the support bars (crown bars or bucker bars). This would allow the wires {{to be free to}} vibrate between the support bars, preventing blinding, clogging and pegging of the cloth. Initially, crimped longitudinal wires on self-cleaning cloth were held together over support bars with woven wire. In the 50s, some manufacturers started to cover the woven cross wires with caulking or rubber to prevent premature wear of the crimps (knuckles on woven wires). One of the pioneer products in this category was ONDAP GOMME made by the French manufacturer Giron. During the mid 90s, Major Wire Industries Ltd., a Quebec manufacturer, developed a “hybrid” self-cleaning screen cloth called Flex-Mat, without woven cross wires. In this product, the crimped longitudinal wires are held in place by polyurethane strips. Instead of locking (impeding) the vibration over the support bars with woven cross wires, the polyurethane strips lessens the vibration of the longitudinal wires over the support bars but does not stop it, consequently allowing vibration from hook to hook. Major Wire quickly started to promote this product as a high-performance screen that helped producers screen more in-specification material for less cost and not simply a problem solver. They claimed that the independent vibrating wires helped produce more product compared to a <b>woven</b> <b>wire</b> <b>cloth</b> with the same opening (aperture) and wire diameter. This higher throughput would be {{a direct result of the}} higher vibration frequency of each independent wire of the screen cloth (calculated in hertz) compared to the shaker vibration (calculated in RPM), accelerating the stratification of the material bed. Another benefit that helped the throughput increase is that hybrid self-cleaning screen media offered a better open area percentage than woven wire screen media. Due to its flat surface (no knuckles), hybrid self-cleaning screen media can use a smaller wire diameter for the same aperture than woven wire and still lasts as long, resulting in a greater opening percentage.|$|E

30|$|In true sense, no {{technologies}} independently counter all the problems. The {{development of}} {{technology is a}} dynamic process that moves forward slowly and recommendations are made based on the best science available at that time. However, with new research and new results, the flaws of existing technologies may be removed. That is why {{the concept of the}} combinations of technologies or in other sense hybrid technologies has come. Scientists and technologists have orchestrated according to the requirement. Let us discuss with the synergistic RO technology first. In the RO technology, feed pretreatment is vital for RO to avoid problems, i.e., fouling, damaging the membranes. Conventional pretreatment steps include chemicals addition, i.e., acid, coagulant/flocculant, disinfection. Coagulation and flocculation (coagulants–flocculants) are dealt in water treatment process. Chlorine treatment is treated as disinfection process and commonly employed. But chlorination shortens the stability of the membrane and, thus, dechlorination treatment (viz. sodium bi sulfite) is required. In media filtration, water is treated by passing through granular media like pumice, anthracite, gravels, etc. {{that can be used in}} combination. Cartridge filter (made up of papers, <b>woven</b> <b>wire,</b> <b>cloth)</b> is used as the last pretreatment step to retain particles in the size range 1 – 10 μm. To check the quality, ‘Silt Intensity Index’ or SDI parameter is important. Actually, SDI considers the ratio of two flow measurements, one at the beginning, and the other at the end by passing feed water through a 0.45  μm filter paper in dead end mode at constant pressure (Saha and Bhattacharya 2010).|$|E

This paper describes a novel sensing system, its methodology and experimental verifications for analysis {{of the presence of}} contaminants in the engine lubricants. The sensing methodology is based on the statistical shape analysis methodology utilizing optical analysis of the distortion effect when an object image is obtained through a thin random optical medium. The novelty of the proposed sensing system lies within the employed methodology which an object with a known periodic shape is introduced behind a thin film of the contaminated lubricant. In this case, an acquired image represents a combined lubricant-object optical appearance, where an a priori known periodical structure of the object is distorted by a contaminated lubricant.

Measured on-line parameters were used for optical analysis of fresh and contaminated lubricants. Estimation of contaminant presence and lubricant condition was performed by comparison of parameters for fresh and contaminated lubricants.

40|$|Scope of {{the present}} work was the {{investigation}} of the oxide scale formation on metallic high-temperature alloys resulting during reaction with the atmosphere of the combustion of industrial gas oil (IGO). The Ni-Cr-based alloys 601 (2. 4851), 602 (2. 4633), 603, 693 and 617 (2. 4663) were tested at elevated temperatures between 900 °C and 1050 °C in a burner rig equipped with a low-NOx recirculation burner by application as material of the burner flame tube. Further on, the oxide scale on a <b>woven</b> <b>wire</b> <b>cloth</b> made of a Ni-Cr-based alloy was analysed. The wire cloth was used as the hot surface of a radiant burner at temperatures of approximately 685 °C for an operation time of 844 h. All alloys investigated in the low-NOx burner rig showed following oxide scale structure: a chromium oxide scale at the alloy surface and aluminium or silicon oxide (on alloy 603) beneath. Particles with a composition {{similar to that of the}} bulk alloy were found enclosed in the chromium oxide scale. Frequently these particles were located near the oxide-gas boundary indicating an impending local degradation of the chromium oxide scale. Aluminium oxide grew predominantly along grain boundaries in the depth of the bulk. During the test period of up to 3000 h no aluminium oxide scale was found. For longer investigation times accelerated internal oxidation of aluminium was observed. In contrast to aluminium, silicon formed an albeit noncontinuous scale of silicon oxide directly below the chromium oxide layer. The diffusion of chromium towards the surface was inhibited by the silicon scale, which resulted in a slower kinetic of the chromium oxide growth and consequently a thinner chromium oxide scale. However, as the silicon oxide scale was not protective. Mo-oxides formed in the bulk – Mo being an alloying element of alloy 603 – followed by breakaway oxidation. In case of the aluminium alloyed material the formation of nitrides in the bulk indicated the breakdown of the oxide scale. Failure of the alloys was related to massive inward nitrogen diffusion and the formation of aluminium nitrides in the bulk. Therefore it is assumed that in nitrogen rich atmospheres a high aluminium content is unfavourable due to the strong affinity of aluminium to nitrogen. In general it was observed, that at lower temperatures, as a result of a slower growth kinetic, the nitride formation began later. Short term tests of 50 hours of alloy 602, alloy 603 and alloy 693 showed, that a thicker and more uniform oxide layer formed when the burner was operated with standard quality IGO (1700 mg/kg S), compared with the oxide scale formed in the case of operation with fuel with reduced sulphur content (20 mg/kg S). Ventilation with air after burner shut down had no significant effect on chromium oxide scale thickness. The time dependence of the observed growth of the chromium oxide scale was fitted with a power law. A deviation from the parabolic law has been found indicating an oxide loss due to spallation. Reasonable estimation of life time was achieved by logarithmic plots of the time dependence of the chromium depletion measured by line scans on cross sections of the samples. The metallographic investigation of the hot surface of the radiant burner showed a thin continuous chromium oxide layer. No indication of damage of the scale, a small depth of internal oxidation and the absence of a significant chromium depletion zone were found.

To gain more insight in the heat transfer and the friction of air that flows along such a <b>wire</b> <b>cloth,</b> measurements were done, in which the heat transfer coefficient, expressed as StPr 2 / 3, and the friction factor were measured. For these measurements two types of <b>wire</b> <b>cloths</b> were used, the distance between the capillaries was 8 or 12 mm. The heat transfer and the friction of the 8 mm <b>wire</b> <b>cloths</b> was measured at different mutual distances. A mass balance was used to measure the friction on a single object, but the influence of the wall seemed to be too large and to uncertain to use this kind of set-up. In further measurements the cloths were placed in a stack in a tube, the pressure was measured with a pressure difference meter, the heat transfer was measured by temperature sensors. The heat transfer per cloth seemed to be between 2 and 4 times higher than that of a flat plate with the same size. The heat transfer per cloth increased, with increasing mutual distance (from 0. 007 to 0. 011 m).

40|$|Introduction: Filtration media {{selection}} {{is dependent upon}} filtration level required and operational pressures. Traditionally, the filter portion is formed from <b>woven</b> <b>wire</b> mesh manufactured from drawn wire, arranged in a grid pattern although different weaves are available, allowing different levels of filtration using different wire diameters. The open area of the filter {{is limited by the}} wire diameters, affecting the overall strength of the woven mesh. The design freedoms of additive manufacturing (AM) allows filter media design with known aperture sizes whilst reducing equivalent wire diameter to produce filter media with a greater open area compared to the equivalent <b>woven</b> <b>wire</b> mesh. Method: AM filter media were designed to have aperture sizes of 500 µm and 1000 µm as found in # 32 and # 18 mesh respectively, but with a decrease in ‘wire’ diameter to increase the ratio of open area. Strength was increased through addition of further filtration layers to form depth filters. The filter media were then tested for aperture size, collapse pressure and pressure drop. Results: AM filter media designs delivered an increase in open area compared to comparable <b>woven</b> <b>wire</b> mesh media. Addition of further layers increased the filters strength and the complexity of the particulate path through the filter and so decreased the path size. Conclusions: Filter media designs produced using AM can be manipulated to produce an increase in open area, retaining strength compared to conventional <b>woven</b> <b>wire</b> mesh. The increased open area decreases the pressure drop across the filter and so less pumping energy is required...|$|R
