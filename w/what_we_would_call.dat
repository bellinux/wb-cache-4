What appeared to others as political arguments were for Priestley always, at their root, religious arguments. Many of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> Priestley's political writings were aimed at supporting the repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts, a political issue that had its foundation in religion.|$|E

500|$|The film {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. On 19 November 1978, the magazine Ananda Vikatan criticised {{the gaps in}} the film, particularly the abundance of English dialogue, the excessive focus on naturalism, and lower standard of technical work (especially the cinematography). Despite these perceived flaws, the magazine still appreciated the film, stating that the actors immersed themselves into their characters, leading to them not really acting before the camera but living the characters. K. Balamurugan of Rediff said, [...] "It was <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> parallel cinema these days." ...|$|E

In the Water Spirits, series, Lowe states [...] "the Water Spirits pieces are really {{an effort to}} show some respect for natural forces as well as <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> spiritual forces.

[...] The description {{noted that it}} was “amateur designed” – meant to convey expertise in designing specifically for the amateur radio operator - not the usual {{sense of the term}} amateur. [...] And it stated that “amateurs in the field are enthusiastic about praising its performance under actual operating conditions,” indicating that it had been through <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> beta testing today.|$|E

As a revolutionary activist in Cuba's long struggle for independence he translated into English a number of articles and pamphlets supporting that movement. In addition to fluent English, Martí also spoke French, Italian, Latin and Classical Greek fluently, the latter learned so he could read the Greek classical works in the original.|$|E

2500|$|Ever the {{innovative}} promoter, Fisher seemed tireless {{in his efforts}} to draw attention to Miami Beach, a story recounted by PBS. Fisher had acquired a baby elephant named [...] "Rosie" [...] who was a favorite with newspaper photographers. In 1921, he got free publicity all across the country with <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> today a promotional [...] "photo-op" [...] of Rosie serving as a 'golf caddy' for vacationing President-elect Warren Harding. Billboards of bathing beauties enjoying white beaches and blue ocean waters appeared around the country.

2500|$|Meucci {{separated}} the two directions of transmission {{in order to}} eliminate the so-called [...] "local effect", adopting <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> today a 4-wire-circuit. He constructed a simple calling system with a telegraphic manipulator which short-circuited the instrument of the calling person, producing in the instrument of the called person a succession of impulses (clicks), much more intense than those of normal conversation. As {{he was aware that}} his device required a bigger band than a telegraph, he found some means to avoid the so-called [...] "skin effect" [...] through superficial treatment of the conductor or by acting on the material (copper instead of iron). He successfully used an insulated copper plait, thus anticipating the litz wire used by Nikola Tesla in RF coils.|$|E
2500|$|In short, {{he shifted}} {{attention}} to the perception of different sounds. Boas begins by raising an empirical question: when people describe one sound in different ways, is it because they cannot perceive the difference, or might there be another reason? He immediately establishes {{that he is not}} concerned with cases involving perceptual deficit—the aural equivalent of color-blindness. He points out that the question of people who describe one sound in different ways is comparable to that of people who describe different sounds in one way. This is crucial for research in descriptive linguistics: when studying a new language, how are we to note the pronunciation of different words? (in this point, Boas anticipates and lays the groundwork for the distinction between phonemics and phonetics.) People may pronounce a word {{in a variety of ways}} and still recognize that they are using the same word. The issue, then, is not [...] "that such sensations are not recognized in their individuality" [...] (in other words, people recognize differences in pronunciations); rather, it is that sounds [...] "are classified according to their similarity" [...] (in other words, that people classify a variety of perceived sounds into one category). A comparable visual example would involve words for colors. The English word [...] "green" [...] can be used to refer to a variety of shades, hues, and tints. But there are some languages that have no word for [...] "green". In such cases, people might classify <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> [...] "green" [...] as either [...] "yellow" [...] or [...] "blue". This is not an example of color-blindness—people can perceive differences in color, but they categorize similar colors in a different way than English speakers.|$|E
2500|$|During the Age of Discovery (the Dutch Golden Age in particular, {{approximately}} 1580s–1702), {{using their}} expertise in doing business, cartography, shipbuilding, seafaring and navigation, the Dutch {{traveled to the}} far corners of the world, leaving their language embedded {{in the names of}} many places. Dutch exploratory voyages revealed largely unknown landmasses to the civilized world and put their names on the world map. In the 16th and 17th centuries, [...] helped lay the foundations for the birth and development of modern cartography, including nautical cartography and stellar cartography (celestial cartography). The Dutch-speaking people came to dominate the map making and map printing industry by virtue of their own travels, trade ventures, and widespread commercial networks. The Dutch initiated <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> today the free flow of geographical information. As Dutch ships reached into the unknown corners of the globe, Dutch cartographers incorporated new discoveries into their work. Instead of using the information themselves secretly, they published it, so the maps multiplied freely. The Dutch were the first (non-natives) to undisputedly discover, explore and map many unknown isolated areas of the world such as Svalbard, Australia, New Zealand, Tonga, Sakhalin, and Easter Island. In many cases the Dutch were the first Europeans the natives would encounter. Australia (originally known as New Holland), never became a permanent Dutch settlement, yet the Dutch were the first to undisputedly map its coastline. The Dutch navigators charted almost three-quarters of the Australian coastline, except the east coast. During the Age of Exploration, the Dutch explorers and cartographers were also the first to systematically observe and map (chart) the largely unknown far southern skies – the first significant scientific addition to the celestial cartography since [...] (2nd century AD). Among the IAU's 88 modern constellations, there are 15 Dutch-created constellations, including 12 [...]|$|E

The disappearance of the president seems like a kidnapping, but no ransom is demanded.|$|R
5000|$|Like other {{colognes}} of the era, Florida Water was {{valued for}} its refreshing and tonic nature {{as well as}} its scent, and {{could be used as a}} skin toner or as <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> now <b>call</b> a [...] "body splash". It was also used as a toilet water (eau de toilette), by adding it to the bath or wash-water.|$|R
50|$|It was {{not long}} after this time that the tribe’s chief, Sidapitu, fell gravely ill - {{possibly}} with <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> now <b>call</b> bowel cancer.

60|$|Partially {{concealed}} in a cavern {{at the base}} of a stupendous, almost perpendicular, cliff, stood the wizard Ujarak and his pupil Ippegoo. The former silently watched the latter as he fitted a slender spear, or rather giant arrow, to a short handle, and prepared to discharge it at a flock of sea-birds which were flying about in front of them within <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> easy gunshot.|$|E
6000|$|Instead {{of dancing}} {{at the great}} [...] "corroborees," [...] or {{religious}} ballets of his people, he would [...] "sit out" [...] with a girl whose sad, romantic history became fatally interwoven with his own. In vain the medicine-men assured him that Pund-jel, the great spirit, was angry. Why-Why was indifferent to the thunder which {{was believed to be}} the voice of Pund-jel. His behaviour at the funeral of a celebrated brave actually caused <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> a reformation in burial ceremonies.|$|E
60|$|When Egbert saw {{his little}} girl limping horribly--not only limping but lurching horribly in crippled, childish way, his heart again {{hardened}} with chagrin, like steel that is tempered again. There was a tacit understanding between him and {{his little girl}}: not <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> love, but a weapon-like kinship. There was a tiny touch of irony in his manner towards her, contrasting sharply with Winifred's heavy, unleavened solicitude and care. The child flickered back to him with an answering little smile of irony and recklessness: an odd flippancy which made Winifred only the more sombre and earnest.|$|E
50|$|Similarly, Astro-Theology {{includes}} several newly identified nebulae (this {{was the name}} used at the time for all extended astronomical objects: some of his nebulae are <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> now <b>call</b> star clusters).

5000|$|Within {{the system}} of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> now <b>call</b> [...] "Roman {{religion}} (in the modern sense of the word), the term religio originally meant an obligation to the gods, something expected by them from human beings or a matter of particular care or concern as related to the gods, [...] "reverence for God or the gods, careful pondering of divine things, piety".|$|R
2500|$|Euler {{continued}} {{to write on}} the topic; in his Reflexions sur quelques loix generales de la nature (1748), he called the quantity [...] "effort".
