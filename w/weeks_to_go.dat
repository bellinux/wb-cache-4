5|$|The {{refusal to}} grant {{affiliation}} caused a bitter row to ensue that showed little sign of being resolved. Despite {{not having the}} support of the governing body, the new league continued their plans regardless. No affiliation would have meant that the clubs would have problems attaining work permits for their signings and finding officials to referee their matches. The row also threatened the future of the Nottingham Panthers, as the National Ice Centre were reluctant to allow a team from an unaffiliated league hire their arena. The issue was resolved in August 2003 when the Panthers and the NIC announced an icetime agreement. The EIHL finally agreed affiliation in August 2003, with only <b>weeks</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> before the beginning of the new season.|$|E
25|$|The sovereigntist {{campaign}} remained moribund under Parizeau. It {{was only}} with a few <b>weeks</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> in the campaign that support for sovereignty skyrocketed to above 50%.

25|$|Devastated {{to report}} that Blur won't be {{performing}} at BDO in 2014. It's a shock that {{it has come to}} this. Only 8 <b>weeks</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> the band feels that with the constantly shifting goalposts and challenging conditions of the organisers, they can't let it drag on any longer and want to make this announcement, to be clear to Blur fans that they won't be there. We've done our very best to work with the organisers and considered every option to make it happen, but they've let us down and let everyone else down too.|$|E
25|$|Finally, in 1919, Richmond {{made their}} first Grand Final appearance, losing to Collingwood. Richmond stoked a rivalry with Collingwood by {{recruiting}} their former skipper Dan Minogue as playing coach and gained vengeance by beating Collingwood in the 1920 VFL Grand Final {{to secure a}} first flag in the big league. This was followed by an even better performance the next year. The only club that continued to beat Richmond {{on a regular basis}} was Carlton. Finishing minor premier with only one loss for the season in 1921, Carlton were the hottest premiership favourite, yet Richmond managed to beat them in two classic finals matches played over successive <b>weeks</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back-to-back.|$|E
25|$|Once {{again in}} the 1925 trial matches for the Oxford side, Legge failed, {{and he was not}} {{selected}} for the first three first-class matches played by the University. He finally made his debut in the fourth game, against Worcestershire and hit 120, reaching his century in two hours; he followed that up with 40 in the second innings. He achieved little in the next two matches, but was still awarded his Blue with four <b>weeks</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> before the University Match after just three matches for the university. The selection was justified, as Legge topped the Oxford batting averages for the season and in the match against Cambridge scored 38 and 15 as an Oxford side packed with batsmen held out for a draw against an apparently superior Cambridge side.|$|E

500|$|The Gold Miners grew {{increasingly}} dissatisfied with Hornet Stadium. [...] Anderson blamed losses of US$10 million {{over two years}} on the facility. After attempts to have Sacramento State upgrade or replace the facility failed, he announced in October 1994—with two <b>weeks</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> in the season—that the Gold Miners would be playing elsewhere in 1995. [...] Anderson initially intended to move to Oakland, but quickly abandoned those plans after {{it became apparent that}} Los Angeles Raiders owner Al Davis was seriously considering moving his NFL franchise back to their original city. The Gold Miners eventually moved to the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas; where they would play as the San Antonio Texans.|$|E
500|$|Although the Pegasus World Cup {{was only}} three weeks {{prior to the start}} of the Thoroughbred industry's {{breeding}} season, Taylor Made stood California Chrome at stud for the 2017 season. His initial stud fee was set at $40,000, making him the co-second-highest-priced new stallion for the 2017 season. The knee injury was not viewed as a problem, and he was scheduled to begin breeding mares soon after arriving at the farm, starting about February 14. [...] Mark Taylor quipped, [...] "He's going to have like two <b>weeks</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> from the playing field to the penthouse." [...] His book included nine mares purchased by California Chrome LLC, as well as Champagne Royale, the dam of two Grade I winners, including California Chrome's Kentucky Derby rival, Danza.|$|E
500|$|Micelotta {{was still}} {{considered}} a promising prospect in 1956, and spent spring training {{trying to fight}} his way back on the roster. By the end of March, {{with a couple of}} <b>weeks</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> until the season began, he was noted as playing very well, and the Phillies were considering keeping him on the major league roster for the season. He ended up not making the team, and spent the season with the Miami Marlins. During his time with Miami in 1956, Micelotta was known for his defensive plays at the shortstop position, making three good ones in a 61 loss against the Havana Cubans in late May. He finished the season with a [...]236 batting average and 12 home runs in 146 games.|$|E

500|$|By September1905, Northern Pacific {{had already}} {{acquired}} the property {{for the future}} terminal buildings and rail yard—a strip of land two blocks wide, from 10th to 12th avenues, and stretching north from Hoyt Street to the Willamette River. [...] Construction of the railroad itself began in early 1906. [...] The new company needed freight storage and handling facilities in Portland, and to this end it built the two [...] "freight houses" [...] at 11th Avenue and Hoyt Street, in 1908. [...] SP passenger train service was originally expected to terminate at Union Station, located about [...] to the east, but lengthy negotiations between SP and Union Station's operator, the Northern Pacific Terminal Company, eventually reached an impasse. [...] The Terminal Company was only partially owned by SP parent Northern Pacific Railway, and partially by competing railroads. [...] With only a few <b>weeks</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> until passenger service to Portland was to be started, {{it was reported that}} SP would instead equip one of its new freight houses for use as a passenger station, in place of access to Union Station, at least temporarily.|$|E
500|$|In 1990 Jarre {{released}} En Attendant Cousteau (Waiting for Cousteau), {{inspired by}} the French oceanographer Jacques-Yves Cousteau. On Bastille Day 1990 he performed a concert at La Défense in Paris, attended by a record-breaking audience of about two million people, again beating his earlier world record. He later promoted a concert near the Pyramids of Teotihuacan in Mexico, to be held during the solar eclipse of 11 July 1991. However, with only <b>weeks</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> important equipment had not arrived and the sinking in the Atlantic Ocean of a cargo ship containing the purpose-built pyramidal stage and other technical equipment made staging the concert impossible. Jarre's disappointment was such that he [...] "could not cope with Mexican food for two years". About two years later he released Chronologie, an album which was largely influenced by the techno-music scene. From a technical standpoint the album is a reversion to a concept seen in Jarre's Oxygène/Équinoxe period, where a grandiose overture precedes more rhythmic sections. The album features Jarre's traditional collection of instruments like the ARP 2600 and Minimoog, as well as newer synthesisers such as the Roland JD-800 and the Kurzweil K2000.|$|E

2500|$|The {{issue of}} the Boko Haram {{insurgency}} and {{the inability of the}} government to fight the group were closely tied with the country's upcoming presidential elections.

[...] Many analysts and observers expressed similar views, that the downplaying of the attacks by Goodluck, the government, and media outlets supportive of the PDP was intended to reduce the political costs of domestic instability in the election.|$|E
2500|$|Edward III {{seems at}} this point to have been {{primarily}} interested in maintaining the eight counties which Balliol had given him, which he was restoring to military strength. In spite of his flat refusal to meet Philip VI's demands, he was concerned about the potential actions of the French, particularly against his inherited lands in that country. Through the winter, the treaty remained under discussion, promoting the idea that the middle-aged Edward Balliol might retain the throne and David II — who would relocate to England — be named his heir. [...] Philip VI, David II's protector and adviser, had been persuaded by Pope Benedict XII to postpone his own military action, but in March 1336 he persuaded David II to reject the treaty, which evidently his regent had been prepared to accept.
