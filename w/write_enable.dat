This paper presents an experiment in diagnosing defects in the circuitry responsible for the realization of bit, byte or group <b>write</b> <b>enable</b> in memories.

With improvements in VLSI technology, processor speeds have increased. The improvements in SRAM speed of operation with increased integration, bigger sizes, technology shrinking and power dissipation is required to match with improved processor. 2 kb SRAM block is designed and tested for proper read and write operation. The single SRAM cell, the 32 x 32 memory array, along with the decoder circuit, the sense enable and <b>write</b> <b>enable</b> logic, are placed out. The different critical paths of the system, comprising of the row and the column decoder, the column mux and the read-write circuits are recognized and sized to meet the target specifications. Simple model for distributed interconnect delays, is introduced and verified by Cadence simulations, their necessity is demonstrated. The models for the delay of a SRAM are used to determine the array sizes for a SRAM. An analytical delay model is proposed to predict the block size for SRAM; proposed model is based on dynamic strategies for word line charging and bit line discharging. Novel Sense Amplifier (SA) circuit for 2 kb SRAM is presented and analyzed in this work. Sense amplifier using decoupled latch with current controlled architecture is proposed and compared with Current controlled latch SA using 90 nm CMOS technology. Delay and power dissipation in proposed SA is 21. 5 % and 18. 5 % less than that of the current controlled SA. Butterfly architecture that is central decoding scheme is used to make a 2 kb block from 1 kb, after simulations, the maximum operating frequency of the system was found to be 800 MHz...|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} of neuron structures {{is an incredibly}} difficult and complex task that yields relatively low rewards in terms of information from biological forms (either animals or tissue). The structures and connectivity of even the simplest invertebrates are almost impossible to establish with standard laboratory techniques, and even when this is possible it is generally time consuming, complex and expensive. Recent work has shown how a simplified behavioural approach to modelling neurons can allow “virtual” experiments {{to be carried out}} that map the behaviour of a simulated structure onto a hypothetical biological one, with correlation of behaviour rather than underlying connectivity. The problems with such approaches are numerous. The first is the difficulty of simulating realistic aggregates efficiently, the second is making sense of the results and finally, {{it would be helpful to}} have an implementation that could be synthesised to hardware for acceleration. This work presents a VHDL implementation of a neuron model which is verified through simulations of the Caenorhabditis Elegans (C. Elegans) locomotory system. The C. Elegans system is synthesized into hardware showing a massive improvement in simulation time because the hardware design runs in real-time, meaning a 19 second simulation takes 19 seconds vs. the 1. 5 hours taken by the CAD simulation. Logic cells using the VHDL neuron model are produced and verified through simulation to demonstrate the deterministic side of modelling neuronal circuits. The C. Elegans design is then analysed using these neuron logic cells to produce a simple logic version of C. Elegans which produces the same outputs given the same inputs as the Neuron C. Elegans model. Finally the hardware neuron concept was extended to the case of a general purpose programmable neuron array designed to have 100 neurons and 200 synapses The configuration of the neurons and synapses is written to the device over a simple SPI bus, with a second SPI bus used to simultaneously <b>write</b> <b>enable</b> data and read the current states of the neuron outputs. The design was demonstrated to work correctly using the reference C. Elegans design. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
