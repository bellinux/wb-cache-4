5|$|Above is the Great Chamber, an {{impressive}} {{room with a}} barrel ceiling with geometrical plaster decoration featuring John Lyte's arms and those of his wife, Edith Horsey. This ceiling is a rare survival. The <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> the bed displays the royal coat of arms and Tudor roses, signifying Lyte's loyalty to King Henry VIII (whose government Lyte represented in Somerset). The panelling is 17th century, as are the great four poster bed and the tapestries on the walls. Some of the original oak panelling of the room {{may have been used}} {{in the construction of the}} canopy of the bed.|$|E

The excavations revealed rough and small stones in the foundations followed by an ashlar face in the exterior <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> ground. The ASI is presently involved in conservation activities of the wall, providing railings, environmental improvements and lighting of the area, {{at a cost of}} Rs 15 lakhs (US$30,000).|$|E
5|$|Since 2004, new glaciers {{have formed}} on the crater <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> Crater Glacier feeding rock and ice to Crater Glacier below. In addition, {{there are two}} rock glaciers {{to the north of}} the eastern lobe of Crater Glacier and one north of the western lobe. Two of these rock glaciers have merged with the Crater Glacier, with one on the west and one on the east. The other rock glacier on the eastern slopes of the crater wall is very close to {{touching}} the glacier.|$|E

5|$|In {{the centre}} {{room of the}} {{transept}} there is a low slate slab altar stone, with an etched red Chi-Ro emblem, with Alpha and Omega incised. A Chi-ro is an early form of Christogram, and is formed by the super imposition {{of the first two}} letters of the Greek alphabet onto a circle. There is a rough Cornish granite monolith seat and prie-dieu, which with the altar stone are inset with gold-enamelled small tiles by Andrew Rowe. The wall plaster has an incised red line. There is a white glazed tiled floor with red tile border around the two early Celtic crosses. In the south <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> the stone crosses are 1920s/1930s windows representing Saints Padarn, Dewi and (in the centre and above) Teilo. The Padarn window is a single-light window with a standing figure of St Padarn holding a staff and chalice, with a valley and hills behind him. It was given in memory of members of the Bonsall family, and was made by the Heaton, Butler & Bayne, London, around 1930, thus preceding Peter Lord's work on the transept.|$|E
5|$|With {{the recent}} {{volcanic}} activity starting in 2004, the glacier lobes were pushed aside and upward by {{the growth of}} new volcanic domes. The surface of the glacier, once mostly without crevasses, turned into a chaotic jumble of icefalls heavily criss-crossed with crevasses and seracs caused by movement of the crater floor. The new domes have almost separated the Crater Glacier into an eastern and western lobe. Despite the volcanic activity, the termini of the glacier have still advanced, with a slight advance on the western lobe and a more considerable advance on the more shaded eastern lobe. Due to the advance, two lobes of the glacier joined together in late May 2008 and thus the glacier completely surrounds the lava domes. In addition, since 2004, new glaciers have formed on the crater <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> Crater Glacier feeding rock and ice onto its surface below; there are two rock glaciers {{to the north of}} the eastern lobe of Crater Glacier. Crater Glacier is the only known advancing glacier in the contiguous United States.|$|E
5|$|The cathedral {{went through}} periods of {{enlargement}} and renovation following {{the fires of}} 1270 and 1390 that included the doubling in length of the choir, the provision of outer aisles to {{the northern and southern}} walls of both the nave and choir. Today, these walls are at full height in places and at foundation level in others yet the overall cruciform shape is still discernible. A mostly intact octagonal chapterhouse dates from the major enlargement after the fire of 1270. The gable <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> the double door entrance that links the west towers is nearly complete and was rebuilt following the fire of 1390. It accommodates a large window opening that now only contains stub tracery work and fragments of a large rose window. Recessed and chest tombs in both transepts and in the south aisle of the choir contain effigies of bishops and knights, and large flat slabs in the now grass-covered floor of the cathedral mark the positions of early graves. The homes of the dignitaries and canons, or manses, stood in the chanonry and were destroyed by fire on three occasions: in 1270, 1390 and 1402. The two towers of the west front are mostly complete and were part of the first phase of construction. Only the precentor's manse is substantially intact; two others have been incorporated into private buildings. A protective wall of massive proportions surrounded the cathedral precinct, but only a small section has survived. The wall had four access gates, one of which—the Pans Port—still exists.|$|E

40|$|Theme‐bases Session II‐B: Recent Developments in Seismic Engineering DesignTransfer {{structures}} are often adopted in tall building structures to provide open spaces at lower storeys for facilitating various functional uses. However, the complicated interactions of transfer structures and supported shear walls prohibit succinct physical models or design guidelines to rationalise the design process. Significant shear stress concentration on supported shear <b>walls</b> <b>above</b> deformed transfer structure is revealed to critically dominate {{the design of}} the buildings under combined effects of gravity and seismic loads. Without adequate prior knowledge and modelling techniques, engineers could under-design the building by overlooking the effect or adopting an unfavourable structural layout at the preliminary design stage leading to difficulty in subsequent detailed member design. This paper aims at studying the structural behaviours of in-plane loaded coupled shear <b>walls</b> supported <b>above</b> a transfer beam. A comprehensive physical model explaining the causes for such shear concentration is presented, in which the shear concentration on the <b>walls</b> <b>above</b> the transfer level is attributed to the forces induced by slabs and beams to restrain the differential movements of adjacent shear <b>walls</b> <b>above</b> the deformed transfer structure. The controlling parameters, comprising the symmetric and asymmetric shear wall arrangements, positions of supporting columns and transfer beams, and span-to-depth ratio of the transfer beam are identified through parametric studies using elastic finite element models. Remedial measures are highlighted for moderating the detrimental effect of shear concentration on supported <b>walls</b> <b>above</b> the transfer level...|$|R

Their origin was the personal coat of arms of Abbot Theoderich Hagn of the monastery in Lambach, which bore a golden swastika with slanted points on a blue field. The Lambach swastika is probably of Medieval origin.|$|E
25|$|The {{church is}} located near Pirot, about 10 {{kilometers}} west {{at the foot}} of Belava Mountain. It was built on an elevated plateau above the river coast of Nišava, near Staničenje village and the confluence of Temštica, near the main road from Sofia to Niš. In the fresco epitaph located on the west <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> the entrance, it was noted that Arsenije, Jefimija, Konstantin and some others (whose names were erased over the years) constructed and painted the church in 1331 and 1332, at the time of Bulgarian Emperor Joan Asen (Ivan Alexander) and Vidin master Belaur. A narthex with an open wooden porch was added in the 19th century.|$|E
