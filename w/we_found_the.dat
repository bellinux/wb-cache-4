25|$|During Angevin period, Rende was {{entrusted}} to Archbishop-Count of Cosenza. After various events, in 1319 AD <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>the</b> presence of family Migliarese from Rende {{to serve the}} House of Anjou. Giovanni Migliarese was knighted {{during the reign of}} King Robert of Anjou and Godefrido Migliarese was invested of the feud of Malvito. In 1437 Rende, like Calabria, came under the Aragon dominion and was given to the Adorno Family of Genoa in 1442.|$|E

The latter had a strong influence on the album with Rhys stating: [...] "when <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>the</b> harpsichord everything started to go 1960s... and we kind of followed that feeling..." [...] Although Gruff Rhys had initially told fans to expect a [...] "speaker-blowing" [...] LP the addition of instruments such as the harpsichord meant this was not the case; the album instead highlights the band's [...] "musical sweet tooth".|$|E

40|$|Finding {{the global}} {{probabilistic}} {{nature of a}} non-equilibrium circadian clock is essential for addressing important issues of robustness and function. We have uncovered the underlying potential energy landscape of a simple cyanobacteria biochemical network, and the corresponding flux which {{is the driving force}} for <b>the</b> oscillation. <b>We</b> <b>found</b> that <b>the</b> underlying potential landscape for the oscillation in the presence of small statistical fluctuations is like an explicit ring valley or doughnut shape in the three dimensional protein concentration space. <b>We</b> <b>found</b> that <b>the</b> barrier height separating the oscillation ring and other area is a quantitative measure of the oscillation robustness and decreases when the fluctuations increase. <b>We</b> also <b>found</b> that <b>the</b> entropy production rate characterizing the dissipation or heat loss decreases as the fluctuations decrease. In addition, <b>we</b> <b>found</b> that, as <b>the</b> fluctuations increase, the period and the amplitude of the oscillations is more dispersed, and the phase coherence decreases. <b>We</b> also <b>found</b> that <b>the</b> properties from exploring the effects of the inherent chemical rate parameters on the robustness.

Band member Liam Payne called the song [...] "perfect", and Harry Styles said, [...] "When we were recording in the studio we knew instantly that we wanted this track to be our first single." [...] Styles spoke to MTV News, [...] "I think for us we wanted to release something that wasn't cheesy but it was fun.

The body was naked from the waist down and her left breast was exposed. Part of a pair of tights was pulled down to the left ankle. The remainder of her underwear and the other part of her tights was found in the passenger well." [...] The time of death was placed at between 01:00 and 02:00 (1:00 and 2:00a.m.) 5December. In a statement issued at the time, Detective Superintendent John Porter said: [...] "It is 99% certain that the girl was murdered, attacked, chatted to or met by her killer in a matter of seconds after Jenni Savage left her. He could have been waiting, and seen Jenni leave. It is possible that he was actually sitting in Teresa's car, as <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>the</b> nearside [...] door unlocked." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Frozens success doesn't {{benefit from}} a general {{appetite}} for American films in Japan" [...] (as reported by the International Business Times), but according to Akira Lippit of the USC School of Cinematic Arts, there were several factors that constituted this phenomenon: besides the fact that animated films [...] "are held in great regard in Japan, and the Disney brand name {{with all of its}} heritage is extremely valuable", [...] "the biggest reason is the primary audience... 13- to 17-year-old teenage girls." [...] He further explained that audiences of this age range have a vital role in shaping Japanese pop culture and [...] "Frozen has so many elements that appeal to them, with its story of a young girl with power and mystique, who finds her own sort of good in herself." [...] He compared the film's current situation with a similar phenomenon which occurred with Titanic in 1997, [...] "when millions of Japanese teen girls turned out to watch Leonard DiCaprio go under– several times," [...] and thought the same would happen with Frozen. Another reason that contributed to the film's success in the market was that Disney took great care in choosing [...] "high quality" [...] voice actors for the Japanese-dubbed version, since Japan's pop music scene had an important role particularly with teenage audiences. Orika Hiromura, Disney Japan's marketing project leader for Frozen, {{said in an interview with}} The Wall Street Journal: [...] "We really put effort into finding actors who could not only play the role but also belt out the tunes as well. <b>We</b> <b>found</b> <b>the</b> perfect match in Takako Matsu and Sayaka Kanda, and they really added a whole new dimension to the storytelling." ...|$|E
