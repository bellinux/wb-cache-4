5|$|The {{title was}} {{released}} in place of an aborted attempt to port the 2006 game Sonic the Hedgehog to the Wii. Producer Yojiro Ogawa conceived Secret Rings {{to tap into the}} Wii Remote's capabilities. He chose the theme of Arabian Nights, using many elements of the stories in the game's setting, characters, and Middle Eastern-influenced music. Sega changed the title of the game several times, originally being announced as Sonic <b>Wild</b> <b>Fire,</b> before settling on Sonic and the Secret Rings to tie in the theme of Arabian Nights.|$|E

25|$|Warriors: The Prophecies Begin is {{the first}} story arc in the Warriors {{juvenile}} fantasy novel series about anthropomorphic feral cats. The arc comprises six novels which were published from 2003 to 2004: Into the <b>Wild,</b> <b>Fire</b> and Ice, Forest of Secrets, Rising Storm, A Dangerous Path, and The Darkest Hour. The novels are published by HarperCollins under the pseudonym Erin Hunter, which refers to authors Kate Cary and Cherith Baldry and plot developer/editor Victoria Holmes. The sub-series details the adventures of the housecat Rusty, who joins ThunderClan, one of four Clans of feral cats living in a forest which adjoins the human town in which he originally lives. The arc's major themes deal with forbidden love, the concept of nature versus nurture, and characters being a mix of good and bad. Though the novels have appeared on the New York Times Bestseller List and have been nominated for several awards, none of the novels in the Warriors sub-series have won a significant literary award.|$|E
25|$|The {{island was}} {{purchased}} by wealthy stockbroker Charles van Raalte who used the island as a residential holiday retreat. During this time the castle was renovated and served as host to famous visitors such as Guglielmo Marconi. Robert Baden-Powell, {{a close friend of}} the van Raaltes, hosted an experimental camp for boys on the island in the summer of 1907. Brownsea was largely self-supporting, with a kitchen garden and a dairy herd. Many of the pottery factory workers had stayed on after it closed, farming and working for the owners. Charles van Raalte died in Calcutta in 1907 and his wife eventually sold the island in 1925. In 1927 the island was purchased at auction by Mary Bonham-Christie for £125,000. A recluse by nature, she ordered a mass eviction of the island's residents to the mainland. Most of the island was abandoned and gradually reverted to natural heath and woodland. In 1934, a <b>wild</b> <b>fire</b> caused devastation after burning for a week. Much of the island was reduced to ashes, and the buildings to the east were only saved by a change of wind direction. Traumatised by the event, Bonham-Christie banned all public access to the island {{for the rest of her}} life.|$|E

Sega changed the title to Sonic and the Secret of the Rings, then slightly modified it to Sonic and the Secret Rings in August 2006. Sega preferred <b>Wild</b> <b>Fire</b> over Secret Rings, but the latter better fit the game's story and Arabian Nights.|$|E

The land that specifically became the park was purchased from the Central Pennsylvania Lumber Company in 1929 and Mrs. [...] "Doc" [...] Randall in 1931. Worlds End State Park was established by forest ranger John Annabelle in 1932, with a budget of $50 that purchased four picnic tables.|$|E

[...] Another group of structures includes a house, root cellar, and stone storage building. [...] A log house surrounded by a split rail fences makes up the third area. [...] All of the structures on the ranch were built by the Riddle brothers using logs, weatherboard, hand-cut shingles, and local stone.

2500|$|When Parikshit {{raised his}} sword to kill Kali, the sudra {{stripped}} himself of his royal garments and prostrated {{himself at the}} emperor’s feet. The emperor knew Kali tainted the world with his evil and so had no place in it and raised his sword once more. But Kali interceded again and begged the emperor to spare his life and allow him {{a place to live}} within his empire. Parikshit decided that Kali would live in “gambling houses, in taverns, in women of unchaste lives, in slaughtering places and in gold”. And as long as Parikshit ruled India, Kali stayed within the confines of these five places. This act allowed Dharma to regain his legs and the earth to be relieved of much burden. However, Parikshit was later cursed to die by snake bite after hunting in the forest and throwing a dead snake on an unresponsive sage practicing austerities. Upon the emperor’s death, “Kali made his way to other places like <b>wild</b> <b>fire</b> and established his power throughout the length and breadth of the whole world.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Mike Meadows, {{a veteran}} {{photographer}} of the Los Angeles Times, was covering a major <b>wild</b> <b>fire</b> sweeping southern California on 27 October 1993. His {{picture of a}} Los Angeles County firefighter, Mike Alves cooling himself off with water in a pool in Altadena ran both in the Times and nationally. Prior to submitting the photograph for a Pulitzer Prize, Meadows' assignment editor, Fred Sweets, contacted the firefighter, who reportedly {{said he had been}} asked by Meadows to go to the pool and splash water on his head. Meadows denied the accusation, claiming [...] "I may have been guilty of saying this would make a nice shot, but {{to the best of my}} recollection, I did not directly ask him to do that. ... I've been doing breaking news stories for years and years and I've never in my life set up a picture."

2500|$|With {{a lack of}} {{consumer}} confidence in the economic direction given {{by the federal government}} panic started to spread across the country shortly after the Wall Street Crash of 1929. President Hoover retained the Gold Standard as the country’s currency gauge throughout the following years. As a result, the American shareholders with the majority of the gold reserves began to grow wary of the value of gold in the near future. Europe’s decision {{to move away from the}} Gold Standard caused individuals to start to withdraw gold shares and move the investments out of the country or began to horde gold for future investment. The market continued to suffer due to these reactions, and in result caused several of the everyday individuals to speculate on the economy in the coming months. [...] Rumors of market stability and banking conditions began to spread, consumer confidence continued to drop and panic begin to set in. Contagion spread like <b>wild</b> <b>fire</b> pushing Americans all over the country to withdraw their deposits in mass. This idea would continue from 1929-1933 causing the greatest financial crisis ever seen at the banking level pushing the economic recovery efforts further from resolution. An increase in the currency-deposit ratio and a money stock determinant forced money stock to fall and income to decline. This panic-induced banking failure took a mild recession to a major recession.|$|E

50|$|In {{large parts}} of the world, forest fires cover a heavy toll on forests. That can be because of {{provoked}} deforestation in order to substitute forests by crop areas, or in dry areas, because of <b>wild</b> <b>fires</b> occurring naturally or intentionally. A whole section of forest landscape restoration in linked to this particular problem, as in many cases, the net loss of ecosystem value is very high and can open the drop to an accelerated further degradation of the soil conditions through erosion and desertification. This indeed has dire consequences on both the quality of the habitats and their related fauna. Nevertheless, in some specific cases, <b>wild</b> <b>fires</b> do actually allow to increase the biodiversity index of the burnt area, in which case the Forest Restoration Strategies tend to look for a different land-use.|$|R
