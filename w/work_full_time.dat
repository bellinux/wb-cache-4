5|$|While {{living in}} Boston and {{pursuing}} his chosen major, English literature, Marcus began a lifelong hobby of collecting rare and antique books. To finance his pursuits, he began The Book Collector's Service Bureau, a mail-order book service, {{beginning with a}} letter of introduction sent to 100 homes. The venture proved so successful that for a time Marcus considered entering that line of <b>work</b> <b>full</b> <b>time,</b> concerned that entering the retail business might curtail his freedom of expression in politics and other areas of interest; his father persuaded {{him that he would}} always be granted the liberty of his own views, and pointed out that retailing was more profitable and thus would allow him to amass a large book collection that much sooner.|$|E
25|$|Modern children's {{rights issues}} in the United States include child labor laws, {{including}} many agricultural settings where young people {{between the ages of}} 14 and 18 routinely <b>work</b> <b>full</b> <b>time</b> jobs and receive half of the minimum wage. Another common issue is child custody. Laws that make it extremely difficult for non-custodial parents to spend quality time with their children. After two hearings in Congress, children's rights during treatment became a focus.|$|E

However, when Gowariker decided to start filming What's Your Raashee?, Rahman was busy with other projects including Slumdog Millionaire (2008). Gowariker wanted thirteen songs for the film, but Rahman {{did not have time}} to compose them, and they agreed not to work together on the film. The director revealed {{that he did not want}} another established composer because [...] "he wanted someone to <b>work</b> <b>full</b> <b>time</b> on this film for several months." [...] He later chose Sohail Sen, then a newcomer, to compose the soundtrack and the film's score.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} career {{progression}} of NHS doctors, comparing men and women. DESIGN: Postal questionnaire surveys. Participants and setting Graduates of 1977, 1988, and 1993 from all UK medical schools. RESULTS: The {{response rate was}} 68 % (7012 / 10 344). Within general practice, 97 % (1208 / 1243) of men, 99 % (264 / 267) of women who had always <b>worked</b> <b>full</b> <b>time</b> throughout their career, and 87 % (1083 / 1248) of all women were principals. Median times from qualification to principal status were 5. 8 (95 % confidence interval 5. 6 to 6. 0) years for men, 5. 6 (5. 4 to 5. 8) years for women who had <b>worked</b> <b>full</b> <b>time</b> during training, and 6. 8 (6. 5 to 7. 0) years for all women. Of the 1977 and 1988 graduates in hospital practice, 96 % (1293 / 1347) of men were consultants, compared with 92 % (276 / 299) of women who had always <b>worked</b> <b>full</b> <b>time</b> throughout their career and 67 % (277 / 416) of women who had not. Median time to first consultant post was 11. 7 (11. 5 to 11. 9) years for men, 11. 3 (11. 0 to 11. 6) years for women who <b>worked</b> <b>full</b> <b>time</b> during training, and 12. 3 (12. 0 to 12. 6) years for all women. Women who had not always <b>worked</b> <b>full</b> <b>time</b> throughout their career were over-represented in general practice and under-represented in most hospital specialties, substantially so in the surgical specialties and anaesthetics. Women who had always <b>worked</b> <b>full</b> <b>time</b> were under-represented {{not only in the}} surgical specialties but also in general practice. CONCLUSIONS: Women not progressing as far and as fast as men was, generally, a reflection of not having always <b>worked</b> <b>full</b> <b>time</b> rather than their sex. The findings suggest that women do not generally encounter direct discrimination; however, the possibility that indirect discrimination, such as lack of opportunities for part time work, has influenced choice of specialty cannot be ruled out...|$|R

500|$|In 1992 {{the four}} {{surviving}} {{members of the}} original M2WB lineup reunited for a concert in Polson, Montana, with Terry Robinson's brother Bruce Robinson filling in the fifth spot. Additional successful [...] "reunion" [...] concerts followed over the years, becoming more frequent as time passed, with Tim Ryan also filling the spot left by Terry Robinson. Band members also organized a 2012 tribute concert to the Montana band. M2WB now plays semi-regular performances, including some out-of-state in locations such as Lake Tahoe. In 2005 they released their entire recorded output in a box set entitled Private Stash, which included music, DVD recordings of performances, and cover art by Monte Dolack. The band {{was the subject of}} a 2009 PBS documentary, [...] "Never Long Gone: The Mission Mountain Wood Band Story." [...] That year, they also opened for John Fogerty at the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally. The band added singer and songwriter Tim Ryan to the group to fill the position once held by Robinson. They released a new studio album called Reboot in 2011 with a tour in support, and in 2014 a second new album, Now and Then. [...] Though all members continue to play music, only Ryan and Quist individually continue to <b>work</b> <b>full</b> <b>time</b> as musicians, Quist with Great Northern and later with his adult children Guthrie and Halladay in a band they called House of Quist. On August 12, 2017 the band performed another reunion concert in Polson, a tribute to the now-defunct Aber Day Kegger.|$|E

After four years at the University, Novak left it to become a full-time journalist without a degree, {{even though he was}} only one course short of the requirements. In 1993 a college Dean determined that four mandatory physical education classes that Novak had gone through for no credit should constitute enough credit hours, and Novak received his bachelor's degree. Novak later described his academic achievements as [...] "very uneven." [...] He spoke at the university's May 1998 commencement, and in his speech he credited the college for bringing him up from working class immigrant status into the American middle class.|$|E

30|$|Earnings {{effects can}} arise {{due to an}} {{increase}} in the likelihood and duration of employment, hours worked, or wage rates. The fact that the earnings effect in 2005 – 2006, in percentage terms, was about double the employment effect in that same year suggests that the increase in earnings was driven in part by ERA group members working more hours or receiving higher wages. 17 According to data from the 2 -year customer survey, ERA increased the proportion of NDLP participants who <b>worked</b> <b>full</b> <b>time,</b> probably in response to the programme’s retention bonus, which rewarded only full-time work. Data from the 60 -month survey, compared with earlier surveys, indicate that this effect did not persist, as the control group increasingly <b>worked</b> <b>full</b> <b>time</b> and closed the gap.|$|R
