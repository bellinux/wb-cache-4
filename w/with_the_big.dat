5|$|During the decade, {{many smaller}} {{manufacturers}} could not compete <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Three and either {{went out of}} business or merged. In 1954, American Motors was formed when Hudson merged with Nash-Kelvinator Corporation in a deal worth almost $200 million, the largest corporate merger in United States history at that time.|$|E
5|$|Even though Richard's {{statistics}} {{showed he}} bounced between Houston and the minors {{during his first}} four years with the Astros due to his wildness, he often told reporters that racism {{played a role in}} keeping him from becoming a regular <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> club sooner.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, the Insight Bowl {{contracted}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> East {{conference and}} Pacific-10 conference to select teams {{for participation in}} its annual game. Big East champion Miami was awarded an automatic Bowl Championship Series berth, and second-place Pittsburgh accepted a bid to the Continental Tire Bowl in Charlotte, North Carolina. Continental Tire Bowl officials considered inviting Virginia Tech {{to participate in the}} game, but were required to invite Virginia due to the Continental Tire Bowl's contract with the Atlantic Coast Conference. Rather than selecting two teams that faced each other in the final game of the regular season, Continental Bowl officials chose another team. The other possibility for the Hokies was the San Francisco Bowl, whose managers also held a contract <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> East, but because Tech played in the previous year's San Francisco Bowl, the bowl's organizing committee decided against a second invitation.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, The Miz began a {{rivalry with}} MVP {{that began with}} a {{critically}} well-received verbal exchange between the two. The two met in an unadvertised match for the United States Championship at the Royal Rumble event with Miz retaining his title, but in the Royal Rumble match itself MVP eliminated both himself and The Miz. During the rivalry with MVP, Miz began showing signs of an allegiance <b>with</b> <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> Show and on the February 8 episode of Raw, the two defeated champions D-Generation X (Triple H and Shawn Michaels) and The Straight Edge Society (CM Punk and Luke Gallows) to become the Unified WWE Tag Team Champions, making Miz the first wrestler in WWE history to hold three championships {{at the same time}} (U.S., World Tag Team, and WWE Tag Team Champion).|$|E

5|$|The IRFU {{continued}} {{under the}} larger {{auspices of the}} Canadian Rugby Union. Beginning in 1909, the CRU champion was awarded the Grey Cup, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Four competing against university squads and eventually teams from Western Canada. The Argonauts first competed for the Cup in 1911, losing 14 to 7 to the University of Toronto {{in front of a}} then record 13,687 spectators at the newly opened Varsity Stadium. The team would claim their first championship in 1914, exacting revenge on U of T with a 14 to 2 victory. Their star runner and kicker in their first championship year was Jack O'Conner, who scored a league record 44 points.|$|E
5|$|The International Bowl had {{contracts}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> East and Mid-American Conferences {{that allowed}} them to select one team from each conference to participate in their annual game. By virtue of being the Big East champion Cincinnati was awarded an automatic Bowl Championship Series berth; they would play in the 2009 Orange Bowl. The Gator Bowl and Sun Bowl shared the second pick of Big East teams; after the Gator Bowl opted to select Big 12 member Nebraska and the Sun Bowl learned {{that they would not be}} allowed to select Notre Dame, Pittsburgh received the Sun Bowl invitation. The Meineke Car Care Bowl, which had the third selection, picked West Virginia. The fourth, fifth, and sixth selections of Big East teams belonged collectively to the International Bowl, PapaJohns.com Bowl, and St. Petersburg Bowl, which, in consultation <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> East, decided which schools were the best fit for each bowl. There were three remaining bowl-eligible Big East teams: Connecticut, Rutgers, and South Florida. The previous season, Rutgers had played in the International Bowl and South Florida had appeared in the PapaJohns.com Bowl; bowls in general dislike inviting the same team in consecutive years, on the theory that fans are less likely to want to travel to the same destination they were at the year before. Additionally, the St. Petersburg Bowl, in its inaugural year, sought to have local team South Florida play in their game to drive local attendance. Therefore, the teams were apportioned among the bowls as follows: South Florida to the St. Petersburg Bowl, Rutgers to the PapaJohns.com Bowl, and Connecticut to the International Bowl. On December7,2008, UConn formally accepted the bowl invitation, the third in their history.|$|E
5|$|The feud between Bad News Brown and Jake Roberts {{began when}} Roberts sent Brown a {{birthday}} present on the April 22 episode of Wrestling Challenge. Upon opening the package, Brown found a rubber snake; {{it was revealed that}} Brown was afraid of snakes. On the May 5 episode of WWF Superstars, the two men agreed to a match; Brown later claimed that his fear of snakes was cured, although he was quickly proven wrong. On the July 28 episode of WWF Superstars, it was announced that Brown and Roberts face each other at SummerSlam <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Boss Man as a special referee. Brown also announced that he would bring 200 pounds of Harlem sewer rats to counteract Roberts's boa constrictor, Damien.|$|E

5|$|Bama scored {{first with}} field goals of 49 and 34 yards from Leigh Tiffin {{to take an}} early 6–0 lead. The Hokies responded with a 98-yard Dyrell Roberts kickoff return for a {{touchdown}} to give Tech a 7–6 lead. Following the recovery of a Ryan Williams fumble by Brian Selman deep in Hokie territory, the Tide retook the lead 9–7 on a 32-yard Tiffin field goal. Early in the second quarter, Antoine Hopkins intercepted a Greg McElroy pass. On the ensuing possession, Tech led 10–9 after a successful 28-yard Matt Waldron field goal. Alabama responded by driving 76 {{yards for a touchdown}} and a 16–10 lead, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> plays coming on a 14-yard run by Mark Ingram, passes of 16 and 10 yards from McElroy to Julio Jones and the score coming on a 19-yard Roy Upchurch run. On the next Virginia Tech possession, three personal fouls and a pass interference penalty carried the Hokies downfield with Williams scoring on a one-yard touchdown run. The score remained 17–16 at the half after Tiffin missed a 36-yard field goal {{at the end of the}} second quarter.|$|E
5|$|The Barbarian and Haku began teaming in the WWF {{as early}} as 1990, as they were both managed by Bobby Heenan. They feuded <b>with</b> <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> Bossman, interfering in several of his matches to attack him. They made their only {{pay-per-view}} appearance with the WWF at WrestleMania VII, where they lost to The Rockers. They also appeared on several episodes of WWF Prime Time Wrestling in 1991. They faced the Legion of Doom on April 15 but lost when Haku accidentally kicked The Barbarian. The team's miscommunication was a problem again on the July 22 episode when The Barbarian accidentally kicked Haku in a match against The Bushwhackers, causing Haku to get pinned. The Barbarian and Haku were successful the following week, however, when they defeated Sato and Mr. Fuji. The pair left the WWF, but they later teamed in New Japan Pro Wrestling. They challenged The Hell Raisers for the IWGP Tag Team Championship but were unable to win the belts.|$|E

5|$|The Big Bang {{theory is}} the {{prevailing}} cosmological {{model for the}} universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale evolution. The model describes how the universe expanded from a very high density and high temperature state, and offers a comprehensive explanation for {{a broad range of}} phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the cosmic microwave background (CMB), large scale structure and Hubble's law. If the known laws of physics are extrapolated to the highest density regime, the result is a singularity which is typically associated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Bang. Physicists are undecided whether this means the universe began from a singularity, or that current knowledge is insufficient to describe the universe at that time. Detailed measurements of the expansion rate of the universe place the Big Bang at around 13.8 billion years ago, which is thus considered the age of the universe. After the initial expansion, the universe cooled sufficiently to allow the formation of subatomic particles, and later simple atoms. Giant clouds of these primordial elements later coalesced through gravity in halos of dark matter, eventually forming the stars and galaxies visible today.|$|E
5|$|While Carlito was {{recovering}} from an injury, {{he was involved in}} a comical angle with SmackDown!'s general manager, Theodore Long. The storyline consisted of Carlito being forced to do demeaning chores around the arena, such as selling hot dogs, removing snow from parking lots with a shovel and mopping floors. As a result of these actions, Carlito created a petition in support of Long’s destitution, but was unsuccessful. On March 26, 2005, Colón performed {{for the first time in}} six months as Carlito, in a match against his younger brother Eddie Colón during an event in Caguas, Puerto Rico arriving to the stadium in a helicopter and under a massive standing ovation of the thousands of fans gather that night. Carlito made his WrestleMania debut in a non-wrestling role at WrestleMania 21, in which he interrupted an edition of Rowdy Roddy Piper's Piper's Pit, with Stone Cold Steve Austin as the special guest. This event led to an angle in the World Wrestling Council, where Piper and Carlito were booked to wrestle a match on Friday Madness, a special event presented by the company, which Piper won. Following WrestleMania, Carlito created an interview segment entitled Carlito’s Cabana. Carlito then entered a feud <b>with</b> <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> Show after a spot where Show refused an offer to work in an enforcer role for Carlito. This feud involved Carlito tricking Show into eating a poisoned apple, and Matt Morgan becoming Carlito's enforcer. This feud ended with Carlito defeating Show at Judgment Day.|$|E
