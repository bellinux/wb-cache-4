50|$|The cooling {{potential}} for evaporative cooling {{is dependent on}} the <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> <b>depression,</b> the difference between dry-bulb temperature and wet-bulb temperature. In arid climates, evaporative cooling can reduce energy consumption and total equipment for conditioning as an alternative to compressor-based cooling. In climates not considered arid, indirect evaporative cooling can still take advantage of the evaporative cooling process without increasing humidity. Passive evaporative cooling strategies offer the same benefits of mechanical evaporative cooling systems without the complexity of equipment and ductwork.|$|E
50|$|Passive direct {{evaporative}} cooling can occur anywhere that the evaporatively cooled water can cool a space without the assist of a fan. This {{can be achieved}} through use of fountains or more architectural designs such as the evaporative downdraft cooling tower, also called a “passive cooling tower”. The passive cooling tower design allows outside air to flow in through {{the top of a}} tower that is constructed within or next to the building. The outside air comes in contact with water inside the tower either through a wetted membrane or a mister. As water evaporates in the outside air, the air becomes cooler and less buoyant and creates a downward flow in the tower. At the bottom of the tower, an outlet allows the cooler air into the interior. Similar to mechanical evaporative coolers, towers can be an attractive low-energy solution for hot and dry climate as they only require a water pump to raise water {{to the top of the}} tower.Energy savings from using a passive direct evaporating cooling strategy depends on the climate and heat load. For arid climates with a great <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> <b>depression,</b> cooling towers can provide enough cooling during summer design conditions to be net zero. For example, a 371 m² (4,000 ft²) retail store in Tucson, Arizona with a sensible heat gain of 29.3 kJ/h (100,000 Btu/h) can be cooled entirely by two passive cooling towers providing 11890 m³/h (7,000 cfm) each.|$|E

40|$|Direct cooling of {{buildings}} by water evaporation {{has traditionally been}} seen as appropriate, only, in dry and arid climates, which experience high levels of <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> temperature <b>depression.</b> The technique has generally not been applied in maritime climates where low levels of <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> temperature <b>depression</b> are frequently found. However, recent developments in enhancing heat and mass transfer in cooling towers, together {{with the success of}} high temperature sensible cooling systems, such as chilled ceiling panels and beams, have prompted a review of the evaporative cooling technique as an effective and low energy means of cooling modern deep plan buildings, in maritime climates. At present, however, there is little in depth research and analysis of the performance, energy efficiency, and availability of this form of cooling in maritime conditions. To address these issues an experimental research programme has been established with a view to demonstrating the potential and optimising the design of this form of cooling under low approach conditions. This paper presents the results of recent experimental research into the electrical consumption of a prototype inverter controlled cooling tower when generating cooling water at the chilled water temperatures required for chilled ceiling panels and beams, under varying load and <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> temperature approach conditions.

40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 1983 Dr. Peter Jeffrey WattsThis is a field and theoretical study of the evaporation component of the hydrology of an agricultural catchment. The aim {{of the study was}} to improve the evaporation section of the Australian Representative Basis Model, ARBM. ARBM is a physically based computer model of catchment hydrology. It was developed for use in conjunction with the representative Basins Project. The catchment selected for this study was the Warrambine Creek Representative Basin, No. 2. 15. A major part of the study was the development of equipment to directly measure evaporation in the field. Two sets of equipment were developed. One system was based on the energy balance method of evaporation measurement. The other system was based on the eddy correlation method. In its final form, the energy balance equipment proved most satisfactory. At the study site over 100 days of complete data was collected. However this data was discontinuous due to instrument and data recording faults. The data collected was used in the testing of various components of the evaporation model. A detailed analysis was undertaken to estimate the likely errors in the computer values of evaporation. This analysis showed that little error could be expected when evaporation was measured over a wet surface. For a dry surface, the analysis predicted that erratic results could occur. This prediction was confirmed with experimental evidence. The development of the eddy correlation system was less successful. This occurred because of the late start to this section of the work and because of the innovative nature of the equipment which was developed. A microprocessor system was designed to replace the eddy correlation analogue computers. This system offers many advantages over conventional equipment. Unfortunately it was only developed to the laboratory testing stage. Also an infrared hygrometer was designed. This too was only tested in the laboratory. Although no field measurements of evaporation were made with this equipment, additional theory and insight into this method was obtained. The performance of any hydrological model depends on the reliability and representativeness of its input data. This data is supplied by a Bureau of Meteorology climate station situated only 3 km from the study site. The location of the climate station appears to be non-representative of the catchment in general. Thus climatic data from the two sites was compared. Little difference was noted in dry bulb temperature and rainfall data. <b>Wet</b> <b>bulb</b> <b>depressions</b> were slightly different. A poor correlation of pan evaporation was found. It was also found that the global radiation data collected at the climate station was worthless due to an instrument fault. The evaporation model of ARBM was examined in detail. In particular, the parameter known as potential evaporation, PE, was examined from first principles. It was found that PE is poorly defined. PE was re-defined and prediction formulae were derived. These formulae were used in a new PE model for ARBM. The model which predicts the diurnal variation of evaporation was examined and found to be satisfactory. Particular improvements to the equipment and topics of further study were recommended. Open Acces...|$|R

40|$|Evaporative cooling is an {{alternative}} and efficient method of cooling in dry climates. When a liquid evaporates into the surrounding gas, the energy required for the change of phase produces a cooling effect. The <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> <b>depression</b> is the measure of potential for evaporative cooling. Greater the <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> <b>depression</b> greater is the cooling effect, and vice versa. The residential desert cooler, apart from cooling the air increases the humidity of {{the air in the}} room by absorbing moisture from the water supplied to the cooler. This may result in an undesirable increase in humidity level. Allergies is an additional problem with direct evaporative coolers. Indirect evaporative cooling does not have these two drawbacks. In the present work a small indirect evaporative cooler is developed with a cross flow heat exchanger and the performance of the cooler is evaluated under controlled environmental conditions. The results are compared with the results of an analytical model developed by assuming constant water film temperature on the external wall of the heat exchanger tube. The experimental results of the cooler show a satisfactory agreement with the analytical values. Design calculations are presented to show the performance characteristics of indirect evaporative coolers under different temperature and humidity conditions of the ambient. It has been shown that reducing the heat exchanger tube diameter to around 2 mm results in better cooling effect. Climatic conditions of different Indian cities are discussed with respect to the expected effectiveness of indirect evaporative coolers...|$|E

As an alternative form for measuring the <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> globe temperature, algorithms have been created to calculate the <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> globe temperature from basic meteorological observations.

The slow drying nature of Eucalyptus grandis poles makes rapid kiln drying potentially detrimen-tal due to development of defects such as excessive surface checking, honeycomb and collapse. To control these defects {{while maintaining the}} fastest drying rate possible, the effect of drying schedule on the drying quality of E. grandis poles was investigated. Full length pole drying was simulated in thirty 2. 1 m long butt sections of poles of which the top ends were end sealed. Three industrially used schedules that differed in dry and wet bulb temperature and duration of drying (Tdb, Twb and time) were chosen: 80 °C/ 59 °C/ 8 days, 80 °C/ 69 °C/ 10 days and 70 °C/ 59 °C/ 12 days. Surface check length of each pole was measured after drying. Cross-sections cut at the theoretical ground line (TGL), 1. 5 m from the butt end, were {{used to measure the}} moisture content (MC) gradient between the shell and core of poles.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} kiln drying of radiata pine with a primary focus on the change in wood colour that occurs during this process. The energy {{efficiency}} of the drying process has also been examined using computer modelling. The aim of this work was to develop guidelines for commercial wood dryers who wish to produce high quality appearance grade timber in a competitive commercial environment. The colour change in radiata pine wood during kiln drying is mainly caused by sap compounds accumulating at the wood surface and reacting to form coloured compounds. The initial research involved drying experiments designed to determine the relationship between this colour change and the kiln schedule and also measure the accumulation of colour forming compounds. The kinetics of the colour change reaction were also measured using two methods, one in-vitro and the other using small samples of wood. From these experiments a colour change equation was developed that predicts the rate of colour formation based on the drying conditions and this was incorporated into a kiln stack model along with an energy efficiency model. The combined model was used to simulate the drying process to find schedules optimised for energy use and wood quality. The model was also used to simulate the energy efficiency of different humidity control configurations for wood drying kilns. A kiln micro-sensor system was also developed for use in kiln diagnostics and control with the particular aim of identifying areas in wood drying kilns with adverse drying conditions. The recommendation to kiln operators wishing to reduce colour change is to not exceed 70 ? and to use lower relative humidity schedules with a <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> <b>depression</b> of 15 - 20 ?. Operating at lower humidity can increase the energy used by the kiln so it is also recommended that kiln designers incorporate heat recovery into the humidity control mechanisms of the kiln...|$|E
40|$|The {{project has}} {{investigated}} how a separate conditioning chamber can make progressive kilns more efficient. The 2 - zone progressive kilns have a decreasing <b>wet</b> <b>bulb</b> <b>depression</b> {{in the second}} zone, which leads to low moisture spread even without conditioning chamber. With a separate conditioning chamber the capacity can, however, be increased by shortening the drying time. This is possible since the conditioning phase {{can be adapted to}} get a good drying quality without tensions in the cross section of the board. If needed the conditioning chamber can also be used as to extend the drying time which is useful especially when the board dimensions in the kiln is changed. The conditioning face also reduces the moisture spread with 50 % compared to batches from chamber kilns with target moisture content is around 18 %. When the drying is performed in a level of wet bulb temperatures over 60 °C there is less problems with cracks on thicker boards because of the plastic behavior on the wood surface. Progressive kilns with conditioning face can therefore produce greater volumes then from separate chamber kilns with equal quality concerning slicing test gap and even moisture spread. The technical performance of the conditioning chamber was very god on the pilot kiln. The conditioning chamber opens one door on each side when the loading starts, which influence the climate. It was, however, not any problem to get a stable climate after loading/unloading a tray in the conditioning chamber throughout the experiments, but the spray line must be in perfect condition to reach the wet bulb temperature fast enough. Finally the control system to support the kiln operator in his daily work must be developed with more functions when adding a conditioning chamber to the progressive kiln. This system should give some guidance of how to adjust the climate in the conditioning chamber when changing board-dimensions to be able to achieve a good accuracy around the target moisture...|$|E
