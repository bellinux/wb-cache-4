This work investigated six common potassium amino acid solutions: L-proline, sarcosine, glycine, β- alanine, taurine, and L- threonine solutions using <b>wetted-wall</b> <b>column</b> at 313 K and atmospheric pressure (1 bar). We found potassium L-proline solution has significant mass transfer properties similar to 30 wt% MEA. The influence of total pressure in <b>wetted-wall</b> <b>column</b> on CO 2 absorption rate in potassium L-prolinate solutions is determined. It is found that elevated total pressure has {{positive effect on}} CO 2 absorption rate. The CO 2 absorption flux increases approximately by 40 % from 1 bar to 3 bar when CO 2 inlet concentration is 10 %. What's more, the gas side mass transfer coefficient is found not only dependent on the hydrodynamic conditions of <b>wetted-wall</b> <b>column,</b> but also the total pressure in the apparatus. The analytical relations between the hydrodynamic conditions of the column and kg in <b>wetted-wall</b> <b>column</b> at different pressures are got in this work, and the gas mass transfer coefficient kg is found decreases by 86 % from 1 bar to 3 bar...|$|E

We developed a laser triangulation sensor (LTS) set-up for the fast and nondestructive measurement of these biofilm parameters during growth. Using LTS measurements, the morphological development of a dichloromethane-(DCM) degrading biofilm cultured on a <b>wetted-wall</b> <b>column</b> was studied. The measurements show that the biofilm develops faster {{at the entrance of}} the reactor. The biofilm consisted of a base film in which microbial colonies were embedded. The biofilm-surface area gradually increased by 23 % compaerd to the bare surface due to the formation {{of a large number of}} these colonies. The number and shape of these colonies were followed in time. Using LTS measurements, biofilms distinctly different in surface roughness could be distinguished in a laboratory trickling filter removing DCM from a waste gas. The consequences of the observed surface characteristics for the reaction-diffusion process in the biofilm and for the falling film hydrodynamics are discussed...|$|E

Vapor liquid equilibrium measurement shows that the solvent has a lower partial pressure than that of MEA at scrubber temperatures.

Mass transfer coefficients of CO 2 in the solvent system are tested using a <b>wetted-wall</b> <b>column</b> with simulated gases at the scrubber condition.

In this work, we investigated the effect of temperature, sarcosinate concentration, and CO₂ loading on the mass transfer coefficients of CO₂ absorption in a sarcosinate-promoted aqueous ammonia solution on a <b>wetted-wall</b> <b>column.</b> We further investigated the kinetics of the reaction between CO₂ and a blended NH₃/sarcosinate absorbent using stopped-flow spectrophotometric techniques, following the pH changes via coupling to pH indicators. Our study revealed that the mass transfer coefficient for CO₂ absorption in a 3 M ammonia + 1. 5 M sarcosinate blended solution at 288 K is close to that in 5 M monoethanolamine absorbent at 313 K. We did not observe any synergistic or catalytic effects between NH₃ and sarcosinate in the blended solution; the mechanism of the reaction of CO₂ with the NH 3 /sarcosinate mixture is the simple combination of the individual reactions of NH₃ and sarcosinate with CO₂...|$|E

Mass transfer coefficients were also measured for binary mixtures. Both a smooth and a complex surface, similar {{to the surface of the}} structured packing Mellapak, were used in the study.

The overall mass transfer coefficient (KG) and reaction heat (ΔHR) of subject solvents have been measured. Aqueous solution of monoethanolamine (MEA), 2 -amino- 2 -methyl- 1 -propanol (AMP), and KIER-C 3, a newly proposed chemical, {{have been used for}} the study. It was found that KG value of MEA exhibited the highest among the test solvents. The order of KG values with different absorbent solution was found to be ∼ 10 − 10  kmol/m 2 ⋅s⋅Pa or higher. The reaction heats of solvents were obtained from the measurement of heat associated with the absorption reaction between the solution and absorbed CO 2 molecules. The observed value of reaction heat of MEA was ∼ 80  kJ/mol at lower loading or less than 0. 5  mol CO 2 /mol-MEA.

40|$|Piperazine (PZ) {{has been}} {{reported}} as an effective rate promoter in the aqueous ammonia-based solvent process for the post combustion capture (PCC) of CO₂. However, the detailed promotion effect of PZ on CO₂ absorption into partially loaded ammonia solutions and the mechanism of this process are still unclear. In an effort to determine the detailed promotion effect of PZ in aqueous ammonia-based solvents, overall mass transfer coefficients (K G) describing the absorption of CO₂ into aqueous PZ/NH₃ solutions were determined using a <b>wetted-wall</b> <b>column</b> apparatus at 25 °C. The effect of added PZ (from 0 to 0. 5 M) on the mass transfer of CO₂ into 3. 0 M NH₃ solutions over a range of pre-loaded CO₂ concentrations of 0. 9 M at 25 °C are reported in this work. The fast kinetic reactions of CO₂(aq) with blended solutions containing PZ/NH₃ were investigated using stopped-flow spectrophotometry at 25. 0 °C. Analysis of the kinetic measurements using a chemical model which incorporates the complete reaction sets of the individual amines with CO₂ (i. e., NH₃₋CO₂₋H₂O and PZ₋CO₂₋H₂O) resulted in good agreement with the experimental data. The contribution distribution from each reactive species was calculated based on the proposed reaction scheme of the PZ₋NH₃₋CO₂₋H₂O system. Results show that both the PZ/PZH⁺ and PZCO₂̅/PZCO₂H pathways make contributions to the promotion of CO₂ absorption into PZ promoted aqueous NH 3 solutions. Importantly, the reactive piperazine mono-carbamate species, PZCO₂̅/PZCO₂H, which {{is present in the}} CO₂₋loaded mixtures of PZ/NH₃, {{plays an important role in}} the promotion of CO₂ absorption into CO₂₋loaded aqueous NH₃ solutions. The mass transfer simulation results reveal that there are additional reactions occurring in the gas-liquid interface and gas phase due to the volatility of NH₃, which requires further improvement on the simulation model...|$|E
40|$|Aqueous ammonia (NH₃) is {{regarded}} as one of the most cost-effective solvents for carbon dioxide (CO₂) separation processes but suffers from low CO₂ absorption rates and high NH₃ vapor losses which hinder industrial application of this solvent in CO₂ capture from the flue gas of the coal-fired power sectors. In an attempt to address these issues, the effect of adding of potassium sarcosinate (K-SAR) to NH₃ solutions as a rate promoter on CO₂ mass transfer and NH₃ vapor loss in the aqueous NH₃-based post-combustion capture process was investigated in this work. Overall mass transfer coefficients (K G) describing CO₂ absorption and NH₃ vapor loss in 3. 0 M NH₃ and blended 3. 0 M NH₃ solutions containing a wide range of K-SAR concentrations from 0. 0 to 3. 0 M were determined using a <b>wetted-wall</b> <b>column</b> contactor at 15 – 25 °C and CO₂ loadings from 0. 0 to 0. 5 (molCO₂/mol total amine). Additionally, prediction of equilibrium species distribution using fundamental chemical modelling software (ReactLab) in CO₂-loaded NH₃ containing blended solutions were used to explain our experimental results. Addition of K-SAR resulted in significant improvement of K G of CO₂ absorption in NH₃ solutions, but also increased NH₃ vapor losses. The effect of temperature on K G of CO₂ absorption in K-SAR solution was greater than in the NH₃/K-SAR blended solution. The improvement in mass transfer upon addition of K-SAR is due to the faster reaction of CO₂ with K-SAR than with NH₃. The greater loss of NH₃ upon addition of K-SAR can be ascribed to the availability of more free NH₃ and the decrease of solubility of CO₂ and NH₃ in the NH₃/K-SAR blended solution. The investigation of K G of CO₂ and NH₃ vapor losses in NH₃ and other amines (PZ, 1 -MPZ, DEA and MEA) blended solutions also proved the competition for CO₂ is one of the reasons for the increasing of NH₃ vapor losses...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo date, {{a single}} mono-amine solvent with ideal {{properties}} for CO 2 capture processes {{is yet to}} be found. As a compromise, solvent formulations incorporating two or more individual amines into a single solvent blend have been proposed and are gaining momentum as next generation capture solvents. Recently we have identified benzylamine (BZA) for use as a CO 2 capture solvent. A significant drawback with BZA is the formation of stable carbamate salts at high CO 2 loadings which has severely limited the concentration of BZA which can be used. Thus, BZA is ideally placed as a candidate for use in formulations with other amines. In this study, we investigate CO 2 absorption into aqueous solvent blends containing BZA, MEA, sterically hindered, and tertiary amines using a <b>wetted-wall</b> <b>column</b> contactor at 40 oC, and simulations of the vapour liquid equilibrium behaviour of the blends using a software tool developed in Matlab. Overall CO 2 mass transfer coefficients, KG, at 40 oC are reported for blends containing 3. 0 M BZA together with 3. 0 M of the second amine component. Several of the formulations were found to possess significantly faster absorption rates than in standalone MEA solutions at similar total amine concentrations, and CO 2 loadings, as in the blends. A formulation containing BZA and MEA was found to display the fastest CO 2 absorption rates due to the blend containing two fast reacting components. Highly branched and sterically hindered amines in formulations with BZA limit the CO 2 absorption rate due to the parallel impact of the amine structure on the physical properties of these solutions. Absorption capacities at 40 oC are similar in each of the blends with 6. 0 M MEA, however cyclic capacities are significantly higher in the majority of the BZA blends with the largest improvement observed being 92 % in a blend containing 3. 0 M BZA and 3. 0 M AMP. Overall absorption enthalpies in all of the BZA blends here were found to be larger than that observed in standalone MEA due largely to the contribution from the larger protonation enthalpy of BZA...|$|E
