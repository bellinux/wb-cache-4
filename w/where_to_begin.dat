25|$|From the 1880s, {{agents of}} the British, {{especially}} Christian missionaries penetrated the Yoruba interior in an endeavour to end the wars, in particular, the wars of liberation Ekitiparapo communities waged against Ibadan since October, 1879. In June, 1886, political-cum-military officers got the belligerent parties to sign a truce and in March, 1893, Governor Carter of Lagos visited Ibadan and Ekitiparapo camps of Igbajo and Imesi-Ile and terminated the war, got the leaders to sign treaties which prohibited slavery and slave trade, human sacrifices {{and the use of}} weapons to settle conflicts. The British administration in Lagos (which had authority over Yoruba hinterland from 1893) proclaimed a general emancipation for slaves and ordered slaves who so wished to return to their former homelands. As a result, numerous citizens of Ekiti in general and Ado in particular returned from captivity forth with. The British established its colonial rule on vast territories and in 1900, a number of districts became Nigeria. Eventually, further reorganizations led to the creation in January, 1913 of Ekiti District, with headquarters in Ado-Ekiti.

500|$|Breckinridge {{remained}} in Lexington while deciding <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> practice, borrowing law {{books from the}} library of John J. Crittenden, Thomas Crittenden's father. Deciding that Lexington was overcrowded with lawyers, he moved to Frankfort, {{but was unable to}} find an office. After being spurned by a love interest, he and former classmate Thomas W. Bullock departed for the Iowa Territory on October 10, 1841 seeking better opportunities. Journeying westward, they considered settling on land Breckinridge had inherited in Jacksonville, Illinois, but they found the bar stocked with able men like Stephen A. Douglas and Abraham Lincoln. They continued on to Burlington, Iowa, and by the winter of 1842–1843, Breckinridge reported to family members that his firm handled more cases than almost any other in Burlington. Influenced by Bullock and the citizens of Iowa, he identified with the Democratic Party, and by February 1843, he had been named to the Democratic committee of Des Moines County. Most of the Kentucky Breckinridges were Whigs, and when he learned of his nephew's party affiliation, William Breckinridge declared, [...] "I felt as I would have done if I had heard that my daughter had been dishonored." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's opening {{series of}} songs have {{straightforward}} lyrics. On [...] "Back to Love", Bilal flatters his date's shoes and {{is backed by}} a bubbling funk groove. The song draws on the music of Prince, while the jazz guitar licks of [...] "Winning Hand" [...] draw on Steely Dan. [...] "Climbing" [...] has a rugged beat and a lyrical allusion to The Notorious B.I.G.'s 1993 song [...] "Party and Bullshit". The middle section of the album explores broader emotions and themes of loss and lament. [...] "Slipping Away" [...] is a slow-building meditation on loss, with sentimental music backing the narrator's plea to a departing love. On the slow burning pop rock song [...] "Lost for Now", he comes to terms with being alone and leaves town, but finds salvation in [...] "a smile that changes everything" [...] as the song closes with a shimmer of cymbal. The stark ballad [...] "Butterfly" [...] is built around Bilal's soaring falsetto and Glasper's rippling piano. Its music explores jazz, and also features dreamy Moog accents. The album closes with lyrics about the promise of tomorrow: [...] "Woke up this morning {{to the sound of}} a bluebird singing / Suddenly I knew just <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> / Something so simple / How can it speak so loud to me?" ...|$|E
500|$|The season's finale Death And All His Friends {{was highly}} praised. Marsi gave the episode five stars, and {{expressed}} {{that it may}} have been the best episode of the series, adding: [...] "The writing and acting were absolutely stellar, and may lead to many Emmy nominations, but even more impressively, despite a killing spree, it remained distinctly Grey's. Some of the back-and-forths between the characters were truly memorable, and some of the developments so heartbreaking that we don't even know <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> now. Seriously, the Season 6 finale left us laying awake afterward thinking about everything, a feeling we haven't had from Grey's in years and rarely achieved by any program." [...] John Kubicek of BuddyTV also noted that the finale was the best episode, adding: [...] " [...] two of the best hours of television all year. It was certainly the best Grey's Anatomy has ever been, which is saying a lot since I'd written the show off for the past few years. No show does a big traumatic event like Grey's Anatomy, and the shooter gave the show license for heightened drama with five major characters being shot over the two hours. It was emotional, expertly paced and had me in tears for most of the finale." [...] Entertainment Weekly wrote, [...] "At any rate, now you can at least see where it all began. And while you’re still pondering how Grey's can still be so damn good sometimes," ...|$|E

500|$|The song has {{received}} almost universally negative reviews from music critics, for its songwriting, instrumentation, Black's singing voice, and the video choreography. Lyndsey Parker of Yahoo! Music {{asked if it}} could be [...] "the worst song ever." [...] On March 29, 2011, it surpassed Justin Bieber's [...] "Baby" [...] as the most disliked YouTube video, with 1.17 million dislikes, and once had over 3 million [...] "dislikes", accounting for 88% of the total ratings of the video. The video was later removed, although it has since been officially re-uploaded. The co-writer and producer of [...] "Friday", Clarence Jey, said about the song that [...] "the concept we feel seems to have crossed a lot of boundaries, for the better or worse." [...] Observers have called it [...] "bizarre," [...] "inept," [...] and [...] "hilariously dreadful." [...] The song and Black herself were [...] "savaged" [...] on social networks across the Internet, while being seen as a [...] "YouTube laughing stock." [...] On YouTube, the video was met with negative comments and video responses, including comments interpreted as [...] "violent". Kevin Rutherford, a columnist for Billboard magazine, wrote, [...] "Black's video for 'Friday' is one of those rare occurrences where even the most seasoned critics of Internet culture don't know <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin.</b> From the singing straight out of Auto-Tuned hell to lyrics such as 'Tomorrow is Saturday / And Sunday comes afterwards / I don't want this weekend to end' and a hilariously bad rap about passing school buses, 'Friday' is something that simply must be seen and heard to be fully appreciated." [...] Many other reviewers also singled out the lyrics in particular for criticism, which were described as [...] "overly simple and repetitive" [...] by TNT Magazine. Jim Edwards of BNET and Doug Gross of CNN both noted that the rap break from the considerably older rapper was [...] "creepy."

500|$|In November 1996, Björk {{released}} the [...] "often-delayed" [...] remix project Telegram, which contained reworkings of several songs from Post, with her voice re-recorded. Telegram {{has been described}} as [...] "effectively a completely new album". Author Mark Pytlik writes, [...] "Promises of a Post remix album had been circulating since the release of [...] "Army of Me" [...] in April 1995. To compensate, Björk announced the release of a string of 12" [...] remixes beginning in June, limited to only 1,000 copies each. Producers and musicians featured on Telegram include: Dillinja, Eumir Deodato, LFO, and Graham Massey, among others; Björk only remixed [...] "You've Been Flirting Again" [...] herself. The album also contains a new composition, [...] "My Spine", a collaboration with British percussionist Evelyn Glennie. According to CMJ New Music Monthly, musically the album contains [...] "a real and surprising taste for recent trends in dance music". Regarding the release, Björk said: [...] "It's like the core of Post. That's why it's funny to call it a remix album, it's like the opposite. [...] Telegram is more stark, naked. Not trying to make it pretty or peaceable for the ear. Just a record I would buy myself". The singer also declared that the release of Telegram meant {{the end of an era}} consisting of Debut and Post. At the release of the compilation, Björk was already relocating to Spain to produce her next studio album solely by herself. The compilation was well received by music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote, [...] "Telegram works as an excellent introduction to techno for alternative pop fans unsure of <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> exploring." [...] Douglas Wolk of CMJ New Music Monthly felt the music of Telegram was [...] "actually better than Post", describing the tracks as, [...] "well-considered reworkings". The Rolling Stone Album Guide gave the album three and a half stars, and stated it, [...] "shed new light on the songs". Telegram spent five weeks on the Billboard 200 chart, peaking at the 66th spot. In the UK, it peaked at the 59th spot, spending two weeks in the albums chart.|$|E
