[...] "I <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> some one on board who could look after ," [...] he wrote in his diary, [...] "it is a great shame that they should suffer from neglect." [...] On 2 December 1911, after final preparations and loading were completed in Hobart, the Aurora sailed south; she stopped briefly at Macquarie Island, where a wireless relay base was established, and reached the site of the expedition's main base at Cape Denison in Adélie Land, on the Antarctic continent, in early January.|$|E

500|$|Goldfinger {{received}} more positive reviews than Fleming's previous novel, Dr. No, which had faced widespread {{criticism in the}} British media. Writing in The Observer, Maurice Richardson thought that [...] "Mr. Fleming seems to be leaving realism further and further behind and developing only {{in the direction of}} an atomic, sophisticated Sapper." [...] Even when leaving reality behind, however, Richardson considers that Fleming, [...] "even with his forked tongue sticking right through his cheek, ... remains maniacally readable". Richardson picked up on two areas relating to the characters of the book, saying that Goldfinger [...] "is the most preposterous specimen yet displayed in Mr. Fleming's museum of super fiends", whilst, referring to the novel's central character, observed that [...] "the real trouble with Bond, from a literary point of view, is that he {{is becoming more and more}} synthetic and zombie-ish. Perhaps it is just as well." [...] Writing in The Manchester Guardian, Roy Perrott observed that [...] "Goldfinger...will not let [...] close admirers down". Perrott thought that overall [...] "Fleming is again at his best when most sportingly Buchan-ish as in the motoring pursuit across Europe"; he summarised the book by saying that it was [...] "hard to put down; but some of us <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> the good taste just to try." ...|$|E
500|$|Benfica {{started their}} {{season with the}} third {{qualifying}} round of the Champions League, attempting to make their first presence in the group stage since 1998–99. On 10 August, Benfica beat Anderlecht 1–0 after Zlatko Zahovič scored in the 13th minute. When asked why Anderlecht had more goal opportunities than Benfica, Trapattoni said, [...] "Do you know international football? It is very balanced nowadays. I <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> more chances but our opponent was stronger." [...] Following the win, Benfica were due to meet Porto in the Supercup on 20 August. Ricardo Quaresma of Porto scored the only goal {{of the game in}} an individual effort. It was Benfica's tenth consencutive loss in the competition; the previous win occurred in 1989. Four days later, Benfica travelled to Belgium to play Anderlecht. The home team scored first by Aruna Dindane, who scored another on the hour-mark. Nenad Jestrović scored the last goal. Trapattoni blamed fatigue and anxiety for the defeat, saying, [...] "I said we would try to score, but lacked composure to do so. In the first half {{he spent a lot of}} energy. On the second, we tried to fight back, until he conceded a second goal, which killed us." [...] The fans insulted the team on their arrival in Lisbon. On 29 August, Benfica made their debut in the Primeira Liga by visiting Beira-Mar. Two goals in the first half and another within five minutes of the second, gave Benfica a lead that help them beat the locals.|$|E
500|$|As the Republican presidential {{nomination}} race {{went into the}} primaries season, Romney had not endorsed anyone but {{was one of the}} Republican establishment figures who were becoming increasingly concerned about the front-runner status of New York businessman Donald Trump. Romney publicly criticized Trump for not releasing his taxes, saying there might be a [...] "bombshell" [...] in them. Trump responded by calling Romney [...] "one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics." [...] Then Romney gave a speech on March 3, 2016, at the Hinckley Institute of Politics, that represented a scathing attack on Trump's personal behavior, business performance, and domestic and foreign policy stances. He said Trump was [...] "a phony, a fraud ... He's playing members of the American public for suckers" [...] and that [...] "If we Republicans choose Donald Trump as our nominee, the prospects for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished." [...] In response Trump dismissed Romney as a [...] "choke artist". [...] Romney's speech represented an unprecedented attack by a major U.S. party's most recent presidential nominee against the party's current front-runner for the nomination. Romney encouraged Republicans to engage in tactical voting, by supporting whichever of the remaining rivals had the best chance to beat Trump in any given state, and as such Romney announced he was voting for, although not endorsing, Ted Cruz for president prior to the March 22 Utah caucus. [...] As the race went on, there was some evidence of tactical voting occurring, and some partial arrangements were formed among candidates, but by May 3 Trump had defeated all his opponents and became the party's presumptive nominee. [...] Romney then announced that he would not support Trump in the general election, saying, [...] "I am dismayed at where we are now, I <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> better choices".|$|E

2500|$|It {{became a}} ballroom-sized {{room with a}} double-height ceiling full of Renaissance-type frescoes, with Baccarat crystal chandeliers. The carved marble {{fireplace}} was taken from an old Louisiana plantation home. Hill chose parquet flooring and a gold and white color scheme for the entire room. The pianos were placed at one end, with French provincial sofas cushioned by an oriental carpet at the other end. Gold and white silk wall panels concealed shelves for records, music-related books, and Hill's musical instruments. Hill had 108 speakers installed in the room, connected with four miles of wiring. He spent more than $20,000 on the room's sound system. Hill also added a hidden movie screen on which to project his collection of comedy films, which was also hidden {{behind one of the}} silk wall panels.

The highlight of the regular season was a 67-55 road victory over arch-rival and perennial women's basketball power #4 ranked Stanford. Cal's victory broke an 81-game conference winning streak for the Cardinal. Gottlieb led the Bears to a 17-1 conference record, making them Pac-12 Conference co-Champions—the first conference championship in California Women's Basketball history.

2500|$|Like many colleges, Brown {{mandates}} forced medical {{leaves for}} students expressing feelings of self-harm, depression, schizophrenia, {{or other forms}} of mental illness. Controversy arises within the college as to whether Brown follows the US Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, with Brown's own newspaper, The Brown Daily Herald, criticizing the University's policy behind readmission from psychological medical leave. According to a 2010 article in The Brown Daily Herald, even Dean of Student Life & Chair of the Medical Leave Readmission Committee, Maria Suarez, admits that “I <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> more resources to connect with students,” Suarez said. “The support is there, but it is student-initiated.” However, Suarez has been widely criticized within and outside the University as being non-compliant with American ADA laws, often denying students readmission for little to no reason. Moreover, the University leaves students with few guidelines on how to become readmitted; students report that very little communication is made with the University during a leave of absence, and that the University does not aid disabled students in their progress. One mentally disabled student alleges, after 5 semesters of mandatory leave, that: [...] "One of the administrators , he claims, told him: [...] "You should consider yourself lucky because Brown's better than other schools. At least you're not getting kicked out of Brown."' The psychological leave readmission process takes place once every 6 months, and requires only a student's statement and a psychiatrist's or psychologist's statement of well-being, with no interview. Many students report that the process is not thorough enough to judge one's own progress in mental health, thereby violating ADA rights; the denial letters are often short and generic, with one sentence changed at most for multiple denials.|$|E
