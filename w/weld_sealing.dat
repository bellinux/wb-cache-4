To enhance stop valve durability, a new composition for a flux-cored wire was developed, ensuring the generation of the surfacing metal with alloying system Cr-Ni-Mo-Mn-Si-Nb-Ti-B. Such wire provides overall hardening of the coating matrix with carboboride and intermetallic phases, providing an advanced operational {{reliability of}} stop valve nodes operating under friction conditions in aggressive environment...|$|E

40|$|This valve is {{designed}} to create a zero-leak seal in a liquid propulsion system that is a functional replacement for the normally closed pyrovalve. Unlike pyrovalves, Nitinol is actuated by simply heating the material to a certain temperature, called the transition temperature. Like a pyrovalve, before actuation, the upstream and downstream sections are separated from one another and from the external environment by closed <b>welded</b> <b>seals.</b> Also like pyrovalves, after actuation, the propellant or pressurant gas can flow without a significant pressure drop but are still separated from the external environment by a closed <b>welded</b> <b>seal.</b> During manufacture, a Nitinol bar is compressed to 93 percent of its original length and fitted tightly into the valve. During operation, the valve is heated until the Nitinol reaches the transition temperature of 95 C; the Nitinol "remembers" its previous longer shape with a very large recovery force causing it to expand and break the titanium parent metal seal to allow flow. Once open, the valve forever remains open. The first prototype valve was designed for high pressure [5, 000 psi (= 34. 5 MPa) ] and low flow, typical requirements for pressurant gas valves in liquid propulsion systems. It is possible to modify the dimensions to make low-pressure models or high-flow models, for use downstream of the propellant tanks. This design is simpler, lower risk, and less expensive than the pyrovalve. Although the valve must be in a thermally controlled state (kept below 80 C) to prevent premature actuation, the pyrovalves and electrically actuated initiators have far more taxing handling requirements...|$|R

50|$|After {{the strap}} is tensioned, the strap is often sealed to itself. Steel strap is sealed with a seal and notch joint, a seal and crimp, seal-less joint, or via <b>welding.</b> <b>Seals</b> come in various shapes {{depending}} on the application; some can be put on after the strap is tensioned, while others must be installed before tensioning. To create the seal, the seal and strap are notched on both sides; if one set of notches are created then it is called a single notch joint, if two sets of notches are created then it is called a double notch joint. Crimp joints also use a seal, but crimp undulations are used instead of formed notches. These crimps form great frictional forces which keep the joint from seeping. Seal-less joints are created by forming interlocking keys {{into the middle of}} the strap.|$|R

40|$|The {{compactness}} {{and desirable}} thermal characteristics of {{plate heat exchangers}} have made them a strong competing heat exchanger technology in the heating, ventilating, air conditioning and refrigeration industry. The miniaturization of plate heat exchangers has become a focal point of attention in recent research. It is desirable to utilize less material and refrigerant charge to obtain the same heat transfer performance. Pillow plate heat exchangers (PPHEs) consist of wavy plates that are welded together with a certain pattern using spot <b>welding,</b> <b>sealed</b> at the edges, and then inflated in a hydroforming process. The complex wavy structure of the pillow plates creates an excellent heat transfer medium with a fully developed turbulent flow between the plates.

This paper presents a parametric study {{on the effect of}} critical geometrical parameters and flow conditions, on the thermal-hydraulic performance of PPHEs.

It combines the practicality of embryo-containing sterile flexipettes stored safely and securely with 0. 3 ml CBS™ embryo straws possessing <b>weld</b> <b>seals.</b> The cooling and warming rates of this double container system were determined using a data logger. Upon direct plunging into LN 2, the flexipettes cool at an average rate of 1391 °C/min, while warming occurs at an average rate of 6233 °C/min in a 37 °C 0. 5 M sucrose bath. Direct deposition of the flexipette into a warming bath insured a rapid transition between − 100 and − 60 °C to minimize potentially harmful recrystalization associated with devitrification. In conclusion, the μS-VTF system has exhibited higher (p< 0. 05) intact survival, implantation and live birth rates than conventional slow freezing methods. The effective embryo transfer of vitrified blastocysts proved similar to or better than fresh embryo transfer outcomes. The sustained clinical use of μS-VTF has justified a change in our infertility practice.
