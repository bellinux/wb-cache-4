2500|$|The {{physical}} layer net bitrate, information rate, [...] useful bit rate, payload rate, [...] net data transfer rate, coded transmission rate, effective data rate or <b>wire</b> <b>speed</b> (informal language) of a digital communication channel is the capacity excluding the {{physical layer}} protocol overhead, for example {{time division multiplex}} (TDM) framing bits, redundant forward error correction (FEC) codes, equalizer training symbols and other channel coding. Error-correcting codes are common especially in wireless communication systems, broadband modem standards and modern copper-based high-speed LANs. The physical layer net bitrate is the datarate measured at a reference point in the interface between the datalink layer and physical layer, and may consequently include data link and higher layer overhead.|$|E
50|$|The term at <b>wire</b> <b>speed,</b> or the {{adjective}} <b>wire</b> <b>speed,</b> describes any computer system or hardware device that {{is able to}} achieve a throughput equal to the maximum throughput of the communication standard. This requires that the CPU capacity, bus capacity, network switching capacity, etc., be sufficient. Network switches, routers, and similar devices are sometimes described as operating at <b>wire</b> <b>speed.</b> Data encryption and decryption and hardware emulation are software functions that might run at <b>wire</b> <b>speed</b> (or close to it) when embedded in a microchip.|$|E
50|$|In {{computer}} networking, <b>wire</b> <b>speed</b> or wirespeed {{refers to}} the hypothetical peak physical layer net bitrate (useful information rate) of a cable (consisting of fiber-optical wires or copper wires) combined with a certain digital communication device, interface, or port. For example, the <b>wire</b> <b>speed</b> of Fast Ethernet is 100 Mbit/s {{also known as the}} peak bitrate, connection speed, useful bit rate, information rate, or digital bandwidth capacity. The <b>wire</b> <b>speed</b> is the data transfer rate that a telecommunications standard provides at a reference point between the physical layer and the datalink layer.|$|E
30|$|When the <b>wire</b> running <b>speed</b> {{has a lower}} value, the {{amplitude}} slightly increases. The debris {{exclusion from}} the discharge gap is a little difficult at lower <b>wire</b> running <b>speed</b> {{because there is no}} high-speed flow of working fluid around the wire. Then, the debris stagnation occurs around the wire, which causes unstable machining and larger amplitude of wire vibration. When the <b>wire</b> running <b>speed</b> is higher, the debris is smoothly excluded.|$|R
30|$|Dielectric {{flow rate}} is {{the rate at}} which the {{dielectric}} fluid is circulated. Flow rate of the working fluid from jet nozzles is important for efficient machining. One of the forces exerted on the wire is the dielectric flow such that as the flow rate increases around the wire, the movement of the <b>wire</b> <b>speeds</b> up and thus the average wire amplitude increases.|$|R

Design/methodology/approach: Welding experiments were conducted with various <b>wire</b> feed <b>speeds</b> of 0. 5 m/min, 1. 0 m/min, and 1. 5 m/min, and the bead characteristics were evaluated. As shape factors of the weld bead, the bead width, back bead width, and bead cross-section area were measured. According to the weld quality and defined objective functions, the <b>wire</b> feed <b>speed</b> was optimized for various welding <b>speeds.</b> Findings: The <b>wire</b> feed <b>speed</b> that induces the optimum weld quality was found with welding speeds of 0. 5 m/min, 1. 0 m/min, and 1. 5 m/min. The optimum lap welding conditions were then suggested for 1. 6 mm aluminium alloy considering the productivity and quality. Research limitations/implications: The optimization will be extended to various aluminium alloys and the optimized results will be stored in the Al welding database of the intelligent welding power source development. Practical implications: With the increase of the welding speed for aluminium sheet welding, the corresponding <b>wire</b> feed <b>speed</b> should increase as well. On the other hand, {{it is clear that}} the maximum value of the objective function has decreased. Originality/value: This research revealed the relationship between the welding <b>speed</b> and the <b>wire</b> feed <b>speed</b> considering the welding productivity and quality. In addition, the criterion to evaluate the degree of weldability during lap welding is suggested according to the quality and objective functions...|$|R

40|$|The wetting {{behavior}} and interfacial microstructures of molten magnesium AZ 61 alloy {{on the surface}} of two different Q 235 and galvanized steel plates under the condition of cold metal transfer were investigated by using dynamic sessile drop method. The results show that the wetting behavior is closely related to the <b>wire</b> feed <b>speed.</b> Al-Fe intermetallic layer was observed whether the substrate is Q 235 steel or galvanized steel, and the formation of Al-Fe intermetallic layer should satisfy the thermodynamic condition of such Mg-Al/Fe system. The wettability of molten AZ 61 magnesium alloy is improved with the increase of <b>wire</b> feed <b>speed</b> whether on Q 235 steel surface or on galvanized steel surface, good wettability on Q 235 steel surface is due to severe interface reaction when <b>wire</b> feed <b>speed</b> increases, good wettability on galvanized steel surface is attributed to the aggravating zinc volatilization.

40|$|Many Internet {{functions}} require {{classification of}} each packet {{based on a}} number of packet header fields and a set of rules. Packet classification as a general theory problem is inherently hard [5]. While fast network processors have been successfully developed to keep up with <b>wire</b> <b>speeds,</b> the only widening gap between memory access <b>speeds</b> and <b>wire</b> <b>speeds</b> represents an increasingly tough challenge to pure software solutions. Given that, most router vendors favor hardware solutions based on TCAM for its fast and scalable lookup speed. However, as a more complex technology, TCAM is more expensive and more power consuming than RAM-based software solutions. Moreover, TCAM is well known to suffer inefficient range specification [4]. If a rule specifies range clauses on k packet header fields that are m 1 -bit, m 2 -bit, · · ·, mk-bit wide, respectively, it will take up to Qk i= 1 (2 mi − 2) TCAM entries to represent the rule. As <b>wire</b> <b>speeds,</b> the size and complexity of rule sets rapidly increase, a TCAM-based solution where all rules are expressed in TCAMs will become increasingly expensive. To be cost efficient, using a fast but small cache is a natural and appealing option. Researchers [1] have proposed to cache recent incoming packets and the corresponding decision to speed up the classification of succeeding packets. However, an observation is that rule sets are much smaller in size and much more static in composition than the flow population observed by routers. In recent studies [2] from a tier- 1 ISP, it is reported that {{a very small number of}} rules match most of incoming traffic. Therefore, much higher and much more stable hit ratios may be achieved by caching rules instead of caching packets. Notice that stability means robustness against traffic pattern change caused by either malicious attack or other reasons. While the basic idea is conceptually clear, some key prob...|$|R
