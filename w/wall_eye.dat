In his childhood, his home {{was in the}} location of a present-day <b>Wall</b> <b>Eye.</b> Several years prior {{to the beginning of the}} series, he met Yoshikage Kira who insulted Sasame for not being able to choose a profession that took place on land (like a dentist) or in the water (like a fisherman) and instead chose one in between, making him less of a man. Kira also convinced Sasame, who was intoxicated at the time, to eat the fingers off of both of his hands. To take his revenge, Sasame rents the apartment just above Kira's and booby traps Kira's while he's out, filling the bathroom slippers with thumbtacks, putting needles in the towel, adding a razor sharp wire to the bathroom chain, placing a woman under his Stand's thrall in the room, taking several compromising photos to suggest Kira is a pervert, and filling the balcony with venomous snakes, all a means to take control of Kira, only to have Josuke fall into the trap instead. He is the one to reveal Josuke and Kira are not the same people.|$|E

5000|$|Part 8 JoJolion {{introduces}} {{another method}} of obtaining a Stand, interaction with the , strange fault-like structures that have risen from the ground following the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. They disrupt all forms of transportation, communication, and utilities, but all users of Stands have {{come in contact with}} the Wall Eyes at some point. Three (Josuke Higashikata, Yasuho Hirose, and Joshu Higashikata) have all received painful bite marks from their proximity to the Wall Eyes, and the three of them have all developed Stands. Other users of Stands have either fallen into the faults (as with Daiya Higashikata) or grown up in an area where the <b>Wall</b> <b>Eye</b> has erupted later in their life (Ojiro Sasame). A race of Stand-using [...] also appears in JoJolion. These humans seem to innately possess the ability to turn their body into stone and enter a state of suspended animation. They can remain in this state so long as they still have air in their lungs, even if they are submerged in water, otherwise, they will crumble away and die. As a rock, they are impervious to pain from even a Stand-empowered barrage of punches, but damage to their rock body will cause them to bleed. Within Morioh, they appear to have assumed the identities of missing children and have taken names from nearby mountain ranges.|$|E
