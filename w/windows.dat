5|$|As part of Microsoft's {{unification}} strategies, <b>Windows</b> {{products that}} are based on <b>Windows</b> 10's common platform but meant for specialized platforms are marketed as editions of the operating system, rather than as separate product lines. An updated version of Microsoft's <b>Windows</b> Phone operating system for smartphones, and also tablets, was branded as <b>Windows</b> 10 Mobile. Editions of Enterprise and Mobile will also be produced for embedded systems, along with <b>Windows</b> 10 IoT Core, which is designed specifically for use in small footprint, low-cost devices and Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios and is similar to <b>Windows</b> Embedded.|$|E

5000|$|Technically, a reparenting <b>window</b> manager {{registers}} {{with the}} X server {{to be notified}} when a top-level <b>window</b> is mapped (attempts to become visible). When such an event is generated, the <b>window</b> manager creates a frame <b>window,</b> {{and in most cases}} also a title bar <b>window.</b> The frame <b>window</b> then becomes the parent of both the main <b>window</b> and the title bar <b>window.</b> Other forms of decoration, such as buttons, <b>window</b> title, etc., may also be created; these would normally be parented by the title bar <b>window.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>window</b> manager also handles {{icons and}} related visual {{elements}} of the graphical user interface. Icons do not exist {{at the level of}} the X <b>Window</b> core protocol. They are implemented by the <b>window</b> manager. For example, whenever a <b>window</b> has to be “iconified”, the FVWM <b>window</b> manager unmaps the <b>window,</b> and creates a <b>window</b> for the icon name and possibly another <b>window</b> for the icon image. The meaning and handling of icons is therefore completely decided by the <b>window</b> manager: some <b>window</b> managers such as wm2 do not implement icons at all.|$|R

5|$|Critics {{and analysts}} deemed <b>Windows</b> RT to be commercially unsuccessful, citing these limitations, its unclear, uncompetitive {{position}} of sitting as an underpowered system between <b>Windows</b> Phone and <b>Windows</b> 8, {{and the introduction}} of <b>Windows</b> 8 devices with battery life and functionality that met or exceeded that of <b>Windows</b> RT devices. Improvements to Intel's mobile processors, along with a decision by Microsoft to remove OEM license fees for <b>Windows</b> on devices with screens smaller than 9 inches, spurred a market for low-end Wintel tablets running the full <b>Windows</b> 8 platform. These devices largely cannibalized <b>Windows</b> RT; vendors began phasing out their <b>Windows</b> RT devices due to poor sales, and {{less than a year after}} its release, Microsoft suffered a US$900 million loss that was largely blamed on poor sales of the ARM-based Surface tablet and unsold stock.|$|E

5|$|Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE) is an {{antivirus}} software (AV) product that provides protection against {{different types of}} malicious software such as computer viruses, spyware, rootkits and Trojan horses.

5|$|Microsoft Security Essentials is an {{antivirus}} software (AV) product that fights malicious software (malware), including computer viruses, spyware, Trojan horses and rootkits. It replaces <b>Windows</b> Live OneCare, a discontinued commercial subscription-based AV service, {{and the free}} <b>Windows</b> Defender, which until <b>Windows</b> 8 only protected users from adware and spyware. It automatically checks for and downloads the virus definitions it relies on from Microsoft Update, a web-based software service updated three times a day. Users may alternatively download the updates manually from the Microsoft Security Portal website. On 30 September 2011, a faulty definition update caused the product to incorrectly tag Google Chrome as malware. The issue was resolved within three hours. MSE originally ran on <b>Windows</b> XP, <b>Windows</b> Vista and <b>Windows</b> 7, although versions 4.5 and later do not run on <b>Windows</b> XP and Microsoft stopped producing definition updates for <b>Windows</b> XP on 14 July 2015.|$|E
5|$|On December 7, 2016, Microsoft {{announced}} that {{as part of}} a partnership with Qualcomm, it planned to support the PC version of <b>Windows</b> 10 on Qualcomm Snapdragon systems-on-chip in 2017, beginning with a focus on laptops. Unlike <b>Windows</b> RT, these devices will support the use of an x86 processor emulator to support Win32 desktop applications, along with universal apps. On May 2, 2017, Microsoft unveiled <b>Windows</b> 10 S, an edition of <b>Windows</b> 10 designed for low-end mobile devices targeting the education market (which have led critics to compare the product line to Chrome OS). Similarly to <b>Windows</b> RT, it restricts software installation to applications obtained via <b>Windows</b> Store, but it may be upgraded to <b>Windows</b> 10 Pro for a fee to remove these restrictions.|$|E
50|$|X <b>window</b> {{managers}} {{also have}} the ability to re-parent applications, meaning that, while initially all applications are adopted by the root <b>window</b> (essentially the whole screen), an application started within the root <b>window</b> can be adopted by (i.e., put inside of) another <b>window.</b> <b>Window</b> managers under the X <b>window</b> system adopt applications from the root <b>window</b> and re-parent them to <b>window</b> decorations (for example, adding a title bar). Re-parenting {{can also be used to}} add the contents of one <b>window</b> to another. For example, a flash player application can be re-parented to a browser <b>window,</b> and can appear to the user as supposedly being part of that program. Re-parenting <b>window</b> managers can therefore arrange one or more programs into the same <b>window,</b> and can easily combine tiling and stacking in various ways.|$|R
50|$|In the X <b>Window</b> System, the <b>window</b> {{manager is}} a {{separate}} program. X itself enforces no specific <b>window</b> management approach and remains usable even without any <b>window</b> manager. Current X protocol version X11 explicitly mentions the possibility of tiling <b>window</b> managers. The Siemens RTL Tiled <b>Window</b> Manager (released in 1988) {{was the first to}} implement automatic placement/sizing strategies. Another tiling <b>window</b> manager from this period was the Cambridge <b>Window</b> Manager developed by IBM's Academic Information System group.|$|R

5|$|Retail and OEM {{copies of}} <b>Windows</b> 8, <b>Windows</b> 8 Pro, and <b>Windows</b> RT can be {{upgraded}} through <b>Windows</b> Store free of charge. However, volume license customers, TechNet or MSDN subscribers and users of <b>Windows</b> 8 Enterprise must acquire standalone installation media for <b>Windows</b> 8.1 and install through the traditional <b>Windows</b> setup process, either as an in-place upgrade or clean install.

In <b>Windows</b> Server 2012, automated error-correction with integrity streams is only supported on mirrored spaces; automatic recovery on parity spaces was added in <b>Windows</b> 8.1 and <b>Windows</b> Server 2012 R2.

50|$|When a <b>window</b> {{manager is}} running, {{some kinds of}} {{interaction}} between the X server and its clients are redirected through the <b>window</b> manager. In particular, whenever an attempt to show a new <b>window</b> is made, this request is redirected to the <b>window</b> manager, which decides the initial position of the <b>window.</b> Additionally, most modern <b>window</b> managers are reparenting, which usually leads to a banner being placed {{at the top of}} the <b>window</b> and a decorative frame being drawn around the <b>window.</b> These two elements are controlled by the <b>window</b> manager rather than the program.
