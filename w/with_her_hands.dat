5|$|After {{moving to}} Amsterdam, Anne and Margot Frank were {{enrolled}} in school—Margot in public school and Anne in a Montessori school. Margot demonstrated ability in arithmetic, and Anne showed aptitude for reading and writing. Anne's friend, Hanneli Goslar, later recalled that from early childhood, Frank frequently wrote, although she shielded her work <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> and refused to discuss the content of her writing.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, editor Hugh Hefner began {{publishing}} Playboy and {{the magazine}} became popular {{because of its}} early Playmates, such as Mansfield, Marilyn Monroe, Bettie Page, and Anita Ekberg. Mansfield posed nude for the February 1955 issue of Playboy, modeling in pajamas raised so that the bottoms of her breasts showed. This increased the magazine's circulation and helped launch Mansfield's career. Beginning in February 1955, she formed a long-standing relationship with Playboy. Shortly afterward, she posed for the Playboy calendar, covering her breasts <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b> Playboy featured Mansfield every February from 1955 to 1958, and again in 1960.|$|E
5|$|Artwork by Gee Vaucher and Penny Rimbaud, {{including}} {{a recording of}} the original 'Thatchergate Tape', featured {{as part of the}} 'Peculiar People' show at the Focal Point Gallery in Southend on Sea during the Spring of 2016, part of a series of events celebrating the history of 'Radical Essex'. Vaucher's painting 'Oh America', featuring an image of the Statue of Liberty hiding her face <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> was used as {{the front page of the}} UK Daily Mirror newspaper to mark the election of Donald Trump as US President on November 9, 2016. From November 2016 to February 2017 the Firstsite art gallery in Colchester, hosted a retrospective of Gee Vaucher's artwork.|$|E

5|$|Rescue {{workers at}} the World Trade Center site began to {{discover}} body fragments from Flight11 victims {{within days of the}} attack. Some workers found bodies strapped to airplane seats and discovered the body of a flight attendant <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> bound, suggesting the hijackers might have used plastic handcuffs. Within a year, medical examiners had identified the remains of 33victims who had been on board Flight11. They identified two other Flight11 victims, including purser Karen Martin, in 2006, while other unrelated body fragments were discovered near Ground Zero around the same time. In April 2007, examiners using newer DNA technology identified another Flight11 victim. The remains of two hijackers, potentially from Flight11, were also identified and removed from Memorial Park in Manhattan. The remains of the other hijackers have not been identified and are buried with other unidentified remains at this park.|$|E
5|$|The half-length {{portrait}} shows Maria Portinari (born Maria Maddalena Baroncelli in 1456) in a three-quarter view {{turned to}} the left. She has somewhat Nordic features, and is dressed in the high fashion then found {{at the apex of}} Flemish and Italian high society. She is placed against a flat, opaque, dark background, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> clasped in prayer. In Memling's early portraits the backgrounds tend to be plain, as was invariably the case in the work of Jan van Eyck and Roger van der Weyden, and favored within Burgundian court circles. In contrast, Memling's later portraits are set within rich interiors or against landscapes framed by columns, such as in his Portrait of Benedetto Portinari, a fact that has assisted in dating his work.|$|E
5|$|The {{film is a}} {{domestic}} thriller telling of a family's destruction {{by the introduction of}} a sexually predatory femme fatale into the household. A composer has just moved into a two-story house {{with his wife and two}} children. When his wife becomes exhausted from working at a sewing machine to support the family, the composer hires a housemaid to help with the work around the house. The new housemaid behaves strangely, catching rats <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> spying on the composer, seducing him and eventually becoming pregnant by him. The composer's wife convinces the housemaid to induce a miscarriage by falling down a flight of stairs. After this incident, the housemaid's behavior becomes increasingly more erratic. She kills the composer's son, and then persuades the composer to commit suicide with her by swallowing rat poison. The film ends with the composer reading the story from a newspaper with his wife. The narrative of the film has apparently been told by the composer, who then warns the film audience that this is just the sort of thing could happen to anyone.|$|E

25|$|Her {{body was}} {{discovered}} that evening in a garage on East 9th Street <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> bound and her throat slashed. Three years later, Cathy Woods, a mental patient at the Louisiana State University Medical Center, confessed to murdering a woman named Michelle. She was charged and convicted of murdering Michelle Mitchell.|$|E
25|$|Ovid's Metamorphoses {{mentions}} that just before discovering Callisto's pregnancy, Diana washed {{her feet and}} then she and her attendants disrobed. Walter Liedtke {{points out that the}} nymph standing somewhat apart from the group, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> clenched in front of her abdomen, perhaps in contrast with the nymph showing devotion and fidelity by washing feet, may be Callisto. This scene would then illustrate part of that myth narrative, Liedtke asserts, although Wheelock states that the episode seems unrelated to the mood of the painting.|$|E
25|$|Her agility, balance, bodily {{coordination}} and flexibility are at superhuman levels. She can move in manners that surpass {{those of an}} Olympic level gymnast, and has a bone structure allowing great flexibility. She can remain in a crouched position {{for a long time}} and perform contortionist-type feats without causing any damage to her spine. She has an ability to cling to surfaces <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> and feet in a manner similar to Nightcrawler. Her fur provides near-invisibility when in the shadows, and she has excellent vision in dark conditions.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} {{of individuals with}} micropsia are aware that their perceptions do not mimic reality. Many can imagine the actual sizes of objects and distances between objects. It is common for patients suffering from micropsia {{to be able to}} indicate true size and distance despite their inability to perceive objects as they actually are. One specific patient was able to indicate the dimensions of specific objects <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b> She was also able to estimate the distances between two objects and between an object and herself. She succeeded in indicating horizontal, vertical, and 45 degree positions and did not find it difficult to search for an object in a cluttered drawer, indicating that her figure-ground discrimination was intact despite suffering from micropsia.|$|E
25|$|Sculptures of Epona {{fall into}} five types, as {{distinguished}} by Benoît: riding, standing or seated before a horse, standing or seated between two horses, a tamer of {{horses in the}} manner of potnia theron and the symbolic mare and foal. In the Equestrian type, common in Gaul, she is depicted sitting side-saddle on a horse or (rarely) lying on one; in the Imperial type (more common outside Gaul) she sits on a throne flanked by two or more horses or foals. In distant Dacia, she is represented on a stela (now at the Szépmüvézeti Museum, Budapest) in the format of Cybele, seated frontally on a throne <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> on the necks of her paired animals: her horses are substitutions for Cybele's lions.|$|E
25|$|A woman's legs {{can remain}} flat or raised toward her chest, or {{wrapped around the}} {{penetrating}} partner at various heights: {{at the back of}} the legs, at the buttocks or back or over the shoulders, in a position called the Wiener Auster or Viennese oyster. In the higher leg positions the woman's legs may need some support, which may be achieved by crossing the ankles behind the partner or resting on his shoulders. She may also hold them <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> or cross her arms around them at the knees. Some are flexible enough to cross the legs behind their heads. Alternatively, her partner may hold her legs up. Separating straight legs carry the risk of muscle pull of thigh muscles. The laying by the partner on raised legs puts excessive pressure on the woman's back.|$|E

25|$|She and her troupe {{departed}} from Le Havre for America on 15 October 1880, arriving in New York on 27 October. On 8 November, she performed Scribe's Adrienne Lecouvreur at Booth's Theater {{before an audience}} which had paid a top price of $40 for a ticket, an enormous sum at the time. Few in the audience understood French, {{but it was not}} necessary; her gestures and voice captivated the audience, and she received a thunderous ovation. She thanked the audience with her distinctive curtain call; she did not bow, but stood perfectly still, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> clasped under her chin, or with her palms on her cheeks, and then suddenly stretched them out to the audience. After her first performance in New York, she made 27 curtain calls. Although she was welcomed by theater-goers, she was entirely ignored by New York high society, who considered her personal life scandalous.|$|E
25|$|Greek pottery also {{provides}} {{an insight into}} the daily life of prostitutes. Their representation can generally be grouped into four categories: banquet scenes, sexual activities, toilet scenes and scenes depicting maltreatment. In the toilet scenes the prostitute frequently has a less than perfect body; sagging breasts, rolls of flesh, etc. There is a kylix showing a prostitute urinating into a chamber pot. In the representation of sexual acts, {{the presence of a}} prostitute is often indicated by a purse, which underscores the financial nature of the relationship. The position most frequently shown is the leapfrog—or sodomy; these two positions being difficult to visually distinguish. The woman is frequently folded in two <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> flat on the ground. Sodomy was considered degrading for an adult and it seems that the leapfrog position (as opposed to the missionary position) was considered less gratifying for the woman. Finally, a number of vases represent scenes of abuse, where the prostitute is threatened with a stick or sandal, and forced to perform acts considered by the Greeks to be degrading: fellatio, sodomy or sex with two partners.|$|E
500|$|In most {{paintings}} of Kalpavriksha Shiva and Parvati {{are a common}} feature. It forms a [...] canopy over Shiva.

500|$|The {{lyrics of}} the song are a metaphor for fashion and sex. Madonna sings about clothes {{she would like to}} drape over her man, so that she can caress his body <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> and cover him with [...] "Velvet Kisses". According to Rikky Rooksby, author of Madonna: The Complete Guide To Her Music, the line [...] "I'll create a look that's made for you", later became synonymous with Madonna's re-invention of her image {{throughout}} her career.|$|E
500|$|A {{key element}} of Shakur's defense was medical {{testimony}} meant to demonstrate that she was shot <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> up {{and that she would}} have been subsequently unable to fire a weapon. A neurologist testified that the median nerve in Shakur's right arm was severed by the second bullet, making her unable to pull a trigger. Neurosurgeon Dr. Arthur Turner Davidson, Associate Professor of Surgery at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, testified that the wounds in her upper arms, armpit and chest, and severed median nerve that instantly paralyzed her right arm, would only have been caused if both arms were raised, and that to sustain such injuries while crouching and firing a weapon (as described in Trooper Harper's testimony) [...] "would be anatomically impossible".|$|E
500|$|After {{the king}} withdrew, the exultant crowd {{would not be}} denied the same accord from the queen, and her {{presence}} was demanded loudly. Lafayette {{brought her to the}} same balcony, accompanied by her young son and daughter. The crowd ominously shouted for the children to be taken away, and it seemed the stage might be set for a regicide. Yet, as the queen stood <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> crossed over her chest, the crowd – some of whom had muskets leveled in her direction – warmed to her courage. Amid this unlikely development, Lafayette cannily let the mob's fury drain away until, with dramatic timing and flair, he knelt reverently and kissed her hand. The demonstrators responded with a muted respect, and many even raised a cheer which the queen had not heard for quite a long time: [...] "Vive la Reine!" ...|$|E
