25|$|Problems arose {{with the}} <b>web</b> <b>press.</b> The main {{drawback}} was {{its inability to}} sustain long continuous runs compared to the standard (Giori) sheet fed method of intaglio printing, resulting in constant breakdown. In addition, {{the quality of the}} prints were subpar compared to the established method. Due to these factors, the <b>web</b> <b>press</b> was discontinued in July 1996.|$|E
25|$|In May 1991, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) {{installed}} a <b>web</b> <b>press</b> at the Washington, DC printing facilities {{to test a}} new way of printing $1 bills. BEP officials hoped that the test would replace the sheet fed intaglio presses by switching to a possibly quicker and less expensive method of printing. Alexander-Hamilton Web Currency Press was a true web currency press.|$|E
25|$|Between 1992 and 1996, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing experimented {{to see if}} a <b>web</b> <b>press</b> {{that used}} {{continuous}} rolls of paper was quicker and cheaper than intaglio printing, which used flat sheets. The affected notes are dollar bills from Series 1988A, Series 1993 and Series 1995. They are legal tender and are not considered error notes, although they are valuable due to their rarity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Web</b> offset <b>presses</b> are {{beneficial}} in long run printing jobs, typically press runs that exceed ten or twenty thousand impressions. Speed is a determining factor {{when considering the}} completion time for <b>press</b> production; some <b>web</b> <b>presses</b> print at speeds of 3,000 feet (915 meters) per minute or faster. In addition to the benefits of speed and quick completion, some <b>web</b> <b>presses</b> have the inline ability to cut, perforate, and fold.|$|R

50|$|This {{divorced}} {{air motor}} pump design {{eventually lead to}} {{the invention of the}} PileDriver pump series. The same air motors used with larger capacity pump tubes enabled these new pumps to output extremely heavy materials such as mastics, adhesives and sealant. Today, PileDriver pumps are used to pump materials used in the construction of everything from appliances to automobiles. In addition, large printing <b>presses</b> called <b>web</b> <b>presses</b> use Lincoln PileDriver pumps to distribute very heavy ink to the <b>press.</b> <b>Web</b> <b>presses</b> are used by newspapers, magazine publishers and high-volume commercial printers.|$|R
25|$|Reporters are {{journalists who}} {{primarily}} report facts {{that they have}} gathered and those who write longer, less news-oriented articles may be called feature writers. Photographers and graphic artists provide images and illustrations to support articles. Journalists often specialize in a subject area, called a beat, such as sports, religion, or science. Columnists are journalists who write regular articles recounting their personal opinions and experiences. Printers and press operators physically print the newspaper. Printing is outsourced by many newspapers, {{partly because of the}} cost of an offset <b>web</b> <b>press</b> (the most common kind of press used to print newspapers) and also because a small newspaper's print run might require less than an hour of operation, meaning that if the newspaper had its own press it would sit idle most of the time. If the newspaper offers information online, webmasters and web designers may be employed to upload stories to the newspaper's website.|$|E

2500|$|One-dollar {{bills were}} again {{the subject of}} {{experimentation}} in May 1992, when the BEP began to test a web-fed Intaglio printing press. Because of a need for greater quantities of $1 FRN's, the BEP sent out a REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP) (year 1985) NO. BEP-85-73 to procure a web-fed intaglio printing press to dramatically increase the production of currency notes {{within the confines of}} their current (1985) 14th & C street facility. Instead of printing one side of a square sheet of 32 notes at a time, the web-fed press used 96 engraved images or plate-cylinder to print the back of the note, then another 96 image engraved plate-cylinder to print the front of the note. Both sides of notes were printed from a continuous roll of paper. The Alexander-Hamilton intaglio <b>Web</b> <b>press</b> printed both sides of intaglio at the same time. The web-press was actually designed as a full-blown production press as opposed to an experimental press. The notes were issued in Series 1988A, 1993, and 1995. Because of mechanical problems, operator error, as well as the sometimes poor quality of the notes, production was ended in July 1996. [...] Web notes can be identified by the back plate number next to [...] and the removal of face check letters and quadrant numbers.|$|E

5000|$|Web-fed {{refers to}} the use of rolls (or [...] "webs") of paper {{supplied}} to the printing <b>press.</b> Offset <b>web</b> printing is generally used for runs in excess of five or ten thousand impressions. Typical examples of web printing include newspapers, newspaper inserts or ads, magazines, direct mail, catalogs, and books. Web-fed presses are divided into two general classes: coldset (or non-heatset) and heatset offset <b>web</b> <b>presses,</b> the difference being how the inks dry. Cold web offset printing dries through absorption into the paper, while heatset utilizes drying lamps or heaters to cure or [...] "set" [...] the inks. Heatset presses can print on both coated (slick) and uncoated papers, while coldset presses are restricted to uncoated paper stock, such as newsprint. Some coldset <b>web</b> <b>presses</b> can be fitted with heat dryers, or ultraviolet lamps (for use with UV-curing inks), thus enabling a newspaper press to print color pages heatset and black & white pages coldset.|$|R
