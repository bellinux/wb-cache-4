60|$|She was no Syrian queen. She was Mrs. Dr. Kennicott. She fell <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>jolt</b> into a {{whitewashed}} {{hall and}} sat looking at two scared girls {{and a young}} man in wrinkled tights.|$|E
60|$|Then gradually, gently, {{we began}} to slow. Were we slowing to pass the station only? No; <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>jolt</b> she drew up. My heart gave a bound as I read the word 'Dunbar' on the station notice-board.|$|E
60|$|To this Dave did not reply. There {{was another}} turn ahead, and a {{particularly}} hard climb over some rather rough rocks. Then, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>jolt,</b> the big touring-car {{came out on}} the top of the hill. Here was another turn, and then began a sharp descent.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Jarmusch chose a cool palette for the film, accentuated <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{occasional}} <b>jolt</b> of red {{as shown}} {{here by the}} suit of the Night Clerk (Screamin' Jay Hawkins) contrasted with the muted background of the hotel lobby.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{you feel}} well?" [...] Shorty queried anxiously, as Smoke broke a third egg and dexterously thrust him back <b>with</b> <b>a</b> stiff-arm <b>jolt</b> on the breast. [...] "Or {{are you just}} plain loco? That's thirty dollars' worth of eggs already." ...|$|R
6000|$|... [PITT's coach passes, {{drawn by}} {{a troop of}} running men and boy. [...] The Prime Minister is seen within, a thin, erect, up-nosed [...] figure, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> flush of {{excitement}} on his usually pale face. [...] The vehicle reached {{the doorway to the}} Guildhall and halts <b>with</b> [...] <b>a</b> <b>jolt.</b> PITT gets out shakily, and amid cheers enters the [...] building.] ...|$|R
60|$|Unfortunately for {{the young}} hunter, the tree was hollow to its very roots, {{and he went to}} the bottom, {{reaching}} it <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>jolt</b> that made his teeth crack together. His hands were above him and he was wedged in so tightly that he could not bring them down.|$|E
60|$|<b>With</b> <b>a</b> <b>jolt</b> {{it stopped}} before the cottage, and a black-haired giant leaped out {{to run up}} onto the porch. Without a pause he rushed into the house. On the couch lay Clayton. The man started in surprise, but with a bound was {{at the side of}} the {{sleeping}} man.|$|E
60|$|The {{truth was}} that I was simply smiling over some very pretty {{thoughts}} {{that had come to}} me about the roses which were climbing over Mary Gillespie's sill. I meant to inscribe them in the little blank book when I went home. Georgie's speech brought me back to harsh realities <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>jolt.</b> It hurt me, as such speeches always did.|$|E
60|$|The girl's lips came tightly {{together}} until her mouth seemed {{no more than}} a straight line. Her cheeks grew white as death, but her eyes were brave and resolute. She put forth her hand and seized one of the pistols as the carriage <b>with</b> <b>a</b> final <b>jolt</b> came to <b>a</b> standstill.|$|R
50|$|When the Scanner brainwashes a subject, {{it creates}} a {{computerized}} landscape of the subject's mind, representing it as <b>a</b> maze filled <b>with</b> images and items from the subject's life. Representations of the person running the Scanner then run through the maze, altering what they choose. Once the alterations are complete, the subject's new personality is cemented <b>with</b> <b>a</b> massive <b>jolt</b> of electricity.|$|R
5000|$|When Reptar boosts up the Eiffel Tower, {{he stops}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> huge <b>jolt</b> at the top, sending a shrieking Angelica {{flying into the}} sky. The babies catch her but in Reptar's other hand. Angrily, she shouts: [...] "What's the big idea? Are you potty-heads {{trying to get rid}} of me?" [...] With Phil and Lili replaying [...] "That was the big idea" ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{last the}} driver drew up <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>jolt</b> {{in front of}} a long low hut of {{corrugated}} iron, somewhat larger than the rest, but no less dull and dreary. [...] "The hotel," [...] he said briefly; and Guy jumped out to secure himself a night's lodging or so at this place of entertainment, till he could negotiate for a hut and a decent claim, and commence his digging.|$|E
60|$|That was {{the point}} at which his {{reflections}} always came up <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>jolt.</b> He was quite clear about the method of getting ready, but he hadn't the slightest idea of what he was getting ready for. The moment he had redecided to marry Claire, he saw that his only possible future would be celibate machinery-installing in Alaska; and the moment he was content with the prospect of an engineer's camp in Alaskan wilds, his thoughts went crazily fluttering after Claire.|$|E
60|$|Little Dorrit {{was glad}} to be found no fault with, and to see that Fanny was pleased; but her part in the {{procession}} was a musing part, and a quiet one. Sitting opposite her father in the travelling-carriage, and recalling the old Marshalsea room, her present existence was a dream. All that she saw was new and wonderful, but it was not real; it seemed to her as if those visions of mountains and picturesque countries might melt away at any moment, and the carriage, turning some abrupt corner, bring up <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>jolt</b> at the old Marshalsea gate.|$|E
60|$|Then {{he shook}} hands with Grant {{and got into the}} wagon. Edgar cracked the whip and the team plunged forward. <b>With</b> <b>a</b> violent <b>jolting</b> and <b>a</b> rattle of wheels they left the farm behind and drove out on to the prairie. Flora stood {{watching}} them for a while; and then walked back to the house in the gathering dusk with her face set hard and a pain at her heart.|$|R
5000|$|In August 2013, {{researchers}} at the MIT Media Lab developed a USB-connected keyboard accessory that would [...] "punish" [...] users - <b>with</b> <b>a</b> small electric <b>jolt</b> - who {{spent too much time}} on a particular website.|$|R
50|$|There were {{plans to}} release a repaint of Armada Hot Shot called Smokescreen <b>with</b> Mini-Con <b>Jolt,</b> <b>a</b> homage to Generation One Smokescreen in the Universe line. Although prototypes were seen, the toy was never released.|$|R
60|$|This first {{downward}} jump was not vicious--only {{a playful}} one perhaps, {{by way of}} initiating me; but it upset me, and I was dragged in the pine-needles. I did not leap to my feet; I was jerked up. Then began a wild chase down that steep, bushy slope. Cubby got going, and I could no more have checked him than I could a steam-engine. Very soon I saw {{that not only was}} the bear cub running away, but he was running away with me. I slid down yellow places where the earth was exposed, I tore through thickets, I dodged a thousand trees. In some grassy descents it was as if I had seven-league boots. I must have broken all records for jumps. All at once I stumbled just as Cubby made a spurt and flew forward, alighting face downward. I dug up the pine--needles with my outstretched hands, I scraped with my face and ploughed with my nose, I ate the dust; and when I brought up <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>jolt</b> against a log a more furious boy than Ken Ward it would be bard to imagine. Leaping up, I strove with every ounce of might to hold in the bear. But though fury lent me new strength, he kept the advantage.|$|E
6000|$|All out {{of doors}} looked darkly in at him [...] Through the thin frost, almost in {{separate}} stars, [...] That gathers on the pane in empty rooms. [...] What kept his eyes from giving back the gaze [...] Was the lamp tilted near them in his hand. [...] What kept him from remembering what it was [...] That brought him to that creaking room was age. [...] He stood with barrels round him--at a loss. [...] And having scared the cellar under him [...] In clomping there, he scared it once again [...] In clomping off;--and scared the outer night, [...] Which has its sounds, familiar, like the roar [...] Of trees and crack of branches, common things, [...] But nothing so like beating on a box. [...] A light he was to no one but himself [...] Where now he sat, concerned with he knew what, [...] A quiet light, and then not even that. [...] He consigned to the moon, such as she was, [...] So late-arising, to the broken moon [...] As better than the sun in any case [...] For such a charge, his snow upon the roof, [...] His icicles along the wall to keep; [...] And slept. The log that shifted <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>jolt</b> [...] Once in the stove, disturbed him and he shifted, [...] And eased his heavy breathing, but still slept. [...] One aged man--one man--can't fill a house, [...] A farm, a countryside, or if he can, [...] It's thus he does it of a winter night.|$|E
5000|$|Billy Dukes of Taste of Country {{reviewed}} the song favorably, saying that [...] "A catchy chorus infuses “I Know Somebody” <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>jolt</b> of energy {{before the second}} verse brings the roller coaster ride back down for a moment. There are a few non-organic instruments to be found, {{but this is a}} band that’s long been comfortable stretching the definition of country music. Asking LoCash to rely on banjo and fiddle would be like asking George Strait to wear skinny jeans." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 26 December 2010, Boxing Day, a {{swarm of}} more than 32 shallow aftershocks, many centred {{directly}} under the city, occurred throughout the day beginning <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 4.2 <b>jolt</b> at 2:07am. The largest of these, the [...] "Boxing Day aftershock", <b>with</b> <b>a</b> magnitude of 4.9, {{at a depth of}} 12km below Opawa was felt very strongly and caused further damage to at least 20 buildings, the closure of the central city, and cut power to more than 40,000 for some time.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was a hard}} pull, the way back. Encumbered with {{pack and}} two pairs of skees, which they dared not use in the darkness, he could not give her a helping hand. The snow was still falling, not very thick nor savagely wind-borne, yet {{stinging}} their eyes as they crossed open moors and the wind leaped at them. Once Ruth slipped, on a rock or a chunk of ice, and came down <b>with</b> <b>an</b> infuriating <b>jolt.</b> Before he could drop the skees she struggled up and said, dryly: ...|$|R
60|$|Her {{commander}} {{may have}} seen my intentions then, {{but it was too}} late. Almost at the instant of impact I turned my bows upward, and then <b>with</b> <b>a</b> shattering <b>jolt</b> we were in collision. What I had hoped for happened. The cruiser, already tilted at a perilous angle, was carried completely over backward by the impact of my smaller vessel. Her crew fell twisting and screaming through the air to the water far below, while the cruiser, her propellers still madly churning, dived swiftly headforemost after them {{to the bottom of the}} Sea of Omean.|$|R
50|$|Most arrhythmias can be {{effectively}} treated. Treatments may include medications, medical procedures {{such as a}} pacemaker, and surgery. Medications for a fast heart rate may include beta blockers or agents that attempt to restore a normal heart rhythm such as procainamide. This later group may have more significant side effects especially if taken {{for a long period}} of time. Pacemakers are often used for slow heart rates. Those with an irregular heartbeat are often treated with blood thinners to reduce the risk of complications. Those who have severe symptoms from an arrhythmia may receive urgent treatment <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>jolt</b> of electricity in the form of cardioversion or defibrillation.|$|E
5000|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of her first Christmas album, Wrapped in Red (2013), Clarkson, despite her pregnancy, began to record {{material}} for her seventh studio album, with a target release date in 2014. One of these tracks, [...] "Heartbeat Song", is an uptempo synthpop track produced by Greg Kurstin. Lyrically, the song sings of meeting a person who restores someone's faith in love. Sonically, USA Todays Brian Mansfeld remarked that the record serves as sonic defibrillator, starting <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>jolt</b> of melody, its rhythms shifting a couple times before finally settling into its steady pulse; while Idolator's Bradley Stern described its production as Top 40 radio-friendly and remarked that the track sees Clarkson's pulse raising while falling in love above kicky drums, guitars and hints of synths.|$|E
50|$|Following in the {{tradition}} of painters throughout the centuries, Behrens was lured by European cities, villages and hills in search of subject matter. In Behrens' art, which explores the romantic vistas of the Western world, he presents us <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>jolt</b> of recognition orchestrated with a subtlety and drama that highlights the triumph of the human spirit as manifested in merging art and nature. The creative act is not performed by the artist alone; the spectator brings the work in contact with the external world by deciphering and integrating its inner qualifications, and thus adds his contribution to the creative act. Howard Behrens acknowledges that art is, after all, a mirror of life. It remains to be constantly explored, awaiting changes of mood and self in a never-ending growth of perception.|$|E
60|$|The {{approaches}} to Ballarat were beautiful. The features, great green expanses of rolling pasture-land, bisected by eye-contenting hedges of commingled new-gold and old-gold gorse--and a lovely lake. One must {{put in the}} pause, there, to fetch the reader up <b>with</b> <b>a</b> slight <b>jolt,</b> and keep him from gliding by without noticing the lake. One must notice it; for a lovely lake is not as common a thing along the railways of Australia as are the dry places. Ninety-two in the shade again, but balmy and comfortable, fresh and bracing. A perfect climate.|$|R
60|$|When Calico drew {{alongside}} the bay horse and brought Carley breast to breast with Glenn, and then {{inch by inch}} forged ahead of him, Carley pealed out an exultant cry. Either it frightened Calico or inspired him, for he shot right ahead of Glenn's horse. Then he lost the smooth, wonderful action. He seemed hurtling through space {{at the expense of}} tremendous muscular action. Carley could feel it. She lost her equilibrium. She seemed rushing through a blurred green and black aisle of the forest <b>with</b> <b>a</b> gale in her face. Then, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sharp <b>jolt,</b> <b>a</b> break, Calico plunged to the sand. Carley felt herself propelled forward out of the saddle into the air, and down to strike <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sliding, stunning force that ended in sudden dark oblivion.|$|R
5000|$|... "Good Girls Go Bad has {{the magic}} {{to launch the}} members of Cobra Starship into superstardom. The New York dance-punk band powers the single from its third album, [...] "Hot Mess"—stylish enough for a stroll along the boardwalk and rowdy enough for the club. The guy anthem is {{sweetened}} with [...] "Gossip Girl" [...] star Leighton Meester's first musical effort, adding some sass to match Gabe Saporta's energetic vocals. The contagious hook and chorus have a lively group component where the co-eds battle in <b>a</b> call-and-response sing-off. <b>With</b> <b>a</b> similar appeal to No Doubt's [...] "Hey Baby"—minus the reggae but <b>with</b> <b>an</b> accelerated <b>jolt</b> of electro—Cobra Starship has arrived." ...|$|R
5000|$|McKelway came to The New Yorker at {{the behest}} of Harold Ross who [...] "was looking to infuse the {{magazine}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>jolt</b> of gritty reportage." [...] He served as a managing editor for journalistic contributions at The New Yorker from 1936 to 1939. While editor he hired E.J. Kahn, Jr., Joseph Mitchell, Brendan Gill, Philip Hamburger and Margaret Case Harriman. [...] During World War II, he held public relations posts for the Army Air Force, leaving the service with the rank of Lt. Colonel. After the war McKelway returned to The New Yorker and remained at the magazine for 47 years. [...] According to William Shawn, McKelway [...] "was one of the handful of people who, together with Harold Ross, The New Yorker's founding editor, set the magazine on its course." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{vividness}} of {{his writing}} is notable; his language has appeared in several collections of quotations, including this description of Elvis Presley: [...] "The hair was a Vaseline cathedral, the mouth a touchingly uncertain sneer of allure. One, two-wham! Like a berserk blender the lusty young pelvis whirred and the notorious git-tar slammed forward <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>jolt</b> that symbolically deflowered a generation of teenagers and knocked chips off 90 million older shoulders. Then out of the half-melted vanilla face a wild black baritone came bawling in orgasmic lurches. Whu-huh-huh-huh f'the money! Two f'the show! Three t'git riddy naa GO CAAT GO!" [...] This description of Jackie Gleason is also memorable: [...] "Gross in physique, gargantuan in gourmandise, oceanic in liquid capacity, prodigal of purse, a fire hose of libido and a Niagara of comic invention, the man was excess personified {{and one of the}} great entertainers of the age." ...|$|E
5000|$|In the Scrubs season one episode, [...] "My 15 Minutes", Elliot takes a cab {{downtown}} at night. The Mary Tyler Moore theme plays as Elliot {{emerges from}} her cab. She twirls around and tosses her hat {{into the air}} and the music stops <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>jolt</b> when a young man bumps into her. He grabs the hat and sticks it on his head and keeps walking. The Latest Buzz twice parodies the hat toss: in the pilot [...] "The First Issue", Rebecca (one of the new teen writers of Teen Buzz magazine) throws her hat up before leaving the office, which fails to come down; this is revisited in the series finale [...] "The Final Issue" [...] (which involves the staff's firing, similar to the final episode of The Mary Tyler Moore Show), as one of the replacement teen writers, Lucy, does the toss with the same result, down to Rebecca giving the same advice to Lucy that her boss DJ gave to her during her first week on the job after the hat toss mishap.|$|E
6000|$|Halleck woke {{at daybreak}} from the drowse {{into which he}} had fallen. The train was {{creeping}} slowly over the track, feeling its way, and he heard fragments of talk among the passengers about a broken rail that the conductor had been warned of. He turned to ask some question, when the pull of rising speed came from the locomotive, {{and at the same}} moment the car stopped <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>jolting</b> pitch. It settled upon the track again; but the two cars in front were overturned, and the passengers were still climbing from their windows, when Halleck got his bewildered party to the ground. Children were crying, and a woman was led by with her face cut and bleeding from the broken glass; but it was reported that no one else was hurt, and the trainmen gave their helplessness to the inspection of the rotten cross-tie that had caused the accident. One of the passengers kicked the decayed wood with his boot. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I always like a little accident like this, early; it makes us safe the rest of the day." [...] The sentiment apparently commended itself to popular acceptance; Halleck went forward with part of the crowd to see what was the matter with the locomotive: it had kept the track, but seemed to be injured somehow; the engineer was working at it, hammer in hand; he exchanged some dry pleasantries <b>with</b> <b>a</b> passenger who asked him if there was any chance of hiring a real fast ox-team in that neighborhood, in case a man was {{in a hurry to get}} on to Tecumseh.|$|R
5|$|Although its {{equations}} {{of motion}} can be linearized, a bike is a nonlinear system. The variable(s) to be solved for cannot be written as a linear sum of independent components, i.e. its behavior is not expressible as a sum of the behaviors of its descriptors. Generally, nonlinear systems are difficult to solve and are much less understandable than linear systems. In the idealized case, in which friction and any flexing is ignored, a bike is a conservative system. Damping, however, can still be demonstrated: under the right circumstances, side-to-side oscillations will decrease with time. Energy added <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sideways <b>jolt</b> to <b>a</b> bike running straight and upright (demonstrating self-stability) is converted into increased forward speed, not lost, as the oscillations die out.|$|R
50|$|Alabama has {{experienced}} several problematic executions involving the chair. On April 22, 1983, John Louis Evans, the first post-Furman prisoner {{to be executed}} by the state, was hit <b>with</b> <b>an</b> initial <b>jolt</b> of electricity, which lasted 30 seconds. Evans’ body tensed up, causing the electrode on his left leg to snap off. Soon smoke and flames were shooting {{out from under the}} hood that covered his head. When two physicians entered the death chamber they found him still alive. Ignoring Evans' lawyer's plea, <b>a</b> third <b>jolt</b> of electricity was applied and he died. The execution took a total of 14 minutes and his body was left charred and smoldering. In 1989 the state executed Horace Dunkins, who had an IQ of 69 and was convicted of murdering Lynn McCurry. In Dunkins’ execution the first jolt of electricity only knocked him unconscious. Charles Jones, the warden at the time, said that because the jacks connecting the electricity to the chair had been reversed, there was not enough voltage to kill him on the first try. Therefore, it took 19 minutes for Dunkins to die.|$|R
