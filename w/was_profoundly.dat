5|$|After Ueshiba left Hokkaidō in 1919, he met and <b>was</b> <b>profoundly</b> {{influenced}} by Onisaburo Deguchi, the {{spiritual leader of}} the Ōmoto-kyō religion (a neo-Shinto movement) in Ayabe. One of the primary features of Ōmoto-kyō is its emphasis on the attainment of utopia during one's life. This was a great influence on Ueshiba's martial arts philosophy of extending love and compassion especially to {{those who seek to}} harm others. Aikido demonstrates this philosophy in its emphasis on mastering martial arts so that one may receive an attack and harmlessly redirect it. In an ideal resolution, not only is the receiver unharmed, but so is the attacker.|$|E
5|$|Berg's {{observation}} of {{local high school}} students while preparing to film the movie inspired his development {{of some of the}} characters. For example, Jason Street, the character whose promising football career is ended by a spinal injury in the pilot, was inspired by a local event. David Edwards, a football player from San Antonio’s Madison High, was paralyzed during a November 2003 game. Berg was at the game when this accident occurred; he <b>was</b> <b>profoundly</b> affected by Edwards' injury and how it overturned his life. Berg set up a similar incident in the pilot.|$|E

5|$|Honoré de Balzac <b>was</b> <b>profoundly</b> {{influenced}} by Scott (as well as Irish writer Maria Edgeworth), {{and decided to}} write novels using France's turbulent history as a literary backdrop {{in the same way}} they had used the history of Scotland and Ireland. Balzac had previously only published potboiler novels under a variety of pseudonyms, books designed to excite readers and sell copies. He had also engaged in a series of ill-fated speculative investments, which left him in considerable debt. Nevertheless, he believed in his skills as a writer, and awaited success around every corner.|$|E
5|$|The great {{rivalry between}} these two cities may {{have been based on}} more than {{competition}} for resources. Their dynastic histories reveal different origins and the intense competition between the two powers may have had an ideological grounding. Calakmul's dynasty seems ultimately derived from the great Preclassic city of El Mirador while the dynasty of Tikal <b>was</b> <b>profoundly</b> affected by the intervention of the distant central Mexican metropolis of Teotihuacan. With few exceptions, Tikal's monuments and those of its allies place great emphasis upon single male rulers while the monuments of Calakmul and its allies gave greater prominence to the female line and often the joint rule of king and queen.|$|E
5|$|With pessimism for Citadel {{increasing}} {{with each}} delay, in June, Alfred Jodl, the Chief of Staff at the OKW, instructed {{the armed forces}} propaganda office to portray the upcoming operation as a limited counteroffensive. Due to concerns of an Allied landing {{in the south of}} France or in Italy and delays in deliveries of the new tanks, Hitler postponed again, this time to 20 June. Zeitzler <b>was</b> <b>profoundly</b> concerned with the delays, but he still supported the offensive. On 17–18 June, following a discussion in which the OKW Operations Staff suggested abandoning the offensive, Hitler further postponed the operation until 3 July. Finally, on 1 July, Hitler announced 5 July as the launch date of the offensive.|$|E

5|$|As a child, Alfonso Cuarón had a {{predilection for}} space {{programs}} {{and dreamed of}} becoming an astronaut and would watch live moon landings in television. He was 8 years old when Apollo 11 landed on the moon in 1969 and <b>was</b> <b>profoundly</b> influenced by Neil Armstrong. At that time his grandmother bought a new color TV {{in order to be}} able to see the moon landing that was in black and white. He watched space films like A Trip to the Moon (1902) and was further drawn to films featuring the technology of space exploration, and trying to honor the laws of physics such as Marooned (1969) and Woman in the Moon (1929). After Cuarón and his son, Jonás finished the screenplay, Cuarón attempted to develop his project at Universal Pictures, where it stayed in development for several years. After the rights to the project were sold, it began development at Warner Bros.|$|E
5|$|Lutyens <b>was</b> <b>profoundly</b> {{affected}} by the war and sought {{a new form of}} architecture to memorialise the Lost Generation. He generally preferred abstract designs for his war memorials, of which he designed dozens, over allegorical or figurative sculpture or the overt religious imagery that was present in many First World War memorials. Mells {{is one of the few}} monuments in which he used such allegory (in this case, the statue of Saint George). It is the most intricate of Lutyens' civic memorials to feature a statue of Saint George, though his memorial inside Wellington College's chapel features a similar sculpture of George and the Dragon. Fordham War Memorial in Cambridgeshire and Hove War Memorial in East Sussex both feature less intricate bronze statues of George with a sword and shield.|$|E
5|$|Retaining an {{interest}} in class and race-based radicalism, she established contacts with various far right activists in the neighboring United States, including Willis Carto and James K. Warner, the latter being the New York organizer of the American Nazi Party. Warner had earlier attempted to establish Odinism as a religious wing of the American Nazi movement, but having believed {{this to be a}} failure he gave Christensen all of his leftover material on Odinism. It was in this material that Christensen came across the Call of Our Ancient Nordic Religion, a pamphlet authored by the Australian Odinist Alexander Rud Mills. Although Christensen believed that many of Mills' ideas were too heavily influenced by Freemasonry for her liking, she <b>was</b> <b>profoundly</b> influenced by his ideas about reviving the worship of ancient Norse deities. Her approach to the understanding of such deities would be heavily influenced by Jungian psychology, believing that the Norse deities were encoded in a collective unconscious of the white race.|$|E

5|$|The {{story of}} Markham Sutherland is {{presented}} through various letters, journals, and the third-person {{account of the}} novel's supposed editor, Arthur. Sutherland, under pressure from his father to become a clergyman, confesses to Arthur his reservations about accepting the Thirty-Nine Articles and contemporary English Christianity in general. In particular, Sutherland {{is concerned about the}} depiction of God in the Old Testament, God's patronage of the Israelites on non-moral grounds, the doctrine of Eternal Punishment, and the supposed inerrancy of the Bible. Sutherland <b>was</b> <b>profoundly</b> influenced by John Henry Newman in his early years, but was ultimately unable to accept Newman's doctrines. Sutherland also seeks guidance in the writings of Victorian historian and sage Thomas Carlyle (who was Froude's chief intellectual influence in later years), but finds no solutions. Tormented by his doubts and subsequent alienation from his family, Sutherland becomes morbidly depressed.|$|E
25|$|Despite Donahue's {{energetic}} campaigning, it {{soon became}} clear that his candidacy <b>was</b> <b>profoundly</b> limited by his ties to the Kirkland regime. Donahue was forced to defend the status quo and deny the magnitude of the labor movement's problems when he believed otherwise.|$|E

Jews had previously, in large parts of Western Europe, enjoyed a virtual monopoly on the spice trade.|$|E
