This vortex is due to the slow flow coming from inactive duct, which is separate at the top of sharp splitter. A large pressure gradient is observed around the vortex and the low pressure bubble.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{directed}} toward {{the development of a}} bistable <b>wall</b> <b>attachment</b> Flip-Flop device which was capable of directionally controlling particle flow. The particles were transported by a fluid stream which under the influence of <b>wall</b> <b>attachment.</b> The dominant criteria {{in the development of the}} device was the achievement of the highest recovery of particles at the active output, without destroying the <b>wall</b> <b>attachment</b> of the fluid stream The experiment was conducted in several distinct stages; each of which was concerned with at least one aspect of wa 1 l attachment or particle flow. Results derived from one test were used to develop the criteria for the next experimental arrangement. Two experimental models were constructed: one of plywood with only one attachment wall, and one of plexiglas which had two attachment walls and was bistable. The plywood model was used in testing <b>wall</b> <b>attachment</b> and particle recovery as a function of the attachment wall angle. From these tests it was concluded that the optimum wall angle was 18 degrees from the center line of the device. Observations of particle action in the plywood model led to the incorporation of additional features in the plexiglas model. They were: an extended nozzle, the elimination of the separation bubble, and the development of smooth transitions at the corners. The plexiglas model was used to investigate optimum splitter location, the effect of jet velocity on recovery efficiency, the effect of vents on the performance of the device, and the performance of the device using a water jet. In the last stages of testing, moving parts and additional output features were used in conjunction with the bistable device to improve the collection efficiency. Some observations resulting from the data gathered in the various tests include: 1. The higher the jet velocity, the greater the <b>wall</b> <b>attachment.</b> 2. The higher the density and viscosity of the fluid stream the greater the recovery of particles at the active output. 3. Particles with large inertial forces were controlled less by the attached jet stream. The addition 0 f vents in the device may produce greater particle recovery. 5. The use of moving parts and variations in the output leg design can produce 100 percent particle recovery. This study indicated that it was possible to control the directional flow of particles with the bistable <b>wall</b> <b>attachment</b> device which was developed. However, the pure fluid bistable device could not achieve 100 percent recovery of particles. The addition of moving parts or variations in the output leg design can produce 100 percent recovery of the particles. The use of a bistable device could provide simplicity, reliability and adaptability in transporting materials for industrial processes...|$|E

Here we describe a novel collagen-like surface protein, designated SclA (streptococcal collagen-like surface protein). The sclA gene was identified in silico using the Streptococcal Genome Sequencing Project with the recently identified protein GRAB as the probe. SclA has a signal sequence and a cell <b>wall</b> <b>attachment</b> region containing the prototypic LPXTGX motif. The surface-exposed part of SclA contains a unique NH 2 -terminal domain of 73 amino acids, {{followed by a}} collagen-like region. The sclA gene {{was found to be}} positively regulated by Mga, a transcriptional activator of several S. pyogenes virulence determinants. A mutant lacking cell wall-associated SclA was constructed and was found to be as effective as wild-type bacteria in platelet aggregation, survival in fresh human blood, and adherence to pharyngeal cells. The sclA gene was found in all 12 S. pyogenes strains that were investigated using PCR. Sequence analysis revealed that the signal sequence and the cell <b>wall</b> <b>attachment</b> region are highly conserved. The collagen-like domain is variable in its NH 2 -terminal region and has conserved repeated domains in its COOH-terminal part. SclA proteins from most strains have additional proline-rich repeats spacing the collagen-like domain and the cell <b>wall</b> <b>attachment</b> sequence. The unique NH 2 -terminal region is hypervariable, but computer predictions indicate a common secondary structure, with two alpha helices connected by a loop region. Immune selection may explain the hypervariability in the NH 2 -terminal region, whereas the preserved secondary structure implies that this region has a common function. These features and the Mga regulation are shared with the M protein of S. pyogenes. Moreover, as with the gene encoding the M protein, phylogenetic analysis indicates that horizontal gene transfer has contributed to the evolution of sclA...|$|E

Therefore, more precise modeling approach {{is required to}} describe the particles behavior in the system. The {{aim of this study}} was to understand the particle-particle, particle-aggregate, particle-wall, aggregate-aggregate and aggregate-wall mechanism which lead to microfluidics clogging. In the first part of this thesis, aggregation/fragmentation dynamics of hard-gel single size microparticles suspended in a Newtonian liquid owing through a straight channel is studied by numerical simulations. A one-way Discrete Element Method is employed to simulate the motion and the adhesion of the particles. The formation and fragmentation of aggregates, and their deposition at the channel walls are investigated by varying the Reynolds number and the strength of the adhesive force. In addition, a non-periodic channel is considered to simulate the start-up phase of aggregate formation till a `pseudo steady-state' condition. Results in terms of micro-structures, particle velocity profiles, and spatial and temporal evolution of aggregates in 2 D and cylindrical (3 D) channels are presented and discussed, respectively.

Devices with a wedge type splitter(1),(3) are not so good for obtaining higher recovery pressure because of mixing reattached flow with surrounding fluid in the output duct. For avoiding this phenomenon and getting higher recovery pressure, devices with a pentagonal splitter(2),(4) was originated so as to obtain the optimum output duct width free from the position of the splitter tip. As compared with devices with the wedge type splitter, the remarkable merits of devices with the pentagonal splitter are observed. The recovery pressure gaind by closing the output duct is in most cases less 45 % of the supply for devices with the wedge type splitter, but over 45 % for devices with the pentagonal splitter. 　　側壁付着型２安定素子の設計には数多くの変数があって，その設計基準を定めるのは非常に困難である。本報では高い回復圧を得ることを目的として，スプリッタの形を楔形と駒形の 2 通りに変え，その各々に対してベント位置，スプリッタ角を変えて実験を行なった。　　楔形のスプリッタを持つ素子は，出力端で再付着流とまわりの流休とが混り合うために一般的に高い回復圧が得られ難い。ところが駒形のスプリッタを持つ素子は，楔形のスプリッタを持つ素子が起す上記のような現象はなく，下記に示すような著しい利点がみられた。　(1) スプリッタの位置に関係なく出カダクト巾を一定にできるので，統一的な実験が行なえる。　(2) 回復圧が非常に高い（楔形の場合は 45 %以下,駒形の場合ほ 45 %以上）。　(3) メモリタイプの素子が多く得られる。　　又，ベントに関しては， 3 次元方向にベントを開けた場合には，製作が容易であるいう利点があるが，積重ねて使用することができない，回復圧が低くメモリタイプの素子が少ないなどの欠点が多いことから，ペントは 2 次元方向に開けるのが望ましいということがわかった...|$|E

40|$|Metal {{building}} {{systems are}} widely used in low-rise (1 - or 2 -story) building construction for economic reasons. Maximum cost efficiency is usually achieved through optimization of steel weight and the fabrication process by adopting web-tapered members and bolted end-plate connections. However, the cyclic behavior {{of this kind of}} system has not been investigated, and no specific seismic design guidelines are available in the United States. Based on both experimental and analytical studies, this dissertation introduces a new design concept utilizing drift evaluation, and proposes a seismic design procedure for metal building systems. Full-scale cyclic testing on a metal building with web-tapered members demonstrated that the system has high deformability, but little ductility. Proper flange bracing was essential to prevent premature lateral-torsional buckling. Test results also showed that the overstrength of this system was very high since the non-seismic load combination governed the design. A correlation study indicated that the failure modes corresponded well with the strength evaluation contained in the AISC LRFD Specification. Numerical simulation using the finite element analysis program ABAQUS demonstrated that good correlations in both the failure mode and the system strength characteristics could be achieved when a proper assumption on the initial geometric imperfections was made. A parametric study showed that the best correlation was found in the models with the first eigen buckling mode shape and an amplitude of Lb/ 1000 as an initial imperfection (Lb = unbraced length). A drift-based seismic design procedure was then developed. The design goal is to ensure that the elastic drift capacity of the system is larger than the drift demand with a sufficient margin. The drift capacity is calculated using the system overstrength factor, and both drift capacity and demand are estimated utilizing the actual fundamental period. The proposed factor of safety (= 1. 4) partially reflects the influence of low damping nature of metal buildings. Case studies using the proposed design procedure indicated that metal frames with heavy walls (i. e., masonry or concrete) based on the current design procedure are very vulnerable to collapse under major earthquake events, but the impact to the design of typical metal buildings without heavy <b>wall</b> <b>attachments</b> is insignifican...|$|R
40|$|The position-specific (PS) integrins of Drosophila are {{homologous}} {{in structure}} and function to vertebrate integrins, a family of transmembrane receptors that facilitate mechanical linkage and signal transduction between extracellular molecules and the cytoskeleton. Most integrins, including PS integrins, are receptors for components of the extracellular matrix. Integrins are αβ heterodimers, and structural domains within both subunits typically influence ligand specificity. PSI and PS 2 integrins are composed of unique α subunits, α(PS 1) or α(PS 2), and share a common β subunit (β(ps)). myospheroid (mys) encodes β(ps), and the characterization of mys phenotypes indicates that PS integrins function during tissue morphogenesis; e. g., PS integrins are required for adhesion of embryonic muscles to their body <b>wall</b> <b>attachments,</b> and for adhesion between the two surfaces of the pupal wing blade. During metamorphosis, the flat bilayered adult wing blade is formed from a single layered larval wing disc, and removal of PS integrins from this process causes wing "blisters". Since wing morphogenesis is a lengthy and dynamic process, the temporal requirement for integrin function was unclear. Using heatshock inducible mys+ transgenes, the wing blister phenotype of animals with compromised integrin function was rescued. By varying the times of transgene induction, I find that integrin function is required from very early in metamorphosis until at least the last 24 - 48 hours of wing development. Since the inflated (if) gene encodes α(PS 2), characterization of if phenotypes promised to reveal the developmental requirements specific for PS 2. New if lethal alleles were generated and found to retain little or no wildtype UPS 2 function. As seen for mys mutants, if mutant embryos show extreme defects in somatic muscle attachments and in midgut morphogenesis. Unlike mys, however, there is no dorsal herniation in if mutant embryos. With respect to wing morphogenesis, clonal analysis experiments demonstrate that if+ function is required only in cells of the ventral wing surface. To examine the in vivo functions of distinct integrin structures, transgenes were created to express either PS 2 subtype, PS 2 m 8 or PS 2 c. I find that PS 2 m 8 or PS 2 c rescues the if- muscle phenotype. In contrast, ectopic PS 2 m 8 (but not PS 2 c) activity dominantly disrupts wing morphogenesis...|$|R
