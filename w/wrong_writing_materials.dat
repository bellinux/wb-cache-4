The study was educational Research and Development (R & D). The procedure of the study was conducting the needs analysis, writing the course grid, developing the first draft of the supplementary <b>writing</b> <b>materials</b> using task based language teaching, trying out and evaluating the first draft of the supplementary <b>writing</b> <b>materials</b> using task based language teaching by the expert, revising the first draft of the supplementary <b>writing</b> <b>materials</b> using task based language teaching, writing the final draft of supplementary <b>writing</b> <b>materials</b> using task based language teaching. The data from the interview was analyzed qualitatively and the data from the questionnaires were analyzed quantitatively through the descriptive statistics.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} if the application of structured writing principles to the developmental process of complex diversity training materials facilitated training and improved learners 2 ̆ 7 performance in recalling the content. It was hypothesized that structured writing principles would improve the overall effectiveness of the training material. ^ The post-test only experimental design was used in the study to collect data from 166 participants in an undergraduate hospitality management course. The participants were placed into three different groups and received training from three different formats of diversity training materials. These groups were: (1) the prose <b>writing</b> <b>material,</b> (2) the original structured <b>writing</b> <b>material</b> and (3) the revised structured <b>writing</b> <b>material.</b> Upon the completion of reading the materials, participants completed the 32 -item multiple choice post-test. ^ After analyzing the data by one way analysis of variance, the results showed there were significant differences between the post-test scores of the three groups. The average scores of group one, two and three were 19. 23, 21. 67 and 23. 46 respectively from a total possible score of 32 in the post-test. Participants from group three, the revised structured <b>writing</b> <b>material</b> group, performed significantly better than group two, the original structured <b>writing</b> <b>material</b> group, and group one, the prose <b>writing</b> <b>material.</b> Participants from group two, the original structured <b>writing</b> <b>material</b> group performed significantly better than group one, the prose <b>writing</b> <b>material.</b> Therefore, all the hypotheses of this study were supported. The results of the study suggested that implementing structured writing principles in the complex training materials facilitate the learning of participants and their recall abilities. ...|$|R
