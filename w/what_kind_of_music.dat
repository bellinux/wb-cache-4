500|$|For the music, Nakazawa and the game's {{producer}} {{determined the}} amount and variety of tracks based on the budget and the game's content, and told Abo <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> they were imagining for the game. Sasanari was knowledgeable in music, so he helped Nakazawa with discussing the soundtrack. When composing the soundtrack, Abo used {{what he described as}} [...] "geometric music" [...] because of the theoretical and science fiction elements. Prior to composing the music, he read through the game's story, to understand the setting and each character's personality as much as possible. He would write his impressions of the plot, with a focus on the [...] "emotional flow" [...] and the events that occur throughout the story; he valued his first impressions as very important for this. According to Abo, this method takes longer time, but allows him to make better music with a stronger relation to the game's world than if he had just designated different songs to different points of the game. Because he enjoyed the story, the music strongly reflects Abo's own musical tastes.|$|E

[...] AllMusic's Brian O'Neill gave the album three stars, {{calling it a}} [...] "far cry from the party-boy ethos DeLonge is best known for, and he wears the emotional depth well, with songs that are just as hooky as from his bread-winning main squeeze." [...] A reviewer for Q admitted that the musicians [...] "confound expectations with a very good record." [...] The positive reception of the album was {{in contrast to the}} reviews for Blink, which were often negative.

500|$|Films such as Star Wars, Alien, Blade Runner, , and Starship Troopers were {{significant}} {{influences on the}} atmosphere and artistic qualities of the game. The team chose Jack Wall, who also penned the music for BioWare's 2005 title Jade Empire, as the main composer of Mass Effect due to his ability to produce {{a wide range of}} musical styles. Hudson had a clear idea of <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> he wanted in the game, but gave Wall certain artistic freedom to express himself. According to Wall, the main vision was to [...] "marry the electronic instrument palatte [...] of the late 70's/early 80's with more organic elements." [...] Wall had never written this style of music before, but composer Sam Hulick helped him develop the electronic sound on a classic orchestral foundation. By the end of the project, composers Richard Jacques and David Kates joined Wall and Hulick to finish the score on time. While a total of 110 minutes of music was written for the game, all in-game and cinematic music was crafted as multiple stems to maximize their use and variety. The game went gold on October 22, 2007.|$|E

Another seminal release {{in the development of}} grunge was the Deep Six compilation, released by C/Z Records in 1986. The record featured multiple tracks by six bands: Green River, Soundgarden, Melvins, Malfunkshun, Skin Yard, and The U-Men. For many of them it was their first appearance on record. The artists had [...] "a mostly heavy, aggressive sound that melded the slower tempos of heavy metal with the intensity of hardcore". The recording process was low-budget; each band was given four hours of studio time. As Jack Endino recalled, [...] "People just said, 'Well, <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> is this? This isn't metal, it's not punk, What is it?' [...] People went 'Eureka! These bands all have something in common.'" [...] Later that year Bruce Pavitt released the Sub Pop 100 compilation and Green River's Dry As a Bone EP as part of his new label, Sub Pop. An early Sub Pop catalog described the Green River EP as [...] "ultra-loose GRUNGE that destroyed the morals of a generation". Sub Pop's Bruce Pavitt and Jonathan Poneman, inspired by other regional music scenes in music history, worked to ensure that their label projected a [...] "Seattle sound", reinforced by a similar style of production and album packaging.

Eighteen months later, Black moved to Los Angeles, found her manager and was signed to Virgin Records two weeks later. Recording under the pseudonym Porcelain and the Tramps, Black worked with Tommy Henriksen and John Lowery in London while at Virgin. However, she and the label could not agree on the music she made. Virgin wanted Black to record pop music in the vein of Avril Lavigne, despite already knowing <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> she made when signing her. She also faced skepticism from her collaborators who questioned her desire to mix industrial rock sounds with dance pop. Black began posting the songs she recorded on Myspace, gaining upwards of 10 million views {{in a matter of}} months. Black co-wrote and sang backup vocals for the song [...] "Lunacy Fringe" [...] by The Used. She was approached by Courtney Love on MySpace to provide backing vocals for a solo album she was working on. She also was featured on a song by the Street Drum Corps's [...] "Action!". [...] "How Do You Love Someone?", co-penned by Black, Billy Steinberg, and Josh Alexander around the time Black left Virgin, was recorded by Ashley Tisdale for her second album, Guilty Pleasure. Black was initially reluctant to give the song away, but relented and later got to record the song for her own album with production from RedOne.|$|E

She is filling in at McKinley High School for the ailing Spanish teacher Will (Matthew Morrison), who is also director of the glee club, New Directions. Club member Kurt (Chris Colfer), who had seen her perform [...] "Conjunction Junction" [...] when she subbed for his English class, asks her to also take over Will's glee club rehearsals. Instead of assigning songs, Holly asks the club members <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> {{they would like to}} perform, and when Puck (Mark Salling) suggests [...] "Forget You", she sings the song and they all join in, except for Rachel (Lea Michele). Holly later wins her over by asking Rachel what she would like to sing that she hasn't been able to, and they perform a number from Chicago together. Holly bonds with Sue (Jane Lynch), who is the acting principal with Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) also out sick, and Sue fires the still-ailing Will, making Holly the full-time director of the glee club. When he recovers, Will confronts Holly at school, but she is unwilling to give up her new position. She later discovers she is in over her head when Mercedes (Amber Riley) gets in trouble, and Holly turns to Will for help. She reveals that she was once a more serious teacher like Will until a student punched her in the face, at which point she became far more free spirited. Holly ultimately returns to substitute teaching and Will is reinstated. He assigns the glee club to perform [...] "Singin' in the Rain" [...] on his return, but faced with their dismay at being given another old song, he asks for Holly's help to modernize it, and they all perform a mash-up of it with Rihanna's [...] "Umbrella".|$|E

Rolling Stone described it as [...] "an extravagantly abrasive album full of grinding electro, pummeling minimalist hip-hop, drone-y wooz and industrial gear-grind." [...] Slant Magazine critic Ted Scheinman described the album as [...] "built on alien, angular beats, slowly morphing drones and sirens, abrupt periods of silence, and a pulse-quickening style of delivery from Yeezy himself," [...] writing that West reconceives the [...] "notion of <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> (or noise) can underpin hip-hop." [...] According to Charles Aaron of Spin, Yeezus is [...] "a hip hop album, not a rap album", because of how its sounds and subject matter are assembled together, and although listeners can hear [...] "'punk' or 'post-punk' or 'industrial'" [...] throughout, [...] "hip-hop has always been about noise and dissonance and dance music as agitation". The album also incorporates elements of industrial and trap music. The record [...] "most closely resembles" [...] 1990s industrial rock, during which the genre had a significant pop culture impact, with artists such as Nine Inch Nails, Ministry, and Marilyn Manson gaining success. The industrial scene created a [...] "vast global underground community," [...] and Esquire notes {{that one of its}} epicenters was in Chicago, where West was raised. Evan Rytlewski of The A.V.

The aim of {{this essay}} is to {{contribute}} to the knowledge about one of Sweden's greatest religious events during the late Middle Ages, the translation of Catherine of Sweden. By collecting and examining the chants used at Catherine's translation it is possible to see <b>what</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> was used at this occasion and also to determine some thing about how and why these chants were chosen By using manuscripts containing the chants which are close to the occasion in time and place, the melodies and texts are presented in the versions most likely to have been those used in the translation. The results are presented in transcripts of the melodies and texts of the chants and also a discussion about why these songs were chosen. I have determined four different categories of chants: 1) The "regular" chants that were often used at greater religious feasts, 2) "chants of or for the saints", 3) chants with special connection to Catherine and 4) chants for the day of Petrus ad vincula. The religious aspects of the chosen chants are also discussed. ...|$|R

Moreover, cultural contexts influence practices and educational systems. Investigating education policies and their implementation in the United States and the Republic of Korea would shed light on music teacher training in each context, and help officials understand and diagnose local problems. The purpose of this study was to analyze documented policies and procedures for music teacher licensure programs in two countries, to explore their implementation, and investigate candidates’ learning during both programs. The perspectives of two types of knowledge, subject matter knowledge and general pedagogical knowledge, also guided the study. Massachusetts policies and regulations were analyzed. Tito University in Massachusetts and Quinn University in the ROK were selected. Document analysis, individual interviews with professors, and focus group interviews with student teachers in licensure programs in each context were employed. Both Massachusetts and the ROK required music teacher candidates to possess knowledge and skills in Western Classical music. While Massachusetts regulations included <b>what</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> and music education knowledge teacher candidates must have, the ROK regulations indicated how many credits teacher candidates must complete in music, music education, and general education areas. In both contexts, interviews with professors revealed that these programs followed policies and standards of the national, state, and accrediting agencies. In planning curriculum, all professors must consider policies. However, at Tito, professors reported paying closer attention to training students in classroom expertise, whereas Quinn professors paid closer attention to preparing students for the national exam. Teacher candidates wanted to have more field-based experiences in both contexts, although students in Massachusetts worked at practice for a longer period than those in the ROK. Candidates at Tito needed to learn a variety <b>of</b> <b>music</b> from other traditions besides Western Classical music. Candidates at Quinn were overwhelmed due to preparation for The Examination. Individual policy interpretation produced different outcomes. Further research is needed regarding implementation of policies in other licensure programs...|$|R

40|$|Is there a {{specific}} tradition of songs within the swedish environmental movement? <b>What</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> has been performed in different situations {{and what does}} it mean to the movement and its inner life? The essay deals with a town meeting and action against plans of establishing passenger flights at a former military airport in Uppsala, looking at the action as a performance and as a ritual. The second part of the essay is built on interviews of three veterans of the movement's organisations one of which is as a singer-songwriter originally active in the peace movement of the 60 's. The paper is about the songs and the situations in which they were sung, concluding that there is, the limited material considered, little evidence of considerable transfer of songs within the movement, though some coherence exists. The connection to between environmental movement and the swedish radical <b>music</b> movement <b>of</b> the 70 's is also slightly mentioned. Finally there is a reasoning about songs and their different functions and the songs as an important part of a movement's narrative.

The research consisted <b>of</b> eight individual <b>music</b> therapy lessons with two multicultural people from different cultural backgrounds with dementia. The methods used in this master thesis are a qualitative and exploratory case study and participatory observations. The data material for this study are recordings <b>of</b> the <b>music</b> therapy lessons and conversations with the clients dependents before and after the music therapy project. In the analysis three units were discovered: communication, identity and relation. In the discussion part it was discovered that music therapy could be a starter for communication with multicultural people with dementia, and contribute to take care of the clients cultural and musical identity...|$|R
40|$|In the 1960 s, as {{the styles}} of {{counterculture}} psychedelia {{came to be}} incorporated into many parts of mainstream visual culture including advertising, what remained of its initial liberatory promise? In album cover design, light shows, and psychedelic artwork these visual vocabularies of typically hallucinatory experiences were the counterpart to contemporary music, both experimental and popular, that used electronic guitar and vocal effects, as well as tape loops and early synthesizers, to generate sonic qualities evoking the effects of hallucinogens. At the same time, popular and underground music samples were being used by experimental and commercial film, like Bruce Conner’s Looking for Mushrooms, Dennis Hopper’s Easy Rider, Barbet Schroder’s More, or Jud Yalkut’s Turn! Turn! Turn! as soundtracks for works with explicit hallucinatory imagery. How effectively did music and imagery complement one another to facilitate a comprehensive immersion into quasi-hallucinatory experiences or even serve as aids to experimentation with hallucinogens? What were the circumstances for image montage, stroboscopic light effects, and rotating mandala forms to become the visual tropes accompanying drug-referencing <b>music?</b> Alternately, <b>what</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> were optimally used to accompany imagery, particularly in films, about drugs? Is it possible to identify an alternative aesthetics developing from within this plethora <b>of</b> immersive <b>music</b> and imagery, given that the abandonment of analytical criticality seems intended? An unlikely outcome perhaps, without his prior composition Mescaline Mix, Terry Riley’s 1964 In C amplified zones of sensory pleasure newly accessed by LSD pioneers. How was this compatible with the rigorously conceptual compositional structure of In C and the technological focus of the San Franscisco Tape Center where it was first performed? And what was the impact on compositional innovations of the SF Tape Center of the concerns of its members, particularly Pauline Oliveros, for Ramon Sender’s unexpected departure into the radical outer fields of LSD experimentation and commune life? The splintering of tendencies in popular music was in part accelerated by differences of opinion about drug use. Wallace Berman spoke about the stifling effects of heroin on creativity compared with the transformative motivations deriving from hallucinogens, yet his silent film Aleph depicts both drug uses, seemingly uncritically, while featuring imagery of Bob Dylan and The Rolling Stones, amongst other musical references. Frank Zappa’s derisory lyrics in ‘Plastic People’ referred to Andy Warhol’s Plastic Inevitable and the Velvet Underground’s proclivity for heroin, although like his sometime musical partner, Captain Beefheart, he was hardly any more tolerant of hallucinogen use. Is it possible to differentiate Zappa’s and Beefheart’s inventive and bizarre customizing of psychedelia in their approaches to music and visual design as a critical aesthetics set apart from their LSD enthusiast peers? Can a difference of aesthetics be discerned between such critical musical positions and the immersive, interminable drift <b>of</b> hallucinatory <b>music,</b> {{as well as the}} slump, cacophony and sonic darkness of narcotic-inspired songs, and, if so, what qualities are possessed by their respective imagery archives...|$|R
