Agagianian <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> these four from the Curia, and represented the Eastern Catholic Churches.

5|$|Christopher Eccleston <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> {{the four}} lead actors {{who was already}} an {{established}} television face, having previously co-starred in the ITV crime drama series Cracker. Eccleston first heard about the project while working with Danny Boyle on the film Shallow Grave {{in the autumn of}} 1993. Initially, Eccleston had been considered by the production team as a candidate to play Geordie, but he was more interested in playing Nicky, who he saw as a more emotionally complex character. Eccleston was particularly concerned about being able to successfully perform with the Newcastle Geordie accent. He did not even attempt the accent at his audition, concentrating instead on characterisation. He drew inspiration for his performance as the older Nicky from Peter Flannery himself, basing aspects of his characterisation on Flannery's personality. He even wore some of the writer's own colourful shirts.|$|E

An oblivious Steph did not realised that she is being stalked by serial killer, Toby Mills (Henry Luxemburg). It {{was part of a}} storyline that had been running in the background for while. He attacked her, and proceeds by stabbing her in the head and leaving her to die. Steph was then found unconscious and she woke up a week later in hospital where she was diagnosed with epilepsy.

5|$|Following the {{declaration}} of war on Henry by Prince Richard and King Philip II of France in 1187, Geoffrey was given command of {{a quarter of the}} English royal army. He and his father were driven from Le Mans, Henry's birthplace, in 1189. Geoffrey did not attend the subsequent conference at which Henry submitted to Philip immediately before Henry's death, unwilling to witness his father's humiliation, but he did help nurse him during his final days. Henry made a bedside wish that Geoffrey be made either Archbishop of York or Bishop of Winchester, and Geoffrey used his father's seal to make appointments to York after Henry's death. Geoffrey then escorted Henry's body to Fontevrault Abbey for burial. He <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Henry II's sons present at his death.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey (c.1152– 12 December 1212) was {{an illegitimate}} son of Henry II, King of England, who became bishop-elect of Lincoln and {{archbishop}} of York. The identity {{of his mother}} is uncertain, but {{she may have been}} named Ykenai. Geoffrey held several minor clerical offices before becoming Bishop of Lincoln in 1173, though he was not ordained as a priest until 1189. In 1173–1174, he led a campaign in northern England to help put down a rebellion by his legitimate half-brothers; this campaign led to the capture of William, King of Scots. By 1182, Pope Lucius III had ordered that Geoffrey either resign Lincoln or be consecrated as bishop; he chose to resign and became Chancellor instead.

5|$|Heliopolis <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Ganteaume's {{ships to}} reach the Egyptian garrison, joining the frigate Régénérée and the {{corvette}} Lodi that had each made the passage independently and had arrived on 1 March. It was the last reinforcement for the Army of Egypt: without Ganteaume's supplies and with the Royal Navy dominant in the Eastern Mediterranean, the French forces in Egypt were outnumbered by the British expeditionary force and defeated in a campaign {{during the summer of}} 1801, surrendering at the Capitulation of Alexandria in August. Although he totally failed to achieve his primary objective, Ganteaume's naval forces had significantly reinforced the battered French Mediterranean fleet: the ships that were detached at Elba in May were subsequently engaged at the Battles of Algeciras in July, at which another British ship of the line was captured but the Franco-Spanish force suffered severe losses.|$|E
5|$|In October 1946 David Lilienthal asked Bacher {{to become}} one of the inaugural commissioners of the United States Atomic Energy Commission, the {{civilian}} agency that was being formed to replace the wartime Manhattan Project. As a Republican, Bacher was easily confirmed by the Senate members of the United States Congress Joint Committee on Atomic Energy by an 8–0 vote. As he <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the five commissioners who was a scientist—an important factor in his decision to accept the post—he played a leading role in the selection of the Atomic Energy Commission's influential General Advisory Committee to which nine scientists were appointed: James Conant, Lee DuBridge, Enrico Fermi, Robert Oppenheimer, Isidor Isaac Rabi, Hartley Rowe, Glenn Seaborg, Cyril Smith and Hood Worthington.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1930s, {{after the}} {{transfer}} of the Ukrainian capital from Kharkov to Kiev, a decision was made to demolish the cathedral and build administrative buildings in its place. For this purpose, in 1934 soviet authorities have decided to hold a competition for the project of the Governmental Center with a place for parades. In all of the projects submitted for the location in the area of Bogdan Khmelnitsky Square, the St. Michael's Golden-domed Cathedral was demolished, except for one. The project of Joseph Karakis <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> four projects submitted for the competition with the location of the center in this place, in which the St. Michael's Golden-domed Cathedral and the monument to Bogdan Khmelnitsky were preserved.

5|$|Over Ross's protests, {{the men of}} the Sixth Regiment {{elected him}} colonel in 1862. He did not want the {{responsibility}} of the position and had not wanted to embarrass a friend who wanted the job. Their brigade commander, General Charles W.

For the return match on 15 September, the younger Verge was brought in at five-eighth, which helped strengthen the team. No points were scored in the first half, although the visitors came close to getting a try but were held up on the line. In the second half, Otago scored six points to Sydney's three, and again came away the winners. Verge missed scoring from a penalty kick, which hit the crossbar.|$|E

5|$|The first sixteen {{issues of}} Unknown had cover paintings, but from July 1940 the cover style {{was changed to}} a table of contents, with a small ink drawing usually {{accompanying}} the summary of each story, {{in an attempt to}} make the magazine appear more dignified. The cover art came almost entirely from artists who did not contribute to many science fiction or fantasy magazines: six of the sixteen paintings were by H. W. Scott; Manuel Islip, Modest Stein, Graves Gladney, and Edd Cartier provided the others. Cartier <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> these who regularly contributed to sf and fantasy periodicals; he painted four of Unknowns last six covers before the change to a text-heavy design.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{traveling}} without {{key players}} Marion Motley and Bill Willis because of Florida's segregation laws, Cleveland beat Miami in a shutout {{for the second}} time in the season, winning 34–0. Fueled by the ire the entire team felt because of leaving friends behind, Otto Graham opened the scoring with a 37-yard interception return for a touchdown and the Browns never looked back. Three other Browns players – Edgar Jones, Gaylon Smith and Gene Fekete – ran for touchdowns. Fekete's touchdown <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his short professional career. Groza kicked two field goals, giving him 12 on the season and tying the all-time professional record set in 1926 by Paddy Driscoll. Cleveland led Miami in all phases of the game, amassing 159 yards rushing to Miami's eight and 233 yards of total offense. Miami gained a total of 46 yards rushing and passing. As the Browns prepared to face the Dodgers in the last game of the regular season, they looked ahead to a matchup in the AAFC championship in Cleveland on December 22 with the New York Yankees, the winners the eastern division.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{his absence}} from Constantinople {{at the time}} of Phocas's takeover, and because he {{retained}} a large measure of support within the soldiery, Priscus <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Maurice's senior generals who was retained by the new regime, whereas Comentiolus and Peter were executed and Philippicus was banished to a monastery. A possible explanation for this comes from the later historian Paul the Deacon, who records, possibly based on early 7th-century sources, that Phocas had once served as an equerry under Priscus. At any rate, Priscus was soon counted among the main supporters of the new regime. In the winter of 602/603, he was made comes excubitorum, commander of the imperial bodyguard. In 606 or 607, he also married Phocas's daughter, Domentzia, becoming the effective heir-apparent to the sonless ruler. In the games celebrated at the Hippodrome to honor the event, however, Phocas reacted violently when he saw portraits of Priscus and Domentzia carried alongside his by the citizens. From this moment on, the chroniclers report, Priscus turned against Phocas.|$|E
