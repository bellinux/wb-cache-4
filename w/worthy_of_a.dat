5|$|All {{activities}} {{were open to}} slaves {{with the exception of}} politics. For the Greeks, politics was the only activity <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> citizen, the rest being relegated wherever possible to non-citizens. It was status that was of importance, not activity.|$|E
5|$|Whatever {{the nature}} of the Ghoorkhas may have been found in other quarters, there was here no cruelty to wounded or to prisoners; no {{poisoned}} arrows were used; no wells or waters were poisoned; no rancorous spirit of revenge seemed to animate them: they fought us in fair conflict, like men; and, in intervals of actual combat, showed us a liberal courtesy <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> more enlightened people.|$|E
5|$|At the NFL Combine, Cody {{weighed in}} at , {{making him the}} {{heaviest}} combine participant since Aaron Gibson in 1999. He had managed to shed some weight since the Senior Bowl, but according to Mike Mayock he was still not <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> first-round pick. Cody ran a 5.62 sec 40-yard dash, the slowest by an eventually drafted defensive tackle since Corey Swinson, a seventh round pick in the 1995 NFL Draft. Cody was selected in the 2nd round (57th overall) by the Baltimore Ravens. He was the highest picked Alabama Crimson Tide defensive tackle since Cornelius Griffin was drafted 42nd overall by the New York Giants in the 2000 NFL Draft.|$|E

5|$|At the age {{of eight}} the younger Reginald began {{attending}} the local grammar school at Whitchurch, where he remained for five years. In 1796 {{he was sent to}} Bristow's, a small private school in Neasden a few miles north of Central London. This establishment provided intensive learning for around a dozen boys, preparing them for eventual entry to Oxford or Cambridge universities. At Bristow's Reginald met John Thornton, who became a lifelong friend. The pair shared a lively interest in church history and beliefs; a lengthy letter, written by Heber to Thornton, is described by Heber's biographer Arthur Montefiore as being <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> learned theologian. In October 1800 Heber entered Brasenose College, Oxford; Thornton's decision to go to Cambridge was a matter for Heber's considerable regret.|$|E
5|$|The First Test was a {{continuation}} of the trend of English batsmen being largely unable to cope with Australia's pacemen. Hutton was the only Englishman to pass 50 in the MCC match, and at Trent Bridge only he and Compton managed this feat. Apart from Hardstaff, none of the remaining batsmen passed 25. Wisden's verdict was that England fought back very well, but that avoiding defeat was almost impossible after their poor batting on the first day. Bowes considered the defensive English bowling display <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> draw, and blamed the first innings batting for the failure to prevenet defeat. However, he believed the English tactics to be justified and should have been continued.|$|E
5|$|The {{children}} of both {{government and private}} slaves were born slaves. Government slaves could be granted freedom by the emperor if they were deemed too elderly, if the emperor pitied them, or if they committed a meritous act <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> manumission. In one exceptional case, the former slave Jin Midi (d. 86 BCE) {{became one of the}} regents over the government. Private slaves could buy their freedom from their master, while some masters chose to free their slaves. Although slaves were subject to beatings if they did not obey their masters, it was against the law to murder a slave; kings were stripped of their kingdoms after it was found that they had murdered slaves, while Wang Mang even forced one of his sons to commit suicide for murdering a slave. An edict of 35 CE repealed the death penalty for any slave who killed a commoner.|$|E

5|$|Punk {{was traded}} {{back to the}} Raw brand on October 11, 2010, after being swapped with Edge. He {{took part in the}} interbrand tag team match at Bragging Rights after {{injuring}} Evan Bourne to win a place, but the team lost. It was reported later that he was suffering with a hip injury that would stop him from competing. To keep a presence on television, he began commentating on Raw from November 22, having already commentated one NXT. During his commentary, he criticized John Cena for his actions against The Nexus. Sometimes he favored heel wrestlers over face wrestlers. At the end of December, Punk left the commentary team after assaulting John Cena on Raw and SmackDown with a chair. Punk later revealed that his motives for the attacks were that he had joined and assumed control of The Nexus. Punk then made each member of the group prove themselves <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> spot, with some choosing to join The Corre, which had been started by former Nexus leader Wade Barrett on SmackDown, instead.|$|E
5|$|The Actor's Children was {{released}} with enthusiasm and positive reviews in trade publications. The Moving Picture World reviews would be favorable and without much criticism, even calling the acting convincing. A more honest review in The New York Dramatic Mirror {{was written by}} a reviewer who {{was pleased with the}} production, but offered criticism about the production's weaker aspects. The reviewer found there to be too much emphasis on the unimportant parts and a lack of emotion from the actors, and the child actors performance was faulted by repeatedly looking at the camera. Critical reception of the film may not have been entirely neutral for a number of reasons. Edwin Thanhouser was a well-liked gentleman who had many friends in the Patents Company that likely wanted him to succeed. Furthermore, writers in the magazines hoped that Independents would succeed and challenge the Patents Company's stranglehold on the industry. Also, film critics and reviewers of the era would balance the negativity of even the worst films with some favorable aspects. Even without any ulterior motives, the film may have been <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> favorable review.|$|E

25|$|A direct free kick can {{be awarded}} to the {{opposing}} team if a player succeeds or attempts to kick or trip an opponent, jumps, charges or pushes an opponent, or strikes or attempts to strike an opponent. Holding, touching or spitting at an opponent are offenses that are <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> direct free kick, as are sliding in to play the ball while an opponent is playing it or carrying, striking or throwing the ball (except the goalkeeper). These are all accumulated fouls. The direct free kick is taken where the infringement occurred, unless it is {{awarded to the}} defending team in their penalty area, {{in which case the}} free kick may be taken from anywhere inside the penalty area. A penalty kick is awarded if a player commits one of the fouls that are <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> direct free kick inside their own penalty area. The position of the ball does not matter {{as long as it is}} in play but for a penalty kick, the ball must be on the outer line, perpendicular to the center of the net.|$|E

25|$|That {{the time}} of the {{cleansing}} of the sanctuary, synchronizing with the period of the proclamation of the message of Revelation 14, is a time of investigative judgment, first, with reference to the dead, and second, with reference to the living.

25|$|Every death {{sentence}} involves first an eligibility determination {{and then a}} selection of an eligible defendant {{for the death penalty}}. A defendant is eligible for the death penalty once the jury has concluded that {{he is a member of}} that narrow class of criminal defendants who have committed the most morally outrageous of crimes. An eligible defendant is then selected for the death penalty after the sentencer takes into account mitigating evidence about the character and record of the defendant in order to decide whether that individual is <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{death sentence}}.|$|E
25|$|Lindros {{never again}} wore a Flyers uniform, {{as he sat}} out the season {{awaiting}} a trade. Craig Ramsay retained the head coaching position as Neilson was not asked to return, which became {{a matter of some}} controversy. Ramsay lasted only until December when he was replaced by former Flyer great Bill Barber. Brian Boucher, who as a rookie backstopped the Flyers' playoff run the previous season, could not duplicate his performance in 2000–01 and lost the starting goaltending job to Roman Cechmanek, a former star in the Czech Republic. The performance of Cechmanek, <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Vezina nomination, helped the Flyers stay afloat, but they lost in the first round to Buffalo in six games.|$|E
