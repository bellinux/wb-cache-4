5|$|In chapter 157 of Njáls saga, a {{man named}} Dörruð {{witnesses}} 12 people riding together to a stone hut on Good Friday in Caithness. The 12 go into the hut and Dörruð can no longer see them. Dörruð goes to the hut, and looks through a chink in the wall. He sees that there are women within, {{and that they have}} set up a particular loom; the heads of men are the weights, the entrails of men are the <b>warp</b> <b>and</b> <b>weft,</b> a sword is the shuttle, and the reels are composed of arrows. The women sing a song called Darraðarljóð, which Dörruð memorizes.|$|E
5|$|A Turkish kilim is a flat-woven rug from Anatolia. Although {{the name}} kilim is {{sometimes}} used loosely in the West {{to include all}} type of rug such as cicim, palaz, soumak and zili, in fact any type other than pile carpets, the name kilim properly denotes a specific weaving technique. Cicim, palaz, soumak and zili are made using three groups of threads, namely longitudinal warps, crossing wefts, and wrapping coloured threads. The wrapping threads give these rugs additional thickness and strength. Kilim in contrast are woven flat, using only <b>warp</b> <b>and</b> <b>weft</b> threads. Kilim patterns are created by winding the weft threads, which are coloured, backwards and forwards around pairs of warp threads, leaving the resulting weave completely flat. Kilim are therefore called flatweave or flatware rugs.|$|E
25|$|Ends and Picks: Picks {{refer to}} the weft, ends {{refer to the}} warp. The {{coarseness}} of the cloth can be expressed {{as the number of}} picks and ends per quarter inch square, or per inch square. Ends is always written first. For example: Heavy domestics are made from coarse yarns, such as 10's to 14's <b>warp</b> <b>and</b> <b>weft,</b> and about 48 ends and 52 picks.|$|E
25|$|Since the mid-twentieth century, {{commercial}} production {{started in the}} villages of Abadeh and Yalameh. Abadeh rugs adopted traditional Qashqai designs, but used cotton for <b>warps</b> <b>and</b> <b>wefts,</b> the latter often dyed in blue. Yalameh carpets more resemble Khamseh designs with hooked medaillons arranged in the field. <b>Warps</b> <b>and</b> <b>wefts</b> were often in white.|$|R

25|$|Cotton {{forms the}} {{foundation}} of <b>warps</b> <b>and</b> <b>wefts</b> {{of the majority of}} modern rugs. Nomads who cannot afford to buy cotton on the market use wool for <b>warps</b> <b>and</b> <b>wefts,</b> which are also traditionally made of wool in areas where cotton was not a local product. Cotton can be spun more tightly than wool, and tolerates more tension, which makes cotton a superior material for {{the foundation of}} a rug. Especially larger carpets are more likely to lie flat on the floor, whereas wool tends to shrink unevenly, and carpets with a woolen foundation may buckle when wet. Chemically treated (mercerised) cotton has been used in rugs as a silk substitute since the late nineteenth century.|$|R
25|$|Knitting by {{machine is}} done in two {{different}} ways; <b>warp</b> <b>and</b> <b>weft.</b> Weft knitting (as seen in the pictures) is similar in method to hand knitting with stitches all connected to each other horizontally. Various weft machines can be configured to produce textiles from a single spool of yarn or multiple spools {{depending on the size}} of the machine cylinder (where the needles are bedded). In a warp knit there are many pieces of yarn and there are vertical chains, zigzagged together by crossing the Cotton yarn.|$|E
25|$|More {{expensive}} saris had elaborate geometric, floral, or figurative ornaments or brocades {{created on}} the loom, {{as part of}} the fabric. Sometimes <b>warp</b> <b>and</b> <b>weft</b> threads were tie-dyed and then woven, creating ikat patterns. Sometimes threads of different colours were woven into the base fabric in patterns; an ornamented border, an elaborate pallu, and often, small repeated accents in the cloth itself. These accents are called buttis or bhuttis (spellings vary). For fancy saris, these patterns could be woven with gold or silver thread, which is called zari work.|$|E
25|$|These {{included}} {{an article by}} American chemist Raymond Rogers, who conducted chemical analysis for the Shroud of Turin Research Project and {{who was involved in}} work with the Shroud since the STURP project began in 1978. Rogers took 32 documented adhesive-tape samples from all areas of the shroud and associated textiles during the STURP process in 1978. He received 14 yarn segments from Prof. Luigi Gonella (Department of Physics, TurinPolytechnic University) on 14 October 1979, which Gonellla told him were from the Raes sample. On 12 December 2003, Rogers received samples of both <b>warp</b> <b>and</b> <b>weft</b> threads that Prof. Luigi Gonella claimed to have taken from the radiocarbon sample before it was distributed for dating. The actual provenance of these threads is uncertain, as Gonella was not authorized to take or retain genuine shroud material, but Gonella told Rogers that he excised the threads {{from the center of the}} radiocarbon sample.|$|E
50|$|Double-cloth coverlets were double-woven, {{with two}} sets of {{interconnected}} <b>warps</b> <b>and</b> <b>wefts,</b> requiring the more elaborate looms of professional weavers. Wool for these coverlets was spun (and often dyed) at home and then delivered to a local weaver who made up the coverlet.|$|R
50|$|DOBAG Carpets are woven with Turkish knots. <b>Warps</b> <b>and</b> <b>wefts</b> {{are made}} of sheep wool, the pile {{consists}} of handspun wool, dyed locally with natural dyes prepared according to the recipes as experimentally re-established. No chemical treatment is applied after the carpet has been finished.|$|R
50|$|Pile {{rugs and}} flat weaves were {{essential}} items in all rural households and nomadic tents. They {{were part of}} a tradition that was at times influenced, but essentially distinct from the invented designs of the workshop production. Frequently, mosques had acquired rural carpets as charitable gifts, which provided material for studies. Rural carpets rarely include cotton for <b>warps</b> <b>and</b> <b>wefts,</b> <b>and</b> almost never silk, as these materials had to be purchased on the market.|$|R
500|$|Book Five, <b>Warp</b> <b>and</b> <b>Weft,</b> {{describes}} how a former Samurai, fleeing from Japan (which was conquered by China {{along with most}} of the rest of East Asia) to the New World, travels all the way across the continent to meet the Iroquois people. They name him [...] "From West" [...] and make him a chief of their confederacy. He helps organize their society into a larger defensive alliance of all the North American tribes (the Hodenosaunee League) and shows them how to make their own guns with which to resist the Chinese coming from the West and the Muslims coming from the East.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} widespread acclaim {{from television}} critics. Daniel Martin, writing for The Guardian called it [...] "an astonishing achievement" [...] and [...] "absolutely bloody terrifying". He praised the way Moffat handled River Song's story, {{as well as}} for making it an [...] "intricate romp jammed with ideas that make a truly cinematic piece of drama". Gavin Fuller's review for The Daily Telegraph praised the suspense and [...] "the revelation that all the statues were Angels" [...] which he called [...] "genuinely shocking". Though he commented it [...] "took a while to get going", once it did he thought it had turned into the [...] "first genuine chiller" [...] of the series. He wrote that the [...] "only real disappointment" [...] was the [...] "inference that the TARDIS doesn't really have to make its celebrated 'vworp, vworp' noise on landing", asking [...] "How can you do that to us long-time fans, Steven Moffat– that sound is part of the <b>warp</b> <b>and</b> <b>weft</b> of the programme!".|$|E

2500|$|Ian Hislop {{comments}} that {{history has been}} somewhat unkind to [...] "Britain's most hated civil servant", by forgetting that he proposed a much better bus service that ministers never delivered, and {{that in some ways}} he was used to do their [...] "dirty work for them". Hislop describes Beeching as [...] "a technocrat [...] wasn't open to argument to romantic notions of rural England or the <b>warp</b> <b>and</b> <b>weft</b> of the train in our national identity. He didn't buy any of that. He went for a straightforward profit and loss approach and some claim we are still reeling from that today". Beeching was unrepentant about his role in the closures: [...] "I suppose I'll always be looked upon as the axe man, but it was surgery, not mad chopping".|$|E
2500|$|The {{beginning}} of carpet weaving remains unknown, as carpets {{are subject to}} use, deterioration, and destruction by insects and rodents. Woven rugs probably developed from earlier floor coverings, made of felt, or a technique known as [...] "flat weaving". Flat-woven rugs are made by tightly interweaving the <b>warp</b> <b>and</b> <b>weft</b> strands of the weave to produce a flat surface with no pile. The technique of weaving carpets further developed into a technique known as loop weaving. Loop weaving is done by pulling the weft strings over a gauge rod, creating loops of thread facing the weaver. The rod is then either removed, leaving the loops closed, or the loops are cut over the protecting rod, resulting in a rug very similar to a genuine pile rug. Hand-woven pile rugs are produced by knotting strings of thread individually into the warps, cutting the thread after each single knot.|$|E
60|$|In saner hours far {{different}} are {{the amounts of}} these things from what, at first sight, they appear. Though it is no doubt important who is elected governor, mayor, or legislator, (and full of dismay when incompetent or vile ones get elected, as they sometimes do,) there are other, quieter contingencies, infinitely more important. Shams, &c., {{will always be the}} show, like ocean's scum; enough, if waters deep and clear make up the rest. Enough, that while the piled embroider'd shoddy gaud and fraud spreads to the superficial eye, the hidden <b>warp</b> <b>and</b> <b>weft</b> are genuine, and will wear forever. Enough, in short, that the race, the land which could raise such as the late rebellion, could also put it down. The average man of a land at last only is important. He, in these States, remains immortal owner and boss, deriving good uses, somehow, out of any sort of servant in office, even the basest; (certain universal requisites, and their settled regularity and protection, being first secured,) a nation like ours, in a sort of geological formation state, trying continually new experiments, choosing new delegations, is not served by the best men only, but sometimes more by those that provoke it--by the combats they arouse. Thus national rage, fury, discussions, &c., better than content. Thus, also, the warning signals, invaluable for after times.|$|E
50|$|Officers' coats {{were made}} from superfine broadcloth; {{manufactured}} from much finer imported Spanish wool, spun finer <b>and</b> with more <b>warps</b> <b>and</b> <b>wefts</b> per inch. The result was a slightly lighter cloth than that used for privates, still essentially a broadcloth and maintaining the characteristics of that cloth, but slightly lighter and with a much finer quality finish.|$|R
5000|$|In {{contemporary}} textile manufacturing, {{the term}} [...] "double cloth" [...] or [...] "true double cloth" [...] is sometimes restricted to fabrics with two <b>warps</b> <b>and</b> three <b>wefts,</b> made up as two distinct fabrics lightly connected {{by the third}} or binding weft, but this distinction is not always made, and double-woven fabrics in which two <b>warps</b> <b>and</b> two <b>wefts</b> interlace to form geometric patterns are also called double cloths.|$|R
50|$|Cotton is used {{primarily}} in the foundation, the <b>warps</b> <b>and</b> <b>wefts</b> of rugs. Cotton is stronger than wool, and, when used for the foundation, makes a carpet lie flat on the ground, as {{it is not as}} easily distorted as woolen strings. Some weavers such as Turkomans also use cotton for weaving small white details into the rug in order to create contrast.|$|R
50|$|It is made {{in several}} qualities, from line <b>warp</b> <b>and</b> <b>weft</b> to two <b>warp</b> <b>and</b> <b>weft,</b> and is used chiefly for aprons, pocketing, soldiers' gaiters, linings and overalls. The finer makes are {{sometimes}} made into shirts for workmen, and occasionally used for heavy pillow-cases.|$|E
5000|$|Double ikat {{is created}} by resist-dyeing both the <b>warp</b> <b>and</b> <b>weft</b> prior to weaving.

If they do not, the result {{is referred to as}} compound ikat.|$|E

500|$|Morris's {{patterns}} for woven textiles, {{some of which}} were also machine made under ordinary commercial conditions, included intricate double-woven furnishing fabrics in which two sets of <b>warps</b> <b>and</b> <b>wefts</b> are interlinked to create complex gradations of colour and texture. Morris long dreamed of weaving tapestries in the medieval manner, which he called [...] "the noblest of the weaving arts." [...] In September 1879 he finished his first solo effort, a small piece called [...] "Cabbage and Vine".|$|R
50|$|The velour {{widely used}} in the {{manufacture}} of theater drapes and stage curtains is manufactured using the same weaving process as velvet: two sets of <b>warps</b> <b>and</b> <b>wefts</b> woven at the same time, with additional threads that will become the nap in between, then cut apart to produce the two separate tufted fabrics. Cotton velours used for this range from 16oz per linear yard to 32oz per linear yard, synthetic versions typically run 13oz to 32oz per linear yard.|$|R
