5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} text's from the school's Louguan period is called the Xishengjing (The Scripture of Western Ascension). This text describes Laozi's emigration to India and the transmission of the Daode Jing to Yin Xi. However, the text is not really a narrative, but uses the stories as a framework to describe how an adept should live his life. The text describes how an adept can make use of the Dao that is inherent in the world, outlines meditation techniques, and discusses the results of living a sagely life and <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>after</b> death.|$|E

25|$|There {{are four}} theoretic {{paradigms}} of cognitive dissonance, the mental stress people suffer {{when exposed to}} contradictory information that is inconsistent with their prior beliefs, ideals, and values; (i) Belief Disconfirmation, (ii) Induced Compliance, (iii) Free Choice, and (iv) Effort Justification; which respectively explain: <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>after</b> a person acts inconsistently, relative {{to his or her}} prior intellectual perspectives; <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>after</b> a person makes decisions; and what are the effects upon a person who has expended much effort to achieve a goal. Common to each paradigm of cognitive-dissonance theory is the tenet: People invested to a given perspective shall—when confronted with disconfirming evidence—expend great effort to justify retaining the challenged perspective.|$|E

25|$|Broadly speaking, cask ale brewing {{starts the}} same as that of keg beer. The same brew run could be used to make cask, keg, and bottled beer. The {{difference}} is <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>after</b> the primary fermentation is finished and the beer has been left to condition. Typically keg and bottled beers are either sterile-filtered or pasteurised or both, but beer destined for cask is simply 'racked' (poured) into the cask in its natural state. Finings are usually placed in the cask to assist 'dropping' the yeast giving a clear beer. Extra hops and priming sugar may also be added. The cask is sealed and sent off to the pub. In this state it is like a bottle-conditioned beer and, like bottle-conditioned beers, the beer will continue to develop for a certain period of time. Also like bottle-conditioned beers, the length of time the beer can last in the cask will depend on the nature of the beer itself: unopened, stronger beers can last for months; light, delicate beers need to be tapped and sold quickly. Stronger beers may also need longer to settle and mature. Some pubs have been known to keep very strong beers in a sealed cask for a year or more to allow them to fully develop.|$|E

Growing up, {{his parents}} {{took him to}} First Baptist Church in Longview, but Davis {{said it was not}} until after his {{difficult}} 2010 season that he [...] "finally grasped true faith", according to Joshua Cooley. Davis says, [...] "It's not about how hard you’re working to go against the grain. It's just about surrendering every day.

500|$|Safran {{called the}} second season more cohesive, {{mirroring}} the first season and [...] "... keep the two-storyline structure". In an interview, he confirmed that the structure would be [...] "a little bit of flash-forward, but the majority will be what I like to call the present". According to Safran, the producers aimed at a more-mature, darker second season which would be [...] "less confusing" [...] to viewers. Safran had plotted an upcoming plot point as the first season ended, which saw Alex clearing her name, getting fired by the FBI and receiving a job offer by the CIA director. He revealed that the season-two storyline would focus on the contrasting work ethics of the FBI and the CIA. Safran elaborated {{about the differences between}} the FBI and CIA, saying: [...] "We're very interested {{in the fact that the}} FBI's so much about being honest, truthful and living up to your badge. And the CIA is the opposite. You succeed if you can deceive. So it's going to be interesting to see. It's like a funhouse mirror of what we've seen". He announced that the series would switch to a single timeline after the fourteenth episode. Safran said that {{the second season}} always intended to adopt a single timeline after the resolved storyline and the aftermath of the hostage crisis, adding [...] "When we broke Season 2, we knew we were going to go to one timeline, because it’s about the [...] event, and then it’s about <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>after</b> the event. And you can’t flashback to the Farm after the crisis is over". He said that the change was also due to viewer complaints that the first season's dual timeline was confusing.|$|E

2500|$|CommonSenseMedia {{gave the}} show {{a rating of}} 3 stars out of 5, writing [...] "Despite the show's charms, it doesn't quite {{live up to the}} {{original}} film.

2500|$|As {{things stand}} now this brings {{the process to}} another impasse. To avoid it some {{definition}} of <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>after</b> a shelf agreement is needed. One possible idea by this essay is to agree ahead of time that following attainment of a final status agreement {{there will be a}} negotiated detailed and staged implementation agreement which would define a process which would allow the creation of a stable functional Palestinian state in stages and over time. In Aug 2013 an indication that such an idea can be acceptable to the Palestinians was given by Mahmud Abbas in a meeting with Meretz MK-s. [...] In the meeting Abbas stated [...] "that there cannot be an interim agreement but only a final status deal that can be implemented in stages".|$|E

And then it had to deal with figuring out what's next. <b>What</b> <b>happens</b> <b>after</b> triumph?" [...] Wonder Boys was filmed in Pittsburgh, including locations at Carnegie Mellon University, Chatham College, and Shady Side Academy. Other Pennsylvania locations included Beaver, Rochester, and Rostraver Township. Hanson felt that Pittsburgh was [...] "right, emotionally and thematically" [...] for the film. The city was experiencing a mild winter during the film's shoot and they had to use a lot of artificial snow.|$|E
2500|$|An {{attempt to}} change the rules was made by Condoleezza Rice and Tzipi Livni when they brought forth the concept of a shelf agreement. [...] The idea was to {{disengage}} the linkage between negotiations and actions on the ground. In theory this would allow negotiations until a [...] "shelf agreement" [...] defining peace would be obtained. Such an agreement would not entail implementation. It would just describe what peace is. It would stay on the shelf but eventually will guide the implementation. The difficulty with this notion is that it creates a dis-incentive for Israel to reach such an agreement. The lack of clarity about <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>after</b> agreement is reached will result in insurmountable pressures on Abbas to demand immediate implementation. However, from the Israeli point of view, the Palestinians are not ready to create a stable state, such an implementation process will almost guarantee instability in the Palestinian areas with a possible Hamas takeover as happened in Gaza.|$|E

2500|$|Many other reviews {{were also}} complimentary; in The New York Times Book Review (25 February 1940), Isaac Anderson {{detailed}} the set-up {{of the plot}} {{up to the point}} where [...] "the voice" [...] accuses the ten [...] "guests" [...] of their past crimes or sins, which have all resulted in the deaths of other human beings, and then said, [...] "When you read <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>after</b> that you will not believe it, but you will keep on reading, and as one incredible event is followed by another even more incredible you will still keep on reading. The whole thing is utterly impossible and utterly fascinating. It is the most baffling mystery that Agatha Christie has ever written, and if any other writer has ever surpassed it for sheer puzzlement the name escapes our memory. We are referring, of course, to mysteries that have logical explanations, as this one has. It is a tall story, to be sure, but it could have happened." ...|$|E

After the destruction of Primatech and Pinehearst, the rival company of Primatech, the heroes attempt to lead normal lives until Nathan initiates his plan to round up all people with abilities. Sylar kills Nathan in an intense duel. However, because Nathan is a prominent political player, Matt Parkman (Greg Grunberg), who has power over people's minds, is instructed to alter Sylar's mind so that he will believe that he is Nathan and take his place. This has a negative side effect causing Sylar's consciousness to become trapped in Matt Parkman's mind.|$|E
