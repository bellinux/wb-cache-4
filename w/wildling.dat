5|$|In 1998's A Clash of Kings, Mormont leads a {{party of}} Night's Watch rangers beyond the Wall to {{investigate}} the disappearance of Jon's uncle Benjen, assess {{the intentions of the}} <b>wildling</b> leader Mance Rayder and learn more of the threat posed by the Others. Jon is sent out with a scouting party led by Qhorin Halfhand. On the journey, Jon comes upon a <b>wildling</b> lookout and takes the warrior girl Ygritte captive; though told to kill her, Jon lets her escape. Jon and Qhorin are subsequently captured by the wildlings. Qhorin, who faces certain execution at Mance's hands, commands Jon to infiltrate the wildlings and learn their plans, at any cost. Jon pretends to disavow the Night's Watch, and the wildlings force him to fight Qhorin to the death to earn their trust. With Qhorin's silent consent, Jon kills him with the aid of Ghost.|$|E
5|$|The {{captured}} <b>wildling</b> Osha, now {{a servant}} of the Starks, is harassed by Theon Greyjoy, who warns {{her that if she}} had been arrested in his homeland the Iron Islands, she would have suffered a worse fate. As Maester Luwin tells Theon to leave her alone after witnessing Theon's sexual advance on her, he asks Osha why she and other wildlings are coming south from the Wall. She reveals they were fleeing from the White Walkers, who have apparently returned after millennia of slumber, and declares that every army in the Seven Kingdoms should be marching north to confront that threat.|$|E
5|$|This episode {{introduces}} {{several prominent}} characters, most notably Stannis Baratheon (Stephen Dillane), Ser Davos Seaworth (Liam Cunningham), and Melisandre (Carice van Houten). The {{three of them}} represent {{the head of an}} entirely new storyline that intertwines with other plotlines as the season progresses. Other recurring characters introduced in this episode are drunken knight Ser Dontos Hollard (Tony Way), the Starks' captive Alton Lannister (Karl Davies), Melisandre's opponent Maester Cressen (Oliver Ford Davies), Davos's son Matthos Seaworth (Kerr Logan), Night's Watch member Dolorous Edd (Ben Crompton), <b>Wildling</b> Craster (Robert Pugh), and his daughter and wife Gilly (Hannah Murray).|$|E
5|$|At dinner, Randyll insults Sam's bookishness, weight, {{and lack}} of {{fighting}} prowess. Gilly defends Sam, mentioning that Sam killed a Thenn and a White Walker. When Sam's brother Dickon insists that White Walkers don't exist, Gilly declares that she saw the act herself, but in doing so reveals her <b>Wildling</b> heritage. Disgusted, Randyll further insults Sam and Gilly, prompting Melessa and Talla {{to leave the room}} with Gilly in anger. Randyll tells Sam that Gilly and Little Sam can remain at Horn Hill, but that he must never set foot in Horn Hill again. Sam bids farewell to Gilly, but then changes his mind and decides to bring her and Little Sam with him to the Citadel. As they leave, Sam takes House Tarly's ancestral Valyrian steel sword, Heartsbane, as well.|$|E
5|$|The costumes used in {{the show}} drew {{inspiration}} {{from a number of}} sources, such as Japanese and Persian armour. Dothraki dress resembles that of the Bedouin (one was made out of fish skins to resemble dragon scales), and the Wildlings wear animal skins like the Inuit. <b>Wildling</b> bone armor is made from molds of actual bones, and is assembled with string and latex resembling catgut. Although the extras who play Wildlings and the Night's Watch often wear hats (normal in a cold climate), members of the principal cast usually do not so viewers can distinguish the main characters. Björk's Alexander McQueen high-neckline dresses inspired Margaery Tyrell's funnel-neck outfit, and prostitutes' dresses are designed for easy removal. All clothing used is aged for two weeks so it appears realistic on high-definition television.|$|E
25|$|Jon Snow and the <b>wildling</b> party led by Tormund Giantsbane {{continue}} their journey south. Ygritte stops with Jon {{to discuss their}} next move. Soon after, Orell offers some harsh wisdom to Jon, and later speaks to Ygritte, confessing his love for her and trying to convince her that Jon is still loyal to the Night's Watch. Later, Jon tells Ygritte that the <b>wildling</b> cause is hopeless, but she remains undaunted.|$|E
25|$|Beyond the Wall, Jon Snow joins Mance Rayder's <b>wildling</b> army, {{but with}} hidden intentions. His vows are tested {{more than ever}} by a growing romance with <b>wildling</b> Ygritte, as he finds {{that he will have}} to choose between her and the Night's Watch. The latter has been largely {{decimated}} by a White Walker attack, and a group of them is making their way back to the Wall. However, many of the rangers find themselves also questioning their vows, putting Lord Commander Mormont's and Samwell Tarly's lives in danger.|$|E
25|$|Jon convinces Mance {{that he is}} a deserter {{from the}} Night's Watch and learns that the Others are driving the wildlings south towards the Wall. Jon and his captor Ygritte also begin a sexual relationship. Mance seeks the legendary Horn of Winter to shatter the Wall. After {{climbing}} the Wall, the wildlings press Jon to murder a homeless man. When Jon refuses, the wildlings turn on him but Jon, with the assistance of Bran's direwolf Summer (Bran and company are hiding in a nearby abandoned tower), kills many of the wildlings and escapes to Castle Black. The approaching <b>wildling</b> army reaches Castle Black and assaults the Wall; but Jon takes command of the defenses and repels several assaults, during which Ygritte is slain. After that, Janos Slynt and Alliser Thorne imprison Jon for treachery and subsequently send him north of the Wall to kill Mance under a pretense of parley. As Jon is talking with Mance in the <b>wildling</b> camp, the army of King Stannis arrives, routing the Wildlings, and Mance is imprisoned. Melisandre believes the <b>wildling</b> invasion to portend the return of the Great Other, the sworn foe of her god R'hllor. Stannis offers to legitimize Jon and make him Lord of Winterfell in exchange for his support, but when his direwolf Ghost unexpectedly returns, Jon decides to decline Stannis' offer. Before he can inform Stannis, Jon is chosen by the Night's Watch as its new Lord Commander.|$|E
25|$|Whilst on a ranging {{beyond the}} Wall, Jon Snow captures a <b>Wildling,</b> Ygritte, who soon leads {{him into a}} trap where he himself is {{captured}} by Ygritte's fellow wildlings. Amongst the wildlings' prisoners is fellow ranger Qhorin Halfhand, who convinces Jon to kill him {{in order to gain}} the wildlings' trust so he can get close to their leader, King-beyond-the-Wall Mance Rayder. The rest of the rangers set up camp at an ancient fortification, the Fist of the First Men, where they come under attack from an ancient enemy, the White Walkers.|$|E
25|$|South of the Wall, Bran and {{his group}} take shelter in an {{abandoned}} mill. Nearby, Jon and the <b>wildling</b> party raid an elderly horse breeder's home, taking his horses and gold while the old man flees. While in the mill, Bran and Jojen Reed discuss how they plan to cross the Wall, before Meera spots the old horse breeder riding nearby. After the old man is captured by the wildlings, Hodor—scared by the thunder—begins yelling, which threatens to give away their location to the wildlings. Bran uses his warg abilities to enter Hodor's mind and knocks him out.|$|E
25|$|Paola Dionisotti and Rupert Vansittart {{were cast}} as Lady Anya Waynwood and Bronze Yohn Royce. They are {{the heads of}} House Waynwood and House Royce of Runestone: two {{powerful}} vassal houses of House Arryn. Yuri Kolokolnikov plays Styr: One of Mance Rayder's lieutenants and the Magnar – {{the name of the}} first ever Lord of Thenn which is now a title – of the Thenn people, a <b>wildling</b> clan. Two mysterious characters from Bran's storyline have also been cast: the Three-Eyed Crow, who is played by Struan Rodger, and a Child of the Forest, played by Octavia Alexandru.|$|E
25|$|The <b>wildling</b> army, led by Mance Rayder {{arrives at}} the Fist of the First Men to find a field of decapitated horses {{arranged}} in shape of a whirl by the White Walkers. Jon Snow notes {{that there are no}} dead Night's Watch brothers amongst the horses, which Orell claims he had seen. Rayder tells Jon that the dead have become wights, and orders Tormund Giantsbane to take 20 men, along with Jon, and climb the Wall. Rayder then says he will light the biggest fire the North has seen to signal them to attack the Night's Watch. He stipulates that if Snow doesn't prove useful, he can be thrown off the Wall.|$|E
25|$|The {{filming of}} the third season began in early July 2012, and {{concluded}} with the wrap of the unit filming in Iceland on November 24, 2012. Filming in Iceland, for scenes {{in five of the}} season's ten episodes, took place near Akureyri and Lake Mývatn. Dimmuborgir was used as the location for Mance Rayder's <b>wildling</b> army camp, and the Grjótagjá cave was used as establishing shot of Jon Snow and Ygrite in the cave although most of this scene was filmed in the studio. The filming in Iceland lasted eight days, as opposed to nearly a month for season 2. Kit Harington (Jon Snow) broke an ankle in an accident in July, which required the Iceland shoots to be pushed back to give him time to heal, as well as the occasional use of a body double.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "The Wars to Come", Stannis enlists Jon as an {{intermediary}} {{between himself and}} Mance, hoping to add the <b>wildling</b> army to his own. Mance refuses to submit to Stannis, and the <b>wildling</b> king is {{burned at the stake}} by the red priestess Melisandre. In [...] "The House of Black and White", Stannis offers to legitimize Jon and make him lord of Winterfell in exchange for his support. Jon is voted the new Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, initially tying with his nemesis Thorne but having the tie settled by Maester Aemon. Jon's intent to welcome the wildlings into Westeros and grant them lands by the Wall further enrages Thorne's faction of the Watch, who hold a deep seated hatred for the wildlings. In [...] "Hardhome", Jon travels by ship north of the Wall to the eponymous <b>wildling</b> village, seeking their support for his plan to ally the Night's Watch and the wildlings against the growing threat of the White Walkers. As some the <b>wildling</b> clans board Stannis' ships to travel south, a massive force of wights, led by White Walkers and their Night King, attacks the village. Jon kills a White Walker with Longclaw, learning that weapons forged with Valyrian steel can destroy them completely. Jon and his group barely make it out alive, with {{only a fraction of the}} <b>wildling</b> forces. Jon then permits the <b>wildling</b> forces to pass through the Wall into the North. Shortly after returning to Castle Black in the season finale [...] "Mother's Mercy", Jon is summoned to hear news of his missing uncle Benjen, but is instead stabbed to death by Thorne and his group of mutineers.|$|E
500|$|In season 2, Jon {{witnesses}} the <b>wildling</b> Craster, a {{man with}} many wives who marries his own daughters, sacrifice his newborn son to the White Walkers in [...] "The Night Lands". Later, {{as part of a}} small scouting party led by Night's Watch ranger Qhorin Halfhand, Jon is tasked to kill a <b>wildling</b> prisoner, the woman warrior Ygritte. He finds himself unable to do so in [...] "The Old Gods and the New", and she escapes, only to capture him with her comrades in [...] "The Prince of Winterfell". Qhorin orders Jon to pretend to defect and join the wildlings to discover their plans. In [...] "Valar Morghulis", Qhorin stages a fight and secretly instructs Jon to kill him to gain the wildlings' trust. Jon does, and is taken to meet Mance Rayder, the wildlings' King-Beyond-the Wall.|$|E
500|$|While Theon {{is trying}} to {{convince}} Robb to avenge his father for the Lannisters' attack, {{a small group of}} wildlings (humans who live north of the wall, outside of [...] "civilized" [...] lands), who have ventured south, capture Bran. Robb and Theon manage to kill all the men and capture the woman Osha. Despite Theon's help, Robb chastises him for endangering Bran's life when Theon shot an arrow at the <b>wildling</b> who was holding Bran.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{introduces}} the recurring {{character of the}} <b>wildling</b> Osha. The writer of the original books, George R. R. Martin, admitted that this casting was different from {{his vision of the}} character. As he explains, he was surprised to see that actress Natalia Tena was being considered for the role since Osha had been conceived as a hard-bitten older woman and the actress was [...] "too young and too hot." [...] However, when he saw the audition tapes he was convinced with the new approach: [...] "she was sensational, and I said, 'It's gotta be her.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Two Swords", Alliser Thorne and Janos Slynt {{call for}} Jon's {{execution}} for defecting to the wildlings, but Maester Aemon is convinced of Jon's {{loyalty to the}} Watch and sets him free. In [...] "First of His Name", Jon leads an expedition to Craster's Keep, where some men of the Watch have mutinied and murdered Lord Commander Mormont. After defeating the mutineers, Jon is reunited with Ghost. Tormund's wildlings attack Castle Black while Mance's army besieges the Wall in [...] "The Watchers on the Wall". The wildlings are successfully repelled, though Ygritte is shot and dies in Jon's arms. Before Jon can negotiate with or kill Mance, Stannis Baratheon's army arrives and routs the <b>wildling</b> camp, taking Mance prisoner in the season finale [...] "The Children".|$|E
500|$|Several {{reviews of}} 2011's A Dance with Dragons noted {{the return to}} the {{narrative}} of Jon, Daenerys Targaryen and Tyrion Lannister, the three popular characters whom fans had missed most from the previous volume, A Feast for Crows. These [...] "favorites" [...] had last been featured 11 years before in Martin's A Storm of Swords. In A Dance with Dragons, Jon's leadership of the Night's Watch is complicated by several unprecedented challenges, including a <b>wildling</b> alliance, the demands of would-be-king Stannis Baratheon and the conflicting factions developing within the Watch itself. The New York Times notes that [...] "Jon’s leadership is the best hope of Westeros, so naturally he’s in imminent danger throughout A Dance With Dragons." [...] James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly called Jon's final chapter in A Dance with Dragons [...] "a harsh chapter in terms of fan expectations. You go from this total high of Jon giving this rousing speech about going after the evil Ramsay Bolton, to this utter low of his men turning against him." [...] Jon's presence in the forthcoming volume The Winds of Winter is uncertain.|$|E
500|$|In {{regards to}} the White Walkers' origin, David Benioff stated [...] "No one's {{innocent}} really in this world, {{and there was just}} something really beautifully right about the idea that the great nemesis of mankind were created to protect the Children of the Forest from mankind." [...] D. B. Weiss noted, [...] "The Night King, who's sort of the embodiment of absolute evil, what you're watching is the creation of that absolute evil, so the absolute evil isn't absolute after all." [...] Benioff also alluded to the many references and foreshadowing throughout the series that preceded the reveal of the Children creating the White Walkers, saying, [...] "There are certain symbols and patterns that recur throughout the show. The first time we saw {{that was one of the}} very first scenes in the pilot, when Will the ranger sees the <b>Wildling</b> body parts in an odd pattern displayed by the White Walkers. We see it again north of the Wall with the dead horses displayed in a spiral pattern, and then you see it again here and see where these patterns come from, that they're ancient symbols of the Children of the Forest used in their rituals, and the Children of the Forest created the White Walkers." ...|$|E
500|$|Jon is {{introduced}} in 1996's A Game of Thrones as the illegitimate son of Ned Stark, the honorable lord of Winterfell, an ancient fortress in the North {{of the fictional}} continent of Westeros. Knowing his prospects are limited by his status, Jon joins the Night's Watch, who guard the far northern borders from [...] the wildlings who live beyond The Wall. As {{the rest of the}} Starks face grave adversity, Jon finds himself honor bound to remain with the Watch. In A Clash of Kings (1998), he joins a scouting party investigating the growing threat from the otherworldly [...] "Others" [...] beyond the Wall, and manages to infiltrate the wildlings. Jon learns of their plans to invade Westeros in A Storm of Swords (2000), and begins {{to fall in love with}} the fierce <b>wildling</b> woman Ygritte. He betrays them—and Ygritte—before they can attack, but the Night Watch's victory comes at a heavy price for Jon. Now the Lord Commander of the Watch, he appears briefly in 2005's A Feast for Crows. Jon returns as a prominent character in a A Dance with Dragons (2011), working to negotiate an alliance between the Night's Watch and the wildlings. The growing animosity he has attracted from among the Watch finally catches up with him, and he is forced to face the dire consequences.|$|E
2500|$|Jon Snow {{has ordered}} Samwell Tarly to sail to the Citadel in Oldtown (via Braavos), to {{research}} the Others and become a Maester. Sam is accompanied by aging Maester Aemon, the <b>wildling</b> mother Gilly, her newborn baby, and sworn brother Dareon. The voyage across the Narrow Sea is underway before Sam realizes Jon swapped the sons of Gilly and Mance Rayder, to protect the <b>Wildling</b> [...] "prince" [...] from sacrifice by the priestess Melisandre. Aemon becomes sick and the party wait in Braavos for his health to improve. After a Summer Islander tells Aemon about the Targaryen dragons, Aemon decides that Daenerys has come to fulfill a prophecy. He dies {{at the age of}} 102 shortly after they leave Braavos.|$|E
2500|$|Others {{were also}} {{added to the}} cast, either in a small {{recurring}} role or with reduced prominence. The most notable example is Tony Way's Ser Dontos Hollard, a drunkard knight, who had {{a pivotal role in}} Sansa Stark's storyline that ran in the course of two novels, while in the series the role was reduced to a small scene in the opening episode. Others include: Ben Crompton as [...] "Dolorous Edd" [...] Tollet, a man of the Night's Watch. Robert Pugh as the <b>Wildling</b> Craster, father and husband to Gilly. Kerr Logan as Davos Seaworth's pious son Matthos.|$|E
2500|$|Karl Davies as Ser Alton Lannister, a {{character}} {{created for the}} series who replaces Cleos Frey as envoy from the Starks to the Lannisters. Daniel Portman took the role of Podrick Payne, the squire to Tyrion Lannister. The 19-year-old Portman plays Podrick as about 16 years old, instead of about 12 as in the novels. To be able to portray Podrick as awkward, shy and weak, Portman, previously a sportsman, stopped his fitness regimen and gained some weight to appear more endearing. Lucian Msamati played Salladhor Saan, a Lysene pirate and friend of Davos Seaworth. Finally, Edward Dogliani appeared briefly as the [...] "Lord of Bones" [...] (or [...] "Rattleshirt" [...] in the novels), a <b>Wildling</b> leader and Oliver Ford Davies as Stannis's maester Cressen.|$|E
2500|$|Theon Greyjoy (Alfie Allen), a main {{cast member}} {{from the first}} season, but with lesser {{importance}} than the others, came to prominence during the second season, as his story unfolded and his character became more central. Gemma Whelan appeared as his sister, Yara Greyjoy. Named [...] "Asha" [...] in the novels, the character's name was changed to avoid confusion with the <b>Wildling</b> Osha, Bran Stark's companion. [...] "Asha" [...] is portrayed as a fairly provocative and independent woman, a captain of thirty ships, as opposed to her television counterpart Yara, who did not retain [...] "Asha's" [...] traits, although her rivalry with Theon remained intact. Their father Balon Greyjoy was played by Patrick Malahide. Many of the characters involved in the Greyjoys' storyline weren't introduced, most notably Balon's brother Aeron Greyjoy. Nonetheless, the storyline received enormous praise, with the alternation of Yara's name and persona being the only criticism.|$|E
50|$|Ygritte is a <b>wildling</b> woman {{known for}} her red hair. She is fierce and headstrong. In <b>wildling</b> culture she {{is known as a}} spearwife: a woman who is also a warrior.|$|E

50|$|A young <b>wildling</b> {{girl who}} lives {{north of the}} Wall, Gilly {{is one of many}} daughters of Craster, a <b>wildling</b> who takes all his daughters as wives once they grow up into women.
