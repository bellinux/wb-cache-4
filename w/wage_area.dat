40|$|This Paper {{provides}} an overview of the magnitude of sectoral wage differentials in the euro area as a whole. Even when adjusting for structural sectoral features such as the skill structure or the proportion of part-timers, average wage levels in services are substantially lower than in manufacturing. The paper also studies how the euro <b>area</b> <b>wage</b> structure compares with that of the United States and the United Kingdom. It discusses some possible determinants of intersectoral wage differentials in the euro area and their likely implications from a policy perspective. A number of worker characteristics (e. g. age, skills, the proportion of temporary or self-employed) are highly correlated with the structure of wage differentials. At the same time, wage differentials are also highly correlated with sector-specific features such as average firm size or capital intensity. Finally, the paper presents some stylised facts on how the euro <b>area</b> <b>wage</b> structure has evolved since the early 1980 s.

In a practical sense, {{there are differences in}} the local government occupations that are covered by each state branch. These differences arise out of the differing history of the predecessors of the ASU and whether there were other local government unions in existence at the time of ASU amalgamations.

40|$|L'auteur cherche à savoir pourquoi, malgré leur inefficacité reconnue, des lois du salaire minimum continuent à être adoptées par les législateurs. The basic {{teaching}} of economies on minimum wage laws is well-known: this legislation is inefficient because {{it results in}} non optimal combinations and locations of resources and therefore in lower total output and employment. What is less easily understood is why this policy is enacted {{in spite of its}} inefficiency. The answer offered in this note is that in addition to being inefficient, minimum wage legislations operate transfers of wealth from unorganized losers to well-organized gainers. Because of this advantage in the political market, the latter are found to dominate the political process. The victims of minimum wage laws belong to two broad categories of people. The direct and most immediate victims are the individuals who are disemployed {{as a result of the}} measure. These persons either become totally or partially unemployed or they choose to withdraw from the labour force in view of their deteriorated employment opportunities. In more concrete terms, the big losers are found in groups with lowest skills, namely 1. the young of both sexes 2. older workers deprived of an opportunity to make their contribution to family income 3. women of all ages and 4. low-wage workers in labour intensive industries located in declining regions. In a more general way, the society as a whole is made worse-off, because consumers have to pay higher prices for goods and services now produced in smaller quantities and taxpayers have to bear a heavier burden to finance unemployment and other social security measures. Representative governments do not enact laws that make only losers. Four groups of persons come out gainers from the adoption of minimum wage laws. First and fore-most, union workers rely on this policy instrument to counter the competition from lower skill non-union workers. Second workers in high <b>wage</b> <b>areas</b> support the policy because it lessens the tendency for manufacturing investments to locate outside their region. Third firms in high <b>wage</b> <b>areas</b> also join the supporters of this legislation in order to protect the value of their assets from potential competitors in low <b>wage</b> <b>areas.</b> Finally low <b>wage</b> workers who are able to retain their jobs are clearly made better-off. From empirical results in the U. S., where minimum wages are lower than in Canada, it would seem that the young lose more in reduced employment than they gain in in-creased wage rates. The effect would be about neutral among male adults. Only adult women would be net gainers. In the U. S., the position taken by the House Representatives on minimum wage rates was found to be consistent with theoretical predictions. Campaign contributions by unions, the level of wages in the district and the level of campaign contributions by small businesses were in that order the most important determinant of roll-call voting. Low-wage and teenage workers also influenced the voting pattern as expected. That gainers prevail over losers should not be surprising. Generally they are members of well organized pressure groups, for which the cost of lobbying and other forms of political action is almost nil. Opponents on the other hand include mostly isolated, ill-informed and unorganized individuals. In raising minimum wages, the governing party gain more votes among the beneficiaries than it looses among the victims...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{tests the}} “rising tide” and “trickle down” {{hypotheses}} of income growth by examining several measures of income inequality between 1983 and 1987. A {{close look at}} household incomes between those years shows that post-tax income growth has been concentrated among the 20 percent of American households with the highest incomes. The middle income classes have experienced only modest income growth over this period, and the 20 percent of American households with the lowest incomes have experienced a decline in income. These results hold whether the analysis {{is based on a}} summary measure of income equality such as the Gini coefficient, or on a less technical measure such as average income. Furthermore, income growth seems to be decreasing most rapidly for groups of households that historically have had the lowest incomes: female-headed households, blacks, and Hispanics. Finally, two standard explanations of the inequality trend-that the distributional changes are the result of either cohort effects or the movement of jobs to the lower <b>wage</b> <b>areas</b> of South-are tested by disaggregating the data. Neither hypothesis is confirmed by our research. ...|$|R
40|$|We analyze factors {{explaining}} the very different patterns of industrialization across the 42 counties of England between 1760 and 1830. Against the widespread view that high wages and cheap coal drove industrialization, {{we find that}} industrialization was restricted to low <b>wage</b> <b>areas,</b> while energy availability (coal or water) had little impact Instead we find that industrialization can largely be explained by two factors related to the human capability of the labour force. Instead of being composed of landless labourers, successful industrializers had large numbers of small farms, which are associated with better nutrition and height. Secondly, industrializing counties had a high density of population relative to agricultural land, indicating extensive rural industrial activity: counties that were already reliant on small scale industry, with the technical and entrepreneurial skills this generated, experienced the strongest industrial growth. Looking at 1830 s France {{we find that the}} strongest predictor of industrialization again is quality of workers shown by height of the population, although market access and availability of water power were also important...|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} decades, {{traditional}} manufacturing firms in Western economies have undergone a rapid transformation. Two {{effects of the}} globalised economy prompting firms to outsource labour intensive production to low <b>wage</b> <b>areas</b> are the increased market size and the competition. Innovation {{is a prerequisite for}} a successful transformation process and this paper analyses this process within four Danish lifestyle production industries: textile and clothing and wood product and furniture, which are being developed from being traditional production-oriented industries to becoming much more oriented towards knowledge intensive production in the form of design and marketing aspects. The analysis shows that the industries have experienced a decline in employment and a positive development in productivity while maintaining a significant contribution to export. A 2008 survey of Danish SMEs reveals that about two thirds of the firms carry out innovative activities. The decision to innovate is influenced by networking activities, access to financial resources, firm strategy, export orientation, growth potentials and age of the firm while a traditional characteristic like size does not influence the decision to innovate; innovation is a prerequisite for firm survival in the four industries...|$|R
40|$|This article {{establishes}} {{a link between}} the traditional labour economics and the urban economics literature by analyzing differences in working hours across regional labour market areas in the UK. Using a real wage index reflecting skill adjusted earnings net of quality adjusted house prices in Britain and panel data on working hours the effect of regional real wages on labour supply is assessed. The identification strategy relies on workers who move across 157 labour market areas in Britain and includes individual fixed effects. The main finding is that working hours are significantly higher in labour market areas that offer lower real wages. Decreasing real wages by £ 1000 results in an increase of working hours of 0. 3 %. Real wage differentials {{can be seen as a}} proxy for the local amenity level. I can replicate my finding including a set of amenities instead of the real wage index. The effect is mainly due to labour supply decisions of low skilled workers who work significantly longer hours in low real <b>wage</b> <b>areas</b> than high skilled workers. This indicates that low skilled workers are willing to increase their labour supply in order to afford living in high amenity areas...|$|R
30|$|Both the fixed-effects and first-differenced {{estimates}} suggest {{much larger}} wage effects for blacks than the decade-specific wage regressions discussed previously, although given their standard errors {{they are also}} consistent with the main regression results presented above. One explanation for this difference is that, because these models use the variation in changes in immigrant shares (rather than levels, as the decade-specific models use), they identify the effects of recent immigration, which may be larger if labor markets adapt to immigration over time, for example through endogenous adjustments to capital stock or industrial composition. However, the magnitudes of the point estimates may also indicate that the fixed-effects and first-differenced models are misspecified. As I show in Appendix 1, if wages follow a lagged dependent variable structure, estimates of a misspecified model that assumes a first-differenced/fixed-effects structure will be biased down. The intuition for this result {{is that if the}} initial wave of immigrants is attracted to high <b>wage</b> <b>areas,</b> future waves are attracted to areas with established enclaves, and wages are mean reverting, <b>areas</b> with declining <b>wages</b> will receive more immigrants, inducing a spurious correlation between changes in wages and changes in immigration. This possibility makes the lagged dependent variable estimates, which can be interpreted conservatively as upper bounds, preferable.|$|R

30|$|If {{factors of}} {{production}} are perfectly mobile, immigration will tend to exert no local effects—these effects would be entirely mediated through general equilibrium impacts on the larger market. This follows from trade theory; if economies are perfectly integrated, then local quantities are unrelated to local prices—the law of one world price for all factors will prevail. In other words, if one assumes that there is perfect factor price equalization (FPE) and no international factor price equalization, this means that immigration can affect aggregate wages but not relative <b>wages</b> across <b>areas</b> within a country.|$|R
