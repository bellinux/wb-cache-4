5|$|After {{scouring}} the Great Sea, Link learns {{that he must}} use maps and clues hidden in the Temple of the Ocean King to find the Spirits of Courage, Wisdom, and Power, which in turn will help him locate the Ghost Ship. With {{the help of the}} Phantom Hourglass, Link finds the Spirits of Wisdom and Power. When Link asks Oshus <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> Spirit of Courage, Oshus explains that it is in fact Ciela, after which she transforms into her true form. Now in possession of the three Spirits, Link, along with Ciela and Oshus, locate the Ghost Ship and find Tetra on board, who has been turned to stone. While Link determines how to save Tetra, Oshus reveals that he is the Ocean King and that he and Ciela had to change their appearances to hide from Bellum, a life-eating monster that Link must destroy to save Tetra. Oshus also mentions that Bellum was the one who created the Ghost Ship and turned Tetra into a statue, and that he has taken residence deep in the Temple of the Ocean King. Linebeck quickly readies to abandon their quest; outraged at the lack of treasure to be found. However, his loyalties instantly return when Oshus promises the captain one wish in return for his continued aid.|$|E

25|$|Papal {{attempts}} at codification of the scattered mass of canon law spanned the eight centuries since Gratian produced his Decretum c. 1150. In the 13th century especially canon law became {{the object of}} scientific study and different compilations {{were made by the}} Roman pontiffs. The most important of these were the five books of the Decretales Gregorii IX and the Liber Sextus of Boniface VIII. Legislation grew with time. Some of it became obsolete and contradictions crept in so that it became difficult in recent times to discover what was of obligation and <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> law on a particular question.|$|E

At the time of his arrest, police officers went to Weeks' house to search it. A neighbor told them <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> key. Officers entered the house of the defendant without a search warrant and took possession of papers and articles, which were turned over to the US Marshals. The officers returned later on the same day with the marshal, still without a warrant, and seized letters and envelopes that they found in the drawer of a chiffonier.|$|E
25|$|In The Restaurant at the End of the Universe (published in 1980), Zaphod is {{separated}} from the others and finds {{he is part of}} a conspiracy to uncover who really runs the Universe. Zaphod meets Zarniwoop, a conspirator and editor for The Guide, who knows <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> secret ruler. Zaphod becomes briefly reunited with the others for a trip to Milliways, the restaurant of the title. Zaphod and Ford decide to steal a ship from there, which {{turns out to be a}} stunt ship pre-programmed to plunge into a star as a special effect in a stage show. Unable to change course, the main characters get Marvin to run the teleporter they find in the ship, which is working other than having no automatic control (someone must remain behind to operate it), and Marvin seemingly sacrifices himself. Zaphod and Trillian discover that the Universe is in the safe hands of a simple man living on a remote planet in a wooden shack with his cat.|$|E

500|$|Although Alonso Álvarez de Pineda claimed Texas for Spain in 1519, {{the area}} was largely ignored by Spain until the late seventeenth century. In 1685, the Spanish learned that France had {{established}} a colony in the area between New Spain and Florida. Believing the French colony {{was a threat to}} Spanish mines and shipping routes, Spanish King Carlos II's Council of War recommended that [...] "Spain needed swift action 'to remove this thorn which has been thrust into the heart of America. The greater the delay the greater the difficulty of attainment.'" [...] Having no idea <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> French colony, the Spanish launched tenexpeditionsboth land and seaover the next threeyears. While unable to fulfill their original goal of locating the French settlement, the expeditions did provide Spain {{a deeper understanding of the}} geography of the Gulf Coast region. The last expedition, in 1689, discovered a French deserter living in southern Texas with the Coahuiltecans. In April 1689, the Frenchman helped guide the Spanish, under Alonso de León, to Fort Saint Louis, which had been destroyed by Karankawa Indians. De León's expedition also met representatives of the Caddo people, who lived between the Trinity and the Red Rivers. The Caddo expressed interest in learning about Christianity.|$|E
500|$|The modern {{search for}} the Mary Rose was {{initiated}} by the Southsea branch of the British Sub-Aqua Club in 1965 {{as part of a}} project to locate shipwrecks in the Solent. The project was under the leadership of historian, journalist and amateur diver Alexander McKee. Another group led by Lieutenant-Commander Alan Bax of the Royal Navy, sponsored by the Committee for Nautical Archaeology in London, also formed a search team. Initially the two teams had differing views on <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> wreck, but eventually joined forces. In February 1966 a chart from 1841 was found that marked the positions of the Mary Rose and several other wrecks. The charted position coincided with a trench (one of the scour pits) that had already been located by McKee's team, and a definite location was finally established at a position 3km (1.9mi) south of the entrance to Portsmouth Harbour (...) in water with a depth of [...] (36feet) at low tide. Diving on the site began in 1966 and a sonar scan by Harold Edgerton in 1967–68 revealed some type of buried feature. In 1970 a loose timber was located and on [...] 1971, the first structural details of the buried hull were identified after they were partially uncovered by winter storms.|$|E
500|$|The trust {{must then}} be {{formally}} constituted, by {{the transfer of}} its property to the trustees. For chattels, merely handing the property to the trustees is sufficient, assuming it comes with the relevant intention to create a trust. In some circumstances, providing the intention and telling the trustees <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> property is sufficient, as in Thomas v Times Books. Where the property is land or an equitable interest in land, it must be transferred by writing in accordance with Sections 52-3 of the Law of Property Act 1925. When dealing with shares, the transfer is not complete until a transfer document has been completed and the company has entered the change of ownership in its books. One of the equitable maxims is that [...] "equity will not assist a volunteer"; if someone {{does not have an}} interest in property, they cannot bring a court case. When trusts are not properly constituted, the trustees and beneficiaries have no equitable interest in the property, and so are volunteers. There are several exceptions to this maxim. The courts are willing to hear cases where the transfer was not completed, providing the intended beneficiaries or trustees have gained an interest through being made executor of the settlor's estate (the rule in Strong v Bird), or the gift was given donatio mortis causa, or where the settlor did all he could do, as in Re Rose, or where it would be [...] "unconscionable" [...] to hold the gift invalid, as in Pennington v Waine.|$|E

When Gabriel tries to inquire for more information, the Farseer shows surprise at his ignorance, commenting that the Inquisitor [...] "keeps them on a short leash". Macha implies that Toth knows more than he is telling, and advises Gabriel and Isador to ask him, before telling the Blood Ravens <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> entrenched Chaos forces, stating that, thanks to the Space Marines, the Eldar are too weak to confront them.|$|E
2500|$|By {{this time}} Sauron had regained {{much of his}} power, and the Dark Tower in Mordor had been rebuilt. Gollum, {{released}} from Mordor, was captured by Gandalf and Aragorn, and from him Gandalf learned that Sauron now knew <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> Ring. To prevent Sauron from reclaiming his Ring, Frodo and eight other companions set out from Rivendell for Mordor {{in an attempt to}} destroy the Ring in the fires of Mount Doom. During the quest, Frodo gradually became more and more susceptible to the Ring's power, and feared {{that it was going to}} corrupt him. When he and his faithful companion Samwise Gamgee discovered Gollum on their trail and [...] "tamed" [...] him into guiding them to Mordor, Frodo began to feel a strange bond with the wretched, treacherous creature, while Gollum warmed to Frodo's kindness and made at least some effort to keep his promise. Gollum eventually gave in to the Ring's temptation, however, and betrayed them to the spider Shelob. Believing Frodo to be dead, Sam bore the Ring himself for a short time and experienced the temptation it induced; he wore it briefly twice, but never succumbed to it.|$|E

2500|$|The next {{engagement}} involving Honningsvåg occurred {{four days}} later, on 19 May. The SS Albion, a 192-ton fishing trawler {{seized by the}} Germans at Trondheim, had landed 25 German soldiers at Rørvik on 18 May and continued northwards with a cargo of food and other supplies. The cargo {{was intended to be}} landed at Mosjøen or Mo i Rana, to supply troops of the German 2nd Mountain Division that were advancing northwards in the direction of Narvik. Albions mission came nine days after the Germans had successfully used the Norwegian Hurtigruten passenger-cargo vessel Nordnorge to land troops in Hemnesberget on 10 May and bypass strong Allied defensive lines in Nordland. Before Albion could reach her designation she was spotted by civilian observers on Mount Sundsfjellet in Vik, who reported her to Norwegian authorities. Honningsvåg and Heilhorn were ordered on 19 May by the commander at Bodø to intercept and sink the armed German-operated steamship. By the evening of 19 May the Norwegian warships found Albion riding at anchor at the Strømøyene islands some [...] north of Brønnøysund. Locals in rowing boats met the Norwegian warships and told them <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> Albion. After Honningsvåg had closed to less than , Heilhorn to even less of a distance, the Norwegians opened fire at around 2200hrs and sank Albion. The German crew jumped overboard, swam ashore, and were quickly captured by a waiting militia unit of volunteers from Brønnøysund and Velfjord. Of the ten Germans crewing the Albion two were killed and one wounded. The prisoners and the dead bodies were handed over to Honningsvåg for transportation to Sandnessjøen where they arrived {{in the early hours of}} 20 May. A Norwegian pilot was also rescued from the sunken ship. While the Norwegian pilot accompanied the warships back to Bodø, the German prisoners were handed over to a Royal Navy destroyer the Norwegian ships encountered off Sandnessjøen. The Albion was the last German blockade runner to attempt to break through the coastal areas under Norwegian control, with parts of the Helgeland coastline remaining unoccupied until early June.|$|E
