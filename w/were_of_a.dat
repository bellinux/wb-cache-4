5|$|Bajpayee won the Special Jury National Award for Pinjar (2003). This was {{followed}} by a series of brief, unnoticed roles in films that failed to propel his career forward. He then played a greedy politician in the political thriller Raajneeti (2010), which was well received. In 2012, Bajpayee essayed the role of Sardar Khan in Gangs of Wasseypur. His next roles <b>were</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> naxalite in Chakravyuh (2012), and a CBI officer in Special 26 (2013). In 2016, he portrayed professor Ramchandra Siras, in Hansal Mehta's biographical drama Aligarh, for which he won his third Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor.|$|E
5|$|Baron Edmond de Sélys Longchamps {{coined the}} name Raphus solitarius for these birds in 1848, as he {{believed}} the accounts referred to a species of dodo. When 17th-century paintings of white dodos were discovered by 19th-century naturalists, it was assumed they depicted these birds. Anthonie Cornelis Oudemans suggested that {{the discrepancy between the}} paintings and the old descriptions was that the paintings showed females, and that the species was therefore sexually dimorphic. Some authors also believed the birds described <b>were</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> species similar to the Rodrigues solitaire, as it was referred to by the same name, or even that there were white species of both dodo and solitaire on the island.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise {{was armed}} with two 100-pounder smoothbore, muzzle-loading Somerset cannon and two rifled 110-pounder breech-loading guns. The breech-loading guns <b>were</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new design from Armstrong and much was hoped for them. Firing tests {{carried out in}} September 1861 against an {{armoured}} target, however, proved that the 110-pounder was inferior to the 68-pounder smoothbore gun in armour penetration, and repeated incidents of breech explosions during the Battles for Shimonoseki and the Bombardment of Kagoshima in 1863–64 caused the navy to withdraw the guns from service shortly afterwards.|$|E

5|$|In November of that year, Prost had {{a meeting}} with the head of Honda's R {{department}} and F1 racing program, Nobuhiko Kawamoto in Geneva. He expressed his feelings that Honda was giving Senna preferential treatment, and Kawamoto then confirmed Prost's fears, explaining that the Honda engineers <b>were</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new generation, and that they liked Senna's panache and samurai-like driving. Kawamoto was able to convince Prost that he would work something out on the Honda end of the McLaren-Honda partnership for the 1989 season, but this was not to be.|$|E
5|$|On 22 January 1976, {{a second}} UDR soldier, Sergeant James Roderick Shane McDowell (aged 29, an optical worker, also from Lurgan) {{was arrested and}} charged with the Miami killings. He served in C Company, 11th Battalion UDR. The RUC were led to him through his glasses which had been found at the murder scene. Tests done on the glasses, which were {{eventually}} traced back to McDowell, revealed that the lenses <b>were</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> prescription worn by just 1 in 500,000 of the population.|$|E

5|$|Some of the Ticonderoga cannons, which <b>were</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{size and}} range not {{previously}} {{available to the}} Americans, were emplaced in fortifications around the city, and {{on the night of}} March 2, the Americans began to bombard the city with those cannon, to which the British responded with cannonades of their own. The American guns, under the direction of Colonel Knox, continued to exchange fire with the British until March 4. The exchange of fire did little damage to either side, although it did damage houses and kill some British soldiers in Boston.|$|E

The developments at Moatside Court and Bailey Court {{date from the}} 1960s and 1970s, whilst Owengate was formed {{from a series of}} old houses in the 1950s.

5|$|The genus {{attracted}} {{media attention}} in 2000, when a specimen unearthed in 1993 in South Dakota, United States, was interpreted as including a fossilized heart.

5|$|The osteoderms (scutes) {{covering}} {{the back of}} Deinosuchus were unusually large, heavy, and deeply pitted; some <b>were</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> roughly hemispherical shape. Deep pits and grooves on these osteoderms served as attachment points for connective tissue. Together, the osteoderms and connective tissue would have served as load-bearing reinforcement to support the massive body of Deinosuchus out of water. These deeply pitted osteoderms {{have been used to}} suggest that, despite its bulk, Deinosuchus could probably have walked on land much like modern-day crocodiles.|$|E

5|$|The second batch, {{known as}} RTL, <b>were</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> similar design but {{manufactured}} by Rohr Industries, an American company. These entered {{service on the}} Empire Corridor {{in the state of}} New York in 1976. The RTLs remained in service there through the 1990s, supplemented by several rebuilt RTGs. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, New York and Amtrak partnered to rebuild the RTLs for high-speed service; this project failed, and the last RTL trainsets left revenue service in 2003. After the settlement of legal issues, New York sold the remaining trainsets for scrap in 2012.|$|E
5|$|The {{techniques}} and technologies to deliver supplies by air {{were in their}} infancy. There were few aircraft available, and these <b>were</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> variety of different types, complicating maintenance. Air operations in New Guinea were restricted by the weather. Transport aircraft were vulnerable in the air, and required fighter escorts. They were also subject to destruction on the ground by Japanese air raids. The loss of the airstrip at Kokoda led {{to the adoption of}} air dropping. Due to a shortage of parachutes, supplies often had to be dropped without them, and loss due to breakages and unrecoverable goods was high.|$|E
5|$|When the British {{governor}} of Uganda, Sir Harry Johnston, discovered some pygmy {{inhabitants of the}} Congo being abducted by a showman for exhibition, he rescued them and promised to return them to their homes. The grateful pygmies fed Johnston's curiosity about the animal mentioned in Stanley's book. Johnston was puzzled by the okapi tracks the natives showed him; while he had expected {{to be on the}} trail of some sort of forest-dwelling horse, the tracks <b>were</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cloven-hoofed beast.|$|E

5|$|Wood {{observed}} that {{the requirements of the}} specification <b>were</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> multi-role nature, akin to the Hawker Siddeley P.1154 and variable geometry General Dynamics F-111K. In RAF service, the AFVG had originally been intended to serve as a fighter, replacing the English Electric Lightning in the interceptor mission. However, following the decision to procure the American-built McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II instead, the AFVG's expected role was changed in 1966 to supplementing the F-111K strike aircraft in replacing the English Electric Canberra and the V bomber force.|$|E
5|$|Aeronautical {{engineering}} {{firms were}} quick {{to respond to the}} Comet's commercial advantages and technical flaws alike; other aircraft manufacturers learned from, and profited by, the hard-earned lessons embodied by de Havilland's Comet. While the Comet's buried engines were used on some other early jet airliners, such as the Tupolev Tu-104, later aircraft, such as the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8, would differ by employing podded engines held on pylons beneath the wings. Boeing stated that podded engines were selected for their passenger airliners because buried engines carried a higher risk of catastrophic wing failure in the event of engine fire. In response to the Comet tragedies, manufacturers also developed various means of pressurisation testing, often {{going so far as to}} explore rapid depressurisation; subsequent fuselage skins <b>were</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> greater thickness than the skin of the Comet.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Orton, a butcher's son born on 20 March 1834 in Wapping, {{had gone}} to sea as a boy and had been in Chile in the early 1850s. Sometime in 1852 he arrived in Hobart, Tasmania, in the {{transport}} ship Middleton and later moved to mainland Australia. His employment by Foster at Gippsland terminated around 1857 with a dispute over wages. Thereafter he disappears; {{if he was not}} Castro, there is no further direct evidence of Orton's existence, although strenuous efforts were made to find him. The Claimant hinted that some of his activities with Orton <b>were</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> criminal nature and that to confound the authorities they had sometimes exchanged names. Most of Orton's family failed to recognise the Claimant as their long-lost kinsman, although it was later revealed that he had paid them money. However, a former sweetheart of Orton's, Mary Ann Loder, did identify the Claimant as Orton.|$|E
