500|$|At first, the {{producers}} {{were looking for}} a [...] "quintessentially American person" [...] {{to play the role of}} House. Bryan Singer in particular felt there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> was going to hire a non-American actor for the role. At the time of the casting session, actor Hugh Laurie was in Namibia filming the movie Flight of the Phoenix. He assembled an audition tape in a hotel bathroom, the only place with enough light, and apologized for its appearance (which Singer compared to a [...] "bin Laden video"). Laurie improvised, using an umbrella for a cane. Singer was very impressed by his performance and commented on how well the [...] "American actor" [...] was able to grasp the character. Singer was not aware that Laurie was English, due to his convincing American accent. Laurie credits the accent to [...] "a misspent youth [...] too much TV and too many movies". Although locally better-known actors such as Denis Leary, David Cross, Rob Morrow, and Patrick Dempsey were considered for the part, Shore, Jacobs, and Attanasio were as impressed as Singer and cast Laurie as House.|$|E

That the court system had arrested the wrong guy." [...] The juror denied this completely. Justice Williams ruled that she could remain on the jury since it had not been proven she made the statements.|$|E

2500|$|When John Kennedy {{was asked}} about the level of {{involvement}} and influence that his father had held in his razor-thin presidential victory over Richard Nixon, he would joke that on the eve before the election his father had asked him the exact number of votes he would need to win: there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> was paying [...] "for a landslide". Kennedy was one of four fathers (the other three being George Tryon Harding, Nathaniel Fillmore, and George Herbert Walker Bush) to live through the entire presidency of a son.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1951, the American diplomat Averell Harriman went to Iran to {{negotiate}} an Anglo-Iranian compromise, asking the Shah's help; his reply was that [...] "in {{the face of}} public opinion, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> could say a word against nationalisation". Harriman {{held a press conference}} in Tehran, calling for reason and enthusiasm in confronting the [...] "nationalisation crisis". As soon as he spoke, a journalist rose and shouted: [...] "We and the Iranian people all support Premier Mosaddegh and oil nationalisation!" [...] Everyone present began cheering and then marched out of the room; the abandoned Harriman shook his head in dismay.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the late}} 1950s, Carpenter {{decided that the}} Phillies needed a new home. [...] As {{mentioned}} above, {{he never wanted to}} buy Connie Mack Stadium in the first place, and was now convinced there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> could make money playing there. [...] The stadium didn't have nearly enough parking, and the neighborhood around it had already gone to seed. [...] To that end, he sold the park to Philadelphia Eagles owner Jerry Wolman in 1964, taking a million-dollar loss on his purchase of just 10 years earlier. [...] The Phillies remained at the old stadium until 1970. [...] In the last game played there, the Phillies avoided last place by beating the Expos 2–1.|$|E

Bob reveals that there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> himself could embark {{on such a}} relationship, as he might feel like a “child molester”. He {{has no intention of}} being insulting, and is in fact admiring Frank, but Frank’s facial expressions convey his own self-loathing.

2500|$|However, {{one week}} before {{recording}} was due to start, a dearth of material became apparent: [...] "I had four songs written, because {{that was all the}} lyrics I had from Graham. And I realized I wasn't getting any more words out of him. So I had to write a song a day so there was enough. Graham came with a couple of things, but there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> would come with enough songs to fill {{out the rest of the}} record. So I took an instant editorial decision that was what was going to happen. Some of those words stayed, and some of those words got worked on by Graham and me. That was it, basically." [...] The band worked on more than a dozen songs, dropping those that were not [...] "working quite well enough". Many of the songs were recorded in a single take, the band playing as a threesome: [...] "You have to understand, as a three-piece, we'd very rarely played together. [...] So [...] I thought, 'Let's see how it goes in the studio.' We worked with an engineer that we'd never worked with before, who was Irish. We did 'Moreover,' and after we were done playing, he came in and said, 'You make a big fookin' noise for three.'" [...] The band felt vindicated.|$|E
