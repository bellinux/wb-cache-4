25|$|In 1995 Lauro, doorman {{at a small}} Upper East Side {{apartment}} building, {{was arrested}} on burglary charges after a resident sent video from a hidden camera to police that apparently showed Lauro stealing from his apartment while on vacation. After his arrest the detectives were told he should be taken on a perp walk for cameras from a local TV station, to which the tenant had licensed his surveillance video. He was taken, in handcuffs, out to a police car, driven around the block and <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the building.|$|E
25|$|The logo {{starts the}} titles. During the {{animated}} titles, Dick and Dom are {{in bed and}} the hands from the logo wake them up, get out of bed, brush Dick and Dom's teeth, get their hair done, get them to the toilet and get them in the lift. At the beginning of every episode, after the titles had aired, a prerecorded segment was played in which the presenters emerged from the lift in the studio in a costume (e.g. Aeroplanes) whilst a song relating to the costume was played. Dick and Dom then <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the lift. The doors closed and the show then switched to live broadcast, with Dick and Dom reemerging from the lift in casual clothes and quickly starting the show.|$|E
25|$|It {{remains unclear}} whether {{the release of the}} 15 British naval {{personnel}} had any coincidence with the release of a senior Iranian diplomat, Jalal Sharafi, who was taken hostage during a kidnapping in 2007. He was released on Tuesday, 3 April 2007, and <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the Iranian embassy in Baghdad, although it is not clear who had abducted him. He was taken captive by a group of men dressed in uniforms of the Iraqi 36th Commando Battalion – a special Iraqi unit under US direction. After his release, Sharafi claimed he had been kidnapped and tortured by American troops and agents of an Iraqi organisation acting {{under the supervision of the}} US Central Intelligence Agency. Signs of torture were reportedly found on Sharafi's body for which he received medical treatment. Iran also allegedly now has access to five Iranian nationals arrested in the US raid on Iranian liaison office in Arbil. An International Committee of the Red Cross team also visited the Iranian detainees. The British government however repeatedly stated that it made no deals with the United States or with Iran to secure the release of the detainees, and the timing of these events may be purely coincidental.|$|E
2500|$|Before the {{congregation}} departs, the deacon <b>walks</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the sanctuary and says, [...] "Go in peace {{to love and}} serve the Lord" [...] (or similar words) as the people respond, [...] "Thanks be to God." ...|$|R

50|$|As Jackson stood there, the {{neighbor}} recalled that {{his face was}} “empty of any emotion or feeling or spark of life.” She watched him <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> his house, come back outside wearing different clothes, and driving away.|$|R
500|$|Boyle's {{memory was}} indeed excellent. On one {{occasion}} he illustrated both {{the accuracy of}} his memory and the audacity of his character {{at the expense of}} a brother member. Edmond Stanley, anxious to produce an effect in an important debate, had been at pains to reduce his speech to writing. Unluckily, Stanley happened to drop his manuscript in the coffee-room, and <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the House unconscious of his loss. Sir Boyle, finding the document, speedily mastered its contents, and, rising at the first opportunity, delivered the speech almost verbatim in the hearing of its dismayed and astonished author. His apology afterward only added insult to injury: ...|$|E
500|$|Although Sylvain said Rundgren {{was not an}} interfering producer, he {{occasionally}} involved himself to improve a take. Sylvain recalled moments when Rundgren went into the isolation booth with Nolan when he struggled keeping a beat and drummed out beats on a cowbell for him {{to use as a}} click track. During another session, he stopped a take {{and walked out of the}} control room to plug in Kane's bass cabinet. Scoppa, who paid afternoon visits to the studio, overheard Rundgren say, [...] "Yeah, that's all you needed. Okay, let's try it again!", and ultimately found the exchange funny and indicative of Rundgren's opinion of the band: [...] "Todd was such a 'musician' while they were just getting by on attitude and energy. But as disdainful as he appeared to be at some points he got the job done really well." [...] Rundgren felt Johansen's wild singing often sounded screamed or drunken but were eloquent in the sense that Johansen demonstrated a [...] "propensity to incorporate certain cultural references into the music", particularly on [...] "Personality Crisis". While recording the song, Johansen <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the control room and asked Rundgren if his vocals sounded [...] "ludicrous enough".|$|E
2500|$|On October 12, Valdez called Trinidad Espinoza to the stand. He {{testified that}} he saw Saldívar {{pointing}} a gun while running after Selena. Saldívar then stopped, lowered the gun, and <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> her motel room displaying no emotion. After hearing this testimony, Marcella Quintanilla (Selena's mother) experienced chest and arm pains and was hospitalized to treat a sudden rise in her blood pressure. Motel maid Norma Marie Martinez also described the same events as Espinoza, but added that Saldívar had called Selena a [...] "bitch". Tinker asked Martinez to indicate {{where she had been}} on a diagram of the scene of the crime. He believed that Martinez could not have seen or heard anything because she was a considerable distance from the vicinity of the shooting. Emergency room personnel, who attended to Saldívar when Selena drove her to the hospital to be checked for rape, claimed that Saldívar had lied to Selena about the rape as there were inconsistencies between the story she told them and the one she told Selena. Tinker asked the nurse to describe Saldívar's mood at that time. She replied that the Saldívar showed symptoms of depression. Tinker asked if those symptoms were typically found in a victim of sexual assault. The nurse agreed they were. Another nurse who attended to Saldívar stated that she had red welts on her neck and arms, but that they did not resemble the bruises a person would receive from an assault by a baseball bat as Saldívar claimed.|$|E

5000|$|Annada Shankar Ray's {{comment is}} suffice to {{indicate}} the importance of Char-Yari Katha in Bengali literature, [...] "The eternal aroma of a romantic mind {{is at the heart}} of Char-Yari Katha. It is at once pleasant and poignant. Another Char-Yari Katha cannot be had for the asking. One cannot just <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> youth and folly. Indeed, it is the swan song of second youth longing for the earlier one." [...] (Birbal, 1941) ...|$|R
