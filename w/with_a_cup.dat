5|$|Kerala cuisine has a {{multitude}} of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes prepared using fish, poultry, and meat. Culinary spices have been cultivated in Kerala for millennia and they are characteristic of its cuisine. Rice is a dominant staple that is eaten at all times of day. A majority of the breakfast foods in Kerala are made out of rice, {{in one form or}} the other (idli, puttu, appam, or idiyappam), tapioca preparations, or pulse-based vada. These may be accompanied by chutney, kadala, payasam, payar pappadam, appam, chicken curry, beef fry, egg masala and fish curry. Lunch dishes include rice and curry along with rasam, pulisherry and sambar. Sadhya is a vegetarian meal, which is served on a banana leaf and followed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> of payasam. Popular snacks include banana chips, yam crisps, tapioca chips, unniyappam and kuzhalappam. Seafood specialties include karimeen, prawns, shrimp and other crustacean dishes.|$|E
5|$|Nests {{built in}} the open are large and untidy domed structures, built of dry grass, twigs, and other plant {{material}}s. Any leaves or thorns present in a tree may be worked into the nest. In cavity nests, the hole is filled with a shapeless mass of grass <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> of soft material containing the eggs on the inside. When the disused domed nests of weavers are used, they are simply given a soft lining. The nest entrance is on the side, and is sometimes extended into a short funnel. The male and the female construct the nest together, keeping close when finding material and weaving it together. The inside linings of Cape sparrow nests can incorporate large portions of aromatic leaves such as wolbossie (Helichrysum pumilio), thyme (Thymus vulgaris), and camphor (Cinnamomum). This consistent use of aromatics suggests that they have some purpose such as protection against parasites.|$|E
5|$|Tremo gained Poniatowski's trust as {{the cook}} able to satisfy both his palate and his dietary requirements. The teetotal king {{suffered}} from gastric ailments {{from an early}} age. He usually started his day <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> of hot chocolate or bouillon. His favourite dish was roast or stewed mutton, which he washed down with spring water. Tremo often consulted royal menus with the court physician and occasionally prepared separate dishes specifically for the king to accommodate his sensitive stomach. Tomatoes, for example, were considered detrimental to the monarch's health and were never used in Tremo's recipes.|$|E

5|$|Two of the 8th century picture stones {{from the}} island of Gotland, Sweden depict eight-legged horses, which are thought by most {{scholars}} to depict Sleipnir: the Tjängvide image stone and the Ardre VIII image stone. Both stones feature a rider sitting atop an eight-legged horse, which some scholars view as Odin. Above the rider on the Tjängvide image stone is a horizontal figure holding a spear, which may be a valkyrie, and a female figure greets the rider <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup.</b> The scene has been interpreted as a rider arriving at {{the world of the}} dead. The mid-7th century Eggja stone bearing the Odinic name haras (Old Norse 'army god') may be interpreted as depicting Sleipnir.|$|E
25|$|In Judaism, ritual washing, or ablution, {{takes two}} main forms. A tevilah (טְבִילָה) {{is a full}} body {{immersion}} in a mikveh, and a netilat yadayim which is the washing of the hands <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> (see Handwashing in Judaism).|$|E
25|$|Two {{days prior}} to the execution, a letter written by Saddam {{appeared}} on the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party website. In the letter, he urged the Iraqi people to unite, and not to hate the people of countries that invaded Iraq, like the United States, but instead the decision-makers. He said {{he was ready to}} die as a martyr and he said that this is his death sentence. In the hours before the execution, Saddam ate his last meal of chicken and rice <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> of hot water and honey.|$|E

50|$|The {{post horn}} (also post-horn) is a valveless {{cylindrical}} brass instrument <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cupped</b> mouthpiece. The instrument {{was used to}} signal the arrival or departure of a post rider or mail coach. It was used especially by postilions of the 18th and 19th centuries.|$|R
25|$|Most brass {{instruments}} are fitted <b>with</b> <b>a</b> removable mouthpiece. Different shapes, sizes and styles of mouthpiece {{may be used}} to suit different embouchures, or to more easily produce certain tonal characteristics. Trumpets, trombones, and tubas are characteristically fitted <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cupped</b> mouthpiece, while horns are fitted <b>with</b> <b>a</b> conical mouthpiece.|$|R
25|$|The first {{recorded}} cricket match {{in what was}} known {{at the time as}} Rhodesia was played in August 1890 near Fort Victoria. Within the next ten years, matches were played with more regularity and the most significant match was between teams representing Salisbury and Bulawayo. In 1903 James Douglas Logan presented Rhodesia's cricket teams <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> to compete for, which was named the Logan Cup after him. At first-class level, Rhodesia entered a team in the South African Currie Cup in 1904–05, and then for most South African seasons from 1929–30 until 1978–79.|$|E
25|$|Despite a {{successful}} acting and singing career, Einstein considered himself shy and a homebody. In {{one of his}} songs he sang that his greatest pleasure was staying home <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> of lemon tea and his books, and in this he was sincere. In a candid TV interview he said that performing in front of big crowds was difficult for him (without {{the help of a}} few glugs of cognac beforehand). For this reason he ceased to perform public concerts after 1981, despite many attractive offers which in the late 1990s even reached seven figures. In 1982 he was hurt in a major car accident. His wife was also hurt, and another friend lost her life. Following the accident Einstein's eyesight, which was already myopic, got worse and he spent less time in public.|$|E
25|$|Images of {{children}} {{on the path to}} destruction also litter the scene: aside from the dead baby on the spike and the child falling to its death, a baby is quieted by its mother <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> of gin, and in the background of the scene an orphaned infant bawls naked on the floor as the body of its mother is loaded into a coffin on orders of the beadle. Two young girls who are wards of the parish of St Giles—indicated by the badge on the arm of one of the girls—each take a glass. Hogarth also chose the slum of St Giles as setting for the first scene of The Four Stages of Cruelty, which he issued almost simultaneously with Beer Street and Gin Lane. Tom Nero, the central character of the Cruelty series wears an identical arm badge. In front of the pawnbroker's door a starving boy and a dog fight over a bone, while next to them a girl has fallen asleep; approaching her is a snail, emblematic of the sin of sloth.|$|E

25|$|Tea Time is an oil {{painting}} on cardboard with dimensions 75.9 x 70.2cm (29.9 x 27.6 in), signed Metzinger and dated 1911 lower right. The painting represents a barely draped (nude) woman holding a spoon, {{seated at a}} table <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> of tea. In the 'background', the upper left quadrant, stands a vase on a commode, table or shelf. A square or cubic shape, a chair or painting behind the model, espouses the shape of the stretcher. The painting is practically square, like the side of a cube. The woman's head is highly stylized, divided into geometrized facets, planes and curves (the forehead, nose, cheeks, hair). The source of light appears to be off to her right, with some reflected light {{on the left side of}} her face. Reflected light, consistently, can be seen on other parts of her body (breast, shoulder, arm). Her breast is composed of a triangle and a sphere. The faceting of the rest of her body, to some extent, coincides with actual muscular and skeletal features (collar bone, ribcage, pectorals, deltoids, neck tissue). Both of here shoulders are coupled with elements of the background, superimposed, gradational and transparent to varying degrees. Unidentified elements are composed of alternating angular structures, The colors employed by Metzinger are subdued, mixed (either on a palette of directly on the surface), with an overall natural allure. The brushwork is reminiscent of Metzinger's Divisionist period (ca. 1903–1907), described by the critic (Louis Vauxcelles) in 1907 as large, mosaic-like 'cubes', used to construct small but highly symbolic compositions.|$|E
500|$|Breeding {{normally}} {{starts in}} early May, but often in April {{in the south}} of the range. Yellowhammers are monogamous and breed when aged one year. The males establish territories along hedges or woodland fringes and sing from a tree or bush, often continuing well into July or August. The male displays to the female by raising his wings and running towards her. The nest is built by the female on or near the ground, and is typically well hidden in tussocks, against a bank or low in a bush. It is constructed from nearby plant material, such as leaves, dry grass and stalks, and lined with fine grasses and sometimes animal hair. It is [...] across <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> [...] deep.|$|E
500|$|A male {{attracts a}} female to his {{territory}} through song and a display which involves rapid wing beating while perched. He will also build {{a number of}} simple nests (cock's nests) to show to his mate, although only rarely will she complete the structure, usually starting afresh. The nest is concealed in vegetation, the nature of which depends on local availability. Rubus species are commonly used in temperate regions, with willow predominating in alpine valleys. Sometimes, particularly in stinging nettles, the nest may be built around a number of vertical stems, {{in the manner of}} a reed warbler. The nest is normally between [...] above the ground, and very rarely higher than [...] The nest is a cup of dry grass, moss and twigs, with a soft lining of finer plant material or hair.

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Ironic" [...] was {{directed}} by Stéphane Sednaoui.|publisher=Allmusic. Rovi Corporation|accessdate=April 14, 2011}} In {{the beginning of the}} video, Morissette is at a gas station, walking to her automobile <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> of coffee in her hand. Then, she drives her car through a winter landscape, and she begins to sing the song's first verse. When it comes to the chorus, a second Morissette comes in. She is in a green sweater and sits in the backseat on the passenger side. When the first chorus ends, a third Morissette comes in, and she is in a yellow sweater with braided hair, also in the backseat, but on the driver's side. Along the way, the yellow Morissette is singing and eating at the same time, {{and when it comes to}} the second verse, a fourth and last Morissette comes in, she is in a red sweater sitting in the front passenger seat. During the second chorus, she climbs out of the window when they are still driving and almost gets knocked out by a bridge, but still manages a smile after doing so. The camera comes back to the driving Morissette, after the breakdown, and she takes off her hat, tosses it into the back seat, and becomes as loud as the other three while singing the song. When Morissette sings the outro, she is still driving through the winter landscape, and suddenly the car breaks down (possibly having run out of gas, which may be [...] "ironic" [...] in itself since the video started with her at a gas station). Morissette (as the driver) gets out of the car, and all her [...] "passengers" [...] have disappeared.|$|E
