40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>windmill</b> <b>brake</b> <b>state</b> model is {{considered}} in this paper. Blade Element Momentum (BEM) calculation often calculates {{the value of}} thrust coefficient in <b>windmill</b> <b>brake</b> <b>state.</b> Unfortunately, thrust coefficient predicted by momentum theory deviated dramatically from the experimental data when the value of axial induction factor is greater than 0. 5. To solve this problem and to increase {{the accuracy of the}} prediction, windmill break state model including tip loss effect must be applied to equations of thrust coefficient. The problem of interest is that which windmill break state model is suitable for the wind turbine model being simulated. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to compare the rotor power predicted by six different <b>windmill</b> <b>brake</b> <b>state</b> models. The aerodynamic code based on BEM theory has been implemented in Matlab and validated with the simulated result of AWT- 27 wind turbine model reported by National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). Six <b>windmill</b> <b>brake</b> <b>state</b> models to be compared are Glauert’s characteristic equation, classical brake state model, advanced brake state model, Wilson and Walker model, modified advanced brake state model, and Shen’s correction. The predicted power curves obtained from each <b>windmill</b> <b>brake</b> <b>state</b> model are compared to the measured power curve of AWT- 27 /P 4. It has been shown that Shen’s correction gives the highest correlation to the measured data with r-square of 0. 970 and the predicted annual energy production (AEP) is different from measured data by only 6. 3 %...|$|E
40|$|A {{planar model}} of a lifting surface {{descending}} into its own wake is constructed {{with the aim of}} demonstrating some underlying mechanisms of the ‘vortex ring ’ state that may be entered by a rotary wing aircraft during a vertical descent. The model uses line vortices that are periodically released from a point in space and then allowed to evolve in a constrained manner. For low descent velocities the model reproduces a hover state, where the wake vortices move downwards relative to the lifting plane. A critical descent speed is reached after which the model produces a quasi-periodic shedding of vortex agglomerations. This state is reached via a Hopf bifurcation of the steady state and persists until another critical descent velocity after which a steady <b>windmill</b> <b>brake</b> <b>state</b> is possible, in which vortices travel upwards in a regular manner. Unconstrained simulations reveal a more chaotic vortex pattern, but frequency analysis reveals an underlying structure similar to that shown for the constrained model. Besides offering a qualitative understanding of possible mechanisms of vortex ring state, the analysis suggests some dimensionless parameters that collapse the model data...|$|E

The experiment was performed in a 24. 4 -by- 36. 6 -m wind tunnel. We placed two sonic anemometers 0. 58 rotor diameters downwind of the rotor at hub height. One was positioned nominally behind the nacelle at 9 % radius and the second was placed 2 -m outboard at 49 % radius. The tunnel wind speed was varied from 5 to 25 meters per second (m/s) and the turbine rotor speed was held at 72 revolutions per minute (rpm). We varied yaw from 0 {degree} to 60 {degree}. The data showed unsteadiness in the wake due to the nacelle wake. Also, the unsteadiness increased {{with the onset of}} blade stall. The axial induction factor in the wake showed that the turbine was operating within the <b>windmill</b> <b>brake</b> <b>state</b> of actuator disk momentum theory. Little variation in unsteadiness was shown under yawed conditions. We also discovered that lateral velocity behind the nacelle was negative and would result in an unfurling normal force on a tail vane. The vertical velocity was shown to change sign under yawed conditions, conceivably {{as a result of the}} opposing blade root vortex...|$|E

However, the vehicle segmentation issues for the mobility robots, impede {{the use of these}} devices on the shared paths. The mobility reports can only be used in the designated areas and private facilities. The traffic regulatory institutions lack robot–society interaction database. In this study, we proposed methods and algorithms which can be employed on a widespread computing device, such as an Android tablet, to gather travel information and rider behavior making use of the motion and position sensors of the tablet PC. The methods we developed, first filter the noisy sensor readings using a complementary filter, then align the body coordinate system of the device to the Segway’s motion coordinate. A couple of state of the art classification methods are integrated to classify the <b>braking</b> <b>states</b> of the Segway. The classification algorithms are not limited to classification of the <b>braking</b> <b>states,</b> but they can be used for other motion related maneuvers on the road surfaces.

40|$|Abstract PSR B 0540 − 69 has braking index {{measurement}} in its persistent state: n = 2. 129 ± 0. 012. Recently, it {{is reported}} to have spin-down state changes: a suddenly 36 % increase in the spin-down rate. Combining the persistent <b>state</b> <b>braking</b> index measurement and different spin-down states, PSR B 0540 − 69 is more powerful than intermittent pulsars in constraining pulsar spin-down models. The pulsar wind model is applied to explain the variable timing behavior of PSR B 0540 − 69. The persistent <b>state</b> <b>braking</b> index of PSR B 0540 − 69 is the combined effect of magnetic dipole radiation and particle wind. The particle density reflects the magnetospheric activity in real-time and may be responsible for the changing spin-down behavior. Corresponding to the 36 % increase in the spin-down rate of PSR B 0540 − 69, the relative increase in the particle density is 88 % in the vacuum gap model. And the model calculated braking index in the new state is n = 1. 79. Future braking index observation of PSR B 0540 − 69 in the new spin-down state will be very powerful in distinguishing between different pulsar spin-down models and different particle acceleration models in the wind braking scenario. The variable timing behavior of PSR J 1846 − 0258 is also understandable in the pulsar wind model.
