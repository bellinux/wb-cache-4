The {{corrosion}} {{behaviors of}} {{304 stainless steel}} (304 SS) which has <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> and 304 SS which has not <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> in two different solutions were investigated using polarization curve and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) methods. The results show that 304 SS which has <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> and 304 SS which has not <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> have the similar corrosion voltage in two different solutions. However, the corrosion velocity of 304 SS which has <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> <b>is</b> more than 304 SS which has not <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> both in the two solutions and the corrosion behaviors of two 304 SS in the water solution are better than in the water which has little oil...|$|R
