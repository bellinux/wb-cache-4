40|$|<b>Water</b> <b>towers</b> are symbolical {{landmarks}} that {{refer to}} the industrialization. The oldest <b>water</b> <b>towers</b> are technical and industrial assets whose current and future evolution is a sensitive matter {{as a result of}} the economic context that brought about the closing of numerous industrial enterprises and abandoning infrastructure assets, including <b>water</b> <b>towers.</b> Some <b>water</b> <b>towers</b> were included on the national cultural-heritage lists across the world, thanks to the manifold values they incorporate (technological, historical, architectural, esthetical, among others). In this context, it has become necessary to convert them, with the twofold purpose of conserving them and assigning them a new function, for the local community members. Although there are numerous models for good practice in the conversion of <b>water</b> <b>towers</b> in several European countries, in Romania their reuse is a difficult process, most of the time burdened by shortcomings of legislation or lack of financial support. The study’s main purpose is to present reasons for the conversion of <b>water</b> <b>towers</b> and to highlight several good practice models, as well as to present several <b>water</b> <b>towers</b> with a high potential for conversion...|$|R
