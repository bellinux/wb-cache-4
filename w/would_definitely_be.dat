With its discontinuance in Japan, Agitos western release was consequently cancelled, however it was stated that Type-0 Online was being considered for international release in place of Agito.|$|E

The work group estimated that the purchase price of the vessel would be 30–70 million euro. One of the proposed alternatives was the conversion of the Finnish multipurpose icebreaker Fennica, built in 1993, to a spill response vessel, but this was not pursued further.|$|E

25|$|As a result, a study {{into the}} risks of bird strikes at KSIA was commissioned, with special {{attention}} being paid to the barn swallows at Mount Moreland. The study showed that the early morning dispersals of swallows generally happen before any scheduled arrivals or departures (earlier than 06:00), and the late afternoon swarms take place below the airport approach path, with only 5% of the birds protruding up into the path for {{a very short time}} (around 10 minutes). It was also noted that larger bird species, flying at higher altitudes, would pose more of a risk to aircraft than the swallows, such species already being a risk at Durban International Airport. The study concluded that it <b>would</b> <b>definitely</b> <b>be</b> possible for the airport and swallows to co-exist. Proposed risk mitigation measures included curtailing flight movements during the afternoon swarm, setting the glide slope approach to Runway 06 to 3.2 or 3.5 degrees rather than the standard 3 degrees (to stay above the birds), and the installation of a radar system that would monitor bird movements and be integrated into the operational plan of the airport.|$|E

500|$|With the GameCube, Nintendo {{tried to}} reclaim {{third-party}} developers and {{catch up to}} Sony's PlayStation 2 by featuring disc-based media and powerful system hardware. However, {{in the first year}} after its launch, Nintendo only sold 4.7 million consoles. In this climate of flagging sales, Capcom held a surprise press conference in Japan in November 2002, announcing five new titles for the GameCube: P.N.03, Viewtiful Joe, Dead Phoenix, Resident Evil 4, and Killer7.

500|$|The final general {{classification}} {{of the race}} <b>would</b> <b>definitely</b> <b>be</b> decided on this stage, {{and a majority of}} the observers believed that Pinot would lose his lead since he is not a great time trialist, meaning he is not at his best when fighting against the wind on rolling terrain. Geraint Thomas of Team Sky was only 34 seconds down coming into the stage and was among the favorites to take the overall victory. Tom Dumoulin (Giant-Alpecin) won the short prologue and was a contender for overall victory too since he is a time trial specialist, but he had 1' 24" [...] to make up for. Another contender for overall win was Simon Špilak of Team Katusha (47 seconds down). Fourth-placed Domenico Pozzovivo (Ag2r-La Mondiale) was an enigma, as he had mixed performances in time trials throughout his career.
