The characteristics of silver interlayer influenced friction weld are compared with the silver free dissimilar friction welding process. Particle fracture occurs commonly in welding process. It leads to poor quality of welds and decreases {{the strength of the}} weld. The introduction of silver interlayer reduces the particle fracture.

40|$|Welding is {{a common}} {{industrial}} process used to join metals and generates complex aerosols of potentially hazardous metal fumes and gases. Most long-time welders experience some type of respiratory disorder during their time of employment. The use of animal models {{and the ability to}} control the welding fume exposure in toxicology studies have been helpful in developing {{a better understanding of how}} welding fumes affect health. There are no studies that have performed a side-by-side comparison of the pulmonary responses from an animal toxicology welding fume study with the lung responses associated with chronic exposure to welding fume by a career welder. In this study, post-mortem lung tissue was donated from a long-time welder with a well-characterized work background and a history of extensive welding fume exposure. To simulate a long-term welding exposure in an animal model, Sprague-Dawley rats were treated once a week for 28 weeks by intratracheal instillation with 2 mg of a stainless steel, hard-surfacing welding fume. Lung tissues from the welder and the welding fume-treated rats were examined by light and electron microscopy. Pathological analysis of lung tissue collected from the welder demonstrated inflammatory cell influx and significant pulmonary injury. The poor and deteriorating lung condition observed in the welder examined in this study was likely due to exposure to very high levels of potentially toxic metal fumes and gases for a significant number of years due to work in confined spaces. The lung toxicity profile for the rats treated with welding fume was similar. For tissue samples from both the welder and treated rats, <b>welding</b> <b>particle</b> accumulations deposited and persisted in lung structures and were easily visualized using light microscopic techniques. Agglomerates of deposited welding particles mostly were observed within lung cells, particularly alveolar macrophages. Analysis of individual particles within the agglomerates showed that these particles were metal complexes with iron, chromium, and nickel being the most common metals present. In conclusion, long-term exposure to specific welding fume can lead to serious chronic lung disease characterized by significant particle deposition and persistence as demonstrated in both a human case study and rat model. Not only were the lung responses similar in the human and rat lungs, as evidenced by inflammatory cell influx and pulmonary disease, but the composition of individual welding particles and agglomerations in situ was comparable.

With the advent of modern technologies in manufacturing ammunition, which replace toxic compounds of lead, antimony and barium in the primer mixture by elements and compounds such as powdered aluminium, titanium, amorphous boron or calcium silicide, differentiation between gunshot residue and morphologically similar particles originating from other anthropogenic or natural sources becomes more difficult.

40|$|Most oxygen-extraction {{techniques}} are temperature-dependent, with higher temperatures resulting in higher oxygen yield. An example is hydrogen reduction, {{in which the}} optimum process temperature is 1050 C. However, glass-rich lunar soil begins to show the effects of sintering at temperatures of 900 C or lower. Sintering <b>welds</b> <b>particles</b> together due to viscous relaxation of the glass in the sample. One approach to avoid problems related to sintering, such as difficulty in removing waste material from the reactor, {{is to keep the}} soil in motion. One of several methods being studied to accomplish this is fluidized-bed processing techniques, in which the grains are kept in motion by the action of flowing reductant gas. The spent material can be removed from the chamber while still fluidized, or the fluidizing motion can continue until the material has cooled below approx. 500 C. Until end-to-end prototypes are built that can remove the heated soil, the most practical option is to keep the bed fluidized while cooling the waste material. As ISRU technology advances, another option will become valuable, which is to intentionally sinter the material to a great enough extent that it becomes a brick. The free iron in lunar soil is magnetic, and ferromagnetic bricks can be manipulated by robotic systems using electromagnetic end effectors. Finally, if an electromagnetic field is applied to the soil while the brick is being formed, the brick itself will become a magnet. This property can be used to create self-aligning bricks or other building materials that do not require fasteners.

40|$|Abstract: Rail {{transportation}} plays a {{major role}} in the transportation sector of South Africa and many other countries of the world. Trains are locomotives and carriages that travel on rail tracks. The trains steer with the wheel flange against the inside vertical face of the rail head or crown. This steering action produces wear due to the friction between the two steel surfaces moving relative to one another. It is observed that wear at curves is severe due to the high lateral forces of the wheel flange bearing against the rail crown, with very undesirable economic consequences. This study investigated steel rail material degradation at play between the sliding and the rubbing surfaces of the wheel flange on track by characterising some worn rail samples from Mayfair, Johannesburg, South Africa, rail line, with the aim to gain a better understanding of their wear mechanism. Chemical composition analysis of steel rail sample was conducted. Hardness and tensile behaviour of steel rail were measured and calculated, respectively. Microstructure features of the worn rail samples were also examined, using the stereoscope, microscope, and the Scanning Electron Microscope. Topography and roughness test analyses were also conducted. It was discovered that the examined worn out rail, which was originally produced from high carbon steel with pearlites and ferrites microstructure, undergoes a micro-structural evolution to form martensitic structure over the years of usage and exposure to environmental conditions mostly at the surface of the rail, which tends to become brittle. Some <b>welded</b> <b>particles</b> were also found to be interlocked in between the surfaces of the rail, causing gradual degradation and breakdown of the rail. These were caused by pressure shock and impact forces between the movement of the rail and the wheel flange. Hardness tests carried out on the top surfaces of 429, 432 and 591 VHN readings of steel rail compared to that of the sub inner part of 359, 352 and 338 VHN readings of steel track, found the top-surface to be harder.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to show the {{possibility}} to produce bulk metallic glass with severe plastic deformation. High pressure torsion was used to consolidate Zr-based metallic glass powder and deform it further to <b>weld</b> the powder <b>particles</b> together. The produced samples were investigated with Scanning electron microscope (SEM), Transmission electron microscope (TEM), Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) to check if the specimens are fully dense and have an amorphous structure. The results show that the specimens remain amorphous during high pressure torsion and the density depends on the applied strain. Additional Vickers hardness measurements enable a comparison with literature and show for Zr-based metallic glass powder typical values (approximately 500 HV) ...|$|R
40|$|Ultra-fine grained {{materials}} are presently thoroughly investigated {{due to their}} enhanced mechanical properties. Cryogenic milling {{is one of the}} severe plastic deformation methods, which allow production of these materials. Titanium powder was processed by cryogenic milling in liquid nitrogen and argon and consequently consolidated via spark plasma sintering method. In this work, the influence of milling conditions (liquid nitrogen vs. liquid argon, material of balls, duration and speed of milling, usage of stearic acid) on size and shape of powder particles, contamination and mechanical properties was investigated. Particle size reduction was generally not observed, while their morphology changed significantly. Using liquid nitrogen as a cooling medium leads to strong contamination of prepared material and consequently to its hardening and embrittlement. Stearic acid supresses cold <b>welding</b> of <b>particles</b> during milling and enhances its efficiency. It is possible to eliminate stearic acid from powder by cleaning in acetone before sintering, to prevent contamination of processed material. Microhardness increased, depending on milling efficiency (in liquid argon), from original 178 HV to 200 - 300 HV range. Increase of yield and ultimate stength was observed in compression tests while maintaining ductility [...] . ...|$|R
50|$|Nuggets are gold {{fragments}} weathered out of {{an original}} lode. They often show signs of abrasive polishing by stream action, and sometimes still contain inclusions of quartz or other lode matrix material. A 2007 study on Australian nuggets ruled out speculative theories of supergene formation via in-situ precipitation, cold <b>welding</b> of smaller <b>particles,</b> or bacterial concentration, since crystal structures {{of all of the}} nuggets examined proved they were originally formed at high temperature deep underground (i.e., they were of hypogene origin). Other precious metals such as platinum form nuggets in the same way. A later study of native gold from Arizona, US, based on lead isotopes indicates that {{a significant part of the}} mass in alluvial gold nuggets in this area formed within the placer environment.|$|R
40|$|One of the {{emerging}} risks in the engineering and electronic industries is the exposure of workers to ultrafine <b>particles</b> during (micro-) <b>welding</b> operations, i. e., processes used for joining two metal parts heated locally, which constitute the base metal, with or without addition of another metal which is the filler metal, melted between the edges to be joined. The process is accompanied by formation of metallic fumes arising from the molten metal {{as well as by}} the emission of metal fumes of variable composition depending on the alloys welded and fused. The aim of this paper is to investigate the number, concentration and size distribution of submicron particles produced by (micro-) <b>welding</b> processes. <b>Particle</b> number size distribution is continuously measured during (micro-) welding operations by means of two instruments, i. e., Fast Mobility Particle Sizer and Nanoparticle Surface Area Monitor. The temporal variation of the particle number size distribution across the peaks evidences the strong and fast-evolving contribution of nucleation mode particles: peak values are maintained for less than 10 s. The implication of such contribution on human health is linked to the high deposition efficiency of submicronic particles in the alveolar interstitial region of the human respiratory system, where gas exchange occurs...|$|R
