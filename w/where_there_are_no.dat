The Simpsons settle in The Outlands and meet Julian Assange—their unfriendly next-door neighbor who operates the WikiLeaks Headquarters there.|$|E
5|$|The Fiji parrotfinch is {{endemic to}} Fiji, {{where it is}} found on the four largest islands (Viti Levu, Vanua Levu, Taveuni and Kadavu) {{and also in the}} smaller western islands of the Mamanuca and the Yasawa groups. It is {{uncommon}} but widespread, found in both forested and open habitats, from sea level to at least 1,200m (3,900ft) on Viti Levu. It appears to be less common on Taveuni than the larger islands. It has adapted well to man-made habitats, and is seen in grasslands, pasture, rice paddies, parks and gardens. Many parrotfinch species are mainly forest birds, but American ornithologist Jared Diamond has suggested that in the central Pacific, <b>where</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> seed-eating munias occupying the open habitats, species such as Vanuatu's blue-faced parrotfinch and its Fijian relative have expanded into grassy areas of their islands to exploit the supply of seeds.|$|E
5|$|After enjoying life as {{a billionaire}} for a few days, Homer decides to throw a party before Burns returns. He heads to Moe's Tavern to buy some beer and invite his friends to the party. However, Moe informs Homer {{that he can not}} sell him alcohol on account of it being Sunday before 2:00 PM. After Homer is told {{the only way he could}} buy alcohol would be to sail out to {{international}} waters <b>where</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> laws, he and his friends (including his son Bart) set sail in Burns' private yacht to throw the party there. Back at the Mayo Clinic, Burns discovers that he not only has all previously discovered diseases, but numerous new diseases the doctors have just discovered in him. However, the sheer number of diseases prevents any one disease from actually doing harm to him. This leads Burns to (incorrectly) conclude that he is indestructible, even though the doctors protest that even a slight breeze could disrupt the balance in his body.|$|E

5|$|Sea {{transportation}} {{is the primary}} mode of transportation linking Romblon with Luzon and islands in the Visayas. Inter-island ferries, RORO, and cargo ships from Manila, the southern Luzon ports of Batangas City, Lucena City in Quezon province, Roxas, Oriental Mindoro, and Roxas City in Capiz province are the primary modes of transportation linking the province {{to the rest of}} the country. Montenegro Lines, 2GO, and Romblon Shipping Lines all have ferry service from Manila to the main ports of entry of Odiongan and the capital town of Romblon and vice versa. From Romblon, Montenegro also serves Magdiwang in Sibuyan, while Romblon Shipping Lines also serves Cajidiocan. Pump boats and wooden launches also link the province to the towns of Buenavista, Marinduque and Pinamalayan, Oriental Mindoro. These pump boats are also used in going to barangays <b>where</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> existing road networks or between municipalities in the province that do not have existing ferry service.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} from Raw was a Last Man Standing match, where {{the goal is}} to {{incapacitate}} the opponent long enough for a 10-count. In his third match of the night, Triple H defended his WWE Championship against Randy Orton. Both men fought extensively outside the ring, both taking advantage of the match stipulations, <b>where</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> countouts or disqualifications. At one point, both men were positioned on top of one of the broadcast tables, where Orton attempted an RKO on Triple H, who countered the move and sent Orton through another of the broadcast tables. Triple H followed this by striking Orton with the steel steps. The men returned to the ring, and Orton performed a DDT and an RKO on Triple H, both onto a steel chair. The competitors returned to the outside of the ring again, and Triple H struck Orton with a chair. They returned {{to the top of the}} broadcast table, and Triple H attempted a Pedigree through the table on Orton, who countered into an RKO onto the table. The referee began a count and reached ten before Triple H could rise; in result, Orton won the match and subsequently regained the WWE Championship.|$|E
5|$|The other {{predominant}} rivalry {{heading into}} the event was between Matt Hardy and Edge, a real life issue transformed into a storyline. At SummerSlam, Edge defeated Hardy after dropping him onto {{the top of a}} ring post. This was scripted to caused Hardy to bleed heavily, which forced the referee to end the match and declare Edge the winner because Hardy could not continue. The next night on Raw, Hardy had a match with Rob Conway, in which Conway pinned Hardy for the win. After the match, Edge attacked Hardy. On the August 29 episode of Raw, Edge and Hardy were scheduled to compete in a Street Fight, a match <b>where</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> disqualifications, no countouts, and scoring conditions can occur anywhere in the arena. The match ended in a no-contest after Hardy and Edge brawled at the stage ramp. Hardy grabbed Edge by the side and threw both himself and Edge off the stage and into electrical equipment. Both Hardy and Edge laid motionless on the floor as sparks flew everywhere. Trainers and emergency medical technicians rushed to the scene and took both men away in ambulances for medical attention. The following week, Bischoff booked Hardy and Edge in a steel cage match at Unforgiven, where the ring would be enclosed by a steel cage. Following the announcement, Bischoff scheduled a match between Hardy and Snitsky, which Hardy lost. After the match, Snitsky threatened to hit Hardy with a ring bell but The Big Show came down. He was unable to stop Snitsky, and as a result, Snitsky succeeded in hitting Hardy with the bell.|$|E
