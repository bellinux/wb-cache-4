5|$|The {{restrictions}} were also applied to television drama, documentary and discussion programmes. In December 1988 the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Tom King, ordered Channel 4 to cancel {{an episode of}} the US drama series Lou Grant that featured {{the story of a}} fictional IRA gunrunner, even though it had aired previously. Mother Ireland, a 1988 documentary about women and Irish nationalism that included an interview with Mairéad Farrell, subsequently shot dead during an SAS operation in Gibraltar, was also initially banned. When screened by Channel 4 during a season about censorship in April 1991, Farrell's words on republicanism were muted, with on-screen subtitles. On a later occasion the appearance of the political activist Bernadette Devlin McAliskey on an edition of the BBC's Nation discussing reasons for political violence was also censored when much of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> was subtitled.|$|E
5|$|Aoyama collapses {{from the}} drug. Asami injects {{him with a}} paralytic agent that leaves his nerves alert, and tortures him with needles. She tells him that just like {{everyone}} else in her life, he has failed to love only her. She cannot tolerate his feelings for anyone else, even his own son. She inserts needles into his eyes, giggling as she does so. She then cuts off his left foot with piano wire. Shigehiko returns home as Asami begins to cut off Aoyama's other foot, and she chases him upstairs. As she attacks the boy, Aoyama appears to suddenly wake up back in the hotel after he and Asami had sex, and his current ordeal seems to be only a nightmare; Aoyama proposes marriage and Asami accepts. As he falls back asleep in the hotel, he returns to find his son fighting back Asami, who is brandishing mace. Shigehiko kicks her downstairs, breaking her neck. Aoyama tells his son to call the police and stares at the dying Asami, who repeats <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> on one of their dates about her excitement on seeing him again.|$|E

5|$|Michael and Dwight {{meet with}} Jan, {{who is now}} a fairly {{successful}} office manager for a hospital and single mother. After Jan gives Michael a brutal description of why their relationship failed and he watches her play with her daughter Astrid, Michael reveals that he has herpes. He meets with Helene, Pam's mother, who is playing with CeCe at a playground; after an awkward conversation in which she also points out his skewed memory, he insults her and walks off. He meets with Carol while she is conducting an open house. Carol attempts to be polite, but then abruptly points out his faults too. Finally, Michael calls Holly one last time, only to get her voicemail. He leaves her a heartfelt message that <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> hurt him and that when he saw all his other exes, he had not been happy to see any of them, but when he talked to her, he was happy. He says that does not understand why she wants to downplay what they had, but he remembers their relationship perfectly and considers it special. Before hanging up, he awkwardly adds that she should be tested for herpes.|$|E

25|$|The Court {{announced}} its decision May 31, 1994.

25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1429 during the Hundred Years' War, in {{obedience}} to <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> was the command of God, Joan of Arc inspired the Dauphin's armies {{in a series of}} stunning military victories which lifted the siege of Orleans and destroyed {{a large percentage of the}} remaining English forces at the battle of Patay. A series of military setbacks eventually led to her capture in the Spring of 1430 by the Burgundians, who were allied with the English. They delivered her to them for 10,000 livres. In December of that same year she was transferred to Rouen, the military headquarters and administrative capital in France of King Henry VI of England, and placed on trial for heresy before a Church court headed by Bishop Pierre Cauchon, a supporter of the English.|$|E
25|$|At the Walford In Bloom competition, {{there is}} a gas {{explosion}} and Martin is panicked when he cannot find Stacey and hits a police officer, resulting in two weeks imprisonment. When Kush suffers a cardiac arrest, he is diagnosed with Brugada Syndrome, which is hereditary. Stacey worries that Arthur could die and tells Bex {{about the possibility of}} Arthur having the syndrome. A doctor assures Stacey that the chance of Arthur displaying symptoms at a young age is small. After Stacey misses Lily's dance show, she tells Lily about Arthur's condition. Stacey is annoyed with Whitney when she takes Lily and Arthur for breakfast and Lily is fed up of being ignored by an exhausted Stacey. When Lily refuses to eat her tea, Stacey physically takes Lily to go upstairs in the presence of Carmel, who refuses to leave Stacey with Lily and Arthur. Arthur undergoes an ECG and Stacey, Kush and Martin are told by the specialist that Arthur is at high risk at having the condition, but cannot have an operation or tests like Kush due to his age. Stacey is anxious that Arthur having a cardiac arrest is a sign of the condition and his parents are told about equipment that is not available on the NHS. Stacey is angry with Martin that he asked Kush for money to buy the equipment. Stacey and Martin panic when Arthur will not wake up, and when they receive Arthur's medical records at the hospital, Stacey and Martin are told that Arthur has swallowed Stacey's bipolar medication. Carmel is horrified when she finds bruises on Arthur's arms, and expresses her concerns to Kush that Stacey is unwell, while Stacey tells her sister-in-law Michelle Fowler (Jenna Russell) that he gained the bruises in hospital. However, Lily tells Carmel that Stacey was responsible, so Carmel reports it to social services, but tries to retract <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> after realising it was a mistake. Social services visit Stacey and Martin and tell them they received a report about Arthur. Arthur and Lily are placed in Carmel's care until social services have investigated. Arthur is looked over by a doctor, who has no concerns and Stacey and Martin can have Arthur and Lily back. Social worker Fiona Payne (Sandra James-Young) tells Stacey and Martin she will be conducting further home visits. Lily tells Stacey and Martin that she injured Arthur. After speaking with Lily, Fiona tells Stacey and Martin that Lily feels pushed out with Arthur and is anxious about the new baby. Kush and Carmel admit Carmel called social services, enraging Stacey, who bans them both from seeing Arthur before suffering an eclamptic seizure. She is taken to hospital, where her and Martin are told her baby will have to be delivered prematurely {{due to a lack of}} oxygen. The baby is delivered, though Martin is told that there are complications. Stacey goes to see her daughter, but changes her mind and snaps at Martin for allowing Carmel to look after Lily. Stacey later sees her daughter. Stacey and Martin's daughter is put on a ventilator. Stacey grows annoyed at Martin suggesting baby names, but confides in Max about her feelings. Stacey apologises to Martin and they name their daughter Hope.|$|E

Taylor said it remained a good idea, as she felt that only Star Trek could have a character changed into the body of the child and yet still fly the ship.

Roger and Jane go to the party, which is hosted by Jane's therapist and her husband. After dinner, Roger asks Jane if they can leave, but Jane reminds Roger that he agreed to take LSD with the group and begs him to stay, as she doesn't want to go through the experience alone. Roger is initially unimpressed with the drug but comes around after his consciousness begins to change with vivid audio-visual hallucinations. Roger and Jane return home via taxi and take a bath together, during which Roger imagines he is watching the 1919 World Series from the bathtub. The couple then talks candidly about their marriage for the first time. During this moment of awareness, Jane admits that she knows the marriage is over. The next morning, a jovial Roger says goodbye to a shocked Jane, who appears regretful about <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> the night before.|$|E

In November 2010 she appeared on the British television show Later... with Jools Holland, performing [...] "Born Free" [...] and [...] "It Takes a Muscle", the latter with members of The Specials. While promoting the album, M.I.A. became involved in a dispute with Lynn Hirschberg of The New York Times, who interviewed her in March 2010 and whose resulting article portrayed the singer as pretentious and attention seeking. In response, M.I.A. posted Hirschberg's telephone number on her Twitter page and later uploaded her own audio recording of the interview, highlighting the discrepancies between <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> and what was reported. The piece was criticised for its yellow journalism by some, however M.I.A. received varying degrees of support and criticism for the ensuing fallout from the media. Benjamin Boles wrote in Now that, while Hirschberg's piece came across as a [...] "vicious ... character assassination", M.I.A's subsequent actions were [...] "childish" [...] and made her [...] "the laughing stock of the internet". The paper later printed a correction on the story, acknowledging that some quotes had been taken out of context. The incident prompted Boots Riley of the band Street Sweeper Social Club to comment on how artists had access to media that allowed writers to be held accountable and that M.I.A.'s move was [...] "brilliant".|$|E
