40|$|This publication, the Natural Gas Monthly, {{presents}} {{the most recent}} data on natural gas supply, consumption, and prices from the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Of special interest in this issue are two articles summarizing reports recently published by EIA. The articles are {open_quotes}Natural Gas Productive Capacity{close_quotes} and {open_quotes}Outlook for Natural Gas Through 2015,{close_quotes} both of which precede the {open_quotes}Highlights{close_quotes} section. With this issue, January 1997, changes {{have been made to}} the format of the Highlights section and to several of the tabular and graphical presentations throughout the publication. The changes to the Highlights affect the discussion of developments in the industry and the presentation of <b>weekly</b> <b>storage</b> data. An overview of the developments in the industry is now presented in a brief summary followed by specific discussions of supply, end-use consumption, and prices. Spot and futures prices are discussed as appropriate in the Price section, together with wellhead and consumer prices...|$|E
40|$|Raggovidda {{wind farm}} is assumed {{expanded}} from 45 MW to 200 MW, and hydrogen is assumed produced from excess wind power. The grid restriction is 50 MW, and whenever the wind power exceeds 50 MW, hydrogen is produced. Based on a Weather Research and Forecast model run by Kjeller Vindteknikk, {{as well as}} wind- and production data from Raggovidda wind farm, a time-series of 20 years of wind power with an hourly resolution is developed. With this as an input, hydrogen production is simulated {{with the use of}} Python. Alkaline atmospheric electrolysers of 2. 3 MW are considered. Liquid storage and delivery is considered the best solution. The storage is assumed emptied once a week, and hydrogen is delivered by two liquid carrier ships in shuttle with a range of 2, 000 - 2, 500 nautic miles. Electrolyser and storage capacity are design variables. Liquefaction capacity follows from the electrolysis maximum output, and the ship size required follows from the storage capacity. By minimizing production costs, the optimal dimensions of the plant are found. The optimal electrolysis capacity ranges from 103. 5 – 151. 8 MW and the optimal <b>weekly</b> <b>storage</b> ranges from 300 – 400 tons of hydrogen, provided a 5 % result cost interval. This requires a liquefaction capacity of 49 – 58 tons/day, and a carrier ship size of 4, 240 - 5, 650 m 3. The minimum production cost is calculated to 4. 23 – 4. 34 EUR/kg. With a charge of about 10 EUR/kg hydrogen at refuelling stations, a revenue of more than 5 EUR/kg may be achievable, provided no VAT or taxes are added. M-M...|$|E
40|$|The {{short-term}} forecasting of {{wave energy}} {{is important to}} provide guidance for the electric power operation and power transmission system and to enhance the efficiency of energy capture and conversion. This study produced a numerical forecasting experiment of the China Sea wave energy using WAVEWATCH-III (WW 3, the latest version 4. 18) wave model driven by T 213 (WW 3 -T 213) and T 639 (WW 3 -T 639) wind data separately. Then the WW 3 -T 213 and WW 3 -T 639 were verified and compared to build a short-term wave energy forecasting structure suited for the China Sea. Considering the value of wave power density (WPD), “wave energy rose,” daily and <b>weekly</b> total <b>storage</b> and effective storage of wave energy, this study also designed a series of short-term wave energy forecasting productions. Results show that both the WW 3 -T 213 and WW 3 -T 639 exhibit a good skill on the numerical forecasting of the China Sea WPD, while the result of WW 3 -T 639 is much better. Judging from WPD and daily and <b>weekly</b> total <b>storage</b> and effective storage of wave energy, great wave energy caused by cold airs was found. As there are relatively frequent cold airs in winter, early spring, and later autumn in the China Sea and the surrounding waters, abundant wave energy ensues...|$|R
40|$|The {{tolerance}} to degradation processes in meat of nine Trichinella genotypes was studied in mouse and fox tissue, respectively. Minced muscle tissue with Trichinella larvae of different age was stored {{at room temperature}} at 100 % relative humidity. During <b>storage</b> <b>weekly</b> sub samples of the minced meat were digested and released larvae were inoculated in mice to evaluate the Reproductive Capacity Index (RCI). The RCI decreased with the length of storage, but the larvae from older infections appeared better adapted to tolerate the degradation processes. The African species T. nelsoni had a relative higher {{tolerance to}} elevated temperature during storage and the unencysted species T. pseudospiralis was the most vulnerable genotype...|$|R
40|$|Ascorbic acid (AA), or vitamin C, {{is widely}} used in the pharmaceutical, {{cosmetic}} and food industries as an antioxidant and cosmetics containing AA have been gaining popularity {{in the last few}} years for the treatment of photoageing. To solve the problem of its low stability, some esters have been synthesised, such as magnesium ascorbyl phosphate (MAP), also available encapsulated in collagen-based microspheres (EMAP). The aim of this research was to study the physical and chemical stability of O/W emulsions containing AA, MAP or EMAP, by rheological and HPLC analysis, respectively. These emulsions were stored at 25, 37 and 45 °C for 28 days and samples tested <b>weekly</b> during <b>storage.</b> It was concluded that all the formulations showed pseudoplastic behaviour. The presence of MAP provoked an initial rise in thixotropy. The formulation containing AA did not show any marked change in rheological behaviour. In the chemical analysis, the formulation with EMAP was more stable than those with MAP and AA. Hence, replacement of AA with EMAP in this cosmetic formulation may be a viable way to enhance the stability of the active principle. Keywords: Ascorbic acid. Magnesium ascorbyl phosphate.

40|$|Locally {{prepared}} meals, borak, {{were treated}} with 0, 2, 4 and 6 kGy doses of gamma irradiation. Treated and untreated borak were kept in a refrigerator (1 – 4 °C). Microbiological and chemical analyses were performed on each treated sample immediately after processing, and <b>weekly</b> throughout <b>storage</b> period, which lasted for 6 weeks. Sensory evaluation and proximate analysis were done within one week after irradiation. Results of the proximate analysis of borak showed that irradiation doses {{did not have a}} significant effect on moisture, protein and fat content of borak. Gamma irradiation decreased the total counts of mesophilic aerobic bacteria, total coliform and yeast and increased the shelf life of borak. The radiation doses required to reduce the microorganisms load by one log cycle (D 10) in borak were 456 and 510 Gy for the Salmonella spp. and E. coli, respectively. Three chemical parameters, total acidity, lipid peroxide and volatile basic nitrogen, which were chosen as the indices of freshness, were all well within the acceptable limits for up to 1, 3 and 6 weeks at 1 – 4 °C for samples treated with 2, 4 and 6 kGy, respectively. Sensory evaluation showed no significant differences between irradiated and non-irradiated samples. ...|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} year of {{operating}} the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the amount of transient accelerator data to be persisted and analysed has been steadily growing. Since the startup of the LHC in 2006, the amount of <b>weekly</b> data <b>storage</b> requirements exceeded what the systems was initially designed to accommodate in a full year of operation. Moreover, it is predicted that the data acquisition rates {{will continue to increase}} in the future, due to foreseen improvements in the infrastructure within the scope of the High Luminosity LHC project. Despite the efforts for improving and optimizing the current data storage infrastructures (CERN Accelerator Logging Service and Post Mortem database), some limitations still persist and require a different approach to scale up efficiently to provide efficient services for future machine upgrades. This project aims to explore one of the possibilities among novel solutions proposed {{to solve the problem of}} working with large datasets. The configuration is composed of Spark for data processing and Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) with Parquet format for data storage. This setup tries to enable fast data access without sacrificing the performance of analytical queries (which require large amounts of data to be processed). The workload configurations used in the benchmarking were adapted from previous studies performed by TE-MPE-MS team...|$|R
40|$|Different storage {{technologies}} enable {{an increasing}} share of variable renewable generation in the electricity system {{by reducing the}} temporal mismatch between generation and demand. Two storage ratings are essential to time-shift delivery of electricity to loads: electric power, or instantaneous electricity flow [W], and electric energy, or power integrated over time [Wh]. An optimal storage portfolio is likely composed of multiple technologies, each having specific power and energy ratings. This paper derives and explains {{the link between the}} shape of the time-varying demand and generation profiles and the amount of desirably installed storage capacity, both energy and power. An analysis is performed for individual storage technologies first, showing a link between the necessary power and energy capacity and the demand and generation profile. Then combinations of storage technologies are analyzed to reveal their mutual interaction in a storage portfolio. Results show an increase in desirability for storage technologies with low cost power ratings when the mismatch between generation and demand occurs in daily to <b>weekly</b> cycles. <b>Storage</b> technologies with low cost energy ratings are preferred when this mismatch occurs in monthly to seasonal cycles. The findings of this work can help energy system planners and policy makers to explain results from generation expansion planning studies and to isolate the storage benefits accountable to temporal arbitrage in broader electricity storage studies. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|During routine storage, packed {{red blood}} cells (PRBC) undergo {{biochemical}} and morphological changes including loss of red blood cell (RBC) membrane asymmetry and release of microparticles (MPs) bearing phosphatidylserine (PS), a procoagulant phospholipid. This study investigated the association between PRBC storage duration, MP profile and procoagulant activity. Leucodepleted PRBC-supernatant (PRBC-SN; n= 13) was prepared at <b>weekly</b> intervals throughout <b>storage.</b> Phospholipid-dependent procoagulant activity, assessed using a factor X-activated clotting time (XACT) assay, decreased throughout storage (P +). Depletion of MPs from stored (D 42) PRBC-SN using 0. 22 µm filters reduced the number of PS-bearing MPs (P < 0. 01) but did not increase XACT clotting times. Furthermore, the reduction in procoagulant activity when lactadherin was used to block PS was not altered pre- or post-filtration of PRBC-SN. In conclusion, routine PRBC storage was associated with accumulation of MPs (particularly RBC-derived PS-bearing MPs) and of procoagulant phospholipids; however, depletion of PS-bearing MPs by 0. 22 µm filtration did not reduce phospholipid-dependent procoagulant activity...|$|R
40|$|Avocado (Persea {{americana}} Mill. cv. Hass) fruit {{were stored}} at 2, 5, and 8 °C {{for four weeks}} to determine maximum cold-storage life. Skin colour, fruit firmness, mesocarp ap-pearance, pectinmethylesterase (PME), polygalacturonase (PG), and cellulase (CX) activity were determined <b>weekly</b> during cold <b>storage,</b> and {{three times a week}} during subsequent transfer to 22 °C. Fruit held at 2 °C remained hard green during four weeks, and ripened normally upon removal to 22 °C. At the two higher temperatures fruit ripening started during storage. At 5 ”C, ripening commenced during the fourth week of storage, and minor mesocarp discolouration was observed at full ripeness at 22 °C. Fruit held at 8 °C ripened after two weeks in storage, resulting in more intense mesocarp discolouration and vascular browning at full ripeness, upon transfer to 22 °C. For current Australian commercial storage of avocados cv. Hass, 7 °C is too warm, and may be reduced to 2 °C for preclimacteric fruit. Results indicate that fruit held at 2 °C can be stored for at least four weeks, and possibly five weeks without injury...|$|R
40|$|The {{seasonal}} storage hydrogen peak electricity supply system (SSHPESS) is a gigawatt-year hydrogen storage system which stores excess electricity produced as hydrogen during off-peak periods and consumes the stored hydrogen to produce electricity during peak periods of electricity demand. This thesis investigated and produced high-level system requirements and designs for an SSHPESS. To determine the daily, weekly, and seasonal requirements, analytical and numerical models were developed for all-nuclear, all-wind, and all-solar electricity coupled to storage systems. The electricity demand characteristics were obtained using actual electricity demand data from power grid operators from the North-East and South-West United States (New England, New York, PJM, and California). For an all-nuclear system, {{it was assumed}} that electricity was produced at a constant rate. For the wind and solar generating systems, real wind and solar data were obtained using models of wind and solar trough electricity systems. The analyses of the demand characteristics show that for a system containing only base-load plants (all-nuclear electricity systems) with lossless large-scale electricity storage systems, the base-load demand would increase by 50 % relative to current electrical infrastructure and 93 % of the electricity would be sent directly to customers. About 7 % of the annual electricity production would be sent to storage at times of low electricity demand for use at times of high electricity demand. The " 7 % Nuclear Electricity to Storage Ratio" is applicable to all the power grids considered. Analyses done for inefficient storage systems show that about 11 % of the energy produced is sent to storage. The results also show that all-nuclear electricity system requires the least amount of energy storage capacity for seasonal energy storage. As an example, the California grid data is shown below assuming the H 2 storage system meets hourly, daily, or <b>weekly</b> energy <b>storage</b> needs. by Isaiah Olanrewaju Oloyede. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Many {{investigators}} have proposed causes {{for changes in}} potato chip color. The caramelization of reducing sugars in potatoes is one factor associated with the dark discoloration of chips during the cooking process. However, it is generally recognized {{that some of the}} colored products which form in potato chips during processing do so {{as a result of the}} Maillard or Browning reaction. In this study, it was thought of primary importance to obtain data on the concentration of the sugars and amino acids, as affected by variation in <b>storage</b> temperatures at <b>weekly</b> intervals of <b>storage.</b> Also, it was felt that information could be gained in tracing changes in the chemical compounds of potatoes of different varieties from different locations. These data could be correlated with the potato chip color, thus explaining the part played by the sugars and amino acids in relation to the characteristics of different varieties from different locations. The objectives of the investigations were to: 1. Determine the quantitative changes in amino acids during cold storage and reconditioning with various varieties. 2. Determine the changes in total and reducing sugars during cold storage and reconditioning with various varieties. 3. Determine the changes in oil content, chip yield and dry matter of potato chips through the course of study. 4. Describe the mechanisms whereby these differences in sugars and amino acids may arise.

40|$|In {{the region}} of the Paraíba do Sul river valley in the State of São Paulo, Brazil, pasture areas have been {{replaced}} by eucalyptus plantations, which can modify the dynamics of water in the soils of the region. The objective of this work was to evaluate the behavior of water in a Red-Yellow Latosol in two vegetative coverings, a six-year-old eucalyptus plantation, and a native forest, in the process of regeneration which began twenty years ago. The study was developed in the Una River basin from June 2009 to April 2011. The soil water potential was measured by 96 sensors (Watermark ™) at the depths of 20, 60 and 120 cm. The Available Water Capacity (AWC) and <b>weekly</b> residual soil <b>storage</b> for each layer were calculated. It was observed that the three layers reacted to the processes of rainfall and evapotranspiration and that there was a difference between the storage of water in the soil in the eucalyptus and native forest areas. There was no water restriction in the studied period; however, the variations in native forest storage were smoother than the variations occurring for eucalyptus. In the mean of the whole period and for the three layers, the storage in the native forest and eucalyptus were 88 % and 64 % of Available Water Capacity (AWC = 183 mm), respectively. These results show the native forest water conservation capacity in watersheds...|$|R
