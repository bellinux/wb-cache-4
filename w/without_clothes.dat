25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Victorian period, working people of both sexes bathed for pleasure <b>without</b> <b>clothes.</b> The genteel classes were bathing for health from using bathing machines, the men and boys swam naked while the girls and women dipped alongside them. Near the University of Oxford an area for male nude bathing was known as Parson's Pleasure.|$|E
25|$|Many people regard visible tan {{lines as}} un-aesthetic, {{and seek to}} avoid tan lines that will be visible when regular clothes are worn. Some people try to achieve an all-over tan or to {{maximize}} their tan coverage. To achieve an all-over tan, tanners need to minimize the amount of clothing they wear while tanning. For women who cannot dispense with a swimsuit, they at times tan with the back strap undone while lying on the front, or removing shoulder straps, besides wearing swimsuits which cover less area than their normal clothing. Any exposure is subject to local community standards and personal choice. Some people tan {{in the privacy of}} their backyard where they can at times tan <b>without</b> <b>clothes,</b> and some countries have set aside clothing-optional swimming areas (popularly known as nude beaches), where people can tan and swim clothes-free. Some people tan topless, and others wear very brief swimwear, such as a microkini or thong.|$|E

500|$|... "Guardian Forces", {{creatures who}} are brought into battle to attack enemies or support the party, are {{the version of}} summons {{appearing}} in Final Fantasy VIII. Nomura felt they should be unique beings, <b>without</b> <b>clothes</b> or other human-like concepts. This was problematic, as {{he did not want}} them to [...] "become the actual monsters", so he took great care in their design. Ramuh—an old wizard from earlier Final Fantasy games—was replaced; other human-like designs were re-imagined nude and with creature-like elements. Nomura, also the director of the Guardian Force animation sequences, wanted to create a greater impact than the summons of Final Fantasy VII. Leviathan was created as a test and included in a game demo. Garnering a positive reaction from players, Nomura decided to create the remaining sequences in a similar fashion.|$|E
500|$|... "Kaboom" [...] {{was written}} by Aisha Muharrar and {{directed}} by Charles McDougall. The Pawnee pit, {{which has been a}} focal plot device in Parks and Recreation since the first episode, is filled in during this episode. [...] "Kaboom" [...] features actor and comedian Paul Scheer in a guest appearance as the KaBOOM! organizer. Scheer has previously worked with Aziz Ansari on the MTV sketch comedy show, Human Giant. [...] "Kaboom" [...] also featured H. Jon Benjamin, a voice actor from Archer, Dr. Katz, and Home Movies, as Pawnee's lawyer. Chris Pratt actually appeared naked during filming of a scene in which he arrived at Ann's house <b>without</b> <b>clothes</b> on.

500|$|Michael Schur, co-creator of Parks and Recreation, said [...] "Boys' Club" [...] marked {{an attempt}} to better develop Andy Dwyer. Schur said, [...] "We {{definitely}} wanted to dimensionalize his character and not make him just a one-dimensional douchebag." [...] In the episode, Andy plays a tape of himself singing a song called [...] "Ann", which he wrote as a romantic ballad for her. Chris Pratt actually wrote and performed the song himself for the show, although {{he said in an}} interview, [...] "it really wasn't much". Pratt actually appeared on set naked while filming the scene in which he chases Lawrence through the streets <b>without</b> <b>clothes</b> on. Schur said the scene was written because Pratt [...] "loves taking his clothes off". It proved difficult to film the scenes with Pratt bathing in the children's pool because the bubbles disappeared so quickly that multiple takes were required. The scenes with Andy running naked through the streets with his crutches to get his boombox back were inspired by a real-life experience from the set. During filming, an announcement was made that specialty coffees were available for the cast and crew, and Pratt ran quickly after them with the crutches. Greg Daniels added it to [...] "Boys' Club" [...] because he found the experience extremely funny.|$|E

500|$|To {{maintain}} a foreign atmosphere, {{the characters of}} the game were designed to have predominantly European appearances. The first Final Fantasy VIII character created was Squall. Desiring to add a unique angle to Squall's appearance and emphasize {{his role as the}} central character, Nomura gave him a scar across his brow and the bridge of his nose. As there was not yet a detailed history conceived for the character, Nomura left the explanation for Squall's scar to scenario writer Kazushige Nojima. Squall was given a gunblade, a fictional revolver–sword hybrid that functions primarily as a sword, with an added damaging vibration feature activated by use of its gun mechanism, similar to a vibroblade. His character design was complemented by a fur lining along the collar of his jacket, incorporated by Nomura as a challenge for the game's full motion video designers. Additionally, some designs Nomura had previously drawn, but had not yet used in a Final Fantasy game, were incorporated into Final Fantasy VIII. These were the designs of Edea, Fujin and Raijin. The latter two had originally been designed for use in Final Fantasy VII, but with the inclusion of the Turks characters in that game, it was felt that Fujin and Raijin were unnecessary. Nomura had designed Edea before the development of Final Fantasy VII, based on the style of Yoshitaka Amano. For the Guardian Forces, Nomura felt they should be unique beings, <b>without</b> <b>clothes</b> or other human-like concepts. This was problematic, as he did not want them to [...] "become the actual monsters", so he took great care in their design. Leviathan was the first GF, created as a test and included in a game demo.

2500|$|Even in prison, O'Brien {{continued}} his protests, refusing to wear prison uniform in 1887. Being left <b>without</b> <b>clothes,</b> a Blarney tweed suit was smuggled in. He occasionally wore this much publicised suit in the Commons when confronting his incarcerator, Arthur Balfour. His imprisonment also inspired protests – notably the 1887 'Bloody Sunday' riots in London. In 1889 he escaped from a courtroom but was sentenced in absentia for conspiracy. He fled to America accompanied by Dillon {{who was on}} bail, then to France where both held negotiations with Parnell at Boulogne-sur-Mer over {{the leadership of the}} party. When these broke down, both returned to Folkestone giving themselves up, subsequently serving four months in Clonmel and Galway gaols. Here O'Brien began to reconsider his political future, having already been prosecuted nine times over years, using the time to write an acclaimed novel, a Fenian romance with a land reform theme set in 1860: When We Were Boys, [...] which was published in 1890.|$|E

2500|$|In 1942, the U.S. Forest Service {{commissioned}} a pole to commemorate Alexander Baranof, the Russian governor and Russian American Company manager, {{as a civilian}} works project. The pole's original intent was to commemorate a peace treaty between the Russians and Tlingits that the governor helped broker in 1805. George Benson, [...] a Sitka carver and craftsman, created the original design. The completed version originally stood in Totem Square in downtown Sitka, Alaska. When Benson and other Sitka carvers were not available to do the work, the U.S. Forest Service had CCC workers carve the pole in Wrangell, Alaska. Because Sitka and Wrangell native groups were rivals, {{it has been argued}} that the Wrangell carvers may have altered Benson's original design. For unknown reasons, the Wrangell carvers depicted the Baranov figure <b>without</b> <b>clothes.</b> Following a Sitka Tribe of Alaska-sponsored removal ceremony, the pole was lowered due to safety concerns on October 20, 2010, using funds from the Alaska Dept. of Health and Social Services. The Sitka Sentinel reported that while standing, it was [...] "said to be the most photographed totem [...] in Alaska". The pole was re-erected in Totem Square in 2011.|$|E
2500|$|The Sliven prisoner-of-war {{camp was}} {{established}} in 1915 {{with the intent of}} housing captured Serbian troops. Starting from 1916, its population was bolstered with Serbian civilians who were held in mixed groups with the military personnel. At its peak 19,000 prisoners were assigned to Sliven, being the biggest P.O.W. camp in Bulgaria. However 1,800 at most resided within the camp, the rest being house near their place of employment. At the same time the camp was transformed into a punitive institution. In July 1917, it began receiving Greek civilians from the occupied Western Thrace region, the Greeks were treated {{the same way as the}} Serbs. A parallel influx of Serbian civilians from Morava necessitated the construction of a lesser camp, numbering 28 barracks. Each barrack held 80 to 100 internees while its intended capacity was 20. The prisoners slept on the floor, it did not contain bed, hay or blankets or windows. The faulty construction meant that water often leaked in. The barrack had no toilets and sanitation and disinfection were rare, prisoners still defecated within them as those who attempted to venture outside the barracks during the night were shot or beaten. The prisoners held there were fed 300 to 800 grams of black bread per day, a pepper soup three times per week and meat once per week. The prisoners grew increasingly hungry eating grass and stealing hay from the cattle. The internees were held <b>without</b> <b>clothes,</b> shoes or underwear. On average only 20 people per barrack survived until the end of the war. Between August and December 1917, 2,709 deaths were recorded of them 1,490 were from malnutrition.|$|E
