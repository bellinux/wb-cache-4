50|$|The Douglas DF was a {{commercial}} flying boat built by Douglas Aircraft Company and which first flew on 24 September 1936. It could accommodate 32 passengers, or 16 in sleeper cabins, {{and was the}} last flying boat built by the company. Despite acceptable handling and performance within design specifications, no commercial orders were forthcoming and faced with no domestic market for aircraft already built, the company obtained export permits for them. The first two production aircraft were sold to Japan, ostensibly for commercial airline use, however {{one of them was}} dismantled, reverse-engineered and formed the basis {{for the development of the}} Kawanishi H8K. The second one was lost on a survey flight in 1938. The second production pair were sold (as DF-195s) to the Soviet Union and after <b>winterizing,</b> were disassembled and transported to Russia via ship, where they were operated as transports by Aeroflot.|$|E

Deodorization step has {{a significant effect on}} all of these quality attributes. Results of this study indicated that, most part of the tocopherols are wasted during deodorizing step. Therefore, oil stability not always in depends on the content of tocopherol, however the proper concentration of nutritionists, industrialists, and manufacturers are also needed for the necessary improvements in processing technology to avoid the major loss of tocopherols and to increase the shelf life, as well as the, nutritive value of processed oil...|$|E
40|$|Welcome to December, a month {{famous for}} family, fri-volity, parties and joyous good times! But the recent cool weather reminds us {{it is time}} to begin <b>winterizing</b> our gardens.

Clear them off the lawn and craft them into comfy blan-kets to keep our beds warm. Then sit back with a cup of hot {{chocolate}} and enjoy all the beautiful fall and winter colors out in the yard.

40|$|FISH PRODUCTION: Final {{shocking}} of eggs {{was finished}} in the incubation. Egg enumeration for the 2008 brood was completed and the eggs are being incubated in 38 degree Fahrenheit chilled water. Don Larsen of NOAA made a request of eggs for research purposes {{and was able to}} acquire supplemental line eggs 10, 555. Estimated density at the time of ponding in Mid-March of 2009 is approximately 43, 869 fry per raceway after calculating an average fry loss of 2 %. The end of the month totals for the 2007 brood reports 773, 807 juveniles on hand with an overall average of 31. 4 fish per pound. Tagging continues on the 2007 brood and is on pace to wrap up in early December. FISH CULTURE: Ponds are cleaned as needed and due to the colder water temperatures, the feeding frequency has been changed to three days a week. All ponds are sampled {{at the end of the}} month. Growth for production fish are adjusted accordingly as temperature dictates feeding levels. Torrential rain on the 12 th turned the Yakima River extremely turbid. Fish tagging operations were halted and the ensuing conditions at the facility intake screens became a concern. Water flow to the wet well became restricted so the decision was made to shut the surface water (river) pumps down and turn on well pumps No. 1, No. 4 and No. 6 to run water to the facility head box. This operation continued for twenty-four hours at which point normal operations were optimal and fish tagging resumed, although the river didn't clear up enough to feed the fish until the 17 th. WATER PRODUCTION: The current combined well and river water supply to the complex is 14, 822 gallons/minute. Well No. 2 is pumping water at a rate of 530 gallons per minute. All four river pumps are in operation and pumping 14, 292 gallons/minute. ACCLIMATION SITES: Cle Elum staff has been working to prep the acclimation sites for the upcoming fish transfer before the snow falls. Thermographs at each site are changed weekly. AMB Tools performed routine maintenance on the compressor and Brown and Jackson pumped out the septic tank at the Jack Creek acclimation site. VEHICLE MAINTENANCE: Snow tires are now on all vehicles and snow blowers were installed on the John Deere tractor and lawn tractor. The snowplow was also installed on the Ford one ton. The four Snowmobiles were serviced by Yamaha Jacks of Ellensburg. MAINTENANCE BUILDING MAINTENANCE: Clean up occurs on Fridays of each week. HATCHERY BUILDING MAINTENANCE: Water has been turned on to vertical incubator islands one and two. After eggs were transferred to vertical stacks cleaning of troughs began. WDFW crew inventoried eggs from isolettes and then transferred them to the vertical incubators. RIVER PUMP STATION MAINTENANCE: All four pumps are in operation and supplying the facility with 14, 292 gallons/minute of water to rearing ponds. WELL FIELD MAINTENANCE: Well pumps No. 1, No. 4 and No. 6 were turned on to supplement water flow to the facility as mentioned previously. Well No. 5 was powered up but a <b>winterizing</b> valve malfunction wouldn't allow operation, we are currently working on it at this time. Well No. 2 is pumping 530 gallons per minute and supplies well water to incubation and chiller. The pumps meter is recorded weekly. Test holes are monitored weekly and results are faxed to CH 2 MHILL afterward. SAFETY AND TRAINING: Ice melt and sand bags are popular items at the facility this month as freezing temperatures cause ground to become slippery and hazardous. GROUNDS: Van Alden's Plumbing installed a new commode in resident house No. 411 and also inspected a plumbing problem at resident No. 1131. Cle Elum staff along with WDFW staff worked to locate the spawning channel building back to the position it was at to have Greg Wallace of Wallace Electric hook electricity back up to the spawning shed. MEETINGS AND TOURS: Charlie attended a policy meeting at Cle Elum on the 18 th. The Internal projects annual review took place at Cle Elum on the 19 th and 20 th. Bill Bosch continues to visit monthly to incorporate data into the YKFP data base. PERSONNEL: IHS employees traveled to Cle Elum to administer flu shots to YN staffers and families as well as WDFW staffers...|$|E

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{characterize}} and compare cold pressed and fully refined <b>winterized</b> corn oils. Free fatty acidity (FFA), peroxide (PV) and p-anisidin (p-AV) values, saponification number, total carotenoid and phenolic contents of cold pressed corn oils were higher than that of the refined <b>winterized</b> corn oils. Linoleic and oleic acids (approximately 53 - 54 % and 30 - 31 %, respectively) were detected as the major fatty acids in both oil samples. Fifteen different sterols with a majority of β-sitosterol, campesterol, and stigmasterol were quantified in both oil samples. Although phenolic compounds were not quantified in the refined <b>winterized</b> oil samples, some flavonoids (hesperidin, rutin) and phenolic acids (gallic, syringic, rosmaniric and trans-ferulic) were detected in the cold pressed oil samples. This study concludes that cold pressed corn oils could be superior in terms of bioactive compounds but still need some quality improvements for sensory attributes...|$|R
