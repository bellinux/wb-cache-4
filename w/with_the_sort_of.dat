500|$|Christian {{elements}} especially—largely sacriligeous—are {{prominent in}} the book. [...] They are at first innocuous and unimportant: a zombie named Christian, another character who believes he has found Christ's face {{on a piece of}} adhesive tape. [...] With the fourth issue of Yummy Fur, Brown's surreal take on Christianity becomes central: the cover depicts the Virgin Mary holding not just the infant Christ, but also a severed hand. [...] Within is the story of Saint Justin, whose amputation becomes a key motif: Chet loses his own hand and finds another; his own appears mysteriously under Ed's pillow. [...] Only by praying for forgiveness for his adultery and by murdering his lover is Chet's hand miraculously restored. [...] According to the Lives of the Saints, the fictional Saint Justin severed his own hand, but in another version Brown presents, Justin's wife cuts it off with a woodaxe when she catches her husband masturbating after rejecting her advances. [...] Despite Saint Justin's story's exposure to the reader as a fraud, Chet's faith in the official version restores his severed hand. [...] The altered ending from 1992 has both Josie and Chet reunited in Hell, and the ghost of Chet's sister becomes a devil. [...] As Brown mixes surreal sacrilege <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> moralism that compels him to condemn Josie for her bloody revenge, Brian Evenson calls Brown [...] "deft at muddying the waters {{in a way that makes}} it very hard to pin him down as either belieever or satirist, as either anti-religionist or apologist".|$|E

Similarly, Tom Hawking of Flavorwire felt that the director's cut ruined the [...] "enduring ambiguity" [...] of the original. Hawking included Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut in his 2010 list of [...] "10 director's cuts that are worse than the original".

In the Total Film book The 100 Greatest Movies of All Time, where the original cut of Donnie Darko was listed at number 87, Jonathan Dean also criticized this loss of ambiguity, remarking: [...] "Unwisely building concrete bypasses over gossamer plot strands, [...] steers us through a spaghetti junction of possible meanings when all we really want to do is get lost." [...] In a 2016 retrospective review, Germain Lussler of io9 stated that the director's cut [...] "simply isn't as good" [...] and [...] "feels less magical".
