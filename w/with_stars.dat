5|$|Grissom's crew {{received}} {{approval in}} June 1966 {{to design a}} mission patch with the name Apollo 1. The design's center depicts a Command/Service Module flying over the southeastern United States with Florida (the launch point) prominent. The Moon {{is seen in the}} distance, symbolic of the eventual program goal. A yellow border carries the mission and astronaut names with another border set <b>with</b> <b>stars</b> and stripes, trimmed in gold. The insignia was designed by the crew, with the artwork done by North American Aviation employee Allen Stevens.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} stages of core-collapse may be divided into three phases. During a globular cluster's adolescence, the process of core-collapse begins <b>with</b> <b>stars</b> near the core. However, the interactions between binary star systems prevents further collapse as the cluster approaches middle age. Finally, the central binaries are either disrupted or ejected, resulting in a tighter concentration at the core.|$|E

50|$|Viva Films made a {{comeback}} by co-producing with new players GMA Films and Star Cinema while producing its own films. Among {{the movies that}} the company co-produced or solely produced were Till I Met You (with GMA Films), Wag Kang Lilingon (<b>with</b> <b>Star</b> Cinema), Ang Cute ng Ina Mo (<b>with</b> <b>Star</b> Cinema), Paano Kita Iibigin (<b>with</b> <b>Star</b> Cinema), Ouija (<b>with</b> GMA Films), Apat Dapat Dapat Apat: Friends 4 Lyf and Death (with On-Q 28 Productions), Ikaw Pa Rin: Bongga Ka Boy, When Love Begins (<b>with</b> <b>Star</b> Cinema), A Very Special Love (<b>with</b> <b>Star</b> Cinema), recently in 2009, Status: Single (with On-Q 28 Productions), You Changed My Life (<b>with</b> <b>Star</b> Cinema), and Patient X (with GMA Films and RGUTZ Productions), and on 2010, Babe, I Love You (<b>with</b> <b>Star</b> Cinema), Working Girls (with GMA Films and Unitel Pictures), Hating Kapatid, In Your Eyes (with GMA Films), and Petrang Kabayo. Patient X marks the first Viva movie of rising young actor Richard Gutierrez followed by In Your Eyes and also the first Viva movie of teen actress Cristine Reyes who can be the next Viva princess after signing a contract with Viva Entertainment, while Working Girls marks the first Viva movie of 1st Starstruck princess Jennylyn Mercado, who can be the next Viva princess, after she {{signed a contract with}} Viva Entertainment.|$|R
5|$|The {{stars that}} {{correspond}} to Grus were generally too far south to be seen from China. In Chinese astronomy, Gamma and Lambda Gruis may {{have been included in}} the tub-shaped asterism Bàijiù, along <b>with</b> <b>stars</b> from Piscis Austrinus. In Central Australia, the Arrernte and Luritja people living on a mission in Hermannsburg viewed the sky as divided between them, east of the Milky Way representing Arrernte camps and west denoting Luritja camps. Alpha and Beta Gruis, along with Fomalhaut, Alpha Pavonis and the stars of Musca, were all claimed by the Arrernte.|$|E
5|$|Writer-director Bertino was {{inspired}} by two real-life events: the Manson family Tate murders, a multiple homicide that occurred in California in 1969; {{and a series of}} break-ins that occurred in his own neighborhood as a child. Made on a budget of $9 million, the film was shot on location in rural South Carolina in the fall of 2006. At the 2007 San Diego Comic Con, Bertino appeared <b>with</b> <b>stars</b> Tyler and Speedman, and premiered a teaser trailer promoting the film.|$|E
5|$|Core-collapse {{is thought}} to occur when the more massive stars in a {{globular}} cluster encounter their less massive companions. Over time, dynamic processes cause individual stars to migrate {{from the center of}} the cluster to the outside. This results in a net loss of kinetic energy from the core region, leading the remaining stars grouped in the core region to occupy a more compact volume. When this gravothermal instability occurs, the central region of the cluster becomes densely crowded <b>with</b> <b>stars</b> and the surface brightness of the cluster forms a power-law cusp. (Note that a core collapse is not the only mechanism that can cause such a luminosity distribution; a massive black hole at the core can also result in a luminosity cusp.) Over a lengthy period of time this leads to a concentration of massive stars near the core, a phenomenon called mass segregation.|$|E

5|$|In 1859 {{a further}} {{edition of the}} Statutes was issued; the changes related mainly to the costs {{associated}} with the Order. Prior to this date it had been the policy that the insignia (which were provided by the Crown) were to be returned on the death of the holder; the exception had been foreigners who had been awarded honorary membership. In addition foreigners had usually been provided <b>with</b> <b>stars</b> made of silver and diamonds, whereas ordinary members had only embroidered stars. The decision was made to award silver stars to all members, and only require the return of the Collar. The Crown had also been paying the fees due to the officers of the Order for members who had been appointed for the services in the recent war. The fees were abolished and replaced with a salary of approximately the same average value. The offices of Genealogist and Messenger were abolished, and those of Registrar and Secretary combined.|$|E
5|$|On January 28, 2010, it was {{reported}} that the distribution rights for the Japanese market were purchased by TBS for a record 400 million yen ($4.2 million USD). The station began airing the Japanese-dubbed version during primetime—a first for a South Korean-produced drama series in the country—on April 21, 2010 with numerous acting talents providing the voiceovers, including Tatsuya Fujiwara as Kim Hyun-jun. The two-hour premiere drew TBS's highest ratings for the day and doubled the station's usual average for the timeslot. The airing had been preceded by a promotional blitz <b>with</b> <b>stars</b> Lee Byung-hun and Kim Tae-hee appearing on numerous Japanese programs, in addition to billboards and posters being placed throughout Tokyo.|$|E
5|$|Q*bert Rebooted {{contains}} a port {{of the classic}} arcade game alongside a new playing mode that uses hexagonal shapes, {{increasing the number of}} possible movement directions to six. Additionally, the 'Rebooted' mode features new enemy types, including a boxing glove that punches Q*bert off the levels and a treasure chest that tries to avoid him. The game has 5 different stage designs spread across 40 levels, which contain three rounds and a bonus round and have to be completed with 5 lives. Gems are collected to unlock different skins for the Q*bert character, and completing levels multiple times while reaching specific time and score goals is awarded <b>with</b> <b>stars</b> that enable access to more levels.|$|E

50|$|In 1998 he was {{appointed}} as a Commander <b>with</b> <b>Star</b> of Finland's Order of the Lion and as a Commander <b>with</b> <b>Star</b> of the Icelandic Order of the Falcon. He received the Luxembourg Order of Merit (Commander) and in 1990 {{he was awarded the}} 1998 Economist Award.|$|R
5|$|Su Song {{also created}} a {{celestial}} atlas (in five separate maps), which had the hour circles between the xiu (lunar mansions) forming the astronomical meridians, <b>with</b> <b>stars</b> marked in an equidistant cylindrical projection {{on each side of}} the equator, and thus, was in accordance to their north polar distances. Furthermore, Su Song must have taken advantage of the astronomical findings of his political rival and contemporary astronomer Shen Kuo. This is so because Su Song's fourth star map places the position of the pole star halfway between Tian shu (−350 degrees) and the current Polaris; this was the more accurate calculation (by 3 degrees) that Shen Kuo had made when he observed the pole star over a period of three months with his width-improved sighting tube. There were many star maps written before Song's book, but the greatest significance of these star maps by Su Song is, that they represent the oldest extant star maps in printed form.|$|E
5|$|The ship, <b>with</b> <b>Stars</b> of David {{painted on}} her funnels, {{pulled away from}} the dock at eight minutes before noon, nearly an hour later than her planned {{departure}} time, and headed to Haifa, with an intermediate stop in Naples. On board were some 400passengers from all over the United States and Canada, most of whom were tourists wanting to see the Holy Land. Many of the passengers, including a contingent from the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, were also sailing in order to attend the dedication of the Hebrew University at Mount Scopus by former British Foreign Secretary Lord Balfour. President Arthur also carried agricultural equipment and trucks to be used for farm development in Palestine. In addition, the liner featured Bernice P. Schmitt and Rebeccca Adelman, who, according to contemporary news reports, were the first ever female officers on an ocean liner.|$|E
5|$|Depending on {{the path}} taken by the player, Jill's final {{encounter}} with Nicholai will differ. In one version of the events, Nicholai will attempt to start a gunfight with Jill, only to be taken by surprise by Nemesis. In another event, Nicholai will hijack Jill's intended escape chopper, and the player must choose to either reason with Nicholai or destroy the helicopter. If Jill negotiates with Nicholai, he reveals that he has killed the other supervisors and boasts about collecting the bounty placed on Jill by Umbrella before escaping. Regardless of Nicholai's fate, Jill makes {{her way to the}} rear yard and confronts Nemesis one last time. After an intense battle, Jill defeats Nemesis {{with the help of a}} prototype railgun before meeting up with Carlos and escaping the city via a helicopter. If the previous escape chopper was stolen by Nicholai, Jill and Carlos will instead meet up <b>with</b> <b>S.T.A.R.S.</b> Alpha Team's weapons specialist Barry Burton, who helps them escape in his own helicopter instead. The final cutscene of the game shows the thermobaric missile strike vaporizing the Raccoon City and its infected populace.|$|E

5|$|Ralston, who {{considered}} the Enterprise ugly {{and the model}} hard to shoot, delighted in destroying the ship. Several shots were combined together for the complete destruction sequence; while Ralston {{would have preferred to}} take a mallet to the original $150,000 model, a variety of cheaper models were used. The first part of the ship to be destroyed was the bridge, a separate miniature <b>with</b> <b>stars</b> added to the background. The shot switches to the Bird of Prey moving away as the top of the saucer burns, where explosions (filmed upside down to simulate the absence of gravity) were superimposed over a motion control pass of the ship. The camera cuts to a closeup of the ship's registration number being eaten away by inner explosions. George created a light Styrofoam model that was dissolved by acetone dripped on the saucer from above. By shooting at less than one frame per second and keeping light off the model, the drips were not visible in the print. Burning steel wool {{on the inside of the}} saucer created a glowing ember effect from the ship's inner decks being destroyed. The saucer explosion was simulated by blowing up a talcum powder-covered plaster dish. Two and fourounce bombs and gasoline were used as pyrotechnics in live action scenes of the bridge being destroyed. Stuntmen used spring-loaded platforms to launch themselves in the air.|$|E
5|$|This {{cosmology}} {{was accepted}} by Isaac Newton, Christiaan Huygens and later scientists. Edmund Halley (1720) and Jean-Philippe de Chéseaux (1744) noted independently that the assumption of an infinite space filled uniformly <b>with</b> <b>stars</b> {{would lead to the}} prediction that the nighttime sky would be as bright as the Sun itself; this became known as Olbers' paradox in the 19th century. Newton believed that an infinite space uniformly filled with matter would cause infinite forces and instabilities causing the matter to be crushed inwards under its own gravity. This instability was clarified in 1902 by the Jeans instability criterion. One solution to these paradoxes is the Charlier Universe, in which the matter is arranged hierarchically (systems of orbiting bodies that are themselves orbiting in a larger system, ad infinitum) in a fractal way such that the Universe has a negligibly small overall density; such a cosmological model had also been proposed earlier in 1761 by Johann Heinrich Lambert. A significant astronomical advance of the 18th century was the realization by Thomas Wright, Immanuel Kant and others of nebulae.|$|E
