During the Long Way Round journey in 2004, McGregor and his travelling companions saw some of UNICEF's work in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Mongolia, and during the Long Way Down trip in 2007, he and Charley Boorman did some work for UNICEF in Africa. McGregor hosted the annual Hollywood gala for the GO Campaign in 2009 and 2010. He {{has worked with the}} Children's Hospice Association Scotland, as featured in Long <b>Way</b> <b>Down.</b> <b>In</b> 2012, he travelled with UNICEF immunization workers to remote parts of India, Nepal and the Republic of Congo for a BBC2 documentary entitled Ewan McGregor: Cold Chain Mission.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, a stone {{meteorite}} was uncovered {{during an}} archaeological dig at Danebury Iron Age hillfort, Danebury England. It was found deposited part <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> an Iron Age pit (c. 1200 BC). Since {{it must have}} been deliberately placed there, this could indicate one of the first (known) human finds of a meteorite in Europe.|$|E

25|$|Montoya {{went into}} the Canadian Grand Prix desperately needing some points, after having had only 6 points from seven races.

He came under pressure from a charging Rubens Barrichello, and pushed his car too hard and retired after crashing into a wall while trying to both fend off Barrichello and catch up with the cars in front.|$|E

2500|$|There is {{disagreement}} {{about the use}} of the term [...] "three point" [...] position.

2500|$|Andrew Conrad of The Baltimore Sun {{gave the}} episode a more mixed review, saying: [...] "My bold {{prediction}} after last week's controversial episode of 'The Walking Dead' {{was that this}} week's would slow things <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> preparation for the grand Season 4 finale next Sunday evening. Well, this week's episode, titled 'Us,' was not exactly slow, but I doubt it will draw the crowds to the water cooler this morning either.

2500|$|Introduced to skiing by his father, he [...] {{invented the}} slalom skiing race in 1922. Mathias Zdarsky {{had been running}} {{competitions}} through poles {{in the early years}} of the 20th century, but they were essentially style competitions, though they had to be completed within a specified time. In 1921 Lunn organized the first British national ski championship to include a national slalom race as well as jumping and cross-country. The 1921 slalom was decided on style, as Zdarsky's pole race had been. By 1922, however, Lunn, convinced that there was a real need for a race designed to test a skier's ability to turn securely and rapidly on steep Alpine ground, was insisting on speed being the only arbiter. [...] "The object of a turn is to get round a given obstacle losing as little speed as possible," [...] he wrote. [...] "Therefore, a fast ugly turn is better than a slow pretty turn." [...] On 1 January 1922, the Alpine Ski Challenge Cup, first held in 1920, was transformed into a challenge cup for slalom racing. On the practice slopes at Mürren, Lunn set pairs of flags through which the competitors had to turn, and the flags were so set as to test the main varieties of Alpine ski turns. Lunn's innovation was that the winner was simply the competitor who could make his <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the shortest time. This first slalom was won by J. A. Joannides.|$|E

2500|$|In 1959 Matthews {{contacted}} Dexter Gordon who was {{prominent in}} the Los Angeles jazz scene at the time. [...] Matthews' first big band was started {{with the help of}} Gordon and fellow saxophonist Curtis Amy. [...] The group started with a book of 21 charts from Matthews, and rehearsed on Wednesday nights for 5 months until they finally booked gigs in the area. [...] The group was a conglomerate of all-star Los Angeles jazz/studio artists who immediately took a liking to playing Matthews' inventive, blues-based orchestrations; the first players coming through his band included Gordon, Amy, Sonny Criss, Jack Sheldon, Carmell Jones, and Red Mitchell. [...] Curtis Amy included two of Matthews' original tunes on his Pacific Jazz LPs Meetin' Here and <b>Way</b> <b>Down</b> <b>in</b> 1961 and 1962 respectively. [...] Dexter Gordon recorded Matthews' original tune [...] "Very Saxily Yours" [...] for his Gettin' Around LP on Blue Note Records, but the track was not released until 25 years later on the CD re-issue. [...] Matthews became known around Los Angeles as an adept arranger and musical director; his first professional arranging assignments came at this time with Lionel Hampton, Della Reese, Ruth Price, and Gene McDaniels. [...] The first tune of Matthews to be commercially recorded was in 1956, when clarinetist Maurice Meunier, who had played with Lionel Hampton, recorded in France. [...] Meunier had got a copy of Matthews' Blues for the Reverend through his association with the Hampton band the year before.|$|E
