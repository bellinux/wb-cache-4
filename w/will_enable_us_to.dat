[...] “New {{technologies}} will change how we live and how we drive our cars, which all will have the beneficial effect of improving the environment,” Bush said. “And in my judgment we need to set aside whether or not greenhouse gases {{have been caused by}} mankind or because of natural effects and focus on the technologies that <b>will</b> <b>enable</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> live better lives {{and at the same time}} protect the environment”. Gore responded that [...] "The entire global scientific community has a consensus on the question that human beings are responsible for global warming and he [...] has today again expressed personal doubt that that is true."

Coghill was pleased to return, believing it right that Tony's story arc should conclude realistically, giving closure to the storyline and continuing to raise awareness of the issue. Santer commented: [...] "One of the unique things about EastEnders is its ability to play stories over months and years. Chris agreeing to come back for these episodes <b>will</b> <b>enable</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> continue showing the long-term consequences of Tony's abuse of Whitney and – I hope – continue to do justice to the issue of child sex abuse." [...] Grounds praised Tony's trial, stating that it demonstrated the importance for children of having their abusers brought to justice. Palmer felt that: [...] "If one person out there who's been abused saw that [...] {{go out of their way}} to make it easier on the victim – Whitney's evidence is given by video link – it will be worth it." ...|$|E

We advocate a clear separation between functional behavior and functional security requirements. We propose a formal language to specify functional security policies.

2500|$|Early {{behavioral}} researchers studied stimulus–response pairings, {{now known}} as classical conditioning. They demonstrated that behaviors could be linked through repeated association with stimuli eliciting pain or pleasure. Ivan Pavlov—known best for inducing dogs to salivate {{in the presence of}} a stimulus previous linked with food—became a leading figure in the Soviet Union and inspired followers to use his methods on humans. In the United States, Edward Lee Thorndike initiated [...] "connectionism" [...] studies by trapping animals in [...] "puzzle boxes" [...] and rewarding them for escaping. Thorndike wrote in 1911: [...] "There can be no moral warrant for studying man's nature unless the study <b>will</b> <b>enable</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> control his acts." [...] From 1910–1913 the American Psychological Association went through a sea change of opinion, away from mentalism and towards [...] "behavioralism", and in 1913 John B. Watson coined the term behaviorism for this school of thought. Watson's famous Little Albert experiment in 1920 demonstrated that repeated use of upsetting loud noises could instill phobias (aversions to other stimuli) in an infant human. Karl Lashley, a close collaborator with Watson, examined biological manifestations of learning in the brain.|$|E

40|$|High {{mortality}} rates {{and lack of}} recruitment in the acacia populations throughout the Negev Desert and the Arava rift valley of Israel {{have been reported in}} previous studies. However, {{it is difficult to determine}} whether these reports can be evidence to a significant decline trend of the trees populations. This is because of the slow dynamic processes of acaia tree populations and the lack of long term continuous monitoring data. We suggest a new data analysis technique that expands the time scope of the field long term monitoring of trees in arid environments. This <b>will</b> <b>enables</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> improve our understanding of the spatial and temporal changes of these populations. We implemented two different approaches in order to expand the time scope of the acacia population field survey: (1) individual based tree change detection using Corona satellite images and (2) spatial analysis of trees population, converting spatial data into temporal data. The next step was to integrate the results of the two analysis techniques (change detection and spatial analysis) with field monitoring. This technique can be implemented to other tree populations in arid environments to help assess the vegetation conditions and dynamics of those ecosystems...|$|R

The study is based on secondary empirical material and on field work done in the Babati district in Tanzania.
