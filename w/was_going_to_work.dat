Three days later, NHA owners—at a meeting that did not include Livingstone—voted to suspend the Blueshirts franchise to keep the number of {{teams in the league}} even. Toronto players were put in a lottery and claimed by other teams, although they were to be returned to Toronto when the franchise was reinstated. On February 13, Livingstone issued a statement that he was through with the NHA and that the Blueshirts franchise was available to the highest bidder.

25|$|Existing {{technology}} {{continued to}} present difficulties: in particular, animating hair {{turned out to}} be a challenge. Senior software engineer Kelly Ward spent six years writing programs to make it move the way they wanted. As late as January 2010, the directors were still not sure if the Rapunzel character's length of hair <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> These problems were finally solved in March: An improved version of a hair simulation program named Dynamic Wires, originally developed for Bolt, was eventually used. To make hair float believably in water, and to surmount other similar challenges, discrete differential geometry was used to produce the desired effects, freeing the animators from executing these specific tasks directly, which would have taken days instead of minutes.|$|E

In an interview with Billboard magazine, Aguilera expressed dissatisfaction with contemporary music, as technology [...] "has advanced itself so anybody can be a singer". Thus, Aguilera took musical inspirations from old-school jazz, blues and soul records performed by her 1920s-1940s idols including Billie Holiday, Otis Redding, Etta James and Ella Fitzgerald, which she viewed as [...] "music that really had heart".|$|E

500|$|The longest {{casting process}} {{was that of}} Bakula as Archer, due to the {{extended}} contract negotiations that took place, which added to a delay in production. He had been sought for the part by the executive producers, although Bakula {{wanted to do the}} show, he [...] "wanted to feel that [...] was making a good deal and that everyone <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> together to make this a good experience." [...] He had signed up for a pilot for CBS called Late Bloomers before agreeing to appear on Enterprise. One of the reasons he agreed to join the cast of Enterprise was that he had previously worked with Kerry McCluggage, one of the co-founders of UPN, on Quantum Leap. Berman later admitted {{that they did not have}} an alternative in mind if Bakula decided to turn down the role.|$|E

Moss first hinted at their romance months prior stating: [...] "I think Rhys is going {{to fall in love}} again. It's a character already in the village. It's quite surprising. It's a character who's been here for a while." [...] The relationship proved popular with viewers; during an interview with Digital Spy, Cooper spoke of her original lack of optimism towards the pairing, stating: [...] "When the relationship first started, we didn't know how they were going to gel and how it <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> because people were such fans of Jacqui and Tony. Some people still ask me if those two are going to get back together, but people are really taken with Rhys and Jacqui." [...] Cooper believes it's her own working relationship with Moss that helps make the pairing a success stating: [...] "It's a nice collaboration and we try to make it funny, emotional, hard-hitting, three-dimensional and as interesting for the audience as possible." [...] She also adopted a [...] "couple name" [...] for the pair titled [...] "Ja-Rhys".|$|E

500|$|In the United Kingdom, Sense and Sensibility was {{released}} on 23 February 1996 in order to [...] "take advantage of the hype from Pride and Prejudice", another popular Austen adaptation recently broadcast. Columbia Tristar's head of UK marketing noted that [...] "if there was any territory this film <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> {{it was in the}} UK." [...] After receiving positive responses at previews, marketing strategies focused on selling it as both a costume drama and as a film attractive to mainstream audiences. Attention was also paid to marketing Sense and Sensibility internationally. Because the entire production cycle had consistently emphasised it as being [...] "bigger" [...] than a normal British period drama literary film, distributors avoided labelling it as [...] "just another English period film." [...] Instead, marketing materials featured quotations from populist newspapers such as the Daily Mail, which compared the film to Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994). It was watched by more than ten million viewers in Europe. Worldwide, the film ultimately grossed $134,582,776, a sum that reflected its commercial success. It had the largest box office gross out of the Austen adaptations of the 1990s.|$|E
500|$|Erica Hahn was {{initially}} {{conceived as a}} minor character, and occasional guest-star rival of Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington). The character first appeared in three episodes of the show's second season, followed by another two episodes of the show's third season. Discussing whether she thought Hahn might become a main character after her season three appearance, Smith has stated that at the time: [...] "I didn't really think it <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> out", joking that [...] "After every time I would hope that they would call and also hope not too– kind of like when I used to be single." [...] However, following Washington's departure from the show, Hahn was brought back as a main character in the show's fourth season, replacing Burke as Seattle Grace's Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery. Smith has {{said that she was}} not expecting her character to be introduced to the show full-time, as she [...] "didn't want to be disappointed if it didn't happen." [...] She has stated that a deciding factor in her return was the opportunity it presented to explore the character in greater depth, explaining: [...] "When I work on something that has a beginning, middle and end, I can create an arc. With Dr. Hahn, I need to figure out who she is". Researching the role, Smith watched a heart surgery performed, and liaised with the surgical nurses employed by Grey's Anatomy producers to maintain realism in the show's operating room. She dubbed this research stressful, stating that [...] "I got very neurotic about the fact that I didn’t go to medical school. I’m not actually a doctor", explaining; [...] "I {{have no idea what it}} really is to be a surgeon and yet I have to act like I am really good at it. I have to look like I’ve been doing it a long time".|$|E
500|$|Following {{several months}} of rumours {{regarding}} the restaurant, the Berkeley Hotel confirmed in May 2008 that it <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with Wareing to launch his only solo restaurant, and he would take on Pétrus' lease from 19 September 2008 onwards. Wareing had previously complained of interference in the kitchen by GRH, and wanted to come out from under Ramsay's shadow, but later {{admitted that he had}} engineered the situation so that he could go out on his own. The split with Ramsay and GRH resulted in a public legal battle and feud between the three parties, which when resolved resulted in Wareing stating in an interview for Waitrose Food Illustrated magazine that Ramsay left him bitter and conflicted; [...] "half of me thinks he’s a sad bastard and the other half still adores him." [...] He went on to describe Ramsay as a celebrity chef who wasn't involved in the industry anymore. The legal dispute was resolved with Ramsay gaining the rights to the Pétrus name, and Wareing signing a gag order regarding the situation but continuing to open his restaurant Marcus Wareing at The Berkeley. Wareing remarked of the situation, [...] "If I never speak to that guy again {{for the rest of my}} life, it wouldn't bother me one bit." [...] Ramsay later responded regarding the feud that he wishes Wareing [...] "all the best". Wareing's self-named restaurant won the Best Restaurant in London Award by Harden's guide in 2008 and 2009, was awarded two Michelin stars in 2009, and was named Time Out's restaurant of the year in 2010. The new Pétrus was opened around the corner from the Berkeley Hotel at 1 Kinnerton Street, Knightsbridge. Ramsay later joked, that with Heston Blumenthal also opening his new restaurant nearby, the three of them could [...] "all have a fight in the street at four in the morning".|$|E

2500|$|A 17-year-old {{architecture}} student visiting Philadelphia in June 1873, Louis Sullivan, closely {{examined a}} house nearing completion at 510 South Broad Street, {{and decided that}} he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> for the firm that designed it. The next day he presented himself to Frank Furness, and {{was hired as a}} draftsman at US$10 a week. The Bloomfield H. Moore House was the most ambitious Furness & Hewitt domestic commission to date, and Furness's interiors – manufacture attributed to Pabst – were his most perverse. The egrets from the Roosevelt dining table reappeared, this time supporting the dining room mantel, but the house is best remembered for the nightmarish chimneypiece in its library. The tall and massive walnut chimneypiece featured compressed columns supporting oversized piers incised with stylized sunflowers, twin [...] "hounds of hell" [...] grotesques snarling from behind shields, a diapered and gold-leafed tympanum bisected by a center column, a crocketed pediment rising to a finial, and twin owls staring down from the roof. The Moore house was demolished in the 1950s, but much of the chimneypiece, stripped of its grotesques and thus about 3 feet (0.91 m) shorter, survives. Sullivan went on to lead the Chicago School of Architecture, and become the mentor to Frank Lloyd Wright.|$|E
