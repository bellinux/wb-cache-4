25|$|The goal {{of local}} helioseismology, a term first used in 1993, is to {{interpret}} the full wave field observed at the surface, not just the mode (more precisely, eigenmode) frequencies. Another <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> is that global helioseismology studies standing waves of the entire Sun and local helioseismology studies propagating waves {{in parts of the}} Sun. A variety of solar phenomena are being studied, including sunspots, plage, supergranulation, giant cell convection, magnetically active region evolution, meridional circulation, and solar rotation. Local helioseismology provides a three-dimensional view of the solar interior, which is important to understand large-scale flows, magnetic structures, and their interactions in the solar interior.|$|E

5000|$|One {{version of}} the design {{thinking}} process has seven stages: define, research, ideate, prototype, choose, implement, and learn. Within these seven steps, problems can be framed, the right questions can be asked, more ideas can be created, and the best answers can be chosen. The steps aren't linear; can occur simultaneously and be repeated. A simpler expression of the process is Robert McKim's phrase [...] "Express-Test-Cycle". An alternative five-phase description of the process is described by Christoph Meinel and Larry Leifer: (re)defining the problem, needfinding and benchmarking, ideating, building, testing.
