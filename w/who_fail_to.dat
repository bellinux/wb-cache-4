5|$|Like other {{forensic}} fields, forensic anthropologists {{are held}} to {{a high level of}} ethical standards due to their work in the legal system. Individuals who purposefully misrepresent themselves or any piece of evidence can be sanctioned, fined, or imprisoned by the appropriate authorities depending on the severity of the violation. Individuals <b>who</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> disclose any conflict of interests or <b>who</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> report all of their findings, regardless of what they may be, can face disciplinary actions. It is important that forensic anthropologists remain impartial during the course of an investigation. Any perceived bias during an investigation could hamper efforts in court to bring the responsible parties to justice.|$|E
5|$|The charges vary {{according}} to the type of vehicle. Motorcycles are free but there are standard charges for cars, two-axle goods vehicles and larger vehicles with more than two axles. Drivers <b>who</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> pay the charge are issued with a penalty charge notice. There are no signs warning of penalty charges.|$|E
5|$|After initial resistance, Gibbs also {{successfully}} pushed {{legislation in}} 2007 to increase penalties for truck drivers <b>who</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> comply with Colorado's law requiring snow chain on roads in winter, a move {{designed to improve}} accessibility and safety on I-70, which bisected Gibbs' house district. In later years, Gibbs and state officials attributed decreases in accidents and tickets issued for violating the chain law {{to the passage of}} the bill. Gibbs was named to the interim Transportation Legislation Review Committee {{at the end of the}} 2007 regular session.|$|E

5|$|Liver {{transplantation}} is {{an effective}} cure for Wilson's disease but is used only in particular scenarios because of the risks and complications associated with the procedure. It is used mainly in people with fulminant liver failure <b>who</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> respond to medical treatment or in those with advanced chronic liver disease. Liver transplantation is avoided in severe neuropsychiatric illness, in which its benefit has not been demonstrated.|$|E
5|$|Sleep {{deprivation}} and cumulative fatigue effects describe how individuals <b>who</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> have an adequate period of sleep (78hours in 24hours) {{or who have}} been awake longer than the conventional 1617hours will suffer sleep deprivation. A sleep deficit accumulates with successive sleep-deprived days, and additional fatigue {{may be caused by}} breaking daily sleep into two shorter periods in place of a single unbroken period of sleep. A sleep deficit is not instantly reduced by one night's sleep; it may take two or three conventional sleep cycles for an individual to return to unimpaired performance.|$|E
5|$|The General and {{his entourage}} arrive {{at the port of}} Mompox. Here they are stopped by police, <b>who</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> {{recognize}} the General. They ask for his passport, but he is unable to produce one. Eventually, the police discover his identity and escort him into the port. The people still believe him to be the President of Gran Colombia and prepare banquets in his honor; but these festivities are wasted on him due to his lack of strength and appetite. After several days, the General {{and his entourage}} set off for Turbaco.|$|E

5|$|The tape at {{the start}} line was made more sturdy, {{consisting}} of three strands instead of one, and in a more distinctive pattern; {{the width of the}} start was also reduced. If a false start is called, two officials (in contact with the starter by radio) will wave fluorescent yellow flags at jockeys. Further up the course, a third official will be positioned so as to arrest those <b>who</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> notice the two initial flags. If necessary, the third official will follow the field in a car to stop them.|$|E
5|$|Another risk to rat owners is Rat-bite fever. This is a {{rare disease}} among domesticated rats and is most often found in rats from large chain pet stores who breed their stock of rats in masses (usually with the {{intention}} of being snake food rather than pets) or from breeders <b>who</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> take good care of their rats. This disease is fairly unnoticeable in the rat, but is characterized by the swelling of the site of the bite or scratch where it was contracted, a fever, vomiting and body aches. It is contracted by being bitten or scratched by an infected rat.|$|E
5|$|Another {{political}} issue surrounding the double burden is {{what sort of}} policies directly or indirectly affect those who do domestic work. Some policies that companies have, such as a lower rate for part-time workers or firing workers when they get pregnant {{can be seen as}} disempowering women. Debate as to whether this is gender segregation continues. On one side, only women get pregnant and there is a disproportionate number of women who do part-time work instead of full-time, suggesting that there should be allowances made for women. However, there is also the argument that similar to men <b>who</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> meet the standards of the company and cannot comply with their contract, women who cannot perform work at the performance expected of them should be given the proportionate number of benefits and given no exceptions over men.|$|E

5|$|Obesity {{can lead}} to social stigmatization and {{disadvantages}} in employment. When compared to their normal weight counterparts, obese workers on average have higher rates of absenteeism from work and take more disability leave, thus increasing costs for employers and decreasing productivity. A study examining Duke University employees found that people with a BMI over 40kg/m2 filed twice as many workers' compensation claims as those whose BMI was 18.5–24.9kg/m2. They also had more than 12times as many lost work days. The most common injuries in this group were due to falls and lifting, thus affecting the lower extremities, wrists or hands, and backs. The Alabama State Employees' Insurance Board approved a controversial plan to charge obese workers $25 a month for health insurance {{that would otherwise be}} free unless they take steps to lose weight and improve their health. These measures started in January 2010 and apply to those state workers whose BMI exceeds 35kg/m2 and <b>who</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> make improvements in their health after one year.|$|E
5|$|There {{are eight}} public and one private {{universities}} in Hong Kong, the oldest being the University of Hong Kong (HKU), established in 1910–1912. The Chinese University of Hong Kong {{was founded in}} 1963 to fulfill {{the need for a}} university with a medium of instruction of Chinese. Competition among students to receive an offer for an undergraduate programme is fierce as the annual number of intakes is limited, especially when some disciplines are offered by select tertiary institutions, like medicine which is provided by merely two medical schools in the territory, the Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine at the University of Hong Kong and the Faculty of Medicine of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. In addition to the public post-secondary institutions there are also a number of private higher institutions which offer higher diplomas and associate degree courses for those <b>who</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> enter a college for a degree study so as to boost their qualification of education, some of whom can have a second chance of getting into a university if they have a good performance in these sub-degree courses.|$|E

25|$|The Singapore Exchange {{started to}} penalize naked short sales with an interim measure in September, 2008. These initial {{penalties}} started at $100 per day. In November, they {{announced plans to}} increase the fines for failing to complete trades. The new penalties would penalize traders <b>who</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> cover their positions, starting at $1,000 per day. There would also be fines for brokerages <b>who</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> use the exchange's buying-in market to cover their positions, starting at $5,000 per day. The Singapore exchange had stated that the failure to deliver shares inherent in naked short sales threatened market orderliness.|$|E
