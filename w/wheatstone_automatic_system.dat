This model is able to represent several ways of human reasoning, structured knowledge, execution strategies of an <b>automatic</b> <b>system</b> and many models presented in different works, such as hierarchical fuzzy controllers, cascade correlation neural networks architecture, decision trees, multilayer perceptrons, etc. Finally, thanks to {{the high level of}} abstraction of MORSE, the <b>automatic</b> <b>systems</b> specified by means of this model, have been classified in terms of their general features. This classification could allow a designer of systems to choose the best model of an <b>automatic</b> <b>system</b> to solve a problem. � 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. I...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we analyse {{mismatched}} {{technical conditions}} {{in training and}} testing phases of speaker recognition and their effect on forensic human and automatic speaker recognition. We use perceptual tests performed by non-experts and compare their performance {{with that of a}} baseline <b>automatic</b> speaker recognition <b>system.</b> The degradation of the accuracy of human recognition in mismatched recording conditions is contrasted with that of the <b>automatic</b> <b>system</b> under similar recording conditions. The conditions considered are of public switched telephone network (PSTN) and global system for mobile communications (GSM) transmission and background noise. The perceptual cues that the human subjects use to perceive differences in voices are studied along with their importance in different conditions. We discuss the possibility of increasing the accuracy of <b>automatic</b> <b>systems</b> using the perceptual cues that remain robust to mismatched conditions. We estimate the strength of evidence for both humans and <b>automatic</b> <b>systems,</b> calculating likelihood ratios using the perceptual scores for humans and the log-likelihood scores for <b>automatic</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} thesis {{deals with}} the <b>automatic</b> <b>system</b> for basic emotional facial expressions recognition from static images. Generally the system is divided into the three independent parts, which are linked together in some way. The first part deals with automatic face detection from color images. In this part they were proposed the face detector based on skin color and the methods for eyes and lips position localization from detected faces using color maps. A {{part of this is}} modified Viola-Jones face detector, which was even experimentally used for eyes detection. The both face detectors were tested on the Georgia Tech Face Database. Another part of the <b>automatic</b> <b>system</b> is features extraction process, which consists of two statistical methods and of one method based on image filtering using set of Gabor’s filters. For purposes of this thesis they were experimentally used some combinations of features extracted using these methods. The last part of the <b>automatic</b> <b>system</b> is mathematical classifier, which is represented by feed-forward neural network. The <b>automatic</b> <b>system</b> is utilized by adding an accurate particular facial features localization using active shape model. The whole <b>automatic</b> <b>system</b> was benchmarked on recognizing of basic emotional facial expressions using the Japanese Female Facial Expression database...|$|R
