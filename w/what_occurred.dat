5|$|Khrushchev also {{proposed}} to restructure Soviet high schools. While {{the high schools}} provided a college preparatory curriculum, in fact few Soviet youths went on to university. Khrushchev wanted to shift the focus of secondary schools to vocational training: students would {{spend much of their}} time at factory jobs or in apprenticeships and only a small part at the schools. In practice, <b>what</b> <b>occurred</b> is that schools developed links with nearby enterprises, and students went to work for only one or two days a week; the factories and other works disliked having to teach, while students and their families complained that they had little choice in what trade to learn.|$|E

By later that day, a hurricane watch was issued {{for the rest of the}} eastern United States to Eastport, Maine. By two hours before Gloria's landfall on Long Island, a hurricane warning was in effect for the same area, after warnings were gradually extended further north. Officials anticipated higher winds and storm surge than <b>what</b> <b>occurred,</b> due to the hurricane weakening as it approached landfall.|$|E

Special Agent Olivia Dunham (Torv) and her partner, Agent Scott (Mark Valley), are together in bed at a motel, where Scott says that he loves her. Dunham receives a call from her boss Charlie Francis (Kirk Acevedo), who tells her to head to the airport. Dunham is added to the interagency task force headed by Phillip Broyles (Lance Reddick).|$|E

The purpose and problem of the study were to compare perceptions held by superintendents, principals, and school board presidents and differences in perceptions within and across roles on <b>what</b> does <b>occur</b> and <b>what</b> should <b>occur</b> on four critical issues in AIDS education for healthy children in K- 12 public schools in Illinois: school responsibility, program development, program delivery and evaluation, and instruction, content, and materials. An author-developed survey instrument containing 65 items on critical issues in AIDS education and 11 items on districts and respondents was sent to 600 randomly selected superintendents, principals, and school board presidents. Two hundred usable responses (33 %) were received. Respondents rated their perceptions of <b>what</b> does <b>occur</b> and <b>what</b> should <b>occur</b> in their districts on two Likert-type scales. The results of this study indicate the following. (1) Superintendents, principals, and school board presidents do not differ significantly in their perceptions of <b>what</b> does <b>occur</b> and <b>what</b> should <b>occur</b> on critical issues in AIDS education for healthy children. (2) Each group perceives a significant difference between <b>what</b> does <b>occur</b> in their school districts and <b>what</b> should <b>occur</b> in AIDS education programs. (3) There are no significant differences in perceptions of <b>what</b> does <b>occur</b> and <b>what</b> should <b>occur</b> on critical issues in AIDS education across the three roles of superintendent, principal, and school board president. (4) There are significant differences in the <b>what</b> should <b>occur</b> responses when analyzed by per pupil expenditure and significant differences between the <b>what</b> does <b>occur</b> and <b>what</b> should <b>occur</b> responses when analyzed by per pupil expenditure, student enrollment, and percentage of students at risk. The study has important implications for: (1) development, planning, implementation, and evaluation of AIDS education programs for healthy children; (2) further research to examine possible discrepancies between <b>what</b> does <b>occur</b> and <b>what</b> should <b>occur</b> in AIDS education programs as perceived by administrators and other education professionals; and (3) educational policy...|$|R
5|$|The Japanese again {{planned to}} bombard Henderson Field with battleships {{in order to}} allow a convoy of {{transport}} ships to deliver the 38th's troops and heavy equipment. In contrast, however, to <b>what</b> <b>occurred</b> on 14 October, this time the U.S. Navy moved to intercept the battleship forces sent by Yamamoto from Truk to shell the airfield. During the ensuing Naval Battle of Guadalcanal from 13–15 November, Allied naval and air forces turned back two Japanese attempts to bombard Henderson Field and almost completely destroyed the transport convoy carrying the remainder of the 38th Division. After this failure to deliver significant additional troops to the island, the Japanese commanders finally conceded defeat in the battle for Guadalcanal and evacuated most of their surviving troops by the first week of February 1943. Building on their success at Guadalcanal and elsewhere, the Allies continued their island-hopping campaign against Japan, culminating in Japan's defeat and the end of World War II.|$|E
5|$|Following this {{defeat and}} the {{defection}} {{of one of}} his sub-units to Drljević, Đurišić was induced to negotiate directly with the leaders of the NDH forces about the further movement of his Chetniks towards Slovenia. However, this {{appears to have been a}} trap, as he was attacked and captured by them on his way to the meeting. According to Tomasevich, exactly <b>what</b> <b>occurred</b> after his capture is not clear, but Baćović, Đurišić, Vasić and Ostojić were subsequently killed, along with some Serbian Orthodox priests and others. According to some sources, on 20 April, Đurišić, Baćović, Vasić and Ostojić were taken to the Stara Gradiška prison, near Jasenovac. The Ustaše gathered them in a field alongside 5,000 other Chetnik prisoners and arranged for Drljević and his followers to select 150 Chetnik officers and non-combatant intellectuals for execution. Đurišić, Baćović, Vasić and Ostojić were amongst those selected. They and the others were loaded onto boats by the Ustaše and taken across the Sava River, never to be seen again. It is reported that they were killed either in the Jasenovac concentration camp itself, or in a marsh in its vicinity. The website of the Jasenovac Memorial Site lists Baćović as having been killed at the camp by the Ustaše in 1945. Both the NDH forces and Drljević had reasons for ensnaring Đurišić. The NDH forces were motivated by the mass terror committed by Đurišić on the Muslim population in Sandžak and southeastern Bosnia while Drljević was opposed to Đurišić's support of a union of Serbia and Montenegro which ran counter to Drljević's separatism.|$|E
5|$|Lines {{had been}} {{hardening}} {{on the matter}} of slavery, and Democrats accused Harrison of being an abolitionist because of his membership, a half century earlier, in the Richmond Humane Society, an anti-slavery group; he had posted a mixed record on the issue while in Congress. On August 20, he gave a speech on the slave question at Carthage, Ohio, and stated that <b>what</b> <b>occurred</b> regarding slavery in a state was that state's business alone. He ignored the question of slavery in the District of Columbia and in the territories, both {{under the jurisdiction of the}} federal government. The general had pledged that his door would always be open to his old soldiers, but others came as well, and he hosted an unending series of guests. This was especially difficult for him on Sundays, when his wife forbade political discussion. The economy continued to be poor in 1840, a fact that the Whigs never ceased to press, arguing that Van Buren had done little, and that Harrison's inauguration was needed to put a stop to the hard times.|$|E
