5|$|At {{the hill}} of Puigpardines, Juigné was being already harassed by 80 armed peasants {{of the local}} somatent–a type of militia–, when the arrival of Sala's, Mas' and Baliart's miquelets {{convinced}} him to withdraw. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> cross back the Fluvià, however, they found the way blocked. Juigné decided then attempting to escape to Olot across the wood of Malatosquera and through the bridge of Sant Roc, but the Catalans anticipated him. Sala divided his miquelets in two groups of 300 men each one, and while Josep Mas de Roda, leading the first one, pursued and attacked the French troops across the wood, he blocked the bridge of Sant Roc ahead the second group.

5|$|At around 7:00a.m. on 9 March 2014, the Mexican Army and Navy pinpointed Moreno González's {{whereabouts}} in Tumbiscatío, Michoacán. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> apprehend him, {{the drug}} lord opened {{fire at the}} security forces before being killed in the fire exchange. Mexico's Procuraduría General de la República (PGR) officially confirmed his identity through DNA examinations and fingerprint identification. The results were consistent with law enforcement files. While investigators conducted the autopsy {{at a hospital in}} Apatzingán, more than 150 law enforcement officers from the Army, Navy, Federal Police, and the PGR cordoned the area to prevent organized crime members from attempting to steal his body. Post-mortem reports indicated that Moreno González died of two gunshot wounds on his thorax. On 12 March 2014, his corpse was transferred to Morelia under tight security for further testing. At the time of his death, the drug lord was wanted by the Mexican government for charges relating to drug trafficking, organized crime, kidnapping, murder, and theft.|$|E

5|$|In July 1969, the {{prominent}} Luo politician Mboya was assassinated by a Kikuyu, with suspicions being voiced that Kenyatta's government had been responsible. The killing sparked riots in Nairobi, and ethnic tensions were stoked across Kenya. In October 1969, Kenyatta visited Kisumu, located in Luo territory, {{in order to}} open a hospital financed with Soviet aid. He was greeted by a crowd shouting KPU slogans and he lost his temper. When members of the crowd started throwing stones, Kenyatta's bodyguards opened fire on them, killing and wounding several. In response {{to the rise of}} KPU, Kenyatta had introduced oathing, a system in which individuals came to Gatundu to swear their loyalty to him. Journalists were discouraged from reporting on the oathing system, and several were deported <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> do so. Many were pressured or forced to conduct the oaths, generating a condemnation from the country's Christian establishment. In response to the growing condemnation, the oathing was terminated in September 1969, and Kenyatta invited leaders from other ethnic groups to a meeting in Gatundi.|$|E
5|$|Next, a small {{metallic}} dingy, {{known as}} an iron yawl, was carried down to the beach. Tom Fagen and Freed Waterhouse manned the yawl, in another attempt to reach the grounded schooner. Through skilled seamanship, they {{made it to the}} second set of breakers, only a short distance from the vessel. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> reach the float line, a large wave struck them leaving their boat filled with water. The two men abandoned their yawl. Fagen managed to swim ashore and was met by volunteers close to the beach half-drowned. Waterhouse decided against swimming to shore. When he saw that the yawl had flipped, he swam back to it and straddled the hull. The men on the shore began pulling the flipped boat in, but another wave broke on top of it throwing Waterhouse into the water and righting the yawl. Waterhouse climbed back into the boat and began getting pulled in again, only to be capsized shortly thereafter. This time Waterhouse surfaced, appearing dazed and grasping onto an oar. Shaw's rescue boat was put back in the water, but Waterhouse had already gone under and presumably drowned to death a short time later. F Waterhouse's body was never recovered, despite several searches.|$|E
