Some bean dips incorporate several bean varieties into the dish, such as three-bean dip. Raw beans that are soaked and cooked are used, as are prepared canned beans and refried beans. The use of canned beans {{can result in a}} creamier dip, because beans prepared in canneries are pressure cooked in the can. Canned beans may have a salty flavor, which can be reduced by rinsing and then draining them. Fresh cooked beans may contribute to a more flavorful dish compared to using canned beans.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to find innovative approaches for the production of iron fortified noodles that are natural and economically feasible. The functional food was produced using different combinations. The investigated variables were the ratio of sorghum to <b>white</b> <b>bean</b> flour, pre-gelatinized flours (drum dried or extruded) and guar gum addition while the emulsifier added was kept constant. Investigated parameters were the iron content and its bioavailability, as well as the functional properties (cooking weight, cooking time, cooking loss and texture) of the noodles. Results of the study showed that the content of <b>white</b> <b>bean</b> in the noodles had a direct influence on the iron content and bioavailability. As expected, the iron content and bioavailability was higher the higher the amount of <b>white</b> <b>bean</b> added. Additionally, the iron content and bioavailability was affected by the addition of guar gum and the pregelatinised flours. Iron content of noodles decreased with the increase of guar gum content while the addition of <b>white</b> <b>bean</b> pregelatinised flour showed an increase in the iron content and bioavailability. On examination of the functional properties, the 50 % <b>white</b> <b>bean</b> noodles gave the best results in terms of texture, cooking loss, cooking time and cooking weight. Cooking time, cooking weight and cooking loss were comparable to that of durum wheat noodles. Noodles prepared with 50 % <b>white</b> <b>bean</b> flour and pregelatinized flours (extruded or drum dried) received the best rankings in the sensory evaluation. The result of this study showed that the higher the amount of <b>white</b> <b>bean</b> added, the superior was the noodle quality, therefore fulfilling the requirements of the objectives i. e. good quality noodles with high iron content and bioavailability.

Pendimethalin PPI caused minimal injury in most market classes of dry bean at 1 and 2 WAE. There was no injury in various market classes of dry bean with the low dose at 1 and 2 weeks after emergence (WAE). However, at the high dose there was 0 to 4 % injury at 1 WAE and 0 to 7 % injury at 2 WAE in black, cranberry, kidney, otebo, pink, pinto, SRM and <b>white</b> <b>bean.</b> Pendimethalin PPI was more injurious in <b>white</b> <b>bean</b> than in black, cranberry, kidney, otebo, pink, pinto and SRM bean.

25|$|The magistrates {{were people}} who {{occupied}} a public post and formed {{the administration of the}} Athenian state. They were submitted to rigorous public control.

This was a way of eliminating the personal influence of rich people and possible intrigues and use of favors. There were only two categories of posts not chosen by lot, but by election in the Popular Assembly. These were strategos, or general, and magistrate of finance. It was generally supposed that significant qualities were needed to exercise each of those two offices. A magistrate's post did not last more than a year, including that of the strategoi and in this sense the continued selection of Pericles year after year was an exception. At the end of every year, a magistrate would have to give an account of his administration and use of public finances.|$|E

Result of planting date and weed competition interaction effects indicated that the weed competition decreased grain yield (53 %) in third planting date more than others and delay in planting date was companion with increasing weed density and dry weight in flowering stage of bean.

This experiment was carried out to investigate paclobutrazol (0, 25 and 50 mg/L) effects on reduction of injuries caused by low temperature (5 Â± 1 ÂºC) stress in two cultivars of Phaseolus vulgaris [Daneshkadeh cv.

The results showed that low temperature stress, reduced fresh weight and dry matter and also reduced length of shoots and roots and leaf chlorophyll contents but increased electrolyte leakage percentage. Paclobutrazol treatment reduced fresh weight and dry matter and length of shoots but increased root dry weight and root development. Moreover, paclobutrazol-treated plants, when exposed to the cold stress condition, showed electrolyte leakage percentage less than control plants. Treatment of seedlings with paclobutrazol led {{to an increase in}} chlorophyll contents, either in stress or non stress conditions. <b>White</b> <b>bean</b> was more sensitive to cold than red bean and paclobutrazol affected <b>white</b> <b>bean</b> more than red bean.

2500|$|The cuisine of the Jews of {{the city}} was a variant of the Judeo-Spanish cuisine, which is itself {{influenced}} by the large ensemble of Mediterranean cuisine. It was influenced by the Jewish dietary rules of kashrut, which include prohibitions on the consumption of pork and mixtures of dairy and meat products, and religious holidays that require the preparation of special dishes. However, its key feature was its Iberian influence. Fish, abundant in this port city, was consumed in large quantities and in all forms: fried, baked ("al orno"), marinated or braised ("abafado"), and was often accompanied by complex sauces. Seen as a symbol of fertility, fish was used in a marriage rite called dia del peche ("day of fish") {{on the last day of}} wedding ceremonies, in which the bride stepped over a large dish of fish that was then consumed by the guests. Vegetables accompanied all the dishes, especially onions; garlic was on hand but was not used, since the Ashkenazic synagogues were major consumers of garlic and had been given the nickname [...] "El kal del ajo," [...] "the garlic synagogue." [...] Greek yogurt, widely consumed in the Balkans and Anatolia, was also highly appreciated, as well as cream. In anticipation of Shabbat, hamin was prepared. A Judeo-Spanish variant of the Ashkenazi cholent and the North African dafina, chamin was a meat stew with vegetables (wheat, chickpeas, <b>white</b> <b>beans)</b> that were let simmer until the Saturday midday meal. In preparation for Passover, housewives filled locked chests with sweets, figs and dates stuffed with almonds, marzipan and the popular chape blanche (white jam), which consisted of sugar water and lemon. Wine was reserved for religious rituals, but Sephardim, like their Greek and Muslim neighbors, were major consumers of raki. They also favored sugary drinks made of prune, cherry and apricot syrup, which they drank at the end of the large festive meal.|$|E

At 1 week after emergence (WAE), sulfentrazone alone or in combination with imazethapyr at all doses evaluated caused no significant visible injury in dry bean. At 2 WAE, sulfentrazone alone caused 1 – 11, 1 – 11, 1 – 5, and 3 – 19 % visible injury, and sulfentrazone + imazethapyr caused 3 – 11, 2 – 10, 2 – 5, and 4 – 20 % visible injury in black, cranberry, kidney, and <b>white</b> <b>bean,</b> respectively. At 4 WAE, sulfentrazone alone caused 1 – 7, 1 – 7, 0 – 4, and 1 – 16 % visible injury and sulfentrazone + imazethapyr caused 1 – 8, 1 – 5, 1 – 3, and 2 – 14 % visible injury in black, cranberry, kidney, and <b>white</b> <b>bean,</b> respectively.
