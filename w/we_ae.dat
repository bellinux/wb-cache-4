40|$|Many {{properties}} of nest algebras are actually valid for reflexive operator algebras with a commutative subspace lattice. In this paper we collect {{a number of}} such results related to the carrier space of the algebra. Included among these results are a generalization of Ringrose's criterion, {{a description of the}} partial correspondence between lattice homomorphisms of the carrier space and projections in the lattice, the construction of isometric representations of certain quotient algebras, and a direct sum decomposition of the commutant of the core modulo the intersection of the spectral ideals. Let J ^ = Alg ^ where i f is a commutative subspace lattice and let ^ be the intersection of all the spectral ideals in Jzf. (See § 1 for definitions.) In § 1 we generalize Ringrose's criterion to the commutative subspace lattice case: A e ^ if, and only if, for each e> 0 there is a finite family Et of mutually orthogonal intervals from & such that Σ ^ = l and <b>WE.</b> <b>AE.</b> W < ε, i = 1,., n. We also prove that ^ is the closed linear span of commutators of the form AL — LA, where A e j y and L e £f. In § 2 we describe the partial correspondence between certain projections in Sf and certain lattice homomorphisms in the carrier space X. A necessary (but not sufficient) condition for an operator A to be in the radical of * / is given in § 3. In § 4 we exhibit isometric representations as algebras of operators acting on Hubert space of each quotient algebra J^fjj^ φ and of the quotient *S...|$|E
