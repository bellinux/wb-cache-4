50|$|Toyin’s mum {{played a}} huge {{role in shaping}} her daughter’s pathway; {{from the age of}} 17 to her mid 20s, she {{introduced}} Toyin to a number of dealers in fabric and hair products all across the middle east and Central Asia where she mastered the art of hair processing, colouring, hair treatment, and <b>wefting.</b> Many years of hard work and perseverance has earned Toyin Lawani, a business empire-Tiannahs place empire, which consists of over 20 divisions -Tiannah Spa (Spa Treatments), Tiannah’s Dance Studio(choreography), Tiannnahstyling Music Video (Shoots, Directs and Styles Videos), Tiannah’s Glow (Cream and Consultation), Tiannah’s Hair Goddess, Barbing Saloon, Nail Studio, Tiannahstyling (style outfits, Elegante Boutique, Fashion Academy, Elegante by Tiannahstyling, Elegante Kids, Amala Dot.Com, Tiannah’s Travel and tour, Tiannah’s Make up Studio, Tiannahs Photography, Tattoo Parlour, Tiannahs Home&Furniture Company and more.Furthermore her humanitarian side is seeing Toyin Lawani manage a Charity Organisation called I Rep For Hope, two of the beneficiaries (living with impairments) of the said charity are Mercilin (trained in the skill of Hair Making) and Gladys (trained in the skill of Tailoring). Gladys has sewn some of the most creative outfits for celebrities.|$|E
40|$|In the prefatory {{material}} to the First Folio (1623), Ben Jonson praised Shakespeare with a phrase too fitting to be fitting. Shakespeare’s lines, he wrote, were ‘richly spun, and woven so fit’ (49). This makes Shakespeare into, or out to be, a labourer warping and <b>wefting</b> in a tapestry workshop – a description perhaps too artisanal and banal for an encomium (of sorts). Jonson moves over his own verse line {{to arrive at a}} more evocative criticism: that Shakespeare writes a ‘living line’ (59), transforming ‘spun’ from the tedious routines of a weaver into the alacritous activity of a spider or bug. The textile Shakespeare, weaving ‘so fit’, becomes a textual Shakespeare. Jonson’s line even picks up a thread from Shakespeare’s, since in Henry VIII, or All is True (1613) the Cardinal Wolsey thrives in ‘his self-drawing web’ (1. 1. 63), forever creating the contours of his own power and abundance, at once an act of imaginative range and limitation...|$|E
50|$|<b>Weft</b> {{patterns}} are popularly {{referred to as}} Sapma continuous <b>weft</b> patterns and Tigma discontinuous <b>weft</b> patterns in Bhutan.The continuous <b>weft</b> {{patterns are}} very similar to those featured in other textile throughout South and Southeast Asia. The <b>weft</b> yarn is inserted between intervals of the warp yarn to create continuous <b>weft</b> patterns.The discontinuous <b>weft</b> patterns motifs resemble embroidery are indigenous to Bhutan. Colored pattern yarns are knotted individually to the <b>weft</b> yarns to create geometric motifs which are usually combination of multiple pattern motifs.|$|R

5000|$|Orijime gasuri. <b>Weft</b> yarns are woven on a warp {{of thick}} cotton yarn. The <b>weft</b> is beaten hard, which packs the <b>weft</b> tightly. When the cloth is dyed, {{much of the}} <b>weft</b> is {{protected}} from the dye by the heavy warp. The <b>wefts</b> are then woven with new (normal diameter) warps, resulting in a fine dotted pattern. The silk kasuri of Amami Oshima and the ramie kasuri of Miyakojima, Okinawa are noted for this technique.|$|R

50|$|In <b>weft</b> ikat it is {{the weaving}} or <b>weft</b> yarn that carries the dyed patterns.
