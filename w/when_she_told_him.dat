5|$|Morgan {{had waited}} until her {{academic}} rank was secure before becoming pregnant. She {{had a son}} in 1923, {{the same year that}} she became a full professor. Colleagues were surprised when she had the baby, as she had not mentioned being pregnant and she hid the physical evidence of her pregnancy with her long laboratory jacket. Morgan remembered the reaction of one male colleague <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> the news; he said if she had five children like he did, she would have hardly noticed the new baby. Morgan's mother moved in with her and cared for the baby so that Morgan could work uninterrupted.|$|E
5|$|Doc Holliday {{himself had}} a duel in a saloon in Las Vegas, New Mexico. One {{of the women}} who worked there had an ex-boyfriend named Mike Gordon who had just been {{discharged}} from the Army. Gordon wanted her to stop working. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> to leave her alone, he became angry, went outside the saloon, and started shooting out the windows with his pistol. As bullets went through the saloon, Doc unflinching, holstered his Colt Peacemaker revolver, and walked outside. Gordon then started shooting at him but missed. Holliday then drew his pistol and shot Gordon at long range with one shot. He then went back to the saloon. Gordon died the next day and Holliday fled. Doc Holliday has also been credited with wounding and shooting a pistol out of saloon owner Milt Joyce's hand when he tried to brandish it at Holliday.|$|E

25|$|Few of the {{characters}} in the film, besides John and Alicia Nash, correspond directly to actual people. The discussion of the Nash equilibrium was criticized as over-simplified. In the film, Nash suffers schizophrenic hallucinations while he is in graduate school, but in his life he did not have this experience until some years later. No mention is made of Nash's homosexual experiences at RAND, which are noted in the biography; though both Nash and his wife deny this occurred. Nash fathered a son, John David Stier (born June 19, 1953), by Eleanor Agnes Stier (1921–2005), a nurse whom he abandoned <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> of her pregnancy. The film did not include Alicia's divorce of John in 1963. It was not until after Nash won the Nobel Memorial Prize in 1994 that they renewed their relationship. Beginning in 1970, Alicia allowed him to live with her as a boarder. They remarried in 2001.|$|E
25|$|In {{the present}} {{universe}} of Camelot, King Arthur showed David the broken Excalibur after reading books {{on how to}} make it whole, and when he asked David to help him find the other half, David realized where the portion of the dagger came from. As for the dagger itself Emma is being drawn to it with each passing day, but is repelled by a protection spell put in place by Regina. The manifestation of Rumplestiltskin continues to consume Emma's mind to the point of Emma nearly hurting Hook. The effects are starting a toll on Emma, prompting an intervention from Hook, Henry, Mary Margaret, David, and Regina, but before they {{can come up with a}} solution, Mary Margaret asks David for a moment alone to talk to her husband, and as expected, was to tell him about King Arthur. However, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> about Lancelot being alive and the message he gave her, David ended up defending Arthur, believing that he is being very trustworthy. Mary Margaret on the other hand, believes David has become friends with Arthur because he misses the life he enjoyed back in the Enchanted Forest and that fulfilling it as a Knight in the Round Table will make him important again.|$|E

[...] Her story Yasmina, about a young Bedouin woman who {{falls in love with a}} French officer and the [...] "tragedy this impossible love brings into her life", was published in a local French newspaper. Her mother, who had been suffering from heart problems, died in November 1897 of a heart attack, and was buried under the name of Fatma Mannoubia. Eberhardt was grief-stricken. Trophimowsky, who had been summoned when his partner's health had deteriorated but arrived after her death, showed no sympathy towards Eberhardt. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> she desperately wanted to die and rejoin her mother, he responded by calmly offering her his revolver, which she declined.|$|E
500|$|After Myers had {{completed}} providing the {{voice for the}} character, when the film was well into production, he asked to re-record all of his lines with a Scottish accent, similar to that his mother used <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> bedtime stories and also used for his roles in other films, such as So I Married an Axe Murderer and [...] According to the DVD commentary, he had also tried using country and Canadian accents. After hearing the alternative, Katzenberg agreed to redo scenes in the film, saying, [...] "It was so good we took $4m worth of animation out and did it again." [...] A point Myers disputes, saying [...] "it didn’t cost the studio “millions of dollars,” as rumored. “What it meant is instead of me going in for ten sessions, I went in for twenty sessions. I got paid the same.". [...] Because of Myers voicing the character, more ideas began to come. There were clearer story points, fresher gags and comedy bits. [...] "I {{got a letter from}} Spielberg thanking me so much for caring about the character," [...] Myers said. [...] "And he said the Scottish accent had improved the movie." ...|$|E
500|$|Presley and his wife, meanwhile, {{had become}} {{increasingly}} distant, barely cohabiting. In 1971, an affair {{he had with}} Joyce Bova resulted—unbeknownst to him—in her pregnancy and an abortion. He often {{raised the possibility of}} her moving into Graceland, saying that he was likely to leave Priscilla. The Presleys separated on February 23, 1972, after Priscilla disclosed her relationship with Mike Stone, a karate instructor Presley had recommended to her. Priscilla relates that <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> Presley [...] "grabbed... and forcefully made love to" [...] her, declaring, [...] "This is how a real man makes love to his woman." [...] Five months later, Presley's new girlfriend, Linda Thompson, a songwriter and one-time Memphis beauty queen, moved in with him. Presley and his wife filed for divorce on August 18. Presley became depressed after the break up of his marriage. According to Joe Moscheo of the Imperials, the failure of Presley's marriage [...] "was a blow from which he never recovered." [...] During a press conference in 1972, a reporter asked Presley {{whether or not he was}} satisfied with his image, Presley replied [...] "Well, the human being is one thing. The image is another.

He never now dined or spent his evenings at Greshamsbury, and seldom was to be seen at the house, except when called in professionally.

6000|$|Then Mishcha <b>told</b> <b>him</b> what {{he should}} do. And Nod listened, shivering, in part for the cold, and in part for dread {{of what she was}} saying.

60|$|<b>When</b> <b>she</b> had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> this, Nasmyth sat thoughtfully silent {{a minute}} or two. Her courage and hatred of {{injustice}} had stirred him deeply, for he knew what it must have cost her to discuss the subject of her father's wrongdoing with him. He was also once more overwhelmingly sorry for her. There was nobody she could turn to for support or sympathy, and {{it was evident that}} if he succeeded in foiling Hames, it would alienate her from her father. Waynefleet, he felt, was not likely to forgive her for the efforts she had made to save him from being drawn into an act of profitable treachery.|$|R
2500|$|In 1887, prematurely {{gray and}} badly ailing, Holliday {{made his way}} to the Hotel Glenwood, near the hot springs of Glenwood Springs, Colorado. [...] He hoped to take {{advantage}} of the reputed curative power of the waters, but the sulfurous fumes from the spring may have done his lungs more harm than good. As he lay dying, Holliday is reported to have asked the nurse attending him for a shot of whiskey. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> no, he looked at his bootless feet, amused. The nurses said that his last words were, [...] "This is funny." [...] He always figured he would be killed someday with his boots on. Holliday died at 10am on November 8, 1887. He was 36. [...] Wyatt Earp did not learn of Holliday's death until two months afterward. Horony later said that she attended to him in his final days, and one contemporary source appears to back her claim.|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{before saying}} their [...] "I do's" [...] Erica finds out {{she has a}} {{daughter}} she conceived from rape {{at the age of}} fourteen, Kendall Hart. Erica tells Dimitri what happened all those years ago. This is the first time she told anyone besides Eric Kane and she is grateful he does not say she deserved it like her father did <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him.</b> They bring Kendall into their home as a part of their family. Despite this, Kendall hates her mother for putting her up for adoption and also becomes infatuated with Dimitri. She attempts to sabotage their wedding by burning Dimitri and Angelique's divorce papers. Dimitri's divorce still goes through and his wedding to Erica goes off without a hitch. The young woman wants to find her biological father which Erica is dead set against. Dimitri tries to help Kendall in her search, putting a strain on his marriage. Things heighten even further when Kendall makes sexual advances toward her stepfather and is turned down. Devastated and humiliated, she goes to her mother and lies that Dimitri raped her. Suffering from hallucinations of her own rape, Erica stabs her husband with a letter opener. Dimitri divorces Erica and wants her in prison for what she did but also admits he still loves her.|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the course}} of eight days {{stranded}} in the desert, while the narrator attempts to repair his plane, the little prince recounts {{the story of his}} life, an account that is often triggered by his preoccupation with the sheep. The prince begins by describing life on his tiny home planet: in effect, an asteroid the size of a house (the asteroid was [...] "named" [...] B-612 by people on Earth, but the Prince called it [...] "asteroid 325"; a real asteroid was named after the fictional asteroid). The asteroid's most prominent features are three minuscule volcanoes (two active, and one dormant or extinct) as well as a variety of plants. The prince describes spending his earlier days cleaning the volcanoes and weeding unwanted seeds and sprigs that infest his planet's soil; in particular, pulling out baobab trees that are constantly on the verge of overrunning the surface. [...] "Catastrophe" [...] the little prince would call it. The prince wants a sheep to eat the undesirable plants, but is warned by the narrator that a sheep might also eat roses with thorns. Upon hearing this, the prince tells of his love for a mysterious rose that began growing on the asteroid's surface some time ago. The prince says he nourished the rose and listened to her <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> to make a screen or glass globe to protect her from the cold wind. Although the prince {{fell in love with the}} rose, he also began to feel that she was taking advantage of him, and he resolved to leave the planet to explore the rest of the universe. Although the rose finally apologized for her vanity and the two reconciled, she encouraged him to go ahead with his journey. The prince misses his rose and claims that he only needs to look at the millions of stars to be reminded of his rose, since his rose is on one of them.|$|E

Lilly and Miley hatch a plan to get Oliver back but only to find out that he was practicing saying [...] "I love you" [...] so he could say it to Lilly. They both say that they love each other in the end of the episode. (It is mentioned in this episode that neither Oliver nor Miley have romantic feelings for each other). However, Oliver did used to have romantic feelings towards Hannah Montana before he knew she was Miley. Miley,at first, didn't want to tell him who she was, just in case he had romantic feelings for her as Miley, but <b>when</b> <b>she</b> eventually <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> he saw her as just a friend.|$|R
60|$|Gilbert came {{occasionally}} on Friday evenings. He seemed {{always in}} good spirits, {{and held his}} own in the jests and repartee that flew about. He neither sought nor avoided Anne. When circumstances brought them in contact he talked to her pleasantly and courteously, as to any newly-made acquaintance. The old camaraderie was gone entirely. Anne felt it keenly; but <b>she</b> <b>told</b> herself <b>she</b> was very glad and thankful that Gilbert had got so completely over his disappointment in regard to her. She had really been afraid, that April evening in the orchard, that she had hurt him terribly and that the wound would be long in healing. Now she saw that she need not have worried. Men have died and the worms have eaten them but not for love. Gilbert evidently was in no danger of immediate dissolution. He was enjoying life, and {{he was full of}} ambition and zest. For him there was to be no wasting in despair because a woman was fair and cold. Anne, as she listened to the ceaseless badinage that went on between him and Phil, wondered if she had only imagined that look in his eyes <b>when</b> <b>she</b> had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>she</b> could never care for him.|$|R
60|$|Then Amy {{brought out}} a little book with the early Bible history in pictures. She showed Edwin one every day <b>when</b> <b>she</b> came, and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> about it {{whenever}} {{he did not know}} the story before, or helped him to enter a little more into it. She was surprised sometimes to find that he had carried notions away from school even <b>when</b> <b>she</b> had thought him only dull and giddy. Then he was pleased to say over the hymns he had learnt in the infant school, and to talk a little about it. Amy was quite surprised to find how his mind had grown since he had been ill, and how pleased he was to be taught a little verse of prayer to say when he was in pain.|$|R

They're so flashy and they want crowns, rhinestones, diamonds, and bright outfits. The flashiness and competitiveness reminds me of rap. A lot of people heard [...] "Murda Bizness" [...] {{and thought it was}} about killing people, trying to be tough and hardcore. If you actually listen to the lyrics, it's kind of silly and playful. It's about being in the club, being a bad bitch." [...] The director said, [...] "I think that people are drawing parallels between the title of the song and the business the girls are in.

The peasant did so, and the king gave him the foal but got from him that the queen had given him the advice. He sent the queen back to her father, saying she could take only one thing, what she valued most, from the castle. The queen gave him a sleeping draught and took him back to her father's house. <b>When</b> he woke, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that he was what she valued most in the castle; he took her back with him to the castle and once again recognized her as his wife.|$|R
