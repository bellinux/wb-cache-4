5|$|After these preparations, {{the premier}} called a provincial {{election}} for June 29, 1937. Macdonald campaigned on his government's record. On election day, his Liberals <b>were</b> <b>rewarded</b> with 25 of the 30 {{seats in the}} legislature.|$|E
5|$|Harvey's {{performances}} <b>were</b> <b>rewarded</b> with {{selection for}} an Australian XI in a tour match against the England cricket {{team at the}} start of the 1954–55 season. However, the match was curtailed by rain and Harvey was not able to exhibit his talents on a sticky wicket highly difficult for batting. Listed at No. 4, Harvey came in after the dismissal of his brother and made seven in his only innings. As a result, Ray was not chosen for the Test team alongside his brother during the season.|$|E
5|$|In June 1918, Tucker {{joined the}} escorts {{working out of}} Brest, France. On 1 August, while {{steaming}} out to meet an inbound convoy, she received word that the group's escort, the , had been torpedoed and sunk by a German submarine. The American destroyer soon {{arrived on the scene}} and helped to save the survivors of the stricken French warship from the waters of the Bay of Biscay. Tuckers efforts, and those of the five other American destroyers who were also present, <b>were</b> <b>rewarded</b> by a commendation from the Préfet Maritime, on behalf of the French Ministry of Marine.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{develop a}} theory in which {{consistency}} of ranks on position and ability affect individual satisfaction and system stability. The mechanism <b>is</b> <b>rewards</b> associated with different patterns. For instance, when position <b>is</b> <b>rewarded</b> more than ability, a low ability individual {{with a high}} position will be satisfied; when position and ability <b>are</b> <b>rewarded</b> equally, then rank consistency will be most satisfactory...|$|R
50|$|The {{problem may}} not be that talent and skill <b>are</b> <b>rewarded,</b> but that the <b>rewards</b> <b>are</b> based on {{relative}} talent and skill. If only the top 20% of a game's players <b>are</b> <b>rewarded,</b> 80% must <b>be</b> receiving little <b>reward,</b> even if objectively they are highly talented. If {{there is no hope}} in the future of these players being rewarded, they will likely leave the game, causing the population to shrink, and thus reducing {{the number of people who}} can be in the top 20%. Grinding has the benefit that, although only 20% of the population may <b>be</b> <b>rewarded</b> at any given time, 100% of the population will have the potential to <b>be</b> <b>rewarded</b> in the future, and will have no reason to quit.|$|R
5|$|In {{organizing}} a 1952 exhibition of abstract art, Marcus lured local leaders {{to the show}} by two means. First, he solicited the donation of art from the collections of David Rockefeller and his brothers, along with those from other noted national business leaders. Second, he requested that the donors personally write letters of invitation to their Dallas colleagues, feeling that the otherwise suspect art would benefit from the imprimatur of respected figures known for their fine taste. His efforts <b>were</b> <b>rewarded</b> by a numerous and appreciative turnout for the show.|$|E
5|$|McKinley campaigned widely for Republicans in the 1894 midterm congressional elections; many party {{candidates}} in districts where he spoke were successful. His political efforts in Ohio <b>were</b> <b>rewarded</b> {{with the election}} in November 1895 of a Republican successor as governor, Asa Bushnell, and a Republican legislature that elected Foraker to the Senate. McKinley supported Foraker for Senate and Bushnell (who was of Foraker's faction) for governor; in return, the new senator-elect agreed to back McKinley's presidential ambitions. With party peace in Ohio assured, McKinley turned to the national arena.|$|E
5|$|Pearlman's and Steve Schenk's {{managerial}} efforts <b>were</b> <b>rewarded</b> when Blue Öyster Cult {{were hired}} for some gigs in Greece in July 1987. After a nine-month layoff, the band returned to activity and Allen Lanier re-joined. The European shows were a success, and the reformed line-up of Bloom, Roeser, Lanier, Jon Rogers and drummer Ron Riddle {{worked very well}} together on stage. Blue Öyster Cult returned to the road in 1987 and 1988 with renewed enthusiasm, but without a new album to promote, until the release of Imaginos.|$|E

5|$|The Crusaders {{achieved}} {{more success}} in 1999 as they finished the round-robin in fourth place, then won their semi-final, and final (both away from home) {{to take another}} championship. Hammett's achievements with the Crusaders <b>were</b> <b>rewarded</b> by being called into the All Blacks in 1999, {{at the age of}} 26. His first game was against New Zealand 'A', on 11 June in Christchurch, quickly followed by his first Test against France on 26 June. Hammett eventually played in the 1999 Tri Nations Series, and was selected for the 1999 Rugby World Cup.|$|E
5|$|The LHQ Medical Research Unit used human test subjects, all volunteers {{drawn from}} the Australian Army, {{including}} a small but notable group of 'Dunera Boys' (Jewish refugees) from the 8th Employment Company. The volunteers were infected with strains of malaria from infected mosquitoes, or from the blood of other test subjects, which was then treated with various drugs. The volunteers <b>were</b> <b>rewarded</b> with three weeks' leave and a certificate of appreciation signed by General Blamey. The LHQ Medical Research Unit researched quinine, sulphonamides, atebrin, plasmoquine, and paludrine.|$|E
5|$|The auxilia were {{recruited}} from among the non-citizens. Organized in smaller units of roughly cohort strength, they were paid less than the legionaries, and after 25 years of service <b>were</b> <b>rewarded</b> with Roman citizenship, also extended to their sons. According to Tacitus there were roughly as many auxiliaries as there were legionaries. The auxilia thus amounted to around 125,000 men, implying approximately 250 auxiliary regiments. The Roman cavalry of the earliest Empire were primarily from Celtic, Hispanic or Germanic areas. Several aspects of training and equipment, such as the four-horned saddle, derived from the Celts, as noted by Arrian and indicated by archaeology.|$|E

5|$|Two {{victories}} – away to Aalborg {{and at home}} to Celtic – {{and four}} draws were enough to secure passage to the knockout phase of the competition. Following a Celtic victory over Villarreal in the final group match, United went through as group winners. This meant that they would avoid Roma, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Porto and Juventus in the first knockout round; however, their potential opposition still included Internazionale, Lyon and Real Madrid. The draw paired Manchester United with José Mourinho's Internazionale, but since United had won their group, they <b>were</b> <b>rewarded</b> by having the second leg at home.|$|E
5|$|Under Boyd's {{captaincy}} Birmingham {{reached the}} semifinals of the 1950–51 FA Cup, {{when they were}} defeated by the powerful Blackpool side of Stanley Matthews and Stan Mortensen only after a replay. They twice came close to winning promotion, missing out by three points in the 1950–51 season and then on goal average the following year. Boyd's performances <b>were</b> <b>rewarded</b> with selection for England B against Netherlands B, a match played {{in front of a}} crowd of 60,000 at the Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam, but this, and a selection as reserve for a Football League representative team in 1954, was as close as he came to full international honours.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{believe that}} the strike, and other strikes in Africa during the period, changed the urban and {{migration}} policies of the British government in Africa. Governor Hubert Young, after a long struggle, obtained research funding of labour migration in Africa. Historian Godfrey Wilson studied urban African labour from 1939 to 1940, but his work was halted. Although the strike achieved little at the time, it is seen a key moment {{in the emergence of}} African nationalism in Zambia. African townsmen discovered their identity, leading to trade unionism and the gradual emergence of anti-colonial politics. The actions by British authorities led to five years of prosperity for the mining companies; European miners struck for higher pay and <b>were</b> <b>rewarded.</b> In 1940, there were several mine strikes in the province which lasted over a week; 17 workers were killed and 65 injured.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the revolt, French power extended throughout Poitou, threatening the interests of the Lusignan family. In 1247 Henry encouraged his relatives to travel to England, where they <b>were</b> <b>rewarded</b> with large estates, largely {{at the expense of the}} English barons. More Poitevins followed, until around 100 had settled in England, around two-thirds of them being granted substantial incomes worth £66 or more by Henry. Henry encouraged some to help him on the continent; others acted as mercenaries and diplomatic agents, or fought on Henry's behalf in European campaigns. Many were given estates along the contested Welsh Marches, or in Ireland, where they protected the frontiers. For Henry, the community was an important symbol of his hopes to one day reconquer Poitou and the rest of his French lands, and many of the Lusignans became close friends with his son Edward.|$|E
5|$|Phips and {{the crew}} <b>were</b> <b>rewarded</b> by the investors with medals, and Phips was knighted by James in June. James also rewarded Phips with the post of provost marshal general (chief sheriff) of the Dominion of New England, serving under Sir Edmund Andros. In September 1687 Phips {{returned}} to the wreck, {{though he did not}} command the venture. Admiral Narborough elected to personally lead the expedition, but it was not nearly as successful. The wreck had been discovered by others, and the arrival of the English scattered more than 20 smaller ships. Treasure worth £10,000 was recovered before Narborough's death in May 1688 brought the expedition to an end. Phips had by then already left the wreck site in early May, sailing for Boston for what seems to have been his first time home in four and a half years, to take up his new post as provost marshal general.|$|E
5|$|The teams {{came out}} for the second half, and Rangers began an attack almost immediately. A series of short, quick passes from Marsh and Roger Morgan {{released}} Allen {{but he was not}} quick enough to make something of the chance. A high pass from Keen followed, striking defender Clarke in the back, from which the Albion defence were forced to clear. The attacks continued to come from Rangers as Lazarus passed the ball through to Marsh who took the ball around two defenders, but his shot went over the bar. QPR <b>were</b> <b>rewarded</b> for their perseverance in the sixty-third minute as Lazarus took the ball around Albion captain Graham Williams, crossing the ball in for Morgan, who scored with a header to reduce the deficit to a single goal.|$|E

5|$|Astell was {{the only}} HEIC ship to escape, disappearing in the {{darkness}} and later reaching a safe port from which despatches were sent to London recounting the action. On {{the basis of these}} accounts, the crew and officers of Astell <b>were</b> <b>rewarded</b> with £2,000 from the company directors to be shared among them. Casualties in the British convoy had been heavy, Windham losing six killed and 18 wounded, Ceylon six killed and 21 wounded (including Meriton and Oldham) and Astell eight killed and 37 wounded (including Hay). In all, 20 British sailors and soldiers were killed and 76 wounded during the engagement, a figure which was matched by the French losses of 22 killed and 38 wounded: four killed and six wounded on Bellone, 17 killed and 29 wounded on Minerve and one killed and three wounded on Victor. The prizes were very severely damaged and Duperré was forced to take his squadron to an isolated beach on Anjouan until 17 July to effect repairs, before returning to Île de France. Command of Ceylon, renamed Ceylan was awarded to Lieutenant Vincent Moulac, of Minerve, and that of Windham, to ensign d'Arod.|$|E
5|$|For printing, {{the mass}} {{production}} of paper for writing was already well established in China. The papermaking process had been perfected and standardized by the Han dynasty court eunuch Cai Lun (50–121) in 105, {{and was in}} widespread use for writing even by the 3rd century. The Song dynasty was the world's first government in history to issue paper-printed money—the banknote (see Jiaozi and Huizi). Toilet paper had been in general use in China since the 6th century, paper bags for preserving the flavor of tea leaves by the 7th century, and by the Song dynasty government officials who had done a great service <b>were</b> <b>rewarded</b> by the court with gifts of paper-printed money wrapped in paper envelopes. During the Song dynasty, independent and government sponsored industries were developed {{to meet the needs}} of a growing population that had reached over 100 million. For example, for the printing of paper money alone, the Song court established several government-run mints and factories in the cities of Huizhou, Chengdu, Hangzhou, and Anqi. The size of the workforce employed in these paper money factories was quite large, as it was recorded in 1175 that the factory at Hangzhou alone employed more than a thousand workers a day.|$|E
5|$|Gillings had an {{inventory}} of material that he had acquired while editing Fantasy, and he drew on this for Science Fantasy, as well as incorporating his own fanzine, Science Fantasy Review, into the new magazine. Once Carnell took over, Science Fantasy typically ran a long lead novelette along with several shorter stories; prominent contributors in the 1950s included John Brunner, Ken Bulmer, and Brian Aldiss, whose first novel Nonstop appeared (in an early version) in the February 1956 issue. Fantasy stories began to appear more frequently during {{the latter half of}} the 1950s, and in the early 1960s Carnell began to publish Thomas Burnett Swann's well-received historical fantasies. Carnell felt that the literary quality of Science Fantasy was always higher than that of New Worlds, and in the early 1960s his efforts <b>were</b> <b>rewarded</b> with three consecutive Hugo nominations for best magazine. Under Bonfiglioli more new writers appeared, including Keith Roberts, Brian Stableford and Josephine Saxton. In the opinion of science fiction historian Mike Ashley, the final year of Impulse, as it was titled by that time, included some of the best material ever published in a British science fiction magazine.|$|E
