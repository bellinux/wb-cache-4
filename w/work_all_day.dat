And then we'd <b>work</b> <b>all</b> <b>day.</b> We're very much the odd couple.|$|E
5|$|Ivan Bagramyan {{was born}} to Armenian parents {{in the village of}} Chardakhlu, near Yelizavetpol (modern Ganja, Azerbaijan), then a part of the Russian Empire. Chardakhlu was one of the largest Armenian {{settlements}} in the South Caucasus populated almost entirely by migrants from the village of Maghavuz in Nagorno Karabakh who continued keeping a connection with their ancestral land. Hamazasp Babadzhanian, a fellow Armenian who was to become the chief marshal of the Soviet Armor corps, was born in the same village. While Bagramyan's father, Khachatur, went to <b>work</b> <b>all</b> <b>day</b> at the railway station in Yelizavetpol, his mother, Mariam, stayed at home {{to take care of her}} seven children. Because his parents could not afford to send him to the local gymnasium, they decided to enroll him at a recently opened two-year school in Yelizavetpol.|$|E

25|$|The gait of the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog {{should have}} {{movement}} {{with a level}} back. Their gait should have good reach in front with a powerful drive in the rear. Soundness, balance and efficiency which accompany correct structure and good condition are crucial factors in their movement, not speed. Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs were bred to <b>work</b> <b>all</b> <b>day</b> on a farm and need stamina. They are a large breed; because of their history as farm dogs in mountainous terrain, they are extremely agile and this is apparent in their gait.|$|E
25|$|Mueller {{increasingly}} {{believed that}} {{to move up}} {{in the hierarchy of}} the Labs he would need a PhD, and he began working towards this goal on a part-time basis at Princeton University, getting up every morning at around 5 o'clock and driving to Princeton to take a couple of courses before driving back down to Holmdel to <b>work</b> <b>all</b> <b>day</b> at Bell Labs. In 1946 a colleague at the Labs, Milton Boone, a professor from Ohio State University on leave at Bell Labs during the war, encouraged Mueller to help set up a vacuum tube lab and run the communications group at Ohio State.|$|E
25|$|Every day {{she begged}} {{to be able}} to enter a temple and become a nun instead of marrying. Her father {{eventually}} allowed her to work in the temple, but asked the monks to give her the toughest chores in order to discourage her. The monks forced Miaoshan to <b>work</b> <b>all</b> <b>day</b> and all night while others slept in order to finish her work. However, she was such a good person that the animals living around the temple began to help her with her chores. Her father, seeing this, became so frustrated that he attempted to burn down the temple. Miaoshan put out the fire with her bare hands and suffered no burns. Now struck with fear, her father ordered her to be put to death.|$|E

However, upon {{arriving}} at {{one in the}} area they {{found that it was}} too beautiful, as they had wanted a lake that was the equivalent of the dour office: [...] "the bleakest lake [...] find." [...] Eventually, much of the episode was filmed at a fake beach at the reservoir of Hansen Dam, where it was [...] "a thousand degrees during the day and minus 40 at night," [...] Celotta remarked in the DVD audio commentary. [...] "We had tents pumping air conditioning that didn't <b>work</b> <b>all</b> <b>day</b> long," [...] according to one crew member.

500|$|Although many of Bo's campaigns earned popular support, {{especially}} from the city's poor, his leadership style {{has been described as}} [...] "propagandistic," [...] "ruthless," [...] and [...] "arrogant" [...] by subordinates and city officials, academics, journalists, and other professionals. Michael Wines of The New York Times wrote that although Bo was possessed of [...] "prodigious charisma and deep intelligence," [...] these qualities were offset by a [...] "studied indifference to the wrecked lives that littered his path to power...Mr. Bo's ruthlessness stood out, even in a system where the absence of formal rules ensures that only the strongest advance." [...] Bo placed onerous demands on government officials in the city, requiring them to be available to <b>work</b> <b>all</b> <b>day</b> and all night, seven days a week. He reportedly called subordinates to late-night meetings, publicly criticized and humiliated those with whom he disagreed, and even hit underlings who failed to meet his demands. According to a psychologist quoted by the Daily Telegraph, since Bo Xilai assumed power, [...] "depression, burn out and suicides have all risen among officials...

500|$|... "Next" [...] {{was written}} by Jenna Bans and Kevin Murphy and {{directed}} by Larry Shaw. While developing storylines for the second season, series creator Marc Cherry stated, [...] "I want to keep {{finding new ways to}} talk about issues that relate to everyday women," [...] explaining that the show needs to focus on [...] "small, real, everyday issues" [...] {{in order to keep the}} audience interested. Cherry cited the Lynette storyline as an example of this strategy: [...] "Lynette will have a job next season (returning to her advertising roots), so I want to address how difficult it is to go to <b>work</b> <b>all</b> <b>day</b> and then come home and be expected to also take care of your house." [...] Huffman recognized that her character's storylines needed a change of pace, but hoped that Lynette's domestic life would still play an integral role this season. [...] "My hope is to not get lost in the corporate world; that it's still a home and family/husband and children story," [...] she explained. [...] "But how many times can you go, 'Kids, clear your plates!'" [...] The episode also introduced Joely Fisher as Lynette's new boss, Nina Fletcher. Fisher describes her character as [...] "nasty," [...] elaborating: [...] "Lynette suddenly has to come up against this tiger lady who never stops reminding Lynette that she's childless by choice. Even though Nina is not a housewife, she is desperate in her own way." [...] Due to the death of his character, Steven Culp did not return to the series for the second season. For the open casket scene in [...] "Next", producers created a life mask of the actor. Savant was promoted to series regular after appearing as a recurring guest star throughout the first season.|$|E

2500|$|Results {{indicate}} that, on average, {{performance with}} a {{blood alcohol level}} of 0.05% remained equivalent to performance after being awake for 16.9 to 18.6 hours. Performance with a blood alcohol level of 0.1% was equivalent to performance after being awake for 17.7 to 19.7 hours, or to restricted sleep of 4 to 5 hours per night for 1 week. Similar studies that compare performance after a time of sleep deprivation to performance with elevated blood alcohol level have confirmed these results. These findings are compelling as the duration of wakefulness (17 hours), which results in decrements {{that are similar to}} those that are induced by a 0.05% blood alcohol level, is {{considered by many to be}} within the range of a [...] "normal" [...] waking [...] "day"; many individuals can recall an incident in which they had to waken early in the morning and <b>work</b> <b>all</b> <b>day</b> into the night.

2500|$|A Working Kelpie {{can be a}} {{cheap and}} {{efficient}} worker that can save farmers and graziers the cost of several hands when mustering livestock. The good working Kelpies are herding dogs that will prevent stock from {{moving away from the}} stockman. This natural instinct is crucial when mustering stock in isolated gorge country, where a good dog will silently move ahead of the stockman and block up the stock (usually cattle) until the rider appears. The preferred dogs for cattle work are Kelpies, often of a special line, or a Kelpie cross. [...] They will drive a mob of livestock long distances in extremes of climates and conditions. Kelpies have natural instincts for managing livestock. They will work sheep, cattle, goats, pigs, poultry, and other domestic livestock. The Kelpie's signature move is to jump on the backs of sheep and walk across the tops of the sheep to reach the other side and break up the jam. A good working Kelpie is a versatile dogthey can <b>work</b> <b>all</b> <b>day</b> on the farm, ranch, or station, and trial on the weekends. Kelpies compete and are exhibited in livestock working trials, ranging from yards or arenas to large open fields working sheep, goats, cattle, or ducks.|$|E
