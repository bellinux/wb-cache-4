Sélestat quickly became specialised in <b>wire</b> <b>gauze</b> making but it never became a large industrial centre, remaining a small town with limited influence. The completion of the Strasbourg-Basel railway (1840), one of the first to be built in France, did not lead to significant urban development. The town walls that still encircled the town were a significant factor in its economic and demographic stagnation. After the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, Alsace and a part of Lorraine were annexed by the new German Empire. The German authorities demolished the city walls in 1874 and built new spacious neighbourhoods around the old town, as they did in Strasbourg and Metz.|$|E
25|$|The {{shielding}} material used – <b>wire</b> <b>gauze,</b> fabric or foam – {{is designed}} {{to have a significant}} acoustic impedance. The relatively low particle-velocity air pressure changes that constitute sound waves can pass through with minimal attenuation, but higher particle-velocity wind is impeded to a far greater extent. Increasing the thickness of the material improves wind attenuation but also begins to compromise high frequency audio content. This limits the practical size of simple foam screens. While foams and wire meshes can be partly or wholly self-supporting, soft fabrics and gauzes require stretching on frames, or laminating with coarser structural elements.|$|E

The experimental programme included flow resistance and heat transfer experiments performed for air flow (Re = 2 – 300) using three woven gauzes and one knitted gauze.

60|$|If this blue {{solution}} were combustible, {{and we were}} {{to place}} a wick {{at the top of}} the salt, it would burn as it entered into the wick. It is a most curious thing to see this kind of action taking place, and to observe how singular some of the circumstances are about it. When you wash your hands, you take a towel to wipe off the water; and it is by that kind of wetting, or that kind of attraction which makes the towel become wet with water, that the wick is made wet with the tallow. I have known some careless boys and girls (indeed, I have known it happen to careful people as well) who, having washed their hands and wiped them with a towel, have thrown the towel over the side of the basin, and before long it has drawn all the water out of the basin and conveyed it to the floor, because it happened to be thrown over the side in such a way as to serve the purpose of a syphon.[5] That you may the better see the way in which the substances act one upon another, I have here a vessel made of <b>wire</b> <b>gauze</b> filled with water, and you may compare it in its action to the cotton in one respect, or to a piece of calico in the other. In fact, wicks are sometimes made of a kind of <b>wire</b> <b>gauze.</b> You will observe that this vessel is a porous thing; for if I pour a little water on to the top, it will run out at the bottom. You would be puzzled for a good while if I asked you what the state of this vessel is, what is inside it, and why it is there? The vessel is full of water, and yet you see the water goes in and runs out as if it were empty. In order to prove this to you, I have only to empty it. The reason is this,--the wire, being once wetted, remains wet; the meshes are so small that the fluid is attracted so strongly from the one side to the other, as to remain in the vessel although it is porous. In like manner the particles of melted tallow ascend the cotton and get to the top; other particles then follow by their mutual attraction for each other, and as they reach the flame they are gradually burned.|$|E
60|$|Suppose I take a candle, {{and examine}} {{that part of}} it which appears {{brightest}} to our eyes. Why, there I get these black particles, which already you have seen many times evolved from the flame, and which I am now about to evolve in a different way. I will take this candle and clear away the gutterage, which occurs by reason of the currents of air; and if I now arrange a glass tube so as just to dip into this luminous part, as in our first experiment, only higher, you see the result. In place of having the same white vapour that you had before, you will now have a black vapour. There it goes, as black as ink. It is certainly very different from the white vapour; and when we put a light to it, we shall find that it does not burn, but that it puts the light out. Well, these particles, as I said before, are just the smoke of the candle; and this brings to mind that old employment which Dean Swift recommended to servants for their amusement, namely, writing on the ceiling of a room with a candle. But what is that black substance? Why, it is the same carbon which exists in the candle. How comes it out of the candle? It evidently existed in the candle, or else we should not have had it here. And now I want you to follow me in this explanation. You would hardly think that all those substances which fly about London, in the form of soots and blacks, are the very beauty and life of the flame, and which are burned in it as those iron filings were burned here. Here is a piece of <b>wire</b> <b>gauze,</b> which will not let the flame go through it; and I think you will see, almost immediately, that when I bring it low enough to touch that part of the flame which is otherwise so bright, that it quells and quenches it at once, and allows a volume of smoke to rise up.|$|E

It was three o'clock, and the old cook, as usual, asleep in an armchair, with her apron thrown up between her face and the fire. What would Cookie say if she knew? In that oven she had been allowed to bake in fancy perfect little doll loaves, while Cookie baked them in reality. Here she had watched the mysterious making of pink cream, had burned countless 'goes' of toffy, and cocoanut ice; and tasted all kinds of loveliness. Dear old Cookie! Stealing about on tiptoe, seeking what she might devour, she found four small jam tarts and ate them, while the cook snored softly. Then, by the table, that looked so like a great loaf-platter, she stood contemplating cook. Old darling, with her fat, pale, crumply face! Hung to the dresser, opposite, was a little mahogany looking-glass tilted forward. Nedda could see herself almost down to her toes. 'I mean to be prettier than I am!' she thought, putting her hands on her waist. 'I wonder if I can pull them in a bit!' Sliding her fingers under her blouse, she began to pull at certain strings. They would not budge. They were loose, yes, really too comfortable. She would have to get the next size smaller!

To be deserting in spirit all that had been so good to her--it seemed like a crime! She slid down off the table and, passing behind the cook, put her arms round those substantial sides. Without meaning to, out of sheer emotion, she pressed them somewhat hard, and, as from a concertina emerges a jerked and drawn-out chord, so from the cook came a long, quaking sound; her apron fell, her body heaved, and her drowsy, flat, soft voice, greasy from pondering over dishes, murmured: ...|$|E

There are limited researches on the use of biomaterials to assist healing process in Bangladesh done earier. Therefore, this experiment was carried out to exploit the therapeutic effects of PRP gel on healing process. For bone healing study, total 6 oblique tibial fracture cases in goats were created. Goats were divided into three groups with two animals in each group bearing weight 15 - 20 kg and age 1 - 3 years. Among these two groups were treated with homogenous PRP gel and one group was untreated served as control and fracture cases were corrected with open reduction and internal fixation using bone plate with screw and surgical stainless steel <b>wire</b> (18 <b>Gauze)</b> suture.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{zygomatic}} maxillary complex (ZMC) fractures {{are one of}} {{the most}} frequent injuries of the facial skeleton due to its position and facial contour. Assaults, road traffic accidents and falls are the principal etiologic factors that may cause fractures of zygomatic bone. The different fixation methods are applied to treat the zygomatic bone fractures, with many more classifications which have been described in the literature for the ease of management. The type of the fracture, its severity and associated facial fractures usually interferes the treatment modality. Purpose of study The aim of this paper is to show the results of 18 yrs prospective blind comparative study using wire and plate osteosynthesis which needed open reduction and internal fixation involving Type II to Type IV Spissel and Schroll ZMC fractures. Materials and methods Total 80 cases included in the study out of 1780 ZMC cases which were treated using wire and plate osteosynthesis over a period of 18 yrs, involving only Type II to Type IV Spissel and Schroll ZMC fractures. Other types excluded from study to prevent observer bias. All the fixations carried out through Standard Dingman's incision using stainless steel 26 <b>gauze</b> <b>wire</b> and titanium 1. 5 mm mini plate system under general anesthesia by single maxillofacial surgeon and evaluated by another maxillofacial surgeon who is blinded for surgical procedure after 2 and 4 wks of follow-up for facial symmetry, wound healing, functional assessment (mouth opening, diplopia), and sensory disturbance. All the data tabulated in Excel software (Microsoft) for statistical analysis. P-value calculated to know the Significance of treatment modality in all aspects. Results Result shows no significant p-values indicating both the operating techniques are equally efficient in the surgical management of ZMC fracture. Conclusion Osteosynthesis by mini plates is simple, logical and effective treatment compared to wire osteosynthesis in regard to stability of fracture fragments. Wire osteosynthesis will be helpful in emergency surgeries or where the mini plates are not available. Even though the wire osteosynthesis is economical compared to mini plate fixation; but the time and skill is required for fixation of wires. </p...|$|R

Malaria in Central Bangka Regency in 2007 was reported with an Annual Malaria Incidence (AMI) of 38, 07 ‰. Especially in Koba (Sub-District), the cases were still high, and Annual Malaria Incidence (AMI) was measured at 48, 1 ‰. and Annual Parasite Incidence (API) was 30, 52 ‰. Hence, Central Bangka Regency was still above the National Annual Malaria Incidence (AMI) which was measured less than 30 ‰. Method : An observational retrospective research by Case Control Study Design method was done to measure the risk factor of independent variable of indoor, out door and its effect effect on malaria incidence. The case group was people with blood specimen positive malaria while the control group was negative blood specimen. The number of patients and control groups were both 76. Data were analyzed by using Chi-square analysis for bivariate analysis and logistic regression analysis for multivariate analysis. Result : Anopheles identification showed, that malaria vector was consisted of Anopheles sundaicus, Anopheles letifer and Anopheles Nigerrimus. The dominant species was Anopheles letifer because the population vector {{was more than the}} others. The analysis result of bivariate was demonstrated that sex was a risk factor for malaria incidence.

Malaria in Central Bangka Regency in 2007 was reported with an Annual Malaria Incidence (AMI) of   38, 07 ‰. Especially in Koba (Sub-District), the cases were still high, and Annual Malaria Incidence (AMI) was measured at  48, 1 ‰. and Annual Parasite Incidence (API) was 30, 52 ‰. Hence, Central Bangka Regency was still above the National Annual Malaria Incidence (AMI) which was measured less than   30 ‰. Method : An observational retrospective research by Case Control Study Design method was done to measure the risk factor of independent variable of indoor, out door and its effect  effect on malaria incidence. The case group was people with blood specimen positive malaria while the control group was negative blood specimen. The number of patients and control groups were both 76. Data were  analyzed by using Chi-square analysis for bivariate analysis and logistic regression analysis for multivariate analysis. Result : Anopheles identification showed, that malaria vector was consisted of   Anopheles sundaicus, Anopheles letifer and Anopheles nigerrimus. The dominant species was Anopheles letifer because the population vector {{was more than the}} others. The analysis result of bivariate was demonstrated that sex was a  risk factor for malaria incidence. Six  factors were analyzed by multivariate house wall-density (OR= 2, 357; 95 % CI= 1, 019 – 5, 452), the <b>gauze</b> <b>wiring</b> on ventilation (OR = 5, 063; 95 % CI = 1, 925 – 13, 312), the existence of water pond (OR = 4, 407; 95 % CI= 1, 542 - 12, 591), the brush wood existence(OR = 2, 693; 95 % CI = 1, 466 – 5, 985), the usage of mosquito potion (lubricated, roasted, or sprayed) (OR = 7, 169; 95 % CI = 2, 912 – 17, 650). Conclusion : Variable that is most dominant to malaria case is the   usage of mosquito net has value p = 0, 0001 with Confidence Interval (CI) 95 % = 6, 835 - 91, 281  in tin mine region in sub district Koba Central Bangka Regency. Habit applies mosquito net at group of lower case that is 57, 9 %, while at group of konrol habit applies higher mosquito net that is 90, 8 %.
