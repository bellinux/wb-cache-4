40|$|For <b>Willow</b> <b>Tits</b> hoarded food is an {{important}} part of the winter diet. A larger supply of stored food should then be required in areas with long and cold winters than in areas with short and mild winters. Since the storing of winter supplies occurs mainly during a few autumn months, it is then plausible that hoarding intensities at that time should be higher in northern than in southern populations. Foraging and food hoarding intensities in <b>Willow</b> <b>Tits</b> were sampled simultaneously with standardized observation methods in the southern, central and northern parts of the species range during the main hoarding period in autumn. However, hoarding intensities were highest in the central, and not as expected in the northern area. The southernmost birds may have stored almost as much food as the birds in northern populations, although the intensity peak came later in autumn. The observed differences in hoarding intensity were probably due to differences in the supply of storable food items, since <b>Willow</b> <b>Tits</b> encountered food at a higher rate in the central than in the other two areas. Eating intensities were similar in all three areas, around 0. 8 items per minute, and it seems likely that <b>Willow</b> <b>Tits</b> stored supplementary food after satisfying a maintenance requirement of this magnitude. In the northern area subordinate birds hoarded at a higher rate than dominants, whereas this was not the case further south. It is not intuitively clear why this should be so, but foraging at high intensities may be costly. Subordinate birds have secondary access to food and high mortality during cold winters and might therefore work relatively harder in cold areas to build up winter food supplies...|$|R

40|$|Confident {{separation}} of Marsh <b>Tits</b> and <b>Willow</b> <b>Tits</b> remains {{a challenge in}} Britain due to the similar appearance of the local races of both species. Several criteria are available to assist the identification of birds in the hand, but none is completely diagnostic and most are invalid for young juvenile birds. Due to the continued decline in abundance of both species, however, {{it is becoming increasingly}} difficult to trial new identification criteria in the field, as very few ringers are catching sufficient numbers of either species. This paper describes the results of an online survey that was used to test a proposed new identification feature for separating the two species, based on differences in the pattern of colour contrast on the greater covert feathers. The online survey was effective in recruiting a sufficient sample of ringers of varying experience, who were asked to identify images of Marsh <b>Tits</b> or <b>Willow</b> <b>Tits</b> based only on features of the greater coverts that were demonstrated using training images. On average, each ringer correctly identified 82 % of the 18 images, and each image was correctly identified by an average 84 % of the 140 ringers. The pattern of the greater coverts is therefore recommended as an additional, complementary criterion for separating Marsh <b>Tits</b> from <b>Willow</b> <b>Tits.</b> Online surveys are also recommended as an efficient platform for the trialling of identification features among the ringing community...|$|R

40|$|We {{studied the}} effects of {{dominance}} rank on fat deposition and hoarding behaviour in <b>Willow</b> <b>Tits</b> Parus montanus. Dominant individuals can displace subordinates which gives them priority to new food sources; they can also pilfer stored food from subordinates. This gives subordinates less certain access than dominants both to their own caches and to new food sources. Theory predicts that subordinates should invest more than dominants both in body fat reserves and stored food. Empirical evidence is equivocal; some {{studies have shown that}} subordinates built up larger reserves than dominants, whereas others show the opposite. In an earlier indoor experiment, Pravosudov and Lucas found no effect of rank on either hoarding rate or fat reserves, but the experimental design was such that the results were ambiguous. This paper reports on a similar, but improved, experiment in outdoor aviaries. However, our results agree with the earlier experiment, since we found no effect of rank on either food storing or fat deposition. The reasons for this are explored...|$|R

50|$|A {{measure of}} the {{difficulty}} in identification is given by the fact that, in the UK, the <b>willow</b> <b>tit</b> was not identified as distinct from marsh tit until 1897. Two German ornithologists, Ernst Hartert and Otto Kleinschmidt, were studying marsh tit skins at the British Museum and found two wrongly-labelled willow tits amongst them (two <b>willow</b> <b>tit</b> specimens were then collected at Coalfall Wood in Finchley, north London, and that species {{was added to the}} British list in 1900).|$|E
40|$|Many {{birds and}} mammals store energy as hoarded food supplies. A supply of stored food is {{beneficial}} during periods when food is scarce, but building up and managing such a supply also entails costs. The optimal number of caches will be reached when the net benefit is at its maximum. If dominants can steal more stored food from subordinates {{than the other way}} around, the optimum will differ between these categories. A previous theoretical model of hoarding in groups with dominant and subordinate members produced three testable predictions: (1) hoarders should store more food as anticipated future conditions get worse; (2) subordinate flock members should store more food than dominants; and (3) dominants should increase hoarding relatively more than subordinates as conditions get worse. Here we present a field experiment on <b>willow</b> <b>tits</b> (Parus montanus) designed to test these predictions. We found support for all three. Hoarding increased as conditions got worse, subordinates stored at a higher rate than dominants, and dominants increased their hoarding effort relatively more than subordinates as conditions worsened. These results support the incorporation of information on dominance and food availability into models predicting food storage behaviour...|$|R

50|$|Marsh and willow tits are {{difficult}} to identify on appearance alone; the races occurring in the UK (P. p. dresseri and P. m. kleinschmidti respectively) are especially hard to separate. When caught for ringing, the pale 'cutting edge' of the marsh tit's bill is a reliable criterion; otherwise, {{the best way to}} tell apart the two species is by voice. Plumage characteristics include the lack of a pale wing panel (formed by pale edges to the secondary feathers in the <b>willow</b> <b>tit),</b> the marsh tit's glossier black cap and smaller black 'bib', although none of these is 'completely reliable'; for example, juvenile marsh tits can show a pale wing panel.

40|$|Predators {{may either}} learn to avoid aposematic prey or may avoid {{it because of}} an innate bias. Learned as well as innate {{avoidance}} has been observed in birds, but the existing evidence is based on experiments with rather few unrelated model species. We compared the origin of avoidance in European species of tits (Paridae). First, we tested whether wild-caught birds (blue tits, great tits, crested <b>tits,</b> coal <b>tits,</b> <b>willow</b> <b>tits,</b> and marsh tits) avoid aposematic (red and black) adult firebugs Pyrrhocoris apterus (Heteroptera) more than nonaposematic (brown painted) ones. Larger proportion of birds avoided aposematic than brown-painted firebugs in majority of species (except coal tits). Second, we tested whether naive hand-reared birds of 4 species (blue tits, great tits, crested tits, and coal tits) attack or avoid aposematic and nonaposematic firebugs, both novel for them. Behavior of the naive blue tits and coal tits {{was similar to that}} of the wild-caught birds; majority of them did not attack the firebugs. Contrastingly, the naive great tits and crested tits behaved differently than the wild-caught conspecific adults; majority of the wild-caught birds avoided the aposematic firebugs, whereas the naive birds usually did not show any initial avoidance and had to learn to avoid the aposematic prey. Our results show that the origin of avoidance may be different even in closely related species. Because blue tits and coal tits avoided not only aposematic firebugs but also their brown-painted form, we interpret their behavior as innate neophobia rather than innate bias against the warning coloration.

5|$|Outside the {{breeding}} season, {{small groups of}} goldcrests maintain exclusive winter feeding territories, which they defend against neighbouring groups. As they roam around their territory, they frequently join loose flocks of other wanderers such as tits and warblers. This kinglet, like other species that prefer mixed-species foraging flocks in winter, hunts over a greater range of heights and vegetation types than when feeding alone. For species that tend to feed in flocks, foraging success while in a flock was about twice that for solitary birds. A consequence of feeding in a flock is that foraging sites may be restricted to avoid competition with other species. In a Swedish study, coal tits and goldcrests foraged in the outer foliage, while the larger willow and European crested tits used the inner canopy. In sites where the numbers of <b>willow</b> and crested <b>tits</b> was artificially reduced, goldcrests and coal tits extended their foraging to include the inner canopy, but {{did not do so}} where the larger tits were retained. In some areas, wintering birds have developed the habit of coming to feeding stations and bird tables to take fat, sometimes with warblers such as the common chiffchaff and blackcap.|$|R
