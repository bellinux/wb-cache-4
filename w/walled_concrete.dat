5000|$|A.W. Baxter (1928 - March 7, 2005) was a Californian {{winemaker}} {{who founded}} Veedercrest Vineyards which {{competed in the}} Judgment of Paris wine tasting. The Veedercrest entrant was Baxter's first commercial vintage Chardonnay. He began buying grapes and making wine {{in the basement of}} his home in the Berkeley hills. He then acquired land on Mt. Veeder in Napa and planted a vineyard of Cabernet Sauvignon funded by selling limited partnership shares. Eventually the wine making volume outgrew his home and at the suggestion of one of the limited partners, C. R. Nelson, he moved his winemaking to a thick <b>walled</b> <b>concrete</b> building at the by then closed Shell Shell Development Companies' Emeryville research lab. The business failed when the winery's distributor dropped prices to work off excess inventory. His wife Gail Fleming was one of the 25 people who died in the 1991 Oakland firestorm ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{with the design}} of an acoustic cavity (transmission suite) for the vibro-acoustic characterization of lightweight panels. This setup has the big advantage of being a small (1150 x 984 x 820 mm) which allows {{the identification of the}} studied behaviour for both structure- and air- borne excitation, on panels of different size (from A 4 to A 2) and thickness (up to 5 cm). Particular effort is made for selecting an optimum geometric configuration. Taking into account the acoustic eigenfrequencies’ occurrences up to the Schroeder frequency and considering the surface averaged sound absorption coefficient (α) this design leads to the smoothest and most uniform distribution of the natural frequencies of the acoustic cavity. The final design results in a non-parallel <b>walled</b> <b>concrete</b> box of moderate dimensions. Specific care is taken for the implementation and building of the test setup. The resulting facility allows the identification of both structure-borne and air-borne acoustic isolation parameters in lightweight panels of different size. ...|$|E

The original standard gauge line runs in a <b>concrete</b> <b>walled</b> cutting, located between the station and adjoining street, with a number of bridges crossing this cutting to provide station access. The platform on the standard gauge [...] "East" [...] line is located in the cutting at the Melbourne end of the station. Alumatta Loop is currently located to the south of the station on the standard gauge line.|$|R
5000|$|Constructed to {{the rear}} of the station {{building}} on the eastern side of the site is a brick <b>walled</b> and <b>concrete</b> roofed air raid shelter of the [...] "pill box" [...] type. Apart from a more recent window which has been cut into one of the walls the structure is very intact and is now used as a storage space. Also located at the rear of the site on a higher level than the station building is a clay base tennis court. The original retaining walls to the court have been replaced by a system of interlocking landscape blocks which have been planted out with strawberry creepers. The court is surrounded by a combination of chain wire fencing and timber battens both set on a main timber frame. Located on the eastern side of the tennis court is a small timber framed and battened shelter shed. Generally the grounds are very well maintained.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of flexible formwork {{has made it}} possible to cast optimised geometrically complex and thin <b>walled</b> reinforced <b>concrete</b> structures. At the same time, advanced composite materials offer the opportunity {{to solve the problem of}} steel corrosion, which can affect aging of concrete structures. With the goal of achieving sustainable design, being able to combine optimised geometries with durable construction materials is a major challenge for civil engineering. New research at the University of Bath and the University of Miami aims to completely replace internal steel reinforcement in geometrically complex concrete structures with durable and ready-to-use cages made of fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) reinforcement. By fabricating the reinforcement in the desired geometry, it will be possible to provide the required strength exactly where needed, thereby reducing the amount of concrete required to resist internal forces and capitalizing on the extraordinary possibilities offered by both concrete and FRP construction materials. The design of such optimized elements and the automated process of manufacturing the Wound FRP (W-FRP) reinforcement are presented in this paper...|$|R

5000|$|One {{proposal}} for Regency Mall's reuse {{grew out of}} a series of public forums in 1999 and 2000. This plan would have redeveloped the mall into a combination of park and retail space arranged in a [...] "village" [...] streetscape format. The enclosed mall concourse would have been demolished, and the large anchor stores would have been reconfigured into shopping and office space with restyled facades. Other new buildings would have been constructed; the basin of Rocky Creek, <b>walled</b> into a <b>concrete</b> viaduct when the mall was built, would have been restored to a more natural appearance; and park and recreation space would have been made part of the site.

40|$|During the {{calculation}} for the crack width control in reinforced elements subjected to bending {{as stated in}} the NEN-EN 1992 - 1 - 1 (Eurocode 2) the engineers at ARCADIS found that the outcome of these calculations lead to the application of larger amounts of steel reinforcement in order to limit the crack width in the structure, compared to calculations which were carried out according to the VBC 1995 (NEN- 6720). It was also clear that with increasing cover the amount of steel needed for crack width control in the Eurocode 2 calculations increased substantially compared to the VBC 1995 calculations. Due to these differences, it was necessary to have a better look at the cracking behavior in thick- <b>walled</b> reinforced <b>concrete</b> elements proposed by Eurocode 2. To ensure a safe, durable and economical design for thick-walled reinforced concrete elements, the cracking behavior is analyzed {{with the help of the}} following codes: National European Standards NEN-EN- 1992 - 1 - 1, the NEN 6720 (VBC 1995), the NEN 3880 (VB 1974 / 1985) and also with a numerical analysis of the finite element program DIANA. The influence of the concrete cover and the crack spacing on the cracking behavior are also taken into account. This research provides more insight in which regulation can be used for a safe and durable structure when it comes to the crack width control in thick-walled reinforced structures subjected to bending.

40|$|For many decades, {{degradation}} of concrete by freezing actions {{has been a}} primary interest of research for civil engineers. Past studies mostly relied on expensive and time-consuming experimental or semi-empirical investigations to identify the source of damage that is attributable to substandard aggregates, inadequate entrained air content, highly porous mortar or cement matrix, and use of deicing salts. Theoretical works developed in recent years do not incorporate all these factors in one single model. Very recently, concrete has gained widespread popularity as a cheap alternative to traditional material utilized for containing liquefied natural gas (LNG). Most studies documenting concrete behavior at cryogenic temperatures are obscure. Therefore, poroelastic theory, capable of incorporating aggregate and mortar properties, pore solution characteristics, air void spacing, and environmental exposure has been utilized to model damage triggering stresses and strain in concrete used for two purposes: 1) concrete pavement exposed to freezing and thawing cycles, and 2) <b>concrete</b> <b>walled</b> tanks containing LNG. The solid-liquid phase transformation equilibrium has been redeveloped to demonstrate the effect of pore solution speciation and disjoining pressure on the deformation of freezing concrete. The modeled trends are in good agreement with experimental results obtained from literature. It {{has been found that}} the damage initiating tensile stresses, exhibited at the aggregate-matrix boundary for both the air-entrained and non-air-entrained concrete can be exacerbated by the Mandel-Cryer effect induced by the delayed relaxation of the pore pressure from the aggregate center. The model suggests that high-porosity, low-permeability aggregates are the most vulnerable to D-cracking. Concrete with low-porosity, low-permeability mortar matrix, typical of mortar containing supplementary cementitious materials and/or low water to cement ratio, can withstand freezing deformation even with a spacing factor larger than the recommended value. In addition, thermodynamic analysis shows that the disjoining force favors crystal growth, while the dissolved ions suppress the freezing point but are still capable of building high hydraulic pressure in the pore network. We believe that implementation of these models will help practitioners select appropriate combinations and proportions of concrete mixture constituents to build safe, economic, and durable concrete structures...|$|R
