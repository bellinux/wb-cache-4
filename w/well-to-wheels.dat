30|$|On {{the other}} hand, EVs emit nothing during their operation; so, their tank-to-wheel CO 2 {{emissions}} are zero. It is however more practical {{to know the}} <b>Well-to-Wheel</b> CO 2 emissions generated {{not only by the}} vehicle, but also by the power plant and by the distribution of the electricity. EVs generate around 616  g of CO 2 for each kWh of transmitted energy with lithium batteries [12]. For an urban EV yearly consumption of 4000 to 6000  kWh, 2.5 to 3.7  t of CO 2 are emitted per year. That means that with the average European Union electricity mix, <b>Well-to-Wheel</b> CO 2 emissions of an electric vehicle are about 2.5 times less than those of a gasoline vehicle. If electricity is generated from solar energy, an average of 130  g is emitted for every kWh of generated electricity so, the annual CO 2 emissions range from 0.5 to 0.8  t. The annual emissions may be further reduced to 0.07 to 0.1  t, if wind energy is used. This is the case in countries such as Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and France which would have maximal leverage for climate improvement [12]. Furthermore, the EV <b>Well-to-Wheel</b> emissions can even reach zero if nuclear energy is used in electricity generation.|$|R

This {{is because of the}} various benefits they offer such as high energy efficiency, reductions in petroleum use and greenhouse emissions, and national energy security. The proposed urban EV, with 27 % <b>well-to-wheel</b> efficiency, is twice as efficient as an ICEV and the annual fuel cost of the urban EV is 6 times less than a gasoline one. Moreover, the <b>Well-to-Wheel</b> CO 2 emissions of the EV are about 2.5 times less than those of a gasoline vehicle.

5000|$|Plug-in hybrid {{electric}} vehicles, or PHEVs, are hybrid {{vehicles that}} can be plugged into the electric grid and contain an electric motor and also an internal combustion engine. The PHEV concept augments standard hybrid electric vehicles {{with the ability to}} recharge their batteries from an external source, enabling increased use of the vehicle's electric motors while reducing their reliance on internal combustion engines. The infrastructure required to charge PHEVs is already in place, and transmission of power from grid to car is about 93% efficient. This, however, is not the only energy loss in transferring power from grid to wheels. AC/DC conversion must take place from the grids AC supply to the PHEV's DC. This is roughly 98% efficient. The battery then must be charged. As of 2007, the Lithium iron phosphate battery was between 80-90% efficient in charging/discharging. The battery needs to be cooled; the GM Volt's battery has 4 coolers and two radiators. As of 2009, [...] "the total <b>well-to-wheels</b> efficiency with which a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle might utilize renewable electricity is roughly 20% (although that number could rise to 25% or a little higher with the kind of multiple technology breakthroughs required to enable a hydrogen economy). The <b>well-to-wheels</b> efficiency of charging an onboard battery and then discharging it to run an electric motor in a PHEV or EV, however, is 80% (and could be higher in the future)—four times more efficient than current hydrogen fuel cell vehicle pathways." [...] A 2006 article in Scientific American argued that PHEVs, rather than hydrogen vehicles, would become standard in the automobile industry. [...] A December 2009 study at UC Davis found that, over their lifetimes, PHEVs will emit less carbon than current vehicles, while hydrogen cars will emit more carbon than gasoline vehicles.|$|E
