500|$|Texass {{service with}} the Grand Fleet {{consisted}} entirely of convoy missions and occasional forays {{to reinforce the}} British squadron on blockade duty in the North Sea whenever German heavy units threatened. The fleet alternated between bases at Scapa Flow and at the Firth of Forth in Scotland. Texas began her mission five days after her arrival at Scapa Flow, when she sortied with the entire fleet to reinforce the 4th Battle Squadron, then on duty in the North Sea. She returned to Scapa Flow {{the next day and}} remained until 8 March, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>put</b> to sea on a convoy escort mission from which she returned on 13 March.

Four days later, Texas again stood out to sea to support the Second Battle Squadron the day after the German High Seas Fleet had sortied from Jade Bay toward the Norwegian coast to threaten an Allied convoy. Forward units caught sight of the retiring Germans on 25 April, but at such an extreme range, [...] bringing the German fleet into engagement with the Grand Fleet was not possible. The Germans returned to their base that day, and the Grand Fleet, including Texas, did likewise on the next.|$|E
500|$|Barry Walters from Rolling Stone {{called the}} show [...] "possibly her flashiest, fastest moving, and most {{entertaining}} production yet", {{and added that}} the night belonged to Spears, as [...] "she managed to prove that she's still progressing as a showgirl. Not only that, she's doing it better than even diehard defenders would’ve predicted. At 29, the pop star whose career seemed in danger of ending just {{a couple years ago}} has shown that she's back– hopefully this time to stay." [...] Evelyn McDonnell of Spin said that [...] "the idol America loves to hate went all out. Her body perpetually moved, she sang steadfastly into her headset (okay, she's got plenty of digital support, but she doesn't merely lip-sync), and she shimmied through an endless parade of outfits. [...] Having been knocked down by the tabloid press and the public repeatedly in recent years, Spears is now desperately seeking our attention. And she earns it. Haters go home." [...] Kelley L. Carter of MTV commented that [...] "the Spears that captivated the audience at the Staples Center [...] was the old, fun-loving, free-wheeling Spears— with a sexy, showgirl twist. There wasn't much pretense, though those glamazon outfits blinded in the best way possible. Instead, there was just good dance music." [...] Carla Meyer of The Sacramento Bee stated that [...] "Though Spears performed like a pro throughout the show, hitting all her marks, she had shown hesitancy in her movements— natural for the first stop on a tour. But that hesitancy vanished <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>put</b> on the denim. She seemed at ease." ...|$|E
