500|$|Prince Hall Freemasonry exists {{because of}} the refusal of early American lodges to admit African-Americans. In 1775, an African-American named Prince Hall, along with {{fourteen}} other African-Americans, was initiated into a British military lodge with a warrant from the Grand Lodge of Ireland, having failed to obtain admission from the other lodges in Boston. When the military Lodge left North America, those fifteen men were given the authority to meet as a Lodge, but not to initiate Masons. In 1784, these individuals obtained a Warrant from the Premier Grand Lodge of England (GLE) and formed African Lodge, Number 459. When the UGLE was formed in 1813, all U.S.-based Lodges were stricken from their rolls– due largely to the War of 1812. Thus, separated from both UGLE and any concordantly recognised U.S. Grand Lodge, African Lodge re-titled itself as the African Lodge, Number 1– and became a de facto [...] "Grand Lodge" [...] (this Lodge {{is not to be}} confused with the various Grand Lodges on the Continent of Africa). As <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>U.S.</b> Freemasonry, Prince Hall Freemasonry soon grew and organised on a Grand Lodge system for each state.|$|E

60|$|Mrs. Sanderson had captivated the Doña Maria <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> {{and had no}} {{difficulty}} in persuading the unfortunate woman to receive us into her household.

If one existed then, it existed for Sidney alone--the shadow of a foul possibility. Neither do I believe that Mrs. Sanderson cared to befriend either the Doña Maria Del Valle or myself.|$|E

60|$|The Clarissa went, by the Vineyard Sound and the Shoals, into Boston. Here {{she landed}} a few crates, and then sailed for Wiscasset, where we arrived after a pretty long passage.

Shortly after, we heard of the embargo, and, the Clarissa being laid up, Jack Mallet became one of my school-mates.
