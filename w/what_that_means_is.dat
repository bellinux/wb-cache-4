There is no grace can cure this disease; yes, grace doth rather increase it; for the more grace any man has, the more is he sick of sin; the greater an offence is iniquity to him. So then, there is nothing can cure this disease, but glory: but immortal glory. And dost thou desire this medicine? and doth God testify that thy desire is true, not feigned? (2 Cor. 5:4) I know that {{there are many things that}} do make some even wish to die: but the question is not whether thou dost wish to die: for death can cure many diseases: but is this that that moveth thee to desire to depart: to wit, that thou mightest be rid, quite rid, and stripped of a body of death, because nothing on this side the grave can rid thee and strip thee of it. And is hope, that this day is approaching, a reviving cordial to thee? and doth the hope of this strike arrows into the heart of thy lusts, and draw off thy mind and affections yet farther from iniquity.|$|E

50|$|Often Conrad style ball {{bearings}} will exhibit contact ellipse truncation under axial load. <b>What</b> <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>is</b> {{that either the}} ID {{of the outer ring}} is large enough, or the OD of the inner ring is small enough, so as to reduce the area of contact between the balls and raceway.

40|$|There is {{a general}} {{realization}} within NASA that “onboard autonomy ” is needed. Exact specifications of <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>are</b> often vague {{at the onset of}} the mission design process. Moreover, autonomy technology is generally not well understood by the spacecraft design community, which complicates matters considerably. The work described in this paper is an effort to better define the autonomy needs for fhture planetary exploration missions based on the current mission designs for a set of solar system exploration missions. This is part of an ongoing NASA exercise to define technology needs requirements in order to better set technology fhnding priorities. Autonomy technology needs requirements are classified as either algorithms or architectures. The algorithms have heritage in AI research domains, such as planning and scheduling, monitoring & diagnosis, executives, and image processing. Architectures represent software systems for carrying-out mission objectives, such as low-cost routine operations, landing and hazard avoidance, and opportunistic science data collection. The NASA trend towards “smaller, faster, better, cheaper ” spacecraft that began several years ago has resulted in a cultural and technological shift that favors more aggressive use of software technology onboard the space platform. There are three basic reasons for this. One is to migrate mission operations functions traditionally performed on th...|$|R
