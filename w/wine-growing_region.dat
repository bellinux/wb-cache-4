25|$|Alsace {{is known}} for being the only French <b>wine-growing</b> <b>region</b> with a long {{practice}} in varietal labeling, which was a German tradition long before varietally labelled New world wines scored considerable export success. However, under appellation rules, not all varietal-sounding names on labels need to correspond to a single grape variety. Only one varietal label may be used on a wine, and a blend may not {{have more than one}} varietal name on the label.|$|E

25|$|The Wellington/Wairarapa <b>wine-growing</b> <b>region</b> {{is one of}} New Zealand's smallest, {{with several}} sub-regions, which include Gladstone, Martinborough, Masterton, and Opaki. Martinborough was the {{original}} area planted, {{on the basis of}} careful scientific study, in the 1970s, which identified its soils and climate as perfectly suited to the cultivation of Pinot noir. As a consequence, many of the vineyards established there are older than their counterparts {{in the rest of the}} Wairarapa. Subtle differences are seen in the wines from the South Wairarapa (which includes Martinborough), which has more maritime influences, to those grown further north.|$|E
25|$|Stellenbosch {{is located}} about 50 {{kilometres}} from Cape Town and is {{situated on the}} banks of the Eersterivier ("First River") in the famous <b>wine-growing</b> <b>region</b> and is encircled by picturesque mountains. Teaching at Stellenbosch University is divided between the main campus in Stellenbosch, the Tygerberg campus (where the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences is situated), the Bellville Park campus (where the University of Stellenbosch Business School (USB) is situated), and the Saldanha campus (housing the Faculty of Military Science at the Military Academy of the South African National Defence Force).|$|E
25|$|The Wine Country {{is an area}} of Northern California in the United States known {{worldwide}} as {{a premium}} <b>wine-growing</b> <b>region.</b> Viticulture and wine-making have been practiced in the region since the mid-19th century. There are over 400 wineries in the area north of San Francisco, mostly located in the area's valleys, including Napa Valley in Napa County, and the Sonoma Valley, Alexander Valley, Dry Creek Valley, Bennett Valley, and Russian River Valley in Sonoma County. Wine grapes are also grown at higher elevations, such as Atlas Peak and Mount Veeder AVAs. The region is defined not only by its viticulture, but also its ecology, geology, architecture, cuisine, and culture. The majority of the grape harvest, by both area and value, derives from Sonoma County.|$|E
50|$|The area of Novorossiysk {{is one of}} Russia's main <b>wine-growing</b> <b>regions.</b> The wineries of Abrau-Dyurso, {{established}} by Tsar Alexander III in 1870, produce table and sparkling wines for domestic consumption.|$|R

25|$|Lake breezes {{in spring}} tend to retard fruit bloom until the frost danger is past, {{and in the}} autumn delay the onset of fall frost, {{particularly}} on the south shore. Cool onshore winds also retard early bloom of plants and flowers until later in the spring season, protecting them from possible frost damage. Such microclimatic effects have enabled tender fruit production in a continental climate, with the southwest shore supporting a major fruit-growing area. Apples, cherries, pears, plums, and peaches are grown in many commercial orchards around Rochester. Between Stoney Creek and Niagara-on-the-Lake on the Niagara Peninsula is a major fruit-growing and wine-making area. The <b>wine-growing</b> <b>region</b> extends over the international border into Niagara and Orleans counties. Apple varieties that tolerate a more extreme climate are grown on the lake's north shore, around Cobourg.|$|E
25|$|Hastings grew rapidly {{throughout}} the 1960s and 1970s (Hastings {{at this time}} was the fastest growing city in New Zealand), {{and there was a}} major issue dealing with encroachment of suburban expansion on highly productive land. Flaxmere was established as a satellite suburb to absorb rapid growth and was built upon the stony arid soils of the abandoned course of the Ngaruroro River. Although the land seemed worthless back then, it has subsequently proved highly valued for grape growing, and now is a prized region of red wine varietals in the world-famous Gimblett Gravels <b>wine-growing</b> <b>region.</b> Starting with economic decline nationally in the late 1970s, coupled with agricultural subsidy reforms in the early 1980s, Hastings went into recession with more unemployment and low economic growth. It was not until the mid 1990s that the economy of Hastings began to turn around.|$|E
25|$|The {{early history}} of the Washington wine {{industry}} {{can be traced to}} the introduction of Cinsault grapes by Italian immigrants to the Walla Walla region. In the 1950s and 1960s, the precursors of the state's biggest wineries (Chateau Ste Michelle and Columbia Winery) were founded. Throughout the rest of the 20th century, the wine world discovered a new aspect of Washington wines with each passing decade - starting with Rieslings and Chardonnays in the 1970s, the Merlot craze of the 1980s and the emergence of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah in the 1990s. Washington has fourteen federally defined American Viticultural Areas with all but one located in Eastern Washington. The largest AVA is the Columbia Valley AVA, which extends into a small portion of northern Oregon and encompasses most of the other Washington AVAs. These include the Lewis-Clark AVA, the Ancient Lakes AVA, Walla Walla Valley AVA, the Horse Heaven Hills AVA, the Wahluke Slope AVA, Lake Chelan AVA, Naches Heights AVA, and the Yakima Valley AVA, which in turn also encompasses the Rattlesnake Hills AVA, Snipes Mountain AVA and the Red Mountain AVA. The Columbia Gorge AVA is west of the Columbia Valley AVA. Washington's only AVA located west of the Cascades is the Puget Sound AVA. The Ancient Lakes <b>wine-growing</b> <b>region</b> is the newest AVA in Washington state.|$|E
50|$|Mendrisio {{is known}} in Italian as il magnifico borgo (the {{magnificent}} town) due to its numerous elegant historical buildings. For two decades the town has had a pioneering role in promoting electric cars. The city's surroundings are the main <b>wine-growing</b> <b>regions</b> in Canton Ticino.|$|R
5000|$|In {{continental}} Europe, the Swabian Alb offers {{particularly good}} views of cuestas in Jurassic rock.

2500|$|... 2. Baden - Germany's southernmost, warmest and sunniest <b>wine-growing</b> <b>region,</b> in Germany's southwestern corner, across river Rhine from Alsace, and {{the only}} German wine region {{situated}} in European Union wine growing zone B rather than A, which results in higher minimum required maturity of grapes and less chaptalisation allowed. Noted for its pinot wines - both red and white. The Kaiserstuhl region in the wine growing region of Baden is Germany's warmest location. One of two wine regions in the federal state of Baden-Württemberg.|$|E
2500|$|In the 12th century, {{viticulture}} {{was introduced}} to the region, and the sunny slopes of the lake from Lavaux to Montreux became an important <b>wine-growing</b> <b>region.</b> [...] Montreux is first mentioned in 1215 as Mustruel. [...] In 1295, the Bishop of Sion sold the parish of Montreux to Girard of Oron. [...] In 1317, it was split between the Lords of Oron (Le Châtelard) and the Counts of Savoy (Les Planches). [...] A Brotherhood of the Holy Spirit administered estates and a hospital in Montreux starting in about 1309.|$|E

2500|$|During the 19th century Nantes-born gastronome Charles Monselet {{praised the}} [...] "special character" [...] {{of the local}} [...] "plebeian" [...] cuisine, which {{included}} buckwheat crepes, caillebotte fermented milk and fouace brioche. The Nantes region is renowned in France for market gardens and is a major producer of corn salad, leeks, radishes and carrots. Nantes has a <b>wine-growing</b> <b>region,</b> the Vignoble nantais, primarily south of the Loire. It is the largest producer of dry white wines in France, chiefly Muscadet and Gros Plant (usually served with fish, langoustines and oysters).|$|E
2500|$|The Puget Sound AVA is {{the only}} <b>wine-growing</b> <b>region</b> located in Western Washington. Of the region's 4.75 million acres (1.9 million hectare), only [...] were planted as of 2008-mostly to cool weather {{varieties}} like Madeleine Angevine, Chardonnay, Pinot gris, Pinot noir and Siegerrebe. Granted AVA status in 1995, the appellation extends from {{the foothills of the}} Cascades to the Olympic Peninsula and islands located in Puget Sound. The climate is greatly affected by the marine influences of nearby Puget Sound and the Pacific Ocean which contributes to mild temperatures, wet winters and dry summers—all of which make it ideal for some cool climate grape varieties. The region experiences more sunshine than Bordeaux and is drier in average precipitation than Burgundy.|$|E
2500|$|The Constantia Valley {{is located}} south of Cape Town on the Cape Peninsula that juts {{out into the}} Atlantic Ocean. Because of its location, the region {{receives}} oceanic influences on each side that create a cooling effect contributing to a long, slow ripening period in the summer where average daily temperatures fall between [...] Winters are often moderate and mild but wet with annual precipitation usually over [...] The soil of the region is composed primarily of Table Mountain sandstone with high concentrations of loam and granite. The area grows {{a wide range of}} grapes with Sauvignon blanc being particularly noted. [...] The area is now home to 11 wine farms (Andrews, 2017). It is the oldest <b>wine-growing</b> <b>region</b> in the country, with the farm Groot Constantia being the oldest wine estate.|$|E
5000|$|Almdudler is {{currently}} sold in original, light (sugar-free), [...] "still" [...] (uncarbonated), and g'spritzt (mixed with carbonated mineral water) versions.

40|$|Reducing {{pesticide}} {{use is a}} major challenge in agriculture, and farmers are encouraged to develop integrated practices. The {{aim of this study}} was to describe, analyse and assess the current contribution of various options to pest, disease and weed management on the reduction of fungicides, herbicides and insecticides by quantifying both their use and their effect on {{pesticide use}} intensity, within the context of different <b>wine-growing</b> <b>regions.</b> We conducted a statistical analysis of pesticide use and crop management over two seasons (2006 and 2010) for 11 French <b>wine-growing</b> <b>regions</b> (10, 000 data). We used the Treatment Frequency Index (TFI) indicator to characterise the intensity of pesticide use. We analysed three crop management options: timing of first fungicide spray, type of soil cover cropping, and type of weed control. For each management option, we compared alternative or low-input practices to normal chemical-based practices, e. g., mechanical weed control (alternative option) vs. herbicide (normal chemical option). To strengthen the results, two quantitative variables completed the analysis: fungicide mean sprayed dose in the field and number of fungicides sprayed in the field. Results showed that each alternative or low input practice had an impact on TFI, but that this impact differed between <b>wine-growing</b> <b>regions</b> and between the management options under consideration. Regarding fungicides, our results showed that late timing of first fungicide spray (compared to regional reference) contributed to a reduction up to 50 % of the part of the TFI due to fungicides, as compared to fields sprayed at median or early timing. Regarding herbicides, results of low-input/alternative practices were more homogeneous in terms of their relative impact on TFI reduction. The differences in use and impact of crop protection practices were more important between regions than between the two studied years. Our results may help policy makers to target methods for decreasing pesticide use, based on particularities of <b>wine-growing</b> <b>regions</b> and locally realistic practices...|$|R
