5|$|After Dickinson's death, Lavinia Dickinson {{kept her}} promise and burned {{most of the}} poet's correspondence. Significantly though, Dickinson had left no {{instructions}} about the 40 notebooks and loose sheets gathered in a locked chest. Lavinia recognized the poems' <b>worth</b> <b>and</b> became obsessed with seeing them published. She turned first to her brother's wife and then to Mabel Loomis Todd, her brother's mistress, for assistance. A feud ensued, with the manuscripts divided between the Todd and Dickinson houses, preventing complete publication of Dickinson's poetry {{for more than half}} a century.|$|E
5|$|During April 1887, J.I. Berry {{established}} {{a site for}} a town after he chose a well-watered section along {{the way of the}} Fort <b>Worth</b> <b>and</b> Denver City Railroad, which had begun building across the Texas Panhandle. Berry and Colorado City, Texas, merchants wanted to make their new town site the region's main trading center. On August 30, 1887, Berry's town site won the county seat election and was established in Potter County. Availability of the railroad and freight service after the county seat election made the town a fast-growing cattle-marketing center.|$|E

5|$|Gregory {{was also}} one of the first Christian voices to say that slavery as an {{institution}} was inherently sinful. He believed that slavery violated mankind's inherent <b>worth,</b> <b>and</b> the nature of humanity to be free; a departure from classical, and Judeo-Christian precedent which he rooted in Genesis, arguing that man was given mastery of animals but not of mankind. Although aspects of the slave system had been criticized by Stoics such as Seneca, this was the first and only sustained critique of the institution of slavery itself made in the ancient world.|$|E

He sold bibles and vacuum cleaners door-to-door, and eventually became a sales manager for the Encyclopedia Americana.|$|E
50|$|The {{hospital}} was threatened with downsizing or closure {{as part of}} the NHS Strategic Health Authority's 'Fit For The Future' proposal. A series of marches and protest events were held in both <b>Worthing</b> <b>and</b> Chichester against the plans. In June 2008, the West Sussex Primary Care Trust Board recommended that Worthing Hospital be the 'major general hospital' for West Sussex and that St Richard's Hospital in Chichester be downgraded. The recommendation is that services should be centralised at <b>Worthing</b> <b>and</b> moved away from St Richard's Hospital. In October 2008, the Trust Boards of <b>Worthing</b> <b>and</b> Southlands NHS Trust and the Royal West Sussex NHS Trust agreed ‘in principle’ to a merger. The merger went ahead and formed one organisation called 'Western Sussex Hospitals NHS Trust' which manages St Richard's, <b>Worthing</b> <b>and</b> Southlands hospitals.|$|R

5|$|By {{the time}} the German fleet had arrived, the siege of Peking had already been lifted by forces from {{other members of the}} Eight-Nation Alliance that had formed to deal with the Boxers. Wörth left Taku to coal at Tsingtau, the German naval base in China, and on 25 October {{returned}} to Wusong via Yantai. There, she joined the blockade of the Yangtze River. Since the situation had calmed, the four battleships were sent to Hong Kong or Nagasaki, Japan, in late 1900 and early 1901 for overhauls; Wörth went to Nagasaki from 30 November to the end of December. She returned to Wusong on 27 December, where she remained until 18 February 1901, when she moved to Tsingtau for division exercises and gunnery drills. <b>Wörth</b> <b>and</b> the rest of the fleet then stayed in Shanghai in April and May.|$|E

5|$|From December 1978 to May 1980, Braniff International Airways leased 11 Concordes, five from Air France and six from British Airways. These {{were used}} on subsonic flights between Dallas-Fort <b>Worth</b> <b>and</b> Washington Dulles International Airport, flown by Braniff flight crews. Air France and British Airways crews then took {{over for the}} {{continuing}} supersonic flights to London and Paris. The aircraft were registered in both the United States and their home countries; the European registration was covered while being operated by Braniff, retaining full AF/BA liveries. The flights were not profitable and typically less than 50% booked, forcing Braniff to end its tenure as the only US Concorde operator in May 1980.|$|E
5|$|In Paris it {{was planned}} that two stunt men, B.J. <b>Worth</b> <b>and</b> Don Caldvedt, would help film two takes of a {{parachute}} drop off a (clearly visible) platform that extended from a {{top edge of}} the Eiffel Tower. However, sufficient footage was obtained from Worth's jump, so Caldvedt was told {{he would not be}} performing his own jump. Caldvedt, unhappy at not being able to perform the jump, parachuted off the tower without authorisation from the City of Paris. He was subsequently sacked by the production team for jeopardising the continuation of filming in the city.|$|E
5|$|Permission {{was granted}} {{for the first}} batch of fifteen {{locomotives}} in March 1928, but this was reduced to ten when {{it became apparent that}} they would not immediately be able to operate on the Hastings route. Production delays at Eastleigh railway works meant that they were not delivered until between March and July 1930. Once the original batch had proved their <b>worth</b> <b>and</b> had been well received by the crews a further twenty locomotives were ordered in March 1931 for delivery between December 1932 and March 1934. A third batch of twenty were ordered from Eastleigh in March 1932 for delivery after the completion of the previous order, but this was subsequently reduced to ten locomotives because of the continuing trade depression. The final locomotive in the class was delivered in July 1935.|$|E

5|$|Standard Oil {{initially}} {{chose not}} to become directly involved in oil production in Texas, and instead formed Security Oil Company as a refining operation utilizing Guffey-Gulf and Texas Company as suppliers. Following state lawsuits related to anti-trust statutes, Security Oil was reorganized into Magnolia Petroleum Company in 1911. That same year, the Humble Oil Company (today Exxon Corporation) was formed by Ross Sterling and Walter William Fondren in Humble, Texas. The headquarters were moved to Houston, and the company eventually sold half of its shares to Standard Oil of New Jersey, establishing a long-term partnership that lasted for decades. The company built the Baytown Refinery, which became Texas' largest refining operation. In the post-World War II period, Humble became the largest crude oil transporter in the United States, and built pipelines connecting Baytown to Dallas-Fort <b>Worth</b> <b>and</b> West Texas to the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The B-52 set many records {{over the}} next few years. On 26 September 1958, a B-52D set a world speed record of 560.705miles per hour (487kn, 902km/h) over a 10,000kilometers (5,400nmi, 6,210mi) closed circuit without a payload. The same day, another B-52D {{established}} a world speed record of 597.675miles per hour (519kn, 962km/h) over a 5,000kilometer (2,700nmi, 3,105mi) closed circuit without a payload. On 14 December 1960, a B-52G set a world distance record by flying unrefueled for 10,078.84miles (8,762nmi, 16,227km); the flight lasted 19 hours 44 minutes (510.75mph). From 10 to 11 January 1962, a B-52H (60-0040) set a world distance record by flying unrefueled, surpassing the prior B-52 record set two years earlier, from Kadena Air Base, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan, to Torrejón Air Base, Spain, which covered 12,532.28miles (10,895nmi, 20,177km).

5|$|<b>Wörth</b> <b>and</b> {{the rest}} of the fleet {{operated}} under the normal routine of individual and unit training {{in the first half of}} 1897. The ship represented Germany during the Fleet Review for Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee in June 1897. The typical routine was interrupted in early August when Wilhelm II and Augusta went to visit the Russian imperial court at Kronstadt; both divisions of the I Squadron were sent to accompany the Kaiser. They returned to Neufahrwasser in Danzig on 15 August, where {{the rest of}} the fleet joined them for the annual autumn maneuvers. The maneuvers were completed by 22 September in Wilhelmshaven. In early December, the I Division conducted maneuvers in the Kattegat and the Skagerrak, though they were cut short due to shortages in officers and men.|$|E

5|$|Wörth {{served in}} the German fleet for {{the first decade of}} her career, {{participating}} in the normal peacetime routine of training cruises and exercises. She took part in the German naval expedition to China in 1900 to suppress the Boxer Rebellion, though by the time the fleet arrived the siege of Peking had already been lifted, and Wörth saw little direct action in China. She was placed in reserve in 1906 as newer, more powerful vessels had supplanted the Brandenburg class as front-line battleships. Obsolete by the start of World War I, <b>Wörth</b> <b>and</b> Brandenburg served in a limited capacity in the Imperial German Navy as coastal defense ships for {{the first two years of}} the war, though they did not see action. By 1916, Wörth was reduced to a barracks ship, a role in which she served until the end of hostilities. Despite plans to convert her into a freighter after the war, Wörth was scrapped in the port of Danzig in 1919.|$|E
5|$|As the 1931 gubernatorial {{election}} approached, Chandler and Prestonsburg native Jack Howard {{were mentioned}} as candidates for lieutenant governor. Congressman Fred M. Vinson backed Howard, a fellow Eastern Kentuckian, while political bosses Billy Klair, Johnson N. Camden, Jr., and Ben Johnson supported Chandler. The support of another political boss, Mickey Brennan, gave Chandler the edge at the party's nominating convention. Democratic gubernatorial nominee Ruby Laffoon also owed his selection to the machinations of the state's political bosses, notably his uncle, Congressman Polk Laffoon. Problematically, Chandler was {{an ally of}} former Governor J. C. W. Beckham, Louisville Courier-Journal publisher Robert Worth Bingham, and political boss Percy Haly, which put him at odds with Laffoon, {{a member of a}} Democratic faction headed by Russellville political boss Thomas Rhea and opposed to Beckham, <b>Worth,</b> <b>and</b> Haly. Despite disharmony within the ticket, the worsening of the Great Depression under Republican President Herbert Hoover and Governor Sampson ensured a Democratic victory. Chandler was elected over John C. Worsham by a vote of 426,247 to 353,573. In a break with precedent, Chandler set up an office on the executive floor of the state capitol and worked there full-time; previous lieutenant governors had stayed in Frankfort only during legislative sessions, when they were charged with presiding over the state senate.|$|E
5|$|For {{his great}} {{services}} at Hohenfriedberg, Frederick {{gave him the}} captaincy of Tatiau, which carried with it a salary of 500 thalers a year. Later on he became Governor of Kolberg in Pomerania. At Battle of Hennersdorf, Zieten repulsed the sudden and unexpected assault of the united Austro-Saxon force; Winterfeldt arrived on the field in {{time to take a}} decisive part in the victory. Once again the rivals had to share the laurels, and Zieten wrote to the king in disparagement of Winterfeldt, receiving in reply a full and generous recognition of his own <b>worth</b> <b>and</b> services, coupled with the curt remark that the king intended to employ General von Winterfeldt in any way that he thought fit. During the ten years peace that preceded the next great war, Winterfeldt was in constant attendance upon the king, except when employed on confidential missions in the provinces or abroad. For example, he was sent to London for negotiating the Convention of Westminster. In 1756 he was made a lieutenant general and received the Order of the Black Eagle and the Order Pour le Mérite.|$|E
