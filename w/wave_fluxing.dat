Here we quantify the importance of this linear interference effect in initiating stratosphere-troposphere interactions by performing a decomposition of the vertical <b>wave</b> activity <b>flux</b> using reanalysis data. The interannual variability in vertical <b>wave</b> activity <b>flux</b> in both the Northern and Southern Hemisphere extratropics is dominated by linear interference of quasi-stationary waves during the season of strongest stratosphere-troposphere coupling. Composite analysis of anomalous vertical <b>wave</b> activity <b>flux</b> events reveals the significant role of linear interference and shows that "linear" and "nonlinear" events are essentially independent. Linear interference is the dominant contribution to the vertical <b>wave</b> activity <b>flux</b> anomalies preceding displacement stratospheric sudden warmings (SSWs) while split SSWs are preceded by nonlinear <b>wave</b> activity <b>flux</b> anomalies. <b>Wave</b> activity variability controls the timing of stratospheric final warmings, and this variability is shown to be dominated by linear interference, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere.

From our model results, a remarkable tendency of warming increasing with elevation is found for the winter season, and elevation dependency of warming is not clearly recognized in the summer season. This simulated feature of elevation dependency of ground temperature is consistent with observations. Based on an analysis of surface energy budget, the short wave solar radiation absorbed at the surface plus downward long <b>wave</b> <b>flux</b> reaching the surface shows a strong elevation dependency, and is mostly responsible for enhanced surface warming over the TP. At lower elevations, the precipitation forced by topography is enhanced due to an increase in water vapor supply resulted from a warming in the atmosphere induced by doubling CO 2. This precipitation enhancement must be associated with an increase in clouds, which results in a decline in solar flux reaching surface. At higher elevations, large snow depletion is detected in the 2 xCO 2 run. It leads to a decrease in albedo, therefore more solar flux is absorbed at the surface. On the other hand, much more uniform increase in downward long <b>wave</b> <b>flux</b> reaching the surface is found.

The theory predicts large wave amplitudes, so that 'turbulent' velocities are generally comparable to, or larger than, local expansion velocities in the optical line-emitting regions, thus making the Sobolev approximation invalid.

Current stellar evolution codes fail to reproduce the observed rotation rates by several orders of magnitude and instead predict a drastic spin-up of red giant cores. New efficient mechanisms of angular momentum transport are thus required. In this framework, our aim is to investigate the possibility that mixed modes extract angular momentum from the inner radiative regions of evolved low-mass stars. To this end, we consider the transformed Eulerian mean (TEM) formalism, which allows us to consider the combined effect of both the <b>wave</b> momentum <b>flux</b> in the mean angular momentum equation and the <b>wave</b> heat <b>flux</b> in the mean entropy equation as well as their interplay with the meridional circulation. In radiative layers of evolved low-mass stars, the quasi-adiabatic approximation, the limit of slow rotation, and the asymptotic regime can be applied for mixed modes and enable us to establish a prescription for the <b>wave</b> <b>fluxes</b> in the mean equations. The formalism is finally applied to a 1. 3 M⊙ benchmark model, representative of observed CoRoT and Kepler oscillating evolved stars. We show that the influence of the <b>wave</b> heat <b>flux</b> on the mean angular momentum is not negligible and that the overall effect of mixed modes is to extract angular momentum from the innermost region of the star.

It {{appears to be the}} first time that both suspended sediment size and concentration have been obtained in the ocean from acoustic profiling data. The inversion method for data analysis is based on a semi-empirical expression for the scattering cross section of sand. Straight stainless steel wires are used as standard targets to determine the acoustic sounder sensitivities. Laboratory measurements, with a suspended sediment jet, and four periods of field measurements from Stanhope Beach, Prince Edward Island are analysed. It is demonstrated that in the laboratory measurements the systematic error is about + 12 % in concentration, and about - 19 % in size. The RASTRAN concentration data from the field experiments are in reasonably good agreement with Optical Backscattering Sensor (OBS) measurements at the same height above bottom. The time-mean profiles of particle concentration for the four selected field runs follow a power law in the nearbed region, above which the concentration profile can be expressed mainly by an exponential function. Suspended particle sizes are more uniform than concentration in the vertical. Both size and concentration profiles vary significantly with the wave energy level. The vertical profile of sediment eddy diffusivity Ks is calculated from the time-mean profiles of particle concentration and size by assuming a balance on average between vertical diffusion and settling. It is shown that the sediment eddy diffusivity is a linear function of height in the nearbed region, then decreases slightly with height. It is demonstrated that the horizontal <b>wave</b> <b>flux</b> affects the total suspended sediment transport, while the vertical <b>wave</b> <b>flux</b> has important effects on the vertical profiles of sediment eddy diffusivity.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that {{magnetic}} fields {{play an important role in}} the stability of molecular clouds, mainly perpendicularly to the field direction. However, in the parallel direction the stability is a serious problem still to be explained. Interstellar turbulence may allow the generation of Alfvén waves that propagate through the clouds in the magnetic field direction. These regions also present great amounts of dust particles which can give rise to new wave modes, or modify the pre-existing ones. The dust-cyclotron damping affects the Alfvén wave propagation near the dust- cyclotron frequency. On the other hand, the clouds present different grain sizes, which carry different charges. In this sense, a dust particle distribution has several dust-cyclotron frequencies and it will affect a broad band of wave frequencies. In this case, the energy transfer to the gas is more efficient than in the case where the ion-cyclotron damping is considered alone. This effect becomes more important if a power law spectrum is considered for the <b>wave</b> energy <b>flux,</b> since the major part of the energy is concentrated in low-frequency waves. In this work we calculate the dust- cyclotron damping in a dusty and magnetized dwarf molecular cloud, as well as determine the changes in the Alfvén <b>wave</b> <b>flux.</b> Then, we use these results to study the gravitational stability of the cloud. We show that, considering the presence of charged dust particles, the <b>wave</b> <b>flux</b> is rapidly damped due to dust-cyclotron damping.
