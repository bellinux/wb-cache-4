5|$|On 31 December 1888, {{his body}} was found {{floating}} in the River Thames, off Thornycroft's torpedo works, Chiswick, by a waterman named Henry Winslade. Stones in Druitt's pockets had kept his body submerged for about a month. He was {{in possession of a}} return train ticket to Hammersmith dated 1 December, a silver watch, a cheque for £50 and £16 in gold (equivalent to £ and £ today). It is not known <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have carried such a large amount of money, {{but it could have been}} a final payment from the school.|$|E
5|$|Dodd {{spent most}} of December in Iowa engaged in Town Halls. He briefly made a trip to Mountain View, California to make a speech before {{returning}} to the trails in Iowa. He participated in the last Democratic Debate before the primary season on December 13 in Johnson, Iowa. In this debate sponsored by the Des Moines Register, Dodd commented that Education was the most important issue to him in the campaign. He also made a statement on why he felt he was the best choice for president and <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> receive the endorsement of the Des Moines Register, which ultimately went to Hillary Clinton.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Bakshi reread J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye, {{which he}} had first read in high school, and saw {{parallels}} between his situation {{and that of the}} book's protagonist, Holden Caulfield. Inspired to seek the film rights, he intended to shoot the story's bracketing sequences in live action and to animate the core flashback scenes. Salinger had rejected previous offers to adapt the novel, and had not made a public appearance since 1965 or granted an interview since 1980. Bakshi sent Salinger a letter explaining <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be allowed to adapt the novel; the writer responded by thanking Bakshi and asserting that the novel was unfit for any medium other than its original form.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} year Soegija asked {{to join the}} Catholic-education classes, citing a desire to fully use the facilities at Xaverius. His teacher, Father Mertens, told Soegija that he required permission from his parents first; although they refused, Soegija was nevertheless allowed to study Catholicism. He was intrigued by the Trinity, and asked several of the priests for clarification. Van Lith cited the works of Thomas Aquinas, while Mertens discussed the Trinity as explained by Augustine of Hippo; the latter told him that humans were not meant to understand God with their limited knowledge. Soegija, who wanted to learn more, asked to be baptised, quoting the Finding in the Temple to show <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> not need his parents' permission. The priests agreed, and Soegija was baptised on 24December 1910, taking the baptismal name Albertus, for Albertus Magnus. During Christmas holidays, he told his family that he had converted. Although his immediate family eventually accepted this, and may have eventually supported him, Soegija's other relatives refused {{to speak to him}} afterwards.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of season three, another 90-minute {{retrospective}} aired in which Jessica says goodbye to Benson, using the flashback clips {{to try to explain}} <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> stay. This show also served to help launch the spinoff Benson, which was premiering at {{the start of}} the 1979–80 season.|$|E
25|$|On the 1950–51 tour, Brown {{allowed the}} team to socialise more than {{previous}} captains had done and saw no reason <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> insist that amateur undergraduates should mix awkwardly with working class professionals, or that veterans should accompany their younger teammates. This led to the usual stories of dissension in the ranks when a team performs badly and Brown hotly denied this.|$|E

25|$|Sallust {{struck out}} {{practically}} {{a new line}} in literature for himself: his predecessors had been little better than mere dry-as-dust chroniclers, but he endeavoured to explain the connection and meaning of events and successfully delineated character. The contrast between his early life and the high moral tone he adopted in his writings has frequently made him a subject of reproach, but history gives no reason <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> not have reformed.|$|E
25|$|On 10 October 2009, Farina {{was arrested}} by Queensland Police for Driving under the influence. He was {{initially}} suspended by the Roar and asked to show cause as to <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> not be sacked for tarnishing {{the name of the}} club. It was announced that assistant manager, Rado Vidošić would step into a caretakers role until a decision had been made which would include the M1 Derby, which the Roar lost 1–0 at home. Farina was ultimately sacked on 14 October 2009, with the club tasked with finding a replacement {{for the remainder of the}} 2009–10 season.|$|E
25|$|With {{only one}} game before the First Test Brown's men had {{to improve their}} form {{dramatically}} {{if they wanted to}} stand a chance against the powerful Australian team. Instead they conceded another first innings deficit to a weak Sheffield Shield team. the wicket-keeper-captain Don Tallon won the toss and batted and the MCC bowlers did quite well in the circumstances, Alec Bedser (3/40) and John Warr (3/70) having Queensland 23/2, but whatever good work they did was undone by slack fielding, poor catching and some new batsman making runs. Ken Archer (63), who would make his Test debut in the series added 120 with Aubrey Carrigan (100) and Ernest Toovey (58 not out) added 81 for the ninth wicket with Lawrence Chapman (38). The second day was rained off as they batted into the third day for 305. The local swing bowler Len Johnson took 6/66 in an innings of 291 that relied almost entirely on Cyril Washbrook (82) and John Dewes (117), both fighting their way back into form and jeered by the crowd as they ground out their unsightly innings. With Denis Compton making a dull 28 in 100 minutes and nobody else making 15 by the time they had finished only three overs could be bowled before stumps, but Warr picked up a wicket for no runs. The press were unsympathetic and with rumours that Hutton (damaged finger), Denis Compton (swollen knee) and Alec Bedser (influenza) were all ill or injured some wondered if the Test was worth playing. There were also the usual stories of dissension in the ranks whenever a team performs badly, which Brown hotly denied, thus providing a new story. In truth Brown ran a happy ship and allowed the team more socialising than previous captains. He also saw no reason <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> force amateur undergraduates to mix awkwardly with working class professionals, or that veterans should accompany their younger team-mates.|$|E

500|$|Plots {{during the}} first ten [...] "boy and his dog" [...] seasons were similar: the boy (Jeff or Timmy) got {{into some sort of}} trouble. Lassie then dashed off to get help or rushed in to save her master's life herself. After being reunited with family and {{breathing}} a sigh of relief, the boy received a light lecture on <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> not have done what he had done. In 2004, June Lockhart described the show as [...] "...a fairy tale about people on a farm in which the dog solves all the problems in 22 minutes, in time for the last commercial." ...|$|E
500|$|The law in Wales at {{that time}} {{permitted}} condemned men to atone for their crimes by making a payment to their victims. Cragh's friends and family rallied round to offer 100 cows to deBriouze for his release, but the offer was refused. The substantial scale of the proposed compensation indicates that Cragh was an important man, although some witnesses described him as a thief rather than a rebel. Historian Jussi Hanska has suggested that de Briouze's refusal to accept the offer strengthens the case for Cragh being a rebel, {{as there is no}} other convincing reason to explain <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have opted to [...] "decline good income just to hang a thief".|$|E
500|$|In October 1875 Edward {{set off for}} India on an {{extensive}} eight-month tour of the sub-continent. His advisors remarked on his habit of treating all people the same, regardless of their social station or colour. In letters home, he complained of {{the treatment of the}} native Indians by the British officials: [...] "Because a man has a black face and a different religion from our own, there is no reason <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be treated as a brute." [...] Consequently, Lord Salisbury, the Secretary of State for India, issued new guidance and at least one resident was removed from office. At the end of the tour, Queen Victoria was given the title Empress of India by Parliament, in part {{as a result of the}} tour's success.|$|E

Only seventy-one, only seventy-one.’ At length his lady has quite concluded, and then <b>he</b> says, <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>he</b> repine, <b>why</b> <b>should</b> <b>he</b> give way, <b>why</b> <b>should</b> <b>he</b> suffer his heart to sink within him?

This led to Edge approaching Randy Orton and asking him to join forces with him to [...] "get rid of DX". In his stand, Edge explained to Orton <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> join him as a tag team partner, as he cited Orton's lack of success after being kicked out of Evolution (Orton's former group), as well as the antics of DX taking up TV time that he felt should rightfully go to the younger stars.|$|E
500|$|When the {{completed}} album was played for an assembled group of executives at Columbia's headquarters in California, several were reportedly unimpressed {{by what they}} heard. [...] Matters had not been helped when Columbia Records offered Waters smaller publishing rights {{on the grounds that}} The Wall was a double album, a position he did not accept. When one executive offered to settle the dispute with a coin toss, Waters asked <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> gamble on something he owned. He eventually prevailed. The record company's concerns were alleviated when [...] "Another Brick in the Wall Part 2" [...] reached number one in the UK, US, Norway, Portugal, Israel, West Germany and South Africa. It was certified platinum in the UK in December 1979, and platinum in the US three months later.|$|E
500|$|Zack Handlen, {{while writing}} for The A.V. Club in 2009, said that Whitney was a [...] "competent actress", but that Rand [...] "represents some of Treks most egregious offenses against feminism". He criticized her role within the show, and {{specifically}} in [...] "Charlie X" [...] when Charlie slaps her bottom {{and none of}} the characters can explain <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> not do that. Michelle Erica Green praised the [...] "substantial" [...] role given to Rand in [...] "Flashback" [...] while writing for TrekNation, adding that {{this was the first time}} such a role had been given to the character in the franchise. However, she criticized Rand's being written out part way through the episode as she felt that the character could have had more to contribute to the plot.|$|E

500|$|The tower's {{public spaces}} are clad in Breccia Pernice, a pink white-veined marble. Four gold-painted {{elevators}} transport visitors from the lobby to higher floors; a dedicated elevator leads {{directly to the}} penthouse where the Trump family lives. Mirrors and brass are used throughout the well-furnished apartments and the kitchens are outfitted with [...] "standard suburban" [...] cabinets. The building contains thirteen office floors on levels 14 to 26, then another 39 condominium floors containing 263 condominiums on levels 30–68. Trump later stated that he had placed the first residential floor on the level numbered 30 {{as part of a}} marketing strategy for all of his towers, and that he [...] "did not see <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be forced to call the first residential floor something mundane like the second floor, or even the 20th floor". Many of the apartments are furnished, but some of the upper-floor commercial spaces come unfurnished.|$|E
500|$|In July 2013, a mid-credits scene teasing X-Men: Days of Future Past was {{attached}} to the theatrical release of The Wolverine. The scene, set two years after the events of The Wolverine, depicts Wolverine going through an airport security checkpoint while a commercial for Trask Industries plays in the background. Suddenly, Wolverine notices that all the metal objects around him start to shake and levitate. He turns around to see Magneto, who says he needs Wolverine's help to combat a threat to all mutants. When Wolverine asks Magneto <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> trust him, the people around them freeze as Xavier approaches Wolverine and assures him that Magneto is telling the truth. Adam Pockross of Yahoo! Movies described the mid-credits scene as the coolest part of The Wolverine and wrote, [...] "Boom!

500|$|In October 1996, {{the group}} rented a mansion in Rancho Santa Fe, California. That year, they {{recorded}} two video messages {{in which they}} offered their viewers a [...] "last chance to evacuate Earth". Around the same time, they learned of the approach of Comet Hale–Bopp. Applewhite now believed that Nettles was aboard a spaceship trailing the comet, and that she planned to rendezvous with them. He told his followers that the vessel would transport them to an empyrean destination, {{and that there was}} a government conspiracy to suppress word of the craft. In addition, he stated that his deceased followers would be taken by the vessel as well, a belief that resembled the Christian pretribulation rapture doctrine. It is not known how he learned of the comet or why he believed that it was accompanied by extraterrestrials or <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have believed the dead Nettles would be with them.|$|E

It was a time of festival, those gates were ill-guarded. <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>he</b> not force them at the dead of night, make his way to the palace, cause Pharaoh to be gathered to his fathers, and at the dawn discover himself seated upon Pharaoh's throne? At the thought of it Abi's heart leapt in his breast, his wide nostrils spread themselves, and he erected his strong head as though already he felt upon it the weight of the double crown. Then he turned and walked back to the pavilion.|$|R
