5|$|Changing the reflux (in {{combination}} {{with changes in}} feed and product withdrawal) {{can also be used}} to improve the separation properties of a continuous distillation column while in operation (in contrast to adding plates or trays, or changing the packing, which <b>would,</b> <b>at</b> a minimum, require quite significant downtime).|$|E
5|$|Destroying this {{symbol of}} British naval power {{by means of}} a {{submarine}} <b>would</b> <b>at</b> least be a blow to British morale and, perhaps, threaten the British blockade and control of New York Harbor. The plan was to have Lee surface just behind Eagles rudder and use a screw to attach an explosive to the ship’s hull. Once attached, Lee would re-enter the water and make his getaway.|$|E
5|$|Without the Polish assistance, British cryptologists <b>would,</b> <b>at</b> {{the very}} least, have been {{considerably}} delayed in reading Enigma. Hugh Sebag-Montefiore concludes that substantial breaks into German Army and Air Force Enigma ciphers by the British {{would have occurred}} only after November 1941 at the earliest, after an Enigma machine and key lists had been captured, and similarly into Naval Enigma only after late 1942.|$|E

5|$|Aronofsky's debut feature, Pi, {{also written}} as π, {{was shot in}} November 1997. The film was financed in part from $100 {{donations}} from friends and family. In return, he promised to pay each back $150 if the film made money, and they <b>would</b> <b>at</b> least get screen credit if the film lost money. Producing the film with an initial budget of $60,000, Aronofsky premiered Pi at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival, where he won the Best Director award. The film itself {{was nominated for a}} special Jury Award. Artisan Entertainment bought distribution rights for $1 million. The film was released to the public later that year to critical acclaim and it grossed a total of $3,221,152 at the box-office. Pi was the first film to be made available for download on the Internet.|$|E
5|$|Dworkin {{later wrote}} that she {{eventually}} {{agreed to help}} smuggle a briefcase of heroin through customs in return for $1,000 and an airplane ticket, thinking that if she was successful she could return home with the ticket and the money, and if caught she <b>would</b> <b>at</b> least escape her ex-husband's abuse by going to prison. The deal for the briefcase fell through, but {{the man who had}} promised Dworkin the money gave her the airline ticket anyway, and she returned to the United States in 1972.|$|E
5|$|Déby {{attempted}} {{to reconcile the}} rebel groups and reintroduced multiparty politics. Chadians approved a new constitution by referendum, and in 1996, Déby easily won a competitive presidential election. He won a second term five years later. Oil exploitation began in Chad in 2003, bringing with it hopes that Chad <b>would</b> <b>at</b> last have some chances of peace and prosperity. Instead, internal dissent worsened, and a new civil war broke out. Déby unilaterally modified the constitution to remove the two-term limit on the presidency; this caused an uproar among the civil society and opposition parties.|$|E

5|$|However, Kalt {{argues that}} the Vicinage Clause might permit a variety of prosecutorial {{strategies}} that <b>would</b> <b>at</b> least partially close this loophole. First, the government {{might be able to}} charge other crimes that did not occur exclusively within the Idaho portion of the park (for example, if the defendant(s) conspired elsewhere). Second, the government could charge crimes for which the maximum authorized sentence is six months or less, to which the jury right does not attach. Third, the Clause might permit the government to encourage potential jurors to move into the Idaho portion of the park after the crime. Fourth, the government might argue for a purposive, rather than textualist, interpretation of the Clause by arguing that a jury drawn from elsewhere could satisfy the purposes of the Clause. Kalt also notes that the Vicinage Clause would not protect against civil liability or vigilante justice.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{two nations}} were still working at cross-purposes. The British saw the IRBMs as a step {{on the path to}} an {{independent}} nuclear deterrent, while the Americans saw it as an augmentation of the Strategic Air Command (SAC). The Americans originally envisaged the employment of 120 Thor missiles in four USAF squadrons, the 672nd, 673rd, 674th and 675th Strategic Missile Squadrons, and four RAF squadrons, the first two of which <b>would</b> <b>at</b> first be manned by USAF personnel. The October 1957 Sputnik crisis caused this plan to be modified. It placed the Eisenhower administration under great public pressure to act on the deployment of missiles by a shocked and distraught nation. Sputnik demonstrated the Soviet Union's capability to deploy ICBMs. The United States now needed the IRBMs—and British cooperation—more than ever. The proposal to base USAF Thor squadrons in Britain was dropped on 12 October 1957.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-2000s, German sect experts {{expressed}} concerns that Scientologists were becoming {{active in the}} German after-school tutoring market. These concerns arose because customers of around 20 after-school tutoring centres operated by Scientologists in Frankfurt, Hamburg, Stuttgart and elsewhere might be unaware that their children were being taught by Scientologists, using Scientology methods. Brochures advertising the tutoring services <b>would</b> <b>at</b> most mention the name of L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology, but not Scientology itself.|$|E

5000|$|The {{strategy}} proved highly successful, and FC quickly outgrew {{its original}} facility. Thus, it {{moved across the}} parking lot to the nearby Irving Arts Center. During this time, FC tried the concept of [...] "simultaneous services"—one group <b>would</b> meet <b>at</b> FC's facility while another <b>would</b> meet <b>at</b> the Arts Center. The FC music team <b>would</b> play <b>at</b> one site while Young preached at the other, then midway through the services the teams would switch places. The concept proved unsuccessful and was shortly dropped.|$|R
5|$|Like the Shieldings’ lookout, {{one made}} {{guardian}} of the gateway to Lejre {{would have had to}} be trusted, and perhaps connected to the king by family or loyalty; the guardian <b>would</b> <b>at</b> least occupy an important position in the military hierarchy. Adornments like the Gevninge helmet fragment would have served to identify the rank of such a person, adding decoration to a helmet meant for more than just protection.|$|E
5|$|Specimens {{that have}} been {{identified}} by morphology as Beringian wolves (C.lupus) and radiocarbon dated 25,800–14,300 YBP {{have been found in}} the Natural Trap Cave {{at the base of the}} Bighorn Mountains in Wyoming, in the western United States. The location is directly south of what <b>would</b> <b>at</b> that time have been a division between the Laurentide Ice Sheet and the Cordilleran Ice Sheet. A temporary channel between the glaciers may have existed that allowed these large, Alaskan direct competitors of the dire wolf, which were also adapted for preying on megafauna, to come south of the ice sheets. Dire wolves were absent north of 42°Nlatitude in the Late Pleistocene; therefore, this region would have been available for Beringian wolves to expand south along the glacier line. How widely they were then distributed is not known. These also became extinct at the end of the Late Pleistocene, as did the dire wolf.|$|E
5|$|Texian {{survivors}} of the Battle of Coleto Creek believed their surrender agreement with Urrea <b>would,</b> <b>at</b> worst, mean their deportation. Santa Anna, however, adhered to the 1835 Tornel Decree that stated the insurrection {{was an act of}} piracy fomented by the United States, and ordered their executions. Although he personally disagreed with the need to do so, Urrea carried out his commander's orders on March 27. Of the estimated 370 Texians being held, a few managed to escape the massacre. The remainder were shot, stabbed with bayonets and lances and clubbed with gun butts. Fannin was shot through the face and his gold watch stolen. The dead were cremated on a pyre.|$|E

5|$|The {{economy of}} England in the Middle Ages, from the Norman {{invasion}} in 1066, {{to the death}} of HenryVII in 1509, was fundamentally agricultural, though even before the invasion the market economy was important to producers. Norman institutions, including serfdom, were superimposed on an existing system of open fields and mature, well-established towns involved in international trade. Over the next five centuries the economy <b>would</b> <b>at</b> first grow and then suffer an acute crisis, resulting in significant political and economic change. Despite economic dislocation in urban and extraction economies, including shifts in the holders of wealth and the location of these economies, the economic output of towns and mines developed and intensified over the period. By the end of the period, England had a weak government, by later standards, overseeing an economy dominated by rented farms controlled by gentry, and a thriving community of indigenous English merchants and corporations.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} the kingdom of the East Angles can be {{determined}} from a variety of sources. Isolated to the north and east by the North Sea, there were mainly impenetrable forests to the south and the swamps and scattered islands of the Fens on its western border. The main land route from East Anglia <b>would</b> <b>at</b> that time have been a land corridor, along which ran the prehistoric Icknield Way. The southern neighbours of the East Angles were the East Saxons and across {{the other side of the}} Fens were the Middle Angles. It has been suggested that the Devil's Dyke (near modern Newmarket) at one time formed part of the kingdom's western boundary, but as its construction can only be dated from between the 4th and 10th centuries, it cannot be established to be of Early Anglo-Saxon origin.|$|E

5|$|Upon the {{outbreak}} of war, gout began to cause Battenberg considerable pain, and the naval staff he had set up did not function {{as well as it}} ought to have done. On 6 August 1914 Battenberg and the French Deputy Chief of Staff of the Navy Antoine Schwerer signed a convention in London on the division of responsibilities between the two navies. The convention confirmed the terms of the Entente Cordiale, and placed France in command of all naval operations in the Mediterranean. Malta and Gibraltar would both be treated as French naval bases. In the event that Austria entered the war France would act against its naval forces, and <b>would</b> <b>at</b> minimum prevent them passing the Strait of Otranto.|$|E
5|$|Victorious Boxers {{does not}} use a damage or life meter. Instead, visible damage {{can be seen on}} a boxer's face, which is most {{noticeable}} between rounds when the characters are sitting in their corners. The amount of damage taken is reflected by bruises, swelling, and black eyes on the characters' faces. Another sign of damage is the characters' speed of movement throughout the fight. The characters begin to move slower and the controls become less responsive to simulate fatigue. The more a boxer is hit or uses special moves, the more their stamina is affected. Distance is a factor in determining a punch's damage. For example, a jab thrown while next to an opponent will not do as much damage as it <b>would</b> <b>at</b> arms length. Also, right hooks do not do as much damage if the character is positioned to the opponent's left and vice versa.|$|E
