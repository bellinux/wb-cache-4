This paper presents a method for easy and quick generation of the max-plus equations for manufacturing flow lines of any size or structure. The generated equations can model flow lines with infinite as well as finite buffer sizes. A flow line to be modeled is initially assumed to have infinite buffers for all stations. The line model equations are then generated as a combination of serial and merging stations after identifying the different stages using an adjacency matrix for the flow line. In the generated equations, the dynamics of the system are captured in two matrices that are function of the processing times of the different stations in the line. After generating these equations, extra terms are added to account for the finite buffers where for each buffer size, a matrix is added multiplied by the vector of system parameters delayed by the buffer size plus one. The method is intuitive and easy to understand and code in software and thus can facilitate quick analysis of different configurations of manufacturing flow lines and assessing <b>what</b> <b>if</b> <b>scenarios.</b> This can also allow quick on-line reconfiguration of controllers for frequently reconfiguring flow lines...|$|R

Unfortunately, existing knowledge regarding demonstrations is composed of partial qualitative descriptions without complete and precise numerical information. In this paper we describe a first attempt to use qualitative reasoning techniques to model demonstrations. To our knowledge, such techniques have never been applied to modeling and reasoning regarding crowd behaviors, nor in particular demonstrations. We develop qualitative models consistent with the partial, qualitative social science literature, allowing us to model the interactions between different factors that influence violence in demonstrations. We then utilize qualitative simulation to predict the potential eruption of violence, at various levels, based on a description of the demographics, environmental settings, and police responses. We incrementally present and compare three such qualitative models. The results show that while two of these models fail to predict the outcomes of real-world events reported and analyzed in the literature, one model provide good results. We also examine whether a popular machine learning algorithm (decision tree learning) can be used. While the results show that the decision trees provide improved predictions, we show that the QR models can be more sensitive to changes, and can account for <b>what</b> <b>if</b> <b>scenarios,</b> in contrast to decision trees. Moreover, we introduce a novel analysis algorithm which analyzes the QR simulations, to automatically determine the factors that are most important in influencing the outcome in specific real-world demonstrations.

40|$|In {{the last}} ten years or so, many {{interactive}} aircraft design software packages have been released into the market. One drawback of these packages is that they assume prior knowledge in the field of aircraft design. Also, their main purpose being the preliminary aircraft design in a commercial environment, and are not intended for instructional use. Aircraft Design is an iterative process, and the students in the formative years of training must realise that one year of study is not enough to embrace all the necessary underlying concepts in this field. Most universities present the aircraft design as a classical Problem-Based Learning scenario, where students work in groups, with the group size varying between 5 and 8 students., each with a designated role, to carry out a specific task. The students work through the classical process of preliminary design based largely on textbook methods. Therefore, the need for a preliminary design tool (software) that helps the students to understand, analyse, and evaluate their aircraft design process exists. The developed software does everything that is needed in the preliminary design environment. Students are interactively guided through the design process, in a manner that facilitates lifelong learning. Comprehensive output is provided to highlight the ???<b>what</b> <b>if</b> <b>scenarios???.</b> The software consists of many modules such as input (user interface), weight estimation, flight performance, cost estimation, take-off analysis, parametric studies, optimisation, and dynamic stability. Due to the large number of input design variables, a full interactive Graphical-User-Interface (GUI) is developed to enable students to evaluate their designs quickly. Object-Oriented-Programming (OOP) is used to create the GUI environment. The stability and control derivatives computed in this work are largely based on analytical techniques. However, a facility is provided in the software to create the data input file required to run a software package produced by USAF, called DATCOM, that enables computation of the dynamic stability and control derivatives that can be ultimately used in flight simulation work.

40|$|In recent years, {{with only}} small {{fractions}} of modern processors now accessible {{in a single}} cycle, computer architects constantly fight against propagation issues across the die. Unfortunately this trend continues to shift inward, and now the even most internal features of the pipeline are designed around communication, not computation. To address the inward creep of this constraint, this work focuses on the characterization of communication within the pipeline itself, architectural techniques to avoid it when possible, and layout co-design for early detection of problems. I present work in creating a novel detection tool for common case operand movement which can rapidly characterize an applications dataflow patterns. The results produced are suitable for exploitation as {{a small number of}} patterns can describe a significant portion of modern applications. Work on dynamic dependence collapsing takes the observations from the pattern results and shows how certain groups of operations can be dynamically grouped, avoiding unnecessary communication between individual instructions. This technique also amplifies the efficiency of pipeline data structures such as the reorder buffer, increasing both IPC and frequency. I also identify the same sets of collapsible instructions at compile time, producing the same benefits with minimal hardware complexity. This technique is also done in a backward compatible manner as the groups are exposed by simple reordering of the binarys instructions. I present aggressive pipelining approaches for these resources which avoids the critical timing often presumed necessary in aggressive superscalar processors. As these structures are designed for the worst case, pipelining them can produce greater frequency benefit than IPC loss. I also use the observation that the dynamic issue order for instructions in aggressive superscalar processors is predictable. Thus, a hardware mechanism is introduced for caching the wakeup order for groups of instructions efficiently. These wakeup vectors are then used to speculatively schedule instructions, avoiding the dynamic scheduling when it is not necessary. Finally, I present a novel approach to fast and high-quality chip layout. By allowing architects to quickly evaluate <b>what</b> <b>if</b> <b>scenarios</b> during early high-level design, chip designs are less likely to encounter implementation problems later in the process.

40|$|Recognition of the {{complexity}} of many public health problems has led to the search for analytic methods capable of capturing more fully than traditional study designs and statistical tests the underlying dynamic processes at work. Similarly, those with an interest in public health interventions have begun to see the limitations of standard methods in understanding the consequences of programs and policies designed to influence population-level health. While {{there are a number of}} system science methods with potential to further public health research, there are three methods most often applied: agent-based modeling, social network analysis, and system dynamics modeling. The first discussion reviews both theoretical and practical applications of these three methods in the literature, as each has strengths and weaknesses and is better suited to studying some aspects of complex dynamic phenomena than others. Such a discussion provides practical guidance for those who wish to use these system methods in their own research. Following this, there is a discussion of different perspectives on how these methods relate to traditional behavioral research methods, and how these perspectives affect understanding of and explanation of public health problems. Beginning with a detailed analysis of the three systems methods used in public health and following with a discussion of how different perspectives affect understanding of public health problems sets the stage for the development of a systems model of a complex public health problem. The final section applies these lessons by developing and testing a system dynamics model of type 2 diabetes in the area known as Health Service Region 11. The model framed the problem of diabetes in this region using assumptions implicit within selecting a system dynamics model. The focus was on the effectiveness of physical activity interventions to guide decision-makers in future resource allocation and public health professionals to use appropriate methodologies for complex health problems that traditional linear approaches are unable to capture and thus unable to suggest informed routes for change. The model evaluated different ?<b>what</b> <b>if?</b> <b>scenarios</b> of prevention and intervention strategies for reducing prevalence of (and ultimately incidence of) type 2 diabetes...|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis is aimed at developing a very comprehensive system of manufacturing wire splices for automobile wire harnesses. Ultrasonic welding is increasingly being used in various industrial applications. Lack of a scientific data-base of its properties when applied to wire splicing is {{a major reason for}} lack of proper usage by the wiring harness industry and its subsequent acceptance by the end user. This thesis presents various experiments conducted to develop tensile strengths and electrical resistances of various types of ultrasonically welded wire splices. Crimping technology was evaluated for its mechanical strengths and electrical properties by conducting various experiments {{to make it possible for}} the industry to compare it with other alternative splicing technologies. The results are then compared with ultrasonic welding. The next stage of this thesis discusses the economic feasibility of ultrasonic wire splicing. In order to find the number of ultrasonic welding machines required to meet a particular level of demand, which is a prerequisite for establishing the economic feasibility, a virtual model of the process and the manufacturing cell has been prepared and this model was used to study the dynamics of demand and the number of required machines. Simulation in manufacturing-problem-solving is being used very widely by researchers. Proper understanding and visualisation of the future of the factory and understanding and answering various questions related to the adoption of new technology, is another major reason why companies shy away from adopting ultrasonic welding systems. An advanced simulation tool namely QUEST was used to model the wire splice manufacturing cell of Alcatel and simulation studies were conducted to foresee how the production dynamics would be if ultrasonic welding machines were incorporated in place of crimping machines and various <b>what</b> <b>if</b> <b>scenarios</b> were developed and some vital production related questions were answered. Material handling is a major bottleneck in any wiring harness manufacturing environment. Some conceptual designs are presented on automating the task of feeding wires to ultrasonic welding machines and transferring the wire assemblies from welding stations to different work stations, currently being done manually. A wire palletising system was designed to improve the productivity. This thesis concludes that ultrasonic welding could be very effectively used for wire splicing and could be safely used in the manufacture of wiring harnesses for the automobile industry...|$|R
40|$|The ethos behind green {{building}} development {{is to create}} facilities that must minimise waste and energy use throughout their life cycle stages. One paradigm behind the design of {{green building}}s is the focus on selecting material and design solutions based on durability/reliability and longevity performance criteria. Furthermore, the endeavour behind the investment in green buildings is to improve life cycle operation performance through the reduction of energy, water use, waste, and operation and maintenance costs. There is emerging {{evidence to suggest that}} the operational performance of green buildings has a significant impact on their rental and market value. Therefore, considering operational features during the early stages of value planning will probably {{go a long way to}} protect and increase the value of investment in green real estate by taking into consideration risks and initiatives to improve the energy efficiency and sustainability of assets throughout their entire life cycle. In this study, it is deemed important that both tangible and intangible value creation processes and drivers should be explored in the quest for value creation in green building development. A combination of literature sources identified the value drivers that were reported to be important for value creation in green building development and a list of risks that may have a negative impact on value created by green building design. In total, 66 risk factors and 98 value drivers were identified which are split between five homogenous groups. The list of value drivers and risk factors were used to develop a questionnaire to assess their effectiveness in value creation. Both qualitative and quantitative approaches were used in this research. The literature review has been used to synthesise existing knowledge to identify gaps in knowledge in the proposed research area and to confirm and articulate the research questions and objectives. A hand-delivered survey was used as the main method for data collection. The questionnaire was designed and then tested on a small sample of academics to make sure the questions were correctly understood. The participants were selected randomly from a pool of experts who are knowledgeable about value engineering analysis in Saudi Arabia construction industry. The developed value creation framework and associated assessment risk and value tools are usable at the early stages of preparing a business case and design for developing green buildings. The framework and tools can be used to assist in sustainability and value for money analysis. The value generated from investment in green buildings will hinge on the level of value creation strategies inducted into the project brief and on the perceived risks from not including some of the value generating strategies. In addition, the proposed generic framework provides appropriate opportunities for the stakeholders to assess value and risk impacts before the actual construction starts. It will provide a cheap alternative simulation environment for testing <b>what</b> <b>if</b> <b>scenarios.</b> Although value drivers and risks are mainly derived for green building assets, as commonalities across similar building projects exists, this will provide appropriate opportunities for this research to be utilised in other building types as well. In addition, the study has attempted to elicit value creation drivers that can be used to aid value engineering analysis become a usable tool that assists in unlocking value in the development of green buildings. The risks that challenge the destruction of value are also considered for adoption into a practical tool. This is achieved in part by defining the drivers that contribute to value creation and in part by defining the risks that may have an impact on realising the identified value...|$|R

By combining our realworld capacity results with this analytical model, we find new insight in to the tradeoffs between conjugate and zeroforcing precoding. Our results suggest that conjugate will outperform zero-forcing when there are many simultaneous users, the users have high mobility, or the implementation employs less-capable hardware.
