5|$|The 5 o'clock <b>wave</b> <b>is</b> {{a fictional}} theory on {{the reasons for}} Wagga Wagga's {{sporting}} success. According to the local urban myth, at precisely 5 o'clock arrives a giant wave which flushes a secret nutrient into the Murrumbidgee River following the release {{of water from the}} Blowering and Burrinjuck Dams. The <b>wave</b> <b>is</b> said to continue down river at high speed, and indeed visitors are told it is so powerful that surfers can ride it along the meandering river until it reaches the town of Narrandera.|$|E
5|$|The {{rarefaction}} {{is reflected}} off the sloping end {{wall of the}} clarinet mouthpiece. The opening between the reed and the mouthpiece makes very little difference to {{the reflection of the}} rarefaction wave. This is because the opening is very small compared {{to the size of the}} tube, so almost the entire <b>wave</b> <b>is</b> reflected back down the tube even if the reed is completely open at the time the wave hits (image 3).|$|E
5|$|Within a few seconds, a {{substantial}} {{fraction of the}} matter in the white dwarf undergoes nuclear fusion, releasing enough energy (1–) to unbind the star in a supernova. An outwardly expanding shock <b>wave</b> <b>is</b> generated, with matter reaching velocities {{on the order of}} 5,000–20,000km/s, or roughly 3% of the speed of light. There is also a significant increase in luminosity, reaching an absolute magnitude of −19.3 (or 5 billion times brighter than the Sun), with little variation.|$|E
50|$|Radio <b>Waves</b> <b>is</b> a {{radio station}} in Bhutan. It is {{currently}} being run by Kelzang Thinley. It is located in Thimphu, just below Chubachu. The languages used by Radio <b>Waves</b> <b>are</b> Dzongkha and English. The frequency of Radio <b>waves</b> <b>is</b> 88.8 and it was formed in December 10, 2010.|$|R

50|$|When {{ultrasonic}} <b>waves</b> <b>are</b> {{generated in}} a liquid in a rectangular vessel, the <b>wave</b> can <b>be</b> reflected {{from the walls}} of the vessel. These reflected <b>waves</b> <b>are</b> called echoes. The direct and reflected <b>waves</b> <b>are</b> superimposed causing a standing <b>wave</b> to <b>be</b> formed. The density of the liquid at a node is more than the density at an antinode. Hence, the liquid acts as a diffraction grating to a parallel beam of light passed through the liquid at right angles to the wave.|$|R
5|$|In {{transparent}} materials, the {{refractive index}} generally {{is greater than}} 1, meaning that the phase velocity is less than c. In other materials, {{it is possible for}} the refractive index to become smaller than 1 for some frequencies; in some exotic materials it is even possible for the index of refraction to become negative. The requirement that causality is not violated implies that the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant of any material, corresponding respectively to the index of refraction and to the attenuation coefficient, are linked by the Kramers–Kronig relations. In practical terms, this means that in a material with refractive index less than 1, the absorption of the <b>wave</b> <b>is</b> so quick that no signal can be sent faster than c.|$|E
5|$|Many humans enjoy {{venturing into}} the sea: {{children}} paddle and splash in the shallows, while others swim or relax on the beach. This {{was not always}} the case, with sea bathing becoming the vogue in Europe in the 18th century after Dr. William Buchan advocated the practice for health reasons. Surfing is a sport in which a <b>wave</b> <b>is</b> ridden by a surfer, {{with or without a}} surfboard. Other water sports include kite surfing, where a power kite propels a manned board across the water; windsurfing, where the power is provided by a fixed, maneuverable sail; and water skiing, where a powerboat is used to pull a skier.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Mitch Benson (Thomas Gibson), the Chief of Operations at Midwest Electric, is {{struggling}} to keep power going to the residents because the six-week heat <b>wave</b> <b>is</b> straining the system and residents are refusing to follow power conservation requests. To get more energy, he {{is working with the}} company's largest supplier, Lexer, but the company's CEO is trying {{to find new ways to}} profit from this crisis. Benson also finds himself caught in a conflict of interest as he is having an affair with the Lexer's public relations representative, Rebecca Kerns (Chandra West).|$|E
50|$|Acoustic <b>waves</b> <b>are</b> {{a type of}} {{longitudinal}} {{waves that}} propagate by means of adiabatic compression and decompression. Longitudinal <b>waves</b> <b>are</b> <b>waves</b> that have the same direction of vibration as their direction of travel. Important quantities for describing acoustic <b>waves</b> <b>are</b> sound pressure, particle velocity, particle displacement and sound intensity. Acoustic waves travel {{with the speed of}} sound which depends on the medium they're passing through.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. An {{analytical}} model of water waves {{generated by the}} wind over the water surface is presented. A simple modeling method of wind <b>waves</b> <b>is</b> described based on waves lengths diagram, azimuthal hodograph of waves velocities and others. Properties of the generated <b>waves</b> <b>are</b> described. The <b>wave</b> length and <b>wave</b> velocity <b>are</b> obtained as functions on azimuth of wave propagation and growth rate. Motionless waves dynamically trapped into the general picture of three dimensional <b>waves</b> <b>are</b> described. The gravitation force does not enter the three dimensional of turbulent wind <b>waves.</b> That <b>is</b> why these <b>waves</b> have turbulent and not gravitational nature. The Langmuir stripes are naturally modeled and existence of the rogue <b>waves</b> <b>is</b> theoretically proved. ...|$|R
30|$|The {{speeds of}} plane <b>waves</b> <b>are</b> {{computed}} by Fortran program of bi-quadratic velocity equation for relevant physical constants of the material. The reflection coefficients of various reflected <b>waves</b> <b>are</b> also computed by Fortran program of Gauss elimination method. The speeds of plane <b>waves</b> <b>are</b> plotted against angle of propagation direction with vertical axis. The reflection coefficients of various reflected <b>waves</b> <b>are</b> plotted against {{the angle of}} incidence. These variations of speeds and reflection coefficients are also compared with those in absence of microstretch parameters.|$|R
5|$|Ocean {{surface waves}} are {{propagating}} oscillations {{caused by the}} drag and friction from air moving {{across the surface of}} the water. This friction transfers energy and forms surface waves in the water more or less in the direction of the wind. The top of a <b>wave</b> <b>is</b> known as its crest and its foot as its trough; the distance between two crests is the wavelength. These waves are mechanical: as they approach, the water at a given point rise up and, as they pass, the water goes down, with parcels of water tracing a roughly circular path. The energy is passed along with the wave at a much greater speed than the motion of the water itself.|$|E
5|$|For a {{transmission}} line carrying sinusoidal waves, {{the phase of}} the reflected <b>wave</b> <b>is</b> continually changing with distance, {{with respect to the}} incident wave, as it proceeds back down the line. Because of this continuous change there are certain points on the line that the reflection will be in phase with the incident wave and the amplitude of the two waves will add. There will be other points where the two waves are in anti-phase and will consequently subtract. At these latter points the amplitude is at a minimum and they are known as nodes. If the incident wave has been totally reflected and the line is lossless, there will be complete cancellation at the nodes with zero signal present there despite the ongoing transmission of waves in both directions. The points where the waves are in phase are anti-nodes and represent a peak in amplitude. Nodes and anti-nodes alternate along the line and the combined wave amplitude varies continuously between them. The combined (incident plus reflected) wave appears to be standing still on the line and is called a standing wave.|$|E
25|$|In case of type A {{pre-excitation}} (left atrioventricular connections), {{a positive}} R <b>wave</b> <b>is</b> seen in V1 ("positive delta") on the precordial leads of the electrocardiogram, while in type B pre-excitation (right atrioventricular connections), a predominantly negative delta <b>wave</b> <b>is</b> seen in lead V1 ("negative delta").|$|E
50|$|The {{next big}} area to {{research}} regarding this topic {{is to understand}} what processes PGO <b>waves</b> <b>are</b> beneficial for in both states of sleep as well as consciousness. Although PGO <b>waves</b> <b>are</b> noticeably present during NREM sleep, some scientists believe they are also present during waking cycles. There {{is a possibility that}} PGO <b>waves</b> <b>are</b> essential for image correction of the eyes, since PGO <b>waves</b> <b>are</b> signals on a pathway that allow the motor cortex of the brain to interface with the vision system.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} how synthetic schlieren may {{be extended to}} measure three-dimensional but axisymmetric internal wave elds. We perform a series of laboratory experiments in which internal <b>waves</b> <b>are</b> generated by a vertically oscillating sphere in uniformly strati ed uid. The <b>waves</b> <b>are</b> again visualised by focusing a camera through the tank upon an image of horizontal black lines and the displacement of lines due to the <b>waves</b> <b>is</b> measured. Assuming the <b>waves</b> <b>are</b> axisymmetric about the vertical axis, the amplitude of the <b>wave</b> eld can <b>be</b> reconstructed from the displacements through matrix inversion methods, a simple adaption of inverse tomograph...|$|R

25|$|Due to the {{connections}} between atoms, the displacement {{of one or more}} atoms from their equilibrium positions give rise to a set of vibration waves propagating through the lattice.

40|$|Secondary <b>waves</b> <b>are</b> elastic shear <b>waves</b> {{that travel}} through the Earth. Discussion S <b>waves</b> <b>are</b> seismic body <b>waves</b> meaning they {{travel through the}} Earth’s interior.
