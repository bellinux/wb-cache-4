30|$|Fast {{pyrolysis}} is {{a process}} in which a material, such as biomass, is rapidly heated to high temperatures in the absence of air (specifically oxygen). It involves fast heating of biomass but not as fast as flash pyrolysis. Heating rate is somewhere about 300 °C/min. Generally, fast pyrolysis is used to obtain high-grade bio-oil. Fast pyrolysis is successful with different reactors configurations, some of them are fluidized-bed reactors, entrained flow reactor, <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>reactor,</b> vacuum furnace reactor, vortex reactor, rotating reactor, circulating fluidized bed reactor. If the purpose was to maximize the yield of liquid products resulting from biomass pyrolysis, a low temperature, high heating rate, short gas residence time process would be required. If the purpose were to maximize the yield of fuel gas resulting from biomass pyrolysis, a high temperature, low heating rate, long gas residence time process would be preferred [9, 53 – 55].|$|E

In this paper the volatile emission characteristic of pulverized coal is studied under air atmosphere and oxy-fuel atmosphere. Combustion experiments of Datong bituminous coal were carried out in a <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>reactor</b> at heating rates of 1 K/s, 10 K/s and 1000 K/s respectively under air and O 2 /CO 2 atmosphere conditions in order to investigate the volatile emission characteristic. The concentrations of volatile (mainly CO and CH 4) emission were on-line measured by infrared gas analyzer. It was indicated that the concentrations of CO and CH 4 in O 2 /CO 2 atmosphere were higher than those in air. The direct oxidation of carbon and gasification reaction between carbon and CO 2 are the main causes of the increased amount of CO. The higher concentration of CO 2 also results in the increased amount of CH 4 in O 2 /CO 2 conditions. </p...|$|E

It consists of a preliminary characterization followed by further investigation (TG-FTIR analysis, kinetic abstraction, analysis on solid residue) {{to shed light on}} the effects of different operating conditions. The volatile matter released is found to strongly depend on the conditions used during the thermal treatment. Kinetics of devolatilization are obtained as functions of the heating rate {{in a wide range of}} conditions using different facilities on a laboratory scale (TG balance, <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>reactor,</b> electrodynamic balance).

The global gasification reactivities of char samples were also determined for a range of pressures between 1 and 20 bar using pressurised thermogravimetric analysis technique. Char reactivities were found to increase with increasing pyrolysis heating rates and decreasing pyrolysis pressure. It was found that under high heating rates the char particles underwent plastic deformation (i. e. melted) developing a structure different to that of the virgin biomass.

Coal from Indonesia East Kalimantan mine, which has high moisture and high volatile matter, was chosen as a sample. Experiments were carried out at the heating rate of 1, 000 oC/s and isothermal condition was kept at peak temperature under atmospheric pressure. The char, tar and gas formation characteristics of the coal {{as well as the}} composition of the gas components at peak temperatures were determined. The experimental results showed that devolatilization process terminated when temperature reached above 1, 100 oC. Most of tar was formed at about 800 oC, while the rate of tar formation decreased gradually as the temperature increased. CH 4 was observed at temperatures above 600 oC, whereas H 2 was detected above 1, 000 oC. The amount of formed gases such as H 2, CO, CH 4 and CnHm increased as the temperature increased. From the characteristics of devolatilization with residence time, it was con-cluded that devolatilization terminated within about 0. 7 second when the temperature reached 1, 000 oC. As the operating temperature in an entrained flow gasifier is higher than ash melting temperature, it is expected that the devolatilization time of high volatile coal should be less than one second in an entrained flow gasifier...|$|E

Two pieces of <b>wire</b> <b>meshes</b> were made from stainless steel inserted at 10 and 13 mm {{from the end of}} combustor. Propane was used as fuel in this research. Flame was stabilized in the region between two <b>wire</b> <b>meshes.</b> The flame has a blue luminosity, indicate no soot formation condition.

40|$|The {{three primary}} {{lignocellulosic}} biomass components (cellulose, xylan and lignin), synthetic biomass samples (prepared by mixing the three primary components) and lignocellulosic biomass (oak, spruce and pine) were pyrolysed in a thermogravimetric analyser and a <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>reactor.</b> Different reactivities were observed {{between the three}} biomass components. Cellulose mainly produced condensables and was less dependent on heating rate, while xylan and lignin contributed most char yields and were significantly affected by heating rate. While xylan and lignin pyrolysed over a large temperature range and showed the behaviour characteristic of solid fuels, cellulose decomposition is sharp in a narrow temperature range, a behaviour typical of linear polymers. Comparison of the pyrolysis behaviour of individual components with that of their synthetic mixtures showed that interactions between cellulose {{and the other two}} components take place, but no interaction was found between xylan and lignin. No obvious interaction occurred for synthetic mixtures and lignocellulosic biomass at 325 C, before the beginning of cellulose pyrolysis, in slow and high heating rate. At higher pyrolysis temperatures, more char was obtained for synthetic mixtures containing cellulose compared to the estimated value based on the individual components and their proportions in the mixture. For lignocellulosic biomass, less char and more tar were obtained than predicted from the components, which may be associated with the morphology of samples.

40|$|The {{formation}} of liquid intermediates {{and the distribution}} of products were studied under slow and fast pyrolysis conditions. Results indicate that monomers are formed from lignin oligomeric products during secondary reactions, rather than directly from the native lignin. Lignin from Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) wood was extracted using the milled wood enzyme lignin isolation method. Slow pyrolysis using a microscope with hot-stage captured the liquid formation (> 150 °C), shrinking, swelling (foaming), and evaporation behavior of lignin intermediates. The activation energy (Ea) for 5 – 80 % conversions was 213 kJ mol− 1, and the pre-exponential factor (log A) was 24. 34. Fast pyrolysis tests in a <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>reactor</b> were conducted (300 – 650 °C).

GC/MS and UV-Fluorescence of the mesh reactor condensate revealed lignin oligomer formation but no mono-phenols were seen. An increase in pyrolytic lignin yield was observed as temperature increased. The molar mass determined by ESI-MS was not affected by pyrolysis temperature. SEM of the char showed a smooth surface with holes, evidence of a liquid intermediate with foaming; bursting from these foams could be responsible for the removal of lignin oligomers.

40|$|The {{concentration}} {{and type of}} free radicals from the decay (termination stage) of pyrolysis at slow and fast heating rates and at high temperatures (above 1000 °C) in biomass char have been studied. A room-temperature electron spin resonance spectroscopy study was conducted on original wood, herbaceous biomass, holocelluloses, lignin and their chars, prepared at high temperatures in a <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>reactor,</b> an entrained flow reactor, and a tubular reactor. The radical concentrations in the chars from the decay stage range up between 7 · 1016 and 1. 5 · 1018 spins g− 1. The {{results indicated that the}} biomass major constituents (cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin) had a minor effect on remaining radical concentrations compared to potassium and silica contents. The higher radical concentrations in the wheat straw chars from the decay stage of pyrolysis in the entrained flow reactor compared to the wood chars were related to the decreased mobility of potassium in the char matrix, leading to the less efficient catalytic effects of potassium on the bond-breaking and radical re-attachments. The high Si levels in the rice husk caused an increase in the char radical concentration compared to the wheat straw because the free radicals were trapped in a char consisting of a molten amorphous silica at heating rates of 103 – 104  K s− 1. The experimental electron spin resonance spectroscopy spectra were analyzed by fitting to simulated data in order to identify radical types, based on g-values and line widths.

40|$|High-intensity pyrolysis, rapid heating in an {{inert gas}} {{atmosphere}} at up to 20 atm pressure, of 6 Australian coals was examined to gain further insight into high-intensity processes such as Integrated Gasification Combined Cycles (IGCC). Experiments focussed on pyrolysis in a specially developed <b>Wire</b> <b>Mesh</b> <b>Reactor</b> (WMR). The particle temperature lagged that of the mesh by 0. 2 seconds at a heating rate of 100 ~C s - 1 and was predicted by modelling. This {{is part of the}} reason the volatile yield (VY) results for 10 s hold-time at b 1. 7 wt% daf of coal, is much more reproducible than 1 s hold-time experiments at b 4. 2 wt% daf of coal. Four coals of the same rank did not behave identically when heated. Three of the coals had a pyrolysis VY the same as the proximate VM when heated to 100 ~C at 1 atm but the fourth, higher inertinite coal had a 1 atm pyrolysis VY 90 % of its proximate VM. All four coals of similar rank had a significant decrease in VY, between 10 and 20 wt% daf of coal, with pressure increasing from 1 to 20 atm. The two lower rank coals showed less decrease in VY with increasing pressure than the higher rank and higher inertinite coals. The lower decrease in VY with increased pressure was mostly attributed to the lower inertinite levels for both the coals of similar rank and VM, and the coals of lower rank. Char characteristics examined focussed on pore Surface Area (SA). For high intensity WMR and Drop Tube Furnace (DTF) pyrolysis experiments CO 2 SA for char from a particular coal was similar but the BET SA different. This was due to the char in the WMR experiments having longer to form larger pores determined by BET N 2 SA. Both the N 2 and CO 2 SA was more than an order of magnitude greater than for low intensity pyrolysis char. This highlights that the WMR can be used to attain char with similar CO 2 SA characteristics as other high intensity pyrolysis experiments and to provide a more meaningful insight into char reactivity than low intensity chars do...|$|E
40|$|International audienceNowadays, {{ligno-cellulosic biomass}} is {{considered}} as a renewable carbon resource. It represents a relevant alternative to reduce greenhouse gases emissions. Last decades, many scientists and industrials {{have been interested in}} thermochemical conversion of biomass such as gasification. In order to model these reactors, it is important to observe thermochemical phenomena, through dedicated experiments close to the industrial conditions. Accordingly, it is interesting to study the pyrolysis step, notably in conditions representative of fluidized bed, one of the major technologies to gasify biomass. The aim of this communication is to present and compare the new vertical image furnace realized by LRGP and four other fast pyrolysis setups: <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>reactor</b> [1], free fall reactor [2], radiant furnace [3] and other image furnaces [4, 5]. The vertical image furnace is based on the former horizontal setup which has been described in details in previous works [4, 6]. The principle is to concentrate the radiation of a 5 kW xenon arc lamp on a biomass sample. The lamp is settled at the first focus of an elliptical mirror. The light beams are concentrated at the second focus where the biomass sample is placed inside a cylindrical reactor. A controlled flow of nitrogen at ambient temperature sweeps this reactor to quench vapours and prevent any gas-phase reactions. The radiant flux applied to the biomass can reach 800 kW. m -². This is the maximum heat flux encountered by a solid fuel injected inside a fluidized bed [6]. During pyrolysis, gases are collected in a sampling bag, liquids are condensed in a cold bath (T = 223 K) and aerosols are filtered. The solid residue is remained in the reactor. As soon as the light beams are switched off, the different products could be recovered, weighted and analysed (CHON, Karl Fischer, GC and HPLC). The main innovations of this setup are the heat flux modulation over time to reproduce fluidized bed conditions, the pyrometric temperature measurement and the vertical orientation of the concentrated beams. This feature allows studying very thin samples of wood pieces which are pyrolysed in chemical regime, but also other kind of biomass (powders and liquids). The comparison of this new setup with other fast pyrolysis lab reactors focuses on technical features: maximum temperature, heating rate, pressure, solid residence time, gas-phase conditions (temperature and residence time), type of biomass sample and its dimensions. This comparison allows evaluating advantages and drawbacks of this vertical image furnace setup. References [1] E.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Biomass (i. e. {{organic matter}} derived from living organisms) is {{currently}} the world's most underutilised fuel source and does {{not contribute to the}} global warming when combusted. Fossil fuel-fired power plants are Australia's major contributors to its total greenhouse gas emissions. The usage of the fossil fuels needs to be decreased in our world as its negative impact, global warming, is becoming more evident. Therefore, research efforts need to be direct to the development of advanced biomass-fired systems, such as Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle. While these high efficiency energy production methods are being implemented, Australia will be able to achieve its Mandatory Renewable Energy Target (MRET) and moreover will be able to meet the responsibilities to the generations to come. Pressurised biomass gasification is a key area in the successful development of these new concepts. Unfortunately, there has been very little information on biomass gasification at high pressure and/or high heating rate conditions in the literature. Therefore, the aim of this project was to gain a fundamental understanding about the gasification characteristics of chars that are generated from three different biomass species, namely, radiata pine, spotted gum and sugarcane bagasse. The research, in particular, focused on: (i) determining the gasification reactivities.; (ii) investigating the structural and compositional transformations during pyrolysis.; (iii) their influence on the gasification reactivity. The physical and chemical structures as well as gasification reactivities of chars were studied to gain insight into the role of heating rate and pressure on the gasification characteristics of biomass chars. Char samples were generated in a <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>reactor</b> (WMR) and a tubular reactor. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis, X-Ray diffractometry (XRD), digital cinematography and surface area analysis were employed to determine the impact of operating conditions on the char structure. Char reactivities were found to increase with increasing pyrolysis heating rates the char particles underwent plastic deformation (i. e. melted), developing a structure different to that of the virgin biomass. Pressure was also found to influence the physical and chemical structures of char particles. The difference in the gasification reactivities of biomass chars at pressure was found to correlate well with the effect of pyrolysis pressure on the graphitisation process in the biomass char structure. The gasification kinetics of biomass chars have been investigated within the temperature range of 800 - 950 °C, CO₂ concentrations of 10 % to 100 % v/v, pressures between 1 - 20 bar using the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) technique. For the range of biomass species studied the activation energies of atmospheric CO₂ gasification were within 200 - 240 kJ/mol, and the reaction orders between 0. 4 - 1. These results are in good agreement with kinetic data reported in the literature. The Quartz Wool Matrix (QWM) method was used to simulate circulating fluidised bed conditions and reactivity results were compared with the TGA data. Kinetic data from TGA analyses was found to be suitable for predicting CFB gasification reactivity. Total pressure variations have been found to have no effect on reactivity during char conversion. The Langmuir-Hinselwood rate equation represents the pressurised biomass char gasification kinetics well. The Langmuir-Hinshelwood expression for radiata pine char at studies conditions can be described as the following: [formula could not be replicated]. The number of experiments and the biomass samples used in this study could of course be increased. However, in its current order, it is filling a very substantial gap in the current literature, especially in the pressurised pyrolysis and gasification studies.

With the steel <b>wire</b> <b>meshes</b> in place, a layer of stones (10  cm thick; 20, 10 and 5  mm diameter) was laid to enable even gas to charge. After the stone paving had been laid, several 70 -mesh steel <b>wire</b> <b>meshes</b> were placed on the stone layer. The stable stone pad forms the structure of the gas-charging base. The prepared coal is placed into a primary box and tamped. Pressure, stress and temperature sensors were placed in the coal sample at different layers and locations. The top shell was set in place and sealed. Leak detection was conducted to ensure that the experimental box was airtight.|$|R
40|$|Measurement of {{velocity}} {{upstream and downstream}} {{a special}} <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> was performed to ascertain {{the effect of the}} mesh on the flow. The mesh consisted of two components, a basic rectangular mesh with mesh width 1. 22 mm and wire diameter 0. 2 mm, and a top steel wool with random position of wires and wire diameter 0. 05 mm. The velocity was measured by Constant Temperature Anemometry using single wire probe in a Plexiglas channel of rectangular cross-section. As a first step, measurement of one horizontal and one vertical measuring line was performed 10 mm upstream and 6 mm downstream the <b>wire</b> <b>mesh.</b> A spatial velocity profile upstream of the <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> was smooth, while the downstream velocity profile was highly disturbed. However, velocity fluctuations expressed in terms of turbulence intensity downstream of the <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> were attenuated down to 1 %. Further measurements of the area downstream the <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> will be performed to describe the development of the flow...|$|R
40|$|<b>Wire</b> <b>mesh</b> {{vibration}} dampers {{have been the}} subject of some very encouraging experiments at the Texas A&M Turbomachinery laboratories for the past several years and have emerged as an excellent replacement for squeeze film dampers. Their capability to provide damping for a wide range of temperatures (even cryogenic), fluid free operation and ability to perform even when soaked with lubricants makes them a suitable option as a bearing damper. Experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of design parameters like axial thickness and axial compression that influence the characteristics of <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> as a bearing damper. Two groups of <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> were tested to show that the stiffness and damping are directly proportional to the axial thickness, if all the other parameters are kept constant. Tests on four <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> donuts of different radial thickness showed that stiffness and damping vary inversely with radial thickness. Rigorous tests were also conducted to quantify the effects of axial compression, radial interference and displacement amplitude on stiffness and damping of the <b>wire</b> <b>mesh.</b> Another novel kind of mesh damper tested was comprised of two small segments instead of a whole donut. The results showed that <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> exhibited good damping characteristics even when used in small segments. Empirical expressions were developed using MathCADTM worksheets, and an existing ExcelTM design worksheet was modified to include these factors. The effect of frequency variation was also included to give a comprehensive design tool for <b>wire</b> <b>mesh.</b> A new design worksheet was developed that can predict rotordynamic coefficients for a <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> bearing damper having a different size as well as different installation and operational conditions...|$|R

It is a corrosion resistant <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> that is largely used in structural building. It is also available in different forms like rolls and panels for industrial uses.|$|R
40|$|Potassium-modified FeCrAl alloy <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> was {{developed}} as a catalytic diesel particulate filter to suppress the emission of soot from a diesel engine. Potassium species were deposited on <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> by a chemical vapor deposition method, in which a model soot was used to convert KOH into metallic K at high temperatures to subsequently activate the <b>wire</b> <b>mesh.</b> Tests showed that metallic K reacted with the enriched Al 2 O 3 component on the surface derived from segregation and successive oxidation during precalcination. The resulting layer of K-O-Al species offers remarkable activity and stability for the catalytic oxidation of diesel soot. The K-activated <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> could lower the initial temperature of soot combustion and maintain the activity for several cycles...|$|R
