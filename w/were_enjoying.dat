5|$|The Devi Bhagavata Purana narrates that Krishna and {{his lover}} Radha <b>were</b> <b>enjoying</b> dalliance, when they thirsted for milk. So, Krishna created a cow called Surabhi and a calf called Manoratha {{from the left}} side of his body, and milked the cow. When {{drinking}} the milk, the milk pot fell on the ground and broke, spilling the milk, which became the Kshirasagara, the cosmic milk ocean. Numerous cows then emerged from the pores of Surabhi's skin and were presented to the cowherd-companions (Gopas) of Krishna by him. Then Krishna worshipped Surabhi and decreed that she—a cow, the giver of milk and prosperity—be worshipped at Diwali on Bali Pratipada day.|$|E
