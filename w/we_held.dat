25|$|What, by contrast, can be {{established}} is that from 1911 onwards the term became commonplace and, initially confined {{as it was to}} the painters of Room 41, it was afterwards attributed to those who seemed, nearly or at a distance, to approach them, in appearance if not in spirit. Apollinaire himself was initially reticent about this label and it was not until later, after this opening at the Indépendants, during an exhibition which <b>we</b> <b>held</b> at Brussels, that he accepted definitively on his own and our behalf, the name 'Cubist' by which all sorts of people had designated us in irony. In 1911 the word Cubism was born {{in the same way as}} the word 'Impressionism' in 1872.|$|E
25|$|Geronimo {{was raised}} with the {{traditional}} religious views of the Bedonkohe. When questioned about his views on life after death, {{he wrote in his}} 1905 autobiography, As to the future state, the teachings of our tribe were not specific, that is, we had no definite idea of our relations and surroundings in after life. We believed that there is a life after this one, but no one ever told me as to what part of man lived after death... <b>We</b> <b>held</b> that the discharge of one's duty would make his future life more pleasant, but whether that future life was worse than this life or better, we did not know, and no one was able to tell us. We hoped that in the future life, family and tribal relations would be resumed. In a way we believed this, but we did not know it.|$|E

500|$|.....To prepare Mau Piailug for the voyage, David Lewis briefed {{him on the}} {{geography}} of the islands {{in this part of}} the Pacific and the winds and currents that could be expected along the way, all information that an early Polynesian navigator acquainted with this route would have carried in his head. In addition, to alert Mau of how the elevation of stars above the northern and southern horizons would change as the canoe sailed farther and farther south, <b>we</b> <b>held</b> training sessions in Honolulu's Bishop Museum planetarium to graphically show how, for example, as one sailed toward Tahiti Polaris sank lower and lower on the northern horizon until it disappeared at the equator while the Southern Cross curved higher and higher in the sky. During his first few days of the voyage, Mau received further coaching on the pattern of winds and currents from Rodo Williams, a veteran Tahitian seaman on the crew who the year before had sailed a yacht from Tahiti to Hawaii and could therefore provide Mau with a firsthand account of what he could expect to encounter.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the album}} was {{completed}} in August 1981, its release was delayed {{for a whole year}} until the group felt ready to release it. Gartside defended the decision to hold back the album, saying that [...] "we could have released it then, and it would probably have got some nice reviews, sold a few thousand copies and disappeared. But we thought that if <b>we</b> <b>held</b> on to it, put out 'The [...] "Sweetest Girl"', built on that a bit, took some more singles off the album, built up the interest and then put it out, it would do a lot more. Seeing as we were really pleased with it, I would much rather that happened." ...|$|E

In Cowan, a Portage County deputy dog warden determined two dogs to be vicious following a complaint that the dogs had attacked a woman. Id. at ¶ 1. The dogs were determined to be vicious because of the alleged attack, not because they were pit bulls. <b>We</b> <b>held</b> that when a dog is determined to be [...] "vicious" [...] under R.C. 955.11(A)(4)(a), procedural due process requires that the owner have notice and an opportunity to be heard before the owner is charged with a crime.

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Digital Spy, Braxton explained that she have been recorded around 30 songs {{and would like to}} collaborate with artists, such as Alicia Keys. Braxton also explained the delay of the album: [...] "The album was supposed to come out in February, but <b>we</b> <b>held</b> it back because seven of the ten songs we picked were leaked. We {{decided to go back to}} the studio, record four or five more songs and then pick. Now we send everything via Federal Express – nothing's going through the internet – and that's why none of the new songs have leaked so far." [...] The song [...] "Woman" [...] is a cover version of the original song by Delta Goodrem from her 2007 album Delta.|$|E

2500|$|Egypt {{qualifying}} for the Olympic quarter-finals on 1 August, {{six months to}} the day after being devastated by Port Said Stadium disaster. For no-one was the triumph more poignant than the team's captain, Mohamed Aboutrika. It is hardly surprising to hear that the 33-year-old will never forget what he saw that dreadful night, which ended with him comforting the injured and dying in a chaotic Al Ahly dressing room. What is unexpected is to hear him say that he doesn’t wish to forget. However, as Aboutrika explained, it is his desire to honour the 79 who lost their lives in Port Said which compels him to keep them uppermost in his thoughts as he leads the national team onwards at London 2012. [...] "Those people are always in my mind because <b>we</b> <b>held</b> them as they were dying," [...] he recalled. [...] "They are always with us and they give us strong motivation to honour them and give everything we have. We try to help their families in whatever way we can, and hopefully winning here will provide the all people back home with some happiness." ...|$|E

"All {{our people}} being {{gathered}} together, <b>we</b> <b>held</b> a council together, to leave off drinking {{for the space}} of four years, and we all in general agreed to it, taking into consideration the ill consequences that attend it and what disturbance it makes, and that two of our brothers, the Mingoes, {{lost their lives in}} our towns by rum, and that we would live in peace and quietness and become another people...The proposal of stopping the rum and all strong liquors was made to the rest [...] in the winter, and they were all willing. As soon as it was concluded of, all the rum that was in the Towns was all staved and spilled, belonging both to Indians and white people, which in quantity consisted of about forty gallons, that was thrown in the street, and we have appointed four men to stave all the rum or strong liquors that is brought to the Towns hereafter, either by Indians or white men, during the four years. We would be glad if our brothers would send strict orders that we might prevent the rum coming to the hunting cabins or to the neighboring towns. We have sent wampum to the French, to the Five Nations, to the Delaware...to tell them not to bring any rum to our towns, for we want none...so we would be glad if our brothers would inform the traders not bring any for we are sorry, after they have brought it a great way, for them to have it broke, and when they're once warned they will take care." ...|$|E
