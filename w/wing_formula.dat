The study was conducted on 12 nestlings obtained from parents of different colour varieties.

During the research period 47 eggs were obtained, from which 16 nestlings were hatched. The highest number of clutches was noted {{in the summer and}} autumn months. The values obtained for zoometric traits, indicate that nestlings maintained in captivity, compared to those living in natural conditions, showed a higher growth rate as well as a quicker plumage development. In a majority of birds the length of the body, wing, primary remiges and beak reached adult dimensions in week 7 of life, while body weight and tail length- in week 8.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work is to passively reduce the induced drag of the rear <b>wing</b> of a <b>Formula</b> One car at high {{velocity}} through aeroelastic tailoring. The angle-of-attack of the rear wing is fixed and {{is determined by the}} required downforce needed to get around a turn. As a result, at higher velocity, the amount of downforce and related induced drag increases. The maximum speed on a straight part is thus reduced due to the increase in induced drag. A fibre reinforced composite torsion box with extension-shear coupled upper and lower skins is used leading to bending-torsion coupling. Three-dimensional static aeroelastic analysis is performed loosely coupling the Finite Element code Nastran and the Computational Fluid Dynamics panel code VSAERO using ModelCenter. A <b>wing</b> representative of <b>Formula</b> One rear <b>wings</b> is optimised for minimum induced drag using a response surface methodology. Results indicate that a substantial induced drag reduction is achievable while maintaining the desired downforce during low speed turns.

40|$|The thesis {{investigated}} avian {{diversity within}} rice fields at three {{locations in the}} Philippines. From February 2012 until April 2014, avian community structure was recorded {{to determine the effect}} that different farming techniques have upon frequency and abundance within the habitat. Investigations were conducted to challenge the common misconception that all birds are a threat to crop yield, with detailed research into the life-cycle and diet of the Eurasian tree sparrow (Passer montanus). Twenty-seven continuous months of bird surveys were conducted to record annual, and temporal, changes in frequency and diversity. A total of 130 species were recorded, and explanations for abundance patterns discussed. Species biological richness scores indicated that time of year and field stage are important factors affecting diversity within rice fields. To investigate the effect different farming techniques have upon avian diversity, two largescale crop manipulations were investigated; fields under a water management technique (Alternate Wetting and Drying) and areas of accelerated rice production. Both investigations indicated that avian frequency and abundance were higher within manipulated fields when compared to control sites. Differences in community structure are discussed identifying a change under manipulated conditions. Artificial nest boxes were used to record breeding season and productivity, with biometric measurements, for the Eurasian tree sparrow sub-species‘saturatus’, which produced more eggs but successfully fledged fewer young, over a longer breeding period. A significant difference in <b>wing</b> <b>formulae</b> between sexes indicates a difference in life-style strategies. To determine diet, stable isotopic analysis of claws measured ratios of δ 15 N. Differences in δ 15 N were compared to a control group fed on a ‘pure’ diet. Results indicated a mixed diet when given free choice, but could not be identified within the current data set.

Designers in the 1950s had addressed the same problem of reducing the cars cross sectional area by tilting the engines around a vertical or longitudinal axis by a small amount.

40|$|A {{formula is}} derived to {{calculate}} structural <b>wing</b> mass. This <b>formula</b> {{can be applied}} to twin fuselage aircraft, conventional single-body aircraft and some other unconventional aircraft (such as the Voyager). The approach is particularly useful in the first stages of preliminary aircraft design and in optimization programs where the wing-mass calculation time is an important characteristic. The concept model assumes a nontapered inboard wing section, a tapered outboard wing section and fuel stored only in the outboard wing. The theory for the wing-mass estimation is described. Unlike the other mass formulae where mass spanwise distribution is considered by an "unloading coefficient, " the present method integrates the mass spanwise distribution with the air load spanwise distribution. This allows more precise consideration of the wing geometry and mass unloading. There are no simplifications applied and the formula completely reflects the initial concept model.

For a power-law particle distribution (N(gamma) proportional to gamma(-p)), the line profile for the particle distribution of p = 2 is more like a continuum than a line, and the peak of it occurs at a higher frequency than the rest one. In the case of the high power-law index (p > 2), the line profile peaks at the intrinsic frequency {{of the line}} and extends over a large frequency range in the blue wing, but sharply drops in the red <b>wing.</b> The analytic <b>formulae</b> describing the line profiles presented in this work will be potentially useful in further profile calculations on nuclear lines from different astrophysical systems.

40|$|A multi-element front <b>wing</b> of a <b>formula</b> student car was {{analyzed}} using the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software STAR-CCM+. A {{number of cases}} were simulated in steady state to get {{an understanding of the}} interaction between the wing, the front wheels, the car body (monocoque) and the ground. Three different flap settings were simulated in three different heights in combinations with and without the following elements: Front wheels, monocoque, ground, front wing. The SST k-omega turbulence model was used with a polyhedral mesh. Chord Reynolds numbers were between 545 000 [...] 600 000. It was found that both the front wing operating isolated from other components and the wing operating in interaction with the front wheels and the monocoque responded with increased downforce in ground effect. Optimal ground height was dependent on flap setting: The mild configuration did not stall at any of the simulated heights, while the flaps on the aggressive configuration stalled close to the ground in the isolated case. Ground effect improved the downforce produced by the wing in free stream by up to 50. 7 %. Comparisons of the wing in mild and high downforce settings were done with and without the wheels. The wing-wheel interaction reduced the downforce produced in the mild flap angle setting by 20. 5 % by obstructing the flow, but increased the downforce of the high flap angle setting by 2. 2 % by introducing surface normal adverse pressure gradients, preventing boundary layer separation. The wing-monocoque interaction increased downforce in all simulated cases. The monocoque caused increased velocity and suction {{on the bottom of the}} symmetric center section, thus reducing the 3 D effects across the span toward the high-downforce section. This contributed to enhanced sectional lift coefficient along the complete span, increasing downforce produced by the wing with low flap angles and wheels behind by 14. 3 % and correspondingly for the high flap angle an increase of 10. 8 %. </p...|$|R
