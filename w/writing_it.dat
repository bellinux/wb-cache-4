5|$|Most of Leonardo's {{writings}} are in mirror-image cursive.

5|$|Although Dickinson's acquaintances {{were most}} likely aware of her <b>writing,</b> <b>it</b> was not until after her death in 1886—when Lavinia, Dickinson's younger sister, {{discovered}} her cache of poems—that the breadth of her work became apparent to the public. Her first collection of poetry was published in 1890 by personal acquaintances Thomas Wentworth Higginson and Mabel Loomis Todd, though both heavily edited the content. A complete, and mostly unaltered, collection of her poetry became available {{for the first time}} when scholar Thomas H. Johnson published The Poems of Emily Dickinson in 1955.|$|E

The following year he submitted a publisher's proposal for The Secret War, a full account of deception during the Second World War, but was prevented from <b>writing</b> <b>it</b> by the Official Secrets Act. His final book was fiction, a thriller entitled Golden Arrow, published in 1955.|$|E

The following year Parliament voted 401 to 77 for a resolution demanding {{the right to decide}} its own working locations. Attempts to include this in the following treaties in 2000 and 2007 both failed. However, in September 2008 Parliament held its first full plenary session in Brussels after the ceiling of the Strasbourg chamber collapsed during recess forcing the temporary move.|$|E

The producers were initially uneasy about the episode, as they feared that the purposely bad writing would be mistaken for actual bad writing.

5|$|In 1779, after {{returning}} from France, Adams was also elected to the Massachusetts Constitutional Convention, {{to create a new}} constitution for Massachusetts. Once there, he served on a committee of three, also including Samuel Adams and James Bowdoin, to draft the constitution. The task of <b>writing</b> <b>it</b> fell primarily to John Adams. The resulting Constitution of Massachusetts was approved in 1780. It was the first constitution written by a special committee, then ratified by the people; and was also the first to feature a bicameral legislature. Included were a distinct executive – though restrained by an executive council – with a partial (two-thirds) veto, and a separate judicial branch.|$|E

Blatty went on to win an Academy Award for his Exorcist screenplay, as well as Golden Globes for Best Picture and Best <b>Writing.</b> <b>It</b> also became the first horror film ever to be nominated for the best picture Oscar.|$|E
5|$|Sonnet 102 {{is one of}} the 154 sonnets {{written by}} English playwright and poet William Shakespeare. It {{is one of the}} Fair Youth sonnets, in which Shakespeare writes of an unnamed youth with whom the poet is enamored. Sonnet 102 is among a series of {{seemingly}} connected sonnets, from Sonnet 100 to Sonnet 103, in which the poet speaks of a silence between his Muse and himself. The exact date of writing is unknown, and there is contention among scholars about when they were written. Paul Hammond among other scholars believes that sonnets 61-103 were written primarily during the early 1590s, and then being edited or added to later, during the early 1600s (decade). Regardless of date of <b>writing,</b> <b>it</b> was published later {{along with the rest of}} the sonnets of the 1609 Quarto.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor {{comes to}} the end of the {{transcript}} and Sally realises Larry has stopped <b>writing</b> <b>it</b> due to the presence of an Angel in the room. The Doctor, surmising their fate, warns them not even to blink around the Angels. Sally and Larry make their way to the basement of the house and discover more Angels guarding the TARDIS. The Angels attack and Sally and Larry use the Yale key to hide inside the TARDIS. The Angels surround and rock the TARDIS to try to gain entry. Once in the control room, a hologram of the Doctor informs them that they have a control disk with them. Larry takes a now-glowing DVD from his pocket and inserts it into the console. The TARDIS' engines engage and the ship dematerialises, leaving a panicking Sally and Larry behind. With the TARDIS gone, the Angels who were all stood around the TARDIS have been tricked into looking at each other and have become permanently frozen as statues.|$|E
