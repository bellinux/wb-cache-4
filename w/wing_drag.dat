25|$|P. exigua are small, swarm {{founding}} wasps. One {{can determine}} the wasps’ age by evaluating {{the darkness of the}} cuticle on the apical edge of the fifth gastral sternite. Older wasps typically exhibit darker shades relative to others in its colony. The front wing length is generally 4.15mm, and their wings are more rounded than other wasps. This round wing shape may enhance the wasp species’ flying abilities and increase fitness. The muscle mass on P. exigua’s mesosoma directly contributes to flight power; the larger the muscle, the stronger the output. Instead of flapping their wings, P. exigua row them due to increased <b>wing</b> <b>drag.</b> Mature P. exigua eggs have a complete chorion and are tinted blue with a shiny coat. Immature oocytes that are equal in size to mature eggs can be distinguished due to their cream and less glossy appearance.|$|E

However, while the regulations specifically banned the system developed by Mercedes, they make no provision for the variant developed by Lotus.|$|E

5000|$|Any {{aerodynamic}} {{approach that}} decreased <b>wing</b> <b>drag</b> was welcomed by sailplane designers, who reduced lift-induced drag with high aspect ratio wings. [...] Profile drag was reduced by maintaining laminar flow over {{as much of}} the wing as possible. [...] The NACA 6-series profiles of the late 1930s suggested that laminar flow might be maintained as far back as 70% chord, though military experience during World War II showed that much less ambitious targets were hard to achieve with riveted surfaces on wings with gaps for control surfaces, armament, service hatches etc. After the war, sailplane designers realised that their wooden surfaces could, with care, be made smoother over long distances than metal ones, that sailplanes had fewer wing surface interruptions than military machines and their lower speeds meant lower Reynolds numbers, encouraging stronger laminar flow. Such aircraft began to appear from 1950 onwards and showed striking improvements in performance.|$|E

In-flight measurements were made of the icing cloud environment, {{the shape of the}} ice accretion on the wing, and the corresponding increase in the <b>wing</b> section <b>drag.</b> Results are presented for three icing encounters.

50|$|Extending {{the wing}} flaps {{increases}} the camber or {{curvature of the}} wing, raising the maximum lift coefficient or the upper limit to the lift a wing can generate. This allows the aircraft to generate the required lift at a lower speed, reducing the stalling speed of the aircraft, and therefore also the minimum speed at which the aircraft will safely maintain flight. The increase in camber also increases the <b>wing</b> <b>drag,</b> which can be beneficial during approach and landing, because it slows the aircraft. In some aircraft configurations, a useful side effect of flap deployment is a decrease in aircraft pitch angle, which lowers the nose thereby improving the pilot's view of the runway over {{the nose of the}} aircraft during landing. In other configurations, however, {{depending on the type of}} flap and the location of the wing, flaps can cause the nose to rise (pitch-up), obscuring the pilot's view of the runway.|$|E
50|$|The Racer {{made its}} maiden flight {{in the spring}} of 1926. Later that year, however, it was badly damaged in an {{emergency}} landing at Westland's Yeovil factory. It was decided to rebuild the aircraft as a fighter, with a new, all-metal, fuselage. The Falcon was replaced by one of Rolls-Royce's new F.XI (later known as the Kestrel engines giving 490 hp (366 kW) in a more streamlined nose, while two Vickers machine guns were mounted semi-externally in the fuselage sides. It retained the wooden parasol wing of the Racer, which was mounted close to the fuselage on tandem pylons on the fuselage centreline. The undercarriage was of tailwheel type, while the thick section wing allowed the aircraft's fuel tanks to be buried in the wing, saving space in the fusealge while keeping <b>wing</b> <b>drag</b> low, also allowing a gravity feed to the engine and reducing fire risks. The cockpit was more or less in line with the trailing edge of the wing. The seat was of such a height that the pilot's eyes were in the neighbourhood of being level with the wing. This enabled him to look either over or under the wing. The height of the seat was adjustable on the ground, and the rudder bar could be set up for two positions to suit different pilots.|$|E
40|$|The N. A. C.

Tests were also conducted to determine the over-all effect of manufacturing irregularities incidental to riveted aluminum alloy and to spot-welded stainless-steel construction. The tests {{were made in the}} 8 -foot high speed wind tunnel at Reynolds Numbers up to 18, 000, 000. The results show that any of the surface irregularities investigated may increase <b>wing</b> <b>drag</b> enough to have important adverse effects on high-speed performance and economy.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} wing aerostructural analysis and optimization, which needs much lower computational costs, while computes the <b>wing</b> <b>drag</b> and structural deformation {{with a level of}} accuracy comparable to the higher fidelity CFD and FEM tools. A quasi-threedimensional aerodynamic solver is developed and connected to a finite beam element model for wing aerostructural optimization. In a quasi-three-dimensional approach an inviscid incompressible vortex lattice method is coupled with a viscous compressible airfoil analysis code for drag prediction of a three dimensional wing. The accuracy of the proposed method for <b>wing</b> <b>drag</b> prediction is validated by comparing its results with the results of a higher fidelity CFD analysis. The wing structural deformation as well as the stress distribution in the wingbox structure is computed using a finite beam element model. The Newton method is used to solve the coupled system.

The fuselage and nacelle fineness ratios were 10. 0 and 9. 66, respectively. The wings had the NACA 6 5 ~ 0 0 9 airfoil section in the free-stream direction. The <b>wing</b> <b>drag</b> coefficient was lowered at high subsonic and super-sonic speeds when the aspect ratio w a s reduced from 6. 0 to 3. 55.

The wing-tip nacelle locations on both the high- and low-aspect-ratio wings were favorable from a drag standpoint; however, less favorable nacelle-plus-interference drag was obtained at the wing tip by reducing the span of the high-aspect-ratio wing.

40|$|Results of an {{exploratory}} free-flight investigation at zero lift of several rocket-powered drag-research models having tapered k-percent-thick wings are presented for a Mach number rangk of 0. 7 to 1. 6.

The sections were identical circular arcs {{back to the}} kO-percent-chord station. The remainder of the section was formed by drawing a tangent from the trailing edges of various thicknesses to the extended circular arc. The data obtained indicated that {{an increase in the}} ratio of trailing-edge thickness to maximum thickness caused a corresponding increase in <b>wing</b> <b>drag</b> coefficient throughout the Mach number range investigated,which was due to the increased area over which the base suction acts.
