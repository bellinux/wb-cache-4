5|$|Historians {{have often}} {{referred}} to Conroy as someone with strong ambition, {{with varying degrees of}} positive or negative opinion. Rumours circulated during and after his lifetime that he was perhaps the Duchess of Kent's lover. Queen Victoria <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> to hear this, stating that her mother's piety would have prevented it.|$|E
5|$|After leaving Oxford, Hogg {{was sent}} to York to serve a legal apprenticeship. Timothy Shelley was furious when he learned of the expulsion, but John Hogg was not minded to {{discipline}} his son or to forbid him from associating with Percy Shelley. Prudentia Hogg, who was an Evangelical Christian, <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> when she learned that her son was promoting atheism. She was further angered when she learned that her son had become a vegetarian, a decision that she attributed to Shelley's corrupting influence.|$|E

5|$|Cockcroft <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> {{when he was}} {{informed}} on 10 September 1945 that the British physicist Alan Nunn May, {{who worked at the}} Chalk River Laboratories, was a Soviet spy. In August 1947, Cockcroft was one of the scientists who signed a petition urging that Nunn May's ten-year prison sentence be reduced, an act he later regretted.|$|E
5|$|Feuchtwanger {{was horrified}} and incensed {{at the way}} in which his work had been {{manipulated}} and distorted, calling Harlan's film a Schandwerk ("a shameful work"). In 1941, he wrote an open letter to seven actors. Based on the sentiments expressed in the letter, it appears that Feuchtwanger <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> that these men, whom he considered colleagues and who he knew were familiar with his work, would agree to participate in Goebbels' antisemitic propaganda film.|$|E
5|$|Hesketh-Prichard <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> {{to learn}} of the high {{attrition}} rate due to well-trained German snipers. It was common for British regiments to lose five men a day to snipers; he learned that one battalion lost eighteen in a single day. The German snipers could not be located, leaving them free to continue shooting from their place of concealment. He was also dismayed by the poor quality of marksmanship amongst the British troops.|$|E

5|$|Meyerbeer died in Paris on 2 May 1864. Rossini, who, {{not having}} heard the news, {{came to his}} {{apartment}} the next day intending to meet him, <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> and fainted. He was moved to write on the spot a choral tribute (Pleure, pleure, muse sublime!). A special train bore Meyerbeer's body from the Gare du Nord to Berlin on 6 May, where he {{was buried in the}} family vault at the Jewish cemetery in Schönhauser Allee.|$|E
5|$|Rotblat {{continued}} to have strong reservations {{about the use of}} science to develop such a devastating weapon. In 1985 he related that at a private dinner at the Chadwicks' house at Los Alamos in March 1944, he <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> to hear the director of the Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., say words to the effect that the real purpose in making the bomb was to subdue the Soviets. Historians, notably Barton Bernstein, have cast doubt on this story.|$|E
5|$|Suriname-born Milton Kam, who {{had shot}} 10 feature films {{and more than}} 50 short films, {{was chosen as the}} {{director}} of photography.

However, Kam helped him to stay composed during the production.|$|E

5|$|The Australian public <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> by {{the revelation}} by a turncoat Russian officer, {{who claimed that}} a direct {{engagement}} was secretly planned by Russia in case the Confederacy was recognised by Britain. The Russian navy had just paid Australia a visit in preparation for launching attacks. Fear of a possible military confrontation led to a massive buildup of coastal defences and to the acquisition of an ironclad warship.|$|E
5|$|At a Sunday {{church service}} in mid-December, in what Marshall {{believed}} {{was an attempt}} by other officials {{to force him to}} assume the presidency, a courier brought a message informing him that Wilson had died. Marshall <b>was</b> <b>shocked,</b> and rose to announce the news to the congregation. The ministers held a prayer, the congregation began singing hymns, and many people wept. Marshall and his wife exited the building, and made a call to the White House to determine his next course of action, only to find that he had been the victim of a hoax, and that Wilson was still living.|$|E

Trưởng <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> to discover, however, that the Airborne Division was to be removed to III Corps (unknown to Trưởng at the time, the Marine Division was also already slated for redeployment with both units then forming a new national reserve).|$|E

5|$|Barbauld's {{career as}} a poet ended {{abruptly}} in 1812 {{with the publication of}} Eighteen Hundred and Eleven, which criticised Britain's participation in the Napoleonic Wars. She <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> by the vicious reviews it received and published nothing else in her lifetime. Her reputation was further damaged when many of the Romantic poets she had inspired in the heyday of the French Revolution turned against her in their later, more conservative years. Barbauld was remembered only as a pedantic children's writer in the nineteenth century, and largely forgotten in the twentieth, but the rise of feminist literary criticism in the 1980s renewed interest in her works and restored her place in literary history.|$|E
5|$|Goldman {{found it}} {{difficult}} to acclimate to the German leftist community in Berlin. Communists despised her outspokenness about Soviet repression; liberals derided her radicalism. While Berkman remained in Berlin helping Russian exiles, Goldman moved to London in September 1924. Upon her arrival, the novelist Rebecca West arranged a reception dinner for her, attended by philosopher Bertrand Russell, novelist H. G. Wells, and more than 200 other guests. When she spoke of her dissatisfaction with the Soviet government, the audience <b>was</b> <b>shocked.</b> Some left the gathering; others berated her for prematurely criticizing the Communist experiment. Later, in a letter, Russell declined to support her efforts at systemic change in the Soviet Union and ridiculed her anarchist idealism.|$|E
5|$|However, Ladislaus {{could not}} restore royal power in Hungary. A papal legate, Philip, bishop of Fermo, came to Hungary to help Ladislaus {{consolidate}} his authority, but the prelate <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> at {{the presence of}} thousands of pagan Cumans in Hungary. Ladislaus promised that he would force them to adopt a Christian lifestyle, but they refused to obey the legate's demands. Ladislaus decided to support the Cumans, for which Philip of Fermo excommunicated him. The Cumans imprisoned the legate, and the legate's partisans captured Ladislaus. In early 1280, Ladislaus agreed to persuade the Cumans {{to submit to the}} legate, but many Cumans preferred to leave Hungary.|$|E

5|$|In 1931 Berni {{returned}} to Rosario where he briefly {{lived on a}} farm and was then hired as a municipal employee. The Argentina of the 1930s {{was very different from}} the Paris of the 1920s. He witnessed labor demonstrations and the miserable effects of unemployment and <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> by the news of a military coup d'état in Buenos Aires (see Infamous Decade). Surrealism didn't convey the frustration or hopelessness of the Argentine people. Berni organized Mutualidad de Estudiantes y Artistas and {{became a member of the}} local Communist party.|$|E
5|$|In August 1941, Mark Oliphant, the {{director}} of the physics department at the University of Birmingham and an original member of the MAUD Committee, was sent to the US to assist the NDRC on radar. During his visit he met with William D. Coolidge. Coolidge <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> when Oliphant informed him that the British had predicted that only ten kilograms of uranium-235 would be sufficient to supply a chain reaction effected by fast moving neutrons. While in America, Oliphant discovered that the chairman of the OSRD S-1 Section, Lyman Briggs, had locked away the MAUD reports transferred from Britain entailing the initial discoveries and had not informed the S-1 Committee members of all its findings.|$|E
5|$|In September 1883 he went as a boarder to Field House Preparatory School in Rottingdean on {{the south}} coast of England, forty miles from Wotton. He was {{generally}} happy there, although he <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> to encounter {{for the first time}} social snobbery and political conservatism which were rife among his fellow pupils. From there he moved on to the public school Charterhouse in January 1887. His academic and sporting achievements there were satisfactory, and the school encouraged his musical development. In 1888 he organised a concert in the school hall, which included a performance of his G major Piano Trio (now lost) with the composer as violinist.|$|E
