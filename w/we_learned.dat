Not many years passed of your conventional life, and you were never in the choir, always in private houses, so that the laity observed you. You were deprived of your professorship, we own it; you were prohibited from preaching and hearing confessions; you were obliged to give hush-money to the father of one of your victims, as <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> from an official document of the Neapolitan Police to be 'known for habitual incontinency;' your name came before the civil tribunal at Corfu for your crime of adultery.

500|$|The game uses an {{optimized}} {{version of}} the Dinosaur Hunter engine, which allowed developers to create environments with more complex geometry and incorporate a lighting system where light sources could cast shadows on objects in real-time. The game's distance fog was reduced and disguised as an atmospheric effect, resulting in players {{being able to see}} five time as far than they could in the original game. The game's progression, focus on exploration and mission objectives were inspired by the Mario and Zelda franchises. As Dienstbier explained, [...] "That's something that <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> from Miyamoto: Start things off simple and gradually add to it as you progress. Later objectives will make far more use of the dynamic environments." [...] Unlike the original game, where levels shared graphic assets, Seeds of Evil features unique levels with different geometry, textures and enemies.|$|E

[...] Kelly Staskel of Billboard felt that [...] "stately drums and dramatic strings" [...] are paired with lyrics that take on a [...] "stark, apocalyptic tone", referring to the last verse of the song, which says [...] "The age of man is over / A darkness comes and all / These lessons that <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> here / Have only just begun".

500|$|Both EA and Sega {{released}} multitaps {{to allow}} more than the standard two players to play at once. [...] Initially, EA's version, the 4 Way Play, and Sega's adapter, the Team Player, only supported each publisher's titles. In response to complaints about this, Sega publicly stated that [...] "We have been working hard to resolve this problem since <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> of it" [...] and that a new Team Player which would work with all multitap games for the console would be released shortly. Later games were created to work on both the 4 Way Play and Team Player. Codemasters also developed the J-Cart system, providing two extra ports on the cartridge itself, although the technology came late in the console's life and is only featured on a few games. Sega planned to release a steering wheel peripheral in 1994, and the Genesis version of Virtua Racing was advertised as being [...] "steering wheel compatible," [...] but the peripheral was cancelled.|$|E

500|$|Elements of {{the book}} were rewritten while several songs {{underwent}} minor transformations. This included the excision of [...] "Which Way is the Party?", the introductory song to the character Fiyero, which was subsequently replaced by [...] "Dancing Through Life" [...] in Schwartz's fear that the former failed to be a clear [...] "statement of Fiyero's philosophy of life". In addition, there was concern that Menzel's Elphaba [...] "got a little overshadowed" [...] by Chenoweth's Glinda. San Francisco Chronicle critic Robert Hurwitt wrote, [...] "Menzel's brightly intense Elphaba the Wicked Witch [...] a chance of holding her own alongside Chenoweth's gloriously, insidiously bubbly Glinda", so the creative team set about making her character [...] "more prominent". On {{the subject of the}} Broadway revisions, Schwartz recalled, [...] "It was clear there was work to be done and revisions {{to be made in the}} book and the score. The critical community was, frankly, very helpful to us. <b>We</b> <b>learned</b> a lot from the reviews, which were honest and constructive in the aggregate, unlike New York, where the critics make up their minds before they come to the theatre."

500|$|Even before {{viewing the}} script, Reznor and Ross opted {{to use a}} redolent {{approach}} to creating the film's score. After discussing with Fincher the varying soundscapes and emotions, the duo spent six weeks composing. [...] "We composed music we felt might belong," [...] stated the Nine Inch Nails lead vocalist, [...] "and then we'd run it by Fincher, to see where his head’s at and he responded positively. He was filming at {{this time last year}} and assembling rough edits of scenes to see what it feels like, and he was inserting our music at that point, rather than using temp music, which is how it usually takes place, apparently." [...] Finding a structure for the soundtrack was arguably the most strenuous task. [...] "We weren’t working on a finished thing, so everything keeps moving around, scenes are changing in length, and even the order of things are shuffled around, and that can get pretty frustrating when you get precious about your work. It was a lesson <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> pretty quickly of, 'Everything is in flux, and approach it as such. Hopefully it’ll work out in the end.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The brawling {{continued}} in 1990. During an August 9 game at Shea, Gooden hit Phillies hitters Dickie Thon and Tommy Herr.

Phillies outfielder Von Hayes defended Combs after the game, [...] "Gooden better expect retaliation if he keeps hitting guys with [...] fastballs. We've got to protect our players." [...] Gooden charged the mound and tackled Combs. Phillies catcher Darren Daulton followed Gooden and landed a series of punches {{on the back of}} Gooden's head. Darryl Strawberry had been in the Mets clubhouse and rushed the field after Daulton but was himself blindsided by Hayes. Of Daulton, Gooden later said, [...] "Daulton was the guy we wanted most. He's a cheap-shot artist. <b>We</b> <b>learned</b> that about him last year", referring to the September 1989 fight. Six players and Phillies coach Mike Ryan were ejected from the game.

In another episode, Jack's mother tells him that Liz is a perfect match for him, {{and in the same}} episode he has Liz listed as his emergency contact.
