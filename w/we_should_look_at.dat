[...] Composer Yasunori Mitsuda {{was pleased with the}} project, exclaiming [...] "finally!" [...] after receiving the news from Square Enix and maintaining, [...] "it's still a very deep, very high-quality game even when you play it today. I'm very interested in seeing what kids today think about it when they play it." [...] Square retained Masato Kato to oversee the port, and Tose to program it. Kato explained, [...] "I wanted it {{to be based on the}} original Super NES release rather than the PlayStation version. I thought <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the additional elements from the Playstation version, re-examine and re-work them to make it a complete edition. That’s how it struck me and I told the staff so later on." [...] Square Enix touted the game by displaying Akira Toriyama's original art at the 2008 Tokyo Game Show.|$|E
2500|$|We {{are better}} advised, writes Penelope Curtis, [...] "to {{look at what}} is sculptural within Cubism. Cubist {{painting}} is an almost sculptural translation of the external world; its associated sculpture translates Cubist painting back into a semi-reality". Attempts to separate painting and sculpture, even by 1910, are very difficult. [...] "If painters used sculpture for their own ends, so sculptors exploited the new freedom too", writes Curtis, [...] "and <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> what sculptors took from the discourse of painting and why. In the longer term we could read such developments as the beginning of a process in which sculpture expands, poaching painting's territory and then others, to become steadily more prominent in this century".|$|E

I think the ordinary citizens of the former Soviet Union and the citizens in the post-Soviet space, the CIS countries, have gained nothing from it. On the contrary, people have been faced with a host of problems." [...] He went on to say, [...] "Incidentally, at that period, too, opinions varied, including among the leaders of the Union republics. For example, Nursultan Nazarbayev was categorically opposed to the dissolution of the Soviet Union and he said so openly proposing various formulas for preserving the state within the common borders. But, I repeat, all that is in the past. Today <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the situation in which we live. One cannot keep looking back and fretting about it: we should look forward." [...] In December 2007, he said in the interview to the Time magazine: [...] "Russia is an ancient country with historical, profound traditions and a very powerful moral foundation. And this foundation is a love for the Motherland and patriotism. Patriotism in the best sense of that word. Incidentally, I think that to a certain extent, to a significant extent, this is also attributable to the American people." ...|$|E

I remember how furious the coffee-house wits were with Dick Steele when he set up his coach and fine house in Bloomsbury: they began to forgive him when the bailiffs were after him, and abused Mr. Addison for selling Dick's country-house.

6000|$|In any serious, {{attempt to}} criticise [...] "Waverley" [...] as a whole, {{it is not}} easy to say whether we should try to put {{ourselves}} at the point of view of its first readers, or whether <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it from the vantage-ground of to-day. In 1811 the dead world of clannish localty was fresh in many memories. Scott's own usher had often spoken with a person who had seen Cromwell enter Edinburgh after Dunbar. He himself knew heroes of the Forty-five, and his friend Lady Louisa Stuart had been well acquainted with Miss Walkinshaw, sister of the mistress of Charles Edward. To his generation those things were personal memories, which to us seem as distant as the reign of Men-Ka-Ra. They could not but be [...] "carried off their feet" [...] by such pictures of a past still so near them. Nor had they other great novelists to weaken the force of Scott's impressions. They had not to compare him with the melancholy mirth of Thackeray, and the charm, the magic of his style. Balzac was of the future; of the future was the Scott of France,--the boyish, the witty, the rapid, the brilliant, the inexhaustible Dumas. Scott's generation had no scruples abort [...] "realism," [...] listened to no sermons on the glory of the commonplace; like Dr. Johnson, they admired a book which [...] "was amusing as a fairy-tale." [...] But we are overwhelmed with a wealth of comparisons, and deafened by a multitude of homilies on fiction, and distracted, like the people in the Erybyggja Saga, by the strange rising and setting, and the wild orbits of new [...] "weirdmoons" [...] of romance. Before we can make up our minds on Scott, we have to remember, or forget, the scornful patronage of one critic, the over-subtlety and exaggerations of another, the more than papal infallibility of a third. Perhaps the best critic would be an intelligent school-boy, with a generous heart and an unspoiled imagination. As his remarks are not accessible, as we must try to judge [...] "Waverley" [...] like readers inured to much fiction and much criticism, we must confess, no doubt, that the commencement has the faults which the first reviewers detected, and it which Scott acknowledged. He is decidedly slow in getting to business, as they say; he began with more of conscious ethical purpose than he went on, and his banter is poor. But when once we enter the village of Tully-Veolan, the Magician finds his wand. Each picture of place or person tells,--the old butler, the daft Davie Gellatley, the solemn and chivalrous Baron, the pretty natural girl, the various lairds, the factor Macwheeble,--all at once become living people, and friends whom we can never lose. The creative fire of Shakspeare lives again. The Highlanders--Evan Dhu, Donald Bean Lean, his charming daughter, Callum Beg, and all the rest--are as natural as the Lowlanders. In Fergus and Flora we feel, indeed, at first, that the author has left his experience behind, and is giving us creatures of fancy. But they too become human and natural,--Fergus in his moods of anger, ambition, and final courageous resignation; Flora, in her grief. As for Waverley, his creator was no doubt too hard on him. Among the brave we hear that he was one of the bravest, though Scott always wrote his battlepieces in a manner to suggest no discomfort, and does not give us particular details of Waverley's prowess. He has spirit enough, this [...] "sneaking piece of imbecility," [...] as he shows in his quarrel with Fergus, on the march to Derby. Waverley, that creature of romance, considered as a lover, is really not romantic enough. He loved Rose because she loved him,--which is confessed to be unheroic behaviour. Scott, in [...] "Waverley," [...] certainly does not linger over love-scenes. With Mr. Ruskin, we may say: [...] "Let it not be thought for an instant that the slight and sometimes scornful glance with which Scott passes over scenes, which a novelist of our own day would have analyzed with the airs of a philosopher, and painted with the curiosity of a gossip, indicates any absence in his heart of sympathy with the great and sacred elements of personal happiness." [...] But his mind entertained other themes of interest, [...] "loyalty, patriotism, piety." [...] On the other hand, it is necessary to differ from Mr. Ruskin when he says that Scott [...] "never knew 'l'amor che move 'l sol e l' altre stelle.'" [...] He whose heart was [...] "broken for two years," [...] and retained the crack till his dying day, he who, when old and tired, and near his death, was yet moved by the memory of the name which thirty years before he had cut in Runic characters on the turf at the Castle-gate of St. Andrew, knew love too well to write of it much, or to speak of it at all. He had won his ideal as alone the ideal can be won; he never lost her: she was with him always, because she had been unattainable. [...] "There are few," [...] he says, [...] "who have not, at one period of life, broken ties of love and friendship, secret disappointments of the heart, to mourn over,--and we know no book which recalls the memory of them more severely than 'Julia de Roubigne.'" [...] He could not be very eager to recall them, he who had so bitterly endured them, and because he had known and always knew [...] "l'amor che move 'l sol e l'altre stelle," [...] a seal was on his lips, a silence broken only by a caress of Di Vernon's.' ...|$|E
