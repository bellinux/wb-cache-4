5|$|Bewick {{made use}} of his close {{observation}} of nature, his remarkable visual memory, and his sharp eyesight to create accurate and extremely small details in his wood engravings, which proved to be both a strength and a weakness. If properly printed and closely examined, his prints could be seen to convey subtle clues {{to the character of}} his natural subjects, with humour and feeling. This was achieved by carefully varying the depth of the engraved grooves to provide actual greys, not only black and white, as well as the pattern of the marks to provide texture. But this subtlety of engraving created a serious technical difficulty for his printers; they needed to ink his blocks <b>with</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> amount of ink, mixed so as to be of exactly the right thickness, and to press the block to the paper slowly and carefully, to obtain a result that would satisfy Bewick. Not surprisingly, this made printing slow and expensive. It also created a problem for Bewick's readers; if they lacked his excellent eyesight, they needed a magnifying glass to study his prints, especially the miniature tail-pieces. But the effect was transformative, and wood engraving became the main method of illustrating books for a century. The quality of Bewick's engravings attracted a far wider readership to his books than he had expected: his Fables and Quadrupeds were at the outset intended for children.|$|E

Though the basic goal of making images from the same category closer than the ones from different categories is intuitive, {{it is hard to}} directly optimize due to the quadratic or cubic sample size. To solve the problem, hard example mining which only focuses on a subset of samples that are considered hard is widely used.

Instead of being presented with clear deductions, drawn from observation and experience, he sees but too plainly that, as each philosopher frames his own belief out of his inner consciousness, there cannot fail to come out a very large variety of beliefs, and that, if the religion of the Bible were exploded and became an obsolete thing, its place would be usurped by a motley crowd of infinitely varied creeds of every shape and hue, each claiming for itself, with more or less modesty and reserve, but <b>with</b> <b>just</b> equal <b>rights,</b> <b>the</b> supremacy over men's consciences.

2500|$|Within robotics, inverse {{dynamics}} algorithms {{are used}} to calculate the torques that a robot's motors must deliver to make the robot's end-point move in the way prescribed by its current task. The [...] "inverse dynamics problem" [...] in Robotics Engineering was solved by Eduardo Bayo in 1987. This solution calculates how each of the numerous electric motors that control a robot arm must move to produce a particular action. Humans can perform very complicated and precise movements, such as controlling the tip of a fishing rod well enough to cast the bait accurately. Before the arm moves, the brain calculates the necessary movement of each muscle involved and tells the muscles what to do as the arm swings. In the case of a robot arm, the [...] "muscles" [...] are the electric motors which must turn by a given amount at a given moment. Each motor must be supplied <b>with</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> amount of electric current, at just the right time. Researchers can predict the motion of a robot arm if they know how the motors will move. This is known as the forward dynamics problem. Until this discovery, they {{had not been able to}} work backwards to calculate the movements of the motors required to generate a particular complicated motion., Bayo's work began with the application of frequency-domain methods to the inverse dynamics of single-link flexible robots. This approach yielded non-causal exact solutions due to the right-half plane zeros in the hub-torque-to-tip transfer functions. Extending this method to the nonlinear multi-flexible-link case was of particular importance to robotics. When combined with passive joint control in a collaborative effort with a control group, Bayo's inverse dynamics approach led to exponentially stable tip-tracking control for flexible multi-link robots.|$|E
40|$|We {{examine how}} much {{information}} measured broad-line widths add to virial BH mass estimates for flux limited samples of quasars. We do this by comparing the BH mass estimates to those derived by randomly reassigning the quasar broad-line widths to different objects and re-calculating the BH mass. For 9000 BH masses derived from the H_beta line {{we find that the}} distributions of original and randomized BH masses in the M_BH-redshift plane and the M_BH-luminosity plane are formally identical. A 2 D KS test does not find a difference at > 90 % confidence. For the MgII line (32000 quasars) we do find very significant differences between the randomized and original BH masses, but the amplitude of the difference is still small. The difference for the CIV line (14000 quasars) is 2 - 3 sigma and again the amplitude of the difference is small. Subdividing the data into redshift and luminosity bins we find that the median absolute difference in BH mass between the original and randomized data is 0. 025, 0. 01 and 0. 04 dex for H_beta, MgII and CIV respectively. The maximum absolute difference is always <= 0. 1 dex. We investigate whether our results are sensitive to corrections to MgII virial masses (e. g. Onken & Kollmeier 2008). These corrections do not influence our results. Moreover, the mass residual - Eddington ratio correlation discussed by Onken & Kollmeier is more directly attributable to the slope of the relation between H_beta and MgII line width. Our results imply that the measured quasar broad-line velocity widths provide little extra information, after allowing for the mean velocity width. In this case virial estimates are equivalent to M_BH L^alpha, with L/L_edd L^(1 -alpha) (with alpha~ 0. 5). This leaves an unanswered question of why the accretion efficiency changes <b>with</b> luminosity in <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> way to keep the mean broad-line widths fixed as a function of luminosity.

40|$|Frequency scaling in {{traditional}} computing systems {{has hit the}} power wall and multicore computing is here to stay. Unlike homogeneous multicores which have uniform architecture and instruction set across cores, heterogenous multicores have differentially capable cores to provide optimal performance for specialized functionality. However, this heterogeneity also translates into difficult programming models, and extracting its potential is not trivial. The Cell Broadband Engine by the Sony Toshiba IBM(STI) consortium was amongst the first heterogenous multicore systems with a single Power Processing Unit(PPU) and 8 Synergistic Processor Units (SPUs). We {{address the issue of}} porting an existing sequential C/C++ codebase on to the Cell BE through compiler driven program analysis and profiling. Until parallel programming models evolve, the "interim" solution to performance involves speeding up legacy code by offloading computationally intense parts of a sequential thread to the co-processor; thus using it as an accelerator. Unique architectural characteristics of an accelerator makes this problem quite challenging. On the Cell, these characteristics include limited local store of the SPU, high latency of data transfer between PPU and SPU, lack of branch prediction unit, limited SIMDizability, expensive scalar code etc. In particular, the designers of the Cell have opted for software controlled memory on its SPUs to reduce power consumption and to give programmers more control over the predictability of latency. The lack of a hardware cache on the SPU can create performance bottlenecks because any data that needs to be brought in to the SPU must be brought in using a DMA call. The need for supporting a software controlled cache is thus evident for irregular memory accesses on the SPU. For such a cache to result in improved performance, {{the amount of time spent}} in book-keeping and tracking at run-time should be minimal. Traditional algorithms like LRU, when implemented in software incur overheads on every cache hit because appropriate data structures need to be updated. Such overheads are on off critical path for traditional hardware cache but on the critical path for a software controlled cache. Thus there is a need for better management of "data movement" for the code that is offloaded on to the SPU. This thesis addresses the "code partitioning" problem as well as the "data movement" problem. We present GLIMPSES - a compiler driven profiling tool that analyzes existing C/C++ code for its suitability for porting to the Cell, and presents its results in an interactive visualizer. Software Controlled Cache - an improved eviction policy that exploits information gleaned from memory traces generated through offline profiling. The trace is analyzed to provide guidance for a run-time state machine within the cache manager; resulting in reduced run-time overhead and better performance. The design tradeoffs and several pros and cons of this approach are brought forth as well.

5000|$|There are {{two methods}} of landing. [...] "Wheeler" [...] landing {{involves}} pushing the plane {{on to the}} runway at a moderate speed <b>with</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> main wheels on the ground, with the tail held up until speed reduces. It does not tend to bounce. Unlike most tail draggers, slow speed three point landings are quite difficult because {{there is not enough}} elevator authority to bring the tail down to the correct three point attitude. This means that the tail needs to be brought down sharply at <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> speed in order for the angular momentum to carry it down sufficiently.|$|R
