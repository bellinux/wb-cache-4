5|$|The MSS was {{manufactured}} by Hughes Aircraft Company. The sensor {{was considered an}} experimental sensor, and was the secondary sensor, until scientists reviewed the data that was beamed back to Earth.

5|$|Another taxon that Czerkas {{assigned}} to the pterosauria and named Utahdactylus <b>was</b> <b>reviewed</b> by Dr. Chris Bennett. Bennett found multiple misidentifications of bones and inconsistencies between Czerkas' diagrams and the actual fossils. Bennett found the specimen to be an indeterminate diapsid and criticized the previous authors for publishing a species name when no diagnostic characters below the class level could be verified. He made Utahdactylus a nomen dubium.|$|E
5|$|Coffelt's account <b>was</b> <b>reviewed</b> by the FBI, which {{concluded}} that it differed in significant details from information {{that had not been}} made public, and was therefore a fabrication. Brown, undeterred, continued peddling the story long after Coffelt died in 1975. Multiple media venues, including the television news program 60 Minutes, considered and rejected it. In a 2008 book about Lincoln's descendants, author Charles Lachman revisited Coffelt's tale although it had been discredited 36 years before.|$|E
5|$|In January 1981, the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) {{planted a}} bomb in the Suvla barrack block at RAF Uxbridge. The device was {{discovered}} and the 35RAF musicians and 15airmen living there were evacuated before it exploded. Following the incident, an enquiry began and security at all RAF stations <b>was</b> <b>reviewed.</b> The following year, many RAF personnel from the station were deployed during the Falklands War. The station went on to celebrate its 70th anniversary in 1987 by staging several events that raised £30,000 for the RAF Benevolent Fund.|$|E
30|$|The {{ground contact}} {{pressure}} <b>is</b> <b>reviewed</b> {{in the order}} of the maximum reaction of the outrigger, the working direction and height, and the impact load.

5|$|In {{identifying}} the remains {{as those of}} Palaeoscincus, Broom initially classified Paranthodon as an ankylosaurian, a statement backed {{by the research of}} Coombs in the 1970s. However, in 1929, Nopcsa identified the taxon as a stegosaurid, with which most modern studies agree. In 1981, the genus <b>was</b> <b>reviewed</b> with modern taxonomy, and found to be a valid genus of stegosaurid. However, a more recent 2008 review of Stegosauria could only identify one distinguishing feature, and while that study still referred it to Stegosauridae based on similarity, no diagnostic features of the family could be identified in Paranthodon.|$|E
5|$|The 2010 third edition <b>was</b> <b>reviewed</b> in Lemur News by Alex Dunkel. He {{praised the}} {{increased}} {{level of detail}} in the new edition, which adds additional information on geology, the history of lemur research, and numerous aspects of lemur biology. Efforts to conserve lemurs have faced steep challenges, Dunkel wrote, due to political and economic instability in Madagascar, and these challenges make the new edition especially important. However, he worried that the increased size of the book made it less portable than its predecessors.|$|E

5|$|The album <b>was</b> <b>reviewed</b> {{positively}} at {{the time}} of its release and subsequent reviews have remained highly favorable. Negative comments have concentrated on differences in playing style among the three musicians, brought about by the generational gap between Ellington and the others, and an argument that led to Mingus leaving the studio mid-session. Hundreds of musicians have been influenced by the recording, in particular by the freedom of individual expression within a small-group setting.|$|E
5|$|The {{author of}} the change which {{introduced}} Heartbleed, Robin Seggelmann, stated that he missed validating a variable containing a length and denied any intention to submit a flawed implementation. Following Heartbleed's disclosure, Seggelmann suggested focusing on the second aspect, stating that OpenSSL is not reviewed by enough people. Although Seggelmann's work <b>was</b> <b>reviewed</b> by an OpenSSL core developer, the review was also intended to verify functional improvements, a situation making vulnerabilities much easier to miss.|$|E
