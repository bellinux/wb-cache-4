50|$|In {{common with}} many communities, a {{historical}} development of parish constables formed {{the system of}} law enforcement for many centuries. In the nineteenth century the people of Guernsey complained that this system was inadequate for a growing population, and a professional police force was demanded. The parish constables retained their historic role, but from 1853 uniformed 'Assistant Constables' were appointed. Initially there were four of them, with a uniform hat and belt worn over their civilian clothing. They provided full-time policing, {{under the authority of}} the elected parish constables. The current police force was formed following approval by the States of Deliberation in March 1915, consisting of an inspector, two sergeants, two corporals and eleven constables. During the five year German occupation of the Channel Islands the Police had a difficult time whilst working alongside the German military police and the Feldgendarmerie (Field Police). In 1945 the force resumed its normal role and is now considerably expanded, as of 2015 it had 147 Officers. These are supported by 79 civilian staff, who work in roles <b>where</b> <b>warranted</b> Officers are not required.|$|E
5000|$|Critics of the FEC, {{including}} {{campaign finance}} reform supporters such as Common Cause and Democracy 21, have complained {{that it is a}} classic example of regulatory capture where it serves the interests of the ones it was intended to regulate. The FEC's bipartisan structure, which was established by Congress, renders the agency [...] "toothless." [...] Critics also claim that most FEC penalties for violating election law come well after the actual election in which they were committed. Additionally, some critics claim that the commissioners tend to act as an arm of the [...] "regulated community" [...] of parties, interest groups, and politicians when issuing rulings and writing regulations. Others point out, however, that the commissioners rarely divide evenly along partisan lines, and that the response time problem may be endemic to the enforcement procedures established by Congress. To complete steps necessary to resolve a complaint - including time for defendants to respond to the complaint, time to investigate and engage in legal analysis, and finally, <b>where</b> <b>warranted,</b> prosecution - necessarily takes far longer than the comparatively brief period of a political campaign.|$|E
50|$|Dense graded {{mixtures}} {{are currently}} designed with a Texas Gyratory Compactor (TGC). The TGC has {{a relatively high}} compactive effort and unlike the Superpave Gyratory Compactor (SGC), the TGC compactive effort can not be varied to match the intended application. Therefore, the TGC tends to produce a dry lean mix regardless of the application. Ideally, one would want to design a richer mix for a low volume/low demand roadway and a leaner mix for a high volume/high demand roadway. More asphalt in the mix {{reduces the risk of}} cracking and less asphalt reduces the risk of rutting. It is possible to increase or decrease the amount of asphalt in the mixture by adjusting the target laboratory molded density down or up from the standard value of 96.0%. Seldom is the target lab density adjusted down from the standard of 96.0%; however, it is common practice to adjust the target laboratory molded density up to 97.0% or higher in order to get more asphalt into the mixture. This practice is acceptable and actually encouraged <b>where</b> <b>warranted.</b> However, some mixtures may become susceptible to rutting if they contain too much asphalt especially if the asphalt is relatively soft such a PG 64 -22, etc.|$|E
