500|$|While {{accompanying}} Songz on 106 & Park when promoting, Ready, Drake {{explained the}} video, stating: [...] "The {{concept of the}} video {{is the fact that}} 'successful,' it applies to so many people that me and Trey just <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> point across that we see ourselves and we see success in other individuals so really, it's a video about potential. It's a video about understanding that no matter what you do, there's a way to be successful doing it. It's one of those motivational videos. It actually ends with a quote from Barack Obama which {{is one of my favorite}} quotes I've ever read, so we decided to put it in the video. It's vivid." ...|$|E
500|$|In the episode, Homer and his {{children}} {{want to see the}} unveiling of a new Funtendo console called Zii Zu, which is a reference to Nintendo's Wii U console. As he and the children make their way through the crowded convention to get to the unveiling, the screen turns into a first-person shooter game through the eyes of Homer. He uses Frisbees and a fire extinguisher as weapons to get forward. According to Selman, the inspiration for this came from the fact that [...] "if you've been to E3, you know it's insane, it's super-crowded, it's super-loud, and walking through it feels like a video game, like a nightmarish first-person video game of bloggers and nerds. You just <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> thing that you want to get to." ...|$|E
500|$|Abrams {{asked her}} {{to play the role}} because he had seen her {{previous}} work and liked it. Saldana had never seen the original series, though she had played a Trekkie in The Terminal (2004), but agreed to play the role after Abrams complimented her. [...] "For an actor, that's all you need, that's all you <b>want.</b> <b>To</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> acknowledgment and respect from your peers," [...] she said. She met with Nichelle Nichols, who explained to her how she had created Uhura's background and had named the character. Saldana's mother was a Star Trek fan and sent her voice mails during filming, giving advice on the part. Sydney Tamiia Poitier also auditioned for the part. The film officially establishes the character's first name, which had never been previously uttered on TV or in film. It also establishes (in an officially discreet manner) that Uhura and Spock are, in fact, lovers and had been romantically linked for some time during the film.|$|E

500|$|In Super Street Fighter IV, the {{developers}} attempted to retain Ibuki's playstyle and feel from Street Fighter III. She was also given a super jump (the only character, other than C. Viper, {{to have one}} in this game) and made adjustments to have combos that utilize it. Capcom's Taketoshi Sano said that [...] "Ibuki is suited to those who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> most out of a single character" [...] and [...] "beginners can use her too, but if I had to pick I'd say she's suited for intermediate." [...] Capcom Europe described Ibuki’s [...] "Raida" [...] ("Thunder Strike") command grab as having some unique properties and {{being one of the}} most powerful moves in the game. According to an MTV guide, Ibuki is [...] "one of the hardest characters to master in this latest iteration" [...] and players need to gain [...] "a strong understanding of each character's moves and abilities before truly coming to grips with what the weak, yet versatile Ibuki has to offer." ...|$|E
500|$|On February 21, 2014, Mayor Harpole {{spoke about}} the refugee {{population}} in Amarillo. According to 2007-2012 State Department data from U.S. Representative Mac Thornberry, Amarillo received {{the highest number of}} refugees per capita than any other Texas city. According to Harpole, the city has struggled with accommodating a high number of foreign language speakers in areas like education and 911 response. Harpole told the Texas Tribune, [...] "We’ve raised some red flags and said this isn’t good for some entities in the city or for the refugees themselves". Many refugees worked in meatpacking plants in the area, but Harpole expressed concern that jobs were declining and believed [...] "it’s going to be more difficult for the refugees to do well" [...] in Amarillo. After requests from Harpole, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission agreed with various refugee resettlement organizations in late 2013 that new placements in Amarillo would be limited to family reunification. However, Harpole wished to make clear, [...] "We don’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> idea out that we are not supportive of refugees. We’ve been very accepting. But we also need to keep it in a ratio that's healthy for the refugees as well as the residents".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} visit to North Korea by a senior American {{official}} in over five years, Hill flew into Pyongyang on June 21, 2007 for a two-day visit where he was warmly greeted by Ri Gun, the North's deputy nuclear negotiator at the airport. [...] "We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> six-party process moving", Mr. Hill said. [...] "We {{hope that we can}} make up for some of the time that we lost this spring, and so I’m looking forward to good discussions about that." [...] The visit had been organized in secrecy. Hill had been visiting Tokyo and flew to South Korea and then on to Pyongyang on a small jet. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice informed regional allies Japan and South Korea just before Hill's departure from Tokyo.|$|E

2500|$|On October 4, 2017, Jágr {{signed a}} one-year {{deal with the}} Calgary Flames. Jágr had {{indicated}} before {{that he would like}} to play professionally until he is 50 years old, but later stated it is very likely he will stop playing after this season, at which point he will only be 46. He noted the tendency of teams to focus on younger players to the exclusion of older ones like himself, which he considers understandable and in light of which he remarked, [...] "I was pretty lucky." [...] The Flames represent Jágr's ninth NHL team, but his first Canadian team; he said, [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> experience so I can one day say I played for a Canadian team. So I’m here." [...] On November 9th, Jagr scored his first goal as a Flame, and first ever for a Canadian team, playing against the Detroit Red Wings.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2007, a {{resolution}} was approved in the House of Representatives opposing President George W. Bush's plan to increase troop levels in Iraq. Bachmann voted [...] "No". However, before supporting the proposed surge, Bachmann {{called for a}} full hearing, saying, [...] "The American people deserve to hear and understand the merits of increasing U.S. troop presence in Iraq. Increased troop presence is justifiable if that measure would bring a swift conclusion to a difficult conflict." [...] She hesitated to give a firm endorsement, calling the hearings [...] "a good first step in explaining to the American people the course toward victory in Iraq". When pressed, {{she said she had}} not come to any conclusion on the matter, saying, [...] "I don't believe we have all of the information in front of us. As a member of Congress that's why I want to go to Iraq as quickly as I can. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> best information in front of me." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 2006, MacKenzie {{returned}} to The Sun, {{this time as}} a columnist, where he was accused using one of his columns to launch {{an attack on the}} people of Scotland (see below). On the subject of the columns themselves, he has said [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> Lonsdale Belt for vile and be personally rude to as many people as possible." [...] In June 2011, it was announced that MacKenzie would leave The Sun to write a column for the Daily Mail. It emerged in December 2016, during a civil case, that he had left The Sun because Rebekah Brooks, then head of News International, and Dominic Mohan, then editor of The Sun, had not told him of the extent of the company's phone hacking scandal. MacKenzie was also concerned about their employment of Jeremy Clarkson whose privacy injunction against his ex-wife was then in force. However he left the Mail in July 2012 after writing for the title for one year, citing an [...] "increased commercial workload". Subsequently, The Guardian reported that MacKenzie's departure was due to disagreements regarding the editing of his column.|$|E

2500|$|Georgia, however, {{responded with}} a thinly veiled threat at a lawsuit. The owners {{eventually}} acquiesced to her demands, wary of going through a long, protracted legal battle. Tagliabue simply stated that [...] "The desire to have peace and not be at war was a big factor" [...] in allowing the Rams move to go forward. In {{a matter of a}} month, the vote had gone from 21–6 opposed to 23–6 in favor, with the Raiders, who would leave the Coliseum and return to Oakland in 1995, abstaining. Jonathan Kraft, son of Patriots owner Robert Kraft, elaborated on the commissioner's remarks by saying that [...] "about five or six owners didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> other owners into litigation, so they switched their votes." [...] Only six franchises remained in opposition to the Rams move from Los Angeles: the Pittsburgh Steelers, New York Giants, New York Jets, Buffalo Bills, Arizona Cardinals (who played in St. Louis from 1960-87), and Washington Redskins. After the vote was over, Dan Rooney publicly stated that he opposed the move of the Los Angeles Rams because [...] "I believe we should support the fans who have supported us for years." ...|$|E
2500|$|Facing a Dallas {{defense that}} had allowed its {{previous}} six opponents {{an average of}} less than ten points per game, the Buccaneers were in immediate trouble. Doug Williams was sacked on the game's very first play. Field position was a problem, with the Buccaneers' first-half drives starting {{at an average of}} the 19-yard line. Tampa Bay was only able to advance beyond midfield four times during the entire game, and Williams was pressured into mistakes by a constant Dallas pass rush. The ground game was held to only 2 yards in the second half, with James Owens starting at running back in place of the injured Jerry Eckwood. The Dallas front four of Ed [...] "Too Tall" [...] Jones, Harvey Martin, Randy White, and John Dutton dominated the Buccaneers' offensive line, moving them backwards with 59 yards in sacks and forcing two intentional grounding penalties. They batted down several of Williams' passes, and Jones caught one of Williams' four interceptions. Tom Landry said that it was the best performance by a Dallas front four since their Super Bowl XII victory over Denver in 1978, and credited their intensity for the difference. Interceptions by Jones and Michael Downs set up two third-quarter touchdowns, helping the Cowboys to match their largest-ever margin of victory. Dallas committed no turnovers, and all tipped passes wound {{up in the hands of}} Cowboys players. It was the last time that an NFL playoff team had been shut out since the Buccaneers' NFC Championship loss to the Los Angeles Rams in the 1979 postseason. McKay had few comments after the game, telling the press, [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> hell out of here".|$|E
