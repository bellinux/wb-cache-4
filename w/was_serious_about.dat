5|$|In January 1950, Douglas opened {{campaign}} headquarters in Los Angeles and San Francisco, which {{was seen as}} a signal that she <b>was</b> <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> contesting Downey's seat and would not withdraw from the race. Downey challenged Douglas to a series of debates; Douglas, who was not a good debater, declined. The two candidates traded charges via press and radio, with Downey describing Douglas's views as extremist.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{official}} government statement that allowed {{for freedom of}} the press, {{this was the first}} trial of whether or not Dubček <b>was</b> <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> reforms. Goldstucker suffered no repercussions, and Dubček instead began to build a sense of trust among the media, the government, and the citizens. It was under Goldstücker that the journal's name was changed to Literární listy, and on 29 February 1968, the Writers’ Union published the first copy of the censor-free Literární listy. By August 1968, Literární listy had a circulation of 300,000, making it the most published periodical in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Defying the king, between 12February and 20April 1642, each county {{delegation}} of England in Commons chose two divines, {{in addition to}} two for each county of Wales, four for London, and two for each University (Oxford and Cambridge). County delegations often chose divines from their own county, but not always. Commons chose the members in this {{way to ensure that}} their local constituencies were represented in the decision. The House of Lords, Parliament's upper house, added another fourteen names on 14May, to which Commons agreed. Meanwhile, relations continued to deteriorate between the king and Parliament. Charles raised the royal standard at Nottingham on 22August, marking the beginning of the First English Civil War. The start of the war lent support to the cause of the Assembly in Parliament, because holding it would convince the Scots that Parliament <b>was</b> <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> reforming the church and induce the Scots to come to their aid. On the other hand, the war added strain to the already busy Parliament.|$|E

25|$|The album's {{title was}} {{intended}} to have a double meaning: that the music business is a hard one, and that the band <b>was</b> <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> its music ("The Firm mean business").

500|$|The letter {{challenges}} the Ireland's parliament to investigate how Wood originally attained the patent, {{even though most}} in power knew that the patent {{was the result of}} bribery. Although nothing new would be discovered in an investigation, the letter served the purpose of trying to unite the people of Ireland to fight for further economic freedom. The Drapier refers to Ireland's lack of economic freedom when he claims, the Irish [...] "are altogether Losers, and England a Gainer". Swift's intentions behind the letter are uncertain, and some critics believe that Swift did not desire such an investigation into Wood's supporters while others contend that Swift <b>was</b> <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> promoting a public inquiry into the matter.|$|E

500|$|Although born in Austria, {{and brought}} up in Italy and Germany, he {{enrolled}} in the United Kingdom's Royal Navy {{at the age of}} fourteen. Queen Victoria and her son King Edward VII, when Prince of Wales, occasionally intervened in his career: the Queen thought that there was [...] "a belief that the Admiralty are afraid of promoting Officers who are Princes on account of the radical attacks of low papers and scurrilous ones". However, Louis welcomed assignments that provided opportunities for him to acquire the skills of war and to demonstrate to his superiors that he <b>was</b> <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> his naval career. Posts on royal yachts and tours arranged by the Queen and Edward actually impeded his progress, as his promotions were perceived as royal favours rather than deserved.|$|E

[...] A dinner hosted by Don Bradman at his Adelaide home in January 1963 for visiting state captains was later cited to suggest that Meckiff {{may have been a}} sacrificial offering.

[...] Ex-wife Ivana Trump doubted he would actually run.

500|$|One of {{the first}} tasks for the new army was to {{suppress}} the smuggling of slaves from Pangani on the mainland to the island of Pemba, north of Zanzibar. [...] The troops completed this mission, capturing several slavers and hindering the trade. [...] Mathews retired from the Royal Navy in June 1881 and was appointed Brigadier-General of Zanzibar. [...] In 1880, the Sultan dispatched a military force under Mathews to bring his unruly African mainland territories under control. [...] Mathews' expedition was initially intended to reach Unyanyembe but his men refused to march inland and, when made to do so, deserted in large numbers. [...] The expedition ended instead at Mamboya where a 60-man garrison was established. [...] This {{had been reduced to}} a mere handful of men by the mid-1880s but the expedition proved that the Sultan <b>was</b> <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> maintaining control of all of his possessions. [...] Mathews' men were also involved in several expeditions to halt the land-based slave trade which had developed once the seas became too heavily policed for the traders.|$|E
500|$|In 1210 King John fined Neville 1,000 marks {{because he}} had allowed Peter des Roches, the Bishop of Winchester, to enclose some hunting grounds without royal permission; {{although}} Roches {{was close to the}} king, his action was an infringement of the royal forests. Neville's large fine was probably a warning that the king <b>was</b> <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> enforcing the forest law; it was eventually rescinded. In 1213 Neville was placed in charge of the seaports along the southwest English coast from Cornwall to Hampshire, but some time in 1213 it appears that he fell from royal favour, although the circumstances are unknown. A fine of 6,000 marks was assessed on him for allowing two prisoners to escape, as well as other unrecorded offences, although the king did subsequently remit 1,000 marks of the fine. In 1215 Neville lost his office of chief forester. He was present at Runnymede for the signing of Magna Carta and was mentioned in the preamble as one of King John's councillors, as well as serving as a witness to the document. Roger of Wendover, a chronicler writing in 1211, listed Neville as one of King John's [...] "evil counsellors".|$|E

500|$|At the {{negotiations}} with the French, Warwick had intimated that King Edward was interested in a marriage arrangement with the French crown, the intended bride being Louis XI's sister-in-law, Bona, daughter of Louis, Duke of Savoy. This marriage was not to be, however, because in September 1464, Edward revealed that he was already married, to Elizabeth Woodville. The marriage caused great offence to Warwick: not only {{due to the fact}} that his plans had been sabotaged, but also the secrecy with which the king had acted. The marriage – contracted on 1May of the same year – was not made public before Warwick pressed Edward on the issue at a council meeting, and in the meanwhile Warwick had been unknowingly deceiving the French into believing the king <b>was</b> <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> the marriage proposal. For Edward the marriage may very well have been a love match, but in the long run he sought to build the Woodville family into a powerhouse independent of Warwick's influence. The marriage of Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville caused Warwick to lose his power and influence. He accused Elizabeth and, her mother Jacquetta, of witchcraft to try and restore the power that he had lost.|$|E

The following year, the Government decided to go ahead despite its fear of potential public disorder, as the idea enjoyed widespread support from the public and civil society groups. During a Parliamentary debate on the issue on 25 April 2000, opposition Member of Parliament Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam asked the Minister for Home Affairs Wong Kan Seng whether this was a [...] "mere show" [...] or whether the Government <b>was</b> <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> promoting free speech in Singapore. If the latter, he asked if the Minister would agree to an open debate with the Workers' Party of Singapore outside Parliament.
