2500|$|An {{amendment}} to article V, detailing the qualifications for {{membership of the}} society. Each donation of $10 to the society funds had formerly entitled the contributor to one voting share; the amendment limited membership to [...] "only men who are mature, active and faithful witnesses of Jehovah devoting full time to performance {{of one or more}} of its chartered purposes... or such men who are devoting part time as active presiding ministers or servants of congregations of Jehovah's witnesses". The amended article stipulated that [...] "a man who is found to be in harmony with the purposes of the Society and who possesses the above qualifications may be elected as a member upon being nominated by a member, director or officer, or upon written application to the president or secretary. Such members shall be elected upon a finding by the Board of Directors that he possesses the necessary qualifications and by receiving a majority vote of the members." [...] The amendment limited membership at any one time to between 300 and 500, including approximately seven residents of each of the 48 states of the US. It also introduced a clause providing for the suspension or expulsion of a member for wilfully violating the society's rules, or [...] "becoming out of harmony with any of the Society's purposes or any of its work or for <b>wilful</b> <b>conduct</b> prejudicial to {{the best interests of the}} Society and contrary to his duties as a member, or upon ceasing to be a full-time servant of the Society or a part-time servant of a congregation of Jehovah's witnesses".|$|E
60|$|Sandusky. Noon.--Great gloom here. As {{everyone}} predicted, Stevenson {{has already}} lost 600 {{men in the}} marshes {{at the mouth of}} the Sandusky, men simply sacrificed. His <b>wilful</b> <b>conduct</b> in not mounting the river, following on his melancholy defeat before Mar, and his long and fatal hesitation as to the Armies of the West and Centre, fill up the measure of his incapacity. His uncontrolled temper and undisguised incivility, not only to the Press, but to fellow-soldiers of the stamp of Piffle, have alienated from him even the sympathy that sometimes improperly consoles demerit.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Dear May, you, {{who know}} me {{better than the}} world, know well my heart is not a mass of ice; and you, who are ever so ready {{to find a good}} reason even for my most <b>wilful</b> <b>conduct,</b> and an excuse for my most irrational, will easily credit that, in interfering in an affair in which you are concerned, I am not {{influenced}} by an unworthy, an officious, or a meddling spirit. No, dear May! it is because I think it better for you that we should speak upon this subject that I have ventured to treat upon it. Perhaps I broke it in a crude, but, credit me, not in an unkind, spirit. I am well conscious I have a somewhat ungracious manner; but you, who have pardoned it so often, will excuse it now. To be brief, it is of your companion to that accursed fÃªte that I would speak.' ...|$|E
60|$|There {{was much}} in her <b>wilful</b> <b>conduct</b> that {{caused him to}} wince {{in the heart of}} him. He was appalled by the thought of her {{shoulder}} to shoulder with the drunken rabble of traders and beachcombers at Guvutu. It was bad enough for a clean, fastidious man; but for a young woman, a girl at that, it was awful. The theft of the Flibberty-Gibbet was merely amusing, though the means by which the theft had been effected gave him hurt. Yet he found consolation {{in the fact that the}} task of making Oleson drunk had been turned over to the three scoundrels. And next, and swiftly, came the vision of her, alone with those same three scoundrels, on the Emily, sailing out to sea from Guvutu in the twilight with darkness coming on. Then came visions of Adamu Adam and Noa Noah and all her brawny Tahitian following, and his anxiety faded away, being replaced by irritation that she should have been capable of such wildness of conduct.|$|E
