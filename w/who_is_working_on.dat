5|$|Film producer-director Elia Kazan hires James for {{the leading}} role in East of Eden (1955), marking his Hollywood debut. He moves to Hollywood in April 1954 to begin filming for Eden and is {{introduced}} to Jack L. Warner, the stern president of Warner Bros. Studios who is determined to transform him into a movie star. Warner becomes suspicious of his personal life (such as his possible bisexuality and passions for auto racing and motorcycling). On the Warner Bros. backlot, he {{falls in love with}} actress Pier Angeli, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> the neighboring production of The Silver Chalice (1954).|$|E

Assistant Director Walter Skinner tells Mulder, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> restoring the burned X-Files, that Mulder and Scully have been denied reassignment on the X-Files, but that Mulder should seek out a folder left on the desk in his old office. Mulder goes there, {{only to discover that}} Jeffrey Spender and Diana Fowley have been assigned to the X-Files. Feeling betrayed by Fowley, Mulder leaves, but not before stealthily taking the folder with him.|$|E
5|$|Kirill {{arrives at}} the {{workshop}} of Theophanes the Greek (Nikolai Sergeyev), a prominent and well-recognized master painter, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> a new icon of Jesus Christ. Theophanes is portrayed as a complex character: an established artist, humanistic and God-fearing in his views yet somewhat cynical, regarding his art more as a craft and a chore in his disillusion with other people. His young apprentices have all run away to the town square, where a wrongly convicted criminal {{is about to be}} tortured and executed. Kirill talks to Theophanes, and the artist, impressed by the monk's understanding and erudition, invites him to work as his apprentice on the decoration of the Cathedral of the Annunciation in Moscow. Kirill refuses at first, but then accepts the offer on the condition that Theophanes will personally come to the Andronikov Monastery and invite Kirill to work with him in front of all the fraternity and Andrei Rublev, who according to Theophanes' comments has some fame as an icon painter in the outside world.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} was conducted to determine the relationship between self-monitoring with academic procrastination in students <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> thesis at the Faculty of Psychology, University of Diponegoro. The population is 123 students {{with a sample of}} 60 students. Determination of the samples was done by using simple random sampling. Data collection tool in the study of academic procrastination is a scale consisting of 38 aitem (α =. 940) and self-monitoring scale consists of 25 aitem (α = 0. 924), which has been tested. The data obtained showed a correlation coefficient of - 0. 454 with p = 0. 000 (p < 0. 05), meaning that there is a significant negative relationship between self-monitoring with academic procrastination in students <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> thesis at the Faculty of Psychology, University of Diponegoro. The higher self-monitoring, the lower the academic procrastination in students <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> the thesis. Conversely, the lower the self-monitoring, the higher the academic procrastination in students <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> the thesis. Self-monitoring variables contribute effectively to academic procrastination by 20. 6 %, while 79. 4 % came from other factors that are not revealed in this study...|$|R

500|$|Republican Congresswoman Barbara Layton (Cherry Jones) {{starts a}} {{campaign}} against publicly funded NIH projects into sexual diseases. The attack {{is based on a}} list of seemingly useless projects, but by association, her real target becomes the president's daughter Ellie, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> a study into the Human papillomavirus that researched conditions for prostitutes in Puerto Rico. The President is infuriated at having a family member dragged into political battles, and Toby tries to discredit the attack by finding its source. At first the list seems to originate from a far-right group called the [...] "Traditional Values Alliance", but Toby's assistant Rena uncovers an updated list that shows it came from within the administration. Toby immediately suspects the Vice President's office. When confronted, Will takes full responsibility, and assures that the list was compiled purely for internal use and not leaked on purpose. Will suspects that his boss might have leaked the material on purpose, however, and Russell in private agrees he has ties to the Republicans on health issues and notes that having some distance from the President isn't a bad thing for him. Will is left utterly disgusted with the VP.|$|E
500|$|In the African journal, Mountstuart {{has become}} an English {{lecturer}} at the University College of Ikiri in Nigeria, from where he reports on the Biafran War. He retires to London on a paltry pension and, now an old man, he is knocked over by a speeding post office van. In hospital he brusquely refuses to turn to religion, swearing his atheism and humanism to a priest. He recovers but is now completely destitute. To boost his income and publicise the state of hospitals, he joins the Socialist Patients' Kollective (SPK), {{which turns out to}} be a cell of the Baader-Meinhof Gang. He becomes the SPK's prize newspaper seller and is sent on a special mission to the continent. [...] The trip ends with a brief interrogation by Special Branch, after which Mountstuart returns to his life of penury in London.

Throughout our career, we never did what anyone wanted us to do. We never made the records people wanted us to make. We never played by the rules people wanted us to play by. And here we are, 25 years later, still a band. Clearly that means something. And if we did ever play or make new music or anything, {{it would be a very}} big deal. And there's a lot of bands that I've seen come along during that 25-year period that did everything the record companies and the powers-that-be wanted them to do, and they sold millions of records. But where are they now? They're gone." [...] Morello added, [...] "Right now...the cold embers of Rage Against the Machine are now the burning fire of Prophets of Rage. Where Rage Against the Machine lives, is this summer in these songs that we are playing. And we have nothing but the greatest love and honor and respect for Zack de la Rocha, the brilliant lyricist of Rage Against the Machine, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> his own music, which I'm sure will be fantastic—he's a great artist in his own right.

2500|$|The most {{important}} {{point about the}} Act {{is that there is}} some confusion about whom it covers. Most British people will be covered, but often vulnerable workers are not. Under section 230 of the Act the word [...] "employee" [...] is defined to mean somebody with a [...] "contract of employment". This in turn means someone who has a [...] "contract of service". In legal cases since the early 1980s, some judges have placed a restrictive interpretation on what that means. The opposite of a [...] "contract of service" [...] is a [...] "contract for services", and it is meant to draw the line between someone who is working for another, on their account, under their control and someone <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> their own account, controlling their own work. In other words, it is meant to be the difference between the truly [...] "employed" [...] and the [...] "self employed".|$|E

The Professor then describes {{the nature of the}} bomb which he carries in his coat at all times: it allows him to press a button which will blow him up in twenty seconds, and those nearest to him.

Heat is a policeman <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> the case regarding a recent explosion at Greenwich, where one man was killed. [...] Heat informs The Professor that he is not a suspect in the case, but that he is being monitored due to his terrorist inclinations and anarchist background. Heat suspects Michaelis. Knowing that Michaelis has recently moved to the countryside to write a book, the Chief Inspector informs the Assistant Commissioner that he has a contact, Verloc, who may be able to assist in the case. The Assistant Commissioner shares some of the same high society acquaintances with Michaelis and is chiefly motivated by finding the extent of Michaelis's involvement in order to assess any possible embarrassment to his connections. He later speaks to his superior, Sir Ethelred, about his intentions to solve the case alone, rather than rely on the effort of Chief Inspector Heat.|$|E

60|$|That {{every one}} of those little black spots should have in it LIFE-- What is life? How did it get into that black spot? or, to speak more carefully, is the life IN the black spot at all?

Is that no miracle? Is it no miracle that not one of those black spots ever turns into anything save a frog? Why should not some of them turn into toads or efts? Why not even into fishes or serpents? Why not? The eggs of all those animals, in their first and earliest stages are exactly alike; the microscope shows no difference. Ay, even the mere animal and the human being, strange and awful as it may be, SEEM, under the microscope, to have the same beginning. And yet one becomes a mere animal, and the other a member of Christ, a child of God, and an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven. What causes this but the power of God, making of the same clay one vessel to honour and another to dishonour? And yet people will not believe in miracles! Why does each kind turn into its kind? Answer that. Because it is a law of nature? Not so! There are no laws OF nature. God is a law TO nature. It is his WILL that things so should be; and when it is his will they will not be so, but otherwise.|$|E
