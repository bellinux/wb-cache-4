5000|$|A <b>wash</b> <b>rack</b> is a partly {{enclosed}} [...] {{that is used}} to wash vehicles, heavy equipment, tools, {{and parts}} by removing dirt, grime, chemicals, invasive species, and other contaminants with a pressure washer in order to prevent corrosion and promote longer equipment lifespan. Cars, trucks, boats, construction and maintenance equipment, and even aircraft and military vehicles can all be cleaned in a <b>wash</b> <b>rack.</b> Wash racks are usually mobile and constructed from steel, although plastic wash racks exist as well as concrete formed alternatives which are sometimes installed in permanent facilities.|$|E
50|$|The term <b>wash</b> <b>rack</b> is {{also used}} to {{describe}} pads for washing horses. Wash racks for vehicle washing may be called closed-loop washing systems, heavy duty wash systems and degreasing pads.|$|E

50|$|According to statistics, <b>wash</b> <b>racks</b> help recycle {{thousands}} {{of gallons of}} water {{on a daily basis}} and are already part of many military construction projects around the world. Industrial water use was estimated at 18.5 billion gallons per day in the United States in 2005, a number that could be greatly reduced by using <b>wash</b> <b>racks</b> to recycle and reuse water.|$|R

5000|$|Mechanical Filtration {{addresses}} {{only two}} issues in <b>wash</b> <b>rack</b> wash water: suspended solids larger than 30 µm, and free {{oil and grease}}. Emulsified oil and grease cause damage to the media filters, resulting in very high maintenance costs. Electrocoagulation addresses any size of suspended solids (including destructive >30 µm particles and heavy metals that can wear-and-tear pressure washers and pose an environmental and employee hazard).|$|E
50|$|Many {{things had}} {{occurred}} within 1955 regarding car washing history. A businessman named Dan Hanna {{was encouraged by}} the car washers in Detroit, operated his own materials, then eventually made his own car wash called the Rub-a-Dub in Oregon. In 1957, he formed the Hanna Enterprises and eventually reached about 31 car washes in America. In 1959, Hanna operated his <b>wash</b> <b>rack</b> until he made the first mechanized car washing system. As the news spread throughout the city, so did his business.|$|E
5000|$|The 4950th Organizational Maintenance Squadron {{was located}} in {{building}} 4022, also known as [...] "Dock 2". Personnel assigned to the squadron were responsible for flight line maintenance including ground handling, refueling/defueling, launch and recovery, on-equipment maintenance, and inspections such as pre/post-flight and thru-flight inspections. The OMS consisted of large aircraft, small-aircraft, inspection, and support branches. OMS owned and operated buildings 4022 (command section, maintenance supervision, inspection branch, TO library, tool crib), 4026 (Aero-Repair hangar), 4024 (<b>wash</b> <b>rack)</b> and 4028 ("Dock 1" [...] and the large aircraft branch).|$|E

50|$|The Academy has an equestrian {{program with}} a barn {{available}} for students wishing to bring their own horses. The Academy is home to over thirty school-owned and privately owned horses. Sacred Heart Stables, center for the SSH equestrian studies division, features a fourteen stall barn {{in addition to the}} unique six stall barn that was built in 1886. The facility also includes two cement <b>wash</b> <b>racks,</b> two lighted, locking tack rooms, over 20 acre of fenced turn out, and three fully enclosed riding arenas.|$|R
5000|$|Wash racks {{are often}} called [...] "containment racks" [...] or [...] "containment pads" [...] because their {{purpose is to}} contain {{effluent}} which often consists of hazardous materials that have been dislodged from the wash subject, and prevent it from draining off {{into the ground and}} causing stormwater contamination. Instead, the waste water is pumped out of the <b>wash</b> <b>rack</b> and into some sort of filtration system which removes the contaminates then sends the water either back into the pressure washer for reuse or into a sanitary sewer.|$|E
50|$|Davenport Garage is a two storey {{building}} {{located at the}} north edge of the Hillcrest Complex with road access directly from Davenport Road to its second floor. When opened in 1925, it was the main garage for all gasoline-powered TTC vehicles. Later it also served Gray Coach vehicles. On the lower level, there was a repair shop with 10 repair pits and an area for storing parts and materials for bus maintenance. On the upper level, the garage had 4 inspection pits and a <b>wash</b> <b>rack.</b> The garage closed in 1993.|$|E

5000|$|John McGeoch (1990/91): “I don't think '9' was a bummer, {{but looking}} {{back with the}} luxury of hindsight, I'm more content with 'Happy?'. We in fact started to record '9' with Bill Laswell, but Bill was just out of order I'm afraid. Lydon sacked him on the second day. He {{wanted to make a}} heavy metal album. He had us round and it was nothing less than a lecture that he gave us, that the American public needed John Lydon to make a tough heavy metal album. The {{material}} that we had written for '9' was written on computers, as was the new stuff, and he said 'This is just disco!' He wanted to throw out Allan and Bruce and use his own musicians.” “When we recorded '9', the engineer Dave Meegan recorded a lot of it digitally, but then went and used my noisy old <b>washing</b> machine <b>rack</b> to master it, to get that analogue feel.” ...|$|R
50|$|Ecke faced {{significant}} problems preparing his research in wartime. There were few reference works to rely on, little money for research assistance, travel was dangerous, and printing resources few. Ecke took apart and measured the furniture {{in his own}} collection to give detailed drawings of its construction. Photographs, some full-page, and drawings by Ecke’s collaborator Professor Yang Yue, show the construction of beds, chairs, tables, wardrobes, <b>wash</b> stands, clothes <b>racks</b> and other domestic items. Chinese Domestic Furniture in Photographs and Measured Drawings was published in a limited portfolio edition of 200 copies in Beijing in 1944, then reprinted as a standard book by Tuttle in 1962 and Dover Publications in 1985. Kirkus Review The book was influential in its choice of topic and manner of treatment. The classical style of furniture came to dominate the tastes of American collectors after the war partly because of this Bauhaus influence which Ecke and other scholars trained in Europe conveyed.|$|R
50|$|The {{main purpose}} of a <b>wash</b> <b>rack</b> is to clean {{equipment}} while protecting the environment from contaminates commonly found on construction, maintenance and military vehicles or equipment. To comply with U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) regulations, which are intended to prevent soil-borne insects or other potentially harmful organisms from entering the United States, U.S. military vehicles and equipment must be thoroughly washed before being shipped home. As such, wash racks are commonly used by the US military to ensure vehicles are clean and safe before they are brought back into the country.|$|E
50|$|Major {{improvements}} to the installation increased its capability to support training. Another major range project, the Multi-Purpose Training Range, was completed; 250 miles of high quality road were constructed; a state-of-the-art <b>Wash</b> <b>Rack</b> facility, a new fuel facility, and an expanded Ammunition Supply Point enhanced the expanded maneuver area. Yakima Training Center provides training support for transient units and organizations by sustaining training lands, range complexes, and support facilities {{in order to enhance}} readiness. The installation's customers include not only the Joint Base Lewis-McChord and Army National Guard units, but also U.S. Special Operations Command, Marine Corps, Air Force, Navy, and Coast Guard units, plus local and federal law enforcement agencies and allied forces from Canada and Japan.|$|E
50|$|KCCB is a Class G (untowered) airport. Runway 1-19 is {{no longer}} in existence. In its place are some hangars, a fuel island, and a covered, lighted <b>wash</b> <b>rack.</b> Runway 6-24, now {{lengthened}} to 3865 ft, was recently resurfaced and is mostly flat, with some undulations on the east half. There is a terminal building with an FBO (flight school & rentals), aircraft repair shop, Maniac Mike's restaurant, and a control tower which is used to marshal aircraft during the annual Cable Air Show in January. (The tower is not normally used at any other time, as Cable is an uncontrolled airport.)This airport is also home to the Civil Air Patrol Squadron 25. The Cable family was nice enough to loan Civil Air Patrol their airport every Tuesday night from 6:30-9:00.Cable Airport is still owned by the Cable family. Based on number of aircraft based at the field (450), it ranks as the largest privately owned airport in the world.|$|E

5000|$|Stoker Company has {{supplied}} {{and applied}} pesticides since May 26, 1966. The Stoker Company sells, stores and applies pesticides using aircraft and ground equipment over a 26-acre site. Runoff from the cleaning of aircraft goes to underground concrete sumps located under each <b>wash</b> <b>rack.</b> Approximately once a week, the pesticide waters are pumped from the sumps into a mobile spray rig and sprayed onto a 15-20 acre plot on the Stoker site {{consisting of a}} dirt road leading to the airstrip. During the 1960s and 1970s, Stoker released approximately 300 gallons of waste water per day, but the California Regional Water Quality Control Board recently estimated that this was reduced to 100 gallons. The wash water has been determined to be non-hazardous. [...] On May 9, 1988 a pond located at a nearby residence near the site suffered a fish and bird kill. Numerous dead fish (shad and catfish) and ten dead birds (Snowy Egrets) were found {{around the perimeter of}} the pond. Upon necropsy, the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) determined the fish tissue was contaminated by high levels of several different pesticides. The CDFG analyzed the pond and concluded that high winds blew pesticides from the Stoker airplane cleaning activities into the pond. [...] After the discovery of dead birds and fish, the pond was closed to public activities due to the belief of contamination. Later in 1988, an on-site warehouse that contained pesticide supplies caught fire and burned to the ground. The fire started in the east end of the warehouse where sulfur and diatomaceous clays were stored. [...] To avoid health risks, businesses and residences within a 2-mile radius were evacuated. During the fire, approximately 300 tons of soil were contaminated and later disposed of in a landfill regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).|$|E
