50|$|Both albums {{have become}} {{favorites}} among collectors, {{due in part}} to the self-titled first album's risqué cover artwork, which contains a subtle depiction of female genitalia. The cover, designed by Nick Caruso, was banned shortly upon the album's release and an alternative cover was released, making both versions highly sought-after among collectors. The same picture was used, but the artist added a miniature brick wall, topped with razor <b>wire,</b> <b>covering</b> up the vulva in the pie, policemen looking in the windows, and a tear running down the woman's face. The third unreleased album tapes have been discovered by Patterson. Plans are for all three albums to be released on CD.|$|E

50|$|Another type of {{watermark}} {{is called}} the cylinder mould watermark. It is a shaded watermark first used in 1848 that incorporates tonal depth and creates a greyscale image. Instead of using a <b>wire</b> <b>covering</b> for the dandy roll, the shaded watermark is created by areas of relief on the roll's own surface. Once dry, the paper may then be rolled again to produce a watermark of even thickness but with varying density. The resulting watermark is generally much clearer and more detailed than those made by the Dandy Roll process, and as such Cylinder Mould Watermark Paper is the preferred type of watermarked paper for banknotes, passports, motor vehicle titles, and other documents where {{it is an important}} anti-counterfeiting measure.|$|E
40|$|For {{implementation}} in present quantum cryptography and future quantum information sys-tems fast and efficient detectors for single photon counting will be required. For this purpose superconducting single photon detectors (SSPDs) are a promising choice. SSPDs demonstrate high detection efficiency {{in combination with}} low dark counts, a fast response time and very low timing jitter within a broad wavelength range from the UV to the mid-IR (up to 6 μm). Within this master thesis we have fabricated SSPDs from different materials: NbN and NbTiN. The quan-tum efficiency and recovery time of these detectors have been characterized. Furthermore we have investigated the capability of SSPDs to resolve the wavelength of the absorbed photon {{and the number of}} photons which hits the detector simultaneously. Superconducting single photon detectors consist of a nanopatterned 4 nm thick, 100 nm wide meandering <b>wire,</b> <b>covering</b> an area of 10 μm x 10 μm. The wire is current biased and when a photon is absorbed, superconductivity in the wire is locally destroyed. This is described phenomenologi-cally as a ’hotspot ’ of quasiparticles. The supercurrent has to flow around the hotspot and as a consequence the critical current density will be exceeded. A resistive region will appear, followe...|$|E
40|$|The {{scaling up}} of the Hot Wire Chemical Vapor Deposition (HW-CVD) {{technique}} to large deposition area can be done using a catalytic net of equal spaced parallel filaments. The large area deposition limit {{is defined as the}} limit whenever a further increment of the catalytic net area does not affect the properties of the deposited film. This is the case when a dense catalytic net is spread on a surface considerably larger than that of the film substrate. To study this limit, a system able to hold a net of twelve <b>wires</b> <b>covering</b> a surface of about 20 cm x 20 cm was used to deposit amorphous (a-Si:H) and microcrystalline (μc-Si:H) silicon over a substrate of 10 cm x 10 cm placed at a filament-substrate distance ranging from 1 to 2 cm. The uniformity of the film thickness d and optical constants, n(x, λ) and α(x,¯hω), was studied via transmission measurements. The thin film uniformity {{as a function of the}} filament-substrate distance was studied. The experimental thickness profile was compared with the theoretical result obtained solving the diffusion equations. The optimization of the filament-substrate distance allowed obtaining films with inhomogeneities lower than ± 2. 5 % and deposition rates higher than 1 nm/s and 4. 5 nm/s for (μc-Si:H) and (a-Si:H), respectively...|$|R

The bite blocks were connected by a 7 -mm hyrax expansion (Dentaurum, Ispringen, Germany) screw which was bent to allow sufficient palatal clearance for intrusion. The buccal surface of the bite blocks further incorporated two self-ligating brackets (0.022 -in. slot, Speed, Strite Industries, Cambridge, Ontario, Canada) on each side, welded to the internal framework. The brackets were positioned to align with the miniscrews and allow a vertical clearance of 12 mm between the slot on the miniscrew and the slot on the bracket.|$|R

A drift chamber module with 5 anode <b>wires</b> <b>covering</b> an active region of 9 cm x 76 cm has been built to locate the vertical position of a-particle trajectories to within 295 mm full-width-half-maximum (FWEM) in isobutane at a pressure of 0. 25 atm. Modules will be used with the Multipole-Dipole-Multipole Spectrometer in a-particle scattering experiments to measure vertical angles of trajectories needed for ray tracing. The physics of drift chambers is described and used to discuss the operational characteristics of chambers built by other authors and the design of the drift chamber module presented here. Sources of localization uncertainty in the drift chamber module are discussed and the performance of the drift chamber module is predicted based on the physics. Drift chamber modules were tested with 240 MeV a particles using isobutane and an E/P ratio of 2000 V/(cm-atm) at several pressures. The operational characteristics of isobutane were sufficient to obtain high-resolution measurements using the drift chamber module even though up to 6 % more multiwire events occurred in the module than was expected. Trajectories were located to within 225 mm ? 5 / mm (FWHM) at a pressure of 0. 25 atm. The resolution measured experimentally was larger than what was predicted. This suggests that the localization uncertainty due to variations in flight times of ionization electrons was larger than expected and/or the localization uncertainty due to the timing resolution of the electronics was larger than expected...|$|R

The shelves are shallow enough to allow the rings to be within arm's reach, but the workers prefer to hang the jumper on a hook on a pole so their partner can pull it through the ring.

25|$|Wood-burners emit large {{quantities}} of flying sparks which necessitate an efficient spark-arresting device generally housed in the smokestack. Many different types were fitted, the most common early type being the Bonnet stack that incorporated a cone-shaped deflector placed before {{the mouth of the}} chimney pipe, and a <b>wire</b> screen <b>covering</b> the wide stack exit. A more-efficient design was the Radley and Hunter centrifugal stack patented in 1850 (commonly known as the diamond stack), incorporating baffles so oriented as to induce a swirl effect in the chamber that encouraged the embers to burn out and fall to the bottom as ash. In the self-cleaning smokebox the opposite effect was achieved: by allowing the flue gasses to strike a series of deflector plates, angled {{in such a way that}} the blast was not impaired, the larger particles were broken into small pieces that would be ejected with the blast, rather than settle in the bottom of the smokebox to be removed by hand at the end of the run.

40|$|In {{face of the}} new {{upgrades}} for RHIC {{the longitudinal}} impedance of the machine {{plays an important role}} in setting the threshold for instabilities and the efficacy of some systems. In this paper we describe the measurement of the longitudinal impedance of the abort kicker for RHIC as well as computer simulations of the structure. The impedance measurement was done by the S{sub 21 } <b>wire</b> method <b>covering</b> the frequency range from 9 kHz to 2. 5 GHz. We observed a sharp resonance peak around 10 MHz and a broader peak around 20 MHz in both, the real and imaginary part, of the Z/n. These two peaks account for a maximum imaginary longitudinal impedance of j 15 {Omega}, a value an order of magnitude larger than the estimated value of j 0. 2 {Omega}, which indicates that the kicker is one of the main sources of longitudinal impedance in the machine. A computer model was constructed for simulations in the CST MWS program. Results for the magnet input and the also the beam impedance are compared to the measurements.

40|$|The high {{scale of}} {{integration}} of modern equipment used for medical, military and other purposes puts heavy demands {{as regards the}} removal of great heat fluxes. This can be achieved only in exchangers that apply the phase change phenomena. Among many methods to improve boiling heat transfer, the <b>wire</b> mesh <b>covering</b> demonstrates some advantages due to the possibilities of designing the desired microstructure parameters, availability on the market, and low cost. The wire mesh microstucture with specified geometrical parameters produces anisotropy in conductivity. The different arrangement of the mesh layers relative to {{the direction of the}} heat flux is a cause of the change of temperature distribution within the layer. The consequence is a respective change in the discharge conditions of the gas phase and liquid feed. The experiments were conducted on fins covered with a single layer of copper mesh with lumen of 38 % and boiling FC- 72 at ambient pressure. Compared with the smooth surface, the wire mesh structures yield an increase in the heat transfer rate at boiling. It is also shown that nucleate boiling is initiated at lower wall superheat. Formulas for longitudinal and perpendicular thermal conductivity are given for different mesh structure arrangements...|$|R
