40|$|Photograph of T- 38 Supersonic Trainer {{parked outside}} hangar, ca. 1960. At center, a large U. S. Air Force Jet is seen parked on a cement runway. The lightly-colored {{body of the}} plane is long and pointed, {{especially}} near the front. A small black flap is visible under the nose pointing away from the plane's body. The wings seen near {{the back of the}} plane are thin and wide across. The tail, barely visible {{at the end of the}} plane, stands perpendicular to the body with a large number painted at its base. Three tires are visible supporting the jet on the runway. At the top of the jet, two cockpits are visible with their glass coverings left open. In the background, a large metallic hangar is visible.; A description on the back of the photoprint reads: "T- 38 design features [...] This view of USAF Northrop T- 38 supersonic trainer shows 'area rule' curvature at wing junction, <b>wide</b> <b>tread</b> landing gear and separate, jettisonable cockpit canopies for student and instructor.

50|$|The small {{footprint}} {{of the bar}} grip tread makes them perform poorly on sand. Even in the 1930s, 'balloon' tyres with <b>wider</b> <b>treads,</b> smaller tread patterns and lower pressures, were available for desert use.|$|R
50|$|Owing to {{the lower}} air {{resistance}} and better body stance for pushing, road bicycles {{tend to be more}} efficient for use on smooth roads. Cyclo-cross bicycles, which are used for racing on off-road circuits, are closer to racing bikes than to mountain bikes. They have <b>wider,</b> <b>treaded</b> tires and cantilever brakes instead of caliper brakes but are still less efficient than racing bikes at higher speeds.|$|R
5000|$|A larger Q Factor (<b>wider</b> <b>tread)</b> {{will mean}} less {{cornering}} clearance (while pedaling) {{for the same}} bottom bracket height and crank arm length. A smaller Q Factor (narrower tread) is desirable on faired recumbent bicycles because then the fairing can also be narrower, hence smaller and lighter. [...] Sheldon Brown said that a narrower tread is ergonomically superior because it more closely matches the nearly-inline track of human footsteps.|$|R
2500|$|The modern stirrup can be {{made from}} a variety of {{materials}} including metals, wood and certain synthetics. [...] Stirrups with a <b>wider</b> <b>tread</b> tend to be more comfortable and a rider is less likely to become hung up {{in the event of a}} fall. Thinner stirrups provide greater security. [...] Though the underlying design of a flat bottom and curved top have not significantly changed from the earliest artifacts, some modifications have made the stirrup safer and more comfortable.|$|R
50|$|The {{flight deck}} was {{enclosed}} on the A.32 and {{was incorporated into}} the fuselage below and ahead of the high-mounted thick wing. The passenger cabin was under and aft of the wing. The tailskid undercarriage featured a <b>wider</b> <b>tread</b> on the mainwheels, and those wheels were supported by struts running up to the wings undersides. The nose-mounted piston engine was cooled by a radiator, mounted in the airstream on {{the belly of the}} fuselage, under the flight deck.|$|R

50|$|The {{main bar}} frames were {{machined}} from rolled steel slabs and each frame {{was in one}} piece from the front to the hind buffer beam. The wheels were fitted with hollow crank pins, while the leading bogie was fitted with an oil bath centre pivot. The connecting and coupling rods were fitted with floating bronze bushes and were made of special chrome-nickel alloy steel of fluted section. The centre driving set of coupled wheels were flangeless and had <b>wider</b> <b>treads</b> {{than the other two}} sets to prevent them from slipping off the rails in sharp curves.|$|R
50|$|Endurance riders usually use {{a saddle}} that is {{designed}} to be lightweight yet comfortable to horse and rider for long hours of riding. There are saddles designed specifically for endurance riding, though they are not universally used. At the highest levels in FEI, it is usually a variation on the English saddle in shape, although it may have wider panels and stirrups with a <b>wider</b> <b>tread.</b> Lightweight endurance designs based on western saddles are also popular, particularly in AERC rides. Various experimental designs are also common, including treeless and flexible panel saddles. Regardless of design, endurance saddles are very light to ensure the horse does not have to carry unnecessary weight. Many endurance saddles have extra metal rings for the attachment of equipment.|$|R
2500|$|Through a {{door at the}} {{south-west}} {{corner of}} the main hall (now the vestibule) there was a York stone staircase to the roof and road, with [...] deep by [...] high by [...] <b>wide</b> <b>treads</b> and a wrought iron handrail. The terraced roof, which as of 2013 still exists, was intended for promenade concerts with an audience of 700. It runs over to cover the verandah supported by iron columns and ornamental ironwork supplied by MacFarlane & Co of Glasgow in 1904 and still visible today. The bandstand (demolished 1969) had a [...] "roof supported by slender iron pillars and fenced with elaborately designed ironwork." [...] At {{the east and west}} of the building there were Victoria stone drinking fountains (the eastern one was still visible as of 2011). The walls, wood and ironwork were painted with Velure.|$|R
50|$|The Goodyear Polyglas tire was a {{bias-belted}} tire {{first made}} in 1967 by Goodyear. The tire had a <b>wider</b> <b>tread</b> {{than most other}} tires on the market {{at the time and}} used belts made of fiberglass. They initially were an original equipment tire on late 1960s muscle cars such as the Pontiac GTO, Dodge Charger R/T, Ford Mustang Mach I, Chevrolet Camaro Z-28 and many others along with comparable tires from various competitors such as the Firestone Wide-Ovals, Uniroyal´s Tiger Paw and BF Goodrich´s Radial T/A. The Goodyear Polyglas and comparable bias-belted tires began appearing as standard or optional equipment on many 1969-model passenger cars and nearly all 1970 to 1974 models. The most common version of the Polyglas found on muscle cars of that era was the Polyglas GT, {{which was one of the}} first commercially available raised white lettered tires on the market. Other versions of the Polyglas lineup were offered as blackwall or whitewall tires.|$|R
5000|$|The LVRR {{immediately}} {{became the}} trunk line down the Lehigh Valley, with numerous feeder railroads connecting {{and contributing to}} its traffic. The production of the entire Middle Coal Field came to the LVRR over feeders to the Beaver Meadow: the Quakake Railroad, the Catawissa, Williamsport and Erie Railroad, the Hazleton Railroad, the Lehigh Luzerne Railroad, and other smaller lines. At Catasauqua, the Catasauqua and Fogelsville Railroad transported coal, ore, limestone, and iron for furnaces of the Thomas Iron Company, the Lehigh Crane Iron Company, the Lehigh Valley Iron Works, the Carbon Iron Company, and others. At Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, the North Pennsylvania Railroad which was completed during the Summer of 1856, provided a rail connection to Philadelphia and thus brought the LVRR a direct line to Philadelphia. At Phillipsburg, New Jersey, the Belvidere Delaware Railroad connected to Trenton, New Jersey. [...] To accommodate the 4 ft gauge of the Belvidere, the cars were furnished with wheels having <b>wide</b> <b>treads</b> that operated on both roads.|$|R
5000|$|... 1953 was Ford's 50th anniversary. The {{big news}} for 1953 was the {{availability}} of power-assisted brakes and steering, which had previously been limited to the Mercury and Lincoln lines. The center grill bullet lost its ring and was now flanked by vertical black stripes, while the corner markers were plain rectangular lights rather than the circular [...] "intakes". All 1953 Fords featured commemorative steering wheels marking the company's 50th anniversary. Mechanical changes included two-inch <b>wider</b> <b>tread,</b> and a k-bar frame with five cross-members. [...] William Clay Ford paced the Indianapolis 500 in a Sunliner convertible with a dummy Continental tire kit (Coronado kit). [...] This was also {{the last year for}} real wood trim on the Country Squire wagon. Toward the end of the year, Ford added [...] "Master-Guide" [...] power steering as an option on cars with V8s. Full instrumentation was still used. An unusual service provided by Ford was that the radio preset buttons would already be set to local stations by the dealer. The heater was $74.|$|R

500|$|The German {{government}} now publicly predicted the imminent capture of Moscow and convinced foreign correspondents of a pending Soviet collapse. On 13 October, the 3rd Panzer Group penetrated to within [...] of the capital. Martial law was declared in Moscow. Almost {{from the beginning}} of Operation Typhoon, however, the weather worsened. Temperatures fell while there was continued rainfall. This turned the unpaved road network into mud and slowed the German advance on Moscow. Additional snows fell which were followed by more rain, creating a glutinous mud that German tanks had difficulty traversing, whereas the Soviet T-34, with its <b>wider</b> <b>tread,</b> was better suited to negotiate. At the same time, the supply situation for the Germans rapidly deteriorated. On 31 October, the German Army High Command ordered a halt to Operation Typhoon while the armies were reorganized. The pause gave the Soviets, far better supplied, time to consolidate their positions and organize formations of newly activated reservists. In little over a month, the Soviets organized eleven new armies that included 30 divisions of Siberian troops. These had been freed from the Soviet Far East after Soviet intelligence assured Stalin that there was no longer a threat from the Japanese. During October and November 1941, over 1,000 tanks and 1,000 aircraft arrived along with the Siberian forces to assist in defending the city.|$|R
2500|$|Tires vary {{enormously}} {{depending on}} their intended purpose. Road bicycles use tires 18 to 25 millimeters wide, most often completely smooth, or slick, and inflated to high pressure in order to roll fast on smooth surfaces. Off-road tires are usually between [...] <b>wide,</b> and have <b>treads</b> for gripping in muddy conditions or metal studs for ice.|$|R
5000|$|No. 3 {{had been}} unnamed on the Corris, but {{received}} the name Sir Haydn upon arrival on the Talyllyn Railway, after the former {{owner of the}} railway; it seems that at {{that time it was}} not appreciated the crucial role Haydn Jones had played in keeping the Corris line running in the 1930s, which had played an important part in ensuring the locomotive's survival. Along with No. 4, it kept its Corris number, giving both locos the unusual distinction of carrying the same number though the ownership of four different railway companies (the Corris, Great Western, British Railways and Talyllyn Railway). Because both railways were built to the unusual gauge of [...] it was relatively easy to adapt the Corris locomotives to work on the Talyllyn Railway. Sir Haydn became the first new locomotive to travel on the railway for over 90 years. Upon arriving Sir Haydn was the engine in better condition but frequently derailed however and could not be used safely. Upon inspection {{it turned out that the}} Talyllyn track was laid approximately 0.5 in wider than the official gauge, a deliberate policy by the old company to accommodate the long wheelbase of Talyllyn. The two original Talyllyn locomotives had unusually <b>wide</b> wheel <b>treads</b> that allowed them to stay on the wide-of-gauge track. This problem was eventually cured by the fitting of <b>wider</b> wheel <b>treads</b> and by a Territorial Army members' exercise in 1953 relaying the railway to its correct gauge making Sir Haydn usable. The original cab was replaced in the 1960s.|$|R
50|$|The Endurance saddle, {{originally}} {{based on}} a military or police saddle, {{is used for the}} long-distance competition of endurance riding. Its major task is to provide the horse and rider with the comfort and balance needed to cover long distances over rough terrain, sometimes for multiple days. For the rider, the seat is often quilted or padded, and the stirrups are designed with a <b>wide</b> foot <b>tread</b> to reduce fatigue. For the horse, the panels of the saddle are extended to provide a larger area of contact with the back, thus reducing fatigue linked to the pounds per square inch of saddle contact. The saddle has many dee rings along the pommel and cantle that allow the rider to attach various items.|$|R
5000|$|Around 519 BC, {{construction}} of a broad stairway was begun. The stairway was initially planned {{to be the main}} entrance to the terrace [...] above the ground. The dual stairway, known as the Persepolitan Stairway, was built symmetrically on the western side of the Great Wall. The 111 steps measured [...] <b>wide,</b> with <b>treads</b> of 31 cm and rises of 10 cm. Originally, the steps were believed to have been constructed to allow for nobles and royalty to ascend by horseback. New theories, however, suggest that the shallow risers allowed visiting dignitaries to maintain a regal appearance while ascending. The top of the stairways led to a small yard in the north-eastern side of the terrace, opposite the Gate of All Nations.|$|R
50|$|Each {{wing of the}} {{structure}} features continuous open balconies on each floor which serve as single-loaded corridors to the classrooms. The architectural design creates well-ventilated, naturally-lighted classrooms. Stairs that service the five floors are <b>wide</b> with comfortable <b>treads</b> and risers. Structural members are in all honesty defined on both the exterior and interior of the building. There is a grid of discreet sun baffles at {{the west side of}} the entrance hall.|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} spade is a garden spade, which {{typically}} {{has a long}} handle, is <b>wide,</b> and is <b>treaded</b> (has rests for the feet to drive the spade into the ground). An Irish spade {{is similar to a}} common garden spade, with the same general design, although it has a much thinner head. A sharpshooter is a narrow spade. A turfing iron has a short, round head, and is used for cutting and paring off turf. A digging fork, or grape, is forked much like a pitchfork, and is useful for loosening ground and gardening. There can also be toy spades for children.|$|R
2500|$|Many rock-hewn winepresses and vats, {{dating to}} the biblical period, have been found. One typical example at Gibeon has a <b>wide</b> surface for <b>treading</b> the grapes {{and a series of}} {{collecting}} vats. Archaeological finds at Ashkelon and Gibeon indicate large-scale wine production in the 8th and 7th centuries BCE, which most likely developed to supply the Assyrian empire, and then the Babylonians, as well as the local population. Vineyards are mentioned many times in the Bible, including in detailed descriptions of the method for establishing a vineyard (...) and the types of vines (...) [...] The Bible refers to several types of wine and one of the Arad ostraca also mentions wine among the supplies being sent to a garrison of soldiers.|$|R
5000|$|Stirrups are {{supports}} for the rider's feet that hang down {{on either side}} of the saddle. They provide greater stability for the rider but can have safety concerns due to the potential for a rider's feet to get stuck in them. If a rider is thrown from a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of safety precautions are taken. First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth sole. Next, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow a stirrup leather to fall off the saddle if pulled backwards by a falling rider. Other precautions are done with stirrup design itself. Western saddles have <b>wide</b> stirrup <b>treads</b> that make it more difficult for the foot to become trapped. A number of saddle styles incorporate a tapedero, which is covering over the front of the stirrup that keeps the foot from sliding all the way through the stirrup. The English stirrup (or [...] "iron") has several design variations which are either shaped to allow the rider's foot to slip out easily or are closed with a very heavy rubber band. [...] The invention of stirrups was of great historic significance in mounted combat, giving the rider secure foot support while on horseback.|$|R
50|$|Manufacturers produce bicycle tires with a <b>wide</b> {{variety of}} <b>tread</b> {{patterns}} to suit different needs. Among these styles are: slick street tires, street tires with a center ridge and outer tread, fully knobby, front-specific, rear-specific, and snow studded. Some tires can be {{specifically designed for}} use in certain weather (wet or dry) and terrain (hard, soft, muddy, etc.) conditions. Other tire designs attempt to be all-around applicable. Within the same intended application, more expensive tires tend to be lighter and have less rolling resistance. Sticky Rubber tires are now available for use on freeride and downhill bikes. While these tires wear down more quickly, they provide greater traction in all conditions, especially during cornering. Tires and rims are available in either tubed or tubeless designs, with tubeless tires recently (2004) gaining favor for their pinch flat resistance.|$|R
