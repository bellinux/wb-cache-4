40|$|Abstract—In {{order to}} design and build a {{functional}} fraud detection system <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> issues which are often orthogonal to conventional data mining research methodologies consisting of classification, clustering, outlier detection and as-sociation rule mining. The main challenges <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> are low quality data, the lack of training data and good features, and efficient runtime performance. In this paper we report on a pragmatic approach to design a fraud detection system which has been implemented at a major insurance company. The novelty of our approach is the extensive emphasis on integrating domain knowledge through features {{and the use of}} a transparent logistic regression model for both data integration and fraud rating. The use of simple models leads to a more robust and reliable system. It also makes it easier to explain fraud ratings, false positives and other results to the system users and helps build confidence among domain experts, management and the legal department. One major component of our system is the use of record linkage to link identity records over multiple insurance products. This approach provides the biggest source of new and interesting information for fraud detection purposes, as data sharing is frequently overlooked in most situations where data mining is useful.

TEXTURE is a micro-benchmark for query workloads, and considers two central text support issues that previous benchmarks did not: (1) queries with relevance ranking, rather than those that just compute all answers, and (2) a richer mix of text and relational processing, reflecting the trend toward seamless integration.
