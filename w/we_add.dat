In the example we considered above, it's {{easy to see that}} the intersection of all possible models (i.e. the sure information) of the query selecting WHERE Age = 22 is actually empty because, for instance, the (unlifted) query returns no rows for the relation EmpH37. More generally, it was shown by Imielinski and Lipski that Codd tables are a weak representation system if the query language is restricted to projections, selections (and renaming of columns). However, as soon as <b>we</b> <b>add</b> either joins or unions to the query language, even this weak property is lost, as evidenced in the next section.|$|E

25|$|In {{mathematical}} analysis, limit {{superior and}} limit inferior are important tools for studying sequences of real numbers. Since the supremum and infimum of an unbounded set of real numbers may not exist (the reals {{are not a}} complete lattice), it is convenient to consider sequences in the affinely extended real number system: <b>we</b> <b>add</b> {{the positive and negative}} infinities to the real line to give the complete totally ordered set , which is a complete lattice.|$|E
25|$|In {{this case}} {{there are two}} pure-strategy Nash equilibria, when both choose to either drive on the left or on the right. If we admit mixed {{strategies}} (where a pure strategy is chosen at random, subject to some fixed probability), then there are three Nash equilibria for the same case: two we have seen from the pure-strategy form, where the probabilities are (0%,100%) for player one, (0%, 100%) for player two; and (100%, 0%) for player one, (100%, 0%) for player two respectively. <b>We</b> <b>add</b> another where the probabilities for each player is (50%, 50%).|$|E

30|$|We {{randomly}} extracted 1000 {{high quality}} 5 min long {{excerpts from the}} MIMIC data, for which both our method and the QRS detector were 100 % accurate in detecting the segment boundaries. First, <b>we</b> <b>added</b> additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) at different Signal/Noise (SNR) levels to these excerpts and tested both the methods on them. We carried out three sets of tests. In the first set, <b>we</b> <b>added</b> white noise to all m channels, {{and in the second}} set to m − 1 channels. In the third set, <b>we</b> <b>added</b> transient corruption on five randomly selected non-overlapping 1 min long regions. We applied one of the following types of transient corruptions: signal interruption, exponential damping, overshooting and clipping, or superimposition of artificial low frequency signals and high frequency signals.|$|R
25|$|Note: angular {{frequency}} ω (ω=2 π f) with the units of radians per second {{is often used}} in equations because it simplifies the equations, but is normally converted to ordinary frequency (units of Hz or equivalently cycles per second) when stating the frequency of a system. If the mass and stiffness {{of the system is}} known, the formula above can determine the frequency at which the system vibrates once set in motion by an initial disturbance. Every vibrating system has one or more natural frequencies that it vibrates at once disturbed. This simple relation can be used to understand in general what happens to a more complex system once <b>we</b> <b>add</b> mass or stiffness. For example, the above formula explains why, when a car or truck is fully loaded, the suspension feels ″softer″ than unloaded—the mass has increased, reducing the natural frequency of the system.|$|E
500|$|To {{interpret}} this result, observe that as <b>we</b> <b>add</b> mass {{to a white}} dwarf, its radius will decrease, so, by the uncertainty principle, the momentum, and hence the velocity, of its electrons will increase.

As with its predecessors, Ken Sugimori was the art director, although these were the first games in which he did not single-handedly produce all of the art. When asked where his design team came up with the ideas for all of the new Pokémon, Sugimori stated that they got their ideas from past experiences in their childhood involving nature, animals, and the media and then base them on insects. Even looking at the world in a different perspective sometimes provided inspiration for the creatures. [...] "First we select an insect and after that <b>we</b> <b>add</b> essential elements to the insects to make it more like Pokemon, such as adding some hard shape to it, to be more like steel," [...] Sugimori said, describing the process of creating a Pokémon.|$|E
