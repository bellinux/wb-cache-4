50|$|Belgian endive {{is known}} in Dutch as <b>witloof</b> or witlof ("white leaf"), endive or (very rarely) <b>witloof</b> in the United States, indivia in Italy, endivias in Spain, chicory in the UK, as witlof in Australia, endive in France, and chicon in parts of {{northern}} France, in Wallonia and (in French) in Luxembourg. It has a small head of cream-coloured, bitter leaves. It is grown completely underground or indoors {{in the absence of}} sunlight to prevent the leaves from turning green and opening up (etiolation). The plant has to be kept just below the soil surface as it grows, only showing the very tip of the leaves. It is often sold wrapped in blue paper to protect it from light, so to preserve its pale colour and delicate flavour. The smooth, creamy white leaves may be served stuffed, baked, boiled, cut and cooked in a milk sauce, or simply cut raw. The tender leaves are slightly bitter; the whiter the leaf, the less bitter the taste. The harder inner part of the stem {{at the bottom of the}} head can be cut out before cooking to prevent bitterness. Belgium exports chicon/witloof to over 40 different countries. The technique for growing blanched endives was accidentally discovered in the 1850s at the Botanical Garden of Brussels in Saint-Josse-ten-Noode, Belgium. Today France is the largest producer of endive.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Chicory (Cichorium intybus L.) {{belongs to}} Asteraceae family is {{commonly}} known as <b>witloof</b> chicory. The leaves and the roots of this medicinal plant are edible and commonly used as salad. Some varieties are also cultivated as coffee substitute after roasting the roots. All parts of the plant contain these volatile oils, with the majority of the toxic components concentrated in the plant's root. In folk medicine, the plant is used for the treatment of diarrhea, spleen enlargement, fever, and vomiting. Antihepatotoxic activity on damaged rat’s liver sections and anti-bacterial activity of this crop has been recently reported. In vitro regeneration from leaf explants with various hormonal combinations has been reported previously. Moreover, in vitro regeneration of Chicory from cotyledon explants using different combinations of plant growth regulators has been studied. Also, a protocol for the regeneration of plantlets from leaf and petiole explants of <b>witloof</b> chicory has been developed. The aim of the present investigation was optimization of callus induction and shoot regeneration from leaf and petiole tissues of Chicory (Esfahan genotype). Materials and Methods: In this investigation, Esfahan genotype was used for callus induction and direct shoot regeneration. Seeds were first washed with running tap water for 30 min then seeds were surface sterilized by dipping in 70...|$|E
40|$|During forcing of chicory tap roots (Cichorium intybus L. var, foliosum cv. Final) for <b>witloof</b> {{production}} in hydroponics {{a large number}} of thin feeder roots is formed. An inulin pattern of fructans (up to DP 20) accumulated in these roots. The roots were also subjected to osmotic stress by addition of 0. 2 mol/L NaCl or a PEG 6000 solution with the same water potential. Both addition of NaCl or PEG resulted in an increase of internal browning in the heads of <b>witloof</b> chicory, the most important disorder considerably reducing the market value of the chicon. The 0. 2 mol/L NaCl treatment resulted in an important reduction in lateral root and chicon growth; a slightly increased fructan concentration in these feeder roots was also observed. PEG treatment was equally inhibitory on chicon growth, but feeder root growth was nearly not affected. Much lower fructan concentrations were found in these roots but the fructose, glucose and sucrose concentrations were much higher, apparently increasing the osmotic contribution of the stored carbohydrates in the feeder roots. It was demonstrated that this PEG-mediated drought stress effect {{has nothing to do with}} hypoxia. The dynamics of carbohydrates during forcing are discussed based both on the determination of enzymatic activities (invertase, I-SST, 1 -FFT and 1 -FEH) and the composition of the feeder root phloem exudate. status: publishe...|$|E
30|$|Flowering was {{controlled}} by plant genotype, hormone and environmental factors (Cerdán and Chory 2003; Shalit et al. 2009; Song et al. 2013). This study observed that treatment with 28.5  °C significantly accelerated the flowering and senescence of tobacco plants; in contrast, treatment with 18.5  °C greatly delayed the flowering and senescence, as compared with those plants grown under 23.5  °C. Other study also demonstrated that 16  °C delayed the flowering time of Arabidopsis thaliana than those under 23  °C (Blázquez et al. 2003).

40|$|The {{present study}} used 15 simple {{sequence}} repeat loci to characterize the genetic diversity of the germplasm that originated the current industrial chicory and to establish the relationships between and inside Cichorium intybus L. and Cichorium endivia L. Initially we analyzed 19 cultivated C. endivia accessions, 27 wild and 155 cultivated C. intybus accessions distributed among three groups: 83 root chicories, 42 <b>Witloof</b> and 30 leaf chicories. The leaf chicories comprised cultivars corresponding to the Radicchio, Sugarloaf and Catalogne subgroups. The latter has not been previously included in any genetic diversity study. Subsequently, 1297 individuals from the 15 modern root chicory cultivars at {{the origin of the}} breeding of the current industrial root chicory cultivars were analyzed. Although the accessions of C. endivia and C. intybus were clearly separated from each other, seven wild C. intybus individuals were genetically closer to C. endivia than to C. intybus, revealing complex genetic interrelationships between these species. The differentiation of C. intybus into three cultivar groups (<b>Witloof,</b> root chicory and leaf chicory) was confirmed. The leaf chicory individuals were divided into three genetic subgroups, corresponding to the Radicchio, Sugarloaf and Catalogne cultivars, thus attesting to the validity of the classification based on morphological factors. Clear differentiation was ob- served among the Belgian, Polish and Austrian modern industrial root cultivars, but not among the French industrial modern root cultivars. The high phenotypic and genetic variability of the modern industrial root cultivars indicates that this germplasm constitutes a useful gene pool for cultivar improvement and selection...|$|E
40|$|Field {{observations}} in central Belgium indicate a significant soil degradation process which has hitherto not been considered in assessments of soil erosion rates: i. e., soil losses due to root crop harvesting (SLRH). The objectives {{of this study}} were: (1) to assess SLRH for two commonly grown root crops in Belgium, i. e. chicory roots and sugar beet, (2) to investigate some factors controlling the spatial and temporal variation of SLRH, and (3) to evaluate the contribution of this sail degradation process to overall soil loss in the study area. Soil losses due to harvesting of <b>witloof</b> chicory roots were assessed by measuring dirt tare from 43 root samples whereas SLRH for inuline chicory roots and sugar beet were calculated from dirt tare data provided by factories processing these roots. Mean soil loss was 11. 8 ton ha(- 1) harvest(- 1) for <b>witloof</b> chicory roots, 8. 1 ton ha(- 1) harvest(- 1) for inuline chicory roots and 9. 1 ton ha(- 1) harvest(- 1) for sugar beet. Assuming that root crops are grown once in 2 years in the study area, mean annual SLRH equals 5. 0 ton ha(- 1) year(- 1) (0. 33 mm/year). Since these root crops have been grown {{over a period of}} at least 200 years in Belgium, this implies a mean sail profile truncation of 66 mm. However, important spatial and temporal variability in SLRH data was observed, depending on soil texture, soil moisture at harvest time and harvesting technique. Given the importance of SLRH, it needs to be incorporated into future assessments of soil degradation processes and sediment budgets. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|A {{survey of}} lacewings was {{undertaken}} in an agricultural zone of northern France. Adults were investigated in four cultures: strawberry, potato, <b>witloof</b> and kidney bean, and in apple or-chards. A fixed suction trap gave {{an overview of}} the lacewing assemblage present. Yellow trap together with portable suction-device collections showed the hemerobiids and chrysopids currently harboured. Stalked eggs, larvae and cocoons of chrysopids were sampled in straw-berry, potato, cabbage and carrot, and in apple-tree orchards. Rearing in the laboratory of all preimaginal instars of the green lacewings collected bore witness to the actual establishment of any species in the field. Seven green lacewings species were identified, but the lacewing diversity is low. In all cases, the eurytopic generalist predator Chrysoperla kolthoffi was the dominant species. Adults flied from May (wintering generation) to autumn, showing a peak in July. The occurrence of pre-imaginal instars suggests three generations. Four brown lacewing species were recorded, among them Micromus variegatus was the most abundant. They flew mainly in July and August...|$|E
40|$|In {{a related}} study, it was {{established}} {{that the use of}} an ebb-and-flood irrigation method during forcing of the taproots of <b>witloof</b> chicory (Cichorium intybus L) could be used to increase lateral root formation. In this study, five irrigation treatments were used and lateral root formation as well as chicon yield and quality were monitored. Leaf yield was not significantly affected by the irrigation treatments. Standard EU grades were used to develop a parametric chicon quality index (Ql). Taking into account that all conditions except for the irrigation treatments, were controlled and identical for all experimental units, a tendency of an inverse relationship between lateral root formation and chicon quality was found. An aeroponic irrigation system significantly increased lateral root development but produced the lowest QI. Since potential income is dependent on both chicon quality and leaf yield, these parameters were combined and showed that the best potential income was obtained with the ebb-and-flood irrigation method, a promising alternative to be further investigated.

40|$|In young chicory plantlets [Cichorium intybus L. <b>Witloof</b> cv. Flash), nitrate {{assimilation}} {{takes place}} {{mainly in the}} roots. Nitrate reductase activity (NRA) was measured in roots deprived of shoot control by excision and transferred into a sucrose-containing medium. Such a treatment resulted in a drop of about 60 % of NRA within 3 h. The level of NR protein decreased after 12 h {{and the level of}} NR-mRNA after several days. This adaptation of nitrate assimilation to excision was affected by a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation mechanism as shown by increased sensitivity to magnesium of in vitro NRA. Okadaic acid, a serinethreonine protein phosphatases inhibitor, enhanced the decrease of NRA. Conversely, staurosporine, a serine-threonine protein kinases inhibitor, antagonized the inhibition of NRA. This suggests that excision caused a rapid inactivation of NRA in roots of chicory by modifying the phosphorylation balance towards a phosphorylated NR form which could enter an inactive complex.
