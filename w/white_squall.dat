5|$|In December 1997, {{the project}} was called into {{question}} when the projected budget escalated to $108 million due to media and shareholder scrutiny of the studio in financing a big-budget film. Scott rewrote the script {{in an attempt to}} reduce the film's budget by $20 million, but in March 1998, the studio canceled the project due to continued budgetary concerns, and quite possibly to the box office disappointment of Scott's last three films, , <b>White</b> <b>Squall,</b> and G.I. Jane. Likewise, Schwarzenegger's recent films at the time (Eraser and Warner Bros. own Batman & Robin) also underperformed, and the studio's latest experiences with big budget sci-fi movies Sphere and The Postman were negative, as well. In August 1998, director Rob Bowman was attached to the project, with Protosevich hired to write a third all-new draft, far more action-oriented than his previous versions, but the director (who reportedly wished for Nicolas Cage to play the lead) moved on to direct Reign of Fire and the project did not get off the ground.|$|E

25|$|In 1995, Ridley and {{his brother}} Tony formed a {{production}} company, Scott Free Productions, in Los Angeles. All Ridley's subsequent feature films, starting with <b>White</b> <b>Squall</b> and G.I. Jane, have been produced under the Scott Free banner. In 1995 the two brothers purchased a controlling interest in the British film studio Shepperton Studios. In 2001, Shepperton merged with Pinewood Studios to become The Pinewood Studios Group, which is headquartered in Buckinghamshire, England.|$|E

60|$|A look in {{the eyes}} of a shipmate, a low murmur in the most {{sheltered}} spot where the watch on duty are huddled together, a meaning moan {{from one to the other}} with a glance at the windward sky, a sigh of weariness, a gesture of disgust passing into the keeping of the great wind, become part and parcel of the gale. The olive hue of hurricane clouds presents an aspect peculiarly appalling. The inky ragged wrack, flying before a nor'-west wind, makes you dizzy with its headlong speed that depicts the rush of the invisible air. A hard sou'-wester startles you with its close horizon and its low gray sky, as if the world were a dungeon wherein there is no rest for body or soul. And there are black <b>squalls,</b> <b>white</b> <b>squalls,</b> thunder squalls, and unexpected gusts that come without a single sign in the sky; and of each kind no one of them resembles another.|$|R
6000|$|That the Corsair {{is founded}} upon fact is argued {{at some length}} by the author (an [...] "English Gentleman in the Greek Military Service") of the Life, Writings, Opinions, and Times of the R. H. George Gordon Noel Byron, which was {{published}} in 1825. The point of the story (i. 197-201), which need not be repeated at length, is that Byron, on leaving Constantinople and reaching the island of Zea (July, 1810), visited ["strolled about"] the islands of the Archipelago, in company with a Venetian gentleman who had turned buccaneer malgr√© lui, and whose history and adventures, amatory and piratical, prefigured and inspired the [...] "gestes" [...] of Conrad. The tale must be taken for what it is worth; but it is to be remarked that it affords a clue to Byron's mysterious entries in a journal which did not see the light till 1830, five years after the [...] "English Gentleman" [...] published his volumes of gossiping anecdote. It may, too, be noted that, although, in his correspondence of 1810, 1811, {{there is no mention of}} any tour among the [...] "Isles of Greece," [...] in a letter to Moore dated February 2, 1815 (Letters, 1899, iii. 176), Byron recalls [...] "the interesting <b>white</b> <b>squalls</b> and short seas of Archipelago memory." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How can a man {{be filled}} with serious thoughts, Molly, when a sort of Arabian Nights' affair has tumbled on him all of a sudden--took him aback like a <b>white</b> <b>squall,</b> and thrown him on his beam-ends?" ...|$|E

I was sauntering in the sunshine, when {{suddenly}} I found I had to gallop for my life. 'Tis more like a <b>white</b> <b>squall</b> in the Mediterranean than anything else.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Accordingly {{they both}} went forth, {{and took up}} a {{position}} on the coast which commanded a view on all sides. All was radiant again, and comparatively calm. Venetia looked upon the sea, and said, 'Ah! I never shall forget a <b>white</b> <b>squall</b> in the Mediterranean, for all this splendour.' ...|$|E
60|$|In plain prose, Selvagee was one {{of those}} {{officers}} whom the sight of a trim-fitting naval coat had captivated in the days of his youth. He fancied, that if a sea-officer dressed well, and conversed genteelly, he would abundantly uphold the honour of his flag, and immortalise the tailor that made him. On that rock many young gentlemen split. For upon a frigate's quarter-deck, {{it is not enough to}} sport a coat fashioned by a Stultz; it is not enough to be well braced with straps and suspenders; it is not enough to have sweet reminiscences of Lauras and Matildas. It is a right down life of hard wear and tear, and the man who is not, in a good degree, fitted to become a common sailor will never make an officer. Take that to heart, all ye naval aspirants. Thrust your arms up to the elbow in pitch and see how you like it, ere you solicit a warrant. Prepare for <b>white</b> <b>squalls,</b> living gales and typhoons; read accounts of shipwrecks and horrible disasters; peruse the Narratives of Byron and Bligh; familiarise yourselves with the story of the English frigate Alceste and the French frigate Medusa. Though you may go ashore, now and then, at Cadiz and Palermo; for every day so spent among oranges and ladies, you will have whole months of rains and gales.|$|R

'A man cannot go to Jerusalem as {{he would}} to Birmingham, by the next train,' {{continued}} his lordship; 'he must get something to take him; and {{if you make the}} sacrifice of consenting to his departure, {{you have a right to}} stipulate as to the manner in which he should depart. Your son ought to travel with a suite; he ought to make the voyage in his own yacht. Yachts are not to be found like hack cabs, though there are several for sale now; but then they are not of the admeasurement of which you approve for such a voyage and such a sea. People talk very lightly of the Mediterranean, but there are such things as <b>white</b> <b>squalls.</b> Anxious parents, and parents so fond of a son as you are, and a son whose life for so many reasons is so precious, have a right to make it a condition of their consent to his departure, that he should embark in a vessel of considerable tonnage. He will find difficulty in buying one second-hand; if he finds one it will not please him. He will get interested in yacht-building, as he is interested now about Jerusalem: both boyish fancies. He will stay another year in England to build a yacht to take him to the Holy Land; the yacht will be finished this time twelvemonths; and, instead of going to Palestine, he will go to Cowes.' ...|$|R
5000|$|On 12 October 2010, Steve Aoki and Dim Mak Records {{announced}} {{the release of}} Atari Teenage Riot's new single [...] "Activate", with the full-length album Is This Hyperreal? released in 2011.

Consider how the man himself would be elevated: how content he would become, how earnest, how full of all accurate and noble knowledge, how free from envy--knowing creation to be infinite, feeling at once the value of what he did, and yet the nothingness. Consider the advantage to the people; the immeasurably larger interest given to art itself; the easy, pleasurable, and perfect knowledge conveyed by it, in every subject; the far greater number of men who might be healthily and profitably occupied with it as a means of livelihood; the useful direction of myriads of inferior talents, now left fading away in misery.
