The historic term light railway was used because it dated from the British Light Railways Act 1896, although the technology used in the DLR system was {{at the high end}} of <b>what</b> <b>Americans</b> considered to be light rail.

25|$|As {{a result}} of the {{expansion}} of the welfare state and increased regulatory policies by the Roosevelt administration beginning in the 1930s, the term liberalism in the United States today has become associated with modern rather than classical liberalism. In Western Europe, however, the expanded welfare states created after the Second World War were created by socialist or social democratic parties such as the British Labour Party rather than liberal parties. As a result, many liberal parties in Western Europe tend to adhere to classical liberalism, the Free Democratic Party in Germany being one example. The Liberal Democrats in the UK have a classical and a social liberal wing of the party. In many countries liberalism or neoliberalism is used to describe <b>what</b> <b>Americans</b> call fiscal conservatism.|$|E

25|$|While {{wandering}} around New Orleans before a show with Dockstader's Minstrels, he enters a small club {{where a group}} of black jazz musicians are performing. Jolson has a revelation, that the staid repertoire of the minstrel troupe can be transformed by actually playing black music in blackface. He tells Dockstader that he wants to sing what he has just experienced: 'I heard some music tonight, something they call jazz. Some fellows just make it up as they go along. They pick it up out of the air.' After Dockstader refuses to accommodate Jolson's revolutionary concept, the narrative chronicles his climb to stardom as he allegedly injects jazz into his blackface performances … Jolson's success is built on anticipating <b>what</b> <b>Americans</b> really want. Dockstader performs the inevitable function of the guardian of the status quo, whose hidebound commitment to what is about to become obsolete reinforces the audience's sympathy with the forward-looking hero.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a letter}} to the Wall Street Journal, Robert Bell, the President and CEO of University Health Network, Toronto, said that Michael Moore's film Sicko [...] "exaggerated the {{performance}} of the Canadian health system— {{there is no doubt that}} too many patients still stay in our emergency departments waiting for admission to scarce hospital beds." [...] However, [...] "Canadians spend about 55% of <b>what</b> <b>Americans</b> spend on health care and have longer life expectancy and lower infant mortality rates. Many Americans have access to quality healthcare. All Canadians have access to similar care at a considerably lower cost." [...] There is [...] "no question" [...] that the lower cost has come at the cost of [...] "restriction of supply with sub-optimal access to services," [...] said Bell.

2500|$|Gray did not publish his {{geographic}} discoveries on the Columbia River, nor those elsewhere {{along the}} Pacific coast. Captain Vancouver did publish Gray's discoveries in England, {{along with his}} own explorations, and gave Gray credit. At the time, these discoveries by Gray did not gain him any renown nor were thought important. [...] However, the trading opportunities Gray pioneered (in regard to Americans) were soon followed up by other New England merchants, {{with the result that}} the Indians of the Northwest Coast came to call Americans [...] "Boston men". [...] Moreover, Gray's priority in entering of the Columbia was later used by the United States in support of its territorial claims to <b>what</b> <b>Americans</b> called the Oregon Country. The rival British claimants called the more southerly portion of this disputed area the Columbia District, which they derived from the river-name chosen by Gray. [...] Columbia District eventually lent itself to the name of the mid-19th-century colony of British Columbia. [...] When that colony joined Canada in 1871, it became the existing province of British Columbia.|$|E
2500|$|Prior {{to public}} release, Meirelles {{screened}} Blindness to test audiences. He described {{the impact of}} test screenings: [...] "If {{you know how to}} use it, how to ask the right questions, it can be really useful." [...] A test screening of Meirelles' first cut in Toronto resulted in ten percent of the audience, nearly 50 people, walking out of the film early. Meirelles ascribed the problem to a rape scene that takes place partway through the film, and edited the scene to be much shorter in the final cut. Meirelles explained his goal, [...] "When I shot and edited these scenes, I did it in a very technical way, I worried about how to light it and so on, and I lost the sense of their brutality. Some women were really angry with the film, and I thought, 'Wow, maybe I crossed the line.' I went back not to please the audience but so they would stay involved {{until the end of the}} story." [...] He also found that a New York City test screening expressed concern about a victim in the film failing to take revenge. Meirelles believed this concern to reflect <b>what</b> <b>Americans</b> have learned to expect in their cinema.|$|E

2500|$|Kindred ‘s plot is non linear; rather, {{it begins}} {{in the middle of}} its end and {{contains}} several flashbacks that connect events in the present and past. In an interview, Butler acknowledged that she split the ending into a [...] "Prologue" [...] and an [...] "Epilogue" [...] so as to [...] "involve the reader and make him or her ask a lot of questions" [...] that could not be answered {{until the end of the}} story. Missy Dehn Kubitschek sees this framing of Dana’s adventures as Butler’s way to highlight the significance of slavery to <b>what</b> <b>Americans</b> consider their contemporary identity. Because [...] "Prologue" [...] occurs before Dana travels in time and [...] "Epilogue" [...] concludes with a message on the necessity to confront the past, we experience the story as Dana’s understanding of what we have yet to understand ourselves, while the [...] "Epilogue" [...] speaks about the importance of this understanding. Roslyn Nicole Smith proposes that Butler’s framing of the story places Dana literally and figuratively in media res so as to take her out of that in media res; that is, to indicate Dana’s movement from [...] "a historically fragmented Black woman, who defines herself solely on her contemporary experiences" [...] to [...] "a historically integrated identity" [...] who has knowledge of and a connection to her history.|$|E

She was already, he observed to her, thinking what she should say on her other side--which was <b>what</b> <b>Americans</b> were always doing. She needn't in conscience say anything at all; but Americans never knew that, nor ever, poor creatures, yes (she had interposed the [...] "poor creatures!") what not to do. The burdens they took on--the things, positively, they made an affair of! This easy and, after all, friendly jibe at her race was really for her, on her new friend's part, the note of personal recognition so far as she required it; and she gave him a prompt and conscious example of morbid anxiety by insisting that her desire to be, herself, [...] "lovely" [...] all round was justly founded on the lovely way Mrs. Lowder had met her. He was directly interested in that, and it was not till afterwards that she fully knew how much more information about their friend he had taken than given. Here again, for instance, was a pertinent note for her: she had, on the spot, with her first plunge into the obscure depths of a society constituted from far back, encountered the interesting phenomenon of complicated, of possibly sinister motive. However, Maud Manningham (her name, even in her presence, somehow still fed the fancy) had, all the same, been lovely, and one was going to meet her now quite as far on as one had one's self been met. She had been with them at their hotel--they were a pair--before even they had supposed she could have got their letter. Of course indeed they had written in advance, but they had followed that up very fast. She had thus engaged them to dine but two days later, and on the morrow again, without waiting for a return visit, waiting for anything, she had called with her niece. It was as if she really cared for them, and it was magnificent fidelity--fidelity to Mrs. Stringham, her own companion and Mrs. Lowder's former schoolmate, the lady with the charming face and the rather high dress down there at the end.|$|E
6000|$|The Anti-Socialist {{argues that}} out of this evil of {{encouraged}} and stimulated avarice comes good, and that this peculiar meanly greedy type that predominates in the individualist world to-day, the Rockefeller-Harriman type, [...] "creates" [...] great businesses, exploits the possibilities of nature, gives mankind railways, power, commodities. As a matter of fact, a modern intelligent community is quite capable of doing all these things infinitely better for itself, and the beneficent influence of commerce may easily become, and does easily become, {{the basis of a}} cant. Exploitation by private persons is no doubt a necessary condition to economic development in an illiterate community of low intelligence, just as flint implements marked a necessary phase in the social development of mankind; but to-day the avaricious getter, like some obsolescent organ in the body, consumes strength and threatens health. And to-day he is far more mischievous than ever he was before, because of the weakened hold of the old religious organization upon his imagination. For the most part the great fortunes of the modern world have been built up by proceedings either not socially beneficial, or in some cases positively harmful. Consider some of the commoner methods of growing rich. There is first the selling of rubbish for money, exemplified by the great patent medicine fortunes and the fortunes achieved by the debasement of journalism, the sale of prize-competition magazines and the like; next there is forestalling, the making of [...] "corners" [...] in such commodities as corn, nitrates, borax and the like; then there is the capture of <b>what</b> <b>Americans</b> call [...] "franchises," [...] securing at low terms by expedients that usually will not bear examination, the right to run some profitable public service for private profit which would be better done in public hands--the various private enterprises for urban traffic, for example; then there are the various more or less complex financial operations, watering stock, [...] "reconstructing," [...] "shaking out" [...] the ordinary shareholder, which transfer the savings of the common struggling person to the financial magnate. All the activities in this list are more or less anti-social, yet it is by practising them that the great successes of recent years have been achieved. Fortunes of a second rank have no doubt been made by building up manufactures and industries of various types by persons who have known how to buy labour cheap, organize it well and sell its produce dear, but even in these cases the social advantage of the new product is often largely discounted by the labour conditions. It is impossible, indeed, directly one faces current facts, to keep up the argument of the public good achieved by men under the incentive of gain and the necessity of that incentive to progress and economic development.|$|E
6000|$|An acute critic {{tells me}} that Americans reading such deprecatory words as these by an Englishman about his country's {{institutions}} would {{say that this is}} precisely an instance of what an American means by the Oxford manner. Americans whose attitude towards their own country is that of a lover to his lady or a child to its mother, cannot--he says--understand how Englishmen can be critical of their own country, and yet love her. Well, the Englishman's attitude to his country is that of a man to himself, and the way he runs her down is but a part of that special English bone-deep self-consciousness. Englishmen (the writer amongst them) love their country as much as the French love France and the Americans America; but she is {{so much a part of}} them that to speak well of her is like speaking well of themselves, which they have been brought up to regard as [...] "bad form." [...] When Americans hear Englishmen speaking critically of their own country, let them note it for a sign of complete identification with that country rather than of detachment from it. But on the whole it must be admitted that English universities have a broadening influence on the material which comes to them so set and narrow. They do a little to discover for their children that there are many points of view, and much which needs an open mind in this world. They have not precisely a democratic influence, but taken by themselves they would not be inimical to democracy. And when the war is over they will surely be still broader in philosophy and teaching. Heaven forbid that we should see vanish all that is old, and has, as it were, the virginia-creeper, the wistaria bloom of age upon it; there is a beauty in age and a health in tradition, ill dispensed with. What is hateful in age is its lack of understanding and of sympathy; in a word--its intolerance. Let us hope this wind of change may sweep out and sweeten the old places of our country, sweep away the cobwebs and the dust, our narrow ways of thought, our mannikinisms. But those who hate intolerance dare not be intolerant with the foibles of age; we should rather see them as comic, and gently laugh them out. I pretend to no proper knowledge of the American people; but, though amongst them there are doubtless pockets of fierce prejudice, I have on the whole the impression of a wide and tolerant spirit. To that spirit one would appeal when it comes to passing judgment on the educated Briton. He may be self-sufficient, but he has grit; and at bottom grit is <b>what</b> <b>Americans</b> appreciate more than anything. If the motto of the old Oxford college, [...] "Manners makyth man," [...] were true, one would often be sorry for the Briton. But his manners do not make him; they mar him. His goods are all absent from the shop window; he is not a man of the world in the wider meaning of that expression. And there is, of course, a particularly noxious type of travelling Briton, who does his best, unconsciously, to deflower his country wherever he goes. Selfish, coarse-fibred, loud-voiced--the sort which thanks God he is a Briton--I suppose because nobody else will do it for him.|$|E
