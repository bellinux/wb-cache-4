All we care to say is reply to both of these descendants of the original prophet and organizer of the Danite Band is, that when the leading members and officers of the church for many years teach and practice, by threats and murders, ascribed to the Danite Band, then <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> public is justified in denouncing such language and conduct, and affirming it to be the doctrine of the church.|$|E

500|$|When {{considering}} the theological {{meaning of the}} event, some authors have interpreted the darkness as a period of mourning by the cosmos itself at the death of Jesus.
