5|$|The {{video is}} shot in {{black-and-white}} and {{is set in}} a dimly lit and smoky office, where Beyoncé puts on a private show for a detective (played by actor Brett G. Smith). As the clip begins, the detective is gazing out the window. Beyoncé then arrives and stands in an open doorway while rain pours outside. With <b>wavy</b> <b>hair</b> and winged eyeliner, Beyoncé is dressed in a thigh-length leather trench coat and high stockings. After walking inside the office, she immediately strips off her coat. This reveals a satin dress over black panties and thigh-high pantyhose held up by garters. When the music starts, Beyoncé sits on a desk and plays with her hair, her back facing the face of the detective. The latter leans against his desk while watching Beyoncé, who starts to dance sensually on the desk and flips her hair to seduce him. As Beyoncé dances around the armchair, she exposes her vintage-style underwear.|$|E

The forewings {{are covered with}} dark lilacine grey <b>wavy</b> <b>hairs.</b> The apex and outer margin are pale yellow {{and there is a}} large yellow space on the inner margin at the base. The hindwings are lilacine grey, with the outer margin narrowly yellow.|$|R

25|$|He is {{described}} as a dark-skinned man with a lot of <b>wavy</b> <b>hair,</b> a handsome face and a narrow nose. He liked to wear saffron-dyed clothes and musk. He walked swiftly and, when nervous, he would toy with his ring, which was of gold and set with a ruby.|$|E
25|$|Within the {{heathland}} areas, {{the predominant}} community types are Calluna vulgaris (common heather)–Deschampsia flexuosa (<b>wavy</b> <b>hair</b> grass) (H9) and heather–Ulex gallii (western gorse) (H8). Bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) is also widespread, with some patches of bracken (Pteridium aquilinum), and less frequently bell heather (Erica cinerea), cross leaved heath (Erica tetralix) and broom (Cytisus scoparius).|$|E
25|$|He defined nordique {{by a set}} of {{physical}} characteristics: The concurrence of fair, somewhat <b>wavy</b> <b>hair,</b> light eyes, reddish skin, tall stature and a dolichocephalic skull. Of six 'Caucasian' groups Deniker accommodated four into secondary ethnic groups, all of which he considered intermediate to the Nordic: Northwestern, Sub-Nordic, Vistula and Sub-Adriatic, respectively.|$|E
40|$|From November 1996 to March 2000, a {{total of}} 884 {{children}} between 0 and 15 years, from 11 institutions including day care centres, public urban and public rural schools in Uberlândia, State of Minas Gerais, central Brazil, were examined for head louse infestation. Children's sex, race, age and some hairs characteristics were shown to be associated to parasite infestation. A prevalence rate of 35 % was found and the highest rates were observed in black, female children, with long, dark, <b>wavy</b> <b>hairs.</b> Hairs density and thickness {{did not seem to}} influence significantly the distribution of this pediculosis in Uberlândia's schoolchildren. Differences observed between the prevalence rates of head lice in children from the urban institutions suggest there is a greater epidemiological heterogeneity in this group when compared to the rural schoolchildren...|$|R
5000|$|Astragalus bolanderi is a {{perennial}} herb producing erect, drooping, or creeping stems up to 40 centimeters long. The stems are mostly naked, with a sparse coat of long, <b>wavy</b> <b>hairs</b> {{and a few}} leaves on the upper parts.

25|$|Afrocentrists {{hold that}} Africans exhibit {{a range of}} types and {{physical}} characteristics, and that such elements as <b>wavy</b> <b>hair</b> or aquiline facial features {{are part of a}} continuum of African types that do not depend on admixture with Caucasian groups. They cite work by Hiernaux and Hassan that they believe demonstrates that populations could vary based on micro-evolutionary principles (climate adaptation, drift, selection), and that such variations existed in both living and fossil Africans.|$|E
25|$|A forged {{letter by}} Publius Lentulus, the Governor of Judea, to the Roman Senate dates to {{around the year}} 1300 and, {{according}} to most scholars, was composed {{to compensate for the}} lack of any physical description of Jesus in the Bible. Also in the 14th century Nicephorus Callistus quoted an unnamed antique source that described Jesus as tall and beautiful with fair, <b>wavy</b> <b>hair,</b> but his account was most likely without basis and was inspired by the prevailing artistic images of Jesus.|$|E
25|$|Sergeant Webbing—variously {{described}} as being from either B Company or D Company. He somewhat resembles Snorkel, except that he lacks the trademark wrinkles in Snorkel's garrison cap, and has <b>wavy</b> <b>hair</b> and thick eyebrows. He has pointy teeth. On at least two separate occasions, Webbing engaged Sgt. Snorkel in a cussing duel. He also attempted to one-up Snorkel in anthropomorphizing dogs, leading to Otto's first appearance in uniform, and was most recently seen (recognizably, but not mentioned by name) in 1983.|$|E

50|$|Astragalus anxius is a {{perennial}} herb forming a matted patch of slender, delicate stems {{no longer than}} 20 centimeters. It is coated thinly in <b>wavy</b> <b>hairs.</b> The leaves are a few centimeters long and made up of several leaflets. The inflorescence contains 7 to 15 pealike flowers. Each flower is bicolored, the lower petals usually white and the upper banner petals purple to purple-veined white.

25|$|During the 2nd to 1st century BCE in far {{northern}} India, {{in what is}} now southern Afghanistan {{and northern}} Pakistan, sculptures became more explicit, representing episodes of the Buddha's life and teachings. Although India had a long sculptural tradition and a mastery of rich iconography, the Buddha was never represented in human form before this time, but only through some of his symbols. This may be because Gandharan Buddhist sculpture in modern Afghanistan displays Greek and Persian artistic influence. Artistically, the Gandharan school of sculpture is said to have contributed <b>wavy</b> <b>hair,</b> drapery covering both shoulders, shoes and sandals, acanthus leaf decorations, etc.|$|E
25|$|During the mid-1970s, Berkowitz {{started to}} commit violent crimes. He bungled a {{first attempt at}} murder using a knife, then {{switched}} to a handgun and began a lengthy crime spree throughout the New York boroughs of the Bronx, Queens, and Brooklyn. He sought young female victims. He was purportedly most attracted to women with long, dark, <b>wavy</b> <b>hair.</b> All {{but one of the}} crime sites involved two victims; he infamously committed some of his attacks while the women sat with boyfriends in parked cars. He exhibited an enduring enjoyment of his activities, often returning to the scenes of his crimes.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} put a {{priority}} on their schoolwork, ClariS have not released photos of themselves {{to the public and}} employ illustrators to draw their likenesses. When drawn, Clara is depicted wearing pastel pink items, and Alice is shown wearing blue items. Images of the crescent moon are used as a motif to represent Clara, and the sun is used to represent Alice, which comes from their personal preferences. Clara is shown with slightly <b>wavy</b> <b>hair</b> and no bangs, while Alice is drawn with straight hair with bangs. To further preserve their anonymity, Clara and Alice have not told anyone they know (aside from their families) that they debuted as music artists. Both admit that they are otaku, and have taken an interest in anime and anime music. Clara says that she keeps her otaku interests a secret from others at school, and Alice has called herself a Disney otaku.|$|E

25|$|Among the Aztecs, the god Xolotl was {{a monstrous}} dog. During the {{creation}} of the Fifth Sun, Xolotl was hunted by Death and escaped him by transforming himself first into a sprout of maize, then into maguey leaves and finally as a salamander in a pool of water. The third time that Death found Xolotl, he trapped and killed him. Three important foodstuffs were produced from the body of this mythological dog. Mictlantecuhtli, Lord of the Dead, had the bones of man in the underworld, kept over from the previous creations. Xolotl descended to the underworld to steal these bones so that man could be reborn in the new creation of the Fifth Sun. Xolotl managed to recover the bones and brought man to life by piercing his penis and bleeding upon them. Xolotl was seen as an incarnation of the planet Venus as the Evening Star (the Morning Star was his twin brother Quetzalcoatl). Xolotl was the canine companion of the Sun, following its path through both the sky and the underworld. Xolotl's strong connection with the underworld, death and the dead is demonstrated by the symbols he bore. In the Codex Borbonicus Xolotl is pictured with a knife in his mouth, a symbol of death, and has black <b>wavy</b> <b>hair</b> like the hair worn by the gods of death.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to the Homburg, Eden {{was associated with the}} mid-1930s fashion for wearing a white linen waistcoat with a lounge suit, while the poet and novelist Robert Graves likened Eden's moustache to those of film stars Ronald Colman, William Powell and Clark Gable: [...] "the new moustache was small, short and carefully cut, sometimes slightly curved over the lip at either end, sometimes making a thin straight line". When Eden visited New York City in 1938 he was [...] "deluged with fan mail from teenage college girls to elderly matrons", while women reporters and society editors [...] "gushed about his classic features, his long dark eyelashes, his limpid eyes, his clear skin, his <b>wavy</b> <b>hair,</b> his charm and magnetism". In another American city, a display of Homburgs in a shop window was adorned with the sign [...] "Welcome to Anthony Eden". In Amsterdam the hat became known as the [...] "Lord Eden".|$|E
