40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we present}} the design {{principles}} of a mobility architecture for heterogeneous wireless networks support. These principles {{are the basis}} of the architectures implemented by the Daidalos (FP 6) and Rhodos (RNRT) projects. The central concept around which these architectures are built is the design of an Abstraction Layer. The Abstraction Layer offers to the upper layers a common interface for all technologies while hiding the specifics of the underlying <b>wireless</b> <b>technologies.</b> Such a modular design greatly simplifies the implementation of upper layer modules (as they do not need to account for the details of the underlying <b>wireless</b> <b>technologies)</b> and facilitates the inclusion of new <b>wireless</b> <b>technologies</b> into the architecture. The paper describes the design of the Abstraction Layer and its implementation for a number of <b>wireless</b> <b>technologies.</b> Future work directions, including extension of functionality and new <b>wireless</b> <b>technologies,</b> are pointed out.

5|$|When Ra.One {{undergoes}} final tests, Akashi notices unusual glitches but {{chooses to}} ignore them. When {{the game is}} officially launched, it receives a standing ovation from the audience; an enamored Prateek insists on playing it immediately. He logs in under the ID Lucifer and proceeds to the second level, but is interrupted by Akashi. Ra.One, unable to end his turn with Lucifer and angry that a player has proceeded so far, becomes determined that Lucifer will die. He uses a <b>wireless</b> <b>technology</b> (which Jenny had introduced in a conference) to enter the real world, a process which causes the mainframe to malfunction. Akashi informs Shekhar, who partially understands the situation and rushes home, fearing for his son's life. Meanwhile, Ra.One murders Akashi and assumes his appearance; he goes to find Lucifer, and meets Shekhar in the process. In an attempt to save his son, Shekhar claims that he is Lucifer, but his lie is exposed when Ra.One scans his identity card. Consequently, Ra.One kills Shekhar and makes {{it look like a}} car accident.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} use of <b>wireless</b> <b>technologies</b> in {{education}} with particular reference to the potential for m-learning in developing countries. The reports {{of a number of}} current m-learning projects are explored, from which the perceived benefits of using <b>wireless</b> <b>technologies</b> in education, and potential barriers to their use are derived. The use of <b>wireless</b> <b>technologies</b> in education impacts learner motivation, collaboration and mobility, which results in benefits for learners, parents and teachers. Benefits are perceived to outweigh the difficulties encountered when integrating <b>wireless</b> <b>technologies</b> in education. Considerations to be examined include limitations of the devices, pedagogical issues, safety and security concerns, training and support issues, as well as cost considerations. By examining the recommendations from developed countries, <b>wireless</b> <b>technologies</b> can be adopted by the educational sector in developing countries. These recommendations include the establishment of guidelines and principles to ensure the appropriate use of <b>wireless</b> <b>technologies,</b> designing the devices with the end user in mind, and involving all stakeholders concerned. The proposed theoretical model for m-learning adoption in a developing country emphasises the importance of taking a systems view of all the elements that need to be in place in an m-learning environment, including the necessary stakeholders and key elements (communication infrastructure, mobile devices, learners and teachers), in order to ensure the effective adoption of <b>wireless</b> <b>technologies</b> in education. This model embraces the key issues with regard to m-learning as well as the critical success factors that are essential in ensuring successful adoption...|$|R

40|$|Currently, <b>wireless</b> {{communication}} <b>technologies</b> {{are expected}} to be widely employed for in-vehicle communication where in-vehicle communication is built upon the interactions of different parts inside the vehicle. This communication is to enable a variety of applications for driver and passenger needs.   To have improved driving assistance, development of in-vehicle applications is very much needed. At present, intelligent systems inside the vehicle are mostly dominated by the wired technologies. The possibilities of wireless communication have inspired us and made an opportunity to analyse replacements for wired communication within a vehicle. In this connection, the scope of our thesis is to define the in-vehicle applications which are preferred by the <b>wireless</b> <b>technologies,</b> to define the applications using wired technologies which could be replaced by the <b>wireless</b> <b>technologies</b> and to identify those applications which are difficult to implement by the <b>wireless</b> <b>technologies.</b>   In-vehicle wired networks; and problems of these wired networks, along with several existing applications, have been discussed at the initial stage of this thesis for the purpose of having a clear understanding. After that, existing In-vehicle wireless applications and several challenging applications have also been studied. Studies have been done on the most important <b>wireless</b> <b>technologies</b> with their respective specifications. The requirement of establishing wireless communication has also been explained. Finally, an analysis has been done according to the requirements of the applications and verification of their possible reliance on the <b>wireless</b> <b>technologies.</b>   In a brief, comparable studies have been done among the <b>wireless</b> <b>technologies</b> to assess their current and future fitness for In-vehicle applications. The thesis concludes with some recommendations regarding when <b>wireless</b> <b>technologies</b> might be suitable for some in-vehicle applications to replace the wired technologies. ...|$|R

25|$|The National Broadband Network was {{initially}} a fibre {{to the home}} (FTTH) open-access network in planning and trial operation in Australia by the federal government. The national broadband network aimed to provide up to 1000 Mbit/s speeds and to connect to 93% of Australian households and businesses. This has since been revised under a Coalition government to a Mixed-Technology system relying largely on Australia's existing and largely depreciated Copper networks. This revision aims for 25 Mbit/s to 100 Mbit/s, with consumer reports ranging from 1 Mbit/s to 100 Mbit/s. The Australian government had previously called for proposals to build a Fibre to the Node (FTTN) broadband network providing download speeds up to 100 and upload speeds up to 40Megabits per second. The government also utlilises fixed <b>wireless</b> <b>technology</b> and satellite technology to provide fast broadband connection in rural area and very remote area. Fixed wireless provides speeds up to 50/20 Mbit/s. Satellite technology uses sky muster communication satellite which was launched in October 2015 to provide fast broadband in very remote area. It provides speeds up to 25/5 Mbit/s. The network will be the largest single infrastructure investment in Australia's history. In February 2017, the Federal Government of Australia funded the project for the NBN in order to build a mixed technology network.|$|E
