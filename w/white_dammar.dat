5000|$|The {{materials}} {{used to make}} the lamp are box-moulded, wax-moulded, or loam-moulded. These are made in an open space where fire hazards are of the least concern. To facilitate proper moulding, the key component {{materials used}} are: the brown vandal sand exclusively drawn from the Cauvery river bed about 1 km from the Nachiarkoil town used in all types of moulding; [...] "Karuman sand" [...] (used for wax moulding) of pale red colour, available in the town itself; [...] "Savuttu sand", available in light grey colour, used in wax moulding and available in the tank beds {{in the vicinity of the}} town. The admixture used in box-moulding is clay powder in certain proportion depending on the type of moulding used. Other materials used are <b>white</b> <b>dammar,</b> a type of resin drawn from coniferous trees, and castor oil. Cow-dung cakes are the common type of fuel employed to melt the metal before it is poured into the moulds. Parting sand is used to facilitate easy removal of the moulded product. Box-moulding is used extensively as it is a quicker and cheaper mode of manufacture. Nowadays modern machinery is {{used to make the}} lamps.|$|E

The icons from iconostasis usually are not protected by glass and {{they are exposed to}} the burning products of incense. To study the influence of burnt frankincense, myrrh and rosin based incense artificial on {{different types}} of dammar varnishes, samples of balsa wood covered with gesso, titanium <b>white</b> and <b>dammar</b> varnish were exposed to incense and were artificial aged under UV-A light for 60 hours. This paper presents the colour changes suffered by the varnishes...|$|R
