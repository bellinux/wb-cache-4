40|$|Introduction and ObjectivesIn {{the absence}} of right {{ventricular}} hypertrophy or bundle-branch block, a prominent R <b>wave</b> <b>in</b> V 1 or V 2 is considered to reflect a lateral myocardial infarction. We investigated the differences in infarct location and size between patients with prominent R <b>wave</b> <b>in</b> V 1 and those with prominent R <b>wave</b> <b>in</b> V 2. MethodsWe studied 50 patients with a previous first infarction involving left ventricular inferior and/or lateral wall at myocardial scintigraphyResultsA prominent R <b>wave</b> <b>in</b> V 1 was present in 8 patients (16 %), in V 2 in 23 (46 %). At myocardial scintigraphy, the infarction involved the inferior wall in 11 patients (22 %), the lateral wall in 6 (12 %), and both walls in 33 patients (66 %). The sensitivity of a prominent R <b>wave</b> <b>in</b> V 1 in detecting a lateral infarction was low (17. 9 %), while the specificity was high (90. 9 %). The sensitivity and specificity of a prominent R <b>wave</b> <b>in</b> V 2 were 46. 2 % and 54. 5 %, respectively. In patients with a prominent R <b>wave</b> <b>in</b> V 1, infarct size and lateral extent were greater than in patients without this pattern (P<. 005 and <. 0. 01 respectively). In patients with a prominent R <b>wave</b> <b>in</b> V 2, infarct size, lateral extent were not different from patients without this pattern. ConclusionsOnly a prominent R <b>wave</b> <b>in</b> V 1 is a specific sign of large lateral infarction...|$|R

5|$|Cyclogenesis {{describes}} {{the process of}} cyclone formation and intensification. Extratropical cyclones begin as <b>waves</b> <b>in</b> large regions of enhanced mid-latitude temperature contrasts called baroclinic zones. These zones contract and form weather fronts as the cyclonic circulation closes and intensifies. Later in their life cycle, extratropical cyclones occlude as cold air masses undercut the warmer air and become cold core systems. A cyclone's track is guided {{over the course of}} its 2 to 6 day life cycle by the steering flow of the subtropical jet stream.|$|E

40|$|To develop {{improved}} electrocardiographic {{criteria of}} left ventricular hypertrophy, individual electrocardiographic voltage measurements {{were compared with}} echocardiographic left ventricular mass in a “learning series” of 414 subjects. The strongest independent relations with left ventricular mass were exhibited by the S <b>wave</b> <b>in</b> lead V 3, the R <b>wave</b> <b>in</b> lead aVL and the T <b>wave</b> <b>in</b> lead V, (each p < 0. 001), and by age and sex. Better electrocardiographic detection of left ventricular hypertrophy was achieved by new criteria that stratified QRS voltage and repolarization findings in sex and age subsets. For men, at all ages, left ventricular hypertrophy is suggested by QRS voltage alone when the R <b>wave</b> <b>in</b> lead aVL and the S <b>wave</b> <b>in</b> lead V 3 total more than 35 mm. When this voltage exceeds 22 mm, left ventricular hypertrophy is suggested in men under age 40 years when the T <b>wave</b> <b>in</b> lead V 1 is positive (≥ 0 mm), and in men 40 years or older when the T <b>wave</b> <b>in</b> lead V 1 is at least 2 mm. For women, at all ages, left ventricular hypertrophy is suggested when the R <b>wave</b> <b>in</b> lead aVL and the S <b>wave</b> <b>in</b> lead V 3 total more than 25 mm. When this voltage exceeds 12 mm; left ventricular hypertrophy is suggested in women under 40 when the T <b>wave</b> <b>in</b> lead V 1 is positive (≥ 0 mm), and in women over 40 when the T <b>wave</b> <b>in</b> lead V 1 is 2 mm or greater. Of note, the two lead QRS voltage criteria {{for men and women}} differ by 10 mm (1 mV) with identical age stratification and repolarization criteria. Prospective validation of these criteria in an independent "test" series of 129 additional subjects revealed superior sensitivity (49 %), specificity (93 %) and overall accuracy (76 %), compared with standard electrocardiographic criteria (Romhilt-Estes point score and Sokolow-Lyon voltage). A multiple logistic regression equation, developed in the learning series using the same variables, achieved a sensitivity of 51 %, specificity of 90 % and overall accuracy of 76 % in the test series. It is concluded that 1) voltages of the S <b>wave</b> <b>in</b> lead V 3, R <b>wave</b> <b>in</b> lead aVL and T <b>wave</b> <b>in</b> lead V 1 convey the most independent electrocardiographic information about left ventricular hypertrophy; 2) sex and age stratification improves diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy; and 3) criteria based on these observations, as well as a logistic regression equation, readily applicable to electrocardiographic interpretation by widely available microprocessors, can improve recognition of left ventricular hypertrophy by the electrocardiogram...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the eigenfunctions of Rayleigh <b>wave</b> <b>in</b> {{viscoelastic}} halfspace is studied. By {{comparing the}} eigenfunctions of Rayleigh <b>wave</b> <b>in</b> viscoelastic halfspace {{and the corresponding}} elastic halfspace, we found the penetration depth of Rayleigh <b>wave</b> <b>in</b> viscoelastic halfspace is always larger than in the corresponding elastic halfspace. But the difference is small. The ratio of penetration depth and wave length under different cases is calculated, the results show penetration ability of Rayleigh <b>wave</b> <b>in</b> viscoelastic halfspace is always stronger than the corresponding elastic case, and penetration ability of Rayleigh wave gets weaker when the Poisson's ratio is smaller. The penetration ability of Rayleigh wave is stronger when the Q value is smaller. The study in the paper is meaningful for the further research of Rayleigh <b>wave</b> <b>in</b> viscoelastic media...|$|R

In this concept, for a given accuracy in measuring a position one could only obtain a range of probable values for momentum, and vice versa.|$|E

5|$|Interferometry {{makes use}} of the {{principle}} of superposition to combine <b>waves</b> <b>in</b> a way that will cause the result of their combination to have some meaningful property that is diagnostic of the original state of the waves. This works because when two waves with the same frequency combine, the resulting intensity pattern is determined by the phase difference between the two waves—waves that are in phase will undergo constructive interference while waves that are out of phase will undergo destructive interference. Waves which are not completely in phase nor completely out of phase will have an intermediate intensity pattern, which can be used to determine their relative phase difference. Most interferometers use light or some other form of electromagnetic wave.|$|E

5|$|Jupiter is a {{powerful}} source of radio <b>waves</b> <b>in</b> the spectral region stretching from several kilohertz to tens of megahertz. Radio waves with frequencies of less than about 0.3MHz (and thus wavelengths longer than 1km) are called the Jovian kilometric radiation or KOM. Those with frequencies in the interval of 0.3–3MHz (with wavelengths of 100–1000m) are called the hectometric radiation or HOM, while emissions in the range 3–40MHz (with wavelengths of 10–100m) {{are referred to as}} the decametric radiation or DAM. The latter radiation was the first to be observed from Earth, and its approximately 10-hour periodicity helped to identify it as originating from Jupiter. The strongest part of decametric emission, which is related to Io and to the Io–Jupiter current system, is called Io-DAM.|$|E
