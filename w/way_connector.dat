40|$|Objective : The {{bidirectional}} Glenn shunt {{is commonly}} performed under cardiopulmonary bypass for conditions {{that lead to}} a single ventricle repair. We report our experience of bidirectional Glenn shunt done without cardiopulmonary bypass. Methods : Between June 2007 and May 2009, 186 consecutive patients underwent off-pump bidirectional Glenn shunt {{for a variety of}} complex cyanotic congenital heart defects. Age ranged from four months to six years and the median weight was 11. 17 kg (range 4. 3 - 18). After systemic heparinization, the procedure was done by creating a temporary shunt between the innominate vein and the right atrium connected across a three <b>way</b> <b>connector</b> for de-airing. Fifty one patients had bilateral cavae. All cases underwent complete clinical neurological examination. Results : No case required conversion onto cardiopulmonary bypass. Four patients (2. 14 &#x 0025;) died in the immediate postoperative period. The mean internal jugular venous pressure on clamping the decompressed superior vena cava was 24. 69 &# 177; 1. 81 mm Hg. There was no intra-operative hemodynamic instability and oxygen saturation was maintained at more than 70 &#x 0025; throughout. Post Glenn shunt, the saturations improved to mid 80 s. Seventy four cases had documented forward flow across the pulmonary valve. The mean duration of ventilation was 10. 17 &# 177; 8. 96 hours and there were no neurological complications. Six patients (3. 22 &#x 0025;) developed pleural effusions, 4 patients (2. 15 &#x 0025;) had nodal rhythm and 9 patients (4. 83 &#x 0025;) had superficial sternal wound infection. Conclusions : Our results show that off-pump bidirectional Glenn shunt can be done safely in patients not requiring associated intra-cardiac correction. It avoids cardiopulmonary bypass and its related complications, is economical and associated with excellent results. In our opinion, this is the largest series of off-pump bidirectional Glenn shunt in the literature...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Endogenous carbon {{monoxide}} (CO) is produced mainly by heme catabolism. As CO is excreted solely by the lung, a simple technique {{for measuring the}} end tidal {{carbon monoxide}} (ETCO) level was assessed as a method for screening for haemolytic disease in children. Methods: Two end expiratory breath samples were collected from normal children and from children with haemolytic disease using a one <b>way</b> valve <b>connector</b> between a mouth piece and an anaesthetic bag. The samples were analysed by gas chromatography for CO and carbon for dioxide (CO 2). The CO 2 value was used to normalise the CO value to an alveolar concentration. Carboxyhaemoglobin (HbCO) also was measured in the patient group for correlation analysis with ETCO. Results: A total of 21 children with β thalassaemia major, 15 children with other haemolytic diseases (hereditary spherocytosis n= 8, haemoglobin H disease n= 3 and thalassaemia intermedia n= 4) and 23 normal children were studied. The mean ETCO concentrations in the three groups were 3. 21 p. p. m., 7. 41 p. p. m. and 0. 69 p. p. m., respectively, which were significantly {{different from each other}} (P< 0. 0001). There was a significant correlation between ETCO and HbCO in the patient groups (r= 0. 85; P < 0. 0001). Conclusions: The end expiratory breath collection device is a simple and feasible sample collection method. The results confirm that ETCO can be used clinically to distinguish children with a variety of haemolytic disorders from normal subjects. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Connectors {{are used}} in component-based systems as {{first-class}} entities to abstract component interactions. To explain their responsibilities, several taxonomies have been published to date. However, most of them mix different levels of abstraction and fail to provide any guidelines that address different component interconnections through “real connectors ” (employed in assembling real-life applications). In this paper, we propose a <b>way</b> to compose <b>connectors</b> by using fine-grained elements, each of them representing only a single, well-defined functionality. We identify an experimentally proven set of connector elements, which, composed together, model four basic component interconnection types (procedure call, messaging, streaming, blackboard), and allow for connector variants as well (to reflect distribution, security, fault-tolerance, etc.). The presented results {{are based on a}} proof-of-the-concept implementation where connectors are automatically generated (assuming description of connector structure and middleware technologies are provided). Thanks to the element composition approach, such connectors can support more middleware technologies at the same time...|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} home of Actors Theatre {{was an open}} loft—the former Egyptian Tea Room—above the Taylor Trunk Company on Fourth Street in downtown Louisville. In 1965, the theater relocated to the former site of the Illinois Central Railway Station on Seventh Street and River Road. The space was transformed by Architect Jasper Ward into a 350-seat theater. In the fall of 1969, the city announced that the train station was to be demolished to make <b>way</b> for a <b>connector</b> highway. In October 1972, the theater relocated to the newly renovated Old Bank of Louisville building on Main Street, where it remains to this day. The building that became Actors Theatre was a merging of two buildings: the 1837 James H. Dakin-designed Old Bank of Louisville (which is a National Historic Landmark) and the Myers-Thompson Display Building. In 2004 the theater acquired a production studio at 9th and Magnolia Streets in the Old Louisville neighborhood.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates how theatre {{and performance}} artists use new media tools to facilitate political engagement. The chapters cover a {{diverse range of}} performancesfrom interventions in video games to mobile phone walking tours to theatre productions that use social media. In contrast to the dominant narrative of intermedial theatre and performance studies, when analyzing these examples I consider intermediality as a political rather than solely aesthetic mode. By explicitly connecting intermedial approaches to political performanceand acknowledging how these two concepts are already always conjoinedthis dissertation works to expand how we might think about intermediality as a lens that covers digital practices as both form and content. I also consider the value, challenges and dangers of asking spectators to interact with performers and digital tools in order to model new modes of political engagement, and question how various artistic choices impact the ways that audiences are activated through these new technologies. As the examples range in form, content and location, this dissertation traverses numerous intermedial modes and political topicsa multitude of approaches that challenge any singular or simple understanding of how intermediality functions in contemporary theatre and performance. Although there is wariness about overstating the role of new media in creating concrete political change, examples such as the Occupy movement reveal how political discourse is now intricately linked to the digital. In this dissertation, rather than simply reinforcing cyberutopian or cyberpessismistic views regarding the political impact of digital communication, I investigate socio-political contexts and analyze the motivations and receptions of specific projects. I consider a number of questions, including: How are new media performances influenced by the potentially democratizing nature of digital interactions? How do performances integrate with digital media to investigate the <b>ways</b> we <b>connector</b> fail to connectas publics? How does performance also address exclusions related to the digital? Who is the we in the intersubjective relations produced by intermedial performance...|$|R
40|$|Multivalent binding {{proteins}} {{can gain}} biological activities {{beyond what is}} inherent in the individual binders, by bringing together different target molecules, restricting their conformational flexibility or changing their subcellular localization. In this study, we demonstrate a method to build up rigid multivalent and multispecific scaffolds by exploiting the modular nature of a repeat protein scaffold and avoiding flexible linkers. We use DARPins (Designed Ankyrin Repeat Proteins), synthetic binding proteins based on the Ankyrin-repeat protein scaffold, as binding units. Their ease of in vitro selection, high production yield and stability make them ideal specificity-conferring building blocks for the design of more complex constructs. C- and N-terminal DARPin capping repeats were re-designed to be joined by a shared helix in such a <b>way</b> that rigid <b>connector</b> modules are formed. This allows us to join two or more DARPins in predefined geometries without compromising their binding affinities and specificities. Nine connector modules with distinct geometries were designed; for eight of these we were able to confirm the structure by X-ray crystallography, while only one did not crystallize. The bispecific constructs were all able to bind both target proteins simultaneously...|$|R
