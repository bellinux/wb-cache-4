They should be placed initially as lone pairs: one pair of dots for each pair of electrons available. Lone pairs should initially be placed on outer atoms (other than hydrogen) until each outer atom has eight electrons in bonding pairs and lone pairs; extra lone pairs may then be placed on the central atom. <b>When</b> <b>in</b> <b>doubt,</b> lone pairs should be placed on more electronegative atoms first.|$|E
25|$|It is very {{important}} to have a properly formatted, edited, and reviewed medical transcription document. If a medical transcriptionist accidentally typed a wrong medication or the wrong diagnosis, the patient could be at risk if the doctor (or his designee) did not review the document for accuracy. Both the doctor and the medical transcriptionist play an important role to make sure the transcribed dictation is correct and accurate. The doctor should speak slowly and concisely, especially when dictating medications or details of diseases and conditions. The medical transcriptionist must possess hearing acuity, medical knowledge, and good reading comprehension in addition to checking references <b>when</b> <b>in</b> <b>doubt.</b>|$|E

[...] Andrew Barker of Variety called the film [...] "inconsistently acted, and somehow both underwritten and overplotted," [...] {{and while the}} action is [...] "frequent and competently staged," [...] it might feel too repetitive [...] "as yet another witch is ripped apart limb from limb, sending yet another wave of viscera sluicing toward the camera." [...] Similarly, Stephanie Merry of The Washington Post wrote that [...] "after a while it’s easy to become numb to the repulsive sights and bored by action that once seemed intense and exciting" [...] in this [...] "rarely funny spoof that’s heavy on bone-crushing and blood-gushing," [...] giving it one-and-half star out of four. Steven Farber of The Hollywood Reporter also wrote a scathing review, saying that while [...] "Wirkola makes {{the most of the}} 3D technology", [...] "the film is too fanciful to be truly revolting" [...] for its gore effects and [...] "despite its few wry jokes, the script is awfully thin." [...] Roger Moore of The Charlotte Observer gave the film one-and-a-half out of four stars, writing that Wirkola [...] "focuses on the fights and flings all manner of viscera at the 3-D camera as limbs are whacked off and heads and torsos explode. Less attention was paid to the story, and the dialogue is a tad over-reliant on the random f-word to land a laugh." [...] Lou Lumenick of the New York Post gave the film zero out of four stars, writing that [...] "nothing makes a whole lot of sense in this incoherent movie, whose director’s philosophy seems to be: <b>When</b> <b>in</b> <b>doubt,</b> cut somebody’s head off." [...] Kat Murphy of MSN gave it one star out of four, comparing this [...] "big-budget faux fairy tale about skanky witches" [...] to a [...] "downscale video game for dull-eyed teens happy to lap up lame wisecracks and lots of gore." [...] According to Vulture's Bilge Ebiri, [...] "if the similarly situated Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter took itself too seriously, the problem with Hansel & Gretel is that it doesn’t quite take itself seriously enough." [...] Keith Staskiewicz of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a C-, calling it [...] "an intermittently fun, but overexcited and predictable mish-mash." [...] Alicia Malone of IGN rated it a 4.5/10, stating [...] "there are a few funny moments, but overall Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters is too similar to many films we’ve seen before." [...] Calum Marsh of Slant Magazine lambasted the film's [...] "sub-Tim Burton aesthetic" [...] and wrote that [...] "the result suggests A Knight's Tale as penned by Seth MacFarlane," [...] giving it zero out of four stars. Scott A. Gray of Exclaim! praised some elements of the film, such as [...] "lush and colourful art design that recalls a Guillermo Del Toro production, sound creature makeup and special effects, decently choreographed action scenes and a pair of leads who do their damnedest to sell the limp script", giving it a score of 4/10. Chris Knight of The Vancouver Sun called it a [...] "mess of a fairy tale", expecting [...] "a wiccan outcry at the film’s depiction — nay, endorsement — of the torture of witch-folk."

2500|$|Prescriptions, when handwritten, {{are notorious}} for being often {{illegible}}. In the US, illegible handwriting is at least indirectly {{responsible for the deaths}} of 7,000 people annually, according to a July 2006 report from the National Academies of Science's Institute of Medicine (IOM). [...] Historically, physicians used Latin words and abbreviations to convey the entire prescription to the pharmacist. Today, many of the abbreviations are still widely used and must be understood to interpret prescriptions. At other times, even though some of the individual letters are illegible, the position of the legible letters and length of the word is sufficient to distinguish the medication based on the knowledge of the pharmacist. <b>When</b> <b>in</b> <b>doubt,</b> pharmacists call the medical practitioner. Some jurisdictions have legislated legible prescriptions (e.g. Florida). Some have advocated the elimination of handwritten prescriptions altogether and computer printed prescriptions are becoming increasingly common in some places.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{some doctors}} do not review their {{transcribed}} reports for accuracy, {{and the computer}} attaches an electronic signature with the disclaimer that a report is [...] "dictated but not read". This electronic signature is readily acceptable in a legal sense. The transcriptionist is bound to transcribe verbatim (exactly what is said) and make no changes, but has the option to flag any report inconsistencies. On some occasions, the doctors do not speak clearly, or voice files are garbled. Some doctors are, unfortunately, time-challenged and need to dictate their reports quickly (as in ER Reports). In addition, there are many regional or national accents and (mis)pronunciations of words the MT must contend with. It is imperative and {{a large part of}} the job of the Transcriptionist to look up the correct spelling of complex medical terms, medications, obvious dosage or dictation errors, and <b>when</b> <b>in</b> <b>doubt</b> should [...] "flag" [...] a report. A [...] "flag" [...] on a report requires the dictator (or his designee) to fill in a blank on a finished report, which has been returned to him, before it is considered complete. Transcriptionists are never, ever permitted to guess, or 'just put in anything' in a report transcription. Furthermore, medicine is constantly changing. New equipment, new medical devices, and new medications come on the market on a daily basis, and the Medical Transcriptionist needs to be creative and [...] to tenaciously research (quickly) to find these new words. An MT needs to have access to, or keep on memory, an up-to-date library to quickly facilitate the insertion of a correctly spelled device.|$|E

The effect of economic policy uncertainty on firm-level investment is greater for firms with higher firm-level uncertainty and during a recession.
