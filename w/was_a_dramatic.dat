5|$|The {{industrial}} developments, {{while they}} brought work and wealth, were so rapid that housing, town-planning, and provision {{for public health}} did not keep pace with them, {{and for a time}} living conditions in some of the towns and cities were notoriously bad, with overcrowding, high infant mortality, and growing rates of tuberculosis. The companies attracted rural workers, as well as immigrants from Catholic Ireland, by inexpensive company housing that <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>dramatic</b> move upward from the inner-city slums. This paternalistic policy led many owners to support government sponsored housing programs as well as self-help projects among the respectable working class.|$|E

25|$|For Berlioz the {{experience}} of hearing the Eroica brought the last and greatest revelation {{of the power of}} instrumental music as an expressive language, along with the freedom of action with which it could be expressive.
