5|$|To {{identify}} different electrodes, the American Welding Society {{established a}} system that assigns electrodes with a four- or five-digit number. Covered electrodes made of mild or low alloy steel carry the prefix E, followed by their number. The first two or three digits of the number specify the tensile strength of the weld metal, in thousand {{pounds per square inch}} (ksi). The penultimate digit generally identifies the welding positions permissible with the electrode, typically using the values 1 (normally fast-freeze electrodes, implying all position welding) and 2 (normally fast-fill electrodes, implying horizontal welding only). The welding current and type of electrode covering are specified by the last two digits together. <b>When</b> <b>applicable,</b> a suffix is used to denote the alloying element being contributed by the electrode.|$|E

25|$|In {{the pure}} {{fighting}} art of SMR, {{the aim is}} to use the staff defeat an opponent armed with one or two swords. The staff is a flexible weapon and can be used in several ways. A practitioner can use the greater length of the staff to keep the opponent at a distance. It is also used, <b>when</b> <b>applicable,</b> to get very close to the opponent and then to control the opponent's arms or hands. The staff {{can be used in a}} manner that enables the wielder to defeat the opponent without killing him. Common methods include controlling the opponent's hands, wrists, and other targets by using the staff to either strike, thrust or otherwise manipulate the target-areas. <b>When</b> <b>applicable,</b> more lethal strikes are aimed at the opponent's more vital areas such as the head, solar plexus and temples.|$|E

25|$|Pleading (making a claim of) fraud or {{fraudulent}} misrepresentation {{should be}} undertaken with care, {{since it is}} a more serious claim and therefore will be looked at more stringently; if the case is lost or the claim would make no difference to the outcome, then any award in respect of the defending party's costs may be higher {{as a result of}} extra work to defend the claim.

25|$|Data mining can unintentionally be misused, and {{can then}} produce results which {{appear to be}} significant; but which do not {{actually}} predict future behaviour and cannot be reproduced on a new sample of data and bear little use.

25|$|The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) has {{an active}} missionary program. Young men {{between the ages}} of {{eighteen}} and twenty-five are encouraged to prepare themselves to serve a two-year, self-funded, full-time proselytizing mission. Young women who desire to serve as missionaries can serve starting at the age of nineteen, for one and a half years. Retired couples also have the option of serving a mission. Missionaries typically spend two weeks in a Missionary Training Center (or two to three months for those learning a new language) where they study the scriptures, learn new languages <b>when</b> <b>applicable,</b> prepare themselves to teach the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and learn more about the culture and the people among whom they will be living. As of January 2014, the LDS Church has over 80,000 missionaries worldwide and over 10,000 Welfare Services Missionaries.|$|E
25|$|Barotrauma {{of descent}} {{is caused by}} {{pressure}} differences between the increasing ambient pressure and the internal pressure of gas filled spaces of the diver's body and equipment. The skills of equalization are simple but essential to avoid injury. More complex, but also more straightforward in practice, is buoyancy control and the associated control of descent rate. The diver {{is expected to be}} competent to control, and particularly, limit, the descent rate by adjustment of buoyancy of the buoyancy compensator, and <b>when</b> <b>applicable,</b> the dry suit. The diver must be able to limit descent rate to match the ability to equalize, particularly the ears, and to stop the descent quickly without going into an uncontrolled ascent if there is a problem, or when the desired depth has been reached. In most cases the bottom provides a physical limit to descent, but this is not always the case, and it is generally considered bad form to hit the bottom at speed. A skilled diver will stop at the desired distance above the bottom and stay at that depth, neutrally buoyant, and ready to proceed with the dive. These skills require practice, and are not usually fully developed after typical entry level recreational certification.|$|E
25|$|Released on September 12, 2002 in Japan and September 24 in North America, The Document of Metal Gear Solid 2 is an {{interactive}} database for the PS2 that documents {{the development of}} Metal Gear Solid 2. It contains a gallery of all the 3D models of characters, scenery and objects {{that were used in}} the game (as well as unused assets), along with corresponding concept art when available. All the real-time cutscenes (or polygon demos) are also available to view (without audio), with the option to pause them at any point, change the camera angle and move them frame by frame. Other content include storyboards, behind-the-scenes footage, preview trailers, music tracks (with the option to play alternate patterns <b>when</b> <b>applicable),</b> the finalized screenplay, Hideo Kojima's original draft (available in Japanese only), a development timeline, and a gallery of Metal Gear Solid related products and merchandise. The disc also includes a sampler selection of VR training missions that were later featured in Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance. In Europe, the disc was bundled as a bonus with the PS2 version of Substance instead of having a stand-alone release. It was also included in the Japanese 20th Anniversary re-release of Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty on July 2007.|$|E

500|$|Military {{units are}} used for combat against other players. Infantry are the {{cheapest}} unit type and all are land based, using weapons ranging from crossbows to early muskets to more advanced rifles. The heavier artillery classes also make use of ranged weapons, primarily cannon and mortars; however, there is also artillery armed with grenades. Mounted troops are also present, and are armed with either hand weapons, such as swords, or ranged weapons, such as pistols. These units also have significant features, such as skirmishers which do bonus damage against infantry, and ranged cavalry does bonus damage against other cavalry. A new unit introduced in Age of Empires III is the explorer, which is chiefly responsible for scouting and gathering treasure but is also capable of building Trading Posts and has a special attack, used at the player's command. This unit cannot be killed, but can be rendered unconscious, to be revived when friendly units are in range; also, a ransom can be paid to have it reappear at the player's town center. [...] This ransom is credited to the player that disabled him, <b>when</b> <b>applicable.</b> [...] Some shipment cards increase the explorer's effectiveness in gameplay; for example, providing it with [...] "war dogs" [...] can aid scouting and combat.
