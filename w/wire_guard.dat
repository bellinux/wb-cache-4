50|$|Steps {{to prevent}} this buildup of {{deposits}} include only running appliances hot during the initial ignition phase regularly, only building short and hotter fires, regular cleaning of flues using a chimney sweep, and only using internal chimney structures where possible versus a chimney attached to an external wall. The latter tends to be cooler, contributing to the problem, as well as creating downdrafts which tend to introduce smoke into the structure as the fire subsides. The nests of birds can be prevented by using a <b>wire</b> <b>guard</b> over the chimney.|$|E

5000|$|After the Second World War, Slovenia's postwar {{communist}} authorities set up {{a forced}} labor camp for female political prisoners at Podlesje. The prisoners included nuns, minors, and persons accused of having contact with the West. In 1949 about 600 women were imprisoned at the camp under very poor hygiene conditions. Prisoners {{that had previously been}} held at Auschwitz stated that the conditions at Podlesje were even worse. Internees were sentenced to perform [...] "socially useful work" [...] at the concentration camp; the labor involved destroying the local Gottschee German cemetery, breaking rocks into gravel for the roads, and destroying church statuary. The camp was modeled on Nazi concentration camps, with barbed <b>wire,</b> <b>guard</b> towers, and prisoners' barracks. Eventually the camp was closed and the prisoners were transferred to the concentration camp at the castle in Škofja Loka, where they were gradually released. Before they were released, they were forced to sign statements that they would not speak about conditions at the camp.|$|E

5000|$|The GDR {{side of the}} Inner German Border had by far a {{more complex}} system of fortifications and border {{controls}} than the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) which ran 1,381 kilometers (858 mi) long and between 50-200 kilometers deep, the German portion ran from the Baltic Sea to Czechoslovakia with the entire [...] "Iron Curtain" [...] extending from the Arctic to the Black Sea. The border fortifications were indeed formidable with visible electrified fences with barbed <b>wire,</b> <b>guard</b> towers, heavily armed guards, and mine fields.The first area which one would have encountered along the border, traveling from east to west, {{would have been the}} [...] "restrictive zone" [...] (Sperrzone). This section was a 5 kilometer (3.1 mi) wide area running parallel to the border to which access was heavily restricted with permits and checkpoints. On the far side of this zone was the signal fence (Signalzaun), a continuous expanded metal fence 1,185 kilometers (736 mi) long and 2 meters (6.6 ft) high. It was lined with low-voltage electrified strands of barbed wire and when the wire was touched or cut, an alarm was activated to alert nearby guards. Behind this fencing came the heavily guarded [...] "protective strip" [...] (Schutzstreifen). This area, that ran adjacent to the actual GDR border, was monitored by guards in large watchtowers constructed at regular intervals along {{the entire length of the}} border with almost 700 towers built by 1989. These towers made it possible for East German guards to fire upon anyone attempting an escape.With all of these deadly defensive measures in place, it came as no surprise that this [...] "death strip" [...] of land was referred to as [...] "no-man's land." [...] It would be fitting that the former [...] "no-mans land" [...] would become the future [...] "Green Belt." [...] From a nature conservation standpoint, the Iron Curtain was a blessing, a vast strip of land in which wildlife thrived. Freed for 40 years from disturbance hunting and farming, wild animals and plants prospered.|$|E
50|$|With the {{exception}} of the aforementioned white military 750 cc Tiger Trail, the model came in one colour only, 'Sunburst Yellow', and featured yellow plastic mudguards and side panels. The petrol tank of the smaller two gallon 'USA' type in the same colour, had a stylised 'T' decal affixed on either side, the first use of main styling decals for Triumph. The tank had two Italian Paioli petrol taps for main and reserve. The 'semi-western' handlebars, braced and fitted with Dohertey rubber grips, together with the petrol filler cap, two-into-one exhaust system and silencer were black chromed. The tachometer was omitted, its pod being filled with a warning light panel and ignition switch. Braking was by the standard Automotive Products Lockheed 10.25 inch front brake and a newly introduced 7 inch single-leading-shoe rear drum brake. The turn indicators, not featured in the 1981/1982 brochure photo, were black plastic ULO items from Germany who also supplied the rear stoplamp. Also German were the rear view mirrors by Bumm. Rear suspension were Marzocchi 'Euro 74' units from Italy, at 335mm, 22 mm longer than either the standard Girling units or Marzocchi types later fitted to road models. The front suspension was the same as for road models albeit with gaitors fitted as standard and sharing the satin black finish for the range that season. The front wheel rim was 3.00 x 21 inches and like the rear, a 4.00 x 18 inch item, was a chromed item supplied by the Italian firm, Radaelli, both featuring security bolts and both shod with Avon Mudplugger dual purpose tyres. The headlamp was smaller than on the road models in size, its bucket finished in satin black and sporting a separate chromed mesh stone guard. The seat was a 3/4 length item, unique to the model. A black-painted bash plate was fitted to the underside of the frame stopping just short of the sump plate. The silencer was a cut-and-shut version of the standard roadster 'barrel' type. The centre stand was an optional item with only a sidestand originally supplied. Pillion footrests, too, were omitted, the high level silencer precluding passengers. Later production models cured this by fitting a <b>wire</b> <b>guard</b> to the silencer and a footrest extended out to clear the same. No passenger grabrail was ever fitted. Rider footrests were short, black-painted metal items that, unlike the roadster models, were not rubber mounted but could fold back against a spring.|$|E

5000|$|September 1916From: Lieutenant Leefe Robinson, Sutton's Farm.To: The Officer Commanding No. 39 H. D. Squadron.Sir:I {{have the}} honour {{to make the}} {{following}} report on night patrol made by me {{on the night of}} the 2-3 instant. I went up at about 11.08 p.m. {{on the night of the}} second with instructions to patrol between Sutton's Farm and Joyce Green.I climbed to 10,000 feet in fifty-three minutes. I counted what I thought were ten sets of flares - there were a few clouds below me, but on the whole it was a beautifully clear night. I saw nothing until 1.10 a.m., when two searchlights picked up a Zeppelin S.E. of Woolwich. The clouds had collected in this quarter and the searchlights had some difficulty in keeping on the airship.By this time I had managed to climb to 12,000 feet and I made in the direction of the Zeppelin - which was being fired on by a few anti-aircraft guns - hoping to cut it off on its way eastward. I very slowly gained on it for about ten minutes.I judged it to be about 800 feet below me and I sacrificed some speed in order to keep the height. It went behind some clouds, avoiding the searchlight, and I lost sight of it. After fifteen minutes of fruitless search I returned to my patrol.I managed to pick up and distinguish my flares again. At about 1.50 a.m. I noticed a red glow in the N.E. of London. Taking it to be an outbreak of fire, I went in that direction. At 2.05 a Zeppelin was picked up by the searchlights over N.N.E. London (as far as I could judge).Remembering my last failure, I sacrificed height (I was at about 12,900 feet) for speed and nosed down in the direction of the Zeppelin. I saw shells bursting and night tracers flying around it.When I drew closer I noticed that the anti-aircraft aim was too high or too low; also a good many shells burst about 800 feet behind-a few tracers went right over. I could hear the bursts when about 3,000 feet from the Zeppelin.I flew about 800 feet below it from bow to stem and distributed one drum among it (alternate New Brock and Pomeroy). It seemed to have no effect;I therefore moved to one side and gave them another drum along the side - also without effect. I then got behind it and by this time I was very close - 500 feet or less below, and concentrated one drum on one part (underneath rear). I was then at a height of 11,500 feet when attacking the Zeppelin.I had hardly finished the drum before I saw the part fired at, glow. In a few seconds the whole rear part was blazing. When the third drum was fired, there were no searchlights on the Zeppelin, and no anti-aircraft was firing.I quickly got out of the way of the falling, blazing Zeppelin and, being very excited, fired off a few red Very lights and dropped a parachute flare.Having little oil or petrol left, I returned to Sutton's Farm, landing at 2.45 a.m. On landing, I found the Zeppelin gunners had shot away the machine-gun <b>wire</b> <b>guard,</b> the rear part of my centre section, and had pierced the main spar several times.I have the honour to be, sir,Your obedient servant, (Signed) W. Leefe Robinson, Lieutenant No. 39 Squadron, R.F.C.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout the protests, {{a common}} tactic that has divided {{opinions}} among Venezuelans and the anti-government opposition has been erecting burning street barricades, colloquially known as guarimbas. Street barricades, which stop vehicles from passing, violate the 50th article {{of the constitution}} of Venezuela, which grants the right of free transit. Initially, these barricades consisted of piles of trash and cardboard set on fire at night, and were easily removed by Venezuelan security forces. Guarimbas have since evolved into [...] "fortress-like structures" [...] of bricks, mattresses, wooden planks and barbed <b>wire</b> <b>guarded</b> by protestors, who [...] "have to resort to guerrilla-style tactics to get a response from the government of President Nicolas Maduro". [...] However, their use is controversial. Critics claim guarimbas, which are primarily erected in residential areas, victimize local residents and businesses and have little political impact.|$|R

The explosions in the quarry resumed at a minimum distance of 50 meters to the cave and an important employer of the municipality remained. On December 16, 1971, the town council decided to expand the dripstone cave into a show cave. In order to protect it against further damage, first the entrance was walled in and a door installed. This, too, proved unsuccessful as thieves descended from above and broke the door. Only barbed <b>wire</b> <b>guards</b> above and below the entrance and an additional state police patrol service each night succeeded. Geologists and cave explorers traveled to visit the cave. Experts from the Geological Land Office, the Association of German Cave and Karst Researchers and the Nature Conservation Commissioners advised on the expansion of the cave.|$|R
