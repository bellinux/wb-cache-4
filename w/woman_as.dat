40|$|This {{paper is}} based on an ethnographic study of the {{occupational}} culture of a social work team in the UK. It is a discussion of some key aspects of social workers’ construction of <b>women</b> <b>as</b> clients.

50|$|Kowani was {{the central}} {{national}} body that coordinated independent women’s organizations working towards the common goal of improving the lives of women.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 115 - 119). This M. A. {{thesis is}} an attempt to elucidate medieval representations of women by analyzing medieval notions of female sexuality. Giovanni Boccaccio???s the Decameron can help distinguish sexual identities through its representation of sexual behavior. My thesis argues that women were kept in traditional roles but admired because they were unconventional. In Chapter 2, the Decameron is analyzed to demonstrate the facets of Boccaccio???s conventional women: <b>women</b> <b>as</b> possessions, <b>women</b> <b>as</b> meek and controllable, <b>women</b> <b>as</b> na??ve, <b>women</b> engaged in sexual affairs, <b>women</b> <b>as</b> greedy and manipulative, <b>women</b> <b>as</b> lovers of the clergy, <b>women</b> <b>as</b> victims of abuse, and young <b>women</b> <b>as</b> unsatisfied brides. Chapter 3 discusses the four traits that Boccaccio found admirable in women: their willingness to do anything for love, their admirable qualities, their pursuit of passion, and their faithfulness in love. Historical sources analyzed were Boccaccio???s De Mulieribus Claris (Famous Women), Dino Compagni???s the Chronicle of Florence, the letters of Alessandra Strozzi and the religious writings of Angela of Foligno and Saint Catherine of Siena. These sources suggest that men valued women for their beauty and wealth, associated them with nature, considered them meek and submissive, and thought of <b>women</b> <b>as</b> emotional and as causing fights and war. A textual analysis of the Decameron is important because it illuminates medieval constructions of women and describes female sexuality. A comparison of Boccaccio???s conventional and unconventional views of women to those of his contemporaries is significant and necessary in order to rethink the negative tone of much modern scholarship. Approaching the Decameron from a historical perspective helps bridge the gap between literary and historical sources...|$|R
