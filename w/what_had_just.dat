25|$|The {{armies of}} Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Iraq marched into the {{territory}} of <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> ceased to be the British Mandate, thus starting the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. The nascent Israel Defense Forces repulsed the Arab armies, and extended Israel's borders beyond the original Resolution 181(II) boundaries for the proposed Jewish state. By December 1948, Israel controlled most of the portion of Mandate Palestine west of the Jordan River. The remainder of the Mandate {{came to be called}} the West Bank (controlled by Jordan), and the Gaza Strip (controlled by Egypt). Prior to and during this conflict, 711,000 Palestinians Arabs were expelled or fled their homes to become Palestinian refugees. One third went to the West Bank and one third to the Gaza Strip, occupied by Jordan and Egypt respectively, and the rest to Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and other countries.|$|E
25|$|Hart had {{performed}} the stunt {{only a few}} times before. Hart's widow Martha has suggested that, by moving around to get comfortable with both the harness and his cape on, Hart unintentionally triggered an early release. Television viewers did not see the incident. During the fall, a pre-taped vignette was being shown on the pay-per-view broadcast {{as well as on the}} monitors in the darkened arena. Afterward, while Hart was being worked on by medical personnel inside the ring, the live event's broadcast showed only the audience. Meanwhile, WWF television announcer Jim Ross repeatedly told those watching live on pay-per-view that <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> transpired was not a wrestling angle or storyline and that Hart was hurt badly, emphasizing the seriousness of the situation. Hart was transported to Truman Medical Center in Kansas City. While several attempts to revive him were made, he died from his injuries. The cause of death was later revealed to be internal bleeding from blunt force trauma.|$|E
25|$|The state {{legislature}} created State Route 71 in 1931, running south from US-40 (2100 South) along 900 East and through Draper, Corner Canyon, and Alpine to US-50/US-89/US-91 (now solely US-89) in American Fork. However, the portion across the Traverse Mountains between SR-111 (12300 South) in Draper and Alpine was never built, and {{was removed from}} the state highway system in 1935; at the same time, the southern piece from Alpine to American Fork was renumbered SR-74. In 1957, most of SR-71 was moved west two blocks to 700 East, the south end was truncated to 7700 South north of Sandy (replaced by an extension of SR-111), and the north end was extended to SR-181 (South Temple Street). This change was partially reverted in 1959, when the south end was extended back to Draper over <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> become SR-111. In 1969, the north end was cut back four blocks to SR-186 (400 South), and the south end was extended west along what had been SR-111 (created in 1931) to SR-68 (Redwood Road) in Riverton. A short extension west from the south end to the new SR-154 (Bangerter Highway) was made in 2001, pending reconstruction by the state.|$|E

25|$|That day, {{the armies}} of Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Iraq invaded/intervened in <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> ceased to be the British Mandate, marking the {{beginning}} of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. The nascent Israeli Defense Force repulsed the Arab nations from part of the occupied territories, thus extending its borders beyond the original UNSCOP partition. By December 1948, Israel controlled most of the portion of Mandate Palestine west of the Jordan River. The remainder of the Mandate consisted of Jordan, the area that came to be called the West Bank (controlled by Jordan), and the Gaza Strip (controlled by Egypt). Prior to and during this conflict, 713,000 Palestinian Arabs fled their original lands to become Palestinian refugees, in part, due to a promise from Arab leaders that {{they would be able to}} return when the war had been won, and also in part due to attacks on Palestinian villages and towns by Israeli forces and Jewish militant groups. Many Palestinians fled from the areas that are now Israel as a response to massacres of Arab towns by militant Jewish organizations like the Irgun and the Lehi (group) (See Deir Yassin massacre). The War came to an end with the signing of the 1949 Armistice Agreements between Israel and each of its Arab neighbours.|$|E

2500|$|On October 28, Israeli {{journalist}} Ronen Bergman reported Syrian intelligence had {{cooperated with}} the US against al-Qaeda, and that Syria had told the US {{that it would not}} intervene in a US strike. Several days later, The Times also reported that the Syrians had agreed to the raid through a back channel established with the Syrian Air Force Intelligence Directorate. [...] According to the report, after the Syrians gave the U.S. information pertaining to the location of Abu Ghadiya, they agreed to allow the U.S. to apprehend him and take him to Iraq; as such, when Syrian air defenses, on high alert since the Israeli-led Operation Orchard, detected the American helicopters and requested permission to engage them, it was denied. [...] However, the unintended firefight and subsequent deaths made it impossible for the operation to remain covert. [...] One tribal leader told the paper that {{an hour and a half}} after the attack, Syrian intelligence officers came to the area, warning the villagers that if they spoke about <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> occurred, their family members would die.|$|E
2500|$|As {{children}} {{move forward}} with their reading skills, they {{learn a great deal}} about what is really inside a word; the stem, roots, prefixes and suffixes that make up morphemes of the language. [...] By this stage, children already know about the common bound morphemes such as [...] "s" [...] and [...] "ed" [...] because these are attached to many words. [...] Decoding readers become exposed to many types of morphemes such as prefixes and suffixes, and it is when they learn to read these as [...] "sight chunks" [...] that their reading and their understanding will speed up dramatically. Being able to read at a fluent level is not only about how fast a child can read, but {{it is a matter of}} being able to utilize all the special knowledge that they have about a word—its letters, letter patterns, meanings, grammatical functions, roots, and endings—fast enough that they have time to think and comprehend what they are seeing. [...] The point of becoming a proficient reader is to fluently read and comprehend <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> been read. Decoding readers are just beginning to understand and learn how to use their expanding knowledge of language and their growing powers of inference to figure out what they are really reading.|$|E
2500|$|On May 23, 1999, Hart fell to {{his death}} in Kansas City, Missouri during the Over the Edge {{pay-per-view}} event in a stunt that went wrong. WWF broke kayfabe by having television commentator Jim Ross repeatedly told those watching live on pay-per-view that <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> transpired was not a wrestling angle or storyline and that Hart was hurt badly, emphasizing {{the seriousness of the}} situation. While several attempts to revive him were made, he died from his injuries. The cause of death was later revealed to be internal bleeding from blunt force trauma. The WWF management controversially chose to continue the event. Later, Jim Ross announced the death of Hart to the home viewers during the pay-per-view, but not to the crowd in the arena. While the show did go on, it has never been released commercially by WWF Home Video. In 2014, fifteen years after his death, the WWE Network aired the event for the first time. A small photo tribute is shown before the start informing fans that Hart died during the original broadcast. All footage of Hart was edited out of the event. The statement reads: [...] "In Memory of Owen Hart May 7, 1965 – May 23, 1999 who accidentally passed away during this broadcast." [...] Four weeks after the event, the Hart family sued the WWF over how dangerous and poorly planned the stunt was, and that the harness system was defective. After over {{a year and a half}} into the case, a settlement was reached on November 2, 2000, which saw the WWF give the Hart family US$18 million.|$|E
