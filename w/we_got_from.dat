500|$|Anton Chekhov {{was born}} on the feast day of St. Anthony the Great (17 January Old Style) 29 January 1860, the third of six {{surviving}} children, in Taganrog, a port on the Sea of Azov in southern Russia. His father, Pavel Yegorovich Chekhov, {{the son of a}} former serf and his Ukrainian wife, were from the village Vilkhovatka near Kobeliaky (Poltava Region in modern-day Ukraine) and ran a grocery store. A director of the parish choir, devout Orthodox Christian, and physically abusive father, Pavel Chekhov has been seen by some historians as the model for his son's many portraits of hypocrisy. Chekhov's mother, Yevgeniya (Morozova), was an excellent storyteller who entertained the children with tales of her travels with her cloth-merchant father all over Russia. [...] "Our talents <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>from</b> our father," [...] Chekhov remembered, [...] "but our soul from our mother." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN's Eric Goldman {{rated the}} episode 8.5/10. He commented that in {{resetting}} {{the events of}} [...] "Sectionals", it [...] "felt a bit rushed", but concluded: [...] "Glee continues to work because it has its cake and eats it too. It's an over the top, overly cheerful musical – but also a biting comedy that always winks at the audience and acknowledges how cheesy musical theater can be, even while also proving how fun it is." [...] The Daily News David Hinckley shared Goldman's concerns about resetting the characters, and while he believed that doing so was the right long-term move, he commented that: [...] "the immediate effect {{is to make the}} episode feel a little jerky." [...] Hinckley felt that the episode's greatest problems were its pace and execution, observing: [...] "Too many twists and turns feel a little too sudden, leaving us not quite sure how <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>from</b> here to there." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Sectionals" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. TV Guide Natalie Abrams felt it ended {{the beginning of}} the season on a [...] "high note", while Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal commented: [...] "You couldn’t have asked for a better cliffhanger of a fall finale". IGN's Eric Goldman rated the episode 9/10, calling it [...] "very satisfying", and Gerrick Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times commended it as [...] "fine television." [...] James Poniewozik of Time wrote: [...] "I'm not sure I expected or wanted a feel-good ending out of the first half of Glee. But what <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>from</b> [...] "Sectionals" [...] left me feeling very good about where the show is going this spring." [...] In contrast, Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger, felt that the episode brought too many storylines to a head at once, [...] "not allowing all to have as much impact as they might have had the big developments been spaced out". Sepinwall commented, however, that the acting and especially singing performances were [...] "uniformly strong." ...|$|E

2500|$|Experimentation with {{different}} effects pedals {{has led to}} Parker creating new and unique sounds. [...] "If you {{make an effort to}} not put the pedals in the order you're meant to, then you'll end up with something new sounding. We don't have any things that <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>from</b> another planet or anything, it's the same things everyone else has used." [...] "People have a distortion pedal and then a reverb pedal. A reverb is meant to make it sound like it's in a cathedral or something. If you put it the other way around, it won't sound like a guitar being played in a church, it'll sound like a church being stuffed inside a shoebox and then exploded. You can do different things just by treating things differently." ...|$|E

6000|$|She was. And we {{were all}} miserable in company. Aunt Janet {{investigated}} the whole affair and the matter of our dream books was aired in family conclave.

60|$|Our {{plan was}} soon laid. The {{south side of}} Long Island {{trending}} {{a little to the}} north of east, I ordered the ship to be steered east by south, which, with the wind at south-south-west, gave me an opportunity to carry all our studding-sails. The soundings were as regular as the ascent on the roof of a shed, or on that of a graded lawn; and the land in sight less than two leagues distant. In this manner we ran down the coast, with about six knots' way on the ship, as soon as <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>from</b> under the Jersey shore.|$|E

What hurts me, Peg, is the throw-down <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>from</b> my old team and from the students. We're not to blame for rules made by fat-head directors. I was surprised at Dale.

60|$|Forthwith Captain Sam and I {{started out}} to catch soldier-crabs for bait. The {{directions}} <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>from</b> conch fishermen and others {{led us to}} assume {{that it would be}} an easy matter to find crabs. It was not! We had to go poking round mangrove roots until we learned how to catch the soldiers. If this had not been fun for me it would have been hard work. But ever since I was a little tad I have loved to chase things in the water. And upon this occasion it was with great satisfaction that I caught more bait than Captain Sam. Sam is something of a naturalist and he was always spending time over a curious bug or shell or object he found. Eventually we collected a bucketful of soldier-crabs.|$|E
6000|$|Then Mohammed and {{his uncle}} {{picked up the}} girl, and, placing her on the mare's back, led it away, being very careful to walk one on each side, so that she might not slip down and hurt herself. After the Arab tents could be seen no longer, the girl sat up on the saddle and looked about her, and as they were all hungry they tied up the mare, and took out some dates to eat. When they had finished, Mohammed said to his uncle: 'Dear uncle, the maiden shall be your wife; I give her to you. But the money <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>from</b> the sheep and cows we will divide between us. You shall have two-thirds and I will have one. For {{you will have a}} wife, but I never mean to marry. And now, go in peace, for never more will you see me. The bond of bread and salt is at an end between us.' ...|$|E
60|$|The {{hospitality}} of that house! One {{would have}} thought we had arrived, my mother and I, from {{the ends of the}} earth, such was the welcome <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>from</b> Cousin Jenny, Cousin Robert's wife, from Mary and Helen with the flaxen pig-tails, from Willie, whom I recall as permanently without shoes or stockings. Met and embraced by Cousin Jenny at the station and driven to the house in the squeaky surrey, the moment we arrived she and my mother would put on the dressing-sacks I associated with hot weather, and sit sewing all day long in rocking-chairs at the coolest end of the piazza. The women of that day scorned lying down, except at night, and as evening came on they donned starched dresses; I recall in particular one my mother wore, with little vertical stripes of black and white, and a full skirt. And how they talked, {{from the beginning of the}} visit until the end! I have often since wondered where the topics came from.|$|E
