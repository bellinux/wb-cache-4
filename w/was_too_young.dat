5|$|Fincher's {{first choice}} {{for the role of}} Marla Singer was Janeane Garofalo, who objected to the film's sexual content. The filmmakers {{considered}} Courtney Love and Winona Ryder as early candidates. The studio wanted to cast Reese Witherspoon, but Fincher objected that she <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> for the role. He chose to cast Bonham Carter based on her performance in the 1997 film The Wings of the Dove.|$|E

5|$|Middleton {{graduated}} with a bachelor's degree {{in the spring of}} 1909, and was hoping to get an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point. No such opportunity presented itself, however, and at the age of 19 he <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> to take the examination for an army commission. Taking the advice of an army officer back at A, he decided to enlist in the United States Army.|$|E
5|$|Wolfgang was {{qualified}} by {{his skills}} {{at the keyboard}} and violin, and by his compositional experience, for a post as Kapellmeister; but at 17 he <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>young.</b> He therefore remained in Colloredo's employ at the Salzburg court, increasingly discontent, until his dismissal from the Archbishop's retinue during its stay in Vienna, in 1781. Leopold, unpromoted from his rank of vice-Kapellmeister, remained with the court {{until his death in}} 1787.|$|E
5|$|Andrew {{was made}} canon in the Chapter of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Warmia on 16 September 1581. The canons {{and the elderly}} bishop, Marcin Kromer, had been opposed to Andrew's appointment, but the new papal nuncio, Alberto Bolognetti, the {{chancellor}} of Poland, Jan Zamoyski, and Stephen Báthory persuaded one of the canons to abdicate in favor of Andrew. However, the canons, along with the Estates of Royal Prussia, prevented Andrew's promotion to coadjutor bishop saying that he <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>young.</b> At the nuncio's initiative, Andrew was elected provost of the Monastery of Miechów in spring 1583.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the war in 1861, Johnston was fifteen years old and {{attending}} Highland Military College in Newburg, New York. He remained in school through 1862, but then left to raise a company for a regiment being organized in New York. De Peyster's father paid ten-dollar bounties to the men who signed the muster roll of his company. He was not able to assume command because of his age, and his family also felt he <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> for service. However, in the winter of 1863, he threatened to travel to Washington, D.C. and stand for examination for an officership with a colored regiment.|$|E
5|$|Attalus was a {{young child}} when his father died, {{sometime}} before 241BC, after which he was adopted by Eumenes I, the incumbent dynast. Attalus' mother, Antiochis, {{was related to the}} Seleucid royal family (being a granddaughter of Seleucus I Nicator) with her marriage to Attalus' father likely arranged by Philetaerus to solidify his power. This would be consistent with the conjecture that Attalus' father had been Philetaerus' heir designate, but was succeeded by Eumenes, since Attalus I <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> when his father died.|$|E
5|$|Between 1963 and 1965, Jansch {{travelled}} around Europe and beyond, hitch-hiking {{from place}} to place and living on earnings from busking and casual musical performances in bars and cafes. Before leaving Glasgow, he married a 16-year-old girl, Lynda Campbell. It was a marriage of convenience which allowed her to travel with him as she <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> to have her own passport. They split up after a few months and Jansch was eventually repatriated to Britain after catching dysentery in Tangiers.|$|E

5|$|Charles Domery (later {{also known}} as Charles Domerz) was born in Benche, Poland, in around 1778. From the age of 13, Domery had an unusually large appetite. He was one of nine brothers, all of whom Domery said {{suffered}} from the same condition. Domery recalled {{that his father was}} a hearty eater and generally ate his meat half-boiled, but <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> to recall the quantity. The only illness Domery was aware of in the family was an outbreak of smallpox in his youth, which was survived by all the family.|$|E
5|$|Hayes courted {{his future}} wife, Lucy Webb, {{during his time}} there. His mother had {{encouraged}} him {{to get to know}} Lucy years earlier, but Hayes had believed she <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> and focused his attention on other women. Four years later, Hayes began {{to spend more time with}} Lucy. They became engaged in 1851 and married on December 30, 1852, at the house of Lucy's mother. Over the next five years, Lucy gave birth to three sons: Birchard Austin (1853), Webb Cook (1856), and Rutherford Platt (1858). Lucy, a Methodist, was a teetotaler and abolitionist. She influenced her husband's views on those issues, although he never formally joined her church.|$|E
5|$|He {{was given}} to {{sketching}} and drawing from an early age, without encouragement from his family. However, when he turned sixteen and {{wanted to go to}} Stockholm to study art, they were enthusiastic for him and backed him financially. In 1898, {{he was one of the}} 40 applicants to study at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts, and although he was deemed well qualified for a place at the academy, he <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> to be accepted. He spent the next two years at the Kaleb Ahltins school for painters. During this time he was, like most teenagers, torn between hope and despair, something that is reflected in his artwork.|$|E

5|$|In 1938, Waldmann {{applied for}} a career as {{an officer in the}} Luftwaffe for the first time. Travelling to Berlin, he was deemed {{suitable}} but at the age of 16 <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> to volunteer for military service. After the outbreak of World War II, while still at school, Waldmann and his fellow students were forced into compulsory labour service (Reichsarbeitsdienst). Waldmann was assigned to the Brunswick Mechanical Engineering Institute. Since Waldmann had intended to study aircraft construction after his military service, he was reassigned to the Institute of Aeronautical Metrology and Flight Meteorology at the Braunschweig-Waggum airfield under the leadership of Prof. Dr. Heinrich Koppe.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 2012, Hoffman made his final stage appearance, {{starring}} as Willy Loman in a Broadway revival of Death of a Salesman. Directed by Mike Nichols, the production ran for 78 performances and was the highest-grossing show in the Ethel Barrymore Theatre's history. Many critics felt that Hoffman, at 44, <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> {{for the role of}} 62-year-old Loman, and Chris Jones of the Chicago Tribune felt that the character had been interpreted poorly. Hoffman admitted that he found the role difficult, but he nevertheless earned his third Tony Award nomination.|$|E
5|$|Kent {{attended}} St. Philip Catholic Central High School in Battle Creek, Michigan. He {{was recruited}} by the Boston Red Sox as a catcher right out of high school. Kent’s father thought that Kent <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> to play professional baseball and insisted that he go to St. Benedict’s College in Kansas. After graduating, Kent worked at a Veterans Administration Medical Center {{in his hometown of}} Battle Creek while being trained by Leapin’ Larry Chene for a professional wrestling career.|$|E

5|$|Michael Mann was {{contracted}} to direct James Dean in September 1993, and filming {{was scheduled to}} start in May 1994. Johnny Depp and Brad Pitt were under serious consideration for the lead role, while both actors were also attached to the part. Mann approached Leonardo DiCaprio {{for the role of}} James Dean, feeling that DiCaprio was the best candidate. Gary Oldman was also discussed for a supporting role. In March 1994, Mann decided not to direct James Dean due to scheduling conflicts with Heat (1995). Mann also thought that DiCaprio <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> and wanted to wait another year.|$|E
5|$|Murray {{grew up in}} Dunblane and {{attended}} Dunblane Primary School. He and his brother were present during the 1996 Dunblane school massacre, when Thomas Hamilton killed 16 children and a teacher before shooting himself; Murray took cover in a classroom. Murray says he <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> {{to understand what was}} happening and is reluctant to talk about it in interviews, but in his autobiography Hitting Back he states that he attended a youth group run by Hamilton, and that his mother gave Hamilton lifts in her car. Murray later attended Dunblane High School.|$|E
5|$|Shepard {{graduated}} from the Pinkerton Academy in 1940. Because World War II was already raging in Europe, his father wanted him to join the Army. Shepard chose the Navy instead. He easily passed the entrance exam to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis in 1940, but at sixteen <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> to enter that year. The Navy {{sent him to the}} Admiral Farragut Academy, a prep school for the Naval Academy, from which he graduated with the class of 1941. Tests administered at Farragut indicated an IQ of 145, but his grades were mediocre.|$|E
