25|$|Dancers {{at social}} events {{usually have a}} wide range of skill levels, so {{cooperating}} with one's partner matters as much as dancing skill. Dancing with a new partner is a study in flexibility and calibration. What can the new partner do? What are his or her limitations? <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> or she like to do? Dancing with a regular partner is an opportunity to play and practice difficult moves, such as aerials (which are dangerous without regular practice).|$|E

500|$|At one time, Brooklyn Dodgers fans hated O'Malley so {{much for}} moving their beloved team that he was {{routinely}} mentioned along with Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin as the most villainous 20th-century men; one version of a joke went, [...] "If a Brooklyn man finds himself {{in a room with}} Hitler, Stalin, and O'Malley, but has only two bullets, <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> do? Shoot O'Malley twice." [...] Some still consider him among the worst three men of the 20th century. Much of the animosity was not just for moving the team, but robbing Brooklyn of the sense of a cohesive cultural and social identity that a major sports franchise provides. Despite the long-standing animosity of Brooklyn fans and their supporters in baseball, O'Malley was posthumously inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2008 after having been elected by the Veterans Committee with the minimal number of votes necessary for acceptance.|$|E
500|$|As Alfred Gough sees it, Lana is a {{by-product}} of Clark and Lex's decisions. She will always love Clark, and Clark will always love her, but it was Clark's bad decisions, and Lex's [...] "basest instincts" [...] that make Lana the [...] "receptacle {{of all of these}} bad decisions", marking her as a tragic figure on the show. While Lana was with Clark, Kreuk characterizes her as a [...] "wimpy, whiny kind of girl"; with Lex, Lana is [...] "strong, powerful, and doesn't have to question, 'What is going on? <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> think? Does he love me? I don't know where I stand.'" [...] To clarify, Lana's relationship with Lex brings out a darkness that had not been seen in the character. This is evident in [...] "Nemesis" [...] when Lana manipulates her way into seeing Lionel, only to interrogate him about why he forced her to marry Lex, as well as leaving Lex to die in the underground tunnels. As Gough explains, {{by the end of the}} sixth season, Lana has shown that she can beat Lex at his own games.|$|E
500|$|In 1998, {{the project}} {{was taken over by}} Franchise Pictures, a {{recently}} established company whose head, Elie Samaha, a former dry cleaning mogul turned nightclub owner, specialized in rescuing stars' pet projects. Franchise sought out stars whose projects were stalled at the major studios, bringing them aboard at reduced salaries. Samaha's approach made waves in Hollywood, earning him a reputation of being able to produce star vehicles more cheaply than the larger studios. His unorthodox deals raised eyebrows and the entertainment industry magazine Variety commented that they were [...] "often so complex and variable as to leave outsiders scratching their heads". As Samaha put it, [...] "I said, 'If John wants to make this movie, <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> want to get paid?' … Because I do not pay anybody what they make. That is not my business plan.'" [...] He learned of Battlefield Earth from Cassian Elwes, an agent at the theatrical agency William Morris, and approached Travolta. A deal was soon struck and financing was arranged; Travolta significantly reduced his normal fee of $20million, lowering the film's cost from the $100million that had previously been forecast, and costs were reduced further by using Canadian locations and facilities.|$|E

With <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> feed them? I should think the crowd there is large." [...] High responds that this is indeed true, that a huge amount are already in Valhalla, but yet this amount will seem to be too few when [...] "the wolf comes." [...] High describes that there are never too many to feed in Valhalla, for they feast from Sæhrímnir (here described as a boar), and that this beast is cooked every day and is again whole every night. Grímnismál stanza 18 is then recounted. Gangleri asks if Odin himself eats the same food as the Einherjar, and High responds that Odin needs nothing to eat—Odin only consumes wine—and he gives his food to his wolves Geri and Freki. Grímnismál stanza 19 is then recounted. High additionally states that at sunrise, Odin sends his ravens Huginn and Muninn from Valhalla to fly throughout the entire world, and they return in time for the first meal there.|$|E
500|$|Peng made regular {{inspection}} {{tours of}} the Chinese provinces after becoming Defense Minister in 1953. In a tour on Guangzhou in April 1958, he openly criticized Mao, saying [...] "The Chairman talks {{all the time about}} more, faster, better, and more economical results. That is annoying. <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> want with chanting these liturgies all the time?" [...] On an inspection tour through Gansu in October 1958, Peng observed many of the problems associated with the Great Leap Forward. Mature crops were left to die in the field because all of the young men had been drafted to operate primitive backyard furnaces. When Peng asked an old peasant why no one was collecting the harvest, he received the answer: [...] "unless the centre sends down a great comrade, one cannot stand up against this storm." [...] On the same tour Peng heard complaints that household utensils were being melted down for [...] "steel", and that houses and orchards were cut and torn down in order to provide fuel for the backyard furnaces. In a subsequent tour through his native province of Hunan, later in 1958, Peng observed the same problems associated everywhere with the Great Leap Forward: serious food shortages; hungry children and babies; elders who expressed bitterness and anger; and arrogant, boasting Party cadres who administered local economic reforms. During his inspection tours through China in the fall of 1958, Peng composed a poem that summarized his attitude towards the Great Leap Forward: ...|$|E

2500|$|On 23 July, British Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey made a {{mediation}} offer with {{a promise}} that his government would attempt to influence Russia to influence Serbia, and Germany to influence Austria-Hungary {{as the best way}} of stopping a general war. Wilhelm wrote on the margins of Lichnowsky's dispatch containing Grey’s offer that Britain’s [...] "condescending orders" [...] were to be totally rejected, and Austria-Hungary would not retract any of its [...] "impossible demands" [...] on Serbia. He continued: [...] "Am I to do that? Wouldn’t think of it! <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> [...] mean by ‘impossible’?" [...] Jagow ordered Lichnowsky to tell Grey of the supposed German ignorance of the Austrian ultimatum, and that Germany regarded Austro-Serbian relations as [...] "an internal affair of Austria-Hungary, in which we had no standing to intervene". Jagow's statement did much to discredit Germany in British eyes. Lichnowsky reported to Berlin [...] "If we do not join the mediation, all faith here in us and in our love of peace will be shattered." ...|$|E

In some ways Bertie's lack of vision was a positive, it made him flexible and willing to compromise, and he was certainly outstanding in that regard. But I dissent from the universal plaudits going around at the moment. He had no social or economic vision for the state he led. There was no fire in his belly. He didn't really want to change society for the better. He was the ward boss writ large. But at the moment it seems it's unfashionable to say anything adverse about Bertie." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{a hunting}} expedition, Osburgo and Valdeburgo {{encounter}} Arturo, but {{are aware that}} Alaide's cabin is close by. [...] Osburgo begs him to return for his wedding to Isoletta, but he refuses, declaring {{that he does not}} love her. He asks Valdeburgo to meet his true love, after which he promises that he will never see her again if Valdeburgo judges her unworthy. The pair approach the cabin, from which Alaide emerges. Upon seeing her, Valdeburgo hails her and almost calls out her real name, but Alaide stops him. Valdeburgo tells Arturo that —for reasons he cannot reveal— Arturo must renounce any intentions toward Alaide. She cannot ever marry Arturo. Thinking Valdeburgo is his rival for Alaide's affections, Arturo is about to attack him with his sword, but he declares that he is not a rival. (Trio: first Valdeburgo No: non ti son rivale; / non io ti tolgo a lei / [...] "No: I am not your rival; then Arturo [...] "Ah, if he is not my rival, / <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> wish of me"; then Alaide [...] "No, you have no rival".)

2500|$|The {{audience}} {{disagreed with}} Carruthers. They expressed {{that the show}} made a [...] "ludicrous decision" [...] to keep Babe over Dixie. On February 18, 2007, {{it was reported that}} Cady McClain, Dixie's portrayer, had spoken out about what happened via her blog [...] {{to set the record straight}} and to ease the nerves of fans. Viewers had often voiced that Dixie was killed off because McClain was very out-spoken about matters she disagreed with in regards to the soap opera and executives. In December 2006, McClain learned that Dixie would be one of the Satin Slayer's victims. It was not until several weeks later, however, that the news of McClain's exit leaked to the media. Viewers speculated that her dismissal was due to her outspokenness about the exit of Emmy-winning actress Julia Barr (ex-Brooke English). Seemingly adding credibility to the rumor was a report from Fox News Channel stating that McClain's outspokenness led to ABC executives firing McClain. McClain responded on her blog: [...] "Who is this guy from Fox news and <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> know?" [...] She stated that her blog entries were always approved by ABC executives before they were posted to the Internet. [...] "I was talking about the character of Brooke when I said 'life is not fair,' [...] not Julia getting let go." ...|$|E
