In 1970 Paramount offered to sell all rights to Star Trek to Roddenberry, but he could not afford the $150,000 ($ in 2007) price.|$|E

At one point he was offered US $100,000 (today roughly $5,000,000) for his slaves, but he declined the offer, worried that their new owner might mistreat them.|$|E
25|$|Bonds are {{bought and}} traded mostly by {{institutions}} like central banks, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, insurance companies, hedge funds, and banks. Insurance companies and pension funds have liabilities which essentially include fixed amounts payable on predetermined dates. They buy the bonds {{to match their}} liabilities, and may be compelled by law to do this. Most individuals who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>own</b> bonds do so through bond funds. Still, in the U.S., nearly 10% of all bonds outstanding are held directly by households.|$|E

500|$|Rice {{initially}} {{expressed an}} adamant stance against fan fiction {{based on her}} works, and particularly in opposition to such fiction based on The Vampire Chronicles, releasing a statement on April 7, 2000, that disallowed all such efforts, citing copyright issues.

500|$|Marketing for {{the film}} {{included}} $20million spent by Disney for advertising as well as advertisers such as Burger King, PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, and Payless ShoeSource paying $125million in tied promotions {{for the film}}. Marketing consultant Al Ries reflected on the promotion: [...] "This will be a killer deal. How can a kid, sitting through a one-and-a-half-hour movie with an army of recognizable toy characters, not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>own</b> one?" [...] Despite this, Disney Consumer Products was slow to see the potential of Toy Story early on. When the Thanksgiving release date was announced in January 1995, many toy companies were accustomed to having eighteen months to two years of runway time and passed on the project. In February 1995, Disney took the idea to Toy Fair, a toy industry trade show in New York. There, a Toronto-based company with a factory based in China, Thinkway Toys, became interested. Although Thinkway was a small player in the industry, mainly producing toy banks {{in the form of}} film characters, it was able to scoop up the worldwide master license for Toy Story toys simply because no one else wanted it. Walt Disney Home Video put a trailer for the film on seven million copies of the VHS re-release of Cinderella; the Disney Channel ran a television special on the making of Toy Story; Walt Disney World in Florida held a daily Toy Story parade at Disney-MGM Studios.|$|E

2500|$|The {{history of}} {{suburbia}} {{is part of}} the study of urban history, which focuses on the origins, growth, diverse typologies, culture, and politics of suburbs, {{as well as on the}} gendered and family-oriented nature of suburban space. Many people have assumed that early-20th-century suburbs were enclaves for middle-class whites, a concept that carries tremendous cultural influence yet is actually stereotypical. Many suburbs are based on a heterogeneous society of working-class and minority residents, many of whom <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>own</b> their own house. Mary Corbin Sies argues that it is necessary to examine how [...] "suburb" [...] is defined as well as the distinction made between cities and suburbs, geography, economic circumstances, and the interaction of numerous factors that move research beyond acceptance of stereotyping and its influence on scholarly assumptions.|$|E

2500|$|Developed by Parroty Interactive, the self-professed National Lampoon of the {{interactive}} media industry, Microshaft Winblows 98 became the company's fourth interactive comedy video game, after Pyst, Star Warped, and The X-Fools, which parodied adventure video game Myst, science fiction film series Star Wars, and supernatural television series The X Files, respectively. Ed Bernstein, founder and CEO of Palladium Interactive had long-wanted to create works that emulated the parody found in Mad Magazine, and felt this game {{could be his}} [...] "piece de resistance", further commenting that his company {{would have been able}} to [...] "sell the empty boxes" [...] due to the game cover humour alone. Elizabeth Wasserman of Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News cited various examples of this including the tagline [...] "Who does he <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>own</b> today?", a parody of Microsoft's own [...] "Where do you want to go to today?", and the version, listed as [...] "98 or 99 or 00 or 01". The game was written by Tony Camin, Ian Deitchman, J. P. Manoux and Kristin Rusk.
