40|$|ABSTRACT: A flowing {{concrete}} and two self-compacting concretes were manufactured, at given portland cement content (400 kg/m 3) and water-cement ratio (0. 45), {{in order to}} obtain the same 28 -day cube strength. Two mineral additions were used in producing SCC (ground limestone or fly ash). The dosage of a polycarboxylate-based superplasticizer was adapted to produce SCCs with a slump-flow of about 750 mm and a {{flowing concrete}} with a slump of 200 mm. Concrete specimens were <b>wet</b> <b>cured</b> at room temperature (20 °C). The compressive strength of SCCs were higher than that of the flowing concrete. This {{can be explained by the}} pozzolanic activity of fly ash in addition to the cement content; however, ground limestone is not a pozzolanic material and then its acton can be related with a change in the microstructure of the cement matrix caused by the small particles of limestone. The change in the microstructure can also explain why the steel-bond strength is much higher in the two SCCs than in the flowing concrete. The drying shrinkage of the SCCs is substantially the same of that of ordinary flowing concrete, whereas creep is slightly higher in fly-ash SCC than in limestone-SCC or flowing concrete...|$|E

40|$|In modern {{construction}} projects {{it is necessary}} to work with concrete at a time before its strength can be fully developed. Applying large construction loads to a structure can lead to a reduction in strength if the serviceability limit has been exceeded.

This phenomenon of increased strength after loading and subsequent curing has been reported in the literature for many years, but the use of modern compressive test apparatus has enabled the present authors to show that the final strength has a high level of correlation with the displacement during the initial early loading.

In Microlab TU Delft, the concept has been enhanced by developing a liquid bacteria-based concrete repair system. The solution contains calcite precipitating bacteria, nutrients and buffer compound which may demonstrate high potential as healing agent to be injected into porous network concrete (PNC). This type of concrete has a porous core which {{can be used as a}} media to transport healing agents into the fracture zone. The concept was tested in the 55 × 55 × 285 mm PNC prisms with 23 × 23 × 285 mm porous concrete core in the interior. Ø 2 mm threaded steel rebar was installed below the core. A crack was formed by three-point bending loading and the solution was injected through porous network until it reached and flew out through the crack opening. The bacteria then precipitated calcium carbonate blocking the crack. The healing efficiency was measured by water permeability test before and after injection at several time intervals. Second cycle mechanical loading was carried out to assess regain of mechanical properties. Eventually, calcite precipitation in the crack wall was examined by polished section with ESEM. Preliminary results showed more than 90 % permeability reduction has been achieved at 11 days which appeared to be temporary since after 19 days permeability reduction drop to 70 %. This could be attributed to the flushing of the solution after 11 days as the process could be not yet complete. However, bacteria imprints obtained from ESEM observation of polished section of Ø 26 - 30 mm cylindrical porous core 21 days after injection with the solution provided strong evidence of bacterial activity and confirm the previous observation. The on-going research program has been devised implementing tap water and bacteria-based solution injected specimens with wet and dry curing.

40|$|Bibliography: pages 71 - 74. It {{has become}} {{necessary}} to determine the magnitude of creep, shrinkage, elastic and thermal deformations of concrete as these characteristics determine the loss of prestressing in prestressed concrete and affect the deflections with time of large concrete sections. Much of the literature available on this topic has conflicting conclusions. In this research, the effect of fly ash was first investigated with regard to general concrete properties such as bleeding, early set, workability, mortar excess and compressive strength. Classified Lethabo fly ash and local Western Cape materials were used for this work. With {{the increase in the}} percentage fly ash present in the concrete mix, the water requirement was reduced {{in order to get the}} same workability. This characteristic reduced the amount of water available for bleeding. For a given C/W ratio the inclusion of fly ash in a concrete mix had no effect on the mortar excess. The early setting time was retarded for mixes with increasing percentages of fly ash. Higher cementitious material to water ratios were required for concrete with classified Lethabo fly ash than Ordinary Portland Cement mixes, to obtain the same 28 day compressive strength. The fly ash mixes had higher strength developments with time i. e. they have lower early strengths and higher long term strengths than OPC mixes for the same 28 day compressive strengths. Having developed a wide range of concrete mixes, the main investigation was done on specific deformation properties of concrete such as the elasticity, shrinkage, creep and thermal movement. The effect of different wet curing durations and testing ages on these properties were investigated. The elastic modulus was determined by both static and dynamic test methods. A relationship was established between the two methods to estimate the static modulus from the dynamic modulus, which was quicker to perform. In this thesis, the elastic modulus was not affected by the presence of fly ash. The elastic properties of the fly ash mixes was found to be similar to that of the OPC mixes of the same compressive strength. Similarly, the drying shrinkage and thermal movement were not affected noticeably by the presence of fly ash. The volume of aggregate was not a variable as it did not change when fly ash was added to the mix. An attempt was made to develop a test to determine the plastic shrinkage of an unrestrained sample. The effect of fly ash on the plastic shrinkage was not investigated fully. For the creep of concrete, it was established that mixes containing fly ash have lower creep factors than OPC concretes, although no clear trends were apparent for increasing percentages of fly ash. The effect of fly ash in pump mixes was also investigated and the same trends were apparent, although in general, the pump mixes had higher creep factors than the normal mixes. The curing of concrete is critical if good quality concrete is to be obtained. For all deformation properties, the longer a specimen was <b>wet</b> <b>cured,</b> the lower were the deformations. With longer wet curing, a larger volume of hydrated gel developed which gave higher compressive strengths and more rigidity within the matrix. The conclusion reached in this thesis was that the presence of classified Lethabo fly ash did not noticeably affect the deformation properties of the concrete for equivalent compressive strengths. Where some effects were noticed, the fly ash concretes displayed somewhat lower deformations...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{research}} into the moisture retention properties of saltstone suggest that osmotic pressure may play a potentially significant role in contaminant transport (Dixon et al., 2009 and Dixon, 2011). The Savannah River Remediation Closure and Disposal Assessments Group requested the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) to conduct a literature search on osmotic potential {{as it relates to}} contaminant transport and to develop a conceptual model of saltstone that incorporates osmotic potential. This report presents the findings of the literature review and presents a conceptual model for saltstone that incorporates osmotic potential. The task was requested through Task Technical Request HLW-SSF-TTR- 2013 - 0004. Simulated saltstone typically has very low permeability (Dixon et al. 2008) and pore water that contains a large concentration of dissolved salts (Flach and Smith 2013). Pore water in simulated saltstone has a high salt concentration relative to pore water in concrete and groundwater. This contrast in salt concentration can generate high osmotic pressures if simulated saltstone has the properties of a semipermeable membrane. Estimates of osmotic pressure using results from the analysis of pore water collected from simulated saltstone show that an osmotic pressure up to 2790 psig could be generated within the saltstone. Most semi-permeable materials are non-ideal and have an osmotic efficiency < 1 and as a result actual osmotic pressures are less than theoretical pressures. Observations from laboratory tests of simulated saltstone indicate that it may exhibit the behavior of a semi-permeable membrane. After several weeks of back pressure saturation in a flexible wall permeameter (FWP) the membrane containing a simulated saltstone sample appeared to have bubbles underneath it. Upon removal from the FWP the specimen was examined and it was determined that the bubbles were due to liquid that had accumulated between the membrane and the sample. One possible explanation for the accumulation of solution between the membrane and sample is the development of osmotic pressure within the sample. Osmotic pressure will affect fluid flow and contaminant transport and may result in the changes to the internal structure of the semi-permeable material. B�nard et al. 2008 reported swelling of <b>wet</b> <b>cured</b> Portland cement mortars containing salts of NaNO{sub 3 }, KNO{sub 3 }, Na{sub 3 }PO{sub 4 }x 12 H {sub 2 }O, and K{sub 3 }PO{sub 4 } when exposed to a dilute solution. Typically hydraulic head is considered the only driving force for groundwater in groundwater models. If a low permeability material containing a concentrated salt solution is present in the hydrogeologic sequence large osmotic pressures may develop and lead to misinterpretation of groundwater flow and solute transport. The osmotic pressure in the semi-permeable material can significantly impact groundwater flow {{in the vicinity of the}} semi-permeable material. One possible outcome is that groundwater will flow into the semi-permeable material resulting in hydrologic containment within the membrane. Additionally, hyperfiltration can occur within semi-permeable materials when water moves through a membrane into the more concentrated solution and dissolved constituents are retained in the lower concentration solution. Groundwater flow and transport equations that incorporate chemical gradients (osmosis) have been developed. These equations are referred to as coupled flow equations. Currently groundwater modeling to assess the performance of saltstone waste forms is conducted using the PORFLOW groundwater flow and transport model. PORFLOW does not include coupled flow from chemico-osmotic gradients and therefore numerical simulation of the effect of coupled flow on contaminant transport in and around saltstone cannot be assessed. Most natural semi-permeable membranes are non-ideal membranes and do not restrict all movement of solutes and as a result theoretical osmotic potential is not realized. Osmotic efficiency is a parameter in the coupled flow equation that accounts for the non-ideal behavior of most semi-permeable membranes. On order to evaluate the effects of osmotic potential on the hydraulic of a system the osmotic potential must be known. Several lab methods have been developed to measure osmotic efficiency for use in coupled flow analysis...|$|E

The results of both the inquiry and the laboratory study show the following: (1) epoxies are not suitable for the repair of the concrete surfaces located on hydraulic structures; (2) cement mortars and latex-modified cement mortars are the repair materials which perform the best on hydraulic structures; (3) physico-mechanical properties of cement mortars are improved when they are subjected to a <b>wet</b> <b>cure</b> while those of the latex-modified cement mortars are when they are subjected to 24 hours <b>wet</b> <b>cure</b> followed by a dry one; (4) cement mortars are generally more thermal compatible with concrete substrates when compared to latex-modified cement mortars; (5) shrinkage, which is generally larger on latex-modified cement mortars, greatly influence the performance of repair mortars...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical {{characteristics}} and durability of ground granulated {{blast furnace slag}} cement composites depends on the hydraulic activity of the slag. Algerian Blast furnace slag {{is characterized by a}} quite slow reactivity. Porosity and transport properties of mixes containing up to 50 % OPC replacement are compared and analyzed. Mechanical strength, pore size distribution and capillary water absorption are studied after 28 and 90 days of <b>wet</b> <b>curing.</b> The durability of blast furnace slag cement concrete is evaluated through nitrogen permeability and water penetration depth under pressure. First observations seem to indicate finer porosity and lower water absorption than with 100 % CEM I 52. 5 mortars. Moreover, lower permeabilities to nitrogen and water are also observed for 50 % blast furnace slag substitution. Peer reviewe...|$|R
50|$|As {{originally}} built, the Navigatori {{ships were}} insufficiently stable and too <b>wet.</b> <b>Cures</b> were applied in two stages, firstly in the mid-1930s when some superficial {{changes were made}} to reduce superstructures and move fuel bunkers, and subsequently in 1938-1940, when the beam was increased and bows raised. Displacement was increased thereby and speed significantly reduced. During World War II, several programmes were started to upgrade weaponry, in particular anti-aircraft weapons, but none were applied uniformly to all ships in the class. These included full triple 533mm torpedo mountings, 40mm guns replaced by greater numbers of 20mm ones, The after torpedo tubes were replaced by 37mm guns. Several ships were adapted for radar but ony two received the equipment; Leone Pancaldo had the Italian EC3/ter Gufo set and Lanzaretto Malocello had the German FuMo 26/40G.|$|R
40|$|The {{stabilized}} soil mass by bituminous emulsion is deformed when loaded {{as much as}} {{the other}} structures, but the behavior of its deformation is different corresponding to the value of load, speed of loading, water content and temperature of the sample. Generally speaking, in the case of small and rapid loading, low moisture and temperature, it is tended to show an elastic condition in which the stress is proportional to the strain, but in he other case it happens to flow plastically and becomes a viscoelastic state. The writers have experimentally measured the stresses and strains about the test pieces of soil bitumen being compressed at 1 mm/min rate of strain after the dry and <b>wet</b> <b>curing</b> formerly suggested. It is reported here to be investigated the results with a viscoelastic theory...|$|R
