40|$|Objective: To {{establish}} an animal model of alcoholic fatty liver (AFL) and {{to observe the}} prevention and treatment with New Qinggan Decoction (NQGD). Methods: Female SD rats {{were exposed to the}} mixture of <b>white</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>and</b> corn oil continuously for up to 6 weeks via an intragastric feeding protocol. The pathologic alteration of the liver and the changes of serum lipid were observed, and the effect of NQGD for preventing and treating AFL was studied. Results: Wide hepatic steatosis was induced in model group rats. Serum triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) of the model group were higher than those of the normal group (P< 0. 01). Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of the model group were higher than those of the normal group (P< 0. 05). In NQGD group, hepatic steatosis was milder than that in the model group, and serum TG, TC, AST, ALT descended significantly as compared with the model group (P< 0. 01). Conclusion: AFL model of rats established by feeding the mixture of <b>white</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>and</b> corn oil is similar to the episode of the human AFL, and is easy to intervene with medicine. NQGD can prevent the occurrence of AFL in this model...|$|R
5000|$|Gogmagog were a British {{supergroup}} {{put together}} by British record producer Jonathan King that featured former Iron Maiden members Paul Di'Anno and Clive Burr, former <b>White</b> <b>Spirit</b> <b>and</b> Gillan guitarist Janick Gers, Def Leppard guitarist Pete Willis, and bassist Neil Murray (Whitesnake and other bands). Two of the songs recorded were written by King; the third by composer Russ Ballard. Originally, the supergroup was to contain David Coverdale, John Entwistle and Cozy Powell, but this line-up [...] "wasn't working out", according to Di Anno. He also insisted that he hated the finished product and that he [...] "only did it for the money".|$|R

50|$|With the upsurge of the NWOBHM, <b>White</b> <b>Spirit</b> {{moved to}} the MCA label on which they {{released}} their first and only album in 1980. The album was simply titled <b>White</b> <b>Spirit</b> <b>and</b> featured cover artwork by Michael Spaldin who later worked on stage set design for Gillan. That same year <b>White</b> <b>Spirit</b> made an appearance at the prestigious Reading Festival. The group suffered a serious blow in 1981 when guitarist Janick Gers accepted an offer from former Deep Purple frontman Ian Gillan to join his solo outfit Gillan in place of Bernie Torme. Gers {{would go on to}} record the albums Double Trouble and Magic, before Ian Gillan decided to dissolve the band and join Black Sabbath for their 1983 album Born Again. Gers was part of the short lived UK supergroup Gogmagog, also featuring former members of Def Leppard, Iron Maiden and Whitesnake, who folded after releasing a sole EP, I Will Be There, in 1985.|$|R
40|$|Long term {{exposure}} to organic solvents {{is usually not}} considered as a possible cause of chronic epileptic seizures. A case that shows a remarkable coincidence between {{exposure to}} organic solvents and occurrence of epileptic seizures is reported. The man was a 58 year old sign writer with lifelong exposure to a mixture of organic solvents (mainly cyclohexanone, <b>white</b> <b>spirit,</b> <b>and</b> isopropanol). Epileptic seizures of temporal type were occurring in relation to solvent exposure.

40|$|Plasticized poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) sheets were {{irradiated}} with ultra-violet light before {{immersion in}} petroleum oils to prevent plasticizer migration and counterdiffusion effects.

Nevertheless, in agreement with previous experimental results on plasticizer migration behaviour, the ultra-violet treatment followed appears encouraging: the maximum penetration values do not vary significantly with irradiation time, but the equilibrium values eventually attained are positively influenced, presenting a decrease often close to 50 %. © 1990...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the intertextual references between Paule Constant's <b>White</b> <b>Spirit</b> <b>and</b> Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness. I argue that Constant's novel rewrites the European male colonialist's journey from a gendered perspective. The techniques used to achieve this include infusing Conrad's tale with heavily symbolic female characters, with male characters that belie the colonialists' sexual perversion, with animals that take on human characteristics, and with a colonial structure that emphasizes the sexually sordid aspect of empire. The article shows that Constant writes empire as an inherently sexual structure that impacts negatively upon all the characters' psyches, but most significantly upon women; while men suffer psychologically from the sexually perverse colonial society, the quest for whiteness to which the novel's title refers transforms, denigrates and denaturalizes both European and African women.

50|$|Oil {{paint is}} a type of slow-drying paint that {{consists}} of particles of pigment suspended in a drying oil, commonly linseed oil. The viscosity of the paint may be modified by the addition of a solvent such as turpentine or <b>white</b> <b>spirit,</b> <b>and</b> varnish may be added to increase the glossiness of the dried oil paint film. Oil paints have been used in Europe since the 12th century for simple decoration, but were not widely adopted as an artistic medium until the early 15th century. Common modern applications of oil paint are in finishing and protection of wood in buildings and exposed metal structures such as ships and bridges. Its hard-wearing properties and luminous colors make it desirable for both interior and exterior use on wood and metal. Due to its slow-drying properties, it has recently been used in paint-on-glass animation. Thickness of coat has considerable bearing on time required for drying: thin coats of oil paint dry relatively quickly.|$|R
40|$|Diffusional exchanges in {{plasticized}} PVC applications {{comprise a}} critical aspect {{of much of}} the published work, which has been intended to study plasticizer migration into simpler extractants, enabling the various parameters involved in migration to be studied in isolation. In this study the migration of dioctyl phthalate into petroleum oils is investigated with emphasis on prior sample history. Simultaneously, the penetration of the liquid environment into the sheets is monitored. Plasticized PVC samples were prepared containing different amounts of plasticizer. The samples are immersed in paraffin oil until the plasticizer concentration reaches a predetermined value. Afterwards the samples are immersed in <b>white</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>and</b> their migration behavior is compared with that of new samples containing this predetermined plasticizer content, i. e., excluding the prior desorption cycle. Under these experimental conditions the parameters studied include immersion time, immersion temperature, initial plasticizer content and specimen thickness. The results obtained, suggesting considerable restriction of the migration activity for the two-stages specimens, are discussed in terms of surface-depleted concentration profiles and structure rearrangement mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{repeated}} exposure to specific chemicals on the initiation or progression of mycosis fungoides (MF) remains unsettled. A patient with low-grade patch stage MF progressively developed MF plaques restricted to his arms, and a tumour {{on his right}} thigh. These areas were subject to repeated exposure to solvents. His thigh was indeed {{in close contact with}} his trousers pocket where he used to store a wiping rag drenched into <b>white</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>and</b> cellulosic thinner. Immunophenotyping these lesions revealed a dense LCA+, CD 2 +, CD 3 +, CD 4 +, CD 5 +, CD 7 +, CD 45 +, CD 45 RO+ T-cell infiltrate admixed with many factor XIIIa+ dendrocytes. T-cell receptor rearrangement analysis identified a monoclonal T-cell infiltrate. An internal work-up remained negative. Stopping further solvent exposure failed to improve his condition. Oral corticotherapy combined with low-dose interferon-alpha 2 a halted disease progression. This observation suggests that long-term solvent exposure may trigger MF and hasten its progression from the patch stage to the plaque and tumour stages. Copyright (C) 2004 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Now there was a little pause, while the carcases of the beasts were dragged out of her path, and the bloodstains covered from her eyes with fresh earth. Just as this task was finished there appeared, scrambling up the denga, and followed, by some men, a fat and hideous-looking woman, with fish bladders in her hair, and snake-skins tied about her, who, from her costume, Rachel knew at once must be an Isanuzi or witch-doctoress. Evidently she was in a fury, as might be seen by the workings of her face, and the extraordinary swiftness with which she moved notwithstanding her years and bulk.|$|R

40|$|Microfossil {{extraction}} from indurated mudrocks {{is widely}} acknowledged as challenging, especially for foraminifera. Here we report {{development of the}} freeze–thaw extraction method through the addition of rapid heating, detergent and ultrasound stages. We use indurated mudrock samples from the Toarcian (Early Jurassic) of Yorkshire, UK to assess the effectiveness and develop the freeze–thaw method. We compare our results from freeze–thaw with those from standard foraminifera processing techniques, {{including the use of}} hydrogen peroxide. Processing by freeze–thaw increased the degree of mudrock disaggregation and resulted in no damage or dissolution of foraminifera. Following the freeze–thaw method with treatment in <b>white</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>and</b> sodium hexametaphosphate aided the separation of foraminifera from the disaggregated clays and was twice as efficient as pressure washing. Samples processed with hydrogen peroxide contained damaged microfossils and an under representation of delicate calcareous foraminifera. Many other studies of indurated mudrocks have used hydrogen peroxide to extract foraminifera, and this might have resulted in apparently barren intervals. The freeze–thaw method outlined here provides a low-cost, low-risk and successful method of disaggregating and extracting calcareous microfossils from indurated mudrocks. We anticipate our method may be relevant for other fossil groups and merits further development...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is the {{analysis}} of electroneurographic and neurological findings at workers in chemical industry. An analysis of the working conditions in the cartridge and drying sections of paint and lacquer industry has shown an above permitted level of <b>white</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>and</b> toluene. The exposed group comprised 55 workers occupationally exposed to these noxae, whilst the control group included 35 workers who had never been exposed to the same agents. The exposed workers more frequently complained of numbness of the arm and leg, cramps in the shoulder and knee, and weakness in the arm and leg than did the control workers. The electromyoneurographic examination of the radial nerve showed that a decrease in motor and sensitive conduction velocity was more significant in the exposed group compared to the control. The reduction in motor and sensitive conduction velocity was in correlation with the length of exposure to the noxae. Terminal latency of the radial nerve was significantly longer in the exposed group compared to the control, with an increase proportional to the exposure length. The exposed workers had a significantly longer time of response to acoustic and visual stimuli. The results of the study suggest neurotoxic effects of the noxae detected in the cartridge and drying sections of paint and lacquer industry...|$|R
30|$|This {{research}} used effective {{techniques to}} identify {{the differences in the}} zinc stearate layer before <b>and</b> after a <b>white</b> <b>spirit</b> wash, as a conventional treatment, and an APP treatment, as an innovative technique, as applied to a TPU powder adhesive. Using an EDX investigation, it was possible to verify a reduction of the zinc species in the layer around the TPU particles, without compromising the blocking characteristics of the TPU adhesive following treatment, as the treatments essentially only affected the zinc stearate layer. Particle size investigations with optical microscopy, Beckman Coulter and SEM indicated that the zinc stearate layer is small in comparison to the TPU particle size. Therefore, the treatments acted only on the layer containing the zinc stearate lubricant. The crystallinity test showed a higher value for the TPU adhesive powder after both the <b>white</b> <b>spirit</b> wash <b>and</b> plasma treatments, which was attributed to an increase in the hard segments, which are responsible for the best cohesion and, thus, better peel resistance values.|$|R

40|$|A burner {{using an}} {{electrostatic}} method {{to produce and}} control a fuel spray is investigated for non-burning sprays. The burner has a charge injection nozzle and the liquid flow rate and charge injection rate are varied using hydrocarbon liquids of differing viscosities, surface tensions and electrical conductivities (kerosene, <b>white</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>and</b> diesel oil). Droplet size distributions are measured and it is shown how the dropsize, spray pattern, breakup mechanism and breakup length depend on the above variables, and in particular on the specific charge achieved in the spray. The data are valuable for validating two computer models under development. One predicts the electric field and flow field inside the nozzle {{as a function of}} emitter potential, geometry and flow rate. The other predicts the effect of charge on spray dispersion, with a view to optimizing spray combustion. It is shown that electrostatic disruptive forces can be used to atomize oils at flow rates commensurate with practical combustion systems and that the charge injection technique is particularly suitable for highly resistive liquids. Possible limitations requiring further research include the need to control the wide spray angle, which may provide fuel-air mixtures too lean near the nozzle, and the need to design for maximum charge injection rate, which is thought to be limited by corona breakdown in the gas near the nozzle orifice...|$|R
