25|$|Feelings of {{depression}} {{can cause a}} child to overeat. Researchers provided an in-home interview to 9,374 adolescents, in grades seven through 12 and discovered {{that there was not}} a direct correlation with children eating in response to depression.

Antidepressants, however, seem to have very little influence on childhood obesity. Researchers provided a depression questionnaire to 487 overweight/obese subjects and found that 7% of those with low depression symptoms were using antidepressants and had an average BMI score of 44.3, 27% of those with moderate depression symptoms were using antidepressants and had an average BMI score of 44.7, and 31% of those with major depression symptoms were using antidepressants and had an average BMI score of 44.2.|$|E
