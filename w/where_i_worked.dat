Presently I slipped away, and shutting myself up in the tiny room <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>worked,</b> drew out my papers. In a few minutes I had made a start.

They had just been shot out of the mouth of the viaduct and huddled together in a large pen.

60|$|My elder brother, {{for whom}} {{there was no}} place in the office <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>worked,</b> had found one in a store, and he beguiled the leisure that light trade left on his hands by reading the novels of Captain Marryat. I read them after him {{with a great deal of}} amusement, but without the passion that I {{bestowed}} upon my favorite authors. I believe I had no critical reserves in regard to them, but simply they did not take my fancy. Still, we had great fun with Japhet in 'Search of a Father', and with 'Midshipman Easy', and we felt a fine physical shiver in the darkling moods of 'Snarle-yow the Dog-Fiend.' I do not remember even the names of the other novels, except 'Jacob Faithful,' which I chanced upon a few years ago and found very, hard reading.|$|E

60|$|Near {{the end of}} March, 1845, I {{borrowed}} an axe {{and went}} down to the woods by Walden Pond, nearest to where I intended to build my house, and began to cut down some tall, arrowy white pines, still in their youth, for timber. It is difficult to begin without borrowing, but perhaps it is the most generous course thus to permit your fellow-men to have an interest in your enterprise. The owner of the axe, as he released his hold on it, said that it was the apple of his eye; but I returned it sharper than I received it. It was a pleasant hillside <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>worked,</b> covered with pine woods, through which I looked out on the pond, and a small open field in the woods where pines and hickories were springing up. The ice in the pond was not yet dissolved, though there were some open spaces, and it was all dark-colored and saturated with water. There were some slight flurries of snow during the days that I worked there; {{but for the most part}} when I came out on to the railroad, on my way home, its yellow sand heap stretched away gleaming in the hazy atmosphere, and the rails shone in the spring sun, and I heard the lark and pewee and other birds already come to commence another year with us. They were pleasant spring days, in which the winter of man's discontent was thawing as well as the earth, and the life that had lain torpid began to stretch itself. One day, when my axe had come off and I had cut a green hickory for a wedge, driving it with a stone, and had placed the whole to soak in a pond-hole in order to swell the wood, I saw a striped snake run into the water, and he lay on the bottom, apparently without inconvenience, as long as I stayed there, or more than a quarter of an hour; perhaps because he had not yet fairly come out of the torpid state. It appeared to me that for a like reason men remain in their present low and primitive condition; but if they should feel the influence of the spring of springs arousing them, they would of necessity rise to a higher and more ethereal life. I had previously seen the snakes in frosty mornings in my path with portions of their bodies still numb and inflexible, waiting for the sun to thaw them. On the 1st of April it rained and melted the ice, and in the early part of the day, which was very foggy, I heard a stray goose groping about over the pond and cackling as if lost, or like the spirit of the fog.|$|E

40|$|My essay {{deals with}} a problem in our society which, in my opinion, has been neglected. Even today in 2011, the quality of schools and preschools is {{extremely}} varied. This {{has been a problem}} {{for a long time and}} not nearly enough attention has been paid to it. In my essay I have tried to understand what it is that causes these differences in quality between preschools. With help from literature and research studies I have examined what quality in preschool really means. My starting point is an account of my own experience at the preschool <b>where</b> <b>I</b> currently <b>work</b> and a description of a study visit I made to another preschool which operates in a very different way to the one <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>work.</b> <b>I</b> wanted to investigate what the consequences are for children who grow up attending preschools of different quality. Do they have the same opportunities? My conclusion is that the problem is both more extensive and more complicated than I had first thought. It is high time that this problem received the attention it deserves and that radical changes are made in order to ensure that all children are provided with a learning environment of an equally high standard...|$|R
