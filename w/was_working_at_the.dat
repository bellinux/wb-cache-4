5|$|One {{month before}} the Senators were to open the new Palladium, after three-straight last place finishes, and poor {{attendance}} at the Civic Centre, the Senators organization was in turmoil.

5|$|Scholars have {{attempted}} {{for more than}} a century to understand who is portrayed in this painting. Earlier proposals that the subject was John III Sobieski (who would have been eight years old in 1637) or Stephen Bathory (who died in 1586) have been discredited. According to Otakar Odložilík, while the man in the painting is clearly wearing Polish garb, it is neither certain who he is, nor whether he is a Pole. Odložilík's research on this issue suggested that the painting may be that of Andrzej Rej, a Polish noble and diplomat of that era who passed through Amsterdam, the Netherlands, where Rembrandt <b>was</b> <b>working,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time the painting was created. Nonetheless, without any documents from that era clearly acknowledging that fact, as Odložilík noted, it may never be known for certain who the subject really is.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, {{inspired}} by Breizh Atao's message, Célestin Lainé, a reserve artillery officer, gathered {{a small group}} of companions to found Gwenn ha du, a terrorist organization advocating the creation of an independent Breton state through direct action. In August 1932, Gwenn ha du blew up a 400 year old monument dedicated to the union of Brittany and France. Lainé was arrested, however he was released after a former coworker provided him with an alibi. Gwenn ha du attracted the support of many young nationalists who became disillusioned with the failure of mainstream political parties to gain ground in formal elections. Gwenn ha du ceased its operations between 1933 and 1936, while Lainé <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Kuhlmann plant in Loos, French Flanders. There he established links with Flemish nationalists, who introduced him to , an Abwehr agent, who converted Lainé into Nordic neopaganism. Lainé returned to Brittany in 1937, relegating Gwenn ha du the responsibility of sabotage and forming Kadevernn a group that was intended to form the nucleus of a Breton national army. Lainé's most trusted supporters from the two groups were placed in Service Spécial, a secret special operations unit.|$|E
