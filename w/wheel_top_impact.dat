40|$|Abstract Background The impact {{factors of}} {{scientific}} journals are interesting but not unproblematic. It is {{speculated that the}} number of journals in which citations can be made correlates with the impact factors in any given speciality. Methods Using the Journal Citation Report (JCR) for 1997, a bibliometric analysis was made to assess the correlation between the number of journals available in different fields of clinical medicine and the <b>top</b> <b>impact</b> factor. A detailed study was made of dermatological journals listed in the JCR 1991 – 2000, to assess the relevance of this general survey. Results Using the 1997 JCR definitions of speciality journals, a significant linear correlation was found between the number of journals in a given field and the <b>top</b> <b>impact</b> factor of that field (rs = 0. 612, p Studying the trend for dermatological journals 1991 to 2000 a similar pattern was found. Significant correlations were also found between total number of journals and mean impact factor (rs = 0. 793, p = 0. 006), between the total number of journals and the <b>top</b> <b>impact</b> factor (rs = 0. 759, p = 0. 011) and between the mean and the <b>top</b> <b>impact</b> factor (rs = 0. 827, p = 0. 003). Conclusions The observations suggest {{that the number of}} journals available predict the <b>top</b> <b>impact</b> factor. For dermatology journals the top and the mean impact factor are predicted. This is in good agreement with theoretical expectations as more journals make more print-space available for more papers containing citations. It is suggested that new journals in dermatology should be encouraged, as this will most likely increase the impact factor of dermatological journals generally. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{responsiveness}} of {{the strain}} system of a bandmill {{is a critical}} factor for bandsaw performance and maintenance. The strain system applies the force, usually through the <b>top</b> <b>wheel,</b> that pulls that blade tight and gives the blade its stiffness. This paper discusses some experimental measurements of {{the movement of the}} <b>top</b> <b>wheel</b> during operation, and the implications related to design and maintenance. Strain System Functions The strain system, or <b>top</b> <b>wheel</b> assembly, has three functions: 1. Provide enough movement of the <b>top</b> <b>wheel</b> to change blades. 2. Apply the strain force to the blade. 3. Allow the <b>top</b> <b>wheel</b> to move as the blade length changes. but effectively still maintaining the same strain. Strain, guide position and blade thickness are the threc main factors that affect blade stiffness. The tighter the blade is pulled, the stiffer it will become. Strain also affects the tracking stability of the band on the wheels. The feed force bends the blade back during cutting. causing the band to track backwards. The more the blade bends the faster it moves on the wheels, so increasing th...|$|R

40|$|Master's thesis in Environmental technologyGas hydrate {{formation}} posses {{a notorious}} {{concern for the}} oil and gas industry, and it only gets bigger because of that the never-ending pursuit of oil and gas compels the industry into deeper and colder waters. Here gas hydrate can from and agglomerate into plugs, jeopardizing pipelines and process equipments. Therefore a variety of methods have been developed to inhibit gas hydrate formation, one of them being to utilize low dosage hydrate inhibitors, which consists of kinetic hydrate inhibitors and anti-agglomerants. Low dosage hydrate inhibitors are relatively expensive, and it is therefore important to determine effective concentrations in laboratory apparatuses. Test apparatuses and methods are numerous, and the majority are THF rigs, rocker rigs, autoclaves, pipe wheels and flow loops. Prior methods for assessing hydrate inhibitors performance concentration tend to suffer form not being repeatable in addition to be inconsistent. Thus there are always possible for new hydrate inhibition test methods and apparatuses. A prototype table <b>top</b> <b>wheel</b> was developed for testing low dosage hydrate inhibitors. It consisted of a wheel submerged in a water bath. Unique features of the table <b>top</b> <b>wheel</b> was its small size, the acrylic top disk and the mode of moving the liquid in the apparatus. A swirling circular motion made the liquid move based on the "Euler disk" mechanical movement, hence no pumps or internal equipment for propelling the liquid was utilized. Preliminary tests were conducted to approve the apparatus for future experimental work, by providing a gas hydrate formation method of a consistent manner. The result for the same anti-agglomerant range in both 1. 5 wt% NaCl solution and distilled water, obtained in the table <b>top</b> <b>wheel</b> was compared to the rocker rig RCS 20. This was done to confirm if this apparatus indeed could be used to rank inhibitors, thus a validation of the apparatus. It was confirmed that the table <b>top</b> <b>wheel</b> result for the same anti-agglomerant range in both 1. 5 wt% NaCl solution and distilled water had the same trend as the results from the rocker rig. The table <b>top</b> <b>wheel</b> was thereby validated and approved at least for this anti-agglomerant range. However, the concentration required for an adequate inhibition was higher in the table <b>top</b> <b>wheel</b> compared to the rocker rig, hence the table <b>top</b> <b>wheel</b> was a more conservative test apparatus than the rocker rig. Unfortunately the table <b>top</b> <b>wheel</b> could not be operated safely after 59 pressurized experiments, due to cracks in the acrylic top disk. This was a severely design flaws which must be sorted out for the apparatus to progress. However, as far as being a prototype the table <b>top</b> <b>wheel</b> approved to be adequate. It yielded reliable and predictable test results and provided a consistent method for both hydrate formation and inhibitor testing...|$|R
