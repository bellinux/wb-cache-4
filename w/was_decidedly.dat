5|$|In 1687, Sir Isaac Newton {{published}} his Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, {{in which he}} outlined his laws of gravity and motion. His work on comets <b>was</b> <b>decidedly</b> incomplete. Although he had suspected that two comets that had appeared in succession in 1680 and 1681 were the same comet before and after passing behind the Sun (he was later found to be correct; see Newton's Comet), {{he was unable to}} completely reconcile comets into his model.|$|E
5|$|It was {{originally}} mentioned by Franz Nopcsa in 1923 as a subfamily of Acanthopholidae, {{along with the}} previously defined Acanthopholinae. The family has gone through many taxonomic revisions since it was defined by Nopcsa in 1902. It is now recognized as a junior synonym of the family Nodosauridae. The subfamily now includes the genera Anoplosaurus, Europelta, Hungarosaurus, and Struthiosaurus, designated as the type genus. Because of the instability of Acanthopholis, the generic namesake of Acanthopholinae, and its current identification as a nomen dubium, Struthiosaurinae, the next named group, <b>was</b> <b>decidedly</b> used over the older one.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{this section}} Heilmann embarks on a {{thorough}} description of the Berlin Archaeopteryx specimen, which includes detailed comparisons to specific aspects of modern birds. Following a comparison of its skull to that of Aetosaurus, Euparkeria, and a modern pigeon, Heilmann states that he disagrees with the scientific consensus {{of the time that}} the skull of Archaeopteryx is that of a true bird. He writes that the reptilian features of the skull are much more pronounced, citing features of the teeth, fenestrae, and jaw structure as being undeniably un-birdlike. Heilmann found that much of Archaeopteryxs anatomy, in fact, <b>was</b> <b>decidedly</b> reptilian and generally opposed to that of modern birds. This included the pelvis, which lacks a pectineal process and has a very different os sacrum from modern birds, as well as the carpus, which Heilmann wrote exhibited the same phenomena found in the wrists of modern reptiles. Its tail was also noted by Heilmann as being extremely reptilian and resembling nothing known of modern birds.|$|E

5|$|Escher, who {{had been}} very fond of and {{inspired}} by the landscapes in Italy, <b>was</b> <b>decidedly</b> unhappy in Switzerland. In 1937, the family moved again, to Uccle (Ukkel), a suburb of Brussels, Belgium. World War II forced them to move in January 1941, this time to Baarn, Netherlands, where Escher lived until 1970. Most of Escher's best-known works date from this period. The sometimes cloudy, cold and wet weather of the Netherlands allowed him to focus intently on his work. After 1953, Escher lectured widely. A planned series of lectures in North America in 1962 was cancelled after an illness, and he stopped creating artworks for a time, but the illustrations and text for the lectures were later published {{as part of the}} book Escher on Escher. He was awarded the Knighthood of the Order of Orange-Nassau in 1955.|$|E
5|$|According {{to a story}} {{published}} in Century magazine in September 1898, Edwin Emerson, Jr., was {{pretending to be a}} German journalist. He presented himself to the German Consul in St. Thomas and asked for the names of Puerto Ricans of German descent whom he could interview. Among the names which the consul gave him were that of the Riefkohl family of the town of Maunabo. Upon his arrival in the town of Maunabo he met 14-year-old Rudolph W. Riefkohl and asked the lad in German if he had a map of Puerto Rico (Emerson had lost his). Riefkohl answered that he did, however it <b>was</b> <b>decidedly</b> too big for Emerson's use. Riefkohl returned home, not knowing that Emerson was a spy, and quickly drew another with a depiction of the major ports and harbors of Puerto Rico. Emerson used the map and it is believed by some that he may have given the map to the U.S. Army Commanding General, Nelson A. Miles, influencing Mile's decision on the landing points for the invasion of Puerto Rico. A photostatic copy of Riefkohl's map was {{published in}} the Century article.|$|E
5|$|Although too old {{to serve}} in the military, Blackburn {{supported}} the Confederate cause during the Civil War. In {{the early days of the}} war, he acted as a civilian agent for the governments of Kentucky and Mississippi. By 1863, he was aiding Confederate blockade runners in Canada. In 1864, he traveled to Bermuda to help combat a yellow fever outbreak that threatened Confederate blockade running operations there. Shortly after the war's end, a Confederate double agent accused him of having carried out a plot to start a yellow fever epidemic in the Northern United States that would have hampered the Union war effort. Blackburn was accused of collecting linens and garments used by yellow fever patients and smuggling them into the Northern states to be sold. The evidence against Blackburn was considerable, although much of it was either circumstantial or provided by witnesses of questionable reputation. Although he was acquitted by a Toronto court, public sentiment <b>was</b> <b>decidedly</b> against him throughout much of the United States. Today, historians still disagree as to the strength of the evidence supporting Blackburn's role in the alleged plot. Any plot of this nature was destined to fail, however; in 1900, Walter Reed discovered that yellow fever is spread by mosquitoes, not by contact.|$|E

5|$|Alexander {{embarked}} on his expedition {{to conquer the}} Persian Empire {{in the spring of}} 334BC, having pacified the warring Greek states and consolidated his military might. During the first months of the Macedonian passage into Persian Asia Minor, Darius III – king of Persia – largely ignored the presence of Alexander's 40,000men. The Battle of the Granicus, fought in May, was Persia's first major effort to confront the invaders, but resulted in an easy victory for Alexander. Over the next year, Alexander took most of western and coastal Asia Minor by forcing the capitulation of the satrapies in his path. He continued inland, travelling northeast through Phyrgia before turning southeast toward Cilicia. After passing the Cilician Gates in October, Alexander was delayed by fever in Tarsus. Darius meanwhile mustered an army of up to 100,000 (some ancient sources posit exaggerated figures of over 600,000) and personally directed it over the eastern slopes of the Amanus Mountains. In early November, as Alexander proceeded about the Gulf of Issus from Mallus via Issus, the two armies inadvertently passed one another {{on opposite sides of the}} mountains. This <b>was</b> <b>decidedly</b> to Darius' advantage: now at the rear of Alexander, he was able to prevent retreat and block the supply lines Alexander had established at Issus. It was not until Alexander had encamped at Myriandrus, a seaport on the southeastern shores of the Gulf of İskenderun, that he learned of the Persian position. He immediately retraced his route to the Pinarus River, just south of Issus, to find Darius' force assembled along the northern bank. The Battle of Issus ensued.|$|E

25|$|While the 17th- {{and early}} 18th-century American {{philosophical}} tradition <b>was</b> <b>decidedly</b> marked by religious themes and the Reformation reason of Ramus, the 18th century saw more reliance {{on science and}} the new learning of the Age of Enlightenment, along with an idealist belief in the perfectibility of human beings through teaching ethics and moral philosophy, laissez-faire economics, and a new focus on political matters.|$|E

25|$|Unfortunately, Harris's {{performance}} in his 250th match was curtailed by a serious shoulder injury, {{and for some}} time the future of his career was in doubt. In his early post-shoulder injury games, {{he was forced to}} remove the medium slow from his repertoire, and <b>was</b> <b>decidedly</b> less effective. Performances for the New Zealand A side in September 2005 were more promising, however, with several very economical performances against Sri Lanka A.|$|E
25|$|The bent of {{his mind}} <b>was</b> <b>decidedly</b> political. He was a natural born politician. Politics was his meat and drink, and nothing so delighted him as the {{opportunity}} to engage in political discussion {{in which he was}} apt to engross most of the time. On the stump he was a formidable antagonist and his experiences in this respect has probably never been equaled in Perry County. His knowledge of the roads, streams and by paths, the ravings and hollows, the school houses and places of public resort in Perry county was surpassed by no one.|$|E
25|$|The {{membership}} of the new Congress <b>was</b> <b>decidedly</b> federalist. In the eleven-state (minus North Carolina and Rhode Island) Senate 20 were Federalist and two Anti-federalist (both from Virginia). The House included 48 Federalists and 11 Anti-federalists (from four states: Massachusetts, New York, South Carolina, and Virginia). On April 6 the House and Senate held a joint meeting to count the electoral vote. George Washington was unanimously elected the first president, even receiving the electoral vote of ardent anti-federalist Patrick Henry. John Adams of Massachusetts was elected vice president. Both were sworn into office on April 30, 1789. The business of setting up the new government was completed.|$|E

25|$|The royal {{connection}} to Northampton Castle became less significant, {{and by the}} time of the English Civil War, Northampton <b>was</b> <b>decidedly</b> pro-Parliament. Though Spencer Compton, Earl of Northampton, was a royalist (Cavalier) and backed King Charles I, the people of Northampton supported Parliament and Oliver Cromwell's republican Roundhead army. The town had a long history of religious dissent from the Lollards and Puritanism gained a strong hold on the town. The corporation of the town, having already refused to provide troops to the King in 1632 or to pay the notorious ship money tax in 1636, petitioned Parliament in 1642 against papists and bishops.|$|E
25|$|Another {{major change}} made was that Lois {{did not fall}} in love with just Superman, {{although}} she was attracted to him. One reason was the revised nature of the Superman/Clark Kent relationship. In the original Silver Age stories, Superman had been the man who disguised himself as Clark Kent. In this newly revised concept, it was Clark Kent who lived a life in which his activity as Superman <b>was</b> <b>decidedly</b> secondary. Lois initially resented the rookie Clark Kent getting the story on Superman as his first piece when she had spent ages trying to get an interview. This sometimes ill-tempered rivalry remained the case until The Adventures of Superman #460–463 and Action Comics #650.|$|E
25|$|Lutz founded her own {{organization}} {{in conjunction with}} American suffragist Carrie Chapman Catt in 1922, the Brazilian Federation for the Advancement of Women, which would become the leading suffrage organization of Brazil and was affiliated with the International Women's Suffrage Alliance. Brazilian suffragettes were literate, professional women who made up {{only a small percentage}} of the female population in Brazil, the latter which remained largely illiterate. Hence, the campaign for suffrage was by no means a mass movement, and <b>was</b> <b>decidedly</b> moderate in nature. The conservative character of the suffrage movement provoked little resistance from government, and suffrage was declared by Getúlio Vargas in 1932 and later confirmed in the 1934 Constitution.|$|E

25|$|The {{proposal}} was immediately derided and denied by the HBC governing committee. They feared {{that if the}} Oragon Beef and Tallow Company were successful then HBC members would quit the fur trade to become pastorialists and agriculturalists. While Simpson was favorable {{to the idea of}} growing expansive numbers of livestock and farmlands, he <b>was</b> <b>decidedly</b> against McLoughlin's stance of independent men supplying the provisions for trade in Russian America and the Kingdom of Hawaii. Late in 1834, agreeing to Simpson's idea of the HBC directly overseeing these proposed operations, the committee considered a new central depot for operations on the Pacific Coast. Previous outbreaks of disease at Fort Vancouver worried the administrators, who ordered McLoughlin thoroughly examine Whidbey Island and other potential locations north of the Columbia River, although he had done neither by 1837.|$|E
25|$|All {{of these}} {{advantages}} may in other circumstances have availed Nanavati nothing, for a pardon {{might have been}} seen by the press and public at other times as a blatant misuse of power to help the crony of an influential political family. However, public opinion, in the largely conservative country, <b>was</b> <b>decidedly</b> in favour of Nanavati, seen as an upright naval officer with middle class values and {{a strong sense of}} honour. Public opinion held the sentence of life in prison was too harsh and supported a proposal, mooted by the Blitz, to grant a pardon to the naval officer. The Blitz magazine played a significant part in raising public opinion in favour of Nanavati and keeping the issue alive for over three years until the pardon was granted.|$|E
25|$|In 1882 he was {{appointed}} the medical director of a small, modern and privately run psychiatric clinic at Marin in the Swiss Canton of Neuchâtel where he was provided with a laboratory to continue his research. In 1888 he pioneered modern psychosurgery when he excised various brain regions from six psychiatric patients under his care. Aimed at relieving symptoms rather than effecting a cure, the theoretical basis of the procedure rested on his belief that psychiatric illnesses {{were the result of}} specific brain lesions. He reported the results at a Berlin medical conference in 1889 but the reception of his medical peers <b>was</b> <b>decidedly</b> negative and he was ridiculed. Burckhardt subsequently discontinued his research activities. Following the death of his wife in 1896 Burckhardt returned to Basel where he established a sanatorium in 1900. He died seven years later from pneumonia.|$|E
