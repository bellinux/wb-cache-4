Finally, after being surprised by a bright light and loud music, he enters what appears to be an underground geodesic dome with computer equipment, including an Apple II Plus computer with its prompt glowing and its shift key relabeled execute. As Jack is about to use it, Locke appears and tells Jack not to touch it. After Jack raises the gun and asks where Kate is, Locke is revealed to be at gunpoint.

Finally, the gunman steps out and Jack seems to recognize him. The gunman is Desmond.|$|E

500|$|... "No Russian" [...] is {{the fourth}} single-player level in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. It begins with the player leaving an {{elevator}} with four gunmen, who proceed to open fire {{on a group of}} civilians at a security checkpoint. The player then accompanies the gunmen as they walk through the airport killing any remaining civilians. [...] "No Russian" [...] is noticeably more graphic than any other level in the game; civilians screams can be heard throughout, while the injured crawl away leaving blood trails. The player is not forced to shoot any civilians however, and may instead walk through the airport as the massacre unfolds. Additionally, the player can shoot the gunmen, but the leader cannot die and the gunmen <b>will</b> <b>shoot</b> back.|$|E

500|$|On 10 April, in {{response}} to the request, two US Air Force F-16s dropped bombs on Serb targets, including a tank and a command post. The next day, two US Marine Corps F/A-18C aircraft strafed additional targets in the area. That same day, General Ratko Mladić, the commander of the Bosnian Serb army, called General Rose and threatened the safety of his forces, saying [...] "one more attack and I <b>will</b> <b>shoot</b> down aircraft– cannot guarantee safety of UNPROFOR and will attack UNPROFOR and your headquarters". Making good on his threat, from 12 April to 14 April, Mladić ordered his forces to surround 150 UNPROFOR peacekeepers, effectively taking them hostage. Mladić then telephoned General Rose and told him [...] "that if NATO did not stop its actions, not one UN soldier would leave alive". Some of the UNPROFOR hostages were from NATO member states, notably the United Kingdom and France, who pushed for an immediate end to the strikes out of fear for the safety of their personnel. In response to the British and French concerns, NATO temporarily recalled its forces, but on 15 April, {{in response}} to increased Serb attacks, aircraft were again deployed to the area.|$|E
500|$|HM Prison Maze was {{considered}} one of the most escape-proof prisons in Europe. In addition to [...] fences, each H-Block was encompassed by an [...] concrete wall topped with barbed wire, and all gates on the complex were made of solid steel and electronically operated. Prisoners had been planning the escape for several months. Bobby Storey and Gerry Kelly had started working as orderlies in H7, which allowed them to identify weaknesses in the security systems, and six handguns had been smuggled into the prison. Shortly after 2:30 pm on 25 September, prisoners seized control of H7 by simultaneously taking the prison officers hostage at gunpoint in order to prevent them from triggering an alarm. One officer was stabbed with a craft knife, and another was knocked down by a blow to the back of the head. One officer who attempted to prevent the escape was shot in the head by Gerry Kelly, but survived. By 2:50 pm the prisoners were in control of H7 without an alarm being raised. A dozen prisoners also took uniforms from the officers, and the officers were also forced to hand over their car keys and details of where their cars were, for possible later use during the escape. A rearguard was left behind to watch over hostages and keep the alarm from being raised until they believed the escapees were clear of the prison, when they returned to their cells. At 3:25 pm, a lorry delivering food supplies arrived at the entrance to H7, whereupon Brendan McFarlane and other prisoners took the occupants hostage at gunpoint and took them inside H7. The lorry driver was told the lorry was being used in the escape, and he was instructed what route to take and how to react if challenged. Storey told the driver, [...] "This man [...] is doing 30 years and he <b>will</b> <b>shoot</b> you without hesitation if he has to. He has nothing to lose." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, {{the manager}} of Capri Anderson said, [...] "A {{contract}} girl will only shoot for one company, she won’t shoot for anyone else.

In one year, a contract girl <b>will</b> <b>shoot,</b> on average, four movies and each movie takes {{about two or three}} weeks to shoot." ...|$|E

It is this accuracy and power, and the versatility of also being capable of using less-expensive, milder [...]38 Special ammunition, that makes a [...]357 Magnum revolver an excellent gun for many different disciplines, from 20 yards' (18 m) precision shooting to long-range falling-plate events. It is an excellent round for those considering handloading ammunition, as it is economical and consistently performs well.|$|E

2500|$|Extra ball: If {{a player}} has earned this, {{when they lose}} a ball they get another one to play {{immediately}} afterward and the machine does not count the lost ball towards the limit of balls for that game. For example, if the player were on ball two and they earn an extra ball, the next ball will still be counted as ball two instead of the third ball. When a machine says [...] "SHOOT AGAIN" [...] on the scoreboard, it signifies that an extra ball <b>will</b> <b>shoot.</b> In a multiplayer game, the player who just lost the ball {{is the same one}} to shoot again.|$|E

When this happens, the music changes and the other plants and zombies stop moving while that zombie enters the house. Crunching sounds will be heard, accompanied by a scream and a message saying [...] "The zombies ate your brains!" [...] The game will then end and display the Game Over dialog box.|$|E
