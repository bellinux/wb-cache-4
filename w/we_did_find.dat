25|$|Milk {{is not an}} {{important}} source of vitamins B12 or E in the North American diet, so the effects of pasteurization on the adult daily intake of these vitamins is negligible.. However, milk is considered {{an important}} source of vitamin A, and because pasteurization appears to increase vitamin A concentrations in milk, the effect of milk heat treatment on this vitamin is a not a major public health concern. Results of meta-analyses revealed that pasteurization of milk leads to a significant decrease in vitamin C and folate, but milk also is not {{an important source of}} these vitamins. However, <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>find</b> a significant decrease in vitamin B2 concentrations after pasteurization. Vitamin B2 is typically found in bovine milk at concentrations of 1.83mg/liter. Because the recommended daily intake for adults is 1.1mg/day, milk consumption greatly contributes to the recommended daily intake of this vitamin. With the exception of B2, pasteurization {{does not appear to be}} a concern in diminishing the nutritive value of milk because milk is often not a primary source of these studied vitamins in the North American diet.|$|E
2500|$|The Kanins {{rented a}} house in Malibu for their honeymoon, and after buying an A. J. Liebling New Yorker short story about a {{boarding}} house for boxers, they spent [...] {{the next six months}} writing the adaptation, Sunday Punch (1942). They knew they were on the track to a partnership when MGM bought the screenplay. [...] "We would make a story outline together with rather detailed descriptions of the scenes. Then we divided up the writing, each taking the scenes we felt strongly about. Then [...] {{one or the other of}} us would put it all together into a single draft. <b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>find</b> a common voice, though we had different strengths. As an artist, Michael brought a great visual sense to the process. I was a people person who loved the characters and the dialogue. Through the collaboration, we learned a lot from each other and about each other. But the time came when I felt as if we were together 48 hours a day. Writing with someone else always requires some degree of compromise, as does marriage. When it came down to the question of which would survive, the marriage or the writing partnership, it was a pretty easy decision. But I [...] remember that it was a challenge convincing the powers that be that we had been successful writers individually and would be again. We were hyphenated in people's minds: Fay-and-Michael Kanin. To again become Fay Kanin and Michael Kanin took some doing." ...|$|E

It was like that every day. The farther we got, the worse it became. Our flock grew smaller and smaller. Those who escaped the terrible guns would be so frightened that they would forget to follow their leader and would fly in {{different}} directions and later perhaps join other flocks. So it was that when at last we reached the place in the sunny Southland for which we had started, Mr. Quack and I were alone. What became of our twelve children I don't know.

60|$|And so it did, {{with the}} result that in another twenty minutes me and young Milberry and the bull-pup in its hamper were in a third-class {{carriage}} on our way to Birmingham. Then the difficulties of the chase began to occur to me. Suppose by luck I was right; suppose the pup was booked for the Birmingham Dog Show; and suppose by a bit more luck a gent with a hamper answering description had been noticed getting out of the 5.13 train; then where were we? We might have to interview every cabman in the town. As likely as not, by the time <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>find</b> the kid, it wouldn't be worth the trouble of unpacking. Still, it wasn't my cue to blab my thoughts. The father, poor fellow, was feeling, I take it, just about as bad as he wanted to feel.

60|$|At last <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>find</b> {{ourselves}} on the prairie, amid the waving grass, {{with the land}} rolling on before us in a succession of gentle sweeps, never rising so as to impede the view, or apparently changing in its general level, but yet without the monotony of flatness. We were on the prairie, but still I felt no satisfaction. It was private property, divided among holders and pastured over by private cattle. Salisbury Plain is as wild, and Dartmoor almost wilder. Deer, they told me, were to be had within reach of Dixon, but for the buffalo one has to go much farther afield than Illinois. The farmer may rejoice in Illinois, but the hunter and the trapper must cross the big rivers and pass away into the Western Territories before he can find lands wild enough for his purposes. My visit to the corn-fields of Illinois was in its way successful, but I felt, as I turned my face eastward toward Chicago, that I {{had no right to}} boast that I had as yet made acquaintance with a prairie.|$|E

6000|$|We {{may prove}} {{anything}} if we argue, {{now that the}} poets retain the tradition of obsolete things, now that they modernise {{as much as they}} please. Into this method of reasoning, after duly considering it, I am unable to come with enthusiasm, being wedded to the belief that the poets say what they mean. Were it otherwise, did they not mean what they say, their evidence would be of no value; they might be dealing throughout in terms for things which were unrepresented in their own age. To prove this possible, it would be necessary to adduce convincing and sufficient examples of early national poets who habitually use the terminology of an age long prior to their own in descriptions of objects, customs, and usages. Meanwhile, it is obvious that my whole argument has no archaeological support. We may find [...] "Mycenaean" [...] corslets and greaves, but they are not in cremation burials. No Homeric cairn with Homeric contents has ever been discovered; and if <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>find</b> examples of Homeric cairns, it appears, from the poems, that they would very seldom contain the arms of the dead.|$|E
6000|$|Friedrich himself, {{without waiting}} for the rear of his force, and some while before this mist fell (as I judge), is pushing forward, [...] "a miller lad for his guide," [...] across to Hennersdorf,--Katholisch-Hennersdorf, a long straggling Village, eight or ten miles off, and itself two miles long,--where he understands the Saxons are. Miller lad guides us, over height and hollow, with his best skill, at a brisk pace;--through one hollow, where he has known the cattle pasture in summer time; but which proves impassable, and mere {{quagmire}}, at this season. No getting through it, you unfortunate miller lad (GARCON DE MEUNIER). Nevertheless, <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>find</b> passage through the skirts of it: nay this quagmire proved the luck of us; for the enemy, trusting to it, had no outguard there, never expecting us on that side. So that the vanguard, Ziethen and rapid Hussars, made an excellent thing of it. Ziethen sends us word, That he has got {{into the body of}} Hennersdorf,--"found the Saxon Quartermaster quietly paying his men;"--that he, Ziethen, is tolerably master of Hennersdorf, and will amuse the enemy till the other force come up.|$|E
60|$|As soon as {{we reached}} the point on the great {{northern}} road, or that which led towards Skeenesborough, Herman Mordaunt was obliged to quit his wagons, and to put all the females on horseback. The most necessary of the stores were placed on pack-horses; and, after a delay of half a day, time lost in making these arrangements, we proceeded. The wagons were to follow, but at a slow pace, the ladies being compelled to abandon them {{on account of the}} ruggedness of the ways, which would have rendered their motion not easy to be borne. Our cavalcade and train of footmen made a respectable display along the uneven road, which soon became very little more than a line cut through the forest, with an occasional wheel-track, but without the least attempt to level the surface of the ground by any artificial means.
