40|$|We {{investigated}} the thrips fauna on wheat and we discovered 15 species. The most numerous was <b>wheat</b> <b>thrips</b> Haplothrips tritici Kurdjumov. In {{the same time}} we {{investigated the}} thrips fauna on the plants of the spontaneous flora in the bordering belt surrounding wheat. We collected thrips on 23 plants of the spontaneous flora. A total of 649 thrips specimens have been collected and 32 thrips spieces were identified. The most numerous species was the Onion thrips Thrips tabaci Lindeman. For this species low presence was recorded on wheat and grasses, but high presence on the spontaneous plants. The second most numerous species was Aeolothrips intermedius Bagnall. We found the specimens of this species in great number on wheat {{as well as on the}} spontaneous plants surrounding it. 14 species were common for wheat and the spontaneous plants. Sorensen's index of faunistic similarity was 0. 6...|$|E
40|$|In Transylvania, the {{evolution}} of wheat insect pests is strongly influenced by the ecotehnological conditions, by climate change and current technology (Malschi, 2009 Malschi et al., 2015). The paper presents the dynamics and importance of the main pests of <b>wheat</b> (<b>thrips,</b> aphids, leafhoppers, wheat flies, cereals sunbugs, investigated under the integrated pest control system suitable of the area. During 2015 - 2016, the investigations were conducted at the Agricultural Research and Development Station Turda, from the wheat no tillage cultural system with cereal rotation of three years and applying all zonal recommendations of technology and phytosanitary complex. The pest monitoring was performed based on the samples collected with entomological net, by decadal 100 sweep-net catches/sample. The study data shows {{the danger of the}} attack of abundant populations of wheat flies (Phorbia securis, Delia coarctata, Opomyza florum, Oscinella frit etc.; wheat fleas (Chaetocnema aridula) and cereal leaf beetle (Oulema melanopa); leafhoppers (Psammotettix alienus, Javesella pellucida, Macrosteles laevis); aphids (Sitobion avenae, Schizaphis graminum, Rhopalosiphum padi); thrips (Haplothrips tritici), sunbugs (Eurygaster maura, Aelia acuminata) etc., and the necessity of applying insecticide treatments on the vegetation. Since 2015, a stronger impact of global warming on the wheat pests structure (%) are found. This change began on the last ten years. The importance of cereal sunbugs is increasing, well as the importance of the wheat flies, aphids and leafhoppers, which requires professional study on the pest dynamics and adequate integrated control of wheat pests...|$|E
40|$|The <b>wheat</b> <b>thrips,</b> Haplothrips tritici, {{is known}} from across eastern Europe and {{adjoining}} areas of Asia into western Europe and north Africa, and {{is widely regarded}} as a pest of cultivated cereal crops, particularly of Triticum but also of Hordeum (Özsisli 2011). The identity of this thrips species is not in doubt, but a closely similar species, Haplothrips cerealis, was described from Egypt (Priesner 1939), and subsequently recorded between southeastern Europe and Iran (see Minaei & Mound 2008). Priesner based this species on an unspecified number of specimens of both sexes, collected from the ears of cultivated wheat at “Wadi Gederât, Sinai”, and did not designate a holotype. Minaei and Mound (2010) indicated that they considered the records of cerealis from Iran to be based on misidentifications of tritici, but they suggested that further studies were required to determine if there is any evidence that these names represent different species in other countries. The problems arise because the published descriptions of, and comparisons between, the two species are confusing and sometimes contradictory. The objective of this report is to examine the published literature, and to consider this in relation to observed structural variation in recently collected samples as well as specimens in museums that are variously labeled as one or other of these two species. Literature references to females The original description (Priesner 1939) states that cerealis differs from tritici in having shorter postocular, prothoracic and abdominal setae that are sharply pointed, whereas those of tritici are rounded at the tip, and that cerealis also differ...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} contribution to Integrated Pest Management in stored-product protection can be provided by the light-filth method since it gives {{particular attention to the}} extraneous particles contaminating food (such as insects, insect fragments, mites, hairs, feather barbules, etc.), extending to the identification of the material from which they have originated or the animals and vegetables from which they derive or have been part of in the past. In this regard, semolina produced by an industrial mill (processing 500 t of durum wheat per day) located in South Italy was examined for light filth according to the method established by Italian regulation. During the investigations we verified the presence of insect fragments in 250 semolina samples collected from June 2008 to July 2009. Our results show that the number of insect fragments found in the samples (from 0 to 15 fragments per 50 g semolina) remained below the limit of 75 fragments per 50 g flour established by the Italian regulation. The fragments of arthropods found in the semolina samples had different origins. Numerous fragments came from both immature and adult insects infesting plants of <b>wheat</b> in fields (<b>thrips</b> and aphids); many other fragments belong to internal feeding insects and external feeding insects (Sitophilus spp., Rhyzopertha dominica, Tribolium spp., Cryptolestes spp., Oryzaephilus spp., and Nemapogon granellus) which are able to infest cereals during post-harvest processing or to colonize mill-rooms in which dusts, cereal debris, and flour residues are present. We also found fragments associable to structural pests like flies and psocids that are present in environments contaminated by mould spores and fungal hyphae. The results revealed that the fumigation of the mill realized in August 2008 did not modify the number of fragments contaminating the semolina, which remained at the same level during the 14 months of the experiment...|$|R
