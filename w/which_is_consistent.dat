5|$|In {{the case}} of the weak interaction, fermions can {{exchange}} three distinct types of force carriers known as the W+, W−, and Z bosons. The mass of each of these bosons is far greater than the mass of a proton or neutron, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> with the short range of the weak force. The force is in fact termed weak because its field strength over a given distance is typically several orders of magnitude less than that of the strong nuclear force or electromagnetic force.|$|E
5|$|The 1430s dating is {{supported}} by the style of the underdrawing, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> with known signed works by van Eyck from that time. In addition, the figures are dressed in clothes fashionable in the 1420s {{with the exception of one}} of the possible donors, tentatively identified as Margaret of Bavaria, who is depicted as the sybil standing in the right foreground of the crucifixion panel and wears clothes in style in the early 1430s.|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} some glyphs are {{modified}} with the “guiding star” dependent glyph, while others are not, supports the idea that rongorongo was used for calendrical purposes in addition to astronomy and navigation. This is further evidenced by a tentative reading <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> with known astronomy. In the month of March, Rigel, Arcturus, and Sirius can be seen together, and the Milky Way appears in the north {{to the right of}} Arcturus. If one were sailing north, they would first see Arcturus on the horizon, and then Polaris. The arrangement of glyphs in this example, and the presence of 'guide modifiers' on Arcturus and Polaris, are consistent with these facts.|$|E

Alternative etymologies are supported by numerous orthographic variations in medieval documents, with Samuel Seyer enumerating 47 alternative forms.|$|E
5|$|A 2013 {{study by}} Joseph E. Peterson and colleagues {{identified}} lesions in skulls of Stegoceras and other pachycephalosaurs, which were interpreted as infections caused by trauma. Lesions {{were found on}} 22% of sampled pachycephalosaur skulls (a frequency consistent across genera), but were absent from flat-headed specimens (which have been interpreted as juveniles or females), <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> with use in intra-specific combat (for territory or mates). The distribution of lesions in these animals tended to concentrate {{at the top of}} the dome, which supports head-butting behaviour. Flank-butting would probably result in fewer injuries, which would instead be concentrated on the sides of the dome. These observations were made while comparing the lesions with those on the skulls and flanks of modern sheep skeletons. The researchers noted that modern head-butting animals use their weapons for both combat and display, and that pachycephalosaurs could therefore also have used their domes for both. Displaying a weapon and willingness to use it can be enough to settle disputes in some animals.|$|E
5|$|Hubble {{has helped}} resolve some long-standing {{problems}} in astronomy, {{as well as}} raising new questions. Some results have required new theories to explain them. Among its primary mission targets was to measure distances to Cepheid variable stars more accurately than ever before, and thus constrain {{the value of the}} Hubble constant, the measure of {{the rate at which the}} universe is expanding, which is also related to its age. Before the launch of HST, estimates of the Hubble constant typically had errors of up to 50%, but Hubble measurements of Cepheid variables in the Virgo Cluster and other distant galaxy clusters provided a measured value with an accuracy of ±10%, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> with other more accurate measurements made since Hubble's launch using other techniques. The estimated age is now about 13.7 billion years, but before the Hubble Telescope scientists predicted an age ranging from 10 to 20 billion years.|$|E

5|$|On St Andrew's Hill, to the north-west of Cullompton town centre, two Roman forts were {{discovered}} in 1984 by aerial photography carried out for Devon County Council. The earlier, smaller fort (the boundary ditches of which showed up in cropmarks) was later replaced by a second, larger fort. The ramparts of this second fort are preserved on two sides as modern field boundaries with substantial earthen banks with hedges on top. The banks on the other two sides were removed shortly before the site was recognised as Roman. The site was made a scheduled monument in 1986. The aerial photography also revealed two subsidiary military enclosures or annexes to each fort. In 1992 a geophysical survey {{was made of the}} fort and areas to the east and west and this was followed by a trial excavation {{to the west of the}} site. These confirmed the existence of two forts, and the ditch of the second fort was excavated. Pottery from the site was dated from around 50–70 AD, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> with a previous date of before 75 AD based on finds from fieldwalking. A Roman settlement near Shortlands Lane was excavated in 2009. A large quantity of Roman pottery, burial remains and fragments of hypocaust tile from the second and third century was found.|$|E
5|$|The δ ring is {{circular}} {{and slightly}} inclined. It shows significant unexplained azimuthal variations in normal optical depth and width. One {{possible explanation is}} that the ring has an azimuthal wave-like structure, excited by a small moonlet just inside it. The sharp outer edge of the δ ring is in 23:22 resonance with Cordelia. The δ ring consists of two components: a narrow optically dense component and a broad inward shoulder with low optical depth. The width of the narrow component is 4.1–6.1km and the equivalent depth is about 2.2km, which corresponds to a normal optical depth of about 0.3–0.6. The ring's broad component is about 10–12km wide and its equivalent depth is close to 0.3km, indicating a low normal optical depth of 3×10−2. This is known only from occultation data because Voyager 2's imaging experiment failed to resolve the δ ring. When observed in forward-scattering geometry by Voyager 2, the δ ring appeared relatively bright, which is compatible with the presence of dust in its broad component. The broad component is geometrically thicker than the narrow component. This is supported by the observations of a ring plane-crossing event in 2007, when the δ ring remained visible, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> with the behavior of a simultaneously geometrically thick and optically thin ring.|$|E
