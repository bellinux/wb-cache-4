Trees in these severe climatic conditions are smaller than farther south, often only 5 m tall. They can tolerate a wide range of soil conditions but grow most commonly in swamps, bogs, or muskeg in wet to moist organic soils such as sphagnum peat and <b>woody</b> <b>peat.</b> They are also found on mineral soils that range from heavy clay to coarse sand; thus texture does not seem to be limiting. Although tamarack can grow well on calcareous soils, it is not abundant on the limestone areas of eastern Ontario.|$|E

40|$|Northern peatlands {{are a large}} {{source of}} {{atmospheric}} methane (CH 4) and both a source and a sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2). The rate and temporal variability in gas exchanges with peat soils {{is directly related to}} the spatial distribution of these free-phase gases within the peat column. In this paper, we present results from surface and borehole ground-penetrating radar surveys – constrained with direct soil and gas sampling – that compare the spatial distribution of gas accumulations in two raised bogs: one in Wales (UK), the other in Maine (USA). Although the two peatlands have similar average thickness, physical properties of the peat matrix differ, particularly in terms of peat type and degree of humification. We hypothesize that these variations in physical properties are responsible for the differences in gas distribution between the two peatlands characterized by (1) gas content up to 10. 8 % associated with <b>woody</b> <b>peat</b> and presence of wood layers in Caribou Bog (Maine) and (2) a more homogenous distribution with gas content up to 5. 7 % at the surface (i. e. < 0. 5 [*]m deep) in Cors Fochno (Wales). Our results highlight the variability in biogenic gas accumulation and distribution across peatlands and suggest that the nature of the peat matrix has a key role in defining how biogenic gas accumulates within and is released to the atmosphere from peat soils. © 2015 The Authors.

40|$|Petrographic and {{chemical}} variability in two tropical, low ash, domed peat deposits of similar age and physiographic setting, but different external morphology, were examined as modern analogues for coal. Both occur in microtidal alluvial to deltaic plain settings, support similar arborescent vegetation and have accumulated {{in the past}} 5, 000 years. One deposit is an extremely convex, mature done, with a surface that rises 10 m above river level; {{the other is a}} low-gradient dome, rising only 3 m above river level but with a concave base up to 6 m below. Both deposits have been eroded by adjacent rivers, yet peat in the mature dome has accumulated remote from persistent flooding and exhibits distinctive internal stratigraphy. Decomposed sapric peat floors the deposits and is overlain by increasingly better preserved woody hemic and a cap of coarse fibrous peat derived from less arborescent vegetation. Consistent flooding in the low-gradient dome has maintained conditions for the accumulation of predominantly <b>woody</b> hemic <b>peat,</b> which interfingers with and is overlain by oxidised sapric peat and levee-derived clastic sediments. Peat types in both deposits exhibit distinctive polymodal textures and organo-chemical signatures that correspond to botanical input and degree of decay. Due to the abundance of pre-huminite/vitrinite macerals in all peat types from these deposits, megascopic and microscopic texture is a better discriminator for comparison to ancient coal types. It is suggested that the upward vertical sequence of decreasing woodiness and increasing lightness in colour observed in the mature dome might best be compared to sequences observed in Tertiary brown coals. This ‘typical’ sequence can be modified or overprinted due to flooding in the burial process...|$|R
40|$|The Soma Basin hosts three coal seams (kM 2, kM 3 and kP 1) {{and several}} altered tuff layers within the Miocene sequences. This study {{focuses on the}} {{determination}} of coal petrography, Rock-Eval pyrolysis, mineralogy and elemental contents of the three coal seams from Eynez, Işıklar and Deniş sectors in the basin, and to identify the mineralogy of altered tuff layers within kM 2 and kP 1 seams. The routine coal quality analyses show that coal samples from the kM 2 seam are characterized by lower ash yields and total S contents, and higher gross calorific values than kM 3 and kP 1 seams. The mineralogical composition of the bulk coal samples from the kM 2 seam is made up mainly of quartz, clay minerals and lesser amounts of feldspars and carbonates. In the kM 3 and {{as well as in}} the lower part of kP 1 seam carbonate minerals are being dominant phases due to the existences of fossil shell-bearing bands in the coal beds and intercalations. The statistical data implies that major elements in bulk coal samples, such as Al, Fe, K, Mg and Na, and the vast majority of minor and trace elements, as we expected, have inorganic affinity. The trace element contents and elemental enrichments are generally changeable from seam to seam; nevertheless, Cs, Li and U are commonly enriched in all studied coal seams. These could be related to the differences ion ash yields and mineralogical compositions of coal beds within the seams. The mineralogical compositions of the altered tuff layers identified within the kM 2 and kP 1 seams display similar compositions with tonsteins; therefore, these layers are presumably in air-fall ash that were originated from synchronous felsic volcanic activities around the basin. The existences of volcanic layers also have has some influences on the mineralogical and elemental composition of both seams. The SEM data shows that clay minerals originated from these layers and certain trace elements (e. g. As and Zr) are 2 enriched in the coal layers below the tuff layers in the kM 2 seam. This might be related to penetration of leached pore waters into these layers and precipitation of epigenetic minerals. The coal petrography data and coal facies diagram show that precursor peat of the kM 2 seam was accumulating under telmatic, mesotrophic anoxic conditions where the water level was high and stable. The relatively low ash yields and thicker coal beds suggest the a lower clastic input ratio from the margins; therefore, the aluminosilicate affiliated elements display lower concentrations in this seam. Following periods when the, water-table fluctuated several times and covered entire mire surface; thus, peat formation ceased and several clastic and calcareous intercalations were deposited in the kM 3 and kP 1 seams. These imply the development of limno-telmatic conditions where fluvial influences took places during peat accumulation of both seams. Therefore, clastic inputs from the margins were high which resulted in elevated the concentrations of aluminosilicate affiliated elements. Furthermore, the mineralogical compositions of coal and intercalations of both seams also suggest the development of neutral to alkaline conditions. Considering the maceral compositions along with the thickness of coal, coal seams in the Soma Basin might have and can suggest the indicate oil generation potential; however, the data of pyrolysis analysis data shows that the studied coal seams are mainly gas-prone and only certain coal beds have mixed hydrocarbon generation capacity. Nevertheless, the changes of vegetation and depositional conditions also have reflections on the HI values. The slightly higher HI and TOC in the kM 2 seems to be related to high contribution of <b>woody</b> material in <b>peat</b> and the development of more acidic conditions, whereas the predominance of herbaceous plant and alkaline conditions in the kM 3 and kP 1 seams resulted in relative low HI and TOC values. All data presented in this study indicates that lithological features, differences in coal qualities and elemental contents in the Soma Basin were mainly controlled by changes ion the depositional conditions and as well as detrital inputs during Miocene...|$|R
40|$|This report {{provides}} {{a record of}} a field excursion to the Shetland Islands in May 2014 to investigate sediments deposited from tsunamis generated from submarine landslides mainly located {{off the coast of}} Norway. The research was funded under a NERC Consortium Grant for a project entitled ‘Will climate change in the Arctic increase the landslide-tsunami risk to the UK?’ It was part of Work Block 2 (WB 2) : ‘What is the timing of tsunami deposits on the UK coastline, and how is it related to the age of major Arctic slides’? The best known and most studied tsunami from the Norwegian submarine landslides is the Storegga event dated at 8, 200 BP. Sediments deposited from this tsunami are commonly found along the west coast of Norway, east coast of mainland Scotland, and also on the Shetland and Faeroe islands. However, there are other landslides off of Norway for which no associated tsunami has been identified, which poses the question as to whether these events did not generate a tsunami or whether the evidence for a tsunami has not yet been found. Although evidence for seabed slumping off Norway was first discovered in the 1950 ’s (Holtedahl, 1955, 1971) and the scale and morphology of a massive submarine landslide, subsequently termed Storegga, mapped in the 1970 ’s (Bugge, 1983), it was not until 1985 that an associated tsunami was first proposed (Svendsen, 1985). The first supporting sedimentary evidence of the tsunami was first identified on mainland Scotland in 1988 (Dawson et al., 1988) then, subsequently, similar sediments were identified on the Shetland Islands (Smith, 1993 a). The Storegga Slide has been dated to 8, 150 BP (Haflidason et al., 2005), however more recent research on the deposits on the Shetlands suggests that some may not all be from Storegga, because 14 C age dating gives younger ages of 5, 000 and 1, 500 cal yr BP (Bondevik et al., 2005). A major challenge posed by the ages of these younger dates is that they are confined to the Shetlands; there is no indication of these younger tsunamis on mainland Scotland. If the dating is correct and the sediments are indeed from tsunamis, then the submarine landslides off Norway would be an unlikely source, so a local source seems most likely, but none has yet been identified. Alternatively a non-tsunami source for the sediments may explain their presence. The objectives of WB 2 therefore are to investigate the tsunami deposits on Shetland that post-date the Storegga Slide, to validate their ages and, if possible, identify possible source locations of the submarine landslides that generated the tsunamis. On Shetland research on tsunami sediments was mainly based on evidence from coastal exposures around Sullom Voe where tsunami sands are dated as coeval with Storegga. The younger sands are mainly preserved in lake cores at locations on Shetland Mainland (Bondevik et al., 2005) where those of 5, 000 BP overlie sands of Storegga age at 8, 200 years BP age. At coastal sites along Basta Voe on Yell and at a mainland site at Dury Voe very young age dates of 1, 500 BP suggest an additional and very recent, late Holocene event (Bondevik et al., 2005; Dawson et al, 2006). A preliminary field excursion to the Shetlands carried out in 2013 discovered possible new tsunami deposits preserved in peat on central Yell at Whale Firth, Mid Yell Voe and Kirkabister. Subsequent 14 C age dating of these deposits resulted in a variety of ages, many much younger than that of Storegga. The 14 C method is known to be subject to major uncertainties because of contamination, for example initial age dating in the 1990 ’s at sites around Sullom Voe returned ages of around 5, 000 years BP, although these were subsequently rejected in favour of the earlier, 8, 200 BP Storegga event. Thus, validating the ages of the deposits on Yell, prospectively from a number of deposits laid down successively at one site (thereby reducing the sole reliance on 14 C dating) was critical in validating the presence of more than one tsunami event on Shetland. The objective of the 2014 field visit to the Shetlands, therefore, was to return to Yell and validate the preliminary results from 2013; revisiting the sites at Whale Firth, Mid Yell and Kirkabister and searching the coastlines of Unst, Fetlar, Yell and north Mainland for additional sites where tsunami sediments might be preserved. Just before the visit new 14 C dates from Mid Yell from samples collected in 2013 confirmed the previous results from other locations that had given a wide range of ages; at Whale Firth a single date gave a ‘young’ age of 5, 000 years BP, a range of ages with the oldest at 8, 200 years BP were returned from Mid Yell Voe. We first visited sites on north Mainland around Sullom Voe, as it was here that the first indications of the Storegga tsunami were identified on Shetland in 1992. The deposits are classic as they contain rip-up clasts characteristic of tsunami deposits elsewhere. We then visited the sites at Basta Voe, Whale Firth, Mid Yell and Kirkabister. We carried out reconnaissance surveys on Unst, Fetlar, Yell and north Mainland. Preliminary results: 1. The new evidence supports the presence of tsunami sediments on Yell at Mid Yell Voe and Whale Firth, but the age of these sediments requires further research to confirm previous dating and their possible sources, 2. The youngest dated sediments (1, 500 BP) at Vasta Voe are most likely from a tsunami, but their limited areal extent suggests a local source, as yet undetermined, 3. The presence of three events at Mid Yell Voe based on surveys in 2013 was not confirmed, 4. The similarity of the deposits on Mid Yell with those around Sullom Voe on Mainland are suggestive of a similar source, 5. The wide range of the preliminary age dating at the Mid Yell sites (Whale Firth and Mid Yell Voe) is analogous to the early age dating of coastal deposits around Sullom Voe, suggesting the possibility of contamination of the peat material dated, 6. Whereas the 5, 500 BP event is identified in lake cores, no strongly supportive evidence for sands of this age were identified in the coastal sections, 7. Of the proposed three tsunami events proposed for Shetland only one, Storegga, has a confirmed source, 8. Further analysis of the peat stratigraphy at the coastal sites, reflects vegetation changes over the past 8, 000 years related to climate change, and these could be used to provide a broader context for the 14 C age dating that may resolve the present dating issues, 9. Newly discovered sediments at Kirkabister require further research to determine their origin, 10. The origin(s) of the laminated deposits at Whale Firth, Mid Yell and Vatsetter is/are uncertain, but they are probably not from a tsunami, 11. No additional coastal exposures of peat with tsunami sands were located during the reconnaissance surveys on Mainland, Yell, Unst and Fetlar. Postscript; Immediately after this report was finalised, age dating of peat sections at Whale Firth and Mid Yell Voe confirmed that the sands preserved in the <b>woody</b> <b>peat</b> here are of Storegga age, 8, 200 cal yr BP...|$|E
