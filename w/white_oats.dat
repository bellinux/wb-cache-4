40|$|Samples of some cereals (corn, barley, and oats), whole (W) or {{subjected}} to flaking (F), rolling (R) and extrusion (E) were collected from different horses feed industries. Feed samples were analyzed for their proximate composition and fibrous fractions by Van Soest procedure. The total starch content (TS) was determined directly by liquid chromatography (TS 1) and as sum of resistant and non-resistant starch using a specific enzymatic kit before the spectrophotometric reading (TS 2). In vitro organic matter digestibility (OMD) by pepsin-cellulase technique was also estimated. The content of resistant starch was low in the cereals (on average 2. 0 % of the total starch), except for the whole corn samples. TS 1 values were lower than TS 2, particularly at lower starch levels. The in vitro OMD values ranged from 66. 8 % (whole <b>white</b> <b>oats)</b> to 95. 7 % (flaked corn). The effects of the physical treatments on the in vitro OMD were variable among cereals. The in vitro OMD of flaked <b>white</b> <b>oats</b> was lower with respect to whole and rolled grain. In corn and barley samples the physical treatments did not change the in vitro OMD values. Using the step-wise multiple regression method for all the chemical parameters, in vitro OMD of the cereals could be predicted by ADF content (R- 2 = 0. 986; RSD= +/- 1. 2 %). Other parameters (CP, lipids, lignin and total starch) gave little improvement in predicting in vitro OMD when included in the model. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} in the years 2007 - 2008, after 6 -year-long experiments in the cultivation of spring barley in a crop rotation system and in monoculture. The other experimental factor was the spring barley protection method. Intensive protection involved comprehensive treatment of barley (in-crop harrowing, seed dressing, application of herbicides, fungicides, a retardant and an insecticide). Extensive protection consisted only in in-crop harrowing, without the application of crop protection agents, except for seed dressing. The above mentioned factors formed the background for the study on the cultivation of <b>white</b> mustard and <b>oats,</b> as phytosanitary species, in successive years. In the test plants, no mineral fertilization and crop protection were applied. Such agricultural method enabled an objective assessment of the consequent effect of monoculture, crop rotation and crop treatments. A hypothesis was made that the cultivation of the phytosanitary plants in the stand after 6 -year-long barley monoculture would allow obtaining the level of yields and weed infestation {{similar to those of the}} crop rotation treatments. It was also assumed that the cultivation of <b>white</b> mustard and <b>oats</b> would eliminate differences in plant productivity caused by the negative influence of extensive protection. It was proved that the cultivation of the phytosanitary plants eliminated the negative influence of monoculture on the level of their yields and weed infestation. However, the test plants did not compensate negative consequences of extensive protection. In spite of this, <b>white</b> mustard and <b>oats</b> effectively competed with weeds, and the number and weight of weeds in a crop canopy did not cause a dramatic decline in yields.

Dehydration curves were studied under a randomized block design with a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement using split plots in time, considering two types of oats (white and black), two cutting heights (10 and 20 cm), and 17 sampling times (0, 4, 19, 24, 28, 43, 47, 52, 67, 71, 76, 91, 95, 100, 115, 129, and 124 hours after harvesting) with five replicates. For the chemical composition and occurrence of fungi, the experimental design comprised randomized blocks in a factorial 2 × 2 split-plot in time with two types of oats, two cutting heights, and three assessment periods: before cutting, during baling, and after 30 days of storage, with five replicates. The hay obtained by cutting of the black and <b>white</b> <b>oats</b> at heights of 10 and 20 cm showed similar dehydration curves. The crude protein values were higher in <b>white</b> <b>oats</b> only at the time of cutting (141. 5 g/kg). The black oats showed lower nutritional quality, with higher levels of ADF and lignin. There was no effect of cutting height on the chemical composition, but the cutting height interfered with the production of dry matter and residue after cutting, with cutting at 10 cm leading to higher dry matter production and at 20 cm to increased waste production. The cutting heights of the oats interfere directly with the dry matter production and post-harvest residue without changing the chemical composition of the hay...|$|E

Growth rate and final biomass of cover crop species decreased with delayed planting, except for radish. February planted cover crops had the lowest residues remaining at maize planting, resulting in higher weed dry weights at 3 and 6 weeks after planting (WAP). April planted cover crops improved soil N by a greater margin compared to earlier plantings, which were comparable within their category. Grazing vetch and radish resulted in the greatest soil N improvement. Significantly higher (P< 0. 05) maize grain yield was recorded in grazing vetch, while all other species had comparable yields.

40|$|Achieving high biomass {{yields of}} cover crops {{has been a}} {{challenge}} to the success of Conservation Agriculture (CA) practices in the Eastern Cape (EC). A study was conducted to evaluate strategies for optimizing cover crop biomass production. Trials were carried out to screen summer and winter cover crops, as well as evaluate intercropping patterns and planting dates for biomass, weed suppression and subsequent maize yield under irrigation. Four summer legume cover crop species were evaluated under a Randomised Complete Block Design (RCBD) design. The cover crops were fertilized with 13. 34 kg ha- 1 of N, 20 kg ha- 1 P and 26. 66 kg ha- 1 K. In the 2008 / 09 summer season a maize crop was superimposed on the 2007 / 08 screening trial under no-till. The crop was fertilized with 60 kg ha- 1 of N. An intercropping trial was conducted over two seasons as a way of investigating the best way of incorporating cover crops into farmers cropping systems. This was done bearing in mind the limitation of resources such as land. The trial evaluated 3 factors laid as a 2 x 2 x 3 factorial arranged in a split-plot design. The main factor was cover crop planting date (planting at maize planting or 2 weeks after maize planting). The sub plot factor was intercropping pattern (strip intercropping and between row intercropping). A trial was also conducted to evaluate the effect of planting date (End of April and mid May) and four winter legume cover crop species on cover crop biomass, weed suppression and maize grain yield. The experiment was laid out as a Randomised Complete Block Design (RCBD) replicated 3 times. In the subsequent summer season a maize crop was superimposed on the winter trial to test the residual effects of the cover crop species. Another study was conducted to evaluate winter cereal cover crop species for biomass accumulation, weed suppression and subsequent maize grain yield. The cover crops as well as a weedy fallow control plot treatments were laid out as a Randomised Complete Block Design replicated 3 times. In the subsequent summer season a maize crop was superimposed on the site under no-till to evaluate the residual effect of the cover crops on maize. The results showed sunhemp, cowpea and lablab as the best cover crops with high biomass and weed suppression whilst mucuna was the least. Sunhemp consistently yielded higher cover biomass averaging 11200 kg ha- 1 over the two seasons whilst mucuna had a consistently lowest average biomass yield of 4050 kg ha- 1. These cover crops were above the critical 6 t ha- 1 for effective weed suppression. There was a significant (p< 0. 01) relationship of cover crop dry weight and weed dry weight in both seasons. Subsequent maize grain yield was significantly higher in the sunhemp plots (64. 2 %) than the weedy fallow plot. Mucuna, lablab and cowpea had maize grain yield increases of 16. 6 %, 33 % and 43. 2 % respectively. Intercropping cover crops at maize planting yielded higher cover crop dry weights than a delay in intercropping cover crops. A delay in intercropping resulted in significantly higher average maize grain yield of 4700 kg ha- 1 compared to intercropping at maize planting (3800 kg ha- 1) and sole maize (4300 kg ha- 1) over the two seasons. Strip intercropping also yielded higher (5000 kg ha- 1) average maize grain yield compared to row intercropping (3600 kg ha- 1) and sole maize (4300 kg ha- 1). There was a significant (p< 0. 05) relationship between cover crop dry weight in the 2007 / 08 season and maize grain yield in the 2008 / 09 season. Early planting grazing vetch gave the highest biomass yield of 8100 kg ha- 1 whilst early planted red clover had the lowest biomass of 635 kg ha- 1. Low weed dry weights were also obtained from the early planted grazing vetch as opposed to the other treatments. There was a significant (p< 0. 001) relationship of cover crop dry weight and weed dry weight. In the subsequent 2008 / 09 summer season early planted grazing vetch had the highest maize yield of 7500 kg ha- 1 which was 56. 3 % more than the weedy fallow plot had 4800 kg ha- 1. The weedy fallow plot also had high weed infestation than the cover crop plots. There were significant (p< 0. 01) relationships between cover crop dry weight and maize grain yield, winter weed dry weight and maize grain yield and summer weed dry weight and maize grain yield. The results also showed triticale (13900 kg ha- 1) as the best winter cover crop for biomass production. Italian ryegrass (6500 kg ha- 1) produced the least amount of biomass. In The subsequent maize crop <b>white</b> <b>oats</b> gave highest maize grain yield (6369 kg ha- 1) which was 33 % more than the weedy fallow plot (4784 kg ha- 1). There were also significant (p< 0. 01) relationships of maize grain yield and winter weed dry weight, maize grain yield and summer growing weeds. The various studies demonstrated that there is opportunity for high biomass production under small scale farmers irrigated conditions using cover crops both in winter and summer. Best bet cover crops were sunhemp, cowpea and lablab for summer and triticale, <b>white</b> <b>oats,</b> barley, Italian ryegrass and grazing vetch for winter. Cover crops can also be incorporated into farmers cropping systems as sole crops or intercrops within the maize based cropping systems.
