25|$|In 1980, the 2.25-litre petrol {{and diesel}} engines {{received}} five main bearing crankshafts to increase rigidity and the transmission, axles and <b>wheel</b> <b>hubs</b> were strengthened. This {{was the culmination of}} a series of updates to the transmission that had been made since the 1960s to combat the all-too-common problem of the rear axle half-shafts breaking in heavy usage. This problem was partly due to the design of the shafts themselves. Due to the fully floating design of the rear <b>wheel</b> <b>hubs,</b> the half shafts can be removed very quickly without even having to jack the vehicle off the ground. The tendency for commercial operators to overload their vehicles exacerbated this flaw which blighted the Series Land Rovers in many of their export markets and established a reputation that continues in many markets to the present day. This is despite the 1982 re-design (mainly the increase of driving-splines from 10 to 24 to reduce stress) that all but solved the problem.|$|E
25|$|The {{front axle}} was drop forged {{as a single}} piece of {{vanadium}} steel. Ford twisted many axles through eight full rotations (2880 degrees) and sent them to dealers to be put on display to demonstrate its superiority. The Model T did not have a modern service brake. The right foot pedal applied a band around a drum in the transmission, thus stopping the rear wheels from turning. The previously mentioned parking brake lever operated band brakes acting {{on the inside of the}} rear brake drums, which were an integral part of the rear <b>wheel</b> <b>hubs.</b> Optional brakes that acted on the outside of the brake drums were available from aftermarket suppliers.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, Gordon won {{his first}} Cup Series championship. Despite a rough start to the season in the Daytona 500, he won three of the {{following}} six races at Rockingham, Atlanta and Bristol, while winning the pole at Rockingham, Richmond, Darlington and North Wilkesboro in that timespan. He won his fifth pole of the season at Charlotte, but after the race, NASCAR officials found unapproved <b>wheel</b> <b>hubs</b> on his car, and fined the team $60,000 while placing Ray Evernham on probation indefinitely. Gordon later won four more poles during the season (Dover, Michigan, Indianapolis, Martinsville) while winning races at Daytona, New Hampshire, Darlington and Dover. The results during the season gave him a 300-point lead over Dale Earnhardt {{en route to the}} title. The team's consistency was much better as well, having had three DNF's in 1995, compared to 21 in his previous two seasons combined.|$|E

25|$|Some components, {{which are}} often {{optional}} accessories on sports bicycles, are standard features on utility bicycles to enhance their usefulness, comfort, safety and visibility. Mudguards, or fenders, protect the cyclist and moving parts from spray when riding through wet areas and chainguards protect clothes from oil on the chain while preventing clothing from being caught between the chain and crankset teeth. Kick stands keep bicycles upright when parked, and bike locks deter theft. Front-mounted baskets, front or rear luggage carriers or racks, and panniers mounted above either or both wheels {{can be used to}} carry equipment or cargo. Pegs can be fastened to one, or both of the <b>wheel</b> <b>hubs</b> to either help the rider perform certain tricks, or allow a place for extra riders to stand, or rest. Parents sometimes add rear-mounted child seats, an auxiliary saddle fitted to the crossbar, or both to transport children. Training wheels are sometimes used when learning to ride.|$|E
500|$|The suspension, which {{controls}} the relative {{motion of the}} chassis and the wheels, {{is similar to that}} of the BT48: it features double wishbones front and rear, with the springs and dampers mounted on the chassis out of the airflow and activated by pullrods. Anti-roll bars are fitted front and rear. The BT49's disc brakes are mounted outboard, within the <b>wheel</b> <b>hubs,</b> and are activated by a single four piston brake caliper for each wheel. For most of the BT49's career, it used conventional steel brakes. Lighter reinforced carbon-carbon discs and pads, a technology that Brabham had introduced to Formula One in 1976, were used in 1981 and 1982; The wheels are of [...] diameter, although occasionally [...] wheels were used at the front. The car initially raced on Goodyear tyres, but the team had to adapt the BT49 to Michelin's new radial tyres for part of the 1981 season when Goodyear temporarily withdrew from Formula One. Slick tyres were used in dry conditions and treaded tyres in the wet.|$|E
2500|$|The wood of Nyssa sylvatica is heavy, hard, cross-grained, and {{difficult}} to split, especially after drying. This resistance to splitting led to its use for making mauls, pulleys, <b>wheel</b> <b>hubs,</b> agricultural rollers, bowls, and paving blocks. [...] The wood is also used for pallets, rough floors, pulpwood, and firewood. Since the wood is very tough, resistant to wear, {{it has been used}} for shuttles in weaving.|$|E
50|$|Eventually {{the growth}} in power of the {{gasoline}} engine overtook {{the power of the}} electric <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> motors and this made up for any losses through a transmission.

2500|$|Elm wood {{is valued}} for its {{interlocking}} grain, and consequent resistance to splitting, with significant uses in wagon <b>wheel</b> <b>hubs,</b> chair seats and coffins. The bodies of Japanese Taiko drums are often {{cut from the}} wood of old elm trees, as the wood's resistance to splitting is highly desired for nailing the skins to them, {{and a set of}} three or more is often cut from the same tree. The elm's wood bends well and distorts easily making it quite pliant. [...] The often long, straight, trunks were favoured as a source of timber for keels in ship construction. Elm is also prized by bowyers; of the ancient bows found in Europe, a large portion of them are elm. During the Middle Ages elm was also used to make longbows if yew was unavailable.|$|E

2500|$|The ACR Neon, {{available}} with the DOHC engine, featured four-wheel disc brakes, Arvin non-adjustable struts for 1995–1996 models and Koni adjustable dampers for 1997–1999 models, thicker anti-sway bars, stiffer suspension bushings, fast-ratio steering, heavy-duty <b>wheel</b> <b>hubs,</b> and a five-speed manual transmission with a shorter [...]81 fifth gear and {{final drive ratio}} of 3.94 for quicker acceleration. 1995 through 1997 models featured adjustable camber. The computer-controlled speed limiter was removed from 1995 ACR models (limited to [...] on later models), and ABS was also, to save weight. The ACR offers no badging to distinguish it from other Neon models; the only visible differences are a bumper with fog light holes, but no fog lights {{and a lack of}} side moldings. For 1995, the ACR was only offered to SCCA members, but in subsequent years it was available to the general public. The name [...] "ACR" [...] was initially the internal ordering code for the [...] "Competition Package", as it was termed in dealer materials; however, as knowledge of the model spread, the ACR name stuck. The backronym [...] "American Club Racer" [...] was coined due to its popularity with club and grassroots racers. To save weight, both the standard A/M-F/M radio with cassette player and air conditioning could be deleted, both for credit.|$|E

40|$|The {{failure of}} the left <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> {{assembly}} was due to fatigue cracking of the rear half hub.

Evidences suggest that abnormal forces acted on the outboard surface of the <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> resulting in pulling apart of the two hubs. The most probable reason for the generation of such forces appears to be either due to heavy landing or inadequate tyre pressure. This had resulted in digging of the axle flange into the <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> with subsequent fatigue crack initiation at these locations.
