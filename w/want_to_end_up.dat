[...] The flashforwards were written partially to explain what led Jack to become the drug addict {{that he is in}} third-season finale's flashforwards, who believes that his father is alive. [...] Matthew Fox stated that the fourth season is [...] "starting to close the loop on the end of [...] season. [...] Jack in the future is a man marked by weakness, but the Jack [...] is strong. [...] how he made that transition." [...] When asked why Hurley does not take drugs to see Charlie, but Jack starts his drug addiction to try not to see Christian, Edward Kitsis said that [...] "Jack has … always been a man of science, and there has to be something logical.

[...] There's so much devotion to that child, and she appears to be such a great mother … taking care of Aaron may have helped her put away some other issues." ...|$|E

[...] According to Turkish authorities, investigations into the smuggling operations in Turkey showed that refugees were often tasked with helping smugglers sign up passengers for smuggling trips. It was also not uncommon for one of the passengers to be given the responsibility of driving the boat. No smuggler, with family in Turkey and a steady income from the lucrative smuggling trade, would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> illegally in Europe and risk not being able to return home, where he would be likely to face arrest anyway.

5000|$|One of {{the main}} ideas in CFEngine is that changes in {{computer}} configuration should be carried out in a convergent manner. This means that each change operation made by the agent should have {{the character of a}} fixed point. Rather than describing the steps needed to make a change, CFEngine language describes the final state in which one <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>up.</b> The agent then ensures that the necessary steps are taken <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> in this [...] "policy compliant state". Thus, CFEngine can be run again and again, whatever the initial state of a system, and it will <b>end</b> <b>up</b> with a predictable result. CFEngine supports the item of statistical compliance with policy, meaning that a system can never guarantee to be exactly in an ideal or desired state, rather one approaches (converges) towards the desired state by best-effort, at a rate that is determined by the ratio of the frequency of environmental change to the rate of CFEngine execution.|$|R
