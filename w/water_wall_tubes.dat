50|$|The four 500 MW boilers at Cottam Power Station are {{manufactured}} by John Thompson Water Tube Boilers Limited, {{in conjunction with}} Clarke Chapman & Co. Ltd. Each has an evaporation rate at M.C.R. of 1.542 tonne/hour (3,400 lb/hr). The boiler plant has been designed for short time overload operation. By by-passing two of the H.P. feed heaters and increasing the firing rate by 8% an increase of 5% electrical output can be obtained. Coal is fed from the bunker to the fuel pulverising mills by variable speed drag-link feeders. The four barrel type mills rotated at 15 rev/min (94.25 Rad/min), and are swept by hot air which carries the P.F. mixture to eight classifiers that reject any unground pieces of coal back to the mill. Eight exhausters pass the P.F. to 32 turbulent P.F. burners arranged in four rows of eight burners on the boiler front. Each P.F. burner has an integral oil burner which is used for lighting up purposes and low load operation when instability with P.F. firing would be experienced. Combustion air is fed to the burners by two forced draught fans which pass warm air ducted {{from the top of}} the boiler house through two rotary regenerative air heaters to the secondary, or combustion air registers around each burner. The air heaters are so designed that they can be by-passed on the gas and air side to facilitate optimum operating conditions. The boiler feed water which is passed through the economiser before entering the drum is circulated around the combustion chamber <b>water</b> <b>wall</b> <b>tubes</b> by any three of the four boiler water circulating pumps. Steam from the drum is passed to the H.P. turbine through a horizontal primary super heater bank, pendant super heater platens, and pendant final super heater bank. The super heater platens which are situated directly above the combustion chamber differ from other heaters in that the heat is imparted to the steam by radiation as well as convection. The other heaters being later in the gas duct rely mainly on convection for heat transfer. Steam temperature control is achieved by two stages of attemperation, one of which s between the primary super heater and the super heater platens and the other, which controls the final steam temperature, is immediately before the final super heater inlet. Exhaust steam from the H.P. turbine is returned to the boiler for re-heating at a constant pressure before being returned to the I.P. turbine. This achieved by a horizontal primary and a pendant final re-heater situated in the gas duct. Steam temperature control is achieved by non-contact type attemperators. The boiler is kept clean by 42 gun type soot blowers in the combustion chamber and 42 long retractable blowers which clean the pendant and convection surfaces, all operating under automatic control from the control room. The hot gasses from the combustion chamber are drawn through the super heater and re-heater banks, air heater and precipitators by induced draught fans which expel the gasses through the F.G.D. to the chimney. The fans maintain a slight vacuum within the combustion chamber in order to prevent combustion gasses leaking into the boiler house. The precipitators which are entirely of steel construction collect the dust by electrostatic means and there are no mechanical collectors.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Boiler is {{a device}} used for {{generating}} the steam for power generation, process use or heating, and {{hot water for}} heating purposes. Steam boiler consists of the containing vessel and convection heating surfaces only, whereas a steam generator covers the whole unit, encompassing <b>water</b> <b>wall</b> <b>tubes,</b> super heaters, air heaters and economizers. The selection of the boiler {{is very important to}} the industry for conducting the operation system successfully. The selection criteria are based on rule based expert system and multi-criteria weighted average method. The developed system consists of Knowledge Acquisition Module, Boiler Selection Module, User Interface Module and Help Module.

The erosion wastage at high {{temperature of the}} coating was researched with different impingement angles and temperatures. The results indicated that impingement angle and temperature greatly affected erosion wastage of the coating. At the same time, when impingement angle was 90 °, different temperature had a {{little effect on the}} erosion wastage. And when temperature was 650 °C, different impingement angle had a little effect on the erosion wastage too. As compared with <b>water</b> <b>wall</b> <b>tube</b> material (G 20 steel) of power station boiler, the erosion resistance at high temperature of the coating was higher. The erosion resistance rate of the coating was 1. 94 ~ 2. 89 times of that of G 20 steel when temperature was 650 °C and particle was polygonal silica.

40|$|Purpose: of {{this paper}} is to reveal the {{mechanisms}} of corrosion processes of outer surfaces of low-emission steam boiler evaporator tubes. Examinations were performed to find the reasons of different corrosion susceptibility of tubes situated at combustion chamber on various levels. Design/methodology/approach: Examinations were conducted on several segments of Ø 57 x 5. 0 mm evaporator tubes made of 16 M (16 Mo 3) steel grade. Segments were taken from level of 10 meters and 18 meters from the chamber bottom of low-emission coal fired steam boiler after two years operation. Microstructure degradation of base material was estimated. Metallographic evaluation of scale morphology, its micro sites chemical composition analysis and distribution of elements on cross sections have been performed. Findings: Eexaminations of evaporator tubes indicated that reduction of wall thickness was considerable at the segments taken from level of 10 m, when at level of 18 m this reduction was small. The morphology of scales consisted of external layer which was porous and weakly connected to the tube surface, and internal layer, which was dense and adherent to the base metal. In these two layers the bands reach in sulfur were detected. The sulfide corrosion seems to be the main degradation mechanism of the tube surface at the level of 10 m. Research limitations/implications: Corrosion of the <b>water</b> <b>wall</b> <b>tubes</b> in low-emission steam boilers is a result of reaction of steel tube surface with the aggressive substoichiometric environment contains sulfur. The chemical composition of flue gases changes along the water wall. The exact compound of flue gases has not been determined in this study. Practical implications: Prevention of <b>water</b> <b>wall</b> <b>tubes</b> corrosion can be achieved by changing in operation conditions or replacement of tube materials. The first mentioned action is limited to accurate burner’s adjustment or introduces a flow of additional air along the walls and create air curtain between reducing environment and tubes surface. These efforts often are insufficient. The replacement of more corrosion resistant material on Cr rich steel or Cr-Ni steel is possible but other problems appear connected with high costs of installation and low heat transfer coefficients of such materials. Knowing the mechanisms of corrosion allows adjusting combustion process at low emission steam boilers. Originality/value: Information available in literature does not clearly indicate what mechanism of corrosion is dominant at different parts of combustion chamber. The current study shows which corrosion mechanisms are the most dangerous for evaporator tubes...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a {{two stage}} acid etching (TSAE) {{technique}} {{has been developed}} and investigated to clean-up hard deposits on internal surfaces of boiler <b>water</b> <b>wall</b> <b>tubes</b> (WWTs) for a natural circulation high-pressure drum boiler(fossil) unit: TIME- 206 -COB (Russia) at Ghorasal Thermal Power Station(GTPS), Bangladesh.

40|$|The {{dominant}} role of electricity generation and environment consideration have placed strong requirements on coal fired power plants, {{requiring them to}} improve boiler combustion efficiency and decrease carbon emission. Although neural network based optimization strategies are often applied to improve the coal fired power plant boiler efficiency, they are limited by some combustion related problems such as slagging. Slagging can seriously influence heat transfer rate and decrease the boiler efficiency. In addition, {{it is difficult to}} measure slag build-up. The lack of measurement for slagging can restrict conventional neural network based coal fired boiler optimization, because no data can be used to train the neural network. This paper proposes a novel method of integrating non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA II) based multi-objective optimization with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to decrease or even avoid slagging inside a coal fired boiler furnace and improve boiler combustion efficiency. Compared with conventional neural network based boiler optimization methods, the method developed in the work can control and optimize the fields of flue gas properties such as temperature field inside a boiler by adjusting the temperature and velocity of primary and secondary air in coal fired power plant boiler control systems. The temperature in the vicinity of <b>water</b> <b>wall</b> <b>tubes</b> of a boiler can be maintained within the ash melting temperature limit. The incoming ash particles cannot melt and bond to surface of heat transfer equipment of a boiler. So the trend of slagging inside furnace is controlled. Furthermore, the optimized boiler combustion can keep higher heat transfer efficiency than that of the non-optimized boiler combustion. The software is developed to realize the proposed method and obtain the encouraging results through combining ANSYS 14. 5, ANSYS Fluent 14. 5 and CORBA C++...|$|E
25|$|The Thornycroft boiler is {{a variant}} that splits the usual central furnace into two. There are four drums: two main drums {{vertically}} in the centre – a steam and a water drum – also two wing drums {{at the outside}} edges of the furnace. The design was notable for its early use of the water-wall furnace. The outer bank of tubes was shallow, consisting of only two rows of tubes. These rows were spaced closely, so that the tubes formed a solid wall, without gasflow between them. The inner bank of tubes was similar: the two rows of tubes closest to the furnace formed a similar <b>water</b> <b>wall.</b> These <b>tubes</b> were splayed apart at their base, so as to provide space for gasflow between them. Within the tube bank, gas flow is mostly parallel to the tubes, similar to some early designs, but contrary to the crossflow design of later three-drum boilers. The exhaust gas emerged into the heart-shaped space below the upper central drum, exiting to the funnel through the rear wall.|$|R

40|$|In EfW (Energy from Waste) boilers, flue gases {{can create}} {{corrosion}} of the superheaters and economisers, caused by deposits of the melted ashes. Due to this, the flue gases are cooled with <b>water</b> <b>wall</b> panels and <b>water</b> <b>tube</b> <b>walls</b> in a cooling pass {{before reaching the}} heat transfer surfaces, thus limiting the power output. One way {{to increase the efficiency}} of the boiler is to introduce superheater screens in the cooling zone instead of using <b>water</b> <b>wall</b> panels to cool the flue gases. This new superheater would be covered in a ceramic material to protect its tubes from the above-cited fouling. The purpose of the present work was to create a 1 D model that describes the heat transfer from the flue gases to the coolant (steam and water) in the flue gas cooling pass of a power boiler. The 1 D model, which is validated against CFD simulations using the Discrete Ordinates (DO) radiation model, will be used in the retrofit of EfW boilers. Furthermore, CFD simulations are used to study the pressure loss and mass flow distribution in the cooling pass under different situations and to provide design correlations. Also, the influence of different parameters on the computational cost of the CFD simulations is examined. The 1 D model agreed fairly well with the CFD simulation, especially in {{the lower part of the}} cooling pass. The flue gas outlet temperature was 4. 5 % lower in the 1 D model than in the CFD simulation. In the 1 D model, the geometry could be approached as rectangular canals, neglecting the inclination of the ceiling, and modelling the inlet and the outlet of the cooling pass as <b>water</b> <b>tube</b> <b>walls.</b> Regarding the flow field, the mass flow distribution in the cooling pass was found to be independent of factors such as the mass flow rate and the number of screens. It is sufficient to calculate the relative depths of the canals to get the mass flow distribution. The pressure loss can be found as a function of the average flue gas velocity in the cooling pass. The CFD mesh required approximately half a million cells, and the computational cost was decreased by using a symmetry plane in the middle of the cooling pass, costing just over an hour...|$|R

Large {{amount of the}} energy loss in Rankine cycle steam turbines (ST) {{is due to the}} temperature difference between the combustion flame temperature 2250 K (adiabatic) and the high pressure steam temperature up to 900 K. However, some of this energy can be harvested using solid-state thermoelectric (TE) power generators which are placed into the gap between the flame temperature and the steam temperature that produce additional elec-trical power. This study investigates the potential placement of TE on <b>water</b> <b>tube</b> <b>wall</b> inside a boiler at a coal-fired power plant. Three-dimensional (3 D) numerical model of a simplified TE module is developed, and hot gas temperature and steam temperature from the boiler are used as boundary conditions at the hot side and cold side of the TE.

First, a mathematical model of fouling resistance in tubular heat exchangers is adapted. The model is based on the applied thermal power, the inside heat transfer coefficient, and geometrical characteristics of the heat exchanger under consideration. The resulting model is a function of measured quantities such as <b>water</b> and <b>tube</b> <b>wall</b> temperatures, fluid flow velocity, and some physical properties of the fluid flowing inside the tubes, such as viscosity, conductivity, and density. Second, an on-line fouling monitoring system was prepared, and the heat transfer resistance for selected solutions was measured in real time by this system. The effect of concentration and chemical reactions on fouling was studied experimentally using contaminants such as sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride, calcium chloride, and a mixture of sodium bicarbonate and calcium chloride. Experimental results provide quantitative information of liquid-side fouling on heat transfer surfaces, and its effects on the thermal efficiency. Experimental data are critical for heat exchanger design and for planning operating and cleaning schedules of the heat exchanger.
