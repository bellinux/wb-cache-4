40|$|M. Phil. In today's {{world with}} its {{competitive}} environment {{there is a}} need to shorten product development time by using CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) to design an object for example a car, aeroplane or missile and to predict the forces that the wind will have on the object (design). To evaluate the correctness of the CFD results, the design or a scale model of the design must be tested in a wind tunnel by using a force balance. The <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>balance</b> is an apparatus used in the designing and testing of wings, shapes and profiles. In general a balance can be used in all aerodynamic designs to determine the forces on an object when it is moving through air. The aim of this project was to design and manufacture a three-component external balance for a low-speed wind tunnel using an axiomatic design method. It also covers the installation of the external <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>balance</b> to a wind tunnel with a computerized data acquisition capturing system, and performance evaluation of the <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>balance...</b>|$|E

40|$|This effort {{examined}} {{the potential of}} multi-winglets for the reduction of induced drag without increasing the span of aircraft wings. <b>Wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> models were constructed using a NACA 0012 airfoil section for the untwisted, rectangular wing and flat plates for the winglets. Testing of the configurations occurred over a range of Reynolds numbers from 161, 000 to 300, 000. <b>Wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>balances</b> provided lift and drag measurements, and laser flow visualization obtained wingtip vortex information.

A substantial increase in lift curve slope occurs with dihedral spread of winglets set at zero incidence relative to the wing. Dihedral spread also distributes the tip vortex.

40|$|The {{changes in}} {{stability}} and control characteristics encountered by a thrust reversing aircraft during its final approach, landing, and ground roll are described. These changes include a strong pitch-up {{accompanied by the}} loss of horizontal tail and aileron control effectiveness. The magnitude of reverser induced changes in ground effect are much larger than corresponding changes in free air. Some unexpected unsteady motions exhibited in wind tunnel by an aircraft model with reversers operating in ground proximity are also described. The cause of this oscillatory behavior was determined to be an unsteady interaction between the wall jets formed by impingement of reverser jets on the ground and the on-coming free stream. Time histories of rolling moments measured by the <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>balance</b> or support system were removed and frequencies were scaled by Strouhal number to full scale.

40|$|This {{research}} paper investigates current experimental designs and regression models for calibrating internal <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> force <b>balances</b> of non-monolithic design. Such calibration methods {{are necessary for}} this class of balance because it has an electrical response that is dependent upon {{the sign of the}} applied forces and moments.

40|$|Independent {{calibration}} {{variables for}} {{the characterization of}} semispan and canard <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>balances</b> are discussed. It is shown that the variable selection for a semispan balance {{is determined by the}} location of the resultant normal and axial forces that act on the balance. These two forces are the first and second calibration variable. The pitching moment becomes the third calibration variable after the normal and axial forces are shifted to the pitch axis of the balance. Two geometric distances, i. e., the rolling and yawing moment arms, are the fourth and fifth calibration variable. They are traditionally substituted by corresponding moments to simplify the use of calibration data during a <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> test. A canard balance is related to a semispan balance. It also only measures loads on one half of a lifting surface. However, the axial force and yawing moment are of no interest to users of a canard balance. Therefore, its calibration variable set is reduced to the normal force, pitching moment, and rolling moment. The combined load diagrams of the rolling and yawing moment for a semispan balance are discussed. They may be used to illustrate connections between the <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> model geometry, the test section size, and the calibration load schedule. Then, methods are reviewed that may be used to obtain the natural zeros of a semispan or canard balance. In addition, characteristics of three semispan balance calibration rigs are discussed.

40|$|Miniflaps at the {{trailing}} edge of airfoils (i. e., Gurney flaps) change the Kutta condition and thus produce higher lift. Unfortunately, however, the drag also increases {{due to the}} flow separation downstream of such modified trailing edges. The present work describes investigations aimed at the stabilization of the wake flow in order to achieve drag reduction and a decrease of sound generation. Using hot wire velocimetry, the existence of a tonal component could be observed in the broadband spectrum of the velocity fluctuations downstream of the Gurney flap. This points to the occurrence of a von Kárman vortex street (i. e., an absolute instability). This phenomenon persists even for turbulent boundary layers on the airfoil. Geometrical modifications of the Gurney flaps can reduce or eliminate the instability of the flow and can thus reduce or eliminate the existence of the tonal component of the velocity fluctuations of the wake. The effectiveness of trailing edge modifications like slits in Gurney flaps was investigated experimentally. These experiments were carried out with two-dimensional airfoils. The chord Reynolds number of these experiments was Re = 1 × 106. At lower angles of attack where the instabilities did occur, the geometrical modifications produced an appreciable drag reduction. This drag reduction was determined directly by force measurements using a <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>balance.</b> For {{a better understanding of the}} underlying flow physics, the unsteady flow structures in the wake of an airfoi...|$|E
40|$|Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) has {{demonstrated}} two measurement devices for sensing and resolving the hydrodynamic loads on fluid machinery. The first - a derivative {{of the six}} component <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>balance</b> - senses the forces and moments on the rotating device through a weakened shaft section instrumented {{with a series of}} strain gauges. This "rotating balance" was designed to directly measure the steady and unsteady hydrodynamic loads on an inducer, thereby defining both the amplitude and frequency content associated with operating in various cavitation modes. The second device - a high frequency response pressure transducer surface mounted on a rotating component - was merely an extension of existing technology for application in water. MSFC has recently completed experimental evaluations of both the rotating balance and surface-mount transducers in a water test loop. The measurement bandwidth of the rotating balance was severely limited by the relative flexibility of the device itself, resulting in an unexpectedly low structural bending mode and invalidating the higher frequency response data. Despite these limitations, measurements confirmed that the integrated loads on the four-bladed inducer respond to both cavitation intensity and cavitation phenomena. Likewise, the surface-mount pressure transducers were subjected to a range of temperatures and flow conditions in a non-rotating environment to record bias shifts and transfer functions between the transducers and a reference device. The pressure transducer static performance was within manufacturer's specifications and dynamic response accurately followed that of the reference...|$|E

The static and running friction for both thrust and radial loads was determined {{for a number of}} conical pivots and cylindrical and ball bearings. The static rocking friction was also measured for several conical and ball bearings under a heavy load, especially to determine their suitability for use in N. P. L. (National Physical Laboratory) type <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>balance.</b> In constructing conical pivots and sockets {{it was found that the}} pivots should be hardened and highly polished, preferably with a revolving lap, and that the sockets should be made by punching with a hardened and polished punch. It was found that for a light load the conical pivots give less friction than any other type, and their wearing qualities when hardened are excellent. Very small ball bearings are unsatisfactory because the proportional accuracy of the balls and races is not high enough to insure smooth running. For rocking pivots under heavy loads it was found that a ball-and-socket bearing, consisting of a hemispherical socket and a sphere of smaller diameter concentric with it, with a row of small balls resting between the two, was superior to a pivot resting in a socket. It was found that vibration such as occurs in an airplane will greatly reduce the static friction of a pivot or bearing, in some cases to as little as one-twentieth of its static value...|$|E
