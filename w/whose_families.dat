5|$|Wax {{became known}} for his {{activism}} during the Civil Rights Movement. Though some members—particularly those <b>whose</b> <b>families</b> {{had lived in the}} South for generations—had segregationist views, others were prominent in the fight for black civil rights. During Wax's tenure, most of Temple Israel's members moved far from the existing synagogue, and in 1976 the congregation constructed its current building, closer to where most members lived. Wax retired in 1978, and was succeeded by Harry Danziger, who brought traditional practices back to the congregation. He retired in 2000, and was succeeded by Micah Greenstein. , Temple Israel has almost 1,600 member families. Greenstein is the senior rabbi, and the cantorial soloist is Abbie Strauss.|$|E

25|$|Many of {{the reasons}} {{children}} were placed in care related to poverty and family breakdown. Until social change came about in Australia in the 1970s, {{there was almost no}} community or government support for families in crisis or financial need so most children <b>whose</b> <b>families</b> could not care for them were placed in some form of out-of-home care.|$|E
25|$|The {{area was}} slowly {{beginning}} to industrialize, and by 1836 there were factories making flannel and scythes in North Hoosick. Around 1850 Nairn Burgess built the hotel {{on his property}} to fill the demand for lodging, {{as many of the}} workers at the factory were migrants <b>whose</b> <b>families</b> lived elsewhere. It was also a stagecoach stop. A large barn, since demolished, sheltered horses and buggies.|$|E
25|$|As {{a further}} {{example of the}} government's {{commitment}} to nine-year compulsory education, in January 1986 the State Council drafted a bill passed at the Fourteenth Session of the Standing Committee of the Sixth National People's Congress that made it illegal for any organization or individual to employ youths before they had completed their nine years of schooling. The bill also authorized free education and subsidies for students <b>whose</b> <b>families</b> had financial difficulties.|$|E

25|$|In China, {{where the}} {{kidnapping}} and forced begging of children has been routinely documented, a multi-media movement has begun. Here, blogs are utilized to publicize over 3,000 photos of children <b>whose</b> <b>families</b> believe have been abducted {{for the purpose}} of begging, with hundreds of thousands of followers who remain on the look out for these children in major urban centers. This campaign has enabled at least six children to be recovered and reunited with their families.|$|E
25|$|After the 2001 {{terrorist}} attack on the Pentagon, Arlington National Cemetery Superintendent John C. Metzler, Jr. {{realized that there was}} a strong likelihood that many of the victims might not have their remains identified, while other remains might be commingled. Many of the victims would be military personnel <b>whose</b> <b>families</b> could choose to have their loved ones buried at Arlington. This would necessitate a group burial at the cemetery, and an appropriate monument to mark the grave.|$|E
25|$|Children <b>whose</b> <b>families</b> receive welfare, {{children}} whose parents dropped out of school, children of teenage parents, children raised by a lone parent, children raised in crime-ridden inner-city neighbourhoods, children who have multiple young siblings, and children who live in overcrowded substandard apartments {{are at risk of}} poor educational achievement in Germany. Often these factors go together, making it very hard for children to overcome the odds. A number of measures have been assessed to help those children reach their full potential.|$|E

25|$|Ghost detainees are extrajudicial prisoners whose identities {{have not}} been {{revealed}} and <b>whose</b> <b>families</b> (and frequently, governments) {{have not been}} informed of their status. They are deprived of all legal rights. Ghost detainees' identities, and capture, have been kept secret. As such they are a subset of extrajudicial prisoners, which includes all the detainees who were held in Guantanamo, etc..

25|$|As {{from the}} {{academic}} year 2010/2011, RIS has a Scholarship Fund Programme. This programme is intended to promote {{the growth of the}} school’s international community and to give promising non-Italian students, <b>whose</b> <b>families</b> lack sufficient financial resources, a chance to have a high-quality international education. Four scholarships will be granted: two for the Primary school and two for the Middle and High school. This programme is a system of financial assistance which allows for total coverage of tuition fees. The programme is initially funded by RIS and its families.|$|E
25|$|Croydon is {{also home}} to three single-sex Catholic state schools. The {{formerly}} independent John Fisher School in Purley has not charged fees since the late 1970s, but during the 1990s was selective, choosing boys via exams, interviews, tests, previous school reports and written statements. The school ended its selection policy in 1999, and now accepts pupils under a points system, which discriminates in favour of those who have high mass attendance and <b>whose</b> <b>families</b> are most involved in the Catholic Church. Coloma Convent Girls' School is one of England's Catholic girls' schools: formerly a grammar school, it has now, like John Fisher, adopted points-based admission criteria. St. Joseph's College, located on Beulah Hill in Upper Norwood, is a boys' school with a mixed sixth form.|$|E

25|$|Dallas is an American {{prime time}} {{television}} soap opera that aired on CBS from April 2, 1978, to May 3, 1991. The series revolves around a wealthy and feuding Texas family, the Ewings, {{who own the}} independent oil company Ewing Oil and the cattle-ranching land of Southfork. The series originally focused on the marriage of Bobby Ewing and Pamela Barnes, <b>whose</b> <b>families</b> were sworn enemies with each other. As the series progressed, oil tycoon J. R. Ewing became the show's breakout character, whose schemes and dirty business became the show's trademark. When the show ended in May 1991, J.R. was the only character to have appeared in every episode (though 3 episodes were with another actor wrapped in gause, as Hagman was renegotiating his contract).|$|E
25|$|Countless {{partnerships}} {{have emerged}} {{in the quest for}} food security. A number of federal nutrition programs exist to provide food specifically for children, including the Summer Food Service Program, Special Milk Program (SMP) and Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP), and community and state organizations often network with these programs. The Summer Food Program in Bangor, Maine, is run by the Bangor Housing Authority and sponsored by Good Shepherd Food Bank. In turn, Waterville Maine's Thomas College, for example, is among the organizations holding food drives to collect donations for Good Shepherd. Children <b>whose</b> <b>families</b> qualify for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) or Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) may also receive food assistance. WIC alone served approximately 7.6 million participants, 75% of which are children and infants.|$|E
25|$|Domestic servants, {{two-thirds of}} whom were women, made up about fifteen to {{twenty percent of the}} {{population}} of the capital. Before the Revolution they had worked largely for the nobility, <b>whose</b> <b>families</b> sometimes had as many as thirty servants. During the Empire they were employed more commonly by the new nobility, the newly wealthy and middle class. Upper-middle-class families often had three servants; families of artisans and shopkeepers usually had one. Living conditions of servants depended largely upon the personality of the master, but were never easy. Napoleon abolished the death penalty which previously could be given to a servant who stole from his master, but any servant who was even suspected of stealing would never be able to get another job. Any servant who became pregnant, married or not, could be dismissed immediately.|$|E

25|$|Post-World War I, northeastern Oklahoma had {{a racially}} and {{politically}} tense atmosphere. The territory {{had been established}} for resettlement of Native Americans from the Southeast, {{some of whom had}} owned slaves. Other areas had received many settlers from the South, <b>whose</b> <b>families</b> had been slaveholders before the American Civil War. It was admitted as a state on November 16, 1907. The newly created state legislature passed racial segregation laws, commonly known as Jim Crow laws, as one of its first orders of business. Its 1907 constitution and laws had voter registration rules that effectively disenfranchised most blacks; this also barred them from serving on juries or in local office, a situation that whites enforced until after passage of the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965. Major cities passed additional restrictions.|$|E
25|$|There was an {{increase}} in Jewish immigration to Ireland during {{the late nineteenth and early}} twentieth centuries. In 1871, the Jewish population of Ireland was 258; by 1881, it had risen to 453. Most of the immigration up to this time had come from England or Germany. A group who settled in Waterford were Welsh, <b>whose</b> <b>families</b> originally came from Central Europe. In the wake of the Russian pogroms there was increased immigration, mostly from Eastern Europe (in particular Lithuania). By 1901, there were an estimated 3,771 Jews in Ireland, over half of them (2,200) residing in Dublin. By 1904, the total Jewish population had reached an estimated 4,800. New synagogues and schools were established to cater for the immigrants, many of whom established shops and other businesses. Many of the following generation became prominent in business, academic, political and sporting circles.|$|E
25|$|Like most {{industrialists}} of his era, Roach was staunchly anti-union, {{and insisted}} his employees negotiate {{on an individual}} basis for their wages. Roach however, took the concept of individual negotiation much further than most of his contemporaries. Instead of paying a set wage to workers based on their qualifications or skill, he organized a sliding scale of wages for each group, based on a set of criteria Roach himself deemed important. A worker who met all the criteria would receive the top rate, while those who did not would have their wages progressively reduced, depending on the number of criteria they failed. Criteria for payment included not only a worker's skill level, but his punctuality, dependability, eagerness and quality of work, in addition to which his moral character was subject to assessment. Workers who spent too much on alcohol, who paid their rent erratically, <b>whose</b> <b>families</b> were poorly clothed, or whose children did not attend church or school, could expect to have their wages reduced still further.|$|E
