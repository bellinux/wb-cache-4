The front moved {{gradually}} off the coast and into the subtropical Atlantic Ocean before becoming stationary just east of Bermuda on September 15. Over the next two days, the cloud cover slowly detached itself from the front and form into a tropical low in its own right. On the afternoon of September 17, the system was organized enough to be declared Tropical Depression Four.|$|E
25|$|Iceland was {{discovered}} by Naddodd, {{one of the first}} settlers on the Faroe Islands, who was sailing from Norway to the Faroe Islands but got lost and drifted to the east coast of Iceland. Naddoddr named the country Snæland (Snowland). Swedish sailor Garðar Svavarsson also accidentally drifted to the coast of Iceland. He discovered that the country was an island and named it Garðarshólmi (literally Garðar's Islet) and stayed for the winter at Húsavík. The first Scandinavian who deliberately sailed to Garðarshólmi was Flóki Vilgerðarson, also known as Hrafna-Flóki (Raven-Flóki). Flóki settled for one winter at Barðaströnd. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> winter, and when he spotted some drift ice in the fjords he gave the island its current name, Ísland (Iceland).|$|E

25|$|Already in 1883, Eckenfelder had {{exhibited}} his Überschwemmung im Neckarthal (Flooding in the Neckar Valley) at {{the international}} art exhibition in the Glaspalast in Munich. Prince Regent Luitpold of Bavaria purchased his painting Pferde vor dem Pflug (Ploughing Horses) in 1888 and Eckenfelder was {{for the first time}} mentioned in the specialist press. The prince regent took a lively interest in the artistic life of Munich and through such acquisitions supported young artists not only financially, but also with the renown they entailed. He often visited painters in their studios. When he paid his first such visit to Eckenfelder, it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> day and the artist was wrapped up against the cold and wearing thick winter slippers; Eckenfelder was so embarrassed that soon after he formed the habit of wearing dress shoes and a suit with no smock when working. He maintained this habit until late in life.|$|E
25|$|Gemini and Cheiron {{were the}} first {{characters}} to be created for the game. Gemini became the central heroine who would represent the Redneck stereotype, while the African American Cherion acted {{as a means for}} the story to tackle issues of discrimination in American culture. Each additional character was based around a particular theme; Rosarita was themed around Spaghetti Western culture, Subaru <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> perfectionist similar to Sakura Wars 2 heroine Reni Milchstrasse, while Diana would be a handicapped character in a similar vein to Lobelia from Sakura Wars 3. Ratchet Altair, who had appeared in , was also included as a principle character and romance option. Rather than established protagonist Ichiro Ogami, the story focused on new protagonist Shinjiro. According to Hiroi, Shinjiro was the most difficult character to create, with the main aim being to differentiate his story from that of Ogami, with Shinjiro being made a more vulnerable character. The renewed cast played into the theme of a young country, whose actions would be performed in parallel to events in Japan. Fujishima was initially confused about the kings of characters Hiroi wanted, drawing multiple variations. Speaking about his design for Gemini, Fujishima described his design as having a samurai core within a stylized cowgirl.|$|E

I think she's just more determined than most people to be herself." [...] Two years later, however, Ono publicly compared Lennon to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, while McCartney, she said, more closely resembled his less-talented rival Antonio Salieri. This remark infuriated McCartney's wife Linda, who was dying from breast cancer at the time, and when Linda died {{less than a year}} later, McCartney did not invite Ono to his wife's memorial service in Manhattan.|$|E
500|$|W. G. Grace is {{believed}} to have considered retirement from cricket before the 1878 season after he was seriously injured in a shooting accident the previous autumn which nearly cost him the sight of an eye. Having recovered, he reconsidered and in 1878 played in 33 matches, 24 of which are generally recognised as first-class. His main roles in the season were captain of Gloucestershire County Cricket Club and both match organiser and captain of the United South of England Eleven (USEE). In addition, he represented Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), the Gentlemen in the Gentlemen v Players fixture and the South in the North v South series. 1878 <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold,</b> wet summer and not one of Grace's better seasons as a batsman, but he was very effective in such conditions as a right arm medium pace roundarm bowler and completed a sixth successive [...] "double" [...] by scoring 1,151 runs and taking 152 wickets in the recognised first-class matches.|$|E
500|$|Ian Fleming's novel <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>Cold</b> War thriller but the {{producers}} replaced the Soviet undercover agency SMERSH {{with the crime}} syndicate SPECTRE {{so as to avoid}} controversial political overtones. The SPECTRE training grounds were inspired by the film Spartacus. The original screenwriter was Len Deighton, who accompanied Harry Saltzman, Syd Cain, and Terence Young to Istanbul but he was replaced {{because of a lack of}} progress. Thus, two of Dr. Nos writers, Johanna Harwood and Richard Maibaum, returned for the second film in the series Some sources state Harwood with being credited for [...] "adaptation" [...] mostly for her suggestions which were carried over into Maibaum's script. Harwood stated in an interview in a Cinema Retro that she had been a screenwriter of several of Harry Saltzman's projects, and her screenplay for From Russia with Love had followed Fleming's novel closely, but she left the series due to what she called Terence Young's constant rewriting of her screenplay with ideas that were not in the original Fleming work.|$|E
