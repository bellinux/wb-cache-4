5|$|A notable {{feature of}} Bristol's {{architecture}} is the Bristol Byzantine style. Characterised by complicated polychrome brick and decorative arches, this style {{was used in}} the construction of factories, warehouses and municipal buildings built in the Victorian era. Surviving examples include the Colston Hall, the Granary on Welsh Back, and the Gloucester Road Carriage Works, along with some of the buildings around Victoria Street. Several of the warehouses around the harbour have also survived, including the Arnolfini, which now houses an art gallery. Clarks Wood Company warehouse, the St Vincent's Works in Silverthorne Lane, and the <b>Wool</b> <b>Hall</b> in St Thomas Street, are other survivors from the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Morrison {{moved back}} to Europe in the late 1970s, first {{settling}} in London's Notting Hill Gate area. Later, he moved to Bath, where he purchased the <b>Wool</b> <b>Hall</b> studio in January 1994. He also has {{a home in the}} Irish seaside village of Dalkey near Dublin, where legal actions against two different neighbours concerning safety and privacy issues have been taken to court in 2001 and in 2010.

50|$|Australian Mercantile Land & Finance (AML&F), an English-Australian company {{incorporated}} in 1863, had offices in London, Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane by 1910 when its Vernon Terrace land was purchased. The company employed leading architect Robin Dods and builders Walls & Juster {{to create an}} elegant but functional woolstore during 1912, thereby {{taking advantage of the}} 1910s boom in <b>wool.</b> The original <b>Hall</b> & Dods architectural plans included a second store, which was built in about 1922 to cope with the subsequent boom of the 1920s.|$|R
50|$|The site in Dorset was {{selected}} {{and led to}} the formation of the opposition group, the Dorset Land Resources Committee, led by Colonel Joseph Weld. The government stepped in and passed the Winfrith Heath Bill in 1957, allowing the AEA to acquire 650 acres by compulsory purchase order and another similar size through normal purchases to bring the site to 1,350 acres. To house the staff, they also purchased 153 homes in Bournemouth and Poole for staff to rent, as well as 127 in Weymouth, 100 in Dorchester, 24 in Wareham and 12 in <b>Wool.</b> The Durley <b>Hall</b> Hotel at Branksome Chine was bought in 1958 for single staff and temporary accommodation.|$|R
25|$|As {{the economy}} {{recovered}} {{during the second}} half of the 1930s, a number of substantial improvements were made to the RNA's exhibition facilities. In 1936, Gailey called tenders for a <b>Wool</b> <b>Hall,</b> additions to the pig and horse pavilions, new Stock & Station Agents' offices and dining hall and a new yearling sale ring. New concrete roads and additional seating accommodation were provided. The old Industrial Pavilion was demolished in 1938 and its replacement, designed by Richard Gailey Jnr and covering an area of 3.5 acres, was completed along Gregory Terrace in June 1939 at a cost of £40,000. A new electricity hall at the corner of Gregory Terrace and Costin Street was also completed for the 1939 show – reputedly the first show pavilion in Australia dedicated entirely to electricity exhibits. (The Hall of Science, as it was later known, was demolished in 1986 to make way for a new Exhibition Building).|$|E
2500|$|Several {{months before}} the Smiths dissolved, Morrissey had enlisted Stephen Street as his {{personal}} producer and new songwriting partner, with whom he could begin his solo career. By September 1987, he had begun work on his first solo album, Viva Hate, at <b>Wool</b> <b>Hall</b> Studios near Bath; it was recorded with the musicians Vini Reilly and Andrew Paresi. Rather than featuring pre-existing images of celebrities, as the Smiths' album and single covers had done, Viva Hate featured a photograph of Morrissey taken by Anton Corbijn on its cover sleeve. In February 1988, EMI released the first single from this album, [...] "Suedehead", which reached number 5 on the British singles chart, a higher position than any Smiths' single had achieved. The second single from the album, [...] "Everyday Is Like Sunday", was released in June and reached number 9. The album reached number 1 on the UK album charts. The album's final song, [...] "Margaret on the Guillotine", featured descriptions of Thatcher being executed; in response, the Conservative Member of Parliament Geoffrey Dickens accused Morrissey {{of being involved in}} a terrorist network and police Special Branch conducted a search of his Manchester home.|$|E
