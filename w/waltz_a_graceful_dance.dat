50|$|Polonesse (French Polonaise, Polish Polonez) is the {{commonly}} used name of Polonaise in ¾-beat in elderly Swedish fiddler books. In the South and East of Sweden the dance usually is called slängpolska, while many other names are {{used on the}} local dance forms, such as Bingsjöpolska, Leksandslåt, Hälsingepolska, etc. When the dance was introduced in Sweden in the early 1700s it was <b>a</b> <b>graceful</b> <b>dance</b> in <b>a</b> relaxed tempo and the dance was of the accompanied by minuet, sometimes as a single dance (suite) to the same melody. During the 1700s century the polonesse was evolved from eightbeat polonesse (not {{to be confused with}} the eight Polish) to sixteenth polonesse (commonly called the sixteenth Polish) and locally also in the faster tempo and wilder dance. In the border areas of Norway the eightbeat polonesse with triplets quickly got its own line of development.|$|R

50|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} stepdances, which are {{named after the}} musical tempos that they are danced to. A reel, the most popular step dance, is played in 4/4 time, and is fun, fast and lively. A jig, also quite popular, is played in 6/8 time and sounds like an energetic march.

5000|$|The varsovienne, {{also known}} as the varsouvienne or varsoviana, is <b>a</b> slow, <b>graceful</b> <b>dance</b> in [...] time with an accented downbeat in {{alternate}} measures. It combines elements of the waltz, mazurka, and polka. The dance originated around 1850 in Warsaw, Poland. The words varsovienne and varsoviana are French and Spanish feminine adjectives, respectively, meaning 'from Warsaw'. The dance was popular in 19th-century America, where it was danced to the tune Put Your Little Foot. It quickly became a favorite folk dance in the Scandinavian countries as well. The unique armhold by the same name - {{also known as}} the promenade hold - is used in other dance styles such as the American square dance, contra dance, and some ballroom dances.|$|R
6000|$|In order, probably, to {{give the}} warriors a brief {{breathing}} space, another song is now set up, and it is marvellous the accuracy and knowledge of melody with which the parts are sung, like a glee of catch, the time being kept by a conductor, who rushes from rank to rank beating time with a wand. Yet it is hardly like chanting, rather like a weird, sobbing melody, with tones in it which range from the deepest bass to the shrillest treble. It ends in a long sigh, and then follows a scene, a tumult, a melee, which hardly admits of a description in words. The warriors engage in a mimic combat, once more they charge, retreat, conquer, and are defeated, all in turns. In front of them, exciting them to new exertions, with word and gesture, undulate in <b>a</b> <b>graceful</b> <b>dance</b> of their own the [...] "intombis," [...] the young beauties of the tribe, with green branches in their hands, and all their store of savage finery glittering on their shapely limbs. Some of these maidens are really handsome, and round them again dance the children, armed with mimic spears and shields. Wild as seems the confusion, through it all, even the moments of highest excitement, some sort of rough order is maintained; more, it would seem, by mutual sounds than by word of command or sense of discipline.|$|R
50|$|And in 2010, India {{finally won}} the Miss Earth crown through Nicole Faria.

As a Miss Earth winner, one of Nicole's highlights during her reign was she focused on her country's problem. She focused her reign in addressing Bangalore lakes problems which have rapidly disappeared in the past 30 years from about 270-300 lakes to about 80 lakes remained due to industrial development and have been heavily polluted by human and industrial waste.|$|R
