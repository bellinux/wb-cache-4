5|$|After {{having my}} own child, it's pretty amazing what females are capable of. We're Supergirl, {{we do it}} all: we give the love, we give the milk. On the other hand, I'm running a business. I'm running my career. That comes with being labeled a bitch. If that's what I'm gonna be called by being {{assertive}} and knowing <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> and what I want out of life, then so be it. I will wear that label proudly. For me it's about turning that word into a positive.|$|E
5|$|Do I wish I {{had never}} endured post-partum depression? Absolutely. But {{to deny the}} {{experience}} is to deny <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> I still mourn the loss of what could have been, but I also feel deep gratitude for those who stood by me, for the lesson that we must never be afraid to ask for help, and for the feeling of summer that still remains.|$|E

60|$|The manager {{turned to}} me. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> an {{occasional}} customer, {{and he knew}} <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was.</b>|$|R
60|$|THE CLERK. They knew <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was.</b> That's {{why they}} wouldn't let me up.|$|R
5|$|We {{really wanted}} to do {{something}} that just shows <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> We weren't trying to make a better version of myself. It was really more about fun and being spontaneous. All of the mistakes were allowed to be there, which was the same for the song. The way that the song was recorded was very live. We played everything live, we didn't stop to edit ourselves, it was very intuitive and I wanted the video to have that energy, as well.|$|E
5|$|Leroux {{was one of}} 21 {{professional}} athletes featured in ESPN's The Body Issue in 2013. She appeared semi-nude on one of eight covers for the magazine. Of the experience she said, I {{think a lot of}} females struggle with the way they look, and I wanted to show that everyone's body is different. I think it's a big deal to be an athlete and feel confident in your body and show it off. I'm not going to say I've never struggled with how I look, but I've reached a point in my life where I'm happy with <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b>|$|E
5|$|While {{travelling}} {{on a train}} Abbe {{noticed an}} older man staring at him who then {{asked if he was}} a 5th Dan Judo. Abbe replied “Why yes, how did you know that?” “Because you have the build of a 5th Dan. So who are you?“ Kenshiro replied: “Everyone knows <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> I am Kenshiro Abbe, Judo champion of all Japan! “ Yes, I can see that,“ the old man replied. The old man continued to talk to Kenshiro much to his annoyance as he wanted to get some sleep. Eventually, the old man put a finger in Kenshiro’s face, “You are so powerful, break my finger!” Kenshiro was only too happy to oblige. He took the finger, expecting to snap it like a twig, and wham! He found himself on the carriage floor under the full control of the old man. The old man allowed Kenshiro to get back into his seat. “Who are you?” Kenshiro Abbe asked. “I am Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of Aikido.” Kenshiro Abbe was astounded at the technique of the old man and requested that he become his student.|$|E
60|$|I {{wrote it}} for him. His face darkened {{when he found}} out <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{opening of}} <b>Who</b> <b>Id</b> <b>Be</b> is {{reminiscent}} of [...] "Bring Him Home" [...] from Les Misérables.|$|R
25|$|I don't {{think my}} books {{are going to}} be really graphic or dark, because of <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> There's {{always going to be a}} lot of light in my stories.|$|E
25|$|To promote <b>Who</b> <b>I</b> <b>AM,</b> he {{embarked}} on a tour to Colombia, Chile, Brazil, Argentina, Dominican Republic and Mexico. In this last country, Mateo performed with Carlos Rivera at Teatro Metropólitan and with the Mexican boyband CD9 at Mexico City Arena. The <b>Who</b> <b>I</b> <b>AM</b> concert tour began in December 2014 in Barcelona and ended after nine months and almost 40 shows, including a big concert at Sports Palace, in Madrid. He held his first solo concerts in Mexico City, at Plaza Condesa, and Peru, and his second sold-out concert at legendary Luna Park arena, in Buenos Aires.|$|E
25|$|It {{is such an}} {{interesting}} drama to see a nation create itself, that I – if I now had not been <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> – would go to America to follow up close every phase {{in the emergence of}} this new republic. – This perhaps is America's century. The new republic, which hardly has a population put together better than Rome had to begin with, may perhaps take advantage of Europe some day, {{in the same manner as}} Europe has taken advantage of America for two centuries. No matter what, I cannot help but admire their courage and enthusiastically appreciate their daring.|$|E

60|$|The eminent {{traveller}} did me the honour {{of waking}} up in an instant, and asking me <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was.</b>|$|R

25|$|One of {{his drawing}} pupils was Margaret Lindsay, eldest {{daughter}} of Sir Alexander Lindsay of Evelick and Amelia Murray (granddaughter to David Murray, 5th Viscount of Stormont and sister to the naval officer John Lindsay). He later eloped {{with her and}} on 1 March 1752 they married in the Canongate Kirk, Edinburgh; her father never forgave her for marrying an artist. Ramsay already had to maintain a daughter from his previous marriage and his two surviving sisters, but told Sir Alexander that he could provide Margaret with an annual income of £100. He said it would increase ‘as my affairs increase, and I thank God, {{they are in a}} way of increasing’ and that his only motive for the marriage was ‘my love for your Daughter, <b>who,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sensible, is entitled to much more than ever I shall have to bestow upon her’. Three children survived from their long and happy marriage, Amelia (1755–1813), Charlotte (1758–1818?), and John (1768–1845).|$|E
500|$|Playwright Royce Ryton wrote I Am <b>Who</b> <b>I</b> <b>Am</b> about Anna Anderson in 1978. Like {{the earlier}} plays, it depicts Anderson as [...] "a person of {{intrinsic}} worth victimized by the greed {{and fears of}} others" [...] and {{did not attempt to}} decide her real identity.|$|E
500|$|According to Nickson, Carey {{chose to}} express her {{innermost}} feelings in her songs rather than becoming depressed and bitter throughout the hardships in her life. [...] "You really have to look inside yourself and find your own inner strength, and say, `I'm proud of what I am and <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> and I'm {{just going to be}} myself." ...|$|E
50|$|Callea said, “It’s {{been really}} {{interesting}} {{working with people}} overseas who had no idea <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> or where <b>I</b> come from”.|$|R

5000|$|Despite its {{commercial}} success, the song actually began to trigger {{some of the}} identity crises that would later plague Davies' personal life. He wrote later: With 'A Dedicated Follower of Fashion' such a hit, people started coming up {{to me on the}} street and singing the chorus in my face: 'Oh yes he is, oh yes he is,' as if to say that <b>I</b> knew <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was.</b> Unfortunately, my inner and somewhat distorted sense of reality told me that this <b>was</b> not <b>who</b> <b>I</b> wanted to be: <b>I</b> didn't know <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was.</b>|$|R
500|$|On the [...] 43rd {{episode of}} her web video series, Transmission Gagavision, Gaga told the {{interviewer}} {{that the greatest}} challenge she faced while writing [...] "Born This Way" [...] was how she could leave her insecurities behind her, and become confident. [...] "'Born This Way' is <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> An artist {{in a constant state}} of half-fantasy/half-reality at all times," [...] she added.|$|E
500|$|In March2011, James {{confirmed}} {{that she had}} left Home and Away. She has already filmed her final scenes and Nicole will leave on-screen later in the year. Of her departure, James said [...] "I was at Home and Away for three-and-a-half-years, so it's good to be finished and get to be <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> and do what I've wanted to do for so long." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2012, in an interview, Pusha T {{spoke on}} the {{inspiration}} behind the album title. [...] "Basically, I tried to pick a title that embodied <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> as an artist. I wanted people to understand like Pusha is everything that I really, really am. Actually, there is a line in 'Pain' where I say [...] "My name is my name," [...] that line comes from Marlo Stanfield from the series The Wire. It {{was one of the}} more prominent catch phrases that he said {{at the end of that}} series. He was basically saying, I am <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> I stand on my name I live this. I really felt that embodied my presence in the rap game." [...] Pusha T announced the new title of his album in November 2012, along with Spin reporting that his album had been pushed back until 2013. On March 19, 2013 Pusha T said that the album would include 13 songs and that he had already finished 11 of those songs.|$|E
60|$|Though he <b>was</b> my husband, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not {{permitted}} to get to him. When <b>I</b> announced <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> promptly placed under arrest.

500|$|Cammalleri {{was born}} in Richmond Hill, Ontario, and was raised there in a secular {{household}} (he described his upbringing as [...] "non-denominational"). His father, Leo, is of Sicilian-Catholic descent, and his mother, Ruth, is Jewish. He has one sister, Melanie. His maternal grandparents, from Poland and Czechoslovakia, were Holocaust survivors. [...] He said: [...] "It's a family of deep-rooted closeness and unity coming from very desperate times. It is <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> as a person." ...|$|E
500|$|Lecrae {{said in a}} {{statement}} to AllHipHop: [...] "With the release of Gravity, I really wanted to expand on my previous work while still making sure to keep it all very authentic to <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> as an artist as well as a person When I released Church Clothes earlier this year, it was the precursor of what's come with this album. It introduced my music to new audiences, allowing me to impact others." ...|$|E
500|$|The final alleged {{stalking}} incident came {{to light}} on December 13, 2005. In the preceding days, Cho had contacted a female friend of Koch via AIM and wrote on her door board {{a line from the}} Act 2, Scene II of the Shakespeare play Romeo and Juliet. In the passage, Romeo laments to Juliet" [...] a name, I know not how to tell <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself, because it is an enemy to thee. Had I it written, I would tear the word." ...|$|E
