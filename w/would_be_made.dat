Hawker Typhoons and Republic P-47 Thunderbolts strafed German positions throughout the day and occasionally dueled with the Luftwaffe over the battlefield. The RAF attempted their final resupply flight from Britain on the Saturday afternoon, but lost eight planes for little gain to the Airborne troops. Some small resupply efforts <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> from Allied airfields in Europe {{over the next two}} days but to little effect.|$|E

Police officers established a reception area for law enforcement personnel at Wirtz Hall, and an investigative command center at Holmes Student Center. By 4:00p.m. CST, school officials announced {{that there was no}} further danger. They said that counselors <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> available in all residence halls.|$|E
5|$|By 26 December, strong German defences had stalled Canadian {{forces in}} Ortona and British and New Zealand forces in Orsogna. Although both Ortona and Villa Grande were {{captured}} {{by the end of}} December, general exhaustion among the Allied forces prevented the capture of Orsogna and an advance to Pescara. When harsh winter weather set in, it became clear to the Allied commanders that no further progress <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> and General Alexander called off the offensive.|$|E

5|$|Connections <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> to the BMT Nassau Street Line, the Williamsburg Bridge, and the Manhattan Bridge.

5|$|Describing {{the system}} in November 1988, Cray stated that the 12 times {{performance}} increase <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> up of a three times increase due to GaAs circuits, and four times due {{to the use of}} more processors. One of the problems with the Cray-2 had been poor multiprocessing performance due to limited bandwidth between the processors, and to address this the Cray-3 would adopt the much faster architecture used in the Cray Y-MP. This would provide a design performance of 8000 MIPS, or 16 GFLOPS.|$|E
5|$|In {{line with}} the president's wishes, matters of policy were {{restricted}} to the president, Wallace, Bush, Conant, Secretary of War Henry Stimson and the Chief of Staff of the Army, General George C.

5|$|The Loboc Church is {{currently}} in the tentative list for UNESCO World Heritage Sites under the Baroque Churches of the Philippines (Extension). A proposal has been suggested by scholars to make a separate UNESCO inclusion for the Old Centre of Loboc which includes the Loboc Church. The same <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> for other churches listed in UNESCO's tentative sites, where each town plaza and surrounding heritage buildings would be added. No government agency has yet to take action on the proposal.|$|E
5|$|The {{influential}} eighteenth-century Reformed theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher saw {{problems with}} all of the Reformation positions on Christ's presence in the Eucharist, and hoped that a new articulation of the doctrine <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>made.</b> He emphasized the function of the Supper of confirming Christians' union with Christ as well as the union they have with one another.|$|E

5|$|The series {{underwent}} further {{changes during}} {{the months leading up}} to and following its debut. A May 2006 press release mentioned that sketches from The Girlie Show <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> available in their entirety on NBC's broadband website, DotComedy.com.

5|$|Traditionally, {{the metal}} {{used for the}} gandingan was bronze but due to its {{scarcity}} after WWII, gandingan are more commonly made of less valuable metals such as steel sheets. Recently, galvanized steel sheets {{have been used by}} Maguindanaon instrument manufacturers where different parts of the gong (the knob, body and rim) <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> from separate sheets and welded together, then ground out to produce a finished product. Comparatively, these newer gongs have a higher pitch and are smaller in size than those made in older times.|$|E
