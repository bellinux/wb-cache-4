50|$|A major {{attraction}} of Lecher lines {{was they were}} a way to measure frequency without complicated electronics, and could be improvised from simple materials found in a typical shop. Lecher line <b>wavemeters</b> are usually built on a frame which holds the conductors rigid and horizontal, with a track that the shorting bar or indicator rides on, and a built-in measuring scale so the distance between nodes can be read out. The frame must be made of a nonconductive material like wood, because any conducting objects near the line can disturb the standing wave pattern. The RF current is usually coupled into the line through a single turn loop of wire at one end, which can be held near a transmitter's tank coil.|$|R

40|$|The {{transport}} with High Speed Craft (HSC), {{in other}} words with hydrofoils, catamarans and monohulls, involves indisputable advantages in the movements via sea; on the other hand, the high speeds reached by these means cause wake wash waves that have {{negative impact on the}} coastal environment and on the structures set in proximity of the shoreline, as well as on people safety. These wake wash waves may be significantly reduced by estimating their magnitude and choosing opportunely routes andspeed. This note describes a study conducted for this purpose which shows how, with the aidof cartography and low-cost GPS satellite receivers, it is possible to detect, with accu-racy suitable to the purposes required, a set of parameters (distance from the coast,speed and depth), relative to an HSC, to be correlated with <b>wavemeters</b> data for the phenomenon analysis...|$|R
5000|$|Two {{methods are}} {{employed}} {{to find the}} nodes. [...] One is to use some type of voltage indicator, such as an RF voltmeter or light bulb, attached {{to a pair of}} contacts that slide up and down the wires. [...] When the bulb reaches a node, the voltage between the wires goes to zero, so the bulb goes out. If the indicator has too low an impedance it will disturb the standing wave on the line, so a high impedance indicator must be used; a regular incandescent bulb has too low a resistance. Lecher and early researchers used long thin Geissler tubes, laying the glass tube directly across the line. The high voltage of early transmitters excited a glow discharge in the gas. In modern times small neon bulbs are often used. One problem with using glow discharge bulbs is their high striking voltage makes it difficult to localize the exact voltage minimum. In precision <b>wavemeters</b> an RF voltmeter is used.|$|R

Wake wash analysis was performed by field measurements along Napoli-Ischia and Napoli-Sorrento-Capri routes, recording two different data sets: the effective route, by GPS installed onboard of several in service ships, and the produced wake wash monitored by several <b>wavemeters,</b> positioned in three critical points along the examined navigation tracks. Measured wake wash data have been subsequently compared with limit values suggested by International Rules, to establish some operational strategies and mitigative measures. On the basis of the obtained results, it was found the minimum distance between shoreline and navigation tracks had to be increased up to 500 and 1000 m for Napoli–Ischia and Sorrento–Capri routes, respectively. These prescriptions, furnished to the Civil Protection Department of Naples Province, have been already adopted by some Coast Guard recommendations, in accordance with the main Ship Companies operating in the Gulf of Naples...|$|R

5000|$|An {{absorption}} <b>wavemeter</b> is {{a simple}} electronic instrument {{used to measure the}} frequency of radio waves. It is an older method of measuring frequency, widely used from the birth of radio in the early 20th century until the 1970s, when the development of inexpensive frequency counters, which have far greater accuracy, made it largely obsolete. A <b>wavemeter</b> consists of an adjustable resonant circuit calibrated in frequency, with a meter or other means to measure the voltage or current in the circuit. When adjusted to resonance with the unknown frequency, the resonant circuit absorbs energy, which is indicated by a dip on the meter. Then the frequency can be read from the dial.|$|E

40|$|Active sensor {{devices for}} the sea surface {{have been used}} for many years in order to supply large scale {{information}} on the wave and wind fields. Among them, the most important is the satellite altimeter, whose main application so far has mostly been related to the calibration of forecasting or hind-casting models over the oceans. Enclosed or semi-enclosed seas pose a bigger challenge because of the rapidly varying wind and sea state fields, {{as well as of the}} relatively scarce time and space density of the coverage. The Arabian Gulf, in particular, is an ideal testing field for the synergy between wave modeling and satellite altimeter wave monitoring, since rainfall, one of the main cases of altimeter disturbances, is rare or virtually absent. Wave climate in the Gulf has already been thoroughly considered in depth and a full WAM based simulating system was setup. There is, however, a comparative scarcity of field data to verify and calibrate such a system, therefore the availability of space data is an important option. This paper presents some comparisons between the WAM based modeling system at Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research (KISR), with ERS- 2, Envisat and Jason- 1 altimeter data. Some measurements taken by <b>wavemeters</b> located off Dubai were also considered. In addition to that, the importance and the possible causes of small spatial scale oscillation of both wind and wave measurements from altimeter data is considered; such oscillations mightprovide an indication of spatial storm variability on a smaller scale than that of the standard meteo grids...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} high {{frequency}} millimetre wave oscillators is performed operating at W- band and above, using test bench equipment designed and constructed in St. Andrews. Octave tuneable oscillators have been designed, constructed, {{and used to}} characterise developmental Gunn devices, {{as well as to}} provide ideal oscillators for test bench measurement systems. These oscillators have been sold to many millimetre-wave laboratories throughout Britain. The operation, optimisation and characterisation of these oscillators is described in detail, and various non-linear effects are explained and modelled successfully. The wideband tuneability and matching has also allowed evaluation of new developmental Gunn devices to accurately determine the optimum operating frequency range of the devices. This was part of a developmental program by GEC Hirst and MEDL which has now produced state of the art GaAs Gunn oscillators at 94 GHz. Much of the characterisation of the oscillators is performed using novel quasi-optical techniques, which has allowed low loss accurate performance at these very high frequencies. Several quasi-optical techniques are described and the design, manufacture and evaluation of many optical components are given. In particular, the frequency and harmonic content of the oscillators was determined using a Martin-Puplett Interferometer which utilised a frequency counting technique. This enabled easy wideband measurements to be performed with much greater accuracy than traditional cavity <b>wavemeters.</b> In addition, a state of the art noise bench has been designed and constructed for operation at W -band and above, that utilises a novel open resonator to effect a very high Q suppression filter.

40|$|Optical {{communications}} {{has experienced}} a rapid development during the last decade. More bandwidth can be acquired by decreasing the spacing of the optical channels or by increasing the data rate. Characterization of the optical components and active monitoring of the network calls for accurate measurement methods. The objective of this thesis is to investigate and develop measurement methods and instruments for measuring important parameters of the components used in optical communications. Chromatic dispersion of optical fibers and frequency chirp of the laser transmitters set limits for the data rate and transmission distance. Measurements of dispersion have traditionally been performed using a phase-shift method. When high modulation frequencies are applied to achieve high resolution an error could be introduced. In this thesis, the measurement accuracy of this method is analyzed in detail and a novel method for estimating the accuracy and correcting the measurement result is developed. A Fabry-Perot interferometer finds numerous applications in many fields of optics. In this thesis, tunable Fabry-Perot etalon filters made of silicon were developed and several applications for these devices are demonstrated. A new device for measurements of time-resolved frequency chirp of directly modulated laser diodes in real time is developed. Interaction between the dispersion and frequency chirp limits the use of directly modulated lasers in long-haul optical links. Another application is monitoring of the wavelength of optical transmitters. The wavelength of the laser diode may shift due to aging and active monitoring and controlling of the wavelength is required. In addition, the filter improves {{the performance of the}} directly modulated transmitter by temporal reshaping of the pulses. The filter is also applied in reducing the frequency chirp of gain-switched pulses generated with a diode laser. These pulses can then be made transform limited and can for example be used in generation of optical solitons. Finally, the etalon is employed in realization of a compact wavelength reference for calibration of the wavelength scale of the optical spectrum analyzers and <b>wavemeters.</b> The transmission spectrum of the etalon consists of equidistant fringes. Each of these fringes can be applied as an accurate reference over a large wavelength range once the temperature of the filter is stabilized. This reference was developed to be automatic and it has an adequate accuracy for performing calibrations of field instruments. reviewe...|$|R

He eventually turned to the piezo-electrical crystal to develop the first quartz clock. Louis Essen joined Dye's research group at the National Physical Laboratory in 1929 and went on to develop practical clocks after Dye's death. By 1927 he had moved on to develop a magnetometer capable of measuring the vertical element of the earth's magnetic field, which was so accurate that it was incorporated into the Abinger Magnetic Observatory.|$|E

The station's impending shutdown was announced in 1926, but it was saved by a flood of protests from citizens who relied on the service. Later, in 1931, WWV underwent an upgrade. Its transmitter, now directly controlled by a quartz oscillator, was moved to College Park, Maryland. Broadcasts began on 5 MHz. A year later, the station was moved again, to Department of Agriculture land in Beltsville, Maryland. Broadcasts were added on 10 and 15 MHz, power was increased, and time signals, an A440 tone, and ionosphere reports were all added to the broadcast in June 1937.|$|E
50|$|During World War II, Essen {{worked on}} radar and {{developed}} a number of instruments, including the cavity resonance <b>wavemeter.</b> It was this work that suggested to Essen {{the possibility of a}} more precise measurement of the speed of light. In 1946, in collaboration with A.C. Gordon-Smith, he used a microwave cavity, of precisely known dimensions, and exploited his expertise in time-measurement to establish the frequency for a variety of its normal modes. As the wavelength of the modes was known from the geometry of the cavity and from electromagnetic theory, knowledge of the associated frequencies enabled a calculation of the speed of light. Their result, 299,792±3 km/s, was substantially greater than that from the prevailing sequence of optical measurements that had begun around the start of the 20th century and Essen had to withstand some fierce criticism and disbelief. Even NPL director Sir Charles Galton Darwin, while supporting the work, observed that Essen would get the correct result once he had perfected the technique. Moreover, W.W. Hansen at Stanford University had used a similar technique and obtained a measurement which was more consistent with the conventional (optical) wisdom. However, a combination of Essen's stubbornness, his iconoclasm and his belief in his own skill at measurement (and a little help with calculations from Alan Turing) inspired him to refine his apparatus and to repeat his measurement in 1950, establishing a result of 299,792.5±1 km/s. This was the value adopted by the 12th General Assembly of the Radio-Scientific Union in 1957. Most subsequent measurements have been consistent with this value. In 1983, the 17th Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures adopted the standard value, 299,792.458 km/s for the speed of light.|$|E
