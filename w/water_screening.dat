The current literature on <b>water</b> <b>screening</b> {{is limited to}} hydrocarbon flames.

A wide range of hydrogen flames and water screen scenarios are investigated.

The study further analyses the total transmissivity of water screens calculated from (i) the actual hydrogen spectrum and (ii) a blackbody spectrum.

Coastal ecosystems worldwide remain vulnerable to damage from aquatic species introductions, particularly via ballast water discharge from ships.

It is not surprising that hospital waters may be colonized with legionnaire bacterium. Cold and hot water samples from different hospitals of Tehran were screened, using standard culture method and PCR technique. A total of 132 cold and hot water samples were collected during the summer of 2006. All samples were concentrated and cultured on standard BCYE agar after pretreatment. The mip gene based primer system were then used to detect mip protein of L. pneumophila within each hospital water sample. The results were obtained from culturing and PCR compared to each other. The water samples that analyzed in this study were collected from hospitals and medical institution located in different parts of the city. Legionella were isolated from the total of 30 water samples (22. 7 %). The mip based primer sets by amplicon size of 630 bp detected Legionella genome from approximately (37 %) of the culture positive samples that indicating they could be considered as L. pneumophila. The results showed that the risk of nosocomial legionellosis could not be excluded from the city hospitals due to significant contamination of the hospital water supplies.

All samples were filtered and inoculated into semi-solid Ellinghausen and McCullough modified by Johnson and Harris (EMJH) media supplemented with additional 5 -fluorouracil. The cultures were then incubated at 30 °C and observed under a dark field microscope with intervals of 10 days. A PCR assay targeting the rrs gene was used to confirm the genus Leptospira among the isolates. Subsequently, the pathogenic status of the isolates was determined using primer sets G 1 /G 2 and Sapro 1 /Sapro 2, which target the secY and rrs genes, respectively. The isolates were identified at serogroup level using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) while their genetic diversity was assessed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Based on dark field microscopy, 23. 1 % (28 / 121) water and 23. 3 % (7 / 30) soil cultures were positive for Leptospira spp. Of the 35 positive cultures, only 8 were pure and confirmed as Leptospira genus by PCR assay.

Approximately 125 agricultural use AIs served as the base set of pesticides for this surface <b>water</b> <b>screening</b> procedure. Sufficient aquatic toxicity data were available to classify 39 of these AIs into 5 broad relative aquatic toxicity categories ranging from “very low ” to “very high. ” Spatial and temporal characteristics of agricultural pesticide use for the 23 AIs with the highest aquatic toxicity ranking were determined from analysis of recent agricultural use data.

40|$|Environmental estrogens are {{environmental}} contaminants {{that can}} mimic the biological {{activities of the}} female hormone estrogen in the endocrine system, i. e. they act as endocrine disrupters. Several substances are reported to have estrogen-like activity or estrogenic activity. These include steroid hormones, synthetic estrogens (xenoestrogens), environmental pollutants and phytoestrogens (plant estrogens). Using the chromogenic substrate ortho-nitrophenyl-{beta}-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG) we show that an estrogen-sensitive yeast strain RMY/ER-ERE, with human estrogen receptor (hER{alpha}) gene and the lacZ gene which encodes the enzyme {beta}-galactosidase, is able to detect estrogenic activity in water samples {{over a wide range}} of spiked concentrations of the hormonal estrogen 17 {beta}-estradiol (E 2). Ortho-nitrophenol (ONP), the yellow product of this assay can be detected using spectrophotometry but requires cell lysis to release the enzyme and allow product formation. We improved this aspect in a fluorogenic assay by using fluorescein di-{beta}-D-galactopyranoside (FDG) as a substrate. The product was visualized using fluorescence microscopy without the need to kill, fix or lyse the cells. We show that in live yeast cells, the uptake of E 2 and the subsequent production of {beta}-galactosidase enzyme occur quite rapidly, with maximum enzyme-catalyzed fluorescent product formation evident after about 30 minutes of exposure to E 2. The fluorogenic assay was applied to a selection of estrogenic compounds and the Synchrotron-based Fourier transform infrared (SR-FTIR) spectra of the cells obtained to better understand the yeast whole cell response to the compounds. The fluorogenic assay is most sensitive to E 2, but the SR-FTIR spectra suggest that the cells respond to all the estrogenic compounds tested even when no fluorescent response was detected. These findings are promising and may shorten the duration of environmental <b>water</b> <b>screening</b> and monitoring regimes using yeast-based estrogen assays, and the development of biosensors for environmental estrogens designed to complement quantification methods...|$|E

The ability to integrate electrochemical sensor arrays with microfluidic devices nowadays provides possibilities for advanced lab-on-a-chip technology for the detection or quantification of multiple targets in a high-throughput approach. In particular, this is interesting for applications outside of analytical laboratories, such as point-of-care (POC) or on-site <b>water</b> <b>screening</b> where cost, measurement time, and the size of individual sensor devices are important factors to be considered. In addition, electrochemical sensor arrays can monitor biological processes in emerging cell-analysis platforms. Here, recent progress in the design of disease model systems and organ-on-a-chip technologies still needs to be matched by appropriate functionalities for application of external stimuli and read-out of cellular activity in long-term experiments. Preferably, data can be gathered not only at a singular location but at different spatial scales across a whole cell network, calling for new sensor array technologies. In this Account, we describe the evolution of chip-based nanoscale electrochemical sensor arrays, which have been developed and investigated in our group. Focusing on design and fabrication strategies that facilitate applications for the investigation of cellular networks, we emphasize the sensing of redox-active neurotransmitters on a chip. To this end, we address the impact of the device architecture on sensitivity, selectivity as well as on spatial and temporal resolution. Specifically, we highlight recent work on redox-cycling concepts using nanocavity sensor arrays, which provide an efficient amplification strategy for spatiotemporal detection of redox-active molecules. As redox-cycling electrochemistry critically depends on the ability to miniaturize and integrate closely spaced electrode systems, the fabrication of suitable nanoscale devices is of utmost importance for the development of this advanced sensor technology. Here, we address current challenges and limitations, which are associated with different redox cycling sensor array concepts and fabrication approaches. State-of-the-art micro- and nanofabrication technologies based on optical and electron-beam lithography allow precise control of the device layout and have led to a new generation of electrochemical sensor architectures for highly sensitive detection. Yet, these approaches are often expensive and limited to clean-room compatible materials. In consequence, they lack possibilities for upscaling to high-throughput fabrication at moderate costs. In this respect, self-assembly techniques can open new routes for electrochemical sensor design. This is true in particular for nanoporous redox cycling sensor arrays that have been developed in recent years and provide interesting alternatives to clean-room fabricated nanofluidic redox cycling devices. We conclude this Account with a discussion of emerging fabrication technologies based on printed electronics that we believe have the potential of transforming current redox cycling concepts from laboratory tools for fundamental studies and proof-of-principle analytical demonstrations into high-throughput devices for rapid screening applications...|$|E
