5|$|The Australian Cattle Dog {{thrives on}} change and new experiences, and many {{handlers}} find training the breed challenging for this reason. An Australian Cattle Dog can excel in obedience competition. It <b>will</b> <b>enjoy</b> the challenges, such as retrieving a scented article, but the breed's problem-solving ability may lead {{it to find}} solutions to problems that are not necessarily rewarded by the obedience judges. Rally obedience offers more interaction with the owner and less repetition than traditional obedience trials.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} been met with mixed reviews from critics, {{though it has}} {{regularly}} been noted that children <b>will</b> <b>enjoy</b> it. It was criticized for its camera and gameplay by publications such as IGN and GameSpot but was given a positive reception for its presentation and was well-received commercially, being the third best-selling game {{in the first two}} weeks of its release.

5|$|Balzac {{began using}} {{characters}} from earlier works in his 1835 novel Le Père Goriot, {{and made the}} technique a hallmark of his fiction. In the case of Z. Marcas, the narrator– Charles Rabourdin, whose identity is only revealed {{at the end of}} the story– is in fact the son of a central character from Balzac's 1837 tale La Femme supérieure. The title character of that story is married to Xavier Rabourdin, who is unjustly ignored for a promotion to the head of his civil service department. At the end of the La Femme supérieure, Rabourdin pledges to his wife that they <b>will</b> <b>enjoy</b> success in the world of business. His son's poverty in Z. Marcas is evidence of his failure.|$|E

5|$|The {{place where}} Ahalya is held to have practised her penance and was {{redeemed}} has been celebrated in scriptures as a sacred {{place called the}} Ahalya-tirtha. A tirtha is a sacred place with a body of water, where pilgrims generally bathe to purify themselves. The location of the Ahalya-tirtha is disputed: according to some scriptures, {{it is on the}} river Godavari, others place it on the river Narmada. Two sites are widely held to be the Ahalya-tirtha. One is located near Ahalyeshvara Temple in Bhalod, {{on the banks of the}} Narmada; another is located in Darbhanga district, Bihar. The Ahilya Asthan temple in Ahalya-gram ("Ahalya's village") in the same district is dedicated to Ahalya. For those seeking to attract women and be handsome like the love-god Kamadeva, the Matsya Purana and the Kurma Purana prescribe the worship of Ahalya at the Ahalya-tirtha. This is to be done on the day of Kamadeva, in the Hindu month of Chaitra. According to the texts, he who bathes in the tirtha <b>will</b> <b>enjoy</b> pleasure with the celestial nymphs.|$|E

25|$|Corchado y Juarbe was a {{supporter}} of the Spanish Revolución of 1868, believing that the Spanish colonies <b>will</b> <b>enjoy</b> more liberties with the establishment of the new regime. After the success of the revolution, which established a republican government, he was elected in 1871 to represent the District of Mayagüez and Puerto Rico before the Spanish Courts in Barcelona. Corchado y Juarbe made use of his position to denounce the use of capital punishment and voice his support of the new Spanish Constitution. He also delivered speeches in which he favored the improvement of social and economic conditions for the Spanish colonies. In 1875, the Spanish royal family returned to power and Corchado y Juarbe decided that it was too dangerous to continue in his political quest. In 1879, he returned to Puerto Rico.|$|E
25|$|Peace {{talks between}} the {{southern}} rebels and the government made substantial progress in 2003 and early 2004, although skirmishes {{in parts of the}} south have reportedly continued. The two sides have agreed that, following a final peace treaty, southern Sudan <b>will</b> <b>enjoy</b> autonomy for six years, and after the expiration of that period, the people of southern Sudan will be able to vote in a referendum on independence. Furthermore, oil revenues will be divided equally between the government and rebels during the six-year interim period. The ability or willingness of the government to fulfill these promises has been questioned by some observers, however, and the status of three central and eastern provinces was a point of contention in the negotiations. Some observers wondered whether hard line elements in the north would allow the treaty to proceed.|$|E
