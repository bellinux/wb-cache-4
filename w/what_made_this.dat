5|$|This {{dedication}} to reading and study might, in another boy, have been {{nothing more than}} a reaction to the impending examinations — but not in Jan's case. <b>What</b> <b>made</b> <b>this</b> particular episode revealing was that the books found under his bedclothes were largely unconnected with his studies. In Riebeek West he developed a lifelong habit, that of reading avidly outside the prescribed curriculum, seeking knowledge for its own sake.|$|E
25|$|On January 25, 2007, Lindsay rejoined her {{previous}} team, Botasspor Adana, and resumed playing in Turkey. They beat team Galatasaray in the team's own gym in Istanbul the following month. <b>What</b> <b>made</b> <b>this</b> win memorable {{was the team}} line-up. Amongst them were four WNBA players: Loree Moore, Nikki Teasley, Tangela Smith and Chantelle Anderson. Lindsay had only two points in 21 minutes, but she had nine rebounds in all.|$|E
25|$|<b>What</b> <b>made</b> <b>this</b> trial {{novel was}} that the {{subjects}} were randomly allocated to their test groups. The up-to-that-time practice was to allocate subjects alternately to each group, based on {{the order in which}} they presented for treatment. This practice could be biased, because those admitting each patient knew to which group that patient would be allocated (and so the decision to admit or not admit a specific patient might be influenced by the experimenter's knowledge of the nature of their illness, and their knowledge of the group to which they would occupy).|$|E

Shuch is a maker of metaphors, an existential explorer whose characters consider their place in the galaxy through poetic symbols." ...|$|R

25|$|Spiritualists often set March 31, 1848 as the {{beginning}} of their movement. On that date, Kate and Margaret Fox, of Hydesville, reported that they had made contact with the spirit of a murdered peddler. <b>What</b> <b>made</b> <b>this</b> an extraordinary event was that the spirit communicated through audible rapping noises, rather than simply appearing to a person in a trance. The evidence of the senses appealed to practical Americans, and the Fox sisters became a sensation. Demonstrations of mediumship (seances and automatic writing, for example) proved to be a profitable business, and soon became popular forms of entertainment and spiritual catharsis. The Foxes earned a living this way, as did many others.|$|E
25|$|The University of Southern California Trojans {{returned}} to the Rose Bowl Game presented by Citi in the first BCS game of 2007 on New Year's Day in Pasadena, California. Historically, the Rose Bowl has pitted the Pac-10 and Big Ten regular season champions. The Pac-10 champion Trojans played in a non-traditional Rose Bowl matchup with the University of Michigan Wolverines. <b>What</b> <b>made</b> <b>this</b> game a not-so-traditional matchup is that Michigan entered as the runner-up of the Big Ten, as the Big Ten champions Ohio State instead participated in the BCS Championship Game due to their No. 1 national ranking. Thanks to their win, the Trojans now hold a 6–2 lead in their eight meetings against the Wolverines in Pasadena.|$|E
25|$|The Mali Empire {{covered a}} larger {{area for a}} longer period of time than any other West African state before or since. <b>What</b> <b>made</b> <b>this</b> {{possible}} was the decentralised nature of administration throughout the state. According to Burkinabé writer Joseph Ki-Zerbo, the farther a person travelled from Niani, the more decentralised the mansas power became. Nevertheless, the mansa managed to keep tax money and nominal control over the area without agitating his subjects into revolt. At the local level (village, town and city), kun-tiguis elected a dougou-tigui (village-master) from a bloodline descended from that locality's semi-mythical founder. The county level administrators called kafo-tigui (county-master) were appointed by the governor of the province from within his own circle. Only at the state or province level was there any palpable interference from the central authority in Niani. Provinces picked their own governors via their own custom (election, inheritance, etc.). Regardless of their title in the province, they were recognised as dyamani-tigui (province master) by the mansa. Dyamani-tiguis had to be approved by the mansa and were subject to his oversight. If the mansa didn’t believe the dyamani-tigui was capable or trustworthy, a farba might be installed to oversee the province or administer it outright.|$|E

In a brief review for Newsday, Glenn Gamboa {{said it was a}} [...] "testament" [...] to the group's talent that they can [...] "turn essentially a transition album into something that sounds this good". PopMatters reviewer Kiel Hauck wrote that Lazzara and Nolan's call-and-response vocals, featured on the group's debut, were placed [...] "perfect throughout the record" [...] as the pair [...] "create a beautiful combination that serves as a reminder of <b>what</b> <b>made</b> <b>this</b> band so special in the first place". Tori Pederson of Punknews.org {{said the group}} [...] "sound like a well-oiled machine here," [...] producing [...] "arguably the best album of their career" [...] in the process.

500|$|The Model 1897 {{was popular}} before World War I, {{but it was}} after the war broke out that sales of the Model 1897 picked up. This was because many were {{produced}} {{to meet the demands of}} the military. When the United States entered World War I, there was a need for more service weapons to be issued to the troops. It became clear to the United States just how brutal trench warfare was, and how great the need was for a large amount of close-range firepower while fighting in a trench, after they had observed the war for the first three years. The Model 1897 Trench grade was an evolution of this idea. The pre-existing Winchester Model 1897 was modified by adding a perforated steel heat shield over the barrel which protected the hand of the user from the barrel when it became over-heated, and an adapter with bayonet lug for affixing an M1917 bayonet. [...] This model was ideal for close combat and was efficient in trench warfare due to its 20-inch cylinder bore barrel. Buckshot ammunition was issued with the trench grade during the war. Each round of this ammunition contained nine 00 (.33-caliber) buckshot pellets. This gave considerable firepower to the individual soldier by each round that was fired. [...] This shorter barrel and large amount of firepower is <b>what</b> <b>made</b> <b>this</b> grade ideal for trench warfare.|$|E

The squadron {{was stationed}} behind Fort Sumter {{in order to stop}} any Union ships that made it past the obstructions. <b>What</b> <b>made</b> <b>this</b> flotilla unusual, and hence its appellation of [...] "special", was that the boats were armed with spar torpedoes, a highly controversial weapon of war that some considered [...] "uncivilized". Webb assembled this squadron with a few cutters and a lot of canoes and skiffs, all armed with 20-foot long poles with a 60-pound torpedo.|$|E
2500|$|The spiritual {{orientation}} of the struggle with the world {{has given rise to}} the secular movements of emancipation in the modern world, and it is here that Unger sees the religion of the future. The problem Unger sees, however, is that as an established religion, this orientation has betrayed its ideological underpinnings and has made peace with existing order. It has accepted the hierarchies of class structure in society, accepted the transfer of money as serving as the basis of solidarity, and reaffirmed the basis of existing political, economic, and social institutions by investing in a conservative position of their preservation. Thus, [...] "to be faithful to <b>what</b> <b>made</b> <b>this</b> orientation persuasive and powerful in the first place, we must radicalize it against both established institutions and dominant beliefs." ...|$|E

2500|$|I {{honestly}} thought after Ligonier that we {{were beginning}} {{a new era of}} cooperation and Orthodox unity on this continent. For {{the first time since the}} early years of our presence in the Americas, it seemed there was a common vision, or at least a common goal of working together, not just for the sake of working together, but toward a canonically proper end of a unified Church. For me, the chance to sit down with brother bishops, many of whom I had never met, was a great and awesome experience. <b>What</b> <b>made</b> <b>this</b> experience great and awesome, besides just getting [...] together, was that [...] there was a purpose. Often we had gotten together in the past, but just for social purposes or anniversaries, celebrations, etc. This time it was for the good of the Church. Unfortunately, [...] what happened in the aftermath of Ligonier left us further apart and more disunited than we were in the years that led up to that historic gathering.|$|E
2500|$|The {{epidemic}} of foot-and-mouth {{disease in the}} United Kingdom {{in the spring and}} summer of 2001 was caused by the [...] "Type O pan Asia" [...] strain of the disease. This episode resulted in more than 2,000 cases of the disease in farms throughout the British countryside. Around ten million sheep and cattle were killed in an eventually successful attempt to halt the disease. The county of Cumbria was the most seriously affected area of the country, with 843 cases. By the time the disease was halted in October 2001, the crisis was estimated to have cost Britain £8 billion ($13 billion) to the agricultural and support industries, and to the outdoor industry. <b>What</b> <b>made</b> <b>this</b> outbreak so serious was the amount of time between infection being present at the first outbreak locus, and the time when countermeasures were put into operation against the disease, such as transport bans and detergent washing of both vehicles and personnel entering livestock areas. The epidemic was probably caused by pigs which had been fed infected rubbish that had not been properly heat-sterilized. Further, the rubbish is believed to have contained remains of infected meat that had been illegally imported to Britain.|$|E
2500|$|Later in 1967, as {{a direct}} {{reaction}} to Seale's realistic production, Gerald Freedman directed a performance for Joseph Papp's Shakespeare Festival at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park, Manhattan, starring Jack Hollander as Titus, Olympia Dukakis as Tamora, Moses Gunn as Aaron and Erin Martin as Lavinia. Freedman had seen Seale's production and felt it failed because it worked by [...] "bringing into play our sense of reality in terms of detail and literal time structure." [...] He argued that when presented realistically, the play simply doesn't work, as it raises too many practical question, such as why does Lavinia not bleed to death, why does Marcus not {{take her to the}} hospital immediately, why does Tamora not notice that the pie tastes unusual, exactly how do both Martius and Quintus manage to fall into a hole? Freedman argued that [...] "if one wants to create a fresh emotional response to the violence, blood and multiple mutilations of Titus Andronicus, one must shock the imagination and subconscious with visual images that recall the richness and depth of primitive rituals." [...] As such, the costumes were purposely designed to represent no particular time or place but were instead based on those of the Byzantine Empire and Feudal Japan. Additionally, the violence was stylised; instead of swords and daggers, wands were used and no contact was ever made. The colour scheme was hallucinatory, changing mid-scene. Characters wore classic masks of comedy and tragedy. The slaughter in the final scene was accomplished symbolically by having each character wrapped in a red robe as they died. A narrator was also used (played by Charles Dance), who, prior to each act, would announce {{what was going to happen}} in the upcoming act, thus undercutting any sense of realism. The production received generally positive reviews, with Mildred Kuner arguing [...] "Symbolism rather than gory realism was <b>what</b> <b>made</b> <b>this</b> production so stunning." ...|$|E
