30|$|The {{oil palm}} empty fruit bunch (OPEFB) {{is part of}} the wastes {{generated}} from the preliminary steps for processing oil palm mill which involves removing the fruits from its bunches by a combined unit of sterilizer and rotary <b>drum</b> <b>thresher</b> (Kwasi 2002; Katamanee 2006). Oil palm cultivation cut across all the nine states of Niger Delta (Akwa Ibom, Abia, Rivers, Edo, Imo, Ondo, Bayelsa, Cross River and Delta) (PIND 2011). Palm oil mills produce a large amount of solid wastes. The remainder of the oil palm consists of huge amount of lignocellulosic materials such as oil palm fronds, trunks, palm kernel and empty fruit bunches. The residues contain 7.0 million tonnes of oil palm trunks, 26.2 million tonnes of oil palm fronds and 23 % of empty fruit bunch (EFB) per tonne of fresh fruit bunch (FFB) processed in oil palm mill. These residues may cause environmental pollution problems and spread diseases (Udoetok 2012).|$|R

Four straw walkers with an overall width of 1250 mm and a total length of 2400 mm separate the remaining grain from the straw. The grain is cleaned twice with sieves measuring 920 mm × 1070 mm. An elevator transports the cleaned grain to a sorting cylinder on the roof. It sorts three quality grades of grain. For some fruit types, special sorting sieves were offered.|$|R

It was 1.5 m high by 3m wide by 0.5m deep and used simple circuits, with approximately 1000 ex-Government thermionic valves (vacuum tubes) mainly 6J6s which were B7G-based double triodes. The memory consisted of a 5.5 inch mm diameter, 1 inch mm <b>wide</b> <b>drum</b> rotating at 3000 rpm containing 32 tracks each storing sixteen 32-bit words giving a total of 2kilobytes. The drum had a special track from which the electronics were clocked. The machine had an accumulator and a multiplier register which were arranged to allow double length multiplication. As the multiplicand was repeatedly added to the product, it got longer while the multiplier got shorter so that the product could fill the accumulator and then continue into the multiplier register. Multiplication took up to 640ms for a 32-bit multiplier, which needed 32 drum accesses.|$|R

The concept of the thresher emanated from the working principles of a throw-in axial flow thresher a peg type threshing mechanism and a screw type threshing mechanism. Components of the thresher were designed and a prototype was made. The power requirement of the thresher was evaluated and validated with the power thresher standards of the Institute of Agricultural Machinery Japan which recommends an average power requirement of 3. 5 PS or less.

50|$|Any {{classical}} dome built since Michelangelo's must {{expect to}} be compared to it, and Gilbert's dome is a frank homage, with interesting differences. His drawings show that he originally planned a <b>wider</b> <b>drum</b> and, correspondingly, a more massive dome. The smaller dome as built could be criticized by some as too small. It is smaller than St. Peter's and has a simplified design: single columns round the upper lantern instead of double ones, for instance. The ribs on the capitol dome are less pronounced than those on St. Peter's, {{but they are still}} visually apparent. Gilbert knew that St. Peter's dome was on the edge of being unstable: it had cracked and had to be reinforced. His engineer for this project, Gunvald Aus, bound the brick dome in reinforcing steel bands, and Gilbert crowned the paired columns round the drum (which act as buttresses to counter the dome's weight) with additional stone. Other than St. Peter's, additional buildings with marble domes include the Taj Mahal in India, and the Rhode Island State House in the city of Providence.|$|R

40|$|A {{commercial}} {{drum chipper}} was fed alternately and piecewise with poplar stems and poplar tops, {{in order to}} determine the effect of piece size and tree part on machine performance. Chipping stems required most of the available power (231 kW) delivered by the tractor, whereas chipping tops took about half that much. However, productivity was twice as high with stems, compared to tops (i. e. 25 and 11 t h− 1 of oven dry wood, respectively). As a consequence, specific fuel consumption per unit product was 15 % lower with stems, compared to tops – i. e. 0. 61 and 0. 72 L m− 3, respectively. Mean feeding speed was 0. 37 m s− 1 for stems and 0. 41 m s− 1 for tops, but the difference was not significant (p = 0. 1677). Productivity and fuel consumption were strongly related to piece size, but tree part had its own additional effect, independent from size and possibly related to form. When chipping tops it is advisable to feed more pieces at a time, in order to partly compensate for the effect of piece size. Operators expecting to chip primarily small-size materials may acquire special chipper versions with <b>wider</b> <b>drums</b> and additional side rollers, for smoother mass feeding...|$|R
