40|$|The {{main goal}} of the {{bachelor}} thesis "Basics of financial literacy for children in school-age with mental disabilities in Montessori pedagogy" {{is to create an}} instructional material for financial literacy in Montessori pedagogy. The research determines four partial goals. The research question is chosen according to the partial goals. The qualitative research techniques were used to the achievement of the goals of the bachelor thesis. The semi-structured interview, the participant observation and <b>the</b> individual work <b>with</b> <b>the</b> girls were used to collect data for the practical part. The result of the bachelor thesis is the formed instructional materials for teaching financial literacy including <b>the</b> handmade <b>aids</b> of Montessori pedagogy. The instructional materials, including <b>the</b> <b>aids,</b> was created during the research and based on the individual needs of the girls. The results of the research point out <b>the</b> work <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>aids</b> beeing helpful for both girls. It was proceeded systematically during <b>the</b> work <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>aids.</b> Both girls improved, especially {{in the area of the}} financial literacy. Each of the girls improved according their individual abilities. Therefore it is not possible to compare the results of the research. The improvement of both girls in the area of the financial literacy is recorded in case studies. All process of <b>the</b> work <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>aids</b> and <b>the</b> practise work <b>with</b> money is described in the instructional materials. The bachelor thesis can serve as inspiration for the production of other <b>aids</b> in <b>the</b> area of the financial literacy, or for the completion and the grow of the instructional materials...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} prevent low back pain (LBP) during dishwashing, we {{developed}} three types of aid with a thick cushion for supporting the shins and evaluated the effects of <b>the</b> standing <b>aid</b> on <b>the</b> subjective discomfort and muscle activities. Nine female volunteers were asked to wash plates in each of four working postures: (a) without <b>the</b> standing <b>aid,</b> (b) <b>with</b> <b>the</b> round type of <b>aid,</b> (c) <b>with</b> <b>the</b> small rectangular type of <b>aid,</b> and (d) <b>with</b> <b>the</b> large rectangular type of <b>aid.</b> <b>With</b> <b>the</b> three types of <b>aid,</b> <b>the</b> subjects were instructed to support <b>the</b> shins <b>with</b> <b>the</b> standing <b>aid</b> and to support <b>the</b> abdomen <b>with</b> <b>the</b> edge of a kitchen counter. In <b>the</b> three postures <b>with</b> <b>the</b> standing <b>aid,</b> 21. 5 ± 10. 0 % of the weight was supported <b>with</b> <b>the</b> standing <b>aid</b> and <b>the</b> kitchen counter. The subjective discomfort was milder and the muscle activity level in the low back was lower in <b>the</b> three postures <b>with</b> <b>the</b> standing <b>aid</b> than in <b>the</b> posture without <b>the</b> <b>aid.</b> It was thought that the round type of aid {{would be more effective}} in decreasing the discomfort in many of body regions and the muscle load on the low back than either of the rectangular types of aid. Therefore, it was suggested that <b>the</b> standing <b>aid</b> had <b>the</b> desired effect in decreasing discomfort and muscle load on the low back during dishwashing...|$|R
