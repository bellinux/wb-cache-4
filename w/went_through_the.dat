In the early 1900s, the main {{industries in the}} creek's watershed included agriculture, furniture factories, flour mills, and brick works. The tributary Spruce Run was also used as a water supply by the White Deer Mountain Water Company and the main stem was used as power for some small gristmills. During this time period, major communities in the watershed included Lewisburg (3085 people), Mifflinburg (1559 people), Mazeppa (185 people), Cowan (150 people), Buffalo Roads (142 people), and Kelly Point (97 people).

A team of coaches <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> video footage shot by videographer Sambhu of the National Institute of Sports, Patiala, and studied the technique of the boxers from various countries in detail, so as to prepare Vijender and the others regarding the opponent's manoeuvres and fighting techniques.|$|E
5|$|As the 1992 Kansas City Chiefs season began, the team's {{first big}} move was {{the signing of}} quarterback Dave Krieg to compete with DeBerg and Vlasic.

The Chiefs went into {{training}} camp and <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> preseason with Krieg, Vlasic, and rookie draft pick Matt Blundin. Krieg ended up playing every snap of the season, leaving both Vlasic without a year's worth of playing time as his contract expired.

5|$|Following Dunmore's War, Richard Henderson, a {{prominent}} judge from North Carolina, hired Boone {{to travel to}} the Cherokee towns in present North Carolina and Tennessee and inform them of an upcoming meeting.

Afterwards, Henderson hired Boone to blaze {{what became known as the}} Wilderness Road, which <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Cumberland Gap and into central Kentucky. Along with a party of about 30 workers, Boone marked a path to the Kentucky River, where he founded Boonesborough. Other settlements, notably Harrodsburg, were also established at this time. Despite occasional Indian attacks, Boone returned to the Clinch Valley and brought his family and other settlers to Boonesborough on September 8, 1775.|$|E

5|$|For {{much of the}} Middle Ages, England's climate {{differed}} from that in the 21st century. Between the 9th and 13th centuries England <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Medieval Warm Period, a prolonged period of warmer temperatures; in the early 13th century, for example, summers were around 1°C warmer than today and the climate was slightly drier. These warmer temperatures allowed poorer land to be brought into cultivation and for grapevines to be cultivated relatively far north. The Warm Period was followed by several centuries of much cooler temperatures, termed the Little Ice Age; by the 14th century spring temperatures had dropped considerably, reaching their coldest in the 1340s and 1350s. This cold end to the Middle Ages significantly affected English agriculture and living conditions.|$|E

As a result, by September 1956, only 33 of 1310 applications by ex-Waffen-SS officers had been accepted (making them 0.4% of the Bundeswehr's officer corps), as compared to 195 of 462 applications by enlisted men.|$|E

After a close win over Glenn Howard in the round robin, Martin dropped a 4–5 decision to Howard after he missed a crucial shot in the 3 vs. 4 game of the playoffs, and he lost the bronze medal game to Brad Gushue 10–5, playing without second Marc Kennedy, because Kennedy and his wife were expecting a child. Martin finished the 2010–11 season by winning his record 7th Players' Championship.|$|E

5|$|On May 28, Bonds passed Ruth, {{hitting his}} 715th career home run to center field off Colorado Rockies pitcher Byung-hyun Kim. The ball was hit an {{estimated}} 445feet (140m) into center field where it <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> hands of several fans but then fell onto an elevated platform in center field. Then it {{rolled off the}} platform where Andrew Morbitzer, a 38-year-old San Francisco resident, caught the ball {{while he was in}} line at a concession stand. Mysteriously, radio broadcaster Dave Flemming's radio play-by-play of the home run went silent just as the ball was hit, apparently from a microphone failure. But the televised version, called by Giants broadcaster Duane Kuiper, was not affected.|$|E

Ted Devey, Tommy Hands, Billy Ollis and Wheldon were ever-present in the League, all but Devey for the second season running, and Caesar Jenkyns missed only the two games for which he was suspended.|$|E
