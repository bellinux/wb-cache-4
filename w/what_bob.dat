5|$|Bob {{finds the}} action and higher pay rejuvenating; he begins {{rigorous}} training while awaiting more work from Mirage {{for the next two}} months. Discovering a tear in his suit, he visits superhero costume designer Edna Mode. Mode, assuming that Helen knows <b>what</b> <b>Bob</b> is doing, makes new suits for the entire family. However, she rejects Bob's request for a cape, citing the large number of Supers who perished when their capes got caught in something.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Helen visits Edna and learns <b>what</b> <b>Bob</b> {{has been}} up to. Edna {{activates}} a beacon she built into the suits so Helen can find Bob, inadvertently causing him to be discovered and captured. Helen borrows a private plane to head for Nomanisan, but Violet and Dash have stowed away wearing their own suits, leaving Jack-Jack with a babysitter. Syndrome shoots down Helen's plane, but she and the children survive and reach the island. When Bob is informed that his family is dead, he grabs and threatens to kill Mirage, but relents when Syndrome calls his bluff.|$|E
25|$|The {{conflict}} between <b>what</b> <b>Bob</b> had become, {{and what he}} saw himself as, led him to be impulsively inclined to follow the lead set by the more headstrong Terry, who led them recklessly into one scrape after another. Bob usually blamed his drinking, heavy smoking, poor diet and reckless behaviour on Terry, a view Audrey and Thelma only too willingly agreed with. This may have been true in part, but actually Bob needed little persuasion to stay out drinking with Terry or to behave accordingly.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{introduced}} two new {{characters in}} Gibson Praise, played by Jeff Gulka, and Diana Fowley, portrayed by Mimi Rogers. Kim Manners later said of Gulka, [...] "There {{was something about}} that kid's personality that really came off on screen. He really exuded an intelligence that was pretty special. Chris saw <b>what</b> <b>Bob</b> Goodwin did {{with him and he}} knew that this kid was a special storytelling tool for the chronicle of the X-Files". Chris Carter said that Fowley [...] "was a character you were destined to hate because she was a competitor for Mulder's affection with Scully. Gillian Anderson said, [...] "She didn't make it easy on Scully. I think she was aware of her effect on Mulder and on the situation." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Brother from Another Series" [...] is {{the sixteenth}} episode of The Simpsons eighth season. It {{originally}} aired on the Fox {{network in the}} United States on February 23, 1997. Sideshow Bob is released from prison into the care of his brother Cecil and {{claims to be a}} changed man. However, Bart does not believe him and tries to find out <b>what</b> <b>Bob</b> is up to. It was the first episode directed by Pete Michels and was written by Ken Keeler. The episode guest stars Kelsey Grammer in his sixth appearance as Sideshow Bob and David Hyde Pierce as Cecil. The title is not only a pun on the movie The Brother from Another Planet (used for a previous episode as well), but also a reference to the fact that guest stars Kelsey Grammer (Frasier Crane) and David Hyde Pierce (Niles Crane) also played bickering brothers on the NBC sitcom Frasier.|$|E

Repackaged {{on several occasions}} under various names such as The Party Album and Slade's Crazee Christmas; it contained re-recorded Slade hits and songs that had been successful for other artists. Amazed at <b>what</b> <b>Bob</b> Geldof had achieved with Live Aid, Holder penned the lyrics to [...] "Do You Believe in Miracles" [...] which was also released in November.

6000|$|For {{the life}} of him Mike could not help giggling as he pictured <b>what</b> <b>Bob's</b> {{expression}} must have been when his brother read this document. But the humorous side of the thing did not appeal to him for long. What should he say to <b>Bob?</b> <b>What</b> would <b>Bob</b> say to him? Dash it all, it made him look such an awful ass! Anyhow, Bob couldn't do much. In fact he didn't see {{that he could do}} anything. The team was filled up, and Burgess was not likely to alter it. Besides, why should he alter it? Probably he would have given Bob his colours anyhow. Still, it was beastly awkward. Marjory meant well, but she had put her foot right in it. Girls oughtn't to meddle with these things. No girl ought to be taught to write till she came of age. And Uncle John had behaved in many respects like the Complete Rotter. If he was going to let out things like that, he might at least have whispered them, or looked behind the curtains to see that the place wasn't chock-full of female kids. Confound Uncle John! ...|$|R

60|$|Nobody was there, and, sitting down, she {{wondered}} <b>what</b> <b>Bob</b> had really meant by his words. It was too dreadful {{to think that}} he intended to go straight away to sea without seeing her again, and frightened at what she had done she waited anxiously for his return.|$|E
