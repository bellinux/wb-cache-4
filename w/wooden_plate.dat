25|$|The Samaritans {{interpret}} the deuteronomic commandment to mean displaying any select text from the Samaritan {{version of the}} five Books of Moses. This can contain a blessing or a particularly holy or uplifting message. In the past they placed a stone plaque inscribed with the Ten Commandments above the house door, some examples {{dating back to the}} Byzantine (4th-7th century) and Early Muslim (7th-11th century) periods being now shown in the Israel Museum in Jerusalem. Nowadays a Samaritan mezuzah is usually made of either marble, a <b>wooden</b> <b>plate,</b> or a sheet of parchment or high quality paper, on which they inscribe select verses from the Samaritan Torah. This they place either above the house door, or inside the house, in the entrance hall or at a prominent place on a large wall. These mezuzot are found in every Samaritan household {{as well as in the}} synagogue. Today some Samaritans would also use a Jewish-style mezuzah case and place inside it a small written Samaritan scroll, i.e. a text from the Samaritan Torah, written in the Samaritan alphabet. The more such mezuzot there are in the house, the better it is considered to be.|$|E
2500|$|On the Leeds and Liverpool Canal {{there is}} a variety of {{different}} lock gear. Some paddles are raised by turning what is in effect a large horizontal wing nut (butterfly nut) lifting a screw-threaded bar attached {{to the top of the}} paddle. Others are operated by lifting a long wooden lever, which operates a <b>wooden</b> <b>plate</b> which seals the culvert. These are known locally as [...] "jack cloughs". Bottom gate paddles are sometimes operated by a horizontal ratchet which also slides a <b>wooden</b> <b>plate</b> sideways, rather than the more common vertical lift. Many of these idiosyncratic paddles have been [...] "modernised" [...] and they are becoming rare.|$|E
2500|$|Skiffs have fixed {{rather than}} sliding seats, and the blades {{are held in}} thole pins {{at the side of}} the boat rather than outriggers. The blades are made of wood with leather collars and {{traditional}} spoons. Pressure is applied by the feet against an adjustable <b>wooden</b> <b>plate</b> known as a [...] "stretcher board". Skiffs are usually [...] "Singles" [...] with one sculler, or [...] "Doubles" [...] with two scullers (one behind the other) and a cox. However skiffs with more scullers or incorporating a sail are also used. Skiffing takes place in the Netherlands and Argentina, using the design of traditional Thames skiff although Argentinian skiffs usually have outriggers instead of tholes.|$|E

50|$|The story {{continues}} with the Gothic (Getic) King Antyrus, {{also known as}} Dromihete, being approached by Lisimachus, former general of Alexander the Great who wanted to conquer Dacia for its gold and rich land. However, Dromihete (Antyrus) defeated and captured Lisimachus. Instead of killing Lisimachus, Dromihete invited Lisimachus and his generals {{to sit down and}} eat all together. The meal for Lisimachus and his generals was served in gold plates whilst the meal for Dromihete and his men in <b>wooden</b> <b>plates.</b> When Lisimachus asked why he chose <b>wooden</b> <b>plates,</b> Dromihete answers that it was just to show Lisimachus his generosity for everyone coming as a guest-visitor. By eating from the <b>wooden</b> <b>plates,</b> Dromihete wanted to show that there was nothing of value in Dacia.|$|R
2500|$|In a {{story told}} by Dominic Charlie in 1965, he related {{about the first}} origins of his people. Their very first {{ancestor}} was a man named X̱i7lánexw , translated as The First One. He {{was born in a}} village near Squamish, British Columbia. [...] X̱i7lánexw [...] did not know that his wife was with child, but he knew that someone or something was coming. He knew of something coming because of a bird that goes ahead of three supernatural men. These three men, called the Transformers, told the Rave, [...] "You go tell everybody we are coming." [...] The first man understand the bird and he responded by getting ready with his canoe. Near the mouth of the Cheakamus River, is a small mountain, and a little bay that fit his canoe. He tied his canoe here and took out his pole, a long shaft used to pull along the river. He put moss around the pole, then placed the pole down. So when the fish touch the pole, their slime was wiped on the moss. He knew that the Transformers were coming further down river. He grabbed the pole and waited for a fish to touch it, then would pull out the pole and see where the salmon touched. He took the slime {{and put it in a}} <b>wooden</b> <b>plate</b> and put his pole down again. Then he heard the three brothers coming. Then the apocalypse came.|$|E
2500|$|Galician cuisine often uses {{fish and}} shellfish. The {{empanada}} is a meat or fish pie, with a bread-like base, top and crust with the meat or fish filling usually {{being in a}} tomato sauce including onions and garlic. Caldo galego is a hearty soup whose main ingredients are potatoes and a local vegetable named grelo (Broccoli rabe). The latter is also employed in Lacón con grelos, a typical carnival dish, consisting of pork shoulder boiled with grelos, potatoes and chorizo. Centolla {{is the equivalent of}} king crab. It is prepared by being boiled alive, having its main body opened like a shell, and then having its innards mixed vigorously. Another popular dish is octopus, boiled (traditionally in a copper pot) and served in a <b>wooden</b> <b>plate,</b> cut into small pieces and laced with olive oil, sea salt and pimentón (Spanish paprika). This dish is called Pulpo a la gallega or in Galician [...] "Polbo á Feira", which roughly translates as [...] "Galician-style Octopus". There are several regional varieties of cheese. The best-known one is the so-called tetilla, named after its breast-like shape. Other highly regarded varieties include the San Simón cheese from Vilalba and the creamy cheese produced in the Arzúa-Ulloa area. A classical dessert is filloas, crêpe-like pancakes made with flour, broth or milk, and eggs. When cooked at a pig slaughter festival, they may also contain the animal's blood. A famous almond cake called Tarta de Santiago (St. James' cake) is a Galician sweet speciality mainly produced in Santiago de Compostela and all around Galicia.|$|E

60|$|Taking Martin {{round to}} the back of the shed, Barney showed him a row of troughs, about three feet square, close to the edge of a pond of water. These troughs are called bacos. In front of each stood a Negro slave up to his knees in water. Each had a <b>wooden</b> <b>plate,</b> with which he dashed water upon the rough cascalho as it was thrown into the trough by another slave. By this means, and by {{stirring}} it with a small hoe, the earth and sand are washed away. Two overseers were closely watching the process; for it is during this part of the operation that the largest diamonds are found. These overseers were seated on elevated seats, each being armed with a long leathern whip, to keep a sharp look-out, for the slaves are expert thieves.|$|E

30|$|Compressed <b>wooden</b> <b>plates</b> and dowels {{were used}} to connect members in post-and-beam {{structures}} {{as a substitute for}} a steel fastener. In order {{to take advantage of the}} characteristic properties of compressed wood and to achieve optimum joint performance, two compressed <b>wooden</b> <b>plates</b> were used in each joint to give multiple shear planes for each compressed wooden dowel. Consequently, this type of joint showed very good properties in pull-out and momen-trotation performance, and its engineering design could be further optimized. This joint is expected to be introduced to many kinds of structural systems, including long-span frame structures made of domestic timber found in Japanese residential houses.|$|R

50|$|A torpedo is {{released}} {{at a speed}} greater than 160 knots (or 300 km/h, 184 mph) {{in the air and}} then follows a parabolic path free-falling to the water. The aerodynamically designed <b>wooden</b> <b>plates</b> stabilize the up-and-down motion of the torpedo in the air keeping it aligned to the diving course. The <b>wooden</b> <b>plates</b> are shed as the torpedo hits the water, and the elevators or horizontal rudders set farthest forward lift the nose of the torpedo after water entry to start level running. The structure is simple and works well. The wooden head cap had been used before the anti-rolling controller system was introduced.|$|R
