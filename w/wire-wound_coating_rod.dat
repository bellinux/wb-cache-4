A number of emerging applications like flexible electronic devices and displays and patterned microfluidic devices require selective deposition of material on micro- and nanoscale patterns. At these length scales, mathematical models with appropriate simplifying assumptions would prove handy to understand liquid dewetting mechanisms in coating and printing processes. For example, the liquid films in many coating and printing processes may {{be assumed to}} be thin enough so that intermolecular forces are important and the lubrication approximation can be invoked. Using a combination of nonlinear simulations and linear stability analysis, three important problems pertaining to coating and printing on chemically patterned surfaces are examined. The first problem {{is concerned with the}} liquid displacement phenomenon that occurs in lithographic printing processes. The model allows us to obtain physical insights into and numerical estimates of the smallest and largest feature sizes that can be printed, as well as the minimum spacing between feature sizes that can be tolerated. In addition, the model provides insights into experimental observations on a closely related process, <b>wire-wound</b> <b>rod</b> <b>coating</b> on chemically patterned surfaces. Next, the model is used to examine the effect of shear on the liquid displacement process. Linear theory reveals that the growth rate of interfacial perturbations has an imaginary component, indicating the existence of traveling waves. Nonlinear simulations show that shear delays interfacial rupture, and suppression of rupture occurs beyond a critical shear rate. Propagation of traveling waves along the interface, and subsequent weakening of van-der-Waals-driven dewetting, is found to be the cause of the rupture delay. Finally, the dewetting of a solitary liquid film resting on a chemically patterned surface, under the combined action of thermally induced Marangoni effects and the intermolecular forces is explored. The model results suggest that combined localized heating and cooling may be used to modify the film rupture dynamics induced by the disjoining forces and cause rupture at desired locations. This physical phenomenon provides a handle to deposit liquids on surfaces whose wettability is difficult to control. The work presented here has special practical relevance for manipulating liquid flow in industrial applications like templating, coating and printing processes, and microfluidics...|$|R

The influence of environmental factors (light, humidity, oxidation and heat) upon degradation of the drug in the coatings was investigated using liquid chromatography with evaporative light scattering detection and mass spectrometry. GS <b>coated</b> <b>rods</b> {{were found to be}} stable across the range of environments assessed, with only an oxidizing atmosphere resulting in significant changes to the gentamicin composition. In contrast, <b>rods</b> <b>coated</b> with GS/PLGA were more sensitive to storage conditions with compositional changes being detected after storage at 60 °C, 75 % relative humidity or exposure to light. The effect of γ-irradiation on the <b>coated</b> <b>rods</b> was also investigated and found to have no significant effect. Finally, liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis revealed that known gentamines C 1, C 1 a and C 2 were the major degradants formed.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{extensive}} {{research has been}} conducted on the strengthening of reinforced concrete (RC) structures using externally bonded fibre reinforced polymer (FRP). More recently, near-surface mounted (NSM) FRP reinforcement has attracted an increasing amount of research as well as practical applications. In the NSM method, grooves are first cut into the concrete cover of an RC element and the FRP reinforcement is bonded inside the groove with an appropriate filler (typically epoxy paste or cement grout). The FRP reinforcement is either prestressed or non-prestressed depending on the required level of strengthening. In all cases, the bond between an NSM bar and the substrate material {{plays a key role in}} ensuring the effectiveness of NSM strengthening. The present work investigated experimentally the bond behaviour of non-prestressed and prestressed beams reinforced with near surface mounted carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) bars under monotonic and fatigue loading. Forty concrete beams were cast and tested in seven groups. The test variables considered in this study were: presence of internal steel reinforcement or not, the type of CFRP rod (spirally wound or sand coated) and the prestressing force (non-prestressed or prestressed). Twenty eight beams were strengthened with non-prestressed CFRP rods; fifteen beams without internal steel reinforcement and thirteen beams with internal steel. Ten beams with internal steel were strengthened with prestressed CFRP rods. The beams were tested in four point bending. In each group, one beam was loaded monotonically. The remaining beams were loaded under different fatigue load levels. The minimum load was kept constant for all beams at 10 % of their monotonic capacity and the peak load was varied from one beam to another (denoted as a percentage of the peak load level). Twenty eight beams were strengthened with non-prestressed CFRP rods. Bond failures for the beams with and without internal steel, strengthened with CFRP rods and tested under monotonic or fatigue loads was by debonding between the CFRP rod and the epoxy that started at the loading point and as the load was increased or cycled, the debonding spread towards the support until failure occurred. A comparison of the fatigue life curves for the beams with and without steel, strengthened with CFRP rods revealed that the sand <b>coated</b> <b>rod</b> had better bond characteristics than the spirally wound rod (at the same load range the beam strengthened with sand <b>coated</b> <b>rod</b> had a longer life than the beam strengthened with spirally wound rod). Beams with internal steel, strengthened with CFRP rods and tested under fatigue loading failed in bond at high load levels (short fatigue lives) and by rupture of the steel rebar at low load levels (long fatigue lives). Ten beams with internal steel were strengthened with prestressed CFRP rods. The CFRP rods were prestressed to a force of 62 kN which corresponds to 45 % and 40 % of the monotonic capacity of the spirally wounded and sand <b>coated</b> <b>rods,</b> respectively. Almost all the beams with internal steel that were strengthened with prestressed CFRP rods failed by slipping between the CFRP rod and the epoxy that started at the support and propagated inwards towards the loading point. The exception to this was the beam strengthened with prestressed sand <b>coated</b> <b>rod</b> and tested under monotonic loading that failed by debonding between the CFRP rod and the epoxy that started at the loading point and propagated towards the support. Comparing the load range (kN) versus life curve for the beams with steel, strengthened with prestressed spirally wound and sand <b>coated</b> <b>rods</b> that failed in bond, shows that the beam strengthened with sand <b>coated</b> <b>rod</b> has longer fatigue lives than beam strengthened with spirally wound rod. A model was used to describe the progress of the debonding crack until excessive slipping occurred. The model predicted the number of cycles until excessive slipping between the CFRP rod and the epoxy occurred and the forces in the CFRP rod at all locations in the shear span at the onset of failure with reasonable accuracy...|$|R

The paper {{presents}} research made {{to achieve}} environmental powder precursors from a CuSnP alloy, {{used in the}} manufacturing process of brazing materials, such as <b>coated</b> <b>rods.</b> The innovation of the paper consists in the elemental participation of the components in the new alloys, procedure {{that takes place in}} the alloying process, throughcoat conditions of the addition materials and by simultaneous obtaining the new precursors that fulfill high friability and deoxidation conditions {{of the participants in the}} brazing process. Developing the copper alloy batches is conditioned by a good protection to oxidation and gas absorption from the melting oven atmosphere. In order to protect the melt from the above mentioned phenomena’s we developed a slagging flux, boron-cryolithe type, which has melting proprieties below those of the copper phosphorus alloy, approx. 700 °C. The load calculation was made based on the technical characteristics of the industrial base materials that were used, taking into account the loss coefficient of 5 %. The melting, casting and cooling of the samples, dimensioned so they will be friable, was accomplished through classic procedures. The grinding of the sample, including the moistening thermic treatments, was achieved by experimental research, followed by calculations, based on the criteria of maximum yield for grinding. Estimating the sample friability,in the preliminary phase of the experimental determinations, was needed in order to restrain the testing domain,through structural and hardness analyses.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{incidence of}} post-implant {{infection in the}} medical field has prompted further investigation into possible protective coatings to alleviate this problem. This study explores {{the use of a}} "scaffold" system to carry antimicrobial substances and prevent such infections. Hydroxyapatite (HAP), a calcium phosphate mineral phase, was used as a protective coating to bond with bone and act as a delivery system. Two polymers were also explored as delivery systems. PMMA (polymethyl-methacrylate) is a non-resorbable polymer, while PLGA (poly-lactide-glycolide) is resorbable and was expected to dissolve to release antimicrobials. The two antimicrobial agents were analyzed in the coatings were chlorhexidine and silver nitrate. Chlorhexidine has antimicrobial effects {{on a wide range of}} both gram-positive and gramnegative bacteria, and exhibits low resistance prevalence. Similarly, silver nitrate has been shown to inhibit growth of a wide range of microorganisms. The surfaces of the titanium alloy and stainless steel substrates were coated with combinations of HAP-based systems via the surface induced mineralization (SIM) method, and with the polymers through a dip-coating method. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to analyze the composition of the coatings and confirm their components. The efficacy of each type of coating in inhibiting microbial growth was tested in culture plates inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus, a common cause of the targeted infections. Metal <b>rods</b> <b>coated</b> with HAPlchlorhexidine and HAP/silver nitrate both showed inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus, whereas the uncoated <b>rods,</b> HAP-only <b>coated</b> <b>rods,</b> and all polymer <b>coated</b> <b>rods</b> exhibited no antimicrobial effects.

The given work {{considers}} {{the influence of}} the power supply type (diode rectifier DR- 306 and upon new generation inverter Nebula- 315) upon the chemical composition, microstructure, mechanical properties of the weld joints and health characteristics of the manual arc welding process. It has been found out that the power supply type has a significant influence upon the weld joints properties and health characteristics of the manual arc welding process. Using the inverter power supply type provides less heat input into a molten electrode metal drop which decreases silicium and manganese burning, improves impact resistance under low (negative) temperature and reduces the risk of workers respiratory diseases.

40|$|The thesis {{investigates the}} {{modification}} of paper into an ion- and electron-conductive material, {{and as a}} renewable material for electronic device. The study stretches from investigating {{the interaction between the}} cellulosic materials and the conducting polymer to demonstrating the performance of the conductive paper by printing the electronic structure {{on the surface of the}} conductive paper. Conducting materials such as conducting polymer, ionic liquids, and multi-wall carbon nanotubes were deposited into the fiber networks. In order to investigate the interaction between the conducting polymer and cellulosic material, the adsorption of the conducting polymer poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) : poly(4 -styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) onto microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) was performed. Electroconductive papers were produced via dip <b>coating</b> and <b>rod</b> <b>coating,</b> and characterized. The Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) / Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) images showed that the conducting polymer was deposited in the fiber and in fiber-fiber contact areas. The X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of dip-coated paper samples showed PEDOT enrichment on the surface. The effects of fiber beating and paper formation, addition of organic solvents and pigments (TiO 2, MWCNT), and calendering were investigated. Ionic paper was produced by depositing an ionic liquid into the commercial base paper. The dependence to temperature and relative humidity of the ionic conductivity was also investigated. In order to reduce the roughness and improve its printability, the ionic paper was surface-sized using different <b>coating</b> <b>rods.</b>  The bulk resistance increased with increasing surface sizing. The electrochemical performance of the ionic paper was confirmed by printing PEDOT:PSS on the surface. There was change in color of the polymer when a voltage was applied. It was demonstrated that the ionic paper is a good ionic conductor that can be used as component for a more compact electronic device construction. Conductive paper has a great potential to be a flexible substrate on which an electronic structure can be constructed. The conduction process in the modified paper is due to the density of charge carriers (ions and electrons), and their short range mobility in the material. The charge carrying is believed to be heterogeneous, involving many charged species as the paper material is chemically heterogeneous.

Size, shape and surface functionalization including opsonization of gold particles ranging from a few nanometers to hundreds of nanometers {{are among the most}} crucial parameters that have been focussed on. Cytoxicity of nanomaterial has been assessed by common cytotoxicity assays targeting enzymatic activity such as LDH, MTT and ECIS. So far, however, less {{attention has been paid to}} the mechanical parameters of cells exposed to gold particles, which is an important reporter on the cellular response to external stimuli. Results: Mechanical properties of confluent MDCK II cells exposed to gold nanorods as a function of surface functionalization and concentration have been explored by atomic force microscopy and quartz crystal microbalance measurements in combination with fluorescence and dark-field microscopy. Conclusion: We found that cells exposed to CTAB coated gold nanorods display a concentration-dependent stiffening that cannot be explained by the presence of CTAB alone. The stiffening results presumably from endocytosis of particles removing excess membrane area from the cell’s surface. Another aspect could be the collapse of the plasma membrane on the actin cortex.

In this study, two base papers from Mazandaran Wood and Paper Industries (APC and NS), and two coating compositions with the solid content of 25 % containing PCC filler (100 parts), PVA binder (14 parts) and dispersant (1 part) were used. The first composition included PCC B 102 for opacity increment, and the second one PCC 9020 for the improvement of brightness. Two rod RDS 14 and RDS 30 were used for different coating weights. After coating, the treated samples were dried in room conditions at air temperature of 25 ◦C and relative humidity of 54 %. Physical and optical properties of control and treated samples such as air resistance, thickness, Cobb 60, brightness, yellowness, opacity and roughness were determined. In comparison to the control group, all the treated samples showed improvement in brightness, opacity, yellowness and air resistance. By the two different formulations and two rods, paper roughness was increased, and the increment of water absorption was due to capillary development in coating texture.

Two different coating techniques were used: <b>rod</b> <b>coating</b> and size press. The MFC suspension used has a high water content and water is known to deteriorate {{the properties of the}} paper, so water treated paper substrates were prepared as references to give an indication of the effects that the processing has on the final properties of the coated papers. The structure of the MFC coating and associated surface properties were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and by measuring the thickness and the roughness of the coated substrates. A tool to visualise the distribution of the MFC was developed and the tensile properties ofthe MFC coated substrates were characterised. Resistance to air, oxygen and water vapour permeationas well as water and grease absorption were used to describe the barrier properties of the coated papers. The MFC coated paper substrates exhibited a higher roughness than the reference paper substrate. This was due to the sensitivity of the substrate to water and not from the coating material it self since the water treated paper substrates showed an even higher roughness than the MFC coated substrates. The latter showed slightly increased tensile properties compared to the reference paper substrates, and most importantly, reduced air permeance and grease absorption (- 100 % and - 84 % respectively); for the <b>rod</b> <b>coated</b> paper substrate with 3 g⁄m 2 coat weight.

The <b>rod</b> <b>coating</b> allowed a good control of the coat weight in a range of 1 to 3 g⁄m 2. However, the Mayer rod and the high viscosity of the MFC suspension caused poor MFC distribution and a coating which reproduced the rod pattern. With the size press, coat weights around 1 g⁄m 2 were reached. The MFC did not build a coating layer on the paper substrate surface but was impregnated into the paper substrate by the rollers...|$|R
50|$|Braze welding {{is the use}} of {{a bronze}} or brass filler <b>rod</b> <b>coated</b> with flux to join steel workpieces. The {{equipment}} needed for braze welding is basically identical to the equipment used in brazing. Since braze welding usually requires more heat than brazing, acetylene or methylacetylene-propadiene (MAP) gas fuel is commonly used. The name {{comes from the fact that}} no capillary action is used.|$|R
40|$|Soft robotic systems rely on highly {{deformable}} {{materials to}} achieve functionality. While this deformability enables unique capabilities, it also presents new challenges {{not found in}} traditional robotic systems. In a traditional robot, motion is concentrated at discrete joints; in a soft robot, deformations are distributed throughout the body. In order to control these deformations, they must be observed. Making these observations requires the development and integration of sensors which are mechanically and materially compatible with the body they are sensing. The coupling of deformation degrees of freedom within a soft body results in complex motions which are best described and controlled with parallel kinematics formulations, which in turn drives the design of sensors and actuators. ^ The work presented in this thesis is comprised of three related research areas. First, I investigated the process of fabricating thick elastomer films using multi-layer spin <b>coating</b> and <b>rod</b> <b>coating.</b> Second, I demonstrated the use of conductive elastomer composites to create capacitive strain sensors for highly deformable systems. Finally, I integrated soft sensors with soft actuators to control the deformation of an elastomer body. In this {{last part of the}} work, I used six sensor and actuator pairs to achieve full motion control of a deformable body using a parallel kinematics configuration. Together, these advances provide tools which can be used to develop more advanced soft robotic systems with closed-loop deformation control. ...|$|R

Especially, the dip-coating process is suitable to prepare double-sided coatings at the same time.|$|R
