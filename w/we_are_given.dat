25|$|Suppose <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>given</b> a {{monotonic}} path, {{which may}} happen {{to cross the}} diagonal. The exceedance of the path is defined to be the number of vertical edges which lie above the diagonal.

25|$|The halting {{problem is}} an {{analogous}} example {{from the field}} of centralised computation: <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>given</b> a computer program and the task is to decide whether it halts or runs forever. The halting problem is undecidable in the general case, and naturally understanding the behaviour of a computer network is at least as hard as understanding the behaviour of one computer.|$|E

25|$|Note that a maximal {{matching}} with k edges is an edge dominating {{set with}} k edges. Conversely, if <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>given</b> a minimum edge dominating set with k edges, we can construct a maximal matching with k edges in polynomial time. Therefore, {{the problem of}} finding a minimum maximal matching is essentially equal {{to the problem of}} finding a minimum edge dominating set. Both of these two optimization problems are known to be NP-hard; the decision versions of these problems are classical examples of NP-complete problems. Both problems can be approximated within factor 2 in polynomial time: simply find an arbitrary maximal matching M.|$|E
25|$|A presheaf F on a {{topological space}} {{is called a}} sheaf if it {{satisfies}} the sheaf condition: whenever an open subset is covered by open subsets Ui, and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>given</b> elements of F(Ui) for all i whose restrictions to Ui ∩ Uj agree for all i, j, then they are images of a unique element of F(U). By analogy, an étale presheaf is called a sheaf if it satisfies the same condition (with intersections of open sets replaced by pullbacks of étale morphisms, and where a set of étale maps to U is said to cover U if the topological space underlying U is the union of their images). More generally, one can define a sheaf for any Grothendieck topology on a category in a similar way.|$|E
25|$|Suppose, to the contrary, {{that there}} is a function, f, on the natural numbers with f(n+1) an element of f(n) for each n. Define S = {f(n): n a natural number}, the range of f, which can be seen to be a set from the axiom schema of replacement. Applying the axiom of {{regularity}} to S, let B be an element of S which is disjoint from S. By the definition of S, B must be f(k) for some natural number k. However, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>given</b> that f(k) contains f(k+1) which is also an element of S. So f(k+1) is in the intersection of f(k) and S. This contradicts {{the fact that they are}} disjoint sets. Since our supposition led to a contradiction, there must not be any such function, f.|$|E

25|$|With his contemporaries, Willaert {{developed}} the canzone (a form of polyphonic secular song) and ricercare, which were forerunners of modern instrumental forms. Willaert also arranged 22 four-part madrigals for voice and lute written by Verdelot. In an early 4-part vocal work, Quid non ebrietas? (In some sources called the Chromatic Duo) Willaert uses musica ficta {{around the circle}} of 5ths {{in one of the}} voices resulting in an augmented 7th in unison with the ending octave, an outstanding experiment with chromatic enharmonicism. Willaert {{was among the first to}} extensively use chromaticism in the madrigal. Looking forward, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>given</b> an image of early word painting in his madrigal Mentre che'l cor. Willaert, who was fond of the older compositional techniques such as the canon, often placed the melody in the tenor of his compositions, treating it as a cantus firmus. Willaert, with the help of De Rore, standardized a five-voice setting in madrigal composition. Willaert also pioneered a style that continued until the end of the madrigal period of reflecting the emotional qualities of the text and the meanings of important words as sharply and clearly as possible.|$|E
