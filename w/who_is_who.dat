5|$|According to Savenko, the Serbsky Center {{has long}} labored to legalize its monopolistic {{position}} of the Main expert institution of the country. The ambition and permissiveness—which, due to proximity to power, allow the Serbsky Center {{to get in touch}} over the telephone with the judges and explain to them <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>who</b> and what is the guideline, although the judges themselves have already learned it—have {{turned out to be a}} considerable drop in the level of the expert reports on many positions. Such a drop was inevitable and foreseeable in the context of the Serbsky Center efforts to eliminate adversary character of the expert reports of the parties, then to maximally degrade the role of the specialist as a reviewer and critic of the presented expert report, and to legalize the state of affairs. Lyubov Vinogradova believes there has been a continuous diminution in patients' rights as independent experts are now excluded from processes, cannot speak in court and can do nothing against the State experts.|$|E
25|$|The {{paintings}} in the exhibition were loaned by virtually <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>who</b> of the Pakistani elite. In his lifetime Sadequain hardly ever sold his paintings to individuals. As an ironic twist of circumstances he is perhaps the only artist with the distinction that his work is openly copied and sold for handsome profits by his imitators. Recently two news stories were printed in local papers, which testify, in the most unconventional manner, to the great stature of Sadequain. Both news stories were related to burglars, one in which a house belonging {{to one of the}} prominent artists in Karachi was broken in and the thieves got away with jewellery and other petty items, and the other incident involved the house of a well to do citizen where the stolen items included only the paintings by Sadequain.|$|E
25|$|Posing as {{an elderly}} woman named Betsy, Sheila takes Phyllis, Summer, and Fen to a nearby {{retirement}} home to hide out. After learning of their location, Lauren goes to that home carrying a gun in her purse. Following a tip from a neighbor, Lauren finds Sheila's apartment and forces her way inside. Sheila and Phyllis then argue over <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>who,</b> and Lauren screams at them to stop. Sheila then runs to grab baby Summer {{in order to use}} her as a shield against Lauren; Phyllis tells Lauren to point the gun at her to protect her daughter, and a frightened Lauren, realizing the real Phyllis would never put her daughter in the line of fire, turns to Sheila and shoots her. Sheila is then declared dead at the scene.|$|E

A Serbian pilot, Vlatko Vodopivec, criticised the lack of security around the aircraft at the airport, describing the facility as [...] "chaotic".

2500|$|Still {{remembered in}} Poland as the renowned punk rocker Walek Dzedzej, Cyril Danicki {{traveled}} to the country of his birth for one final visit. In summer 1997 he appeared on the Warsaw-based Polsat TV rock nostalgia program <b>Who</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Who,</b> performing his near-iconic rebel anthem [...] "Nie jestem tym czym ty" [...] ("I Am Not What You Are"), directing the lyrics at those clinging to conventionality and outdated values. The lyrics have a timeless appeal and apply equally to the recently departed Communist system and its collaborators and adherents, {{as well as to}} the general numbing mindset of present-day conformity and lack of originality. Shortly after this appearance, Cyril Danicki returned to New York.|$|E
2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{his term}} as mayor, Henry Sawtell fell ill and could not fulfil his functions. [...] Councillor Bishop filled his place during that time. The {{election}} of the next mayor was held on 18 December 1872, but The Press, the local Christchurch newspaper, already reported on 14 December of Councillor Bishop as mayor-elect. The election took place on the agreed date, and Bishop was elected unanimously. In those days, the councillors elected one of their group as mayor, i.e. the position was not elected at large (by the voting public) as is the case today. On the evening of his election, Bishop gave a banquet for 50 people at the Clarendon Hotel, with those present representing the <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>who</b> of colonial Christchurch.|$|E

Enghien is pretty sure to have sent a list {{containing}} the names of any court gallants that have fallen, and their relatives will at once have been notified of it, {{and will not be}} present at the court. As to the others, who have merely lost lovers, they will not break their hearts over it. It is the fashion to change them so rapidly that probably not a few of the ladies will have consoled themselves for their absence already. However, to begin with, I daresay I shall be able to act as your mentor and guide, and point out to you <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>who,</b> so that you can avoid falling into serious errors. You see, there are half a dozen parties at court already. There are Mazarin's friends, who, by the way, are not numerous; there are the Duke of Beaufort's clique; there is Conde's party.|$|E

6000|$|Consider what {{it would}} mean to be under a socialist state. Here for example is a worker <b>who</b> <b>is,</b> <b>who</b> says he is, too ill to work. He begs that he may be set free. The grave official, as Mr. Bellamy sees him, looks at the worker's tongue. [...] "My poor fellow," [...] says he, [...] "you are indeed ill. Go and rest {{yourself}} under a shady tree while the others are busy with the harvest." [...] So speaks the ideal official dealing with the ideal citizen in the dream life among the angels. But suppose that the worker, being not an angel but a human being, is but a mere hulking, lazy brute who prefers to sham sick rather than endure the tedium of toil. Or suppose that the grave official is not an angel, but a man of hateful heart or one with a personal spite to vent upon his victim. What then? How could one face a régime in which the everlasting taskmaster held control? There is nothing like it among us at the present day except within the melancholy precincts of the penitentiary. There and there only, the socialist system is in operation.|$|E
6000|$|... 20. I {{have been}} so teased with Whiggish {{discourse}} by Mrs. Barton and Lady Betty Germaine, never saw the like. They turn all this affair of the Pope-burning into ridicule; and, indeed, they have made too great a clutter about it, if they had no real reason to apprehend some tumults. I dined with Lady Betty. I hear Prior's commission is passed to be Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary for the peace; my Lord Privy Seal, who you know is Bishop of Bristol, is the other; and Lord Strafford, already Ambassador at The Hague, the third: I am forced to tell you, ignorant sluts, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>who.</b> I was punning scurvily with Sir Andrew Fountaine and Lord Pembroke this evening: do you ever pun now? Sometimes with the Dean, or Tom Leigh.(4) Prior puns very well. Odso, I must go see His Excellency, 'tis a noble advancement: but they could do no less, after sending him to France. Lord Strafford is as proud as Hell, and how he will bear one of Prior's mean birth on an equal character with him, I know not. And so I go to my business, and bid you good-night.|$|E

I give it to you, Miss Ashleigh, as much as I do to Ada, for as you come out under my charge, I consider myself as responsible for you equally. To you, Ada, I say be very careful you do not let your high spirits run away with you; above all, do not become noisy: I know well what your tendency is. This does not apply to you, Miss Ashleigh, for although you have good spirits, I know you are not likely to let them run away with you as Ada is. Do not either of you, I beg, dance more than once, or at most twice with any gentleman. This applies equally to you, Miss Ashleigh, as the heiress to a considerable fortune. It is incumbent on you both to be very careful with whom you dance,--I mean, dance frequently: there is nothing more damaging to a girl than that her name should be mentioned as seen flirting with any but a most eligible party; and as at present you do not know <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>who,</b> you cannot be too careful." ...|$|E

6000|$|Before his marriage, John {{had always}} {{had the idea that}} pretty, affectionate little women were {{religious}} and self-denying at heart, as matters of course. No matter through what labyrinths of fashionable follies and dissipation they had been wandering, still a talent for saintship was lying dormant in their natures, which it needed only the touch of love to develop. The wings of the angel were always concealed under the fashionable attire of the belle, and would unfold themselves when the hour came. A nearer acquaintance with Lillie, he was forced to confess, had not, so far, confirmed this idea. Though hers was a face so fair and pure that, when he first knew her, it suggested ideas of prayer, and communion with angels, yet he could not disguise from himself that, in all near acquaintance with her, she had proved to be most remarkably [...] "of the earth, earthy." [...] She was alive and fervent about fashionable gossip,--of <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>who,</b> and what does what; she was alive to equipages, to dress, to sightseeing, to dancing, to any thing of which the whole stimulus and excitement was earthly and physical. At times, too, he remembered that she had talked a sort of pensive sentimentalism, of a slightly religious nature; but the least idea of a moral purpose in life--of self-denial, and devotion to something higher than immediate self-gratification--seemed never to have entered her head. What is more, John had found his attempts to introduce such topics with her always unsuccessful. Lillie either gaped in his face, and asked him what time it was; or playfully pulled his whiskers, and asked him why he didn't take to the ministry; or adroitly turned the conversation with kissing and compliments.|$|E

'DEAREST MOTHER---Here are my Christmas {{wishes that}} we may all be right again at home this year, and that {{you could see the}} brace of {{pheasants}} I killed. However, Gill and I are in uncommonly nice quarters. I shall let her tell the long story about <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>who,</b> for there is such a swarm of cousins, and uncles, and aunts, and when you think you have hold of the right one, {{it turns out to be}} the other lot. There are three houses choke full of them, and more floating about, and all running in and out, till it gets like the little pig that could not be counted, it ran about so fast. They are all Underwood or Harewood, more or less, except the Vanderkists, who are all girls except a little fellow in knickerbockers. Poor little chap, his father was a great man on the turf, and ruined him horse and foot before he was born, and then died of D. T., and his mother is a great invalid, and very badly off, with no end of daughters---the most stunning girls you ever saw---real beauties, and no mistake, especially Emily, who is great fun besides. She is to be Helena when we act Midsummer Night's Dream on Twelfth Night for all the natives, and I am Demetrius, dirty cad that he is! She lives with the Grinsteads, and Anna with the Travis Underwoods, Phyllis's young man's bosses. If he makes as good a thing of it as they have done, she will be no end of a swell. Mr. Travis Underwood has brought down his hunters and gives me a mount. Claude would go stark staring mad to see his Campeador.|$|E
