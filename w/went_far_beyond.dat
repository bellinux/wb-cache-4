5|$|Kagan {{believes}} that while Alcibiades was a commander of considerable ability, {{he was no}} military genius, and his confidence and ambitions <b>went</b> <b>far</b> <b>beyond</b> his skills. He thus was capable of important errors and serious miscalculations. Kagan argues that at Notium, Alcibiades committed a serious error in leaving the fleet {{in the hands of}} an inexperienced officer, and that most of the credit for the brilliant victory at Cyzicus must be assigned to Thrasybulus. In this judgement, Kagan agrees with Cornelius Nepos, who said that the Athenians' extravagant opinion of Alcibiades's abilities and valor was his chief misfortune.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the impact}} was {{far greater than}} anyone on the Allied side realised, and the ramifications <b>went</b> <b>far</b> <b>beyond</b> New Guinea. Imperial General Headquarters had {{regarded}} the defeats in the Guadalcanal Campaign and Battle of Buna–Gona as setbacks only, and had continued to plan offensives in the South West Pacific. Now it concluded that the Japanese position was over-extended. A new defensive line was drawn running through Western New Guinea, the Caroline Islands and the Mariana Islands. Henceforth, positions beyond that line would be held as an outpost line. General Imamura was now charged not with winning a decisive victory, but only with holding on {{as long as possible}} so as to delay the Allied advance.|$|E

5|$|The {{injustice}} {{which has}} been done to our author's works, in estimating their poetical merit, rendered us doubly anxious, on opening his last volume, to find it likely to seize fast hold of general sympathy, and thus turn an overwhelming power against the paltry traducers of talent, more eminently promising in many respects, than any the present age has been called upon to encourage. We have not found it to be quite all that we wished in this respect--and {{it would have been very}} extraordinary if we had, for our wishes <b>went</b> <b>far</b> <b>beyond</b> reasonable expectations. But we have found it of a nature to present to common understandings the poetical power with which the author's mind is gifted, in a more tangible and intelligible shape than that in which it has appeared in any of his former compositions. It is, therefore, calculated to throw shame on the lying, vulgar spirit, in which this young worshipper in the temple of the Muses has been cried-down; whatever questions may still leave to be settled as to the kind and degree of his poetical merits. Take for instance, as proof of the justice of our praise, the following passage from an Ode to the Nightingale:--it is distinct, noble, pathetic, and true: the thoughts have all chords of direct communication with naturally-constituted hearts: the echoes of the strain linger bout the depths of human bosoms.|$|E

Briggs's four types were later identified as corresponding to the IXXXs, EXXPs, EXTJs and EXFJs. Her first publications were two articles describing Jung's theory, in the journal New Republic in 1926 ("Meet Yourself Using the Personality Paint Box") and 1928 ("Up From Barbarism"). After extensively studying the work of Jung, they turned their interest in human behavior into efforts to turn the theory of psychological types to practical use.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of the non-Euclidean geometries had a ripple effect which <b>went</b> <b>far</b> <b>beyond</b> the boundaries of mathematics and science. The philosopher Immanuel Kant's treatment of human knowledge had a special role for geometry. It was his prime example of synthetic a priori knowledge; not derived from the senses nor deduced through logic— our knowledge of space was a truth that we were born with. Unfortunately for Kant, his concept of this unalterably true geometry was Euclidean. Theology was also affected by the change from absolute truth to relative truth {{in the way that}} mathematics is related to the world around it, that was a result of this paradigm shift.|$|E
25|$|By {{the year}} 1991, {{most of the}} {{classical}} problems of enumerative geometry had been solved and interest in enumerative geometry had begun to diminish. The field was reinvigorated in May 1991 when physicists Philip Candelas, Xenia de la Ossa, Paul Green, and Linda Parks showed that mirror symmetry {{could be used to}} translate difficult mathematical questions about one Calabi–Yau manifold into easier questions about its mirror. In particular, they used mirror symmetry to show that a six-dimensional Calabi–Yau manifold can contain exactly 317,206,375 curves of degree three. In addition to counting degree-three curves, Candelas and his collaborators obtained a number of more general results for counting rational curves which <b>went</b> <b>far</b> <b>beyond</b> the results obtained by mathematicians.|$|E

25|$|Since early youth Baleztena {{demonstrated}} {{particular interest}} in everything related to Giants and Bigheads; he was engaged in design, construction and carrying the figures. He later became an expert on gigantes, investigating their history and related rituals down to minuscule details. His interests gradually broadened to all Pamplonese feasts; in the 1920s he emerged as their key organizer and expert, publishing a number of related works and incalculable newspaper pieces. His contribution soon <b>went</b> <b>far</b> <b>beyond</b> cultivating local customs, as Baleztena was also reconstructing old-forgotten rituals and inventing new ones, incorporating them into celebrations of Epiphany, Holy Week or Corpus Christi; he launched also stand-alone customs like Procesión de San Saturnino. His activities went beyond Pamplona, as he revitalised local romerias, like the one to Ujué. All feasts contained a strong if not vital religious component, like the massive 1922 celebrations commemorating San Francisco Javier, styled as “arquetipo navarro. Some were strongly flavoured by Carlism, like the annual pilgrimage to Javier, launched in 1939.|$|E
25|$|Ambassadors and envoys from Russia to Poland–Lithuania in {{the years}} 1763–1794 {{were among the most}} {{important}} characters in the politics of Poland. Their powers <b>went</b> <b>far</b> <b>beyond</b> those of most diplomats and can be compared to those of viceroys in the colonies of Spanish Empire, or Roman Republic's proconsuls in Roman provinces. During most of that period ambassadors and envoys from the Russian Empire, acting on the instructions from Saint Petersburg, held a de facto position superior to that of the Polish king, Stanisław August Poniatowski. Backed by the presence of the Russian army within the borders of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and leveraging the immense wealth of the Russian Empire, they were able to influence both the king and the Polish parliament, the Sejm. According to their demands, the king dispensed the Commonwealth offices among the Russian supporters, and the Sejm, bribed or threatened, voted as the Russians dictated. The agenda of the Permanent Council (Polish government) was edited and approved by the Russian ambassador, {{and the members of the}} Council were approved by him.|$|E
25|$|Taking into {{consideration}} the presence of folk music, the aspirations of the Illyrians <b>went</b> <b>far</b> <b>beyond</b> the results achieved, something that is also continued {{in the work of}} Ivan Zajc (1832–1914) {{in the second half of}} the century. His masterpiece, the opera Nikola Šubić Zrinjski, ever since its opening night in Zagreb in 1876, had not lost in popularity, partly because its heroic patriotism functions as a symbol of Croatia's victory. Finally, owing to the founder of Croatian ethno-musicology and musical historiography, Franjo Kuhač (1834–1911), the systematic research of folklore evolved simultaneously with Zajc's endeavours. Finally it should be added that in Zajc's and Kuhač's era, major halls for musical performances and concerts were built: in Zagreb the building of the Croatian Music Institute (1876, 1895) with a concert hall, and the building of the Croatian National Theatre (1895), including the theatre buildings in Rijeka (1885), Split (1893) and Osijek (1907) where, along with the Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb, drama, opera and ballet performances are still played today.|$|E
