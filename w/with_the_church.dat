5|$|A royal {{charter of}} 1215 gave Wellington {{its status as}} a town, and during the medieval period it grew as a centre for trade on the road from Bristol to Exeter, being laid out, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> at the east end of town, in a similar manner to other towns of this era. In 1548, the manor was sold to Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, but reverted to the control of the bishops after his execution.

The church was of relatively simple construction, but of unusual size, and A.

This made the Western Isles the Scottish council area with the smallest percentage of atheists in the population. There are also small Episcopalian congregations in Lewis and Harris and the Outer Hebrides are part of the Diocese of Argyll and The Isles in both the Episcopalian and Catholic traditions.|$|E
5|$|By {{contrast}} with the tensions in England, in Normandy Henry had occasional disagreements <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> but generally enjoyed very {{good relations with the}} Norman bishops. In Brittany, Henry had the support of the local church hierarchy and rarely intervened in clerical matters, except occasionally in order to cause difficulties for his rival Louis of France. Further south, however, the power of the dukes of Aquitaine over the local church was much less than in the north, and Henry's efforts to extend his influence over local appointments created tensions. During the disputed papal election of 1159, Henry, like Louis, supported Alexander III over his rival Victor IV.|$|E

The east window was erected in memory of Sir Frank Stapleton, rector of Mereworth 1832–74. Other similar glass dates from the 17th and 18th centuries. Another, depicting the Raising of Lazarus, was designed by Frederic Shields for the Heaton, Butler and Bayne firm in 1889.|$|E
5|$|Government {{publications}} on {{the dangers}} of sects increased between 1996 and 1998, and a significant number of them dealt <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> of Scientology. The German courts had approved such publications in 1989, seeing them as part of the government's responsibility to keep the public informed, and finding that they did not interfere with religious freedom. In 1996, the German parliament launched an Enquete (Enquiry) Commission to investigate sects and similar groups, {{in large part because of}} public concerns about Scientology. Its final report, published in June 1998, concluded that Scientology, alone among new religious movements, required monitoring by Germany's domestic intelligence services.|$|E
5|$|Henry's {{ability to}} govern was intimately bound up <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church,</b> which formed {{the key to}} the {{administration}} of both England and Normandy, and this relationship changed considerably {{over the course of his}} reign. William the Conqueror had reformed the English Church with the support of his Archbishop of Canterbury, Lanfranc, who became a close colleague and advisor to the King. Under William Rufus this arrangement had collapsed, the King and Archbishop Anselm had become estranged and Anselm had gone into exile. Henry also believed in Church reform, but on taking power in England he became embroiled in the investiture controversy.|$|E

5|$|Henry's {{relationship}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> varied considerably {{across his}} lands and over time: {{as with other}} aspects of his rule, there was no attempt to form a common ecclesiastical policy. Insofar as Henry had a policy it was to generally push back on papal influence, increasing his own local authority. The 12th century saw a reforming movement within the Church, however, advocating greater autonomy from royal authority for the clergy and more influence for the papacy. This trend had already caused tensions in England, for example when King Stephen forced Theobald of Bec, the Archbishop of Canterbury, into exile in 1152. There were also long-running concerns over the legal treatment {{of members of the}} clergy.|$|E
5|$|Hensley was short, {{normally}} soft-spoken, {{and friendly}} with churchgoers. Most attendees at his services were miners or farmers from the Appalachian Mountains; congregants typically arrived at services on horseback or in a Ford Model A.

Hensley's sister Bertha, who lived in Ohio, was also a licensed minister <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> of God. In 1922, he conducted services with her in Ohio.
