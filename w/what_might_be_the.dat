[...] Evan Sawdey of PopMatters remarked that the song is [...] "stunning, jaw-dropping highlight". He added that [...] "Martin pounds away at a bouncy toy-piano melody... leading into a chorus where guitarist Jonny Buckland gets to unleash <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> catchiest guitar riff he's written...

500|$|In {{his review}} of Moonraker in 1979, the Chicago Sun-Times film critic Roger Ebert, while clearly expressing his {{approval}} of the advanced special effects and Ken Adam's extravagant production sets, criticised the pace in which {{the locations of the}} film evolved, remarking that, [...] "it's so jammed with faraway places and science fiction special effects that Bond has to move at a trot just to make it into all the scenes". Christopher Null of Filmcritic.com said of the film: [...] "Most rational observers agree that Moonraker is without a doubt the most absurd James Bond movie, definitely of the Roger Moore era and possibly of all time". However, while he criticised the extravagance of the plot and action sequences, he believed that this added to the enjoyment of the film, and particularly approved of the remark [...] "I think he's attempting re-entry!"

500|$|German {{reports on}} 17 August stated {{that all the}} tankers in the recent Mediterranean convoy had been sunk {{and none of the}} {{transports}} had reached their destination (assumed to be Egypt). The Allies had lost thirteen vessels, including nine merchantmen, one aircraft carrier (Eagle), two cruisers (Manchester and Cairo) and a destroyer (Foresight) but the Royal Navy and the Merchant Navy had saved Malta. The arrival of about [...] of general cargo, together with petrol, oil fuel, kerosene and diesel fuel, was enough to give the island about ten more weeks supply beyond the few weeks that the existing stocks would last. Axis propaganda broadcasts made extravagant claims but a Kriegsmarine report noted the incomplete and contradictory evidence, allowing only a provisional conclusion. The arrival of four merchant ships and a tanker was unsatisfactory, because the revival of Malta as an offensive base would affect Axis supply routes in <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> [...] "decisive phase of the struggle for North Africa". Supermarina reached the same conclusion and Generale Giuseppe Santoro, deputy {{chief of staff of the}} Regia Aeronautica, wrote that the British had achieved a strategic success by bringing Malta back into action [...] "in the final phase of the struggle in Egypt".|$|E

2500|$|With {{regard to}} the VOC's {{importance}} in global corporate history, Australian journalist Hugh Edwards (1970) writes, [...] "The Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie was the most powerful single commercial concern {{the world has ever}} known.

[...] In his book Amsterdam: A History of the World's Most Liberal City (2013), Russell Shorto summarizes the VOC's greatness: [...] "Like the oceans it mastered, the VOC had a scope that is hard to fathom. One could craft a defensible argument that no company in history has had such an impact on the world. Its surviving archivesâ€”in Cape Town, Colombo, Chennai, Jakarta, and The Hagueâ€”have been measured (by a consortium applying for a UNESCO grant to preserve them) in kilometers. In innumerable ways the VOC both expanded the world and brought its far-flung regions together. It introduced Europe to Asia and Africa, and vice versa (while its sister multinational, the West India Company, set New York City in motion and colonized Brazil and the Caribbean Islands). It pioneered globalization and invented <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> first modern bureaucracy. It advanced cartography and shipbuilding. It fostered disease, slavery, and exploitation on a scale never before imaged." ...|$|E
2500|$|To {{get over}} {{news of the}} death of his ex-girlfriend, Buffy, Angel spends three months in a [...] monastery, where he {{encounters}} some demon monks and goes home frustrated in season three. [...] He returns to Los Angeles, as does Darla â€” now bearing his child. [...] Daniel Holtz, an old enemy of both Angel and Darla, is resurrected by a demon to take revenge on the vampires that killed his family. [...] The group is puzzled over <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> first vampire birth. Darla sacrifices her life {{to save the life of}} her child, Connor. [...] The gang is eager to care for the infant, but Wesley soon learns of a (false) frightening prophecy that suggests that Angel will murder his son. [...] Feeling disconnected from the group, Wesley does not share this information, and quietly kidnaps Connor. [...] This backfires as he is attacked and the child is seized by Holtz and his protÃ©gÃ©e Justine. Wanting Angel to suffer the loss of a child as he did, Holtz escapes through a rip in the fabric of space to the dimension of Quor'Toth, and raises the boy as his own. [...] Angel feels that his son is lost forever, and tries to murder Wesley. [...] Though he survives, Wesley is banished from the group. [...] Weeks later, Connor returns, but because time moves faster in Quor'Toth, he is now a teenage boy, having been raised by Holtz. [...] Tricking Angel into believing he needs to be the one to take Connor in, Holtz gives Angel a letter letting Connor know that he will be leaving and to trust Angel. [...] Holtz gets Justine to kill him, but ends up making it look like a vampire attack so Connor will assume the worst. [...] Connor imprisons his birth father, Angel, in a casket and drops it to the bottom of the ocean. Cordelia's visions have been progressively getting worse, and she becomes part demon to make them easier on herself. Her old lover, the Groosalugg, comes back from Pylea to be with her, but leaves her when he discovers that she instead loves Angel.|$|E
