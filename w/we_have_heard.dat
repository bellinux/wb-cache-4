5|$|These three works {{which we}} have {{composed}} we desire should be put in their hands in royal cities {{as well as in}} the most fair city of Berytus, which may well be styled the nursing mother of law, as indeed previous Emperors have commanded, but in no other places which did not enjoy the same privilege in old times, as <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> that even in the brilliant city of Alexandria, and in Caesarea and others, there have been ignorant men who, instead of doing their duty, conveyed spurious lessons to their pupils, and such as these we desire to make desist from that attempt by laying down the above limits, so that, if they should hereafter be guilty of such conduct and carry on their duties outside the royal cities and the metropolis Berytus, they may be punished by a fine of ten pounds of gold and be expelled from the city in which instead of teaching the law they transgress the law.|$|E
5|$|November 27, 1888: Petition {{from the}} King of Rurutu and the Queen of Rimatara and their nobles to Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, {{and to the}} Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. May you have good health. We, Teuruarii, King of Rurutu and Te Maere, Queen of Rimatara and our nobles, ask for the Prime Minister to place our islands and our ships under the {{protection}} of the British flag. These are the islands, namely, Rurutu, Rimatara, and Marià, and there are the names of the ships: Faaito and Ronui, and the masters of the same are natives. This is our word to you: Do not forsake us; we are your children; you taught us the word of God, and that has led us in the path of civilisation; therefore we know that you are a good parent to us. The thoughts of the children cling fondly to their good parent; they do not wish to be separated from their good parent. If the parent forsake the children, the children will seek the parent; so do we; we are like those children, and we ask that you will give us your flag to protect us. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> that you have taken Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands under your protection, but we remain without anyone to protect us. When we received the news that Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands were placed under your protection, we wept aloud because we were forsaken by you; we were afraid lest we should be adopted by another parent. The strange parent we mean is the French. They did not feed us with the milk of the gospel, but you did. O Great Britain; you fed us with that milk which has given life to us. This is our last word to you; we do not wish for French annexation or protection, not at all, but we wish you to be our parent, O Great Britain. We pray you now to accede to this our request. This letter was written in the house of Queen Pa. -TEURUARII, TE MAERE ARII.|$|E
25|$|Nahum Tate's {{well-known}} carol While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks (1700) {{is entirely}} devoted to describing the Annunciation to the shepherds, and the episode is also significant in The First Nowell, Angels from the Realms of Glory, the originally French carol Angels <b>We</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Heard</b> on High, and several others.|$|E

25|$|Even {{what we hear}} must be {{attached}} to a visual image. To help recall something <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> rather than seen, we should attach to their words the appearance, facial expression, and gestures of the person speaking {{as well as the}} appearance of the room. The speaker should therefore create strong visual images, through expression and gesture, which will fix the impression of his words. All the rhetorical textbooks contain detailed advice on declamatory gesture and expression; this underscores the insistence of Aristotle, Avicenna, and other philosophers, on the primacy and security for memory of the visual over all other sensory modes, auditory, tactile, and the rest.|$|E
25|$|Evolution, like prohibition, {{is a broad}} term. In recent bickering, however, {{evolution}} has been understood to mean the theory which holds that man has developed from some pre-existing lower type. This is the popular significance of evolution, just as the popular significance of prohibition is prohibition of the traffic in intoxicating liquors. It was in that sense that evolution {{was used in this}} act. It is in this sense that the word will be used in this opinion, unless the context otherwise indicates. It is only to the theory of the evolution of man from a lower type that the act before us was intended to apply, and much of the discussion <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> is beside this case.|$|E

In November, 1583, from his castle Arensberg in Westphalia, he wrote to Francis Walsingham, adviser and spymaster to Queen Elizabeth: [...] "Our needs are pressing, and you [...] and the Queen's other virtuous counsellors we believe can aid us; moreover, since God has called us to a knowledge of Himself, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> from our counsellors that you love and further the service of God." ...|$|E

Brian Mansfield of USA Today gave the album two-and-a-half out of four stars, opining that it [...] "has the feel of a blockbuster rock album" [...] but suggesting that the Christian songwriting on the record would limit its success.|$|E
500|$|My Kind of Christmas is {{the third}} studio album and first Christmas album by American singer Christina Aguilera. It was {{released}} on October 24, 2000, by RCA Records. The album was recorded from late-1999 to late-2000, while Aguilera was touring to promote her first two studio albums: Christina Aguilera (1999) and Mi Reflejo (2000). My Kind of Christmas contains cover versions of Christmas standards, such as [...] "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" [...] and [...] "Angels <b>We</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Heard</b> on High", {{as well as several}} original recordings, which incorporate dance-pop elements. The album was produced by Ron Fair, The Matrix, Robbie Buchanan, Barry Harris and Chris Cox.|$|E

500|$|The Christmas Sessions {{has been}} {{described}} as a rock and pop rock album; influences from country and jazz were also noted. [...] "It Came Upon a Midnight Clear" [...] {{has been described}} as being a stadium rock song incorporating musical elements similar to rock bands U2 and Coldplay; [...] "I Heard the Bells On Christmas Day", a power ballad, was also described as being similar to U2 in sound. [...] "Gloria" [...] is a reinterpretation of [...] "Angels <b>We</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Heard</b> on High", modifying the melody of the song's chorus. [...] "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen" [...] utilizes a [...] "multilayered arrangement... that sounds as if it were tailored for a Super Bowl halftime show". The song, along with [...] "Little Drummer Boy", begins with a rock-oriented opening before transitioning into a power ballad form.|$|E
500|$|Generally, modern 5November {{celebrations}} are run {{by local}} charities and other organisations, with paid admission and controlled access.

Author Martin Kettle, writing in The Guardian in 2003, bemoaned an [...] "occasionally nannyish" [...] attitude to fireworks that discourages people from holding firework displays in their back gardens, and an [...] "unduly sensitive attitude" [...] toward the anti-Catholic sentiment once so prominent on Guy Fawkes Night. David Cressy summarised the modern celebration with these words: [...] "The rockets go higher and burn with more colour, but they have less and less to do with memories of the Fifth of November... it might be observed that Guy Fawkes' Day is finally declining, having lost its connection with politics and religion.

500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the war, Elgar was in poor health. His wife {{thought it}} best for him to move to the countryside, and she rented 'Brinkwells', a house near Fittleworth in Sussex, from the painter Rex Vicat Cole. There Elgar {{recovered}} his strength and, in 1918 and 1919, he produced four large-scale works. The first three of these were chamber pieces: the Violin Sonata in Eminor, the Piano Quintet in A minor, and the String Quartet in E minor. On hearing the work in progress, Alice Elgar wrote in her diary, [...] "E. writing wonderful new music". All three works were well received. The Times wrote, [...] "Elgar's sonata contains much that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> before in other forms, but as we do not at all want him to change and be somebody else, that is as it should be." [...] The quartet and quintet were premiered at the Wigmore Hall on 21 May 1919. The Manchester Guardian wrote, [...] "This quartet, with its tremendous climaxes, curious refinements of dance-rhythms, and its perfect symmetry, and the quintet, more lyrical and passionate, are as perfect examples of chamber music as the great oratorios were of their type." ...|$|E
500|$|Viking raids {{increased}} in the early 840s {{on both sides of}} the English Channel, and in 843 Æthelwulf was defeated by the companies of 35 Danish ships at Carhampton in Somerset. In 850 sub-king Æthelstan and Ealdorman Ealhhere of Kent won a naval victory over a large Viking fleet off Sandwich in Kent, capturing nine ships and driving off the rest. Æthelwulf granted Ealhhere a large estate in Kent, but Æthelstan is not heard of again, and probably died soon afterwards. The following year the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records five different attacks on southern England. A Danish fleet of 350 Viking ships took London and Canterbury, and when King Berhtwulf of Mercia went to their relief he was defeated. The Vikings then moved on to Surrey, where they were defeated by Æthelwulf and his son Æthelbald at the Battle of Aclea. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle the West Saxon levies [...] "there made the greatest slaughter of a heathen that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> tell of up to the present day". The Chronicle frequently reported victories during Æthelwulf's reign won by levies led by ealdormen, unlike the 870s when royal command was emphasised, reflecting a more consensual style of leadership in the earlier period.|$|E
500|$|Foreign Minister Count Ulrich von Brockdorff-Rantzau {{headed the}} 180-strong German peace delegation. They {{departed}} Berlin on 18 April 1919, anticipating {{that the peace}} talks would soon start and that they and the Allied Powers would negotiate a settlement. Earlier, in February of that year, Brockdorff-Rantzau had informed the Weimar National Assembly that Germany {{would have to pay}} reparations for the devastation caused by the war, but would not pay for actual war costs. The German government had also taken the position that it would be [...] "inadvisable... to elevate the question of war guilt". On 5 May, Brockdorff-Rantzau was informed {{that there would be no}} negotiations. Once the German delegation received the conditions of peace they would have fifteen days to reply. Following the drafting of the treaty, on 7 May the German and Allied delegations met and the Treaty of Versailles was handed off to be translated and for a response to be issued. At this meeting Brockdorff-Rantzau stated that [...] "We know the intensity of the hatred which meets us, and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> the victors' passionate demand that as the vanquished we shall be made to pay, and as the guilty we shall be punished". However, he proceeded to deny that Germany was solely responsible for the war. Following the meeting, the German delegation retired to translate the 80,000 word document. As soon as the delegation realized the terms of peace, they agreed that they could not accept it without revision. They then proceeded to send their Allied counterparts, message after message attacking each part of the treaty. On 18 June, having disregarded the repeated explicit decisions of the government, Brockdorff-Rantzau declared that Article 231 would have Germany accept full responsibility for the war by force. Max Weber, an advisor with the German delegation, agreed with Brockdorff-Rantzau, also challenging the Allies over the issue of war guilt. He preferred to reject the treaty than submit to what he called a [...] "rotten peace".|$|E
