5|$|Before marriage, women {{used to wear}} a Kirgi (sari) and Baju (blouse). The Kirgi is a {{piece of}} cloth not longer than four feet, and about three feet wide. It was <b>wrapped</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> body from the waist down. A jacket with long sleeves called a Baju, was used to cover {{the upper part of the}} body. This dress was a sign of the bride's virginity and was worn during the Ros ceremony. The Kirgi was <b>wrapped</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> waist, but the end of the sari is not thrown over the shoulder. To wear the sari with its end thrown over the shoulder, known as Worl, is the {{exclusive}} right of a married woman. Married women used to wear sarees the general way. The Salwar kameez is another form of popular dress for females. The Mangalorean Catholic bride's wedding sari is known as a Sado. It is usually a red-coloured Banarasi sari which is made of finely woven silk and is decorated with elaborate engravings. In olden days, the bride wore on her head a red cloth, three feet square. Gold ornaments were absent in those days: the bride went to the church dressed as a virgin girl. In modern times, the bride wears (in place of the Kirgi) a red sari, but the end of the sari is not thrown over the shoulder; it is <b>wrapped</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> waist. The bride wears a few gold ornaments, some rings on the fingers, earrings, and at least two of the Dantoni (golden combs). Other ornaments worn by the bride in the olden days included Kanti, Chakrasar, Kap, Karap, Mugud, Kanto, and Dantoni.|$|E

The acreage attached to the house Stowe purchased could produce an income of $2,000 a month ($ in 2009). Stowe wrote to author George Eliot to update her {{on the progress of}} improvements to the house in Mandarin, putting up wallpaper, improving plaster, and building a veranda that <b>wrapped</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> structure. She took pains not to disturb a giant oak and instead built the veranda around the tree. The house could accommodate as many as 17 family members and friends.|$|E
5|$|Ellie Victoria Cole {{was born}} in the Melbourne suburb of Lilydale on 12 December 1991. Her mother and {{grandfather}} were both swimmers, and her father was athletic. At two years of age, she was diagnosed with a rare tumour, a sarcoma that was <b>wrapped</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> nerves of her right leg. After unsuccessful attempts to treat her cancer with chemotherapy, her right leg was amputated above the knee on 14 February 1994. Eight weeks after the surgery, as part of her rehabilitation, Cole's mother Jenny enrolled her in swimming lessons. Cole's instructors expected her to take up to a year to learn how to swim in a straight line, but it took her two weeks.|$|E
5|$|Kratos' main {{weapon is}} the Blades of Chaos: {{a pair of}} blades {{attached}} to chains that are <b>wrapped</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> character's wrists and forearms. In gameplay, the blades can be swung offensively in various maneuvers. As the game progresses, Kratos acquires new weapons—the Sun Shield and Gauntlet of Zeus—offering alternative combat options. Kratos only learns three magical abilities, as opposed to four in previous installments, including the Efreet, the Light of Dawn, and Charon's Wrath, giving him {{a variety of ways}} to attack and kill enemies. He acquires the relic Triton's Lance—similar to Poseidon's Trident in God of War— which allows him to breathe underwater; a necessary ability as parts of the game require long periods of time there.|$|E

5|$|Kratos' main {{weapon is}} the Blades of Exile, {{replacing}} the Blades of Athena used in previous installments {{and the opening}} moments of this game. The weapon {{is a pair of}} blades that are attached to chains <b>wrapped</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> character's wrists and forearms, which can be swung in a number of maneuvers. During the game, Kratos acquires new weapons—the Claws of Hades, the Nemean Cestus, and the Nemesis Whip—with other combat options. The Nemean Cestus, a pair of gauntlets, and the Nemesis Whip, which is similar to the Blades of Exile, are required to advance in parts of the game; for example, the Nemean Cestus is needed to break through objects composed of onyx.|$|E
5|$|The barren desert {{surface of}} Ceti Alpha V was {{simulated}} on stage 8, the largest sound stage at Paramount's studio. The set was elevated 25 {{feet off the}} ground and covered in wooden mats, over which tons of colored sand and powder were dumped. A cyclorama was painted and <b>wrapped</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> set, while massive industrial fans created a sandstorm. The filming was uncomfortable for actors and crew alike. The spandex environmental suits Koenig and Winfield wore were unventilated, and the actors had to signal by microphone when they needed air. Filming equipment was wrapped in plastic to prevent mechanical troubles and everyone on set wore boots, masks, and coveralls as protection from flying sand.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 15. It traversed westward and entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on August 29. The system quickly developed deep convection and a low-level circulation, and on September 1 it organized into Tropical Depression Nine-E while located about 170miles (270km) off the southwest coast of Mexico. The depression initially moved west-northwestward, and shortly after forming it turned to the north-northwest. Under favorable conditions, the depression slowly strengthened to become Tropical Storm Henriette on September 2 while located 220miles (350km) west of Manzanillo. By later that day, the convection <b>wrapped</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> center of circulation. Henriette quickly organized and intensified into a hurricane on September 3 while located 135miles (235km) west-southwest of Puerto Vallarta in Jalisco. Upon reaching hurricane status, one computer model predicted Henriette to continue moving northward through the Gulf of California, though most forecast a turn to the northwest.|$|E

5|$|Also on {{show is a}} late 19th-century shambar (large veil) from Bayt Jibrin worn at {{weddings and}} festivals. It is made of {{embroidered}} handwoven black silk with a separate heavy red silk fringe. A woman wore the shambar mainly on her wedding day, positioned so that when she covered her face the embroidered end would show. Another item in the collection is a headdress (iraqiyeh) embroidered with cross-stitch and decorated with Ottoman coins minted in AH 1223 (1808), as well as Maria Theresa coins. The iraqiyeh was worn by married women and elaborate pieces were passed down as family heirlooms. Long embroidered headbands made of cotton hanging from both sides were <b>wrapped</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> woman's braids to facilitate the bundling of her hair, then secured {{to the back of}} the headdress.|$|E
5|$|An unusually small hurricane, with gale-force winds {{extending}} only 60mi (95km) {{from its}} center, Danny {{was prone to}} significant fluctuations in intensity, making forecasts particularly difficult. Indeed, the storm soon underwent an unpredicted period of rapid intensification aided by nearly non-existent upper-level wind shear. Low-level moisture <b>wrapped</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> circulation during this phase, mitigating {{the influence of the}} Saharan Air Layer. Danny achieved its peak intensity around 12:00UTC on August21 as a Category3 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale; maximum sustained winds were estimated at 125mph (205km/h) alongside a barometric pressure of 960mbar (hPa); 28.35inHg). Shortly thereafter, increasing shear and dry air initiated a rapid weakening phase. The storm's eye became obscured by clouds and disappeared from satellite image late on August21.|$|E
5|$|Classified as Tropical Depression Five-E, {{the system}} tracked westward under the {{steering}} currents of a mid-level ridge. In the hours after formation, the depression lacked {{a concentration of}} deep convection near the center. Conditions favored development, including warm sea surface temperatures, very low amounts of wind shear, and an established anticyclone over the cyclone. Convection became more centralized, coinciding with the improvement of upper-level outflow. Based on Dvorak classifications, {{it is estimated that}} the cyclone intensified into Tropical Storm Daniel at 1200UTC on July17. Daniel quickly became better organized, exhibiting increased thunderstorm activity and banding features. A central dense overcast developed, and a well-defined rainband <b>wrapped</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> center of circulation. Based on the formation of an eye feature, the National Hurricane Center upgraded Daniel to hurricane status late on July18 while it was located about 885miles (1420km) south-southwest of Cabo San Lucas.|$|E

5|$|During the {{following}} six hours, Urmil underwent explosive deepening {{as the main}} feeder band <b>wrapped</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> center of circulation. After the brief period of intensification, the storm reached its peak intensity with winds of 110km/h (70mph) according to both the RSMC Nadi and the JTWC, making it a high-end Category 2 cyclone on the Australian Scale. The highly favorable environment, {{in combination with the}} fast forward motion of the storm, allowed Urmil to rapidly reach its peak intensity, despite wind shear reaching 35km/h (25mph). However, as quickly as the storm strengthened, it began to weaken as convection weakened. With both wind shear and forward motion increasing, the cyclone quickly became disorganized. Around 0000UTC on January15, the center of circulation was devoid of shower and thunderstorm activity. About six hours later, Urmil transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and was subsequently absorbed into the mid-latitude westerlies.|$|E
5|$|In {{the center}} of the emblem sits a green outline of Belarus, {{superimposed}} over the rays of a golden sun. The sun is partially covered by a globe, with the landmass (part of Eurasia) in purple and waters in blue. Lining the left and right sides of the emblem are stalks of wheat, superimposed with flowers. Clovers adorn the left wheat stalks; flax flowers adorn the right. <b>Wrapped</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> wheat stalks is a red and green ribbon bearing the colours of the flag of Belarus; the ribbon meets {{at the base of the}} emblem, where the name Republic of Belarus (Рэспублiка Беларусь) is inscribed in gold in the Belarusian language.

5|$|Slow-motion {{photography}} {{shows that}} the muscles have passive flexibility. They are first stretched while the frog {{is still in the}} crouched position, then they are contracted before being stretched again to launch the frog into the air. The fore legs are folded against the chest and the hind legs remain in the extended, streamlined position {{for the duration of the}} jump. In some extremely capable jumpers, such as the Cuban tree frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis) and the northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens), the peak power exerted during a jump can exceed that which the muscle is theoretically capable of producing. When the muscles contract, the energy is first transferred into the stretched tendon which is <b>wrapped</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> ankle bone. Then the muscles stretch again at the same time as the tendon releases its energy like a catapult to produce a powerful acceleration beyond the limits of muscle-powered acceleration. A similar mechanism has been documented in locusts and grasshoppers.|$|E
