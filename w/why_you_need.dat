[...] Glenn Beck said on his internet television network GBTV, [...] "Capitalists, {{if you think}} that you can play footsies with these people, you are wrong.

60|$|Yes. Fancy {{not that}} any wishes or prayers of yours can persuade God to alter his {{everlasting}} laws {{of right and}} wrong.

Therefore if God has commanded you a thing, DO IT heartily, fully, without arguing or complaining. If you begin arguing with God's law, excusing yourself from it, inventing reasons <b>why</b> <b>YOU</b> <b>need</b> not obey it in this particular instance, though every one else ought, then you will end, like Balaam, in disobeying the law, and it will grind you to powder.|$|E

6000|$|Paul {{made his}} way into Mrs Hurtle's sitting-room and wrote a note for her in pencil. He had come, he said, {{immediately}} on his return from Liverpool, and was sorry to find that she was away for the day. When should he call again? If she would make an appointment he would attend to it. He felt as he wrote this that he might very safely have himself made an appointment for the morrow; but he cheated himself into half believing that the suggestion he now made was the more gracious and civil. At any rate it would certainly give him another day. Mrs Hurtle would not return till late in the evening, and as the following day was Sunday {{there would be no}} delivery by post. When the note was finished he left it on the table, and called to Ruby to tell her that he was going.

I'm sorry you'll not tarry here awhile. We don't see many lasses, especially any as pretty as you, and you'll find it more quiet and lonesome the farther West you get.
