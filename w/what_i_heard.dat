500|$|The {{writing of}} [...] "The Girl Is Mine" [...] was {{completed}} by Jackson as he watched cartoons with Paul McCartney. Producer Quincy Jones had initially told Jackson to write a song about two men fighting over a girl. Inspired, Jackson awoke during the night and sang the song into a tape recorder. He later said, [...] "I sang exactly <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> in my head, starting with the melody and the keyboard and the strings and everything. So, I just orally put it all on tape." [...] Jones also asked Jackson to add a rap verse. The song was then recorded by Jackson and McCartney at Westlake Studios, Los Angeles, from April 14 to 16, 1982. The year before, the duo had recorded [...] "Say Say Say" [...] and [...] "The Man" [...] for McCartney's fifth solo album, Pipes of Peace (1983).|$|E
500|$|On 8 June 2008, {{news reports}} {{indicated}} that Pratchett had an experience {{which he described}} as: [...] "It is just possible that once you have got past all the gods that we have created with big beards and many human traits, just beyond all that, {{on the other side}} of physics, there just may be the ordered structure from which everything flows" [...] and [...] "I don't actually believe in anyone who could have put that in my head". He went into further detail on Front Row, in which he was asked if this was a shift in his beliefs: [...] "A shift in me in the sense I heard my father talk to me when I was in the garden one day. But I'm absolutely certain that <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> was my memories of my father. An engram, or something in my head...This is not about God, but somewhere around there is where gods come from." ...|$|E
500|$|... "My other colleague, the {{ambassador}} Philippus Faxecura, after {{he reached his}} aforementioned king (Date Masamune), was greatly honored by him, and sent to his own estate, to rest after such a long and tiring journey, where he made his wife, children, servants, and many other vassals into Christians, and advised other nobles who were his kith and kin to accept the faith, which they indeed did. While he was engaged in these and other pious works, a full year after his return, having provided much instruction and a great example, with much preparation, he piously passed on, leaving for his children by a special inheritance the propagation of the faith in his estate, {{and the protection of}} the religious (i.e. [...] "members of religious orders") in that kingdom. The King and all the nobles were greatly saddened by his passing, but especially the Christians and Religious, who knew very well the virtue and religious zeal of this man. This is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> by letters from the very Religious who administered the sacraments to him, and who had been present at his death, as well as from others." [...] (Luis Sotelo, De ecclesiae Iaponicae statu relatio).|$|E

500|$|After the Beatles {{completed}} their second Hamburg residency, they enjoyed increasing popularity in Liverpool {{with the growing}} Merseybeat movement. However, they were also growing tired of the monotony of numerous appearances at the same clubs night after night. In November 1961, {{during one of the}} group's frequent performances at The Cavern Club, they encountered Brian Epstein, a local record-store owner and music columnist. He later recalled: [...] "I immediately liked <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard.</b> They were fresh, and they were honest, and they had what I thought was a sort of presence... star quality." [...] Epstein courted the band {{over the next couple of}} months, and they appointed him as their manager in January 1962. Throughout early and mid-1962, Epstein sought to free the Beatles from their contractual obligations to Bert Kaempfert Productions. He eventually negotiated a one-month-early release from their contract in exchange for one last recording session in Hamburg. Tragedy greeted them on their return to Germany in April, when a distraught Kirchherr met them at the airport with news of Sutcliffe's death the previous day from what would later be determined to have been a brain hemorrhage. Epstein began negotiations with record labels for a recording contract. In order to secure a UK record contract, Epstein negotiated an early end to the band's contract with Polydor, in exchange for more recordings backing Tony Sheridan. After a New Year's Day audition, Decca Records rejected the band with the comment [...] "Guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein." [...] However, three months later, producer George Martin signed the Beatles to EMI's Parlophone label.|$|E
500|$|Air story {{revolves}} around three girls {{whose lives are}} connected to the same man. In the first story arc, Dream, Yukito Kunisaki is a showman traveling across Japan, continuing his late mother's search for the [...] "girl in the sky".Translated quote: [...] "...at {{the far end of the}} sky, there is a girl who has wings...from the distant past...even now, she is still there. That is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> from my mother when I was small. Before I could ask more clearly, my mother died. After that, I continued journeying alone. The myth of the girl in the sky." [...] The story opens on Monday July 17, 2000 when Yukito comes across a small seaside town where the story takes place. On his first day in town, Yukito tries to earn money by putting on a mysterious puppet show where he manipulates a doll magically without strings for a small audience of kids passing by. Yukito is unsuccessful in gaining the children's favor, and the children leave without paying him for his performance. That night, Yukito sleeps on the town's seawall by the beach. Yukito collapses from heat stroke the next day and is taken to a nearby fisherman's guild; after he awakens, they feed him, and give him some very large rice balls to take with him as he is leaving. As he sits on the town's seawall eating one of the rice balls, he notices a young girl beside him who introduces herself as Misuzu Kamio—a sincere yet clumsy girl who is eager to become friends with him. Misuzu persistently attempts to play with him, while Yukito tries to refuse her efforts. He eventually follows her home lured by the chance to eat. After Haruko, Misuzu's aunt and foster mother, is persuaded, it is decided that he will stay with them for the time being.Translated quote: [...] "...I understand. Stay here. Sleep in the garage." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Rays lost {{starting}} {{second baseman}} Akinori Iwamura {{for the season}} to a leg injury that occurred on May 24 against the Florida Marlins. While Iwamura was {{making an effort to}} turn a double play, Marlins infielder Chris Coghlan awkwardly slid into Iwamura's leg in an attempt to disrupt the throw to first base. Iwamura fell to the ground and had to be taken off the field on a cart. The next day after an MRI, it was announced that he suffered a torn ACL, [...] "involvement" [...] on the MCL, in addition to torn ligaments in his ankle. Even before the announcement was made, hopes of a speedy recovery were not promising, as Iwamura was seen around the clubhouse on crutches [...] "saying goodbye", and as Rays shortstop Jason Bartlett put it, [...] "From <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard,</b> he's not going to be back soon." [...] Bartlett himself would be put on the disabled list one day later, with a sprained ankle.|$|E
2500|$|Williams was talented as a pilot, and so {{enjoyed it}} {{that he had to}} be ordered by the Navy to leave {{training}} to personally accept his American League 1942 Major League Baseball Triple Crown. Williams' Red Sox teammate, Johnny Pesky, who went into the same aviation training program, said this about Williams: [...] "He mastered intricate problems in fifteen minutes which took the average cadet an hour, and half of the other cadets there were college grads." [...] Pesky again described Williams' acumen in the advance training, for which Pesky personally did not qualify: [...] "I heard Ted literally tore the sleeve target to shreds with his angle dives. He'd shoot from wingovers, zooms, and barrel rolls, and after a few passes the sleeve was ribbons. At any rate, I know he broke the all-time record for hits." [...] Ted went to Jacksonville for a course in aerial gunnery, the combat pilot's payoff test, and broke all the records in reflexes, coordination, and visual-reaction time. [...] "From <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard.</b> Ted could make a plane and its six 'pianos' (machine guns) play like a symphony orchestra", Pesky says. [...] "From what they said, his reflexes, coordination, and visual reaction made him a built-in part of the machine." ...|$|E
