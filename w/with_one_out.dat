5|$|Humber nearly {{achieved}} a no hitter for the 2011 Chicago White Sox twice. On April 25, 2011, {{in the sixth}} start of his career, he took a no-hitter into the seventh inning against the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium but, <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>out,</b> Alex Rodriguez singled up the middle, leaving Humber to finish with seven scoreless innings. Later that year he took a no-hitter into the sixth inning against the Washington Nationals on June 26, but ended up earning a 2–1 loss when he surrendered a seventh inning home run to Danny Espinosa. In that contest, Jerry Hairston, Jr. broke up the no-hitter leading off the sixth after Roger Bernadina earned a hit by pitch {{to break up the}} perfect game in the fourth.|$|E
5|$|Just as Herzog had {{predicted}} {{when he told}} Smith the Cardinals would win the pennant {{with him on the}} team, Smith found himself as the team's starting shortstop in the best-of-seven 1982 World Series against the Milwaukee Brewers.

When St. Louis was trailing 3–1 <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>out</b> in the sixth inning of Game 7, Smith started a rally with a base hit to left field, eventually scoring the first of the team's three runs that inning. The Cardinals scored two more runs in the 8th inning for a 6-3 win and the championship.|$|E

Dodgers starter Danny McDevitt held the Braves scoreless in the first inning, but was driven from {{the game in the}} second. After a line out to open the inning Johnny Logan walked, Del Crandall singled, and Bill Bruton singled to bring home Logan and tie the game at 1. Larry Sherry entered in relief of McDevitt, who pitched just 1 innings. Carl Willey, the Braves' pitcher, reached base on an error to load the bases. Crandall then scored on a ground out by Bobby Ávila to give the Braves a 2–1 lead before Sherry finished out the second.|$|E
5|$|Desmond Jennings {{opened the}} first inning with a single, but was thrown out at second base trying to stretch the hit into a double. Wil Myers then walked, {{advanced}} to third base on singles by Ben Zobrist and Evan Longoria, and finally scored on a sacrifice fly by Delmon Young. Rays starter David Price struck out leadoff batter Ian Kinsler, then allowed a walk to Elvis Andrus but picked him off and finished the inning by retiring Alex Ríos. The score remained 1–0 until {{the top of the}} third inning, when Jennings drew a walk and scored on a home run by Longoria to give the Rays a 3–0 lead. The Rangers struck right back in the bottom half, as Craig Gentry led off the inning with a single. After advancing to second on a Leonys Martín groundout, he scored on a single to right field by Kinsler. The Rays scored again in the sixth, as Longoria doubled to lead off the inning, and advanced to third base on a groundout by Young.

On December 17, he won the This Year in Baseball Setup Man of the Year Award.|$|E
5|$|Game 3 {{matched the}} Giants' Juan Marichal against Johnny Podres, though Dodgers' manager Walt Alston had {{considered}} starting reliever Larry Sherry. The pair kept the game scoreless through two innings before the Giants opened the scoring {{in the top}} of the third. José Pagán singled to lead off the inning, Marichal reached on a throwing error by the pitcher on a throw to second base which allowed Pagán to move to third, and Pagán scored on a Harvey Kuenn single. Then, while Chuck Hiller was batting, John Roseboro made an error in attempting to pickoff Marichal on second base, allowing him to advance to third. Hiller hit a fly ball to shallow left field and Marichal held at third base. Left fielder Duke Snider threw home but the ball was cut off by the third baseman, who threw to second to try to catch Kuenn in a rundown between first and second. However, the second baseman's throw to first hit Kuenn in the back, leaving him safe at first and allowing Marichal to score, to make the game 2–0. Felipe Alou then singled, Kuenn went to third, and Alou advanced to second on the throw. Podres intentionally walked Willie Mays to load the bases <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>out,</b> and induced a double play from Orlando Cepeda to end the inning.|$|E
5|$|Granderson led off {{the first}} inning with a home run for the Mets, and scored the Mets' second run in the sixth inning. The Mets {{had a chance to}} break the game open in that sixth inning as they loaded the bases with no outs, but had to settle for one run after Céspedes lined a foul ball off his leg and was injured, leaving the game after popping up for the first out of the inning. Duda hit a {{sacrifice}} fly before d'Arnaud grounded out to end the inning. Harvey pitched eight shutout innings for the Mets, and convinced Collins to keep him in the game for the ninth. He then gave up a leadoff walk to Cain in the ninth inning, and the Royals got a run when Hosmer drove Cain in with a double, prompting Collins to call upon Familia to relieve Harvey. After a groundout by Moustakas advanced Hosmer to third base <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>out,</b> Pérez hit a ground ball to third baseman Wright, who after checking Hosmer at third, threw to first base for the second out; however, Hosmer broke for home as soon as the ball was thrown, and Duda, who fielded the out at first, threw wide at home attempting to throw Hosmer out, and the latter scored the tying run, resulting in Familia blowing his third save of the postseason and the series; his eight save opportunities tied the postseason record set in 2002 by Robb Nen.|$|E

Édgar Rentería singled towards Ramírez in left field, who unintentionally kicked the ball away, {{allowing}} Jason Marquis to score. Walker also hit the ball towards Ramírez in the next at bat. Ramírez slid in an attempt to try to catch the ball, but tripped and deflected the ball for his second error in two plays, and the fourth Red Sox error in the game. Roger Cedeño scored on the play to tie the game at nine. In the bottom of the eighth inning, however, Jason Varitek reached on an error, and Bellhorn then hit a home run off the right field foul pole, also known as Pesky's Pole, for his third home run in as many games to give the Red Sox a two-run lead. In the ninth inning, Foulke struck out Cedeño to win the game for the Red Sox 11–9.|$|E

In the fourth inning, three players hit singles but did not score. Snider doubled in the fifth inning <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>out,</b> and a Jackie Robinson single made the score 3–0 for the Dodgers. The inning ended for the Dodgers on a double play, and Don Mueller hit a single {{in the bottom of}} the fifth before the Giants recorded three straight outs. The Dodgers opened up the game in the sixth inning, as Hodges led off with a home run. Billy Cox then reached base on an error and scored on a second error to make the game 5–0.

5|$|The Astros' Joe Niekro retired the Dodgers {{in order}} {{in the first and}} second innings.

Niekro allowed two successive singles to lead off the bottom of the inning, but proceeded to retire three straight Dodgers without allowing either runner to score. The Astros further added to their lead in the fourth, as Puhl singled on a bunt to third base and then stole second and third base while Cabell batted. Both he and Morgan walked to load the bases <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>out.</b> Puhl scored on a Cruz sacrifice fly, Cedeño walked to re-load the bases, and finally a Howe single gave the Astros another two runs to make the game 7–0.|$|E

O'Farrell {{followed}} and hit a ground ball towards Koenig that he bobbled, enabling O'Farrell and Hafey to reach first and second base, respectively. Tommy Thevenow followed with a double to right field that got by Meusel, scoring Hafey and moving O'Farrell to third base. Cardinals' manager Rogers Hornsby then put in left-handed infielder Specs Toporczer to pinch hit for Rhem, who was done pitching for the game. Toporczer hit a fly ball to Earle Combs in center field, upon which O'Farrell promptly tagged up to score another Cardinal run. With the game tied at three apiece and a runner at second base, Douthit hit a double in the outfield, which scored Thevenow. Southworth followed with a single to left fielder Ruth, and Douthit immediately tried to score. Ruth threw from left field to catcher Hank Severeid, who tagged Douthit out at home plate.|$|E
5|$|The Cardinals {{were leading}} the Yankees 3–0 {{by the end}} of the inning. The Yankees failed to produce any offense in the fifth inning, but the Cardinals added to their lead by picking up a run when Billy Southworth beat the tag at home {{following}} a Jim Bottomley grounder to second base. Ruether was then replaced by Bob Shawkey, who closed out the inning by yielding two weak infield groundouts. The Yankees picked up one hit in each of the next two innings, but could not produce any runs. Yankees pitcher Myles Thomas came in to pitch a hitless ninth inning. <b>With</b> <b>one</b> <b>out</b> in the top of the ninth inning, Lou Gehrig hit a line drive single into right field, but Lazzeri grounded into a double play, ending the game as a 4–0 Cardinals victory. Haines pitched a complete game shutout, and only gave up five hits total, two of which came from Gehrig.|$|E
5|$|The Dodgers re-tied {{the game}} the next inning, however. Neal singled <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>out</b> and Wally Moon {{grounded}} into a force out at second base. Moon then advanced to second on a Larker single and scored on a Gil Hodges single to make the score 2–2. Don Demeter hit a single, the third consecutive and fourth of the inning, to load the bases but John Roseboro flew out to end the inning without further scoring. Sherry held the Braves scoreless {{in the bottom of}} the third, opening the inning with a walk but then inducing a double play and a foul out to quickly close it. Sherry and Willey traded scoreless innings in the fourth and fifth although the Braves threatened against Sherry in both innings, allowing two base-runners each time but escaping with no runs. Roseboro led off the top of the sixth inning with a home run to give the Dodgers a 3–2 lead. Roseboro had also hit a home run the day before against the Chicago Cubs, a game the Dodgers won to force the tie-breaker. Willey put out the next three batters to quickly end the inning, but the damage had been done.|$|E

5|$|The Giants scored {{first for}} the second {{consecutive}} game, as Orlando Cepeda singled <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>out</b> in the second inning and scored on a double by Felipe Alou against Dodgers' starter Don Drysdale. The Giants then extended their lead {{in the top of the}} sixth inning. Alou struck out to open the inning but Tom Haller then walked and advanced to third base on a double by José Pagán. Giants' starter Jack Sanford then reached based on a throwing error by Drysdale, which also allowed Haller to score and advanced Pagán to third base. Chuck Hiller and Jim Davenport followed this with successive singles which scored Pagán and Sanford respectively. This made the score 4–0 in favor of the Giants with Hiller on second and Sanford on first, still with only one out in the inning. Ed Roebuck entered in relief of Drysdale, inducing an out at second base on a groundball by Willie Mays, to leave runners at the corners with two outs. Willie McCovey singled, allowing Hiller to score and make the game 5–0; Cepeda was then retired to end the inning.|$|E

Mark Teixeira tied the game with a solo home run in the fourth inning, and Hideki Matsui broke the tie in the sixth with another, giving the Yankees their first lead. Chan Ho Park allowed an RBI single to Jorge Posada after Martínez put two baserunners on {{in the top of the}} seventh. Burnett departed after seven innings, replaced by Mariano Rivera in the eighth. The Phillies put two runners on with a walk to Jimmy Rollins and a single by Shane Victorino <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>out</b> in the eighth.
