5|$|In 1990, media mogul Ted Turner {{announced}} he would begin colourising black-and-white motion pictures {{to make them more}} pleasing to audiences watching his cable networks. The announcement generated extensive controversy. Touring Turner's colourisation facilities {{as a member of the}} Directors Guild, Wise learned that Turner was colourising The Haunting. Wise was able to prevent the colourisation by pointing to his contract, <b>which</b> <b>stated</b> <b>the</b> picture could only be in black-and-white.|$|E

Munyonga was Zambia's oldest athlete at the London Olympic Games, at age 31, and was taking part in his first Olympic Games. He {{said that he would}} do his best in the event. Munyonga faced Takahiro Nakai of Japan on 31 July in the round of 32. When the ball rang to signal the start of the match, Munyonga held Nakai by the leg and placed him onto the corners of the mat. The primary umpire signalled the boxers to face each other and disqualified Munyonga and declared Nakai the match's winner. Munyonga stated that he regretted the move and that he had forgotten about a rule <b>which</b> <b>stated</b> <b>the</b> leg was not allowed to be held by another competitor.|$|E

500|$|A {{newsletter}} dated 4 April 1461 {{reported a}} widely circulated figure of 28,000casualties in the battle, which Charles Ross and other historians believe was exaggerated.

500|$|In the end, Secretary Chao heeded the Republican letter's arguments, and {{deferred}} {{the grant}} {{in a letter}} written by FTA Executive Director Matthew Welbes to Caltrain <b>which</b> <b>stated</b> <b>the</b> FTA needed [...] "additional time to complete review of this significant commitment of Federal resources". Caltrain had expected Secretary Chao to approve the grant and sign the grant agreement by March 1, which is normally a pro forma step performed after the thirty-day comment period for a highly-rated project, and had already awarded construction contracts. Balfour Beatty Construction and Stadler Rail had already begun preparations to upgrade the existing tracks and build electrical trainsets, respectively. Caltrain negotiated an emergency four-month contract extension at a potential cost of $20 million. Under the preliminary budget proposal released in mid-March 2017, the United States Department of Transportation's Capital Investment Grant Program would be eliminated, although approved projects {{would continue to be}} funded.

500|$|Beginning in mid–1960, but greatly {{accelerating}} in {{the summer}} of 1961, great numbers of Cuban anarchists migrated to the United States. That summer, in New York, the Movimiento Libertario Cubano en el Exilio (Cuban Libertarian Movement in Exile [...] ) was formed by some of these exiles, making contact with Spanish anarchists exiled following the Spanish Civil War, who were also living in New York. They also made contact with Sam Dolgoff and the New York-based Libertarian League. [...] "A Clarification and a Declaration of the Cuban Libertarians", a document by Gaona and signed by several other prominent anarchists, excoriated the libertarian press and advocated for the adoption of Castroism. In response to the widespread effect of the manifesto, the MLCE issued the Boletín de Información Libertaria with support from the Libertarian League, and the paper of the Federación Libertaria Argentina (FLA). Among many others, the FLA printed an essay by Abelardo Iglesias titled Revolución y Contrarevolución <b>which</b> <b>stated</b> <b>the</b> differences the Cuban anarchists saw between Marxist and anarchist revolution: [...] "To expropriate capitalist enterprises, handing them over to the workers and technicians, THIS IS REVOLUTION.

500|$|Upon {{the finish}} {{of the race}} there was a dispute over the winning time of Secretariat.

The official fractional times were 25, , 1:12, and 1:, while the Daily Racing Forum timed the fractions at , 47, 1:, and 1:. The next day, Secretariat's trainer Lucien Laurin asked for the videotape to be reviewed because he felt that if Secretariat did run that fast, then [...] "he deserves the record." [...] On May 21, race officials adjusted Secretariat's winning time to 1:, becoming the then second fastest time in race history. The time was changed to the time obtained by the official Pimilico timekeeper E.T. McLean per Rule 383 of the Maryland Rules of Racing, <b>which</b> <b>stated</b> <b>the</b> [...] "official timer's time is official." [...] McLean's stopwatch was faster than the Visumatic by three-fifths of a second at each fractional." [...] That same day, a Visumatic official checked the timer and stated that the timer should have actually read 1:, rather than 1:55. It was determined that the chart for the Preakness would display McLean's time as the winning time, with the Daily Racing Forum time written next to it, in parenthesis.|$|E

500|$|A Roman road {{passed through}} the village {{although}} there are no visible signs of its existence. Both Roman and Mesolithic remains have been found in nearby Shortheath Common, including a large Roman hoard of 11,000 silver pieces. The village name has been spelled in various ways, including Acangre (10th century), Hohangra (early 12th century), Ochangra, Achangre, and Hachangre (late 12th century). Although the area has been settled since the Iron Age, the first mention of Oakhanger itself was in a charter from the early 10th century, <b>which</b> <b>stated</b> <b>the</b> boundaries of lands granted by Edward of Wessex to Frithestan, the Bishop of Winchester. In the reign of Edward the Confessor the lands of Oakhanger were assessed to be worth 40 shillings. At the time of the Domesday Survey in 1086, Oakhanger was held by Edwin, who had purchased it from Richard I. The identity of Edwin is unclear, however during the 12th century the manor was evidently held by a family that took the surname of Oakhanger – thus William de Oakhanger was in possession of the village in 1167. In 1250 James de Oakhanger, the grandson of William de Oakhanger, was inheritated the lands of the village until ownership was passed down to his son in 1279. [...] William who died without children in 1317, leaving his brother John Paynel as his heir. Paynel died two years later, leaving his daughter Maud, the wife of Nicholas de Upton, heir to two parts of Oakhanger.|$|E
