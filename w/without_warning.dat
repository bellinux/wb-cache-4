5|$|Occasionally {{there had}} been a muffled thud or deadened {{explosion}} within the ship. Now, <b>without</b> <b>warning</b> she seemed to start forward, moving forward and into the water at an angle of about fifteen degrees.

5|$|Along with Oppenheimer, Compton, and Ernest Lawrence, Fermi {{was part}} of the {{scientific}} panel that advised the Interim Committee on target selection.

Fermi did not believe that atomic bombs would deter nations from starting wars, nor did he think that the time was ripe for world government. He therefore did not join the Association of Los Alamos Scientists.|$|E
50|$|Refusal {{to carry}} out lawful and {{reasonable}} instructions can be enough, unless it effectively changes the employee's job description {{so much that he}} can claim the instruction was unreasonable or even amounted to constructive dismissal. The more fundamental the instruction the greater the need for the employee to comply, e.g. the employee must work on a different floor in the same building if asked, but failure to take the rubbish out at the traditional time will not cut it <b>without</b> <b>warnings</b> and frequent re-offending.|$|R
40|$|A firm {{rather than}} a {{friendly}} interviewer demeanour may make interviewees more likely to alter their initial responses to questions during requestioning. Conversely, warnings that an interviewer may attempt to be misleading may lower interviewees' trust, heightening their vigilance and accuracy. Participants were tested under one of four conditions: 'Friendly' or 'Firm' interviewer demeanour, with or <b>without</b> <b>warnings</b> to be vigilant under questioning. The Gudjonsson Suggestibility Scale 2 (GSS 2) was adapted to include only questions which were not overtly leading, based on each scale's narrative. The standard GSS 'Shift', 'Memory Recall', and 'Total Confabulation' scores were calculated for each condition. Interviewees {{were most likely to}} alter their initial answers to questions when the interviewer adopted a Firm demeanour, <b>without</b> a <b>warning</b> to be vigilant. These findings support the predictions of the Gudjonsson and Clark (1986) model of interrogative suggestibility which relate to the effects of interrogative pressure...|$|R

The Covenant begin to hunt down human colonies, vitrifying the surface of each world.
