6000|$|She drank tea, {{and pulled}} herself {{together}} for a lively description of the <b>wheel-locking</b> and the subsequent conversation, a bright ridiculous account which made the affair happen by implication on the high road {{and not in a}} byeway, and was adorned with every facetious ornament that seemed likely to get a laugh from the children. But she talked rather fast, and she felt she forced the fun a little. However, it amused the children all right, and Theodore created a diversion by choking with his tea. From first to last Marjorie was extremely careful to avoid the affectionate scrutiny of her mother's eye. And had this lasted the whole afternoon? asked Mrs. Pope. [...] "Oh, they'd talked for half-an-hour," [...] said Marjorie, or more, and had driven back very slowly together. [...] "He did all the talking. You saw what he was yesterday. And the donkeys seemed too happy together to tear them away." ...|$|E
40|$|Antilock Braking System (ABS) is an {{important}} active safety feature in preventing accidents during emergency braking. Electrified vehicles which include both hydraulic and regenerative braking systems provide the opportunity to implement brake torque blending during slip control operation. This study evaluates the design and implementation of a new torque allocation algorithm using a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) strategy that can run in real-time, with results showing that <b>wheel-locking</b> can be prevented while also permitting for energy recuperation...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIntelligent systems {{designed}} to reduce highway fatalities have been widely applied in the automotive sector in the last decade. Of all users of transport systems, pedestrians are the most vulnerable in crashes as they are unprotected. This paper deals with an autonomous intelligent emergency system {{designed to}} avoid collisions with pedestrians. The system consists of a fuzzy controller based on the time-to-collision estimate - obtained via a vision-based system - and the <b>wheel-locking</b> probability - obtained via the vehicle's CAN bus - that generates a safe braking action. The system has been tested in a real car - a convertible CitroÃ«n C 3 Pluriel - equipped with an automated electro-hydraulic braking system capable of working in parallel with the vehicle's original braking circuit. The system {{is used as a}} last resort in the case that an unexpected pedestrian is in the lane and all the warnings have failed to produce a response from the driver...|$|E
