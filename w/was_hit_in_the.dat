5|$|According to The Pride of the Yankees, the 1942 {{film about}} Gehrig's life, Pipp asked {{out of the}} game because he was {{experiencing}} double vision from being hit in the head two days prior. By 1953, Pipp reported to The New York Times that he was taken out of the lineup due to being hit in the head by a pitch thrown by Charlie Caldwell during batting practice. However, while Pipp <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> head by a pitch from Caldwell and was hospitalized, this event occurred on July 2, a month after Pipp's benching.|$|E

Bresnahan was unconscious, and a Catholic priest read him his last rites. Bresnahan was hospitalized for ten days, during which time he developed schematics for a plastic batting helmet, though this piece of equipment did not become commonplace until the 1940s.

During the battle Dundas <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> leg when a cannon round exploded in his cockpit, but flew again the next day.

5|$|In Philadelphia itself, the {{combination}} of snow and sleet closed many of the schools, delayed flights, trains and buses. The school district parochial schools were closed on the 14th, as were the regional and central administrative offices. During the midday hours on the 14th, giant slabs of ice slid off tops of buildings in Center City and crashed to the ground. Chunks of ice as large as three feet wide {{made their way to}} the pavement from high up.

5|$|The Cubs {{began playing}} under the College of Coaches in 1961, {{a system in}} which {{decisions}} were made by a group of 12 coaches rather than by one manager. By the 1962 season, Banks hoped to return to shortstop but the College of Coaches had determined that he would remain at first base indefinitely. In May 1962, Banks <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> head by a fastball from former Cubs pitcher Moe Drabowsky and was taken off the field unconscious. He sustained a concussion, spent two nights in a hospital, sat out a Monday game, and hit three home runs and a double on Tuesday.|$|E

5|$|Bleak then {{returned}} to the patrol and attempted to treat more wounded members, but soon thereafter a Chinese hand grenade bounced off the helmet of the soldier standing next to him and landed nearby. Bleak tackled the soldier over and covered him with his larger frame to protect him from the grenade, but neither was injured in the ensuing blast. The patrol then continued on its mission, and was successful in capturing several Chinese prisoners. However, as it descended Hill 499 to return to UN lines, they were ambushed by another group of Chinese hidden in a trench with an automatic weapon. Three of the other soldiers were wounded in the attack, and as Bleak attempted to run to them, he <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> leg. Bleak dressed all four wounds, but one of the men had been hit too critically to move. In spite of continued Chinese fire and his own injury, Bleak picked up the wounded soldier and began to carry him down the hill.|$|E
5|$|His initial {{appearance}} of the 1914season was in relief on April 17, {{a game in which}} he pitched 4innings, and gave up three runs in 6–5victory over the Reds. He followed that with two consecutive strong games as the starting pitcher, allowing just one unearned run in each game; the second was a complete game against the Reds. On June12, he started the game against New York, only to be injured in the third inning when he <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hand by a ball batted by Fred Merkel, and had to leave the game. The injury did not cause Lavender to lose much playing time. He pitched a four-inning relief appearance on June19, followed by a complete game shutout on June27 against the Reds. On August17, he pitched a second shutout during the season, a 3-0victory over the Brooklyn Robins.|$|E
