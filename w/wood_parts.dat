5|$|The Amylostereaceae {{are white}} rot pathogens. They {{disintegrate}} the lignin {{of the host}} wood, whereby the infested <b>wood</b> <b>parts</b> become less stable and take a fibrous structure. The wood bleaches as fungal enzymes break down and remove the brown-pigmented lignin. The distribution in wood takes place mainly along the transport channels in the xylem. If the wood is crosscut, the red rot is vertically positioned, on which bleached, infested areas contrast with intact wood. Symptoms of infestion by the symbiotic partner—wood wasps—include circular exit holes in the crust and acute stress through dryness, common in hanging, falling or tanning needles.|$|E
25|$|In January 2009, a heavy {{snowfall}} {{snapped off}} the aircraft's left wing. Despite {{the efforts of}} Museum staff to clear the accumulating snow, the wing's internal structure failed and the wing separated from the fuselage, falling onto a display case containing one of the aircraft's original engines. The wing suffered considerable damage and there was additional damage to the tail and propeller. The wing had largely been restored using <b>wood</b> <b>parts</b> {{because most of the}} metal parts of the wing structure had been eroded, so it did not possess the structural integrity of the original aircraft. The museum is currently seeking donations to repair the aircraft. The repairs, in 2011, included the mating of the wing and propeller to the fuselage and engine. As of November 2013, the repairs to the CMF Handley Page Hampden have been completed. The wing has been re-secured and the complete aircraft has been repainted. By 20 April 2015 the two gunner sections were open.|$|E
2500|$|The unique {{environmental}} {{pressures of the}} Hunter Valley also conspire to give growers problem with [...] "dieback diseases" [...] that damage the <b>wood</b> <b>parts</b> of the vine and eventually lead to death. While the fungus Eutypa lata {{is present in the}} Hunter, research in the 2000s indicated that another pathogenic species related to Botryosphaeria is also present in the area. Semillon vines, in particular seem to be susceptible to Botryosphaeria (also known as bot canker) while, conversely, Eutypa dieback is rarely observed in the variety. Vines suffering from Eutypa die-back and bot canker exhibit similar wood symptoms and similarly experiences reduce growth and yields. A major difference between the two is that bot canker do not exhibit the same outward foliage symptoms that Eutypa die-back leave on the leaves and buds of the vine.|$|E

2500|$|Anglo-French attacks {{had been}} {{expected}} on 23 September, rather than 25 September and {{the timing of the}} attack for the afternoon, also wrong-footed some of the defenders. The 51st and 52nd Reserve divisions of the XXVI Reserve Corps were quickly pushed back, part of the 236th Reserve Regiment being [...] "destroyed" [...] at the tram line north of Bouleaux <b>Wood.</b> <b>Parts</b> of the 235th Reserve Regiment west of Combles and the 234th Reserve Regiment in the village, were threatened with encirclement by the British from the north and the French in the south. A battalion of the 239th Reserve Regiment of the 52nd Reserve Division was cut off in Morval and part of the regiment was overwhelmed north of the village near Lesbœufs. The rest of Lesbœufs, held by the 240th Reserve Regiment from the same division fell easily. Parts of the 51st and 52nd Reserve divisions counter-attacked Morval but were only able to advance a short distance and cover the withdrawal of their artillery, eventually forming new a line along the Le Transloy road [...] east of Morval.|$|E

50|$|This must {{be taken}} into account when joining <b>wood</b> <b>parts</b> together, {{otherwise}} the joint is destined to fail. Gluing boards with the grain running perpendicular to each other is often the reason for split boards, or broken joints. Furniture from the 18th century, while made by master craftsmen, did not take this into account. The result is this masterful work suffers from broken bracket feet, which was often attached with a glue block which ran perpendicular to the base pieces. The glue blocks were fastened with both glue and nails, resulting in unequal expansion and contraction between the pieces. This was also the cause of splitting of wide boards, which were commonly used during that period.|$|E

40|$|Acacia mangium is {{an exotic}} species grows wildly and widely planted and in Malaysia, {{in an effort}} for {{reforestation}} and also known {{to be used in}} pulp, furniture and paper industries. The objectives {{of this study is to}} detennine ﬁve (5) chemical properties (extractives, holocellulose, α-cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin) in three (3) portions (bottom, middle and top), and also two (2) <b>parts</b> (<b>wood</b> and bark) of small diameter wild Acacia mangium. Samples was collected from Bandar Jeli, approximately 10 kilometres from UMK Jeli campus, Kelantan with DBH around 5 - 8 cm. Samples are then ground using laboratory grade mill into powder form for chemical analysis. All analysis were done according to TAPPI standard method, except hemicellulose, which data was collected through equation. All data and results were statistically analysed using two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s Post Hoc test. Results acquired reveals that extractives content is the highest in bottom portion, bark part (15. 03 %). Highest holocellulose percentage can be found in top portion of <b>wood</b> <b>part</b> (85. 99 %). Highest α-cellulose content is in top portion of <b>wood</b> <b>part</b> (49. 84 %). Highest hemicellulose content can be found in top portion of <b>wood</b> <b>part</b> (36. 15 %). Lignin percentage is the highest in bottom portion of bark part (31. 18 %).
