[...] In the September 1966 issue of the Sporting News, Timberlake lamented: [...] "I’m not doing anything. [...] For four days the other <b>week,</b> <b>I</b> didn’t throw a single pass.

500|$|Hershey's acting debut, three {{episodes of}} Gidget, was {{followed}} by the short-lived television series The Monroes (1966), which also featured Michael Anderson, Jr. By this point, she had adopted the stage name [...] "Barbara Hershey". Although Hershey said the series helped her career, she expressed some frustration with her role, saying: [...] "One <b>week</b> <b>I</b> was strong, the next, weak". While on the series, Hershey garnered several other roles, including one in Doris Day's final feature film, With Six You Get Eggroll.|$|E
500|$|... "So I {{head out}} there and he plays me the track and it sounds exactly like how {{you want it to}} sound: forward moving, interesting, light-hearted, heavy-hearted, fucking {{incredible}} sounding jam. It was kind of bare so I added some choir-sounding stuff and then thicked out the samples with my voice. That whole first <b>week</b> <b>I</b> was there we worked on the 'Woods' song, which is called 'Lost in the World'. We were just eating breakfast and listening to the song on the speakers and he's like, 'Fuck, {{this is going to be}} the festival closer.' I was like, 'Yeah, cool.' It kind of freaked me out." ...|$|E

Rumors of a sex tape involving Conrad and Wahler, in addition to stories alleging that she invaded his house to retrieve it, surfaced in April 2007. Conrad adamantly denied both reports, commenting that [...] "if I ever tried to get something back from Jason, it was probably just photo albums and stuff" [...] and the producers [...] "videotape my life five days out of the <b>week.</b> <b>I</b> don't need additional footage, you know?" ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Watson left the P-I after he {{believed}} he was treated unfairly by a new editor, although he still contributed to the paper as a freelancer. Watson's criticisms of then Mariners owner George Argyros {{eventually led to the}} P-I reducing the frequency of his column. Watson remembered, [...] "I picked up the paper and saw the column wasn't in there. The managing editor called and said he was thinking of cutting me back to one column a <b>week.</b> <b>I</b> said maybe we should make it zero columns a week." [...] On October 30, 1983, after a hiatus of more than three decades, Watson's column appeared once again in The Seattle Times.|$|E
500|$|Kevin Shirley, who {{has worked}} with the bands Iron Maiden and Dream Theater, {{produced}} the DVD. He issued a statement describing the demanding mixing process which took place at his New York Studio: [...] "It's OK — some places it rocks hard, and others are a bit sloppy, but I'm sure they won't use the whole concert. It was tough to mix." [...] The following day Shirley apologized for his [...] "unprofessional comment" [...] towards the band, and altered his post on his personal website to read: [...] "The rest of the <b>week</b> <b>I</b> finished mixing a live Slayer set for a DVD, in stereo and surround, and it's great — it rocks hard, but it was tough to mix." ...|$|E

[...] During Joe Biden's 2008 campaign to be the Democratic nominee, she continued to teach during the week and would join him for campaigning on weekends.

She also said that she was basically apolitical and would not seek inclusion in Cabinet meetings.|$|E
500|$|Friday {{was arrested}} after the evening match away at Newport County on 20 October, {{accused of using}} obscene {{language}} outside a Newport nightclub. At his appearance before magistrates in Newport on 17 November, he pleaded not guilty, representing himself, and was acquitted. Performing strongly for Reading and scoring regularly, he began to attract serious interest from other clubs. [...] "Friday is, of course, much more than Reading's top scorer and best striker", wrote the Evening Post on 3 November 1975. [...] "He is the most vital cog in the team, and last <b>week</b> <b>I</b> understand Reading turned down a £60,000 bid from Cardiff City involving Welsh international Derek Showers". By the new year, Reading were third in the table, on course for promotion and two points behind league leaders Lincoln City.|$|E

An image of Rodemeyer was shown on the backdrop as Gaga announced: [...] "We lost a Little Monster this <b>week.</b> <b>I</b> wrote this record about how your identity is really all you've got when you're in school... so tonight, Jamey, I know you're up there looking at us, and you're not a victim... you're a lesson to all of us.

500|$|These {{themes and}} subtexts were {{highlighted}} by the British Film Institute's review of the serial when it was included in their TV 100 list in 2000, in 75th position– 20th out of the dramas featured: [...] "In a story which mined mythology and folklore... {{under the guise of}} genre it tackled serious themes of man's hostile nature and the military's perversion of science for its own ends." [...] The theme of military takeover of peaceful scientific research was also considered favourably by Patrick Stoddart, writing for The Sunday Times in 1988: [...] "Last <b>week</b> <b>I</b> watched a BBC drama in which a scientist fought against smirking government ministers and power-crazed army officers to stop his peaceful rocket research group being turned into a Star Wars vehicle to put missiles on the moon. They won." ...|$|E
500|$|Den of Geek {{viewed the}} episode positively, observing that in {{contrast}} to the previous installment, [...] "Ability" [...] "progresses the main plot arc in a substantial way... I’m now really interested to see what happens next, whereas last <b>week</b> <b>I</b> wasn’t that bothered." [...] IGN's Ramsey Isler was a little more critical and rated the episode 7.8/10. He noted that though the ending with Walter [...] "was as good as you could ask for" [...] and enjoyed David Robert Jones as a villain, the episode had a [...] "number of rough patches," [...] as the middle was [...] "paced slowly" [...] and lacking in suspense, Peter's [...] "handiness was again reduced to ...'that guy with connections'", and the audience was [...] "once again subjected to the torture that is Sanford Harris". After describing the Olivia-Peter scene near the end as [...] "tense and cleverly written," [...] Isler concluded his review by noting references to The X-Files and hoping Jones would appear again soon.|$|E
500|$|For {{the next}} two years, the band played {{throughout}} the Boston area. Eventually Godsmack's CD landed {{in the hands of}} Rocko, the night-time DJ for Boston radio station WAAF (FM). The radio station put [...] "Keep Away" [...] into heavy rotation and the song rose to the number one spot at the station very quickly. Newbury Comics, a New England record store chain, agreed to sell the CD on consignment. Shortly after the success of [...] "Keep Away", Godsmack went back into the studio and recorded a single titled [...] "Whatever", which became the new local favorite on WAAF (FM). In an interview Sully Erna stated, [...] "We had been selling maybe 50 copies a month at the time WAAF picked up the album. All of a sudden we started moving over a thousand records a <b>week.</b> (...) <b>I</b> was doing all this from my bedroom. After years of grinding away, things finally started taking off".|$|E

500|$|Gregg Allman's lyrical {{contributions}} to the band's debut album have been called [...] "remarkably mature lyrical conceptions for such a young man, expertly executed in a minimalist, almost haiku style." [...] Allman's inspiration came from his time in Los Angeles {{as a part of}} Hour Glass, [...] "getting fucked by different land sharks in the business," [...] experiencing great frustration among fierce competition. The traditional blues songs were, likewise, regarded as [...] "songs that were so good they couldn’t be left off the album." [...] On the writing of the record, Allman wrote in his memoir My Cross to Bear, [...] "I wrote most of that whole first record in that one <b>week.</b> <b>I</b> had total peace of mind. L.A. and all its changes didn’t even cross my mind. I felt like I was starting all over, which I was." [...] Most of the songs on the album were written at Rose Hill Cemetery.|$|E

Digital Spy revealed that the week-long 6000th episode celebrations would see the wedding of regular characters, Donna Freedman (Margot Robbie) and Ringo Brown (Sam Clark). It was later announced that an attempt on the life of long term regular, Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) would be the focus of the actual 6000th episode. Bower said [...] "Last <b>week</b> <b>I</b> saw episode 6,000. This marks Australian television history. The 6,000th episode falls on a Friday so the whole week is a special one. As Stefan Dennis – Paul Robinson – was in the first episode 25 years ago, it was decided that his character play a most important role in this very special event".|$|E
500|$|In 1915, the {{children}} of an unknown family living in a Devonshire rectory wrote to express their disappointment in {{the lack of a}} sequel to Mr. Tod. Potter enjoyed continuing the lives of her characters through these letters and responded:It is sad to have caused such disappointment! [...] I think I saw Tommy Brock's wife last <b>week.</b> <b>I</b> couldn't think who the person reminded me of, and when I read your letter I remembered directly!

I believe Tommy Brock is very grumpy with the grown-up ones, and makes them clear off into the woods; and, as you know, he is not often at home himself. Mrs. Badger is rather lighter coloured than he is, rather sandy, with little piggy eyes and a snouty nose, and a not particularly clean house, I should say [...] she finishes wearing out Tommy's celebrated boots. Mr. Tod has been across lately, I smelt him myself; but he had removed before the hounds came.|$|E
