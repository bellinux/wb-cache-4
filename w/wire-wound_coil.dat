40|$|This paper investigates how {{the power}} {{generated}} by electromagnetic based vibrational power generators scales with {{the dimension of}} the generator. The effects of scaling on the magnetic fields, the coil parameters and the electromagnetic damping are presented. An analysis is presented for both <b>wire-wound</b> <b>coil</b> technology and micro-fabricated coils. The power obtainable from electromagnetic generators in the dimension range of 1 – 10 mm is calculated. It is shown that the theoretical maximum power scales with the cube of the dimension. It is also shown that the high coil resistance associated with micro-coils severely restricts the power, which can be extracted...|$|E
40|$|The {{design and}} use of capacitor-driven pulsed magnets with <b>wire-wound</b> <b>coils</b> are reviewed. Magnet design is governed by two basic factors: the pulse {{duration}} which depends on {{the mass of the}} coil and the available energy; the peak field which depends on the mechanical strength of building materials and on the geometry. Options for the design of future high performance magnets are discussed. These magnets are characterized by a relatively small bore (10 - 20 mm) and limited pulse duration (typically 10 ms). It has been established that most solid state experiments can be successfully conducted under these conditions, at temperatures down into the millikelvin range. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|The {{three main}} {{categories}} of RTD sensors are thin-film, <b>wire-wound,</b> and <b>coiled</b> elements. While these types {{are the ones}} most widely used in industry, other more exotic shapes are used; for example, carbon resistors are used at ultra-low temperatures (−173 °C to −273 °C).|$|R
40|$|The {{mathematical}} {{foundation is}} laid {{for a relatively}} new type of magnets generating uniform transverse field - tilted coil magnets. These consist of concentric nested solenoidal coils with elliptical turns tilted at a certain angle to the central axis and current flowing in opposite directions in the coils tilted at opposite angles, generating a perfectly uniform transverse field. Both superconducting wire-wound and resistive Bitter tilted coils are discussed. An original analytical method is used {{to prove that the}} <b>wire-wound</b> tilted <b>coils</b> have the ideal distribution of the axial linear current density - "cosine-theta". Magnetic fields are calculated for a tilted Bitter coil magnet using an original exact solution for current density in an elliptical Bitter disk. Superconducting <b>wire-wound</b> tilted <b>coil</b> magnets may become an alternative for traditional dipole magnets for accelerators, and Bitter tilted coil magnets are attractive for rotation experiments with a large access port perpendicular to the field.

40|$|The design, {{construction}} and calibration of a purpose-built electrodynamic shaker for making {{frequency response function}} measurements on lightweight structures at high frequencies (i. e. many kHz) are described. The shaker uses a conventional <b>wire-wound</b> <b>coil</b> onto which is assembled a force gauge. The force gauge is constructed using little {{more than just a}} miniature piece of piezoelectric material. The dimensions of the components used to manufacture the shaker are determined by comparing their estimated dynamic behaviour with the estimated mobility of a lightweight perspex test structure. Although such an electrodynamic shaker is not entirely novel, it demonstrates how careful use of basic materials can produce a device that overcomes some limitations of commercial devices at very little cost...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} program are to develop and evaluate electromagnetic sensor arrays for use in NDE and robotics. The work at SRI {{has focused on the}} use of inductive sensors; parallel work at Stanford University [1] has emphasized capacitive sensors. The previously reported <b>wire-wound</b> <b>coil</b> sensor [2], consisting of a drive coil and several smaller pickup coils, uses a technology that is not well suited for constructing an array. Furthermore, the spatial resolution of such a sensor is limited by the practical size of the pickup coils. In this paper we describe the development of a sensor array that uses printed-circuit technology to overcome these limitations. We expect that printed-circuit technology will simplify the fabrication of an array, permit precise replication of the array elements, reduce the minimum achievable size of individual array elements to improve spatial resolution, and allow the construction of two-dimensional arrays...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} a MEMS intraocular coil {{which is designed}} to be flexible, biocompatible and electrically efficient as the secondary power coil of inductive coupling links for retinal prostheses applications. A microfabricated structure of parylene-gold-parylene is combined with a folding technique to create a conducting strip with increased cross-section and length than is possible without folding, which is then wound to form a single-layer coil. Compared with the <b>wire-wound</b> <b>coil</b> and MEMS planar coil, our strip-fold-and-wound origami coil can better fulfill the size, mass, and flexibility requirements of an intraocular implant, and also reduce the proximity effect and achieve high quality factor at the targeted frequency. As an example, a 5 -turn prototype coil of 10 mm outer diameter, 1 mm thickness and 10 mg weight in saline, has an inductance of 480 nH and reaches a maximum Q factor of 12. 5 at 30 MHz. A further increase of Q factor can be achieved by increasing the equivalent cross-sectional area by depositing thicker metal...|$|E
40|$|The European {{effort to}} develop {{nondestructive}} pulsed magnets for scientific research in fields up to 100 T is now well under way. Within the network of European magnet laboratories, two routes towards 100 T have emerged from an EC-sponsored design study. In this paper, the route using <b>wire-wound</b> <b>coils</b> will be described, {{this is based on}} technology available at the participating laboratories. For magnets driven by energy limited power sources (e. g. capacitor banks), coils with internal and external reinforcement will be developed, these are likely to consist of two or three concentric coils. With an energy source of order 10 MJ, the pulse duration will be of order 10 ms. For use with a power limited supply (e. g. generators), the magnet consists of typically up to ten coils that are energised separately to generate pulses with a 100 T/ 50 ms flat top using a 1 GW source. A series of test coils with gradually increasing peak field will be built and tested in order to optimize design, construction techniques and predictive computations...|$|R
40|$|Nondestructive {{inspections}} involving multi-layered structures {{often require}} a reliable NDI methodology to estimate size {{and location of}} a flaw with quantitative information about width and depth. Compared to conventional <b>wire-wound</b> pick-up <b>coil</b> based eddy current NDI methods, Giant Magneto-resistive (GMR) sensor based eddy current methods have shown a much better sensitivity (20 – 50 times) for a given driving current and frequency. In addition to the higher sensitivity of the GMR sensors, {{it has been shown}} that the interpretation of GMR sensor detected signals is much less complicated than the conventional eddy current signals that are normally displayed on an impedance plane. Unlike <b>wire-wound</b> pick up <b>coils,</b> solid-state GMR sensors detect magnetic fields directly, where the magnitudes of magnetic fields are displayed in terms of voltage. Flaw signals detected with GMR sensors (voltage and distance) are similar to flaw signals detected with ultrasonic transducers (voltage and time). In this study, experimental results for various hidden flaws in thick metals and in double-layered aircraft lap joints are presented. The results show that quantitative sizing of flaws can be done fast and reliably...|$|R
40|$|Magnetoencephalography (MEG) systems {{based on}} a dense array of high {{critical}} temperature (high-T-c) superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) can theoretically outperform a state-of-the-art MEG system. On the way towards building such a multichannel system, we evaluate feedback methods suitable for use in dense high-T-c SQUID arrays where the sensors are in very {{close proximity to the}} head (on-scalp MEG). We test on-chip superconducting coils and direct injection of the feedback current into the SQUID loop as alternatives to the <b>wire-wound</b> copper <b>coils</b> commonly used in single-channel high-T-c SQUID-based MEG systems. For the evaluation, we have performed coupling, noise, and crosstalk measurements. We conclude that direct injection is the optimal solution for dense on-scalp MEG as it gives crosstalk below 0. 5 % even between SQUIDs whose pickup loops are within 0. 8 mm of one another. Further, this solution provides sufficient flux coupling without adding additional noise. Finally, it does not compromise the standoff distance, which is important for on-scalp MEG...|$|R
40|$|A {{new class}} of {{wireless}} neural interfaces is under development {{in the form of}} tens to hundreds of mm-sized untethered implants, distributed across the target brain region(s). Unlike traditional interfaces that are tethered to a centralized control unit and suffer from micromotions that may damage the surrounding neural tissue, the new free-floating wireless implantable neural recording (FF-WINeR) probes will be stand-alone, directly communicating with an external interrogator. Towards development of the FF-WINeR, in this paper we describe the micromachining, microassembly, and hermetic packaging of 1 -mm 3 passive probes, each of which consists of a thinned micromachined silicon die with a centered Ø(diameter) 130 μm through-hole, an Ø 81 μm sharpened tungsten electrode, a 7 -turn gold <b>wire-wound</b> <b>coil</b> wrapped around the die, two 0201 surface mount capacitors on the die, and parylene-C/Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) coating. The fabricated passive probe is tested under a 3 -coil inductive link to evaluate power transfer efficiency (PTE) and power delivered to a load (PDL) for feasibility assessment. The minimum PTE/PDL at 137 MHz were 0. 76 %/ 240 μW and 0. 6 %/ 191 μW in the air and lamb head medium, respectively, with coil separation of 2. 8 cm and 9 kΩ receiver (Rx) loading. Six hermetically sealed probes went through wireless hermeticity testing, using a 2 -coil inductive link under accelerated lifetime testing condition of 85 °C, 1 atm, and 100 %RH. The mean-time-to-failure (MTTF) of the probes at 37 °C is extrapolated to be 28. 7 years, which is over their lifetime...|$|E
40|$|Rising {{from the}} “excess demand” modern {{societies}} and economies place on limited road resources, congestion causes increased vehicle emissions, decreases national efficiency, and wastes time (Downs, 2004). In order to minimise congestion’s impacts, traffic management systems gather traffic data {{and use it}} to implement efficient management algorithms (Downs, 2004). This dissertation’s purpose has been the development of a distributable vehicle presence detection sensor, which will wirelessly provide vehicle presence information in real time. To address the sensor’s wireless power requirements, the feasibility of self-powering the device via harvested energy has been investigated. Piezoelectric, electrostatic, and electromagnetic energy harvesting devices’ principles of operation and underlying theory has been investigated in detail and an overview presented alongside a literature review of previous vibration energy harvesting research. An electromagnetic energy harvesting device was designed, which consists of: a nylon reinforced rubber bladder, hydraulic piston, neodymium magnets, and <b>wire-wound</b> <b>coil</b> housing. Preliminary testing demonstrated a harvested energy between 100 mJ and 205 mJ per axle. This amount is able to be transferred to a 100 O load when driven over at speeds between 10 km/h and 50 km/h. Combined with an embedded circuit, the energy harvester facilitated the development of a passive sensor, which is able to wirelessly transmit a vehicle’s presence signal to a host computer. The vehicle detected event is displayed via a graphical user interface. Energy harvesting’s ability to power the embedded circuit’s wireless transmission, demonstrated the feasibility of developing systems capable of harvesting energy from their environment and using it to power discrete electronic components. The ability to wirelessly transmit a vehicle’s presence facilitates the development of distributable traffic monitoring systems, allowing for remote traffic monitoring and management...|$|E

The EVEH {{consists of a}} resistant (copper) spring, a permanent magnet (NdFeB 35) and a <b>wire-wound</b> copper <b>coil.</b> The copper spring was fabricated by the laser precision cutting technology. A numerical model was adopted to analyze magnetic field distribution of a rectangle permanent magnet. The finite element (FEM) soft ANSYS was used to simulate the mechanical properties of the system.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the design, fabrication {{and testing of}} electromagnetic microgenerators. Three different designs of power generators are partially microfabricated and assembled. Prototype A having a <b>wire-wound</b> copper <b>coil,</b> Prototype B, an electrodeposited copper coil both on a Deep Reactive Ion etched (DRIE) silicon, beam and paddle. Prototype C uses moving NdFeB magnets in between two microfabricated coils. The integrated coil, paddle and beam were fabricated using standard micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) processing techniques. For Prototype A, the maximum measured power output was 148 nW at 8. 08 kHz resonant frequency and 3. 9 m/s 2 acceleration. For prototype B, the microgenerator gave a maximum load power of 23 nW for an acceleration of 9. 8 m/s 2, at a resonant frequency of 9. 83 kHz. This is a substantial improvement in power generated over other microfabricated silicon based generators reported in literature. This generator has a volume of 0. 1 cm 3 which is lowest of all the silicon based microfabricated electromagnetic power generators reported. To verify the potential of integrated coils in electromagnetic generators, Prototype C was assembled. This generated a maximum load power of 5...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} {{prototype}} module of our extendible and robust multichannel SQUID magnetometer system. A multi-module arrangement {{can be implemented}} by using up to 7 modules. It is intended for high-precision measurements of biomagnetism and spin precession. Further demanding applications are magnetorelaxometry and ultra-low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (ULF NMR), where pulsed fields of up to 100 mT are typically applied. The system is operated inside the Berlin Magnetically Shielded Room and equipped with 18 magnetometers consisting of niobium (Nb) <b>wire-wound</b> pick-up <b>coils.</b> A total of 16 small pick-up coils with 17. 1 mm diameter form a regular grid with individual channels arranged to ensure system sensitivity covers all three orthogonal spatial directions. Two large hexagonal pick-up coils with an equivalent diameter of 74. 5 mm sensitive in z-direction surround the grid at two different heights and are suitable {{for the detection of}} deep sources. Each coil is connected to the input of a thin-film Nb SQUID current sensor via a detachable superconducting contact. The SQUIDs are equipped with integrated input current limiters. Feedback into the pick-up coils minimizes crosstalk between channels. The current sensor chip package includes a superconducting shield of Nb. The field distortion of the prototype and a multi-module arrangement was analysed by numerical simulation. The measured noise of the small magnetometers was between 0. 6 and 1. 5 fT/Hz$^{ 1 / 2 }$, and well below 1 fT/Hz$^{ 1 / 2 }$ for the large ones. Using a software gradiometer, we achieved a minimum noise level of 0. 54 fT/Hz$^{ 1 / 2 }$. We performed ULF NMR experiments, verifying the system's robustness against pulsed fields, and magnetoencephalographgy (MEG) on somatosensory evoked neuronal activity. The low noise performance of our 18 -channel prototype enabled the detection of high-frequency components at around 1 kHz by MEG. Comment: 11 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
40|$|In small, {{cylindrical}} gradient coils {{consisting of}} a single layer of wires, the limiting factor in achieving large magnetic field gradients is the rapid increase in coil resistance with efficiency. This behavior results from the decrease in the maximum usable wire diameter {{as the number of}} turns is increased. By adopting a multilayer design in which the coil wires are allowed to spread out into multiple layers wound at increasing radii, a more favorable scaling of resistance with efficiency is achieved, thus allowing the design of more powerful gradient coils with acceptable resistance values. By extending the theory used to design standard cylindrical gradient coils, mathematical expressions have been developed that allow the design of multilayer coils. These expressions have previously been applied to the design of a four-layer z-gradient coil. As a further development, the equations have now been modified to allow the design of multilayer transverse gradient coils. The variation in coil performance with the number of layers employed has been investigated for coils of a size suitable for use in NMR microscopy, and the effect of constructing the coil using wires or cuts in a continuous conducting surface has also been assessed. We find that at fixed resistance a small <b>wire-wound</b> two-layer <b>coil</b> offers an increase in efficiency of a factor of about 1. 5 compared with a single-layer coil. In addition, a two-layer coil of 10 -mm inner diameter has been designed and built. This coil had an efficiency of 0. 41 Tm- 1 A(- 1), a resistance of 0. 96 +/- 0. 01 Omega, and an inductance of 22. 3 +/- 0. 2 muH.
