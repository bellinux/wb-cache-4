[...] "The song just about wrote itself," [...] Greenwood said in the book God Bless the USA (by Greenwood and Gwen McLin). [...] "The words seemed to flow naturally from the music, and came out with total honesty. They were an expression of my feelings of pride. To me, America seemed just like a rookery, a place where <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> grow, unmolested and free." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{whether it}} was Marvel's idea or the showrunner's to have Coulson {{promoted}} to Director and tasked with rebuilding S.H.I.E.L.D. {{at the end of}} the season, Jed Whedon said [...] "They're one in the same. They have plans for films, and we have plans to intermingle with them, and it's the name of our show. The second to last episode is called [...] "Ragtag", and that's a term we've used; we wanted to create this ragtag group, but within this giant organization with billions of dollars and support all over the globe and satellite feeds on their luxurious plane. Now <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> start them over and figure out what it's like to really be a secret again." ...|$|E
500|$|Since 1996, when MLS {{teams were}} first {{included}} in the tournament, the home team had won nine times and lost only twice in the final match. Commenting on what his team brings to the game, Sounders FC coach Sigi Schmid stated, [...] "We bring a clean slate. We haven't had any negative experiences in championship games, {{so we want to}} just build up a positive legacy for our team and we know <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> make some history for our team. Every player knows that and that's something we want to try and do." [...] D.C. United had previously won the U.S. Open Cup twice in 1996 and 2008 and this was their fourth appearance ever in the tournament final. D.C. United president Kevin Payne simply stated, [...] "We want to win anything we enter." ...|$|E

500|$|When Arsenal {{moved to}} the Emirates Stadium, the club prioritised repaying the loans over {{strengthening}} the playing squad. Arsenal's self-sustaining model relied heavily on qualifying for the UEFA Champions League; as Wenger recalled in 2016: [...] "We had to be {{three years in the}} Champions League out of five and have an average of 54,000 people, and we didn’t know we would be capable of that." [...] The club sold several experienced players throughout the late 2000s and early 2010s and raised ticket prices, upsetting supporters who have called for change. Wenger took umbrage over criticism and revealed the bank loans were contingent on his commitment to the club: [...] "The banks wanted the technical consistency to guarantee that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> pay [...] back. I did commit and I stayed and under very difficult circumstances. So for me to come back {{and on top of that}} [...] reproach me for not having won the championship during that period it is a bit overboard." [...] Wenger later described the stadium move as the toughest period of his life because of the restricted finances in place.|$|E
500|$|Benfica began March {{competing}} {{at three}} levels: the Primeira Liga, the Portuguese Cup and the UEFA Cup. Their first game {{was at the}} Estádio José Alvalade against Sporting CP. Managed by Paulo Bento, the hosts scored the opening goal in the 11th minute with a header by Simon Vukčević. In the 40th minute, Rui Costa's corner kick allowed Cardozo to head in the tying goal. Benfica held second place, five points ahead of Sporting. For Camacho, the result was [...] "very important because we kept our advantage, allowing us to remain in second place". The following Thursday, Benfica hosted Getafe in the UEFA Cup. The match quickly soured for the club when Cardozo was sent off in the ninth minute, and Rubén de la Red scored Getafe's first goal in the 25th minute. During the second half Pablo Hernández added another, and Mantorras scored a 76th-minute consolation goal for Benfica. Camacho said, [...] "We started poorly because Getafe has a good team. With Cardozo's ejection, things got more complicated. In the second half, Benfica was better, the players fought and showed <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> eliminate them." [...] On 9 March, Benfica hosted União de Leiria. They conceded an opening goal in the 42th minute, scoring two second-half goals in five minutes: one each by Zoro and Cardozo. Serge N'Gal scored a 69th-minute equaliser for the draw. The result had repercussions, as Camacho resigned: [...] "I cannot do anything else to improve this team's performance." [...] His resignation, so late in the season, caught Benfica's management by surprise. They opted to not replace him, nominating his assistant Fernando Chalana as manager. Chalana accepted the challenge: [...] "I am here through thick and thin." [...] His first game as manager was against Getafe on the road on 12 March. Benfica had to score two and allow none to progress; Makukula hit the post in the sixth minute, and Getafe qualified with a 77th-minute goal by Juan Ángel Albín. Four days later, Benfica played Marítimo at Barreiros, with Cardozo scoring his 19th goal {{of the season in}} the 26th minute. In the second half, Ytalo scored a 75th-minute equaliser for Marítimo. Chalana said, [...] "We had a great first half. We dominated and honestly I was not expecting Marítimo's goal. I was sad with the way it appeared. We did everything to win." [...] The fourth consecutive draw cost Benfica their lead over Vitória de Guimarães for second place. Back from international break, the club hosted Paços de Ferreira on 30 March in a 4–1 win. At half-time, the score was 1–1, but Cardozo and Rui Costa's second-half goals gave Benfica their first domestic win in March.|$|E

It's bleak because I can't — many of us can't hear her sweet voice — but it's great because she did live, and she was ours.

50|$|Soft determinism, as {{the name}} suggests, is a more passive view of the way {{technology}} interacts with socio-political situations.
