Of a white population of just 65,000, only 10,000 were fit and available for active service. It was decided not to create a full Rhodesian formation: if it were wiped out, the colony's future prosperity would be put at risk. Instead mostly small groups of Rhodesians were distributed throughout the British Army, Navy and Air Force.

It has been {{suggested}} that Rædwald's queen had previously been married to a member of the Essex royal family and that Sigeberht was Rædwald's stepson, as <b>was</b> <b>stated</b> by William of Malmesbury in the 12th century. Sigeberht earned the enmity of his step-father, who drove him into exile in Gaul, possibly to protect the Wuffingas bloodline.|$|E

None of the motions were successful. Later in the same year, they abolished handling and touchdowns. It <b>was</b> <b>stated</b> that this was to bring them closer to non-handling games.|$|E
