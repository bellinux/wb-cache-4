Michael tries a number of different things to help Deangelo, such as sitting on his stomach and making him listen to a <b>Walkman</b> at full volume so he cannot hear himself think, but none are effective.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the birth}} {{and growth of}} the {{cassette}} began in the 1960s, its cultural moment {{took place during the}} 1970s and 1980s. The cassette's popularity grew during these years as a result of being a more effective, convenient and portable way of listening to music. Stereo tape decks and boom boxes became some of the most highly sought-after consumer products of both decades. Portable pocket recorders and high-fidelity ("hi-fi") players, such as Sony's <b>Walkman</b> (1979), also enabled users to take their music with them anywhere with ease. The increasing user-friendliness of the cassette led to its popularity around the globe. The body of the <b>Walkman</b> was not much larger than the cassette tape itself, with mechanical keys on one side, or electronic buttons or a display on the face. Sony's WM-10 was even smaller than the cassette itself, and expanded to hold and play a cassette.|$|E

25|$|Although modern {{headphones}} {{have been}} particularly widely sold and used for listening to stereo recordings since {{the release of the}} <b>Walkman,</b> there is subjective debate regarding the nature of their reproduction of stereo sound. Stereo recordings represent the position of horizontal depth cues (stereo separation) via volume and phase differences of the sound in question between the two channels. When the sounds from two speakers mix, they create the phase difference the brain uses to locate direction. Through most headphones, because the right and left channels do not combine in this manner, the illusion of the phantom center can be perceived as lost. Hard panned sounds will also only be heard only in one ear rather than from one side.|$|E
500|$|In a {{departure}} from previous Bond films, The Living Daylights {{was the first to}} use different songs over the opening and end credits. The song heard over the end credits, [...] "If There Was a Man", was one of two songs performed for the film by Chrissie Hynde of The Pretenders. The other song, [...] "Where Has Everybody Gone", is heard from Necros's <b>Walkman</b> in the film. The Pretenders were originally considered to perform Daylights title song. However, the producers had been pleased with the commercial success of Duran Duran's [...] "A View to a Kill", and felt that A-ha {{would be more likely to}} make an impact on the charts.|$|E
500|$|Similar {{to how the}} Zoo TV Tour {{display screens}} sampled video footage from {{television}} programming, a number of songs from Zooropa sample audio.

500|$|The {{game was}} sent to Nintendo of America for testing. The sales manager disliked it for being too {{different}} from the maze and shooter games common at the time, and Judy and Lincoln expressed reservations over the strange title. Still, Arakawa adamantly believed {{that it would be}} big. American staffers asked Yamauchi to change the name, but he refused. Arakawa and the American staff began translating the storyline for the cabinet art and naming the other characters. They chose [...] "Pauline" [...] for the Lady, after Polly James, wife of Nintendo's Redmond, Washington, warehouse manager, Don James. The name of [...] "Jumpman", a name originally chosen for its similarity to the popular brands <b>Walkman</b> and Pac-Man, was eventually changed to [...] "Mario" [...] in likeness of Mario Segale, the landlord of the original office space of Nintendo of America. These character names were printed on the American cabinet art and used in promotional materials. Donkey Kong was ready for release.|$|E
