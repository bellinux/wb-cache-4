500|$|Cobb reveals to Ariadne {{that he and}} Mal went to Limbo while {{experimenting with}} the dream-sharing technology. Sedated {{for a few hours}} of real time, they spent fifty years in a dream {{constructing}} a world from their shared memories. When Mal refused to return to reality, Cobb used a rudimentary form of inception by reactivating her totem (an object dreamers use to distinguish dreams from reality) and reminding her subconscious that their world was not real. However, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>woke</b> up, Mal still believed that she was dreaming. In an attempt to [...] "wake up" [...] for real, Mal committed suicide and framed Cobb for her death to force him to do the same. Facing a murder charge, Cobb fled the U.S., leaving his children in the care of Professor Miles.|$|E
500|$|Loh sought {{his wife}} at Lim's flat and ended up staying to observe her treatment. [...] He was persuaded by her to {{participate}} in the electro-shock therapies. [...] In the early hours of 7January 1980, Loh sat with Hoe, their arms locked together and their feet in separate tubs of water. [...] Lim applied a large voltage to Loh, who was electrocuted, while Hoe was stunned into unconsciousness. [...] <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>woke,</b> Lim requested her to lie to the police about Loh's death. [...] Hoe repeated the story Lim had given her, saying that her husband had been electrocuted in their bedroom when he tried to switch on a faulty electric fan in the dark. [...] The coroner recorded an open verdict, and the police made no further investigations.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{standing}} only [...] tall in heels, {{she often}} caught {{the gaze of}} men in the street, being attractive and full-figured. She was always well-dressed and even went to bed with make-up on so as to [...] "look beautiful <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>woke</b> up". [...] A nephew later said that she could [...] "make a joke out of nothing", and could have [...] "walked out of a burning house with a smile and a joke". She frequented Liverpool's dance halls and clubs where she was often asked to dance in jitterbug competitions with dockers, soldiers, sailors, and waiters. It was remarked that she could be as humorous as any man and would sing the popular songs of the day at any time of day or night. Her voice sounded similar to Vera Lynn's, whilst Lennon specialised in impersonating Louis Armstrong and Al Jolson. [...] She played the ukulele, the piano accordion, and the banjo (as did Lennon), although neither pursued music professionally. They spent their days together walking around Liverpool and talking of what they would do in the future: opening a shop, a pub, a cafe, or a club.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Oh, please don't!' said Violet; 'she {{will begin}} {{screaming}} again!' Then, seeing the cloud return, 'Presently, dear aunt, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>wakes.</b> Is not <b>she</b> a beauty?' ...|$|R

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from October 29, 1910. It states: [...] "Marie is the tiny daughter of a well to do farmer. On Halloween her father, to amuse her, picks a pumpkin that she selects, and fashions a jack-o-lantern out of it. Her new toy pleases the child immensely, and at once takes a place in her affections equal to that held by her dollie. So it is natural {{that she should be}} thinking about the two of them when she is tucked into bed and falls asleep. Perhaps that was why the queen of the fairies came to her and invited her to a Halloween party that her loyal subjects were giving in their woodland retreat. And so that Marie would be perfectly happy, not feel embarrassed among strangers, the queen asked Dollie and Pumpkin to be her guests also. And, as a further mark of favor, she waved her hand, and Dollie and Pumpkin could run around and talk as well as Marie could. It certainly made it more enjoyable for the little girl. A fairy Halloween party is one of the finest things going in the amusement line, and only very nice and very good little girls are invited to them. As Marie filled these requirements, she had a perfectly glorious time, but was inclined to weep <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>woke</b> up later in her own little bed, and found that her toys had lost their miraculous gift of life. But it consoled her somewhat to have them, for they served as reminders of her wonderful evening. And perhaps the fairies will ask her to attend another party later. If they do, she has decided that Pumpkin and Dollie must have their shares of the good times as before." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to this text, the Vipassī Buddha was {{the first}} of six incarnations to precede Gautama. The others listed are Sikhī, Vessabhū, Kakusandha, Koṇāgamana, and Kassapa. The most popular legendary account of the birth of Buddha is in the Nidanakatha Jataka (see, Jataka tales) which {{accounted}} for the lives of Buddha in previous incarnations. [...] In this account, the “Great Being” chose the time and place of his birth, the tribe into which he would be born, and who his mother would be. [...] In the time chosen by him, Maya, his mother, fell asleep and dreamed that four archangels carried her to the Himalayan Mountains where their queens bathed and dressed her. [...] In her dream the Great Being soon entered her womb from her side, {{in the form of a}} white elephant. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>woke,</b> she told her dream to the Raja, who summoned sixty-four eminent Brahmans to interpret it.|$|E
60|$|This {{time she}} slept about two hours, and <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>woke,</b> even my unpractised {{eye could see}} that she was decidedly better than before.|$|E
6000|$|Joe nodded. [...] "Mrs. Camels," [...] {{by which}} I {{presently}} understood he meant Camilla, [...] "she have five pound fur to buy rushlights {{to put her}} in spirits <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>wake</b> up in the night." ...|$|R
6000|$|Humiston ignored this thrust. [...] "She has beauty, imagination, and immense possibilities. She don't know herself. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>wakes</b> {{up to her}} power, {{then look}} out! She can't go on long with this old, {{worn-out}} gambler." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Cowboy, you bet we will," [...] {{returned}} Pan grimly. [...] "But we'll be far {{on our way}} <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>wakes</b> up. You {{can drive}} this wagon. We'll keep watch on her. And, well--leave it to me, Blink." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>woke</b> it {{was with}} a start; her face had grown very cold, and she felt a warm hand {{touching}} her cheek. The hand was quickly withdrawn <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>woke,</b> and looking round Fan saw someone seated by her, and although there was only the starlight from the window in the dim room, she knew that it was her mistress. She raised herself to a sitting position on the sofa, but without speaking. All her bitter, resentful feelings had suddenly rushed back to her heart.|$|E
60|$|Now {{followed}} a hot, parched, thirsty, restless night. Towards morning one terrible dream seized {{her like a}} tiger; <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>woke,</b> she felt and knew she was ill.|$|E
60|$|The {{town was}} quite quiet <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>woke</b> up at ten o'clock, and partook of coffee, very {{requisite}} and comforting after the exhaustion and grief of the morning's occurrences.|$|E
50|$|Cécile {{has just}} had a terrible car accident. Her husband François got to the {{hospital}} while she is still in a coma. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>wakes</b> up, <b>she</b> does not recognize Francois and forgot all {{the circumstances of the}} accident.|$|R

6000|$|... "Very {{possibly}} she may {{see things}} differently <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>wakes</b> to- morrow. But Sydney, {{while she is}} here, the whole subject must be avoided. It would not be acting fairly to use any influence in favour of our friends." ...|$|R
60|$|But in {{the morning}} <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>woke</b> her dream had entirely passed from her mind, and she felt just as much like a colt as when {{she had gone to}} bed.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>woke</b> up she was {{thinking}} of Alexander. It was such a long time since she had thought of him. She wondered if he had a right to be angry with her.|$|E
60|$|She cried {{herself to}} sleep, and <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>woke</b> the bag was gone. No one had seen it; {{but she told}} her mamma about the cake, and promised {{not to do so}} any more.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{is quite}} exhausted," [...] said the physician. [...] "Sleep {{is a good}} remedy. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>wakes,</b> give her a toddy--with an egg in it, if she can take it. How did she get that bruise upon her forehead?" ...|$|R
50|$|Angel hunts {{down the}} {{surviving}} demon and brings its heart {{in a glass}} mixed with other ingredients. He forces Buffy to drink it and she goes into convulsions. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>wakes</b> up, <b>she</b> is {{no longer able to}} hear thoughts.|$|R
50|$|<b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>wakes</b> {{the morning}} before the dance, she notices that she is {{virtually}} hairless, and cries while being embraced by her mother. Sarabeth thinks {{it would be a}} mistake for her boyfriend to take her to the prom in this condition.|$|R
60|$|The poor queen {{crouched}} under a {{rock for}} the rest of the night, and the next morning, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>woke</b> from her troubled dreams, she was cheered at seeing the frog watching by her.|$|E
6000|$|... 'She's {{been asleep}} all night, and was, all yesterday, {{except for a}} minute or two now and then,' replied John Browdie's choice, 'and I was very sorry <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>woke,</b> for she has been SO cross!' ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was past}} three o'clock <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>woke.</b> On going downstairs again {{she found her}} mother, Norah and Miss Garth all sitting {{together}} enjoying the shade and the coolness under the open portico {{in front of the}} house.|$|E
6000|$|After all, <b>she</b> slept; and <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>waked</b> in {{the morning}} light, she looked up fixedly at her mother and said tenderly, [...] "Ah, poor mamma! You have been sitting up with me. Don't be unhappy. I shall live. I shall be better." ...|$|R
6000|$|Kate, in terror, stood watching, waiting {{till the}} lines of struggle, of pain, {{smoothed}} out, and the girl, doubly beautiful in her resignation, lay like one adorned for the angel of death. Then Clarke said, solemnly: [...] "She has ceased to struggle. She is in good hands, {{in the care of}} those who love her and understand her; <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>wakes</b> <b>she</b> will be newly consecrated to her great work. Come." ...|$|R

6000|$|What could Amoret {{have done}} to bring down such shafts of ridicule upon her? Could she have {{resisted}} the irresistible Mr. Congreve? Could anybody? Could Sabina, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>woke</b> and heard such a bard singing under her window. See, he writes— ...|$|E
60|$|However, she {{secreted}} the sweets {{under her}} bed, and ate them all herself, {{when she went}} to bed, and <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>woke</b> in the morning. All the time she felt very guilty and ashamed, but she simply did not want to share them.|$|E
60|$|Now {{after the}} days of {{mourning}} were at an end, the wife was sleeping at her husband's side, and in her sleep she dreamed that she was once more in her father's house, and <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>woke</b> up it was no dream.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bless you, no! She's {{as near as}} {{possible}} in perfect health physically. A different woman from what she was this time last year, I can tell you. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>wakes</b> up, she'll either be herself again, without a single illusion of any sort, or--" ...|$|R

50|$|The next day, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>wakes</b> up, <b>she</b> {{sees that}} her hair {{has been cut}} and finger been removed, exactly like the dead woman in the cellar. Upon confronting the Gandhis, she realises that she {{is to be used}} as a pawn of {{extortion}} from Remon.|$|R
