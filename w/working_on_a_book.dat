25|$|After {{receiving}} the Gunzo Award for his 1979 literary work Hear the Wind Sing, Murakami did not aspire {{to meet other}} writers. Aside from Sarah Lawrence's Mary Morris, whom he briefly mentions in his memoir What I Talk About When I Talk About Running alongside Joyce Carol Oates and Toni Morrison, Murakami was never {{a part of a}} community of writers, his reason being that he was a loner and was never fond of groups, schools, and literary circles. When <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>book,</b> Murakami states that he relies on his wife, who is always his first reader. While he never acquainted himself with many writers, Murakami enjoys the works of Ryu Murakami and Banana Yoshimoto.|$|E
25|$|At eleven o'clock, on {{the morning}} of October 20, 1969, in St. Petersburg, Florida, Kerouac was sitting in his {{favorite}} chair drinking whiskey and malt liquor, <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> about his father's print shop in Lowell, Massachusetts. He suddenly felt nauseated and walked to the bathroom, where he began to vomit blood. Kerouac was taken to a nearby hospital, suffering from an abdominal hemorrhage. He received several transfusions in an attempt {{to make up for the}} loss of blood, and doctors subsequently attempted surgery, but a damaged liver prevented his blood from clotting. He died at 5:15 the following morning at St. Anthony's Hospital, never having regained consciousness after the operation. His cause of death was listed as an internal hemorrhage (bleeding esophageal varices) caused by cirrhosis, the result of longtime alcohol abuse. A possible contributing factor was an untreated hernia he suffered in a bar fight several weeks earlier. He is buried at Edson Cemetery, Lowell, Massachusetts.|$|E

25|$|After his {{personal}} tragedies while he remaining locked in his room, Blackford began <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> {{to report the}} important decisions of the Supreme Court and provide a legal source to the state lawyers and judges. He was meticulous and precise in his writing. His biographer attributed his ability to write concisely {{to the fact that}} he never practiced law extensively, and never developed the habit of writing lengthy arguments, but instead kept his thoughts clear and precise. Each volume he authored covered a decade of court decisions and were published four years after the decade was complete. So careful was Blackford in ensuring the quality and accuracy of the work, he regularly held up printing to make corrections found after a few volumes were printed, and after they were printed, if an error was reported, he would destroy the existing copies and have new ones made. He used his own savings to have the books published with the intention of selling them to lawyers in Indiana. The sale of the books brought Blackford a substantial income, and he earned between $1,500 and $2,000 annually on royalties.|$|E

He {{died at the age of}} 40 in Oakland, California when he was hit by a drunk driver while changing a flat tire on his car.

500|$|During {{the period}} in which he wrote Cryptonomicon, Stephenson read George Dyson's Darwin Amongst the Machines, which led him to Gottfried Leibniz's {{interest}} in a computing machine, the Leibniz–Newton feud, and Newton's work at the Royal Treasury. He considered this [...] "striking when [...] was already <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> about money and a book about computers," [...] and became inspired to write about the period. Originally intended to be included in Cryptonomicon, Stephenson instead used the material as the foundation for Quicksilver, the first volume of the Baroque Cycle. The research for the sprawling historical novel created what Stephenson called [...] "data management problems", and he resorted to a system of notebooks to record research, track characters, and find material during the writing process.|$|E
