Hare had eyes only for the gravelly bars and shallow levels of the creek; intent on finding the easy going for his horse he strode on and on thoughtless of time. Nor did he talk to Mescal, for the work was hard, and he needed his breath. Splashing the <b>water,</b> <b>hammering</b> the stones, Silvermane ever kept his nose at Hare's elbow. They climbed little ridges, making short cuts from point to point, they threaded miles of narrow winding creek floor, and passed under ferny cliffs and over grassy banks and through thickets of yellow willow. As they wound along the course of the creek, always up and up, the great walls imperceptibly lowered their rims. The warm sun soared to the zenith. Jumble of bowlders, stretches of white gravel, ridges of sage, blocks of granite, thickets of manzanita, long yellow slopes, crumbling crags, clumps of cedar and lines of pinon--all were passed in the persistent plodding climb. The canon grew narrower toward its source; the creek lost its volume; patches of snow gleamed in sheltered places. At last the yellow-streaked walls edged out upon a grassy hollow and the great dark pines of Coconina shadowed the snow.|$|E

For the experiments, an installation has been created that makes it possible to measure and record the <b>water</b> <b>hammering</b> that occur when the tanks are filled. Measurement of the amplitude of the <b>water</b> <b>hammering</b> was carried out by a specially developed piezoelectric sensor, and the registration – by a light-beam oscilloscope. The technique of carrying out the experiment is described and the results of an experimental study of the water hammers arising when the vessels are completely filled are presented. Quantitative data were obtained on the amplitudes of the hydraulic impacts depending on the rate of filling of the vessel and the diameter of the outlet, the maximum pressure of the hydraulic shock was 7 – 9 atm. Comparison of calculated and experimental data has been performed. The allowable discrepancy is explained by the calculated value of the system stiffness coefficient, which did not take into account the presence of welded seams in the tank that imparts the system with additional rigidity.

40|$|Complex fluids are {{expected}} to demonstrate rheological behavior intermediate between solids (completely elastic) and fluids (completely viscous). However, despite abundant existence of complex fluids their rheological behavior is still a much debated topic in literature. Time dependent thixotropy rheology has long been considered for complex fluids which does not appropriately account for the compressibility of the fluids. Furthermore, prediction of pressure propagation in gel {{for the study of}} flow restart is challenging in absence of appropriate rheological representation of gel. Hence, we propose strain/deformation dependent non-linear shear thinning, viscous hardening and viscoelasticplastic thixotropy rheologies. Deformation in the gel is a function of applied stress, compressibility and time. The proposed rheologies are used in the numerical simulation for the prediction of pressure wave propagation in gel and flow restart. In particular, the effect of the propagation of sequential inertial, viscous and gel degradation waves on the shear melting of the gel are investigated. Moreover, the effect of thermal melting of the gel and heterogeneous initial gel conditions on the pressure wave propagation and flow restart are also analyzed. Three extreme compressibility regimes are identified namely; high compressibility (X Θ ~ 10 - 6 pa - 1) where is the isothermal compressibility), low compressibility (X Θ ~ 10 - 6 pa - 1) and intermediate compressibility (XΘ ~ 10 - 6 pa - 1). Finite volume on the staggered grid as a numerical method is developed. A fully implicit solver is used for the solution of non-linear set of equations. For validation of numerical algorithm, the pressure wave speed for low viscosity Newtonian fluids is calculated, The pressure wave speed in Newtonian fluid is found to be same as acoustic speed. The rheological model is compared with experimental data. Furthermore, qualitative comparison of pressure wave propagation with literature data and with the data from the flow loop at IFE are obtained. Shear thinning thixotropy rheology, approximates initial deformation in the gel by high viscosity. Viscoelastic-plastic rheology assumes initial deformation in the gel as elastic deformation, followed by creep flow which results in the gel breakage. In viscous hardening rheology, initially viscosity increases with deformation then it decreases similar to shear thinning thixotropy gel. In addition to rheology, compressibility plays {{a significant role in the}} pressure wave propagation beyond critical length(critical length Lc = 4 p D = Ty, where p is pressure in the gel, D is diameter of pipeline and Ty is the yield stress of the gel). In high compressibility gel, breakage is found to be sequential in nature. In this case both shear thinning and viscoelastic thixotropic rheology have similar prediction. In the cases of intermediate and high compressibility gel, the high initial viscosity in shear thinning rheology results in an attenuated pressure propagation. Subsequent creep flow degrades the gel after a very long time. The thermal melting of the gel and the cohesive failure in the heterogeneous gel makes pressure wave propagation and flow restart faster. The penetration of fresh fluid in the gel is found to be similar to finger (only central gel is displaced by incoming fresh fluid). For low compressibility fluids, the deformation by compression is very small. Hence,for viscoelastic–plastic fluid, the elastic force is much lower than the static yield value that allows pressure wave to propagate beyond critical length. However, the deformation slowly increases and when the absolute value of strain approaches the critical value of strain throughout the pipelines simultaneously, then flow does not restart despite of pressure propagation. In the case of intermediate compressible fluids, deformation in the gel by compression and its subsequent shearing effects (creep) is of the order of critical strain and pressure may not propagate beyond critical length. The pressure wave propagation beyond critical length depends on applied pressure, gel strength, and gel degradation constant in addition to compressibility. Furthermore, transition velocity profile is found as parabolic due to the initial compressional flow followed by the Bingham type intermediate flow profile and finally after gel degradation, velocity profile becomes similar to poiseuille flow. A <b>water</b> <b>hammering</b> kind of effect is observed at virtual boundary (at critical length). We have also proposed a new heuristic rule to determine flow restart and pressure wave propagation beyond critical length. If XΘΔ p 2 = 8 Ty >> Υ s (where Υ s is the strain at static yield stress(maximum stress point on stress–strain curve)) then pressure wave propagates and flow starts for pipeline with length larger than critical length, if XΘp 2 / 8 Ty << Υs pressure wave propagates beyond critical length without flow start and in the case of XΘΔp 2 / 8 y s neither pressure wave propagates nor flow restarts for the pipeline larger than critical length. Finally, three different approaches are recommended for faster flow restart of the gelled pipeline longer than critical length. PhD i kjemisk prosessteknologiPhD in Chemical Engineerin...|$|E

The use {{of a piece of}} flexible plastic pipe for <b>water</b> <b>hammer</b> control is discussed and experimental data for the use of such a device are presented. The device, referred to as a plastic chamber, reduces pressures resulting from <b>water</b> <b>hammer.</b> The flexibility of the plastic chamber allows radial expansion of its walls under pressure to accommodate the excess fluid and thereby reduce water hammer-induced pressure spikes. To enhance the performance of the plastic chamber, air-filled balls are inserted into the chamber.

Previous experimental data {{on the use of the}} plastic chamber and the air-filled balls (inserted in a rigid chamber) are analyzed. The effect of the plastic chamber on the reduction of <b>water</b> <b>hammer</b> was formulated as a function of a dimensionless parameter related to the plastic chamber and the pipe for which <b>water</b> <b>hammer</b> is to be controlled.

In turn, the elastic wave velocity depends on the modulus of elasticity of the fluid and the pipe material, the size and thickness of the pipe, the method by which the pipe is constrained or tied down and the Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s ratio for the material of which the pipe os constructed. The extensive engineering analysis and design of piping systems in which <b>water</b> <b>hammer</b> occurs is relatively common in recent years. Most piping systems in previous years have been constructed of metal or concrete pipe or some other equally rigid material and experimental verification of the theories predicting <b>water</b> <b>hammer</b> wave velocity, intensity and duration has been realized. Recently, however, there has been an increase in the use of plastic material to construct pipes. There has been little coordinated work done {{on the extent to which}} the classical theory of hydraulic transients will predict <b>water</b> <b>hammer</b> in these plastic pipes. It appears that use of plastic matierals in constructing water pipe will increase dramatically in the next few years and, therefore, research into the behavior of this pipe under <b>water</b> <b>hammer</b> pressures is justified and timely. Late in 1969 the Johns-Manville Corporation undertook preliminary studies of <b>water</b> <b>hammer</b> occurring in the PVC (polyvinylchloride_ pipe which they manufacture. The results of this work cast considerable doubt as to the validity of applying the classical equations predicint <b>water</b> <b>hammer</b> to PVC pipe. As a result of this conclusion, the Johns-Manville Corporation retained the Utah Water Research Laboratory to generate conclusive results on the behavior of this type of pipe under <b>water</b> <b>hammer</b> pressures...|$|R

According to the {{situation}} of Chinese urban water supply, this article has analyszed the possibility and computing method for <b>water</b> <b>hammer</b> that caused by pump stop in large diameter and high-lift water pipelines. In addition the impact of Full-featured Pump Curve on the <b>water</b> <b>hammer</b> calculation are also discussed. Finally, using the <b>water</b> <b>hammer</b> calculation of the primary pumping stations within a water-supply project which located in northeast China as an example, we had made corresponding conclusion. Preface China is a country with many mountains, and in recent years, urban industrial water demand in China is increasing every year. The {{most common form of}} water-supply pipeline in China has charactors such as large diameter, long distance, high head and multi-twists. According to engineering experiences, in this sort of pipelines serious destructive Pump Stopping <b>Water</b> <b>Hammer</b> are frequently caused due to many reasons (suddenly the valve is turned off, suddenly the pump is stoped, etc.). Therefore, protect the large diameter, long distance and high head pipelines from pump stopping <b>water</b> <b>hammer</b> is important to ensuring the security of water supply in cities. The Numerical Method Of Full-featured Pump Curve...|$|R
