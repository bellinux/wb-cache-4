40|$|The {{emission}} optics of a Steigerwald type {{electron gun}} is re-examined. The virtual and real points of divergence, divergence angles and beam-widths {{of the electron}} beams at different telefocusing strength are measured in detail for first time. Two different <b>Wehnelt</b> <b>cylinders</b> are used to establish a contrasting viewpoint. The original `focusing' curves measured by Braucks are reconstructed and will be explained only through a `new' interpretation which {{is different from the}} conventional views. While the image of the emitting surface in front of the filament is indeed telefocused beyond the anode, the envelope of the beam does not `focus' as expected. A new model for the emission mechanism is established based on our results. Comment: 14 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
5000|$|The {{principal}} use of lanthanum hexaboride is in hot cathodes, {{either as}} a single crystal or as a coating deposited by physical vapor deposition. Hexaborides, such as lanthanum hexaboride (LaB6) and cerium hexaboride (CeB6), have low work functions, around 2.5 eV. They are also somewhat resistant to cathode poisoning. Cerium hexaboride cathodes have a lower evaporation rate at 1700 K than lanthanum hexaboride, but they become equal at temperatures above 1850 K. Cerium hexaboride cathodes have one and half the lifetime of lanthanum hexaboride, due to the former's higher resistance to carbon contamination. Hexaboride cathodes are about ten times [...] "brighter" [...] than tungsten cathodes, and have 10-15 times longer lifetime. Devices and techniques in which hexaboride cathodes are used include electron microscopes, microwave tubes, electron lithography, electron beam welding, X-ray tubes, and free electron lasers. Lanthanum hexaboride slowly evaporates from the heated cathodes and forms deposits on the <b>Wehnelt</b> <b>cylinders</b> and apertures. LaB6 is also used as a size/strain standard in X-ray powder diffraction to calibrate instrumental broadening of diffraction peaks.|$|R
50|$|A <b>Wehnelt</b> <b>cylinder</b> (also {{known as}} Wehnelt cap, grid cap or simply Wehnelt) is an {{electrode}} in the electron gun assembly of some thermionic devices, used for focusing {{and control of}} the electron beam. It is named after Arthur Rudolph Berthold Wehnelt, a German physicist, who invented it during the years 1902 and 1903. Wehnelt cylinders are found in the electron guns of cathode ray tubes and electron microscopes, and in other applications where a thin, well-focused electron beam is required.|$|E

5000|$|Much of Wehnelt's {{research}} {{dealt with}} thermionic emission, the emission of electrons in vacuum tubes. In this context, he developed in 1902/03 the <b>Wehnelt</b> <b>cylinder,</b> an electrode used in electron guns. In 1904 he developed what is arguably {{his most important}} invention, the Wehnelt or oxide cathode for vacuum tubes. [...] He found that when the cathode in a vacuum tube is coated with an alkaline earth metal oxide, such as calcium oxide or barium oxide, its work function is reduced, causing it to emit electrons more rapidly. The oxide cathode became the standard type of cathode used in vacuum tubes to the present day.|$|E
50|$|In an {{evacuated}} {{glass bulb}} some hydrogen gas (H2) is filled, {{so that the}} tube has a hydrogen atmosphere at low pressure of about 1 Pa is formed. The pressure is such that the electrons are decelerated by collisions {{as little as possible}} (change in kinetic energy), the number of collisions are few but sufficient to emit visible light. Inside the bulb there is an electron gun. This consists of a heating spiral, a cathode and an anode hole. From the cathode (-) electrons are emitted and accelerated by the electric field towards the positively charged anode (+). Through a hole in the anode, the electrons leave the beam forming system and the <b>Wehnelt</b> <b>cylinder</b> bundles.|$|E

50|$|A direct current, {{electrostatic}} thermionic {{electron gun}} is formed from several parts: a hot cathode, which is heated {{to create a}} stream of electrons via thermionic emission, electrodes generating an electric field which focus the beam (such as a <b>Wehnelt</b> <b>cylinder),</b> and one or more anode electrodes which accelerate and further focus the electrons. A large voltage between the cathode and anode accelerates the electrons. A repulsive ring placed between them focuses the electrons onto a small spot on the anode {{at the expense of}} a lower extraction field strength on the cathode surface. Often at this spot is a hole so that the electrons that pass through the anode form a collimated beam and finally reach a second anode called a collector. This arrangement is similar to an Einzel lens.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is finding a {{geometric}} configuration that allows electron insertion into a Gabor plasma lens {{in order to increase}} the density of the confined electrons and provide ignition conditions at parameters where ignition is not possible. First, simulations using CST and bender were conducted to investigate several geometric configurations in terms of their performance of inserting electrons manually. One particular design has been chosen as a basis for an experiment. In order to prepare the experiment, further simulations using the code bender have been conducted to investigate the density distribution that is formed inside the Gabor lens when inserting electrons transversally in compliance with the chosen design. Additionally, bender was used to investigate the impact of the initial electron energy on the distribution inside the lens. Simulations with and without space charge effects have shown a significant impact of the space charge effects on the resulting density dstribution. Therefore, space charge effects have proven to be the major electron redistribution process. A given electron source was characterised in order to find the performance under the conditions inside a Gabor lens. In particular, a transversal magnetic field that will be present in the experiment has to be compensated by shielding the inner regions of the source by a μ-metal layer. Using a μ-metal shield, transversal magnetic fields are sufficiently tolerable to perform measurements in a Gabor lens. Additionally, operating close to 100 eV electron energy yields a maximum in the emitted current. Adding a <b>Wehnelt</b> <b>cylinder</b> to the electron source furthermore improves the extracted current to roughly 1 mA. A test stand consisting of a newly designed anode for the Gabor lens, as well as a terminal for the electron source, was constructed. The electron source was thoroughly characterised in the environment of the Gabor lens and the ignition properties of the new system were evaluated. In further experiments, electron beam assisted ignition by increasing the residual gas pressure was observed and the impact of the position of the electron source on the ignition properties was investigated. In addition, ignition of a sub-critical state, that is a state consisting of potential, magnetic field and pressure that did not yet perform ignition by itself, was performed by increasing the extracted current from the electron source. Finally, the electron source was used to influence a pre-ignited plasma. The density was measured, which was increased by the use of the electron source in most cases.
