A crest, the metalophid, reaches from the protoconid nearly to the metaconid. A small cusp, the mesostylid, is {{connected}} to the metaconid in front of it, unlike in Miopetaurista and Aliveria. There are two broad roots. The next tooth, m2, is similar to m1 in most respects, but the <b>width</b> at the front is virtually equal to the <b>width</b> at the back, so that the tooth is about rectangular. The back of m3 is rounded, but the tooth is still nearly rectangular. There is a long anteroconid, with is mainly connected to the metaconid. There is no metalophid. This tooth has three roots: two at the front and a larger one at the back.|$|E

Some of these curves have been used as the shapes of coins. The Reuleaux triangle can also be generalized into three dimensions in multiple ways: the Reuleaux tetrahedron (the intersection of four balls whose centers lie on a regular tetrahedron) does not have constant <b>width,</b> but can be modified by rounding its edges to form the Meissner tetrahedron, which does.

5|$|The {{national}} flag has {{a length of}} 2.20meters and a <b>width</b> of 1.47m, a ratio of 2 to 3. The field is split into three horizontal colored bands, a yellow band of one-half the flag's <b>width,</b> a blue band of one-quarter the <b>width,</b> and a red band of one-quarter the <b>width.</b> All three bands extend {{the full length of}} the flag. The flag is charged with the Ecuadorian coat of arms scaled to one-half the <b>width</b> of the flag and centered in the field. The coat of arms itself is constructed in a rectangle with proportions 12:10. The national standard has the same design as the {{national flag}}, but is square, with length 0.9m and <b>width</b> 0.9m. When used by military units and organizations, lettering can encircle the coat of arms with a diameter of 55 centimeters. The lettering must be 4cm in height, 3cm in <b>width,</b> gold-colored Roman font, embroidered with gold thread. The only other regulated size is a table flag (banderola) where the flag is 200mm wide and 300mm long. When manufacturing the national flag, sellers to the public must include the name of their company, along with the year of manufacture, by placing a 20 × 10mm tag on the reverse side of the flag on the sleeve.|$|E

Cellulose microfibril <b>widths</b> in the holocellulose samples were further determined from transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images of individualized fibrils prepared by 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethylpiperidine- 1 -oxy radical-mediated oxidation of the holocelluloses and the successive disintegration of the oxidized products in water. The TEM images also supported the finding that cellulose microfibril <b>widths</b> of transgenic poplars were larger than those of the wild type. The cellulose microfibril <b>widths</b> of transgenic poplars were approximately 6 nm, whereas those of the wild type were about 5 nm. However, such enlargement of cellulose microfibril <b>widths</b> could not be explained by the increased cellulose contents of the transgenic poplars alone.|$|R
5|$|The Reuleaux {{triangle}} is {{the least}} symmetric curve of constant <b>width</b> according to two different measures of central asymmetry, the Kovner–Besicovitch measure (ratio of area to the largest centrally symmetric shape enclosed by the curve) and the Estermann measure (ratio of area to the smallest centrally symmetric shape enclosing the curve). For the Reuleaux triangle, the two centrally symmetric shapes that determine the measures of asymmetry are both hexagonal, although the inner one has curved sides. The Reuleaux triangle has diameters that split its area more unevenly than any other curve of constant <b>width.</b> That is, the maximum ratio of areas {{on either side of}} a diameter, another measure of asymmetry, is bigger for the Reuleaux triangle than for other curves of constant <b>width.</b>|$|E
5|$|The angles made by {{each pair}} of arcs {{at the corners of}} a Reuleaux {{triangle}} are all equal to 120°.

The largest equilateral triangle inscribed in a Reuleaux triangle is the one connecting its three corners, and the smallest one is the one connecting the three midpoints of its sides. The subset of the Reuleaux triangle consisting of points belonging to three or more diameters is the interior of the larger of these two triangles; it has a larger area than the set of three-diameter points of any other curve of constant <b>width.</b>|$|E
