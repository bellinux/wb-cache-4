40|$|Although the <b>wetting</b> <b>films</b> {{are similar}} in many aspects to other thin liquid films, there are some {{differences}} in their behavior, too. In contrast to soap and emulsion films, whose surfaces are homogeneous, solid substrates of <b>wetting</b> <b>films</b> are heterogeneous as a rule, unless special measures for their homogenization are taken. Here we mean primarily heterogeneous distribution of surface energy leading to existence of hydrophobic domains on hydrophilic surfaces and vice versa. As is known, such hydrophobic domains could {{play the role of}} gas-phase nucleation centers and it is widely accepted nowadays that nano-bubbles can be formed there. The present paper reviews the effect of nano-bubbles adhered at solid surface on stability of <b>wetting</b> <b>films.</b> It is shown that the existence of nano-bubbles is crucial for the lifetime of <b>wetting</b> <b>films.</b> Another peculiarity typical for hydrophobic solid surface, the so-called slippage effect, is also investigated and its contribution to the dispersion equation of capillary waves on <b>wetting</b> <b>films</b> is accounted for...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{study the}} {{influence}} of <b>wetting</b> <b>films</b> on (density-density) correlations for a fluid in a slit-like geometry near capillary condensation. We show that, for systems with short-ranged forces, {{the interaction between the}} <b>wetting</b> <b>films</b> strongly enhances the amplitude of the exponential decay of correlations and, unlike the interfacial roughness, is independent of a high-momentum cut-off. The correlation function shows scaling behaviour near condensation arising from the equality of two characteristic length scales: the parallel correlation length (associated with the complete <b>wetting</b> <b>films)</b> and a length scale related to the non-local interaction between the <b>wetting</b> <b>films</b> {{on either side of the}} slit. We introduce an dimensionless amplitude ratio associated with the decay of correlations which allows us to distinguish between local and non-local effective Hamiltonian theories. Only the latter is fully consistent with microscopic density functional descriptions of correlation functions.

Volume solid is the term which indicates {{the proportion of the}} solid contacting the paint on a volume basis. For example, if paint is applied in a <b>wet</b> <b>film</b> at a 100 µm thickness, and the volume solid of paint is 50%, then the dry film thickness will be 50 µm as 50% of the wet paint has evaporated. Suppose the volume solid is 100%, and the <b>wet</b> <b>film</b> thickness is also 100 µm. Then after complete drying of the paint, the DFT will be 100 µm because no solvent will be evaporated.|$|E

However, the local process at the origin of the energy dissipation is not entirely elucidated yet, and several models may apply, thus making worth local studies on simpler systems.

40|$|International audienceThe heating of coexisting gas {{and liquid}} phases of pure fluid through its {{critical}} point makes the fluid extremely compressible, expandable, slows the diffusive transport, and decreases {{the contact angle}} to zero (perfect wetting by the liquid phase). We have performed experiments on near-critical fluids in a variable volume cell in the weightlessness of an orbiting space vehicle, to suppress buoyancy-driven flows and gravitational constraints on the liquid-gas interface. The high compressibility, high thermal expansion, and low thermal diffusivity lead to a pronounced adiabatic heating called the piston effect. We have directly visualized the near-critical fluid's boundary layer response to a volume quench when the external temperature is held constant. We have found that when the system's temperature T is increased at a constant rate past the critical temperature T(c), {{the interior of the}} fluid gains a higher temperature than the hot wall (overheating). This extends previous results in temperature quenching experiments in a similarly prepared system when the gas is clearly isolated from the wall. Large elliptical <b>wetting</b> <b>film</b> distortions are also seen during these ramps. By ray tracing through the elliptically shaped <b>wetting</b> <b>film,</b> we find very thick <b>wetting</b> <b>film</b> on the walls. This <b>wetting</b> <b>film</b> is at least one order of magnitude thicker than films that form in the Earth's gravity. The thick <b>wetting</b> <b>film</b> isolates the gas bubble from the wall allowing gas overheating to occur due to the difference in the piston effect response between gas and liquid. Remarkably, this overheating continues and actually increases when the fluid is ramped into the single-phase supercritical phase...|$|R

40|$|Effects of pH and {{additives}} (NaCl, Na 2 SO 4, NaSCN and urea) on the adsorption of an ABA {{triblock copolymer}} (F 127) with polyethylene oxide as the A blocks and polypropylene oxide as the B blocks, at the interfaces of <b>wetting</b> <b>films,</b> on film drainage {{and on the}} interaction forces in these films are examined using ellipsometry and a thin film balance technique. The influen-ce of these additives on micellization are studied by static light scattering. The main findings are that all additives reduce the adsorption at the silica surface and retard the film drainage. Moreover, high pH values (≈ 10) destabilize the <b>wetting</b> <b>film</b> if 0. 1 mol dm– 3 NaCl is present. The reduction of the adsorbed amount appears to be correlated with a dramatic slow down of film drainage.

40|$|Using the mean-field diffuse-interface {{model for}} liquid-vapor system and {{employing}} the numerical string method, we study the critical nuclei {{involved in the}} prewetting transitions on curved substrates. We first introduce three distinct kinds of critical nuclei, namely, the disklike, bandlike, and layerlike ones, which respectively correspond to three possible growth modes of <b>wetting</b> <b>films.</b> We show the disklike growth mode {{to be the only}} mode for infinite planar substrates. We then turn to cylindrical and spherical substrates, the two simplest but most important geometries in the real world. We focus on the critical nuclei of finite size, through which the <b>wetting</b> <b>films</b> may be formed with finite thermodynamic probabilities. It is shown that the disklike growth mode is always the most probable for <b>wetting</b> <b>film</b> nucleation and growth as long as a disklike critical nucleus exists. It is also shown that on a cylindrical substrate, the disklike critical nucleus can no longer exist if the substrate radius is smaller than some critical value, comparable to the radius of the disklike critical nucleus on planar substrate. We find that on a cylindrical substrate whose radius is below the critical value, the nucleation and growth of a <b>wetting</b> <b>film</b> can only occur through the bandlike critical nucleus. It is worth emphasizing that the results concerning the bandlike and layerlike growth modes can only be obtained from the diffuse-interface model, beyond the macroscopic description based on the line and surface tensions.
