5|$|Springfield's Most <b>Wanted</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> TV special {{hosted by}} John Walsh, host of America's Most Wanted. The special aired on September 17, 1995, before Part Two of Who Shot Mr. Burns?. A parody of Walsh's {{television}} series, this special {{was designed to}} help people find out who shot Mr. Burns, by laying out the potential clues and identifying the possible suspects. It features opinions from former Los Angeles police chief Daryl Gates and predictions from Dennis Franz, Courtney Thorne-Smith, Kevin Nealon, Chris Elliott, and Andrew Shue. It was directed by Bill Brown and written by Jack Parmeter and Bob Bain.|$|E
25|$|The EA Falcon, {{released}} {{under the}} codename EA26 (E {{for the large}} size, A for Australia, 26 for the (usually in sequence) global project number), would retain the traditional Falcon hallmarks of width and rear-wheel drive. This {{proved to be the}} correct move as sales of the Falcon began to climb after the fuel crisis aftermath, while those of the rival Commodore slipped. It became clear that Australian buying patterns had not truly changed and what the public <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> full-size (albeit smaller) family car.|$|E
25|$|Raymond's son, David Belle, {{was born}} in 1973. He experimented with {{gymnastics}} and athletics but became increasingly disaffected with both school and the sports clubs. As he got older, he started to read the newspaper clippings that told of his father's exploits and was increasingly curious about what had enabled his father to accomplish these feats. Through conversations with his father, he realised that what he really <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> means to develop skills that {{would be useful to}} him in life, rather than just training to kick a ball or perform moves in a padded, indoor environment.|$|E

500|$|After she {{was awarded}} the Nobel Peace Prize, there was praise, but also some disapproval of the {{decision}} to award it to her. A Norwegian jurist, Fredrik Heffermehl, commented on being awarded the Nobel Prize: [...] "This is not for fine people who have done nice things and are glad to receive it. All of that is irrelevant.

500|$|Despite {{the tension}} between the two men during the production, when Price saw the movie the {{following}} year, he admitted that he finally understood what Reeves had been after and wrote the young director a ten-page letter praising the film. Reeves wrote Price back, [...] "I knew you would think so." [...] Years after Reeves's death, Price said, [...] "...I realized what he <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> low-key, very laid-back, menacing performance. He did get it, but I was fighting him almost every step of the way. Had I known what he wanted, I would have cooperated." ...|$|E
500|$|Loosely {{based on}} the comic book miniseries {{of the same name}} by Mark Millar, it saw a June 2008 release worldwide. It {{received}} favourable reviews from the press, who generally liked that it was fast-paced. At the box office, <b>Wanted</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> success, grossing $341million against a $75million production budget. Next was The Last Station (2009), a biopic that details the final months of celebrated writer Leo Tolstoy and also stars Anne-Marie Duff, McAvoy's wife at the time. It was shown at a limited number of screens in the US. Although most critics' awards paid attention to co-stars Helen Mirren and Christopher Plummer, the Satellite Awards nominated McAvoy for Best Supporting Actor. In 2009, McAvoy voiced Angelina's father, Maurice Mouseling, in the television series, [...]|$|E

500|$|Complex {{named it}} the second best {{song of the}} first half of 2014. Writer Justin Charity commented saying, [...] "While hardly their strongest verses of even the past couple years, Ross, Kanye, and Sean all come correct with the quotables here, from Sean's opening mantra to Kanye's {{aggressive}} confessional to post-sex grilled cheese. The song's weary gospel build-up makes way for the minimal, rarefied ecstasy of that spaceship hangover melody. An arena confession I need to be shouting at the livest of live shows by year's end: [...] "All I <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> hundred million dollars and a bad bitch!" [...] Verdict: We need another Yeezus." [...] MySpace also named the song one of the 50 best songs of the same time period. A writer for them said, [...] "'Sanctified' is a behemoth of a track, replete with an original vocal line from Bettye LaVette that plays like a gospel sample and an impeccable verse from 'Ye that makes up for Ross rapping, [...] "Fellatio's amazin', make grilled cheese for you, the best." [...] It's simply the best gospel song masquerading as a rap jam this year." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 2014, {{executive}} producer Jeffrey Bell explained how the season would interact with Agent Carter saying, [...] "Agent Carter {{seems to be}} about SSR pre-S.H.I.E.L.D., but about the beginnings of something, and the basic values of that. S.H.I.E.L.D. got blown up last year and what Coulson always <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> return to basics, and it gives {{us an opportunity to}} return to some of those core values and even physically, some of that SSR stuff has a way of finding its way into our show that could be cool. Anyway we can tie things together, we’re {{going to try to do}} it, but it is hard when the stories are 60 years apart." [...] Ultimately, the opening scene of [...] "Shadows" [...] serves as an introduction to the world of Agent Carter with the inclusion of Atwell as Carter, setting up characters and ideas for that series, including the then unconfirmed involvement of Howard Stark, who is mentioned in the scene, as well as Carter's belief in the need for [...] "a permanent unit during peacetime", which will lead to the creation of S.H.I.E.L.D.|$|E
500|$|Delrina's initial product {{offering}} was an electronic forms application called PerForm. Amato and Skapinker {{came up with}} the idea for the product while working as consultants that what their clients <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> way to fill in forms electronically, rather than an easier way to create paper-based forms from a computer. There was significant and long-term uptake of electronic forms products within governmental agencies both in Canada and the United States, the latter spurred on in particular by the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act to reduce the total amount of paperwork handled by the United States government. One of the firm's early major software deals included a multi-year agreement to sell PerForm to the U.S. Navy in 1990. Soon after the software was installed on Compaq laptops that accompanied U.S. troops during the First Gulf War, where it was used to requisition [...] "everything from Coca-Cola to privies". Other significant volume sales went to 3M and Rockwell International. What helped set apart Delrina's electronic forms from its competitors in product reviews included its easy-to-use interface, its extensive development tools, and its comparatively low price. It also scored highly when it came to workflow and routing functions as well as security features. In early 1991 InfoWorld selected PerForm Pro ...|$|E

500|$|Talking on how {{the season}} would {{interact}} with Agent Carter, Bell said, [...] "Here's what I think is interesting. Agent Carter seems to be about S.S.R. pre-S.H.I.E.L.D., but about the beginnings of something, and the basic values of that. S.H.I.E.L.D. got blown up last year and what Coulson always <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> return to basics, and it gives {{us an opportunity to}} return to some of those core values and even physically, some of that S.S.R. stuff has a way of finding its way into our show that could be cool.

[...] Several scenes in [...] "Shadows" [...] and [...] "The Things We Bury" [...] are flashbacks featuring Peggy Carter which serve as an introduction to the world of Agent Carter, setting up characters and ideas for that series, including Carter's belief in the need for [...] "a permanent unit during peacetime", which will lead to the creation of S.H.I.E.L.D. The episode [...] "Making Friends and Influencing People" [...] names Hydra's ability to brainwash people as the Faustus Method, named for the character who appears, as Johann Fennhoff, in Agent Carter, played by Ralph Brown.|$|E
500|$|Of Smith's {{performance}} as Joey, O'Donovan opined that: [...] "For most drama series {{the presence of}} a key new character would have a tangible impact. But not Jonathan Creek, where characterisation has never been done in anything but the broadest brush strokes. Both Caroline Quentin and Julia Sawalha have previously filled the generic role of Creek's pushy, inquisitive partner pretty much interchangeably. Smith was no different. Ten minutes in and we'd forgotten she was anyone new." [...] In contrast, Mark Wright, reviewing the episode for The Stage, praised Smith's {{performance as}} Joey, deeming her to be [...] "a much more satisfying sidekick" [...] than Julia Sawalha's Carla Borrego. He enjoyed the on-screen relationship between the two lead actors, writing that: [...] "it’s the interplay between Davies and Smith that makes this really special." [...] Scotland on Sundays Chitra Ramaswamy discussed the nostalgia invoked by the series' return, alongside The Royle Family, Blackadder and Shooting Stars—other major shows which returned for 2008 Christmas specials. Ramaswamy wrote: [...] "all the comforting, well kent faces are back to soothe us through these dismal times. In a culture that {{is becoming more and more}} risk-averse, it's the oldies but goodies that we trust." [...] Sian Brewis for the Leicester Mercury also considered this nostalgia angle, but concluded that: [...] "Jonathan Creek is the sort of auld acquaintance you’re happy to see once a year – any more than that, you feel, and his mannerisms would start to grate." [...] She deemed the episode: [...] "Less a blast from the past as a shuffling [...] "excuse me". Conversely, Anne Pickles for the News and Star wrote that a one-off special was not enough, and [...] "what we really <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> brand new series". Pickles said of the episode: [...] "It’s the gentle, facially expressive, deeply sceptical, somehow slightly daft performance of Davies as Creek that makes this sleuthing drama such a glory. But a one-off? Oh come on... you can do better than that." ...|$|E

In the November general election, he faced Democrat Les Mann, a security guard at General Electric's aircraft engine plant in Evendale who previously had run for Congress against Rob Portman, and Natural Law candidate Jim Donaldson. The vote was 35,245 for Brinkman (66.7%), 2,029 for Donaldson (3.8%), and 15,531 for Mann (29.4%).|$|E

2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 2013, the Black Creek Business Association {{partnered with}} a UW-Madison student to conduct a {{community}} needs assessment. A survey of residents showed that what most <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> sense of community, with an atmosphere {{of a small town}} and an emphasis on [...] "ma and pa" [...] shops. Residents expressed an interest in an increase in food choices, the addition of flower planters and trees, making village streets more biker friendly, more parking areas, and slowing traffic on Main Street. Additionally, a desire from residents to restore and preserve historic buildings is also present throughout the study. It was suggested that the community utilize an empty lot adjacent to the state trail for a new community center that would host indoor and outdoor events. In addition to this, a new Veterans park, extended trail systems, and the addition of decorative lighting would be added to the downtown area. Together, with a UW-Extension consultant, the board devised an eight-step plan for recruiting new businesses.|$|E
2500|$|Four demos for {{the album}} were {{recorded}} on August 13, 1990; [...] "Enter Sandman", [...] "The Unforgiven", [...] "Nothing Else Matters" [...] and [...] "Wherever I May Roam."

In October 1990, Metallica began recording at One on One Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California, to record the album, and also at Little Mountain Sound Studios in Vancouver, British Columbia for about a week. On June 2, 1991, a demo of [...] "Holier Than Thou" [...] was recorded. Hetfield stated about the recording: [...] "What we really <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> live feel.

2500|$|Seamus McGarvey {{served as}} the film's cinematographer, {{shooting}} the film digitally using Arri Alexa cameras with Panavision C-Series anamorphic lenses. Sequences of the film set in the year 1954 were shot using vintage lenses from the early 1960s {{in order to give}} the film a [...] "distant period feel." [...] This effect was enhanced though the digital intermediate's colour grading, as McGarvey noted that the [...] "look I <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> peeled look with muted colors and diffusion on the highlights, a sense of period distance. I found a lot of photographs and magazines, and I knew that I wanted the blacks to be imbued with a tint of magenta." [...] Though the film was made to be released in 3D, it received a predominantly 2D release. McGarvey himself decided to shoot the film as if it were only 2D, because he dislikes working with 3D filming equipment and the experience of watching 3D films in theatres.|$|E

2500|$|On April 9, 2008, hotel chef Christian Kalaw {{alleged that}} he was accosted by Mendoza and several other {{officers}} over a parking violation. [...] Kalaw alleged that the police planted sachets of methamphetamine in his car, forced {{him to take the}} drug, and accused him of being a drug addict. The officers also allegedly demanded Kalaw access his bank ATM and hand over money. Kalaw said the policemen released him after a friend raised 20,000 pesos on his behalf. The Office of the Ombudsman found Mendoza and four others guilty of misconduct, and ordered Mendoza's dismissal from the service and the voiding of all his benefits. In late April 2008, he was relieved as Chief of the Mobile Patrol Unit. In August 2008, the Eighth Division of the Manila Prosecutors' Office vacated the case after Kalaw failed to attend the dismissal proceedings, and in October the PNP Internal Affairs Service recommended the case be dropped. Mendoza's brother, Gregorio, later stated that all his brother <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> fair hearing by the Ombudsman, who [...] "never even gave him a chance to defend himself; they [...] immediately dismissed him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Casting {{was a long}} process, notably {{with the}} {{characters}} of Neal Caffrey and Peter Burke. Jeff Artel had stated that what the producers <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> [...] "young Warren Beatty." [...] After seeing over 300 potential actors, and at the recommendation of casting director Gayle Pillsbury, the casting of Matt Bomer as Neal Caffrey was announced on August 11, 2008, which lifted the contingency off the pilot order. Eastin had previously seen Bomer as Bryce Larkin on NBC's Chuck, which contributed to his casting. On August 21, 2008, after a long process that included a reading with Matt Bomer, USA Network announced the casting of Tim DeKay as Peter Burke and the official greenlighting of the pilot. They also announced that the project would be directed by Bronwen Hughes. By October 31, 2008, Willie Garson had joined the cast as Mozzie. The fourth addition to the cast was Tiffani Thiessen as Elizabeth Burke (who {{at the time was}} intended to be an accountant), on November 11, 2008. Jackie de Crinis, an executive at USA Network, stated, [...] "She brings a beauty and warmth to this role that really makes the character come alive." [...] White Collar final star was announced on December 8, 2008 to be Marsha Thomason. Thomason would play a junior agent named Diana Lancing; this name was later changed to Diana Berrigan.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1865 Ali Ben Ghedhahem and {{his brother}} Abd En Nebi were taken under watch to Constantine while his men were {{disarmed}} and interned by the French. The French treated them well, as they saw him as a potential ally {{in the event of}} a future conquest of the country. On 5 February Sadok Bey granted a fresh amnesty to the rebels who had fled, but not to the Ben Ghedhahem brothers. At the same time, the Bey made secret contact with them, claiming that the French were making preparations to betray them and deliver them both to him at the Bardo. Finally, missing his homeland, Ali Ben Ghedhahem took flight on 17 November 1865 and returned to Tunisia, hiding out in the Regba massif near the border at Ghardimaou. The Bey's armies under General Slim laid siege to him but the mountain people refused to give him up. [...] Some tribal leaders tried to persuade him to resume armed resistance in order to end the reprisals and extortions the army was inflicting on their region, but he refused. All he <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> pardon from the Bey so he could return to normal life. Eventually, he was persuaded to place himself under the protection of an Algerian marabout of the Tijaniyya order, Mohammed el Aïd, who was on his way to Mecca by way of Tunis. [...] On 25 February 1866, Ben Ghedhahem joined his caravan at El Ksour. The caïd of El Kef wanted to arrest him, but his soldiers refused to do so. [...] On 28 February, having reached Téboursouk, he was captured by cavalry sent out by the Bey. His brother managed to escape.|$|E
