40|$|In {{a general}} {{equilibrium}} model, this paper examines how {{the rise of}} aquaculture {{and the decline of}} <b>wild</b> fish <b>stocks</b> are related. Two factors, population growth and technological improvement in aquaculture, have been studied in an aquaculture restricted entry case and an aquaculture free entry case. Both factors raise aquaculture production, while changes in <b>wild</b> fish <b>stocks</b> hinge on entry conditions. In the restricted entry case, population growth reduces <b>wild</b> fish <b>stocks,</b> but technological progress in aquaculture raises them. In contrast, in the free entry case, only technological advance in aquaculture affects and raises <b>wild</b> fish <b>stocks.</b> ...|$|R
25|$|There is genetic {{diversity}} of this crop {{in the provinces}} of China; however further research is required. There is genetic similarity between Aralia cordata and Aralia hispida, as in prehistoric times there was a close connection between Eastern Asia and North America, facilitating the migration of plant species. The northern variation is less matured, with smaller stem hairs, fewer nodes, side shoots, and leaves than the southern variation, potentially caused by earlier flourishing. In domestic stocks there is not as much variation, although they {{are similar to the}} <b>wild</b> <b>stocks</b> of the south, which have shorter dormancy periods.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of their}} {{prolific}} and predatory nature, {{laws have been}} enacted in some places to help {{stop the spread of}} northern pike outside of their native range. For instance, in California, anglers are required by law to remove the head from a pike once it has been caught. In Alaska, pike are native north and west of the Alaska Range, but have been illegally introduced to south-central Alaska by game fishermen. In south-central Alaska, no limit is imposed in most areas. Pike are seen as a threat to native <b>wild</b> <b>stocks</b> of salmon by some fishery managers.|$|E
25|$|Salmon {{population}} {{levels are}} {{of concern in}} the Atlantic and {{in some parts of}} the Pacific. Alaska fishery stocks are still abundant, and catches have been on the rise in recent decades, after the state initiated limitations in 1972. Some of the most important Alaskan salmon sustainable wild fisheries are located near the Kenai River, Copper River, and in Bristol Bay. Fish farming of Pacific salmon is outlawed in the United States Exclusive Economic Zone, however, there is a substantial network of publicly funded hatcheries, and the State of Alaska's fisheries management system is viewed as a leader in the management of wild fish stocks. In Canada, returning Skeena River wild salmon support commercial, subsistence and recreational fisheries, as well as the area's diverse wildlife on the coast and around communities hundreds of miles inland in the watershed. The status of wild salmon in Washington is mixed. Of 435 <b>wild</b> <b>stocks</b> of salmon and steelhead, only 187 of them were classified as healthy; 113 had an unknown status, one was extinct, 12 were in critical condition and 122 were experiencing depressed populations.|$|E

40|$|This {{study has}} {{explored}} whether restocked fish {{of a species}} perform {{as well as its}} <b>wild</b> <b>stock,</b> and has estimated their contribution to the fishery and egg production. Approximately 220, 000 juvenile Acanthopagrus butcheri, whose otoliths were stained purple with alizarin complexone, were released into the Blackwood River Estuary in 2002 / 03. The purple stain in their otoliths was still clearly visible in 2014. Data on the biological characteristics and annual contributions to the small commercial fishery of restocked and <b>wild</b> <b>stock</b> A. butcheri were analysed. The growth of restocked fish was only slightly less than that of the <b>wild</b> <b>stock</b> and the differences between their maturity schedules were relatively small. As increasing numbers of restocked A. butcheri attained the MLL of 250 mm for retention by the commercial fisher, their contribution to the fishery increased progressively from 6 % in 2005 to 74 % in 2010. That contribution subsequently declined to 39 % in 2012 and to 10 % in 2014, due predominantly to the introduction of the very strong 2008 year class in the commercial catches, the first substantial recruitment of <b>wild</b> <b>stock</b> fish into the population since 1999. Restocked fish were estimated as contributing ~ 55 % to the eggs produced in 2008, suggesting that substantial numbers of the 2008 year class were derived from spawning by restocked fish. The results of this and a previous genetic study imply that restocking is an effective and appropriate way for replenishing stocks of an estuarine species such as A. butcheri...|$|R

500|$|After the {{completion}} of Lewiston Dam in 1963, the Bureau of Reclamation constructed the Trinity River Fish Hatchery to raise young steelhead, coho and chinook salmon.

The hatchery is operated by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife to produce returns of 7,500 coho, 6,000 spring chinook, 70,000 fall chinook and 22,000 steelhead each year. In 2014, the California Fish Hatchery Review Project found that Trinity Hatchery raised coho were out-competing <b>wild</b> <b>stocks.</b> The hatchery has since been required to carefully time releases of young fish {{in order to reduce the}} risk of competition.|$|E

N. serotinus is found along the entire Mediterranean coast. N. tazetta occurs as far east as Iran and Kashmir. Since {{this is one of the}} oldest species found in cultivation, it is likely to have been introduced into Kashmir. N. poeticus and N. pseudonarcissus have the largest distribution ranges. N. poeticus ranges from the Pyrenees along the Romanian Carpathians to the Black Sea and along the Dalmatian coast to Greece. N. pseudonarcissus ranges from the Iberian Peninsula, via the Vosges Mountains to northern France and Belgium, and the United Kingdom where there are still <b>wild</b> <b>stocks</b> in Southern Scotland. The only occurrence in Luxembourg is located near Lellingen, in the municipality of Kiischpelt. In Germany it is found mainly in the nature reserve at Perlenbach-Fuhrtsbachtal and the Eifel National Park, where in the spring at Monschau the meadows are teeming with yellow blooms. One of the most easterly occurrences can be found at Misselberg near Nassau on the Lahn.|$|E

2500|$|Tectus niloticus is {{a highly}} sought after {{resource}} in the Pacific and Indo-Pacific regions. This {{has resulted in the}} species being over-harvested. By 2007 the Solomon Islands, Fiji and Papua New Guinea have the most depleted stocks, with four surveyed sites in the Solomon Islands in 2006 averaging a density of only 11 trochus ha^-1.

2500|$|Another form {{of salmon}} production, which is safer but less controllable, {{is to raise}} salmon in {{hatcheries}} until they {{are old enough to}} become independent. They are then released into rivers, often in an attempt to increase the salmon population. This practice was very common in countries like Sweden before the Norwegians developed salmon farming, but is seldom done by private companies, as anyone may catch the salmon when they return to spawn, limiting a company's chances of benefiting financially from their investment. Because of this, the method has mainly been used by various public authorities and non profit groups like the Cook Inlet Aquaculture Association as a way of artificially increasing salmon populations in situations where they have declined due to overharvest, construction of dams, and habitat destruction or disruption. Unfortunately, there can be negative consequences to this sort of population manipulation, including genetic [...] "dilution" [...] of the <b>wild</b> <b>stocks,</b> and many jurisdictions are now beginning to discourage supplemental fish planting in favour of harvest controls and habitat improvement and protection. A variant method of fish stocking, called ocean ranching, is under development in Alaska. There, the young salmon are released into the ocean far from any wild salmon streams. When it is time for them to spawn, they return to where they were released where fishermen can then catch them.|$|E

60|$|The {{belief that}} the chief {{domestic}} races are descended from several <b>wild</b> <b>stocks</b> no doubt has arisen from the apparent improbability of such great modifications of structure having been effected since man first domesticated the rock-pigeon.

The biological characteristics of the 2001 and 2002 year classes of Acanthopagrus butcheri, which had been cultured and introduced into the Blackwood River in south-western Australia at seven and four months old, respectively, were thus determined from samples collected regularly between 2002 and 2014. The restocked fish could always be distinguished from the <b>wild</b> <b>stock</b> because their otoliths retained the pink colouration of the alizarin complexone with which they had been stained prior to release. Detailed analyses demonstrated the growth and maturity schedules of restocked fish were only slightly inferior to those of the <b>wild</b> <b>stock</b> and the mean gonad weights of the females of these two groups did not differ significantly in any month. As increasing numbers of restocked A. butcheri attained the MLL of 250 mm for retention, their contribution to the commercial fishery increased from 6 % in 2005 to 74 % in 2010.
