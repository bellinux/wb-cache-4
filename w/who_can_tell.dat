5|$|Six {{months after}} the events of , protagonist George Stobbart and his girlfriend, Nicole Collard, visit an {{archaeologist}} named Professor Oubier to learn about a mysterious Mayan stone Nico uncovered while researching a newspaper story. At Oubier's home, they are ambushed by two Central Americans, who kidnap Nico, tie George to a chair and set the building ablaze. George unties himself and puts out the fire. He contacts Andre Lobineau, who reveals that Nico had suspected that something would go wrong and had left the stone with him. Lobineau tells him of a gallery owner <b>who</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> him more about Mayan art. George discovers that Oubier supplies the gallery with Mayan artifacts, which he imports through a company named Condor Transglobal. Following this lead, George finds the two Central Americans who kidnapped Nico. One of them, whose name is later revealed to be Pablo, is shown threatening and berating the other (later revealed to be called Titipoco). George knocks Pablo unconscious and discovers that Condor Transglobal has links with Quaramonte City in Central America. He also frees Titipoco, who had been manacled by Pablo. George finds Nico, who reveals that, while trying to expose a drug ring run {{by a man named}} Karzac, she was sent the stone instead, prompting her to arrange the appointment with Oubier.|$|E

[...] Columbia Records considered bringing in an outside producer for the album and had early talks with RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan. However, Hill was adamant about writing, arranging, and producing the album herself: [...] "It would have been more difficult to articulate to other people.

[...] The Cure then embarked on their worldwide Top Tour with Thompson, Anderson and producer-turned-bassist Phil Thornalley on board. Released in late 1984, the Cure's first live album, Concert consisted of performances from this tour. Near the tour's end, Anderson was fired for destroying a hotel room {{and was replaced by}} Boris Williams. Thornalley also left because of the stress of touring. However, the bassist slot was not vacant long, for a Cure roadie named Gary Biddles had brokered a reunion between Smith and former bassist Simon Gallup, who had been playing in the band Fools Dance. Soon after reconciling, Smith asked Gallup to rejoin the band. Smith was ecstatic about Gallup's return and declared to Melody Maker, [...] "It's a group again." ...|$|E

She has confessed that she first tried the drug {{at the age of}} 14, in a nightclub. After winning her role in EastEnders at the age of 16, Westbrook was a regular on the London club scene, and her cocaine usage escalated. She has commented [...] "I was always in clubs and everyone was doing coke and it was glamorous – except obviously, it wasn't at all. I was just very young, very stupid and very easily led...I think there should be someone at EastEnders to say to young people when they come in, 'Look, your life is about to change, you're going to be invited to things, and you'll be offered drugs.' Someone <b>who</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> them what sort of people are about, and what sort of papers, and how quickly what you've worked for all those years can be gone." [...] It is estimated that she has spent over £250,000 on drugs, used 5g of cocaine every single day throughout her first pregnancy, and has admitted that during her lowest ebb she attempted suicide several times.|$|E

I thought he had suddenly foundered, and, speaking to him, was on point of dismounting and leading him, when he all of a sudden fell a-groaning pieteously, hung his head, spread out his forelegs, as if to save himself from falling, and stood stock still, continuing to groan. I thought my horse was about to die, and would have sprung from his back had a minute more elapsed; but as that instant all the shrubs and trees began to move from their very roots, the ground rose and fell in successive furrows, like the ruffled water of a lake, and I became bewildered in my ideas, as I too plainly discovered, that all this awful commotion was the result of an earthquake.

He enjoyed the sequences that highlighted individual songs but noted the documentary [...] "doesn't {{have much in}} the way of full songs". Steven Zeitchik of the Los Angeles Times called From the Sky Down a [...] "procedural look" [...] at the album's inception. Although he enjoyed Bono's humorous insights, Zeitchik said that [...] "much of the movie is abstract, insider stuff about how he and others find inspiration". John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter pointed out the limited scope of the film, calling it [...] "neither a comprehensive portrait nor one of those tossed-off featurettes that would be at home only as the filler for a commemorative Achtung Baby boxed set". Commenting on Guggenheim's filmmaking style, DeFore judged that some of his attempts to make the film more [...] "movie-ish" [...] failed to enhance the subject material.

Steven Hyden of The A.V. Club gave the film a C+, calling it [...] "occasionally enlightening but mostly frustrating". The review lamented the lack of coverage of most of the album's songs, and in Hyden's opinion, it was ironic that the band was trying to live down the [...] "ego-inflating" [...] Rattle and Hum in a film that he also considered [...] "ego-inflating".|$|E

Two darkies, walking down Broadway, saw a quarter of a dollar on the sidewalk. One of the colored gentlemen said to his companion, 'Sambo, don't you freeze to dat quarter. I seed it first.'

2500|$|The 1920s {{contained}} {{analysis of}} the poem that emphasised the poem's power. In Road to Xanadu (1927), a book length study of The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and [...] "Kubla Khan", John Livingston Lowes claimed that the poems were [...] "two {{of the most remarkable}} poems in English". When turning to the background of the works, he argued, [...] "Coleridge as Coleridge, be it said at once, is a secondary moment to our purpose; it is the significant process, not the man, which constitutes our theme. But the amazing modus operandi of his genius, in the fresh light which I hope I have to offer, becomes the very abstract and brief chronicle of the procedure of the creative faculty itself." [...] After breaking down the various aspects of the poem, Lowes stated, [...] "with a picture of unimpaired and thrilling vividness, the fragment ends. And with it ends, for all save Coleridge, the dream. 'The earth hath bubbles as the water has, and this is of them.' For 'Kubla Khan' is as near enchantment, I suppose, as we are like to come in this dull world. And over it is cast the glamour, enhanced beyond all reckoning in the dream, of the remote in time and space – that visionary presence of a vague and gorgeous and mysterious Past which brooded, as Coleridge read, above the inscrutable Nile, and domed pavilions in Cashmere, and the vanished stateliness of Xanadu." [...] He continued by describing the power of the poem: [...] "For none of the things which we have seen – dome, river, chasm, fountain, caves of ice, or floating hair – nor any combination of them holds the secret key to that sense of an incommunicable witchery which pervades the poem. That is something more impalpable by far, into which entered <b>who</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> what tracelesss, shadowy recollections ... The poem is steeped in the wonder of all Coleridge's enchanted voyagings." [...] Lowes then concluded about the two works: [...] "Not even in the magical four and fifty lines of 'Kubla Khan' is sheer visualizing energy so intensely exercised as in 'The Ancient Mariner.' But every crystal-clear picture there, {{is an integral part of}} a preconceived and consciously elaborated whole ... In 'Kubla Khan' the linked and interweaving images irresponsibly and gloriously stream, like the pulsing, fluctuating banners of the North. And their pageant is as aimless as it is magnificent ... There is, then ... one glory of 'Kubla Khan' and another glory of 'The Ancient Mariner,' as one star differeth from another star in glory." [...] George Watson, in 1966, claimed that Lowes's {{analysis of the}} poems [...] "will stand as a permanent monument to historical criticism." [...] Also in 1966, Kenneth Burke, declared, [...] "Count me among those who would view this poem both as a marvel, and as 'in principle' finished" ...|$|E
