40|$|Following a TPI techno-economic {{feasibility}} study of <b>wood</b> <b>wool</b> <b>slab</b> manufacture in Fiji a request was received {{for the following}} tests to be undertaken {{as a source of}} data for local assessments of wood wool/cement slab structural properties: (a) Compressive strength of full-sized slab; (b) Deflection under uniform loading to failure; (c) Failing load of the dowel/wood wool slab joint; (d) Shear strength of full sized slab. These tests, with the exception of shear, were undertaken by TPI in consultation with the Overseas Division of the Building Research Establishment. Shear testing was undertaken by private consultants under BRE(OD) funding. Methods used and results obtained, together with additional tests including the assessment of fire propagation and wetting expansion and drying shrinkage, are given in this report. Also included as Appendix I is a technical assessment of the minimum chemical and other raw material inputs required to produce wood wool/cement slabs to meet British Standards from P. caribaea. Comments were obtained from BRE(OD) and are given in Appendix III...|$|E

40|$|Heat and {{moisture}} transfer in <b>wood</b> <b>wool</b> <b>slabs</b> (shredded <b>wood</b> with Portland cement binder) {{has been investigated}} both experimentally and theoretically. The {{purpose of this study}} is the analysis of the process of moisture redistribution taking place inside <b>wood</b> <b>wool</b> <b>slabs</b> conditioned to moisture equilibrium (e. g., in a climatic chamber) and then mounted in a guarded hot plate or heat flux meter apparatus to measure the specimen thermal resistance. A theoretical analysis of the heat and mass transfer process for such a material was performed and then a suitable numerical model was used to predict and analyse the moisture redistribution. The porous media may be modelled as a multiphase system constituted by a solid matrix and a network of interconnected pores, partly filled with liquid water and partly with moist air. Three equations have been derived: conservation of the mass of the dry air, the conservation of the mass of water species (liquid and vapour) and the energy balance. These equations have been supplemented with the thermodynamic relations and the constitutive equations needed for the closure of the model. The experimental work was performed on a slab cut into several slices. During the experimental tests, the temperature and heat flow rate data was collected both during the steady state conditions to get the thermal resistance and during the initial transient period, when the heat flow rate is continuously varying. At the end of the test, the slices were weighed to get information on the moisture redistribution. The moisture data versus heat flow rate and temperature on the two faces of the specimen, and information about the final moisture distribution were compared with those obtained by numerical simulation. Substantial agreement between numerical result and experimental data was found...|$|R

The values of the compressive stress of the layered-structure dual-density stone <b>wool</b> <b>slabs</b> depend on the density, and the values of the compressive stress of the whole product depend more on the density of the layer having the lower-density and its compressive stress...|$|R
