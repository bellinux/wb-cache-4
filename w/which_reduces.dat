5|$|The {{region has}} {{numerous}} faults, many considered active, but none has produced significant earthquakes in recorded history. These faults tend {{to move at}} a smooth rate in what is termed fault creep, <b>which</b> <b>reduces</b> the risk of an earthquake.|$|E
5|$|All welding of {{titanium}} {{must be done}} in an {{inert atmosphere}} of argon or helium to shield it from contamination with atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen). Contamination causes a variety of conditions, such as embrittlement, <b>which</b> <b>reduces</b> {{the integrity of the}} assembly welds and leads to joint failure.|$|E
5|$|Another initiative, {{presented}} by the late Mayor Thomas Menino, is the Renew Boston Whole Building Incentive, <b>which</b> <b>reduces</b> {{the cost of living}} in buildings that are deemed energy efficient. This, much like the green housing developments, gives people of low socioeconomic status an opportunity to find housing in communities that support the environment. The ultimate goal of this initiative is to enlist 500 Bostonians to participate in a free, in-home energy assessment.|$|E

5|$|Inbreeding {{depression}} {{occurs in}} the great tit (Parus major) when the offspring produced {{as a result of}} a mating between close relatives show reduced fitness. In natural populations of Parus major, inbreeding is avoided by dispersal of individuals from their birthplace, <b>which</b> <b>reduces</b> the chance of mating with a close relative.|$|E

5|$|Like {{the other}} members of its genus, the red-throated loon is well adapted to its aquatic environment: its dense bones help it to submerge, its legs—in their {{set-back}} position—provide excellent propulsion, and its body is long and streamlined. Even its sharply pointed bill may help its underwater streamlining. Its feet are large, its front three toes are fully webbed, and its tarsus is flattened, <b>which</b> <b>reduces</b> drag and allows the leg to move easily through the water.|$|E
5|$|No {{ski poles}} are used, and no {{assistance}} from others (such as being pushed from the gate) is allowed. In heavy snow conditions the tracks can become clogged up, <b>which</b> <b>reduces</b> inrun speed and may cause an unpredictable descent for athletes. Event personnel {{standing by the}} sides of the inrun are often assigned to use leaf blowers to prevent the tracks from clogging up with snow.|$|E
5|$|This {{does not}} mean that a Category5 {{hurricane}} cannot form outside of an El Niño event. The entire year of 1959 was neither an El Niño or a La Niña, but it had one Category5 hurricane (Patsy). Most of 1973 was during a La Niña, <b>which</b> <b>reduces</b> tropical cyclone activity in the eastern Pacific, yet Hurricane Ava, a Category 5 hurricane, formed in June of that year.|$|E

5|$|Variable-speed drives {{can also}} run a motor in {{specialized}} patterns to further minimize mechanical and electrical stress. For example, an S-curve pattern {{can be applied}} to a conveyor application for smoother deceleration and acceleration control, <b>which</b> <b>reduces</b> the backlash that can occur when a conveyor is accelerating or decelerating.|$|E
5|$|A surface {{marker buoy}} (SMB) with a reel and line {{is often used}} by a dive leader to allow the boat to monitor {{progress}} of the dive group. This can provide the operator with a positive control of depth, by remaining slightly negative and using the buoyancy of the float to support this slight over-weighting. This allows the line to be kept under slight tension <b>which</b> <b>reduces</b> the risk of entanglement. The reel or spool used to store and roll up the line usually has slightly negative buoyancy, so that if released it will hang down and not float away.|$|E
5|$|Although {{juvenile}} {{and adult}} J.lagostoma are almost exclusively terrestrial, the larvae are marine and planktonic. In order to release their offspring, the adults therefore have to {{migrate to the}} sea, as seen in other land crabs, such as the Christmas Island red crab, Gecarcoidea natalis. In {{most members of the}} family Gecarcinidae, migration coincides with the rainy season, <b>which</b> <b>reduces</b> the risk of desiccation; migration in J.lagostoma occurs from January until March, while the period of highest rainfall is from March to May.|$|E

5|$|Benzodiazepines are {{effective}} as medication given {{a couple of}} hours before surgery to relieve anxiety. They also produce amnesia, which can be useful, as patients may not remember unpleasantness from the procedure. They are also used in patients with dental phobia as well as some ophthalmic procedures like refractive surgery; although such use is controversial and only recommended for those who are very anxious. Midazolam is the most commonly prescribed for this use because of its strong sedative actions and fast recovery time, as well as its water solubility, <b>which</b> <b>reduces</b> pain upon injection. Diazepam and lorazepam are sometimes used. Lorazepam has particularly marked amnesic properties that may make it more effective when amnesia is the desired effect.|$|E
5|$|Blackouts in {{freediving}} {{can occur}} when the breath is held long enough for metabolic activity to reduce the oxygen partial pressure sufficiently to cause loss of consciousness. This is accelerated by exertion, which uses oxygen faster, or by hyperventilation, <b>which</b> <b>reduces</b> the carbon dioxide level in the blood. Lower carbon dioxide levels increase the oxygen-haemoglobin affinity, reducing availability of oxygen to brain tissue {{towards the end of}} the dive (Bohr effect); they also suppress the urge to breathe, making it easier to hold the breath to the point of blackout. This can happen at any depth.|$|E
5|$|Cavities are {{in great}} demand for nesting by other cavity nesters, so {{woodpeckers}} face {{competition for the}} nesting sites they excavate {{from the moment the}} hole becomes usable. This may come from other species of woodpecker, or other cavity nesting birds like swallows and starlings. Woodpeckers may aggressively harass potential competitors, and also use other strategies to reduce the chance of being usurped from their nesting site; for example the red-crowned woodpecker digs its nest in the underside of a small branch, <b>which</b> <b>reduces</b> the chance that a larger species will take it over and expand it.|$|E

5|$|Common {{starlings}} {{will take}} over Eurasian nuthatch nest holes, reducing their breeding success. This {{is most likely to}} occur if the nest is high in a tree and there is a good local breeding density of the nuthatch. Introduced ring-necked parakeets may also compete with Eurasian nuthatches for nesting holes. The parakeets tend to occur in fragmented urban woodlands, while nuthatches prefer large old oak woodlands, <b>which</b> <b>reduces</b> the level of competition. Ornithologists conducting a 2010 Belgian study suggested that the problem was not so severe as to warrant culling of the parakeets.|$|E
5|$|Due to its graphic content, {{there are}} several {{different}} versions of Cannibal Holocaust in circulation which are edited to varying degrees. In the UK, the film was originally released on VHS by Go Video in 1982 with approximately six minutes of cuts. These cuts were self-imposed by the distributor, possibly due to technical limitations of the tape. In 2001, the film was passed for release on DVD by the BBFC with 5 minutes and 44 seconds of cuts to remove scenes of animal cruelty and sexual violence; all but 15 seconds of these cuts were waived for a re-release in 2011. The latter release also includes a new edit sponsored by Deodato <b>which</b> <b>reduces</b> the violence toward animals.|$|E

The Jury aims to order the problems so that the order in increasing difficulty is Q1, Q4, Q2, Q5, Q3 and Q6. As the leaders know the problems in advance of the contestants, they are kept strictly separated and observed.|$|E
