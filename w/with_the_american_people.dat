We {{would like to give}} special thanks to all those Americans who built the spacecraft; who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their hearts and all their abilities into those craft. To those people tonight, we give a special thank you, and to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight, God bless you. Good night from Apollo 11.|$|E

The two reaffirm their love to each other and go to Chicago. There, Lois helps Superman arrest a violent father who has been attacking his wife and son. Later, Lois and Superman investigate a factory in Des Moines. Lois wants to publish an article, which would reveal the workers' illegal activities, but Superman forces her not to. Feeling betrayed, Lois returns to Metropolis and does not speak to Superman for a while. When Lois is kidnapped by Lisa Jennings, a woman who wants to destroy Superman, he rescues her.

[...] Many Republican leaders had gone on vacation for the summer, believing that the fight, on their terms, would take place in the fall. [...] Bryan's endorsement, soon after Chicago, by the Populists, his statement that he would undertake a nationwide tour on an unprecedented scale, and word from local activists of the strong silver sentiment in areas Republicans had to win to take the election, jarred McKinley's party from its complacency.|$|E
40|$|The Republican Party’s {{most recent}} Congressional budget envisions $ 6. 5 {{trillion}} in spending cuts {{over the next}} decade, but leaves the country’s annual defense budget of nearly $ 600 billion relatively untouched. Why does Congress continue to allocate such {{large sums of money}} towards America’s defense, especially in a time of increasing deficits? Rebecca U. Thorpe writes that since World War II, government investment in the military has primed the economic pump for regions in the US which now predominantly vote for the Republican Party. This, in combination <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people’s</b> relative insulation from the effects of war, and their perceptions about external threats, makes it difficult for Congress to downsize defense budgets...|$|R

500|$|The new china, White House renovations, {{expensive}} clothing, and her {{attendance at}} the wedding of Charles and Diana, Prince and Princess of Wales, gave her an aura of being [...] "out of touch" [...] <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> during the recession. This built upon the reputation she had coming to Washington, wherein many people concluded that Reagan was a vain and shallow woman, and her taste for splendor inspired the derogatory nickname [...] "Queen Nancy". While Jacqueline Kennedy had also faced some press criticism for her spending habits, Reagan's treatment was much more consistent and negative. In an attempt to deflect the criticism, she self-deprecatingly donned a baglady costume at the 1982 Gridiron Dinner and sang [...] "Second-Hand Clothes", mimicking the song [...] "Second-Hand Rose".

500|$|Conservatives and isolationists {{had little}} {{enthusiasm for the}} Willkie campaign, and the moderates wanted to see {{stronger}} positions on progressive issues and foreign policy. Publisher Henry Luce decried both Roosevelt and Willkie for failing to be honest <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people,</b> [...] "America will never be ready for any war until she makes her mind up {{there is going to}} be a war." [...] (italics in original) Despite his pledge not to campaign, Roosevelt made inspection tours to military installations, well covered by the press. The president did not mention Willkie by name, seeking to avoid giving him publicity. [...] According to Susan Dunn in her book in the 1940 campaign, this forced Willkie [...] "to box against a phantom opponent and carry on a one-sided partisan debate... Even in Willkie's speeches, Roosevelt occupied center stage". Willkie promised to keep New Deal social welfare programs intact, expand Social Security, and provide full employment, a job for everyone: [...] "I pledge a new world".|$|E
500|$|MacArthur {{had one of}} {{the most}} {{powerful}} PR machines of any Allied general during the war, which made him into an extremely popular war hero <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people.</b> In late 1943–early 1944, there was a serious effort by the conservative faction in the Republican Party centered in the Midwest to have MacArthur seek the Republican nomination, as they regarded the two men most likely to win the Republican nomination to be the candidate for the presidency in the 1944 election, namely Wendell Willkie and Governor Thomas E. Dewey of New York, as too liberal. For a time, MacArthur, who had long seen himself as a potential president was in the words of the U.S historian Gerhard Weinberg [...] "very interested" [...] in running as the Republican candidate in 1944. However, MacArthur's vow to [...] "return" [...] to the Philippines had not been fulfilled in early 1944 and he decided not to run for president until he had liberated the Philippines.|$|E

500|$|On 28 July 1932, a {{clash between}} the District police and demonstrators {{resulted}} in two men being shot. President Herbert Hoover ordered MacArthur to [...] "surround the affected area and clear it without delay." [...] MacArthur brought up troops and tanks and, {{against the advice of}} Major Dwight D.

The troops advanced with bayonets and sabers drawn under a shower of bricks and rocks, but no shots were fired. In less than four hours, they cleared the Bonus Army's campground using tear gas. The gas canisters started a number of fires, causing the only death during the riots. While not as violent as other anti-riot operations, it was nevertheless a public relations disaster. However, the defeat of the [...] "Bonus Army" [...] while unpopular <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> at large, did make MacArthur into the hero of the more right-wing elements in the Republican Party who believed that the general had saved America from a communist revolution in 1932.|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Pardon, as Olive observed, was {{a little}} out of this combination; but he was not a person to allow himself to droop. He came and seated himself by Miss Chancellor and {{broached}} a literary subject; he asked her if she were following any of the current [...] "serials" [...] in the magazines. On her telling him that she never followed anything of that sort, he undertook a defence of the serial system, which she presently reminded him that she had not attacked. He was not discouraged by this retort, but glided gracefully off to the question of Mount Desert; conversation on some subject or other being evidently a necessity of his nature. He talked very quickly and softly, with words, and even sentences, imperfectly formed; there was a certain amiable flatness in his tone, and he abounded in exclamations--"Goodness gracious!" [...] and [...] "Mercy on us!"--not much in use among the sex whose profanity is apt to be coarse. He had small, fair features, remarkably neat, and pretty eyes, and a moustache that he caressed, and an air of juvenility much at variance with his grizzled locks, and the free familiar reference in which he was apt to indulge to his career as a journalist. His friends knew that in spite of his delicacy and his prattle he was what they called a live man; his appearance was perfectly reconcilable with a large degree of literary enterprise. It should be explained {{that for the most part}} they attached to this idea the same meaning as Selah Tarrant--a state of intimacy with the newspapers, the cultivation of the great arts of publicity. For this ingenuous son of his age all distinction between the person and the artist had ceased to exist; the writer was personal, the person food for newsboys, and everything and every one were every one's business. All things, with him, referred themselves to print, and print meant simply infinite reporting, a promptitude of announcement, abusive when necessary, or even when not, about his fellow-citizens. He poured contumely on their private life, on their personal appearance, with the best conscience in the world. His faith, again, was the faith of Selah Tarrant--that being in the newspapers is a condition of bliss, and that it would be fastidious to question the terms of the privilege. He was an enfant de la balle, as the French say; he had begun his career, at the age of fourteen, by going the rounds of the hotels, to cull flowers from the big, greasy registers which lie on the marble counters; and he might flatter himself that he had contributed in his measure, and on behalf of a vigilant public opinion, the pride of a democratic State, to the great end of preventing the American citizen from attempting clandestine journeys. Since then he had ascended other steps of the same ladder; he was the most brilliant young interviewer on the Boston press. He was particularly successful in drawing out the ladies; he had condensed into shorthand many of the most celebrated women of his time--some of these daughters of fame were very voluminous--and he was supposed to have a remarkably insinuating way of waiting upon prime donne and actresses the morning after their arrival, or sometimes the very evening, while their luggage was being brought up. He was only twenty-eight years old, and, with his hoary head, was a thoroughly modern young man; he had no idea of not taking advantage of all the modern conveniences. He regarded the mission of mankind upon earth as a perpetual evolution of telegrams; everything to him was very much the same, he had no sense of proportion or quality; but the newest thing was what came nearest exciting in his mind the sentiment of respect. He was an object of extreme admiration to Selah Tarrant, who believed that he had mastered all the secrets of success, and who, when Mrs. Tarrant remarked (as she had done more than once) that it looked as if Mr. Pardon was really coming after Verena, declared that if he was, he was one of the few young men he should want to see in that connexion, one of the few he should be willing to allow to handle her. It was Tarrant's conviction that if Matthias Pardon should seek Verena in marriage, it would be with a view to producing her in public; and the advantage for the girl of having a husband who was at the same time reporter, interviewer, manager, agent, who had the command of the principal [...] "dailies," [...] would write her up and work her, as it were, scientifically--the attraction of all this was too obvious to be insisted on. Matthias had a mean opinion of Tarrant, thought him quite second-rate, a votary of played-out causes. It was his impression that he himself was in love with Verena, but his passion was not a jealous one, and included a remarkable disposition to share the object of his affection <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people.</b>|$|E

40|$|The Article {{foresees}} {{that certain}} state legislation limiting {{access to the}} morning-after-pill will thrust the question of when life begins onto the courts. This is due both to fact that the morning-after-pill {{has the potential to}} act at a point when the existence of potential life is in dispute and largely a matter of belief and {{to the fact that the}} constitutionality of the legislation may depend on whether courts consider the morning-after-pill abortion or contraception. The Article argues that courts should address the question of whether to consider the morning-after-pill abortion or contraception by attempting to adopt and apply a constitutional definition of potential life that is consistent <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people’s</b> beliefs regarding when pregnancy or potential life begins and how personal beliefs about this subject should impact reproductive rights. Finally, the Article argues that in light of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people’s</b> beliefs regarding <b>the</b> effect their personal moral beliefs should have on personal freedoms, judges should adopt a presumption of invalidity for any definition that would impair individual rights. This presumption, however, should be rebuttable on a finding that a supermajority of the public believes that the existence of potential life at a particular point enjoys such widespread acceptance that it should affect the legal rights of even those who do not so believe. Part I establishes the possibility that State application of abortion restrictions to the morning-after-pill will result in the need for a court to decide whether the morning-after-pill is contraception or abortion. Part II first argues that State governments do not have the authority to impose their views regarding when life begins on the people in their States. Second, Part II argues for the propriety of judicial review as a mechanism for deciding whether to lump <b>the</b> morning-after-pill in <b>with</b> abortion or with contraception for constitutional purposes. Specifically, Part II argues that courts should adopt the rebuttable presumption described briefly above in order to honor the will of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> themselves...|$|R
