5|$|This {{record is}} {{a version of}} our now deleted and illegal LP '1987, <b>What</b> <b>The</b> <b>Fuck</b> <b>Is</b> Going On?' {{with all of the}} {{copyright}} infringing 'samples' edited out. As this leaves less than 25 minutes of music we are able to sell it as a 12-inch 45. If you follow the instructions below you will, after some practice, be able to simulate the sound of our original record. To do this you will need 3 wired-up record decks, a pile of selected discs, one t.v. set and a video machine loaded with a cassette of edited highlights of last weeks 'Top of the Pops'. Deck one is to play this record on, the other two are to scratch in the missing parts using the selected records. For added authentic effect you could use a Roland 808 drum machine (well cheap and what we used in the original recordings) to play along behind your scratching.|$|E

These samples provided a deliberately provocative backdrop for beatbox rhythms and cryptic, political raps. The album was released to mixed reviews, but was a commercial success.|$|E
500|$|Ritualistic burnings {{had already}} been a {{recurring}} aspect of Drummond and Cauty's work. In 1987, the duo disposed of copies of their copyright-breaching debut albumThe Justified Ancients of Mu Mu's 1987 (<b>What</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fuck</b> <b>Is</b> Going On?)by burning them in a Swedish field. This event was pictured on the back sleeve of their second album, Who Killed The JAMs?, and celebrated in the song [...] "Burn the Bastards".

500|$|The JAMs re-edited {{the single}} {{in such a}} way that—they hoped—"brought [...] inside the [...] "law" [...] but still got up peoples noses", {{removing}} all but a snatch of The Beatles, replacing or doctoring the MC5 sample, and rerecording the Samantha Fox vocal. [...] This new version—named [...] "All You Need Is Love (106bpm)"—was released on 18 May 1987 as JAMS 23T, and was included on The JAMs debut album 1987 (<b>What</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fuck</b> <b>Is</b> Going On?).

Here were Red Clydeside beatbox rappers pointing a finger at society, putting their record together from samples pirated directly from other people's recordings, {{while at the same}} time crossing almost all contemporary music tribal boundaries by including everyone from Samantha Fox to The MC5 among their victims." [...] This was contrasted with 1987 which the reviewer felt was a [...] "disappointment" [...] with [...] "too few ideas being spread too thin".|$|E
500|$|King for a Day... Fool for a Lifetime was {{recorded}} in Bearsville Studios, in Woodstock, New York. Gould has described the remote location of the studio {{as a form of}} [...] "sensory deprivation". Writing and rehearsing the songs for the album took eight to nine months, although half of this time was also spent finding a replacement for Martin. Recording the album took an additional three months, for which the band hired producer Andy Wallace. Wallace—unconnected to their previous producer Matt Wallace—had previously worked with Sonic Youth, Nirvana and Slayer. Bottum claimed the combination of Wallace and Spruance as two new influences helped to create [...] "a real up-in-the-air, <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> <b>is</b> gonna happen kind of feel" [...] while recording.|$|E
5000|$|The song is {{also noted}} for {{bringing}} house music into mainstream popular music, {{as well as}} for reviving disco music after a decade of its commercial death. Erick Henderson of Slant Magazine explained that the song [...] "was instrumental in allowing disco revivalism to emerge, allowing the denigrated gay genre to soar once again within the context of house music, the genre disco became in its second life." [...] Sal Cinquemani of the same publication wrote that the song was [...] "making its impact all the more impressive (it would go on to inspire a glut of pop-house copycats) and begging the question: If disco died a decade earlier, <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> <b>was</b> this big, gay, fuscia drag-queen boa of a dance song sitting on top of the charts for a month for?" ...|$|R

500|$|Eminem, born Marshall Bruce Mathers III, began rapping at age fourteen. In 1996, {{his debut}} album Infinite, which was {{recorded}} at the Bassmint, {{a recording studio}} owned by the Bass Brothers, was released under their independent record label Web Entertainment. [...] Infinite achieved very little commercial success and was largely ignored by Detroit radio stations. [...] The disappointment from this experience greatly influenced his lyrical style: [...] "After that record, every rhyme I wrote got angrier and angrier.

All that type of shit started pissing me off." [...] After the release of Infinite, Eminem's personal struggles and abuse of drugs and alcohol culminated in an unsuccessful suicide attempt.|$|R
500|$|Unknown to Bakshi, Krantz and {{producer}} Al Guest {{were in the}} middle of a lawsuit. Failing to reach a settlement with Guest, Krantz told Bakshi to grab the series' model sheets and return to the United States. When the studio found out, a warrant for Bakshi's arrest was issued by the Toronto police. He narrowly avoided capture before being stopped by an American border guard who asked him what he was doing. Bakshi responded, [...] "All of these guys are heading into Canada to dodge the draft and I'm running back into the States. <b>What</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> <b>is</b> wrong with that!?" [...] The guard laughed, and let Bakshi through. Vita was detained at the airport; he was searched and interrogated for six hours.|$|E
500|$|Moore wrote lyrics for {{the album}} by [...] "mumbling {{along to the}} song and then {{deciphering}} what I'm saying." [...] The lyrics feature political themes ("Hello, Helicopter!" [...] is about the US supplying military arsenals to other countries to protect its own national interests), although Matheos stated that the album was not political in nature. Moore said that he writes lyrics based on personal experiences, and {{that much of the}} album's lyrical content stems from how the September 11 attacks affected him. Moore's brother was a firefighter who worked at the World Trade Center after the attacks, [...] "and I was totally apolitical before this, politically naïve and I still am," [...] Moore stated. [...] "I was like, 'Whoa, <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> <b>is</b> going on in the world?'" ...|$|E

The song (which is based upon Sly and the Family Stone's [...] "Dance to the Music") was released as a single, along with a separate single of remixes titled [...] "Burn the Beat". [...] Both singles were credited to The KLF, marking a change of name and with it a change of musical genre, from The JAMs' sample-fuelled political hip-hop to The KLF's upbeat and uptempo house music.|$|E

500|$|Their debut album, 1987 (<b>What</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fuck</b> <b>Is</b> Going On?), {{had been}} {{investigated}} by the Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society, who in August 1987 ordered The JAMs to recall and destroy all unsold copies of 1987, for its illegal use of extensive samples from ABBA's [...] "Dancing Queen". [...] The JAMs journeyed to Sweden—with their unsold LPs and an NME journalist in tow—in an attempt to negotiate with ABBA. [...] When this failed, The JAMs made a bonfire in the Swedish countryside and burnt the LPs.

[...] Its sleeve depicts the 1987 bonfire, and it contains [...] "Burn the Bastards", a sample-heavy celebration of the fire set to house music. Ritualistic burnings became a recurring aspect of Drummond and Cauty's work, including the burning of a 60-ft (18-m) wicker man during the 1991 summer solstice (The Rites of Mu), and, as the K Foundation in 1995, their burning of £1 million.|$|E
