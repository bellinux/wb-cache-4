25|$|Philosophy is {{sometimes}} {{described as a}} life of reason, with normal human reason pursued in a more consistent and dedicated way than usual. Two categories of problem concerning reason have long been discussed by philosophers concerning reason, essentially being reasonings about reasoning itself as a human aim, or philosophizing about philosophizing. The first question is concerning <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> be confident that reason can achieve knowledge of truth better than other ways of trying to achieve such knowledge. The other question is whether a life of reason, a life that aims to be guided by reason, {{can be expected to}} achieve a happy life more so than other ways of life (whether such a life of reason results in knowledge or not).|$|E
25|$|Recent {{research}} {{reveals a}} potential taste receptor called the CD36 receptor. CD36 was targeted {{as a possible}} lipid taste receptor because it binds to fat molecules (more specifically, long-chain fatty acids), {{and it has been}} localized to taste bud cells (specifically, the circumvallate and foliate papillae). There is a debate over <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> truly taste fats, and supporters of our ability to taste free fatty acids (FFAs) have based the argument on a few main points: there is an evolutionary advantage to oral fat detection; a potential fat receptor has been located on taste bud cells; fatty acids evoke specific responses that activate gustatory neurons, similar to other currently accepted tastes; and, there is a physiological response to the presence of oral fat. Although CD36 has been studied primarily in mice, research examining human subjects' ability to taste fats found that those with high levels of CD36 expression were more sensitive to tasting fat than were those with low levels of CD36 expression; this study points to a clear association between CD36 receptor quantity and the ability to taste fat.|$|E
500|$|Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times {{called the}} film [...] "a queasy glimpse into bargain-basement sleaze." [...] DVD Talk critic Adam Tyner was {{indifferent}} {{about the film}} while watching it, but later concluded that the film is [...] "pretty brilliant". Gordon Sullivan of DVD Verdict thought that the film is ambitious and offers [...] "interesting insights into the modern consumption of horror." [...] Joe Leydon of Variety described the film as an [...] "uncomfortably close look at underground horror", and speculated that it may gain a cult following. David Harley of Bloody Disgusting called S a [...] "must-watch" [...] for anyone that has been scared while watching a horror film {{without being able to}} describe why. In response to the film, Richard Corliss of Time questioned <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> always believe what we see.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, {{by using}} the fixed point theorem of cone, we have {{investigated}} the existence of positive solutions for a class of nonlinear fractional differential equations with integral boundary conditions and have obtained some easily verifiable sufficient criteria which extend previous results. It is worth mentioning {{that there are still}} many problems that remain open in this vital field other than the results obtained in this paper: for example, <b>whether</b> or not <b>we</b> <b>can</b> study the fractional differential equations with integral boundary conditions at resonance (see, e.g., [27]), and <b>whether</b> or not <b>we</b> <b>can</b> give a unified approach applicable to many BVPs (see, e.g., [28 – 31]). More efforts are still needed in the future.|$|R
500|$|Because {{it crosses}} genres, {{fragments}} the characters' experiences, and resists straightforward narrative resolution, Barton Fink is often considered {{an example of}} postmodernist film. In his book Postmodern Hollywood, Booker says the movie renders the past with an impressionist technique, not a precise accuracy. This technique, he notes, is [...] "typical of postmodern film, which views the past not as the prehistory of the present but as a warehouse of images to be raided for material". In {{his analysis of the}} Coens' films, Palmer calls Barton Fink a [...] "postmodern pastiche" [...] which closely examines how past eras have represented themselves. He compares it to The Hours (2002), a film about Virginia Woolf and two women who read her work. He asserts that both films, far from rejecting the importance of the past, add to our understanding of it. He quotes literary theorist Linda Hutcheon: the kind of postmodernism exhibited in these films [...] "does not deny the existence of the past; it does question <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> ever know that past other than through its textualizing remains".|$|E
2500|$|To assert this methodological {{character}} of eternal truths is not, of course, to deny their validity [...] To {{say that we}} assume the truth of abstraction because we wish to attain certain ends, is to subordinate theoretic 'truth' to a teleological implication; to say that, the assumption once made, its truth is 'proved' by its practical working [...] For {{the question of the}} 'practical' working of a truth will always ultimately be found to resolve itself into the question <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> live by it.|$|E
2500|$|A passage {{written by}} Zosimus has been {{interpreted}} {{as one of the}} last mentions of the Chauci, and one where they are specifically mentioned as a Saxon group; but it depends upon <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> equate them with the [...] "Kouadoi" [...] in Zosimus's Greek, a name he had apparently used wrongly. Julian the Apostate fought against Saxons and Franks, including the Salians, but then allowed the Salians [...] "descended from the Franks" [...] to settle in Toxandria in 358. According to Zosimus, this happened in response to an attack from the sea by the [...] "Kouadoi" [...] Saxons which affected both Romans and Salians, who had been living in the river delta.|$|E

50|$|Whoever knows English has {{ready access}} to all the vast {{intellectual}} wealth, which all the wisest nations of the earth have created and hoarded in the course of ninety generations. It may be safely said, that the literature now extant in that language is of far greater value than all the literature which three hundred years ago was extant in all the languages of the world together.The question now before us is simply whether, when it is in our power to teach this language, we shall teach languages, by which, by universal confession, there are not books on any subject which deserve to be compared to our own; <b>whether,</b> when <b>we</b> <b>can</b> teach European science, we shall teach systems which, by universal confession, whenever they differ from those of Europe, differ for the worse; and <b>whether,</b> when <b>we</b> <b>can</b> patronise sound Philosophy and true History, we shall countenance, at the public expense, medical doctrines, which would disgrace an English farrier, --Astronomy, which would move laughter in girls at an English boarding school,--History, abounding with kings thirty feet high, and reigns thirty thousand years long,--and Geography, made up of seas of treacle and seas of butter.|$|R

2500|$|In 2012, Cohen {{sponsored}} the Cohen Amendment reducing infrastructure funding to Afghanistan. The Afghan Infrastructure Fund {{has been plagued}} with problems, with millions of taxpayer dollars disappearing. When {{another member of the}} House said the funding was essential to bringing our troops home, Cohen replied “The {{truth of the matter is}} that it has nothing to do with <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> bring our troops home or not. [...] The truth is that we cannot account for where this money is going, and it is likely going into the pockets of the top one-half of one percent in Afghanistan. [...] The infrastructure holds up well enough there to deploy and redeploy our troops, so it’s good enough to bring them home permanently.” The Amendment passed 228–191 and is the first piece of legislation reducing funding to Afghanistan.|$|E
2500|$|Suppose some given {{data points}} each belong {{to one of}} two classes, and the goal is to decide which class a new data point will be in. In the case of support vector machines, a data point is viewed as a -dimensional vector (a list of [...] numbers), and we want to know <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> {{separate}} such points with a -dimensional hyperplane. This is called a linear classifier. There are many hyperplanes that might classify the data. One reasonable choice as the best hyperplane is the one that represents the largest separation, or margin, between the two classes. So we choose the hyperplane so that the distance from it to the nearest data point on each side is maximized. If such a hyperplane exists, it is known as the maximum-margin hyperplane and the linear classifier it defines is known as a maximum margin classifier; or equivalently, the perceptron of optimal stability.|$|E

But where are we at with the question of <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> actually <b>can</b> regulate the internet? the answer is of course that progress has been made during the 17 years since Jew 2 ̆ 7 s article was published.

30|$|But <b>whether</b> or not <b>we</b> <b>can</b> {{obtain the}} {{existence}} and uniqueness of a positive and nondecreasing solution to the boundary value problem (1.1)-(1.2) still remains unknown.

[...] Phoebe liked the book, she writes [...] "I was unable to put the book down. I found myself enjoying learning exciting new facts and having old ones reinforced. It was definitely no repeat of the classroom scenario... Perhaps the book's greatest asset is that it manages to bring science to life.
