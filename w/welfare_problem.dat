25|$|Blowfly strike, or flystrike is {{a serious}} <b>welfare</b> <b>problem</b> in the animal industry. This {{cutaneous}} myiasis or infestation not only causes severe discomfort or stress to the animal, but will also cause death when left untreated. Ewe lambs and female sheep are primarily affected and are struck predominately in the rear quadrant of the animal due to fecal staining. Due to the difficulty in controlling these flies, there are considerable losses in the sheep industry every year. Also, there is an increasing concern of the insecticidal use and the surgical procedures done to control L. cuprina, making this not only an animal welfare issue but also an economical one. The maggots of L. cuprina rapidly grow while eating the living flesh of the sheep while secreting ammonia, thus, poisoning the sheep. Sheep show signs of skin irritation by rubbing and biting the affected areas {{during the first few}} days after the eggs have been laid. This causes an inflammatory response in the sheep resulting in severe irritation and pyrexia. Once a flystrike has started other flies are attracted to the site. Although treatment is available, the delayed response time due to symptoms allows wool breakage in the affected area and fleece to be tender overall. There are many predispositions to the flystrike that make a host more favorable, including an infection with dermatophilosis and footrot, both of which can be treated and prevented. In some animals a weak resistance can develop, but this immune response is often associated with a decrease in productivity which is an undesirable trait.|$|E

Assessments of the strength of behavioral adaptations in relation to environmental demands were made based on the results available from the literature. The databases with literature at the species level were coupled with databases of (c) behavioral observations and (d) welfare assessments under captive conditions. Observation and welfare assessment methods were adapted from the animal on the farm realm and applied to zoo species.

40|$|Species with {{specific}} environmental adaptations may show specific behavioral adaptations, difficulty in adapting {{to a new}} environment, and hence suboptimal functioning and fitness. Discrepancy between natural behavioral adaptations and behavioral possibilities in captivity may cause <b>welfare</b> <b>problems.</b> Aim of the project is to estimate a species’ suitability for living in captivity, assess welfare, suggest environmental changes, and find species characteristics that underlie <b>welfare</b> <b>problems</b> in zoo animals. Databases of species characteristics are set-up using literature of natural behavior (1) and captive behavior (2). Species characteristics are grouped in eight functional behavioral ecological fitness-related categories related to space, time, metabolic, safety, reproductive, comfort, social and information adaptations using a model of welfare optimization. Assessments {{of the strength of}} behavioral adaptations in relation to environmental needs are made based on results available from literature. The databases with literature on species level are coupled with databases of behavioral observations (3) and welfare assessments (4) under captive conditions. The represented structure produces best professional judgments, shows discrepancies between environmental responses in different environments and suggests ways for improvement (environmental changes). The functional behavioral category approach is compared with and incorporates principles, methods and outcomes developed in the Welfare Quality® project. Behavioral data from many MSc-projects covering 10 Dutch zoos and 45 species are used (mammals, birds and reptiles). In conclusion, the comparison of the complete repertoire of behaviours in natural and zoo environments highlights <b>welfare</b> <b>problems,</b> the solution of <b>welfare</b> <b>problems</b> by environmental changes and the species characteristics underlying zoo animal <b>welfare</b> <b>problems...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Under current practice, normal parent poultry {{breeding}} stock potentially face welfare problems. Intensive selection for production traits, especially growth rate, {{is associated with}} increased nutritious requirement and thus feed consumption, but also reproductive dysfunctions and decreased sexual activity in broiler breeders. A first resulting serious <b>welfare</b> <b>problem</b> is the subsequent severe feed restriction which is applied during rearing, {{in order to prevent}} health problems and to reach better egg production. This severe feed restriction has negative effects on bird welfare as it causes chronic stress resulting from hunger. The use of normal fast growing broiler breeder hens require dedicated programmes of feed restriction, both to maximise egg and chick production and secondly to avoid metabolic disorders and mortality in broiler breeders. The negative correlation between muscle growth and reproduction effectiveness is known as the [...] "broiler breeder paradox".

5000|$|Although {{feather pecking}} occurs in all {{commercial}} housing systems used for egg laying hens, {{it is often}} more prevalent or severe in loose flock systems because it is less easy to control and can spread more rapidly.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between social disadvantages and <b>welfare</b> <b>problems,</b> and assesses the role of collective welfare provision in alleviating the risk of <b>welfare</b> <b>problems.</b> <b>Welfare</b> is studied as a multidimensional phenomenon, and here I examine both distributional aspects, i. e. poverty, and relational aspects of welfare, i. e. social exclusion and social capital. Collective welfare state resources are resources provided by welfare state institutions {{such as health care}} systems and social insurance systems. In this thesis, {{the focus is on the}} level of generosity in the provision of such resources. A long-standing debate within social policy concerns the dilemma between re-distribution on the one hand and the possible detrimental consequences of generous welfare provision on the other. This major debate involves opposing views that disagree on whether generous welfare provision is related to different <b>welfare</b> <b>problems.</b> The overall research question of the thesis is: What are the relationships between social disadvantages and relational and distributional <b>welfare</b> <b>problems,</b> and how are the <b>welfare</b> <b>problems</b> modified by collective welfare provision? According to welfare critics, generous welfare provision may distort people’s capacity to plan and control their lives and pervert norms whereas according to welfare proponents on the other hand, generous welfare provision alleviates poverty and inadequate social participation. In line with the ‘command over resources’ approach, generous welfare provision are believed to improve the conditions that determine choices, strengthen agency and the ability to direct the conditions of life as well as ‘buffer’ the extent to which individual disadvantages in one area are related to disadvantages in another area Three out of four studies (studies I, III and IV) in this thesis contribute to shed light, in different ways, on whether generous welfare provision is related to different <b>welfare</b> <b>problems,</b> and hence provide results that are consistent with either welfare critics on the detrimental consequences of generous welfare provision, or welfare proponents on the benefits of welfare provision. The results of this thesis show that both relational <b>welfare</b> <b>problems,</b> i. e. non-participation in networks (Study I), as well as distributional ones, i. e. material deprivation and income poverty (studies III and IV), invariable decreased as welfare generosity increased. The results on relational <b>welfare</b> <b>problems</b> show that there were no indications of higher levels of social exclusion in more generous welfare states, i. e. the association between welfare generosity and non-participation did not differ between disadvantaged groups and compared to the reference group (Study I). Results on distributional <b>welfare</b> <b>problems</b> show, with few exceptions, that the risk of income poverty and material deprivation decreased with increasing welfare generosity among disadvantaged groups in absolute terms. The absolute inequalities as well as the absolute levels among disadvantaged groups were lower in more generous welfare state contexts (studies III and IV). The low educated benefitted the most from generous welfare provision, compared to other social risk categories, in terms of a substantially lower risk of material deprivation (Study IV). However, findings on both relational as well as distributional <b>welfare</b> <b>problems</b> showed that social inequalities assessed relatively were not necessarily smaller in generous welfare states. Study II based at the individual level in the context of the social capital ‘rich’ and egalitarian country of Norway, show that relational aspects of welfare was not equally available to all, in particular, education seemed to matter for both social trust and civic participation (Study II). The finding of this thesis lends support to the welfare proponents and the view that welfare resources enables participation in society and support the view that generous welfare provision provides disadvantaged individuals with resources to alleviate the risk of poverty. Eventually the views that generous welfare states distort self-efficacy, values and norms, whether these concern the moral obligation towards others or the incentive to work, does not seem justified. The results of this thesis is however, based on cross-sectional data. I am therefore unable to establish causal relations and, hence, present convincing arguments for generous welfare provision in the future. Generous welfare provision introduced in countries with different cultural and institutional conditions will not necessarily increase social participation and alleviate poverty. However, the findings of this thesis, supported by a range of other studies (at both the macro and the micro level), seem to warrant encompassing state intervention and generous welfare provision to handle <b>welfare</b> <b>problems,</b> at least up to now...|$|R

30|$|The outer square symbolises {{the future}} environments for Europe. The European <b>welfare</b> <b>problem</b> is {{different}} from the US or Asian <b>welfare</b> <b>problem.</b> First, the idea of welfare politics is deeply rooted to European ideological history and socio-economic history of national states of Europe. The birth of industrial development started in Europe. This factor was one driver for European welfare politics. Historical context of European welfare politics can be identified in Otto Bismarck’s idea of welfare state and security of citizens [35]. Bismarck created the first welfare state in the modern world in Germany, with the goal of gaining working class support that might otherwise go to his Socialist enemies [41 – 43]. In Asia and US this kind of historical roots of industrialization do not exist or they are less obvious. Also demographic patterns in US and Asia are quite different compared to Europe and European Union. Thirdly, political legitimisation of welfare state is not so strong in Asia and US when we talk about welfare politics [42].|$|E

40|$|In the Submodular <b>Welfare</b> <b>Problem,</b> m {{items are}} to be {{distributed}} among n players with utility functions wi: 2 [m] → R+. The utility functions {{are assumed to be}} monotone and submodular. Assuming that player i receives a set of items Si, we wish to maximize the total utility �n i= 1 wi(Si). In this paper, we work in the value oracle model where the only access to the utility functions is through a black box returning wi(S) for a given set S. Submodular Welfare is in fact a special case of the more general problem of submodular maximization subject to a matroid constraint: max{f(S) : S ∈ I}, where f is monotone submodular and I is the collection of independent sets in some matroid. For both problems, a greedy algorithm is known to yield a 1 / 2 -approximation [21, 17]. In special cases where the matroid is uniform (I = {S: |S | ≤ k}) [20] or the submodular function is of a special type [4, 2], a (1 − 1 /e) -approximation has been achieved and this is optimal for these problems in the value oracle model [22, 6, 15]. A (1 − 1 /e) -approximation for the general Submodular <b>Welfare</b> <b>Problem</b> has been known only in a stronger demand oracle model [4], where in fact 1 − 1 /e can be even improved [9].

A (1 − 1 /e) -approximation for this problem in the demand oracle model has been given by Dobzinski and Schapira [5].

Moreover, this holds even when for each player there are only a constant number of items that have nonzero utility. The constant size restriction on utility functions makes it easy for players to efficiently answer any ”reasonable ” query about their utility functions. In contrast, for classes of instances that were used for previous hardness of approximation results, we present an incentive compatible (in expectation) mechanism based on fair division queries that achieves an optimal solution. ...|$|E

As {{a contribution to the}} debate on this sub-ject, we attempt in this article to determine in what situations the practice of genetic modification in rodents may generate significant <b>welfare</b> <b>problems.</b> After a brief dis-cussion of the principles of animal welfare, we focus on the problem of animal suffer-ing and review some types of gene modifications likely to cause predictable <b>welfare</b> <b>problems.</b> In this article, we also consider suffering that may be involved in the pro-cess of generating GM animals. Finally, we discuss the role of GM animals in at-tempts to reduce, replace, and refine the use of animals in research. In recent years, advances in DNA technology have raised profound public con-cerns about the practice of genetic manipulation of organisms. Among the many questions raised in the general debate is the concern that nonhuman animals gen-erated by the new technology be treated ethically and with consideration for their welfare. Our aim in this article is to address possible <b>welfare</b> <b>problems</b> raised by genetically modified (GM) animals. The discussion is confined to GM rodents in the laboratory, but it should be remembered that GM animals of many different species are now being generated: cow, pig, sheep, and trout amon...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} assess the welfare of farmed rabbits in two {{facilities}} using different housing situations: indoor and outdoor cages.   The welfare parameters assessed were extrapolated from the actual scientific knowledge {{and based on the}} five freedoms. The calculated prevalence of several <b>welfare</b> <b>problems</b> recorded by direct animal assessment was higher in the rabbits kept in indoor cages than outdoors, including very thin body condition (5. 1 % indoors, 0 % outdoors), pododermatitis (15. 4 % indoors, 7. 5 % outdoors), coughing/sneezing (21. 8 % indoors, 5. 7 % outdoors) and fear or aggression during the human arm contact test (33. 3 % and 7. 7 % indoors vs. 28. 3 % and 3. 8 % outdoors, respectively). Yet, some of the problems may be related to poor resource management on the farms, such as the absence of bedding (16. 7 % indoors, 0 % outdoors) or dirty cage floor (80 % indoors, 17 % outdoors). One of the <b>welfare</b> <b>problems</b> recorded in both of the farms was the individual housing of all adult rabbits, without possibility for social contact. According to our results, the welfare of the rabbits housed in outdoor cages during the winter was better, as the prevalence of the <b>welfare</b> <b>problems</b> was lower in these than in the rabbits housed in indoor cages in the same season...|$|R
40|$|<b>Welfare</b> <b>problems</b> {{related to}} the way horses are bred, whether by coitus or by the {{application}} of artificial reproduction techniques (ARTs), have been given no discrete consideration within the academic literature. This paper reviews the existing knowledge base about welfare issues in horse breeding and identifies areas in which data is lacking. We suggest that all methods of horse breeding are associated with potential <b>welfare</b> <b>problems,</b> but also that the judicious use of ARTs can sometimes help to address those problems. We discuss how negative welfare effects could be identified and limited and how positive welfare effects associated with breeding might be maximised. Further {{studies are needed to}} establish an evidence base about how stressful or painful various breeding procedures are for the animals involved, and what the lifetime welfare implications of ARTs are for future animal generations...|$|R
