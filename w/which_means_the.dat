Because the WHT has the largest single mirror at the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos, its realuminising plant has a vacuum vessel {{large enough to accommodate}} the mirrors from any other telescope on the mountain. As a result, all of the other telescopes at the observatory contract to use the WHT plant for their realuminising (with the exception of the Gran Telescopio Canarias, which has its own plant).|$|E

Expectations are that Greece in addition will need a follow-up support programme starting 1 July 2015. The Troika announced the condition for offering Greece (and begin negotiations about) establishment of a follow-up programme would be a prior successful completion of the re-negotiated current programme.|$|E
