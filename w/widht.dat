The two villages employe two different irrigation systems, one technical {{and the other}} non-technical. The study aims at two major objectives, namely: 1) {{the relation between the}} width of agricultural land holding and the income distribution of the different irrigation systems employed in the two villages; and 2) yhe influence of land holding having different irrigation systems on the agricultural income, non agricultural income as well as the household income. The sample include 225 respondents selected in proportion. They consist of 75 respondents that come from the village employing the technial irrigation. And 150 respondents from that employing the non-technical irrigation. The samples are taken in random. The analysis is conducted by means of cross-table analysis, frequency distribution, and product moment correlation. The result of the reasearch show that 1) there is small rate of land holding in two village; 2) {{there is a great deal}} of inequality  of land holding in the two villages in which it is higher in Mranggen than that in Ngombakan (Gini index in Mranggen is 0. 668, where as that in Ngombakan is 0. 602); 3) there is a considerable inequality of agricultural income in which Mranggen is higher than Ngombakan; 4) there is a slight differene of household income in two villages; 5) there is positive correlation between the <b>widht</b> of land holding and the agricultural income, non agricultural income as well as the household income in Mranggen; 6) there is a positive correlation between the <b>widht</b> of land holding and agricultural income but there is no significant correlation between the <b>widht</b> of land holding and the non agricultural income as well as that of the household. The study was found out that the non-agricultural sector is playing an inreasingly important role in the distribution of household income. The inequality of agricultural income in the villages is considerably high but the inequality of the total income as well as that of the income per capita is relatively low. The contribution of the agricultural sector to the total income is lower than that of the non-agricultural.

To do this we have assessed the geomorphic coastal vulnerability taking into account the intensity of storm induced hazards and the adaptation capacity of the system. The methodology aplied allows to calculate quantitatively -in a separate manner- the erosion and inundation hazards induced by the storms associated to a given probability of occurrence. The practical application of this method is to provide information that allows stakeholders to manage resource allocation and mitigate consequences. This framework has been developed by covering the following steps:(i). Define forcing conditions for the Sardinian coast using a storm classification method; to obtain this we have divided the Sardinian coast in 4 different sectors. For each sector storm events have been defined from hindcast wave data obtained for the period between 1979 - 2012. (ii) Find out the induced beach response to each storm class measured by the quantification of the flooding and erosion hazards. In each sector sandy beaches have been characterized in terms of their slope, height, <b>widht</b> and grain size. (iii) Estimation of a coastal vulnerability index formulated in terms of these two intermediate variables by means of a linear function that ranges from a minimum value of 0 (optimum state) to a maximum of 1 (failure state), defining 5 qualitative categories (Very Low, Low,. Medium, High, Very High). (iv) Assessment and mapping of the coastal vulnerability index along different sectors of the island. In terms of prospective analysis we have built a projected timeline of beach hazard based on existing storm data fitted into an extreme probability function. Once the probability of occurrence of the flooding and erosion hazards has been assessed and a risk level defined by the stakeholders, the spatial distribution of vulnerabilities associated to selected probability level will permit to "robustly" compare areas along the coast to identify the most endangered zones...|$|E
40|$|Quasi-resonant (QR), multi-resonant (MR), and quasi-square-wave (QSW) {{converters}} {{are obtained}} by using resonant switches in conventional PWM (Pulse <b>Widht</b> Modulated) converter topologies, i. e. {{by adding a}} capacitor and/or an inductor to the switch. The current and voltage in the switch have quasi-sinusoidal waveforms, thus allowing either zero-current switching (ZCS) or zero-voltage switching (ZVS). As a result, higher switching frequency, with lower switching losses, and less E. M. I. are achived, leading to reduce volume and weight, and to increased efficiency. The DC output voltage of converters with resonant switches is, usually, regulated by frequency modulation, since PWM control is incompatible with the ZVS or ZCS conditions. This variable-frequency control is very undersirable. One of the main objectives of this thesis is to investigate constant-frequency control of converters with resonant switches. A new method for constant-frequency control of QWS-ZVS converters that creates dead times (or waiting stages) is presented. It is Known that current-model control of PWM converters has significant advantages {{with respect to the}} more basic voltage-mode control, because the output current is limited, and the dynamic performance is improved. The other main objective of this thesis is to investigate whether current-mode control of QR and QSW-ZVS converters is possible and, if so, whether it has similar advantages to those that apply tp PWM converters. For this purpose, small-signal models are obtained {{as an extension of the}} state space averaging models of PWM converters. Control laws for both control-modes, for types of QR and QSW-ZVS converters, are obtained. These control laws small-signal models are used to perform a comparative study of QR converters with current-mode and with voltage-mode which shows that current-mode control provides similar advantages to those that apply to PWM converters; as to QSW-ZVS converters, the study that, contrarily to what PWM converters, curent-mode control does not provide improved dynamic performance with respect to voltage-mode control. In addition to computer simulations to confirm the small-signal models, an experimental buck QSW-ZVS converter with constant-frequency control was built and tested.

40|$|The subaerial beache act as detritical {{barriers}} {{in the opening}} and closing of lagoons located in sandy coastal ares. The study of beach morphodynamics, considering {{the evolution of the}} beachface and the berm, in these cases is critical to coastal management. The studied area located in an embayed sandy coastline at the Portuguese Southwest Atlantic Coast, is a 308 m long subaerial, coarse to very coarse, sandy beach adjacent to the Melides lagoon entrance. In order to characterize the morphodynamics of the study area under the effects of storms (pre and post-storm) and tides (spring and neap tides) during a period of one year (April 2010 to April 2011), 26 field surveys were conducted. A survey grid with an alongshore lenght of 308 m and a <b>widht</b> of 14 - 40 m defined between the lower limit of the beachface and the backshore limit (entrance of the coastal lagoon or frontal dune) was used. We performed 12 cross-shore profiles 40 m apart from each other. The alongshore profiles describes the main topographic variations (e. g. top of the beachface, berms elevation, beach cusps definition). Horizontal and vertical positioning was provided by Real-Time Kinematics (RTK) GPS. The results obtained allowed to develop high resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEM) using the ArcGIS software. DEM models were use to describe beach morphologicnd changes. The nearshore wave characteristics were described by the SWAN wave model considering as boundary conditions the wave data recorded at the Sines wave rider buoy. The run-up levels were calculated using the wave parameters and the beachface slope (0. 12 to 0. 18). During the study period were documented two episodes of opening and closing of the Melides lagoon due to storms effect, and one artificial opening episode. A conceptual model for the reconstruction of the sandy beach detritical barrier that controls the opening and closing of the lagoon was performed. This study shows that the evolution of the sandy beach detritical barrier is characterized by a cyclical behaviour of recovery marked by the occurrence of storms. The developed conceptual model is characterized by rapid sediment transport between the submarine beach and the beachface. The incidence of more energetic storms (Hs= 5 m) induces the destruction of the sandy beach detritical barrier leaving open the Melides lagoon to the Atlantic Ocean. Due to storms the beach profile is destroyed and about 1. 9 x 10 3 m 3 of sand is remobilized above - 0. 5 m (MSL). Beach recovers much of its original morphology and sediment volume 10 - 12 days after the storm. At the stage of equilibrium, the sandy beach detritical barrier presents a wide berm (35 m), a berm with an elevation close to 5 m (MSL) and a reflective beachface. This study was funded by the Administração da Região Hidrográfica do Alentejo (ARH). Bathemetric source was provided by GEBCO_ 08 Grid and the wave data by the Instituto Hidrográfico (Portugal) web site...|$|E
40|$|El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is {{the most}} {{important}} and studied phenomenon affecting the climate variability at interannual timescales. As the name suggests, ENSO consists of two related aspects which fluctuate periodically in an irregular way. The first, El Nino, is associated to an increase in the sea surface temperature (SST) along the coasts of Ecuador and Peru, whereas the second one, the Southern Oscillation, is related to changes in the east-west pressure gradient leading to the movement of air masses in the atmosphere along the Pacific Equator line (Walker's circulation). Over the years, a number of models have been developed in order to fully understand this phenomenon both qualitatively and quantitatively. These models usually rely on more or less strong approximations of the fluid dynamic equations which regulate the atmospheric and oceanic dynamics. These approximations are {{based on the fact that}} the ENSO phenomenon involves a very thin layer of the ocean along the Pacific Equator, i. e. a strip of water 15000 km long, few hundreds km <b>widht</b> and with an average dept of some tens of meters. This very elongated strip of water, behaves like a river that has the source at the extreme east, the sink at the west boundary, and it is driven by the rotation of the Earth and by the westerly trade winds. This simplifyed scheme of the ocean dynamics, along the Pacific Equator, leads to a reduced set of equations in which one or more stochastic terms are introduced. The stochastic terms are used to simulate the fluctuations in periodicity and intensity of the phenomenon, generated by the interaction between the ocean and the atmosphere (Recharge oscillator models, ROM). In recent works, Dr. Marco Bianucci has developed a different general approach, based on projection techniques, that allows to couple a generic system under examination (in this case the oceanic variables) with a deterministic system that correctly reproduces the contribution of the stochastic forcing. This technique, applied to a model which reproduces the ENSO phenomenon, allows us to derive a partial differential equation which describe the statistics of two ENSO relevant variables: the anomalies of the average thermocline depth (h) and the estern Pacific SST (T), respectively. This last, in particular, is considered the main variable which identifies the phenomenon of Nino, when T> 0, or la Nina, when T< 0. Under appropriate hypothesis, this PDE can be reduced to a Fokker-Plank equation (FPE), which will be the core of this work. The present thesis concerns mainly in the study and the realisation of a software that allows the numerical resolution of the Fokker-Plank equation for the ENSO phenomenon. This software has made it possible to obtain the probability density function (PDF) for the stationary state in the two-dimensional space (h,T) and a reduced form of it for the sole variable T. This reduced PDF was directly compared to the analytical results obtained in the foundamental work of Dr. Marco Bianucci. These theoretic results are particularly important since allow a direct and immediate comparison with the data obtained from the observation of the ENSO phenomenon. Nevertheless these result are obtained by adopting an hypothesis ("the ansatz") which is assumed to be approximately correct: one of the aim of the present thesis is to verify, through the numerical solution of the Fokker-Planck equation, the validity or not of this hypothesis. Subsequently it was performed the numerical integration of the stochastic equations associated to the previously PDE in order to calculate the quantities related to the periodicity and the intensity of extreme El Nino events. To this end it was calculated the mean first passage time (MFPT) corresponding to El Nino events of great intensity and this result was compared with the available observations for the ENSO phenomenon and with the analytical results stemming from standard MFPT techniques applied to the reduced model...|$|E
