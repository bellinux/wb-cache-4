5|$|In principle, the {{simultaneous}} occurrence of a Solar eclipse and a transit {{of a planet}} is possible. But these events are extremely rare because of their short durations. The next anticipated simultaneous occurrence of a Solar eclipse and a transit of Mercury <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> July 5, 6757, and a Solar eclipse and a transit of Venus is expected on April 5, 15232.|$|E

5|$|The last transit of Venus was on 5 and 6 June 2012, and was {{the last}} Venus transit of the 21st century; the prior transit took place on 8 June 2004. The {{previous}} pair of transits were in December 1874 and December 1882. The next transits of Venus <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> 10–11 December 2117, and 8 December 2125.|$|E
5|$|Central eclipse {{is often}} used as a generic term for a total, annular, or hybrid eclipse. This is, however, not {{completely}} correct: {{the definition of a}} central eclipse is an eclipse during which the central line of the umbra touches the Earth's surface. It is possible, though extremely rare, that part of the umbra intersects with the Earth (thus creating an annular or total eclipse), but not its central line. This is then called a non-central total or annular eclipse. The last (umbral yet) non-central solar eclipse was on April 29, 2014. This was an annular eclipse. The next non-central total solar eclipse <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> April 9, 2043.|$|E

The point we are making is that if we don't protect these folk arts, they <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> their way out.|$|E

5|$|In July 2004 Massino {{was convicted}} in a murder and {{racketeering}} indictment based on the testimony of several cooperating made men, including Massino's disgruntled underboss and brother-in-law Salvatore Vitale. He was also facing the death penalty if convicted in a separate murder trial due to be held later that year, but after agreeing to testify against his former associates {{he was sentenced to}} life imprisonment for both indictments in 2005. Massino testified twice for the government, helping win a murder conviction against his acting boss Vincent Basciano in 2011, and was resentenced to time served in 2013, though he <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> supervised release {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|Scientific jury selection, often {{abbreviated}} SJS, {{is the use}} {{of social}} science techniques and expertise to choose favorable juries during a criminal or civil trial. Scientific jury selection is used during the jury selection phase of the trial—when lawyers have the opportunity to question jurors and they and the judge choose which people <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the jury. It almost always entails an expert's assistance in the attorney's use of peremptory challenges—the right to reject a certain number of potential jurors without stating a reason—during jury selection. The practice is currently confined to the American legal system.|$|E
5|$|Some {{critics argue}} that Swift {{did not need to}} defend himself, and To Viscount Molesworth was written to gloat. However, the essence of the letter {{encourages}} the Irish to remember the actions of Walpole, Wood, and the British Parliament. By willingly throwing himself before the judgement of his fellow Irishmen and before the final judgement of God, the Drapier claims that he is and always <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the correct side of the argument.|$|E

5|$|Asche {{began the}} 2015 season among the team's hottest hitters, and a {{mainstay}} {{in the lineup}} as the team's starting third baseman. However, in late April, he began working on skills as an outfielder, ostensibly {{in preparation for the}} arrival of minor league prospect Maikel Franco, regarded as a stronger defensive third baseman. In fact, the Phillies optioned Asche back to Triple-A on May 12 to accelerate his development as a left fielder, as Franco was hitting very well in the minor leagues, and could be ready for a promotion. Although surprised and disappointed by the move, Asche sought to trust the organization and play wherever it needed him. Ultimately, Asche struggled to find playing time during the remainder of the season, although MLB.com writer Todd Zolecki said that Asche would be given an opportunity in 2016 as the Phillies like his makeup, but the burden <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> him to produce results to justify the playing time, given the amelioration of other options at his positions.|$|E
5|$|Logan tells Parker that he {{will not}} be seeing her in the summer because he <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> a surfing trip with Dick. Mac (Tina Majorino) and Max (Adam Rose) spend all their time together. Piz tells Veronica about another {{internship}} in Neptune, but she dodges his attempts to ask which one he should take. Keith meets Liam Fitzpatrick (Rod Rowland), who states that the robberies will not stop. Apollo learns that Veronica was not assigned by the school paper, and Veronica tells him the truth, but he refuses a paternity test. Some people begin to grow dissatisfied with Keith’s handling of the robberies, while Apollo’s father claimant appears in Neptune. Veronica searches for Apollo, learning from his former roommate that Apollo did not actually write the book, and he was never a child soldier. However, Wallace (Percy Daggs III) urges her not to expose him as a hoax, as his book as actually helping charities that aid child soldiers.|$|E

5|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{occurrence of}} a transit of Mercury and a transit of Venus does occur, but extremely infrequently. Such an event last occurred on 22 September 373,173 BC and will next occur on 26 July 69,163, {{and again on}} 29 March 224,508. The simultaneous occurrence of a solar eclipse and a transit of Venus is currently possible, but very rare. The next solar eclipse occurring during a transit of Venus <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> 5 April 15,232. The last time a solar eclipse occurred during a transit of Venus was on 1 November 15,607 BC. The day after the Venerean transit of 3 June 1769 there was a total solar eclipse, which was visible in Northern America, Europe and Northern Asia.|$|E
