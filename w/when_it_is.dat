5|$|In {{the early}} first {{millennium}} BC, Babylonian astronomers {{observed that the}} Sun's motion along the ecliptic is not uniform, though {{they did not know}} why; it is today known that {{this is due to the}} movement of Earth in an elliptic orbit around the Sun, with Earth moving faster <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> nearer to the Sun at perihelion and moving slower <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> farther away at aphelion.|$|E

5|$|A highsider, highside, or {{high side}} {{is a type of}} bike motion which is caused by a rear wheel gaining {{traction}} <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not facing in the direction of travel, usually after slipping sideways in a curve. This can occur under heavy braking, acceleration, a varying road surface, or suspension activation, especially due to interaction with the drive train.

5|$|A {{preliminary}} {{examination of the}} imagery suggests that S/2015 (136472) 1 has a reflectivity similar to charcoal, making it an extremely dark object. This is somewhat surprising because Makemake is the second-brightest known object in the Kuiper belt. One hypothesis to explain this is that its gravity is {{not strong enough to}} prevent bright but volatile ices from being lost to space <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> heated by the distant Sun.|$|E
5|$|Although less used, the {{separability}} {{assumption is}} considered more general because every stochastic process has a separable version. It {{is also used}} <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not possible to construct a stochastic process in a Skorokhod space. For example, separability is assumed when constructing and studying random fields, where the collection of random variables is now indexed by sets other than the real line such as -dimensional Euclidean space.|$|E
5|$|An {{emergency}} procedure enabling an Act {{to come into}} force {{at the same moment}} as the receipt of the equivalent of the royal assent, <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> being announced at an ordinary sitting of the Tynwald, subject to its being promulgated within 12 months, was introduced in 1916; since 1988, this has been the normal procedure, but an Act ceases to have effect unless promulgated within 18 months after the equivalent of the royal assent is announced in the Tynwald.|$|E
50|$|Hill House {{was built}} in around 1760 by John Hill (1729-1789) and was owned by his {{descendants}} until 1883 <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> leased to various tenants until 1902 <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> bought by Walter Draper.

5|$|At the {{transport}} layer, most communication adopts either the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). TCP is used <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> essential every message sent is {{received by the}} other computer whereas UDP is used <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> merely desirable. With TCP, packets are retransmitted if they are lost and placed in order before they are presented to higher layers. With UDP, packets are not ordered or retransmitted if lost. Both TCP and UDP packets carry port numbers with them to specify what application or process the packet should be handled by. Because certain application-level protocols use certain ports, network administrators can manipulate traffic to suit particular requirements. Examples are to restrict Internet access by blocking the traffic destined for a particular port or to affect the performance of certain applications by assigning priority.|$|E
5|$|Because {{surface tension}} {{manifests itself in}} various effects, it offers a number of paths to its measurement. Which method is optimal depends upon {{the nature of the}} liquid being measured, the {{conditions}} under which its tension is to be measured, and the stability of its surface <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> deformed.|$|E
5|$|Boccaccio {{introduces}} {{a number of}} features {{of the story that}} were to be taken up by Chaucer. Most obvious is that Troilus' love is now called Criseida or Cressida. An innovation in the narrative is the introduction of the go-between Pandarus. Troilus is characterised as a young man who expresses whatever moods he has strongly, weeping when his love is unsuccessful, generous <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Canadian Players of the Year are {{determined}} by voting from Canadian media and coaches, save for 2002 <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> determined by fan voting, and 2005 and 2006 <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> determined by fans and media voting. The Canadian U-20 Player of the Year was determined by fans and media voting until 2007, from <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> determined by the voting of Canadian coaches.|$|R

50|$|The town of Marion {{was founded}} in 1888, and {{changed its name to}} Ashburn <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{incorporated}} in 1890. Ashburn was designated seat of Turner County <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> established in 1905.|$|R
5|$|Each cause presupposes the {{existence}} of the next cause, but the next cause does not necessarily pre-suppose {{the existence}} of the previous cause.

5|$|Europium {{becomes a}} {{superconductor}} <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> cooled below 1.8 K and compressed to above 80 GPa. This is because europium is divalent in the metallic state, and is converted into the trivalent state by the applied pressure. In the divalent state, the strong local magnetic moment (J = 7/2) suppresses the superconductivity, which is induced by eliminating this local moment (J = 0 in Eu3+).|$|E
5|$|Exposure to oxygen (diradical) {{converts}} this carbene to {{the corresponding}} benzophenone and the diphenylmethane compound is formed <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> trapped by 1,4-cyclohexadiene. As {{with the other}} carbenes this species contains large bulky substituents, namely bromine and the trifluoromethyl groups, that shield the carbene and prevent or slow down the process of dimerisation to a 1,1,2,2-tetra(phenyl)alkene.|$|E

40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of tazobactam (500 mg) administered intravenously alone {{were compared}} with the pharmacokinetics of tazobactam coadministered with piperacillin (4 g), and the penetration into an inflammatory exudate in six healthy males was studied. Piperacillin influenced the pharmacokinetics of tazobactam. The mean levels of tazobactam in plasma at 4 h were 0. 6 microgram/ml <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> given alone and 1. 2 micrograms/ml <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> given with piperacillin (P = 0. 0003). The mean total clearances of tazobactam were 203. 5 and 134. 2 ml/min (P = 0. 035) <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> given alone and with piperacillin, respectively There {{were no significant differences}} in the elimination half lives, areas under the concentration-time curve from 0 h to infinity, or volumes of distribution. Inflammatory exudate penetration was rapid, and the mean maximum levels of tazobactam attained were 6. 4 and 11. 3 micrograms/ml <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> given alone or with piperacillin, respectively (P less than 0. 06). The mean percent penetration of tazobactam and the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 h to infinity in inflammatory exudate were greater when tazobactam was given with piperacillin. The mean 24 -h urinary recoveries of tazobactam were 63. 7 % +/- 7. 9 % <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> given alone and 56. 8 % +/- 2. 7 % <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> given with piperacillin.
