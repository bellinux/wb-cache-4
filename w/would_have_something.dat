5|$|Freda's {{ambition}} {{to make a}} horror film derived from his desire to make films in the fantastique style, feeling that only the Americans and German expressionists {{were able to make}} such films in the past. Freda approached film producer Luigi Carpentieri with the idea of the film despite not having a treatment ready. Promising them that he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> for them by the next day, he returned with a tape of his treatment that was complete with sound effects. Carpentieri phoned Goffredo Lombardo to convince him further. Freda followed up his tape with the promise that his script could pass the censors and could be filmed in 12 days. This convinced the producer who allowed Freda to create what became I Vampiri. I Vampiri was a low-budget production with Donati and Capentieri of Athena and Lombardo's Titanus investing 32 million lire each initially into the film. The initial budget was 97 million Italian lire which increased to 142 million for its post-production and release after the films format was switched to panoramic CinemaScope.|$|E

It was a project of Walter P. Chrysler for his children. In his autobiography, Chrysler wrote {{that he wanted to}} erect the building [...] "so that his sons <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> to be responsible for".|$|E
500|$|While {{automobiles}} made it {{much easier}} for black Americans to be independently mobile, the difficulties they faced in traveling were such that, as Lester B. Granger of the National Urban League puts it, [...] "so far as travel is concerned, Negroes are America's last pioneers." [...] Black travelers often had to carry buckets or portable toilets in the trunks of their cars because they were usually barred from bathrooms and rest areas in service stations and roadside stops. Travel essentials such as gasoline were difficult to purchase because of discrimination at gas stations. To avoid such problems on long trips, African Americans often packed meals and carried containers of gasoline in their cars. Writing of the road trips that he made as a boy in the 1950s, Courtland Milloy of the Washington Post recalled that his mother spent the evening before the trip frying chicken and boiling eggs so that his family <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> to eat along the way the next day.|$|E

500|$|... "Moment of Surrender" [...] {{was written}} by U2 and No Line on the Horizon producers/co-writers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois during a two-week {{recording}} session in Fez, Morocco between May and June 2007. The song was developed within a few hours, and then recorded in a single take in a riad of the hotel Riad El Yacout. Eno began by creating a percussion loop of a [...] "rolling hand drum" [...] so that the band <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> to improvise along with when they joined him for songwriting and recording. However, Eno had not arranged the loop properly {{and the result was}} a strange, uneven beat that he compared to [...] "a wheeled carriage that had one of the wheels a bit cracked" [...] or [...] "the way a camel moves". Although Eno was trying to fix the loop, drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. began playing along to it. Eno then asked guitarist the Edge to play some chords. After a quick discussion about the chord changes and the meter (in which they decided to have a [...] "funny layout" [...] that was not based on [...] "eighths or sixteenths"), the six of them improvised the entirety of the piece.|$|E
500|$|Following his mother's {{successful}} {{career as a}} divorce lawyer, {{the family moved to}} Beverly Hills, where Schwimmer attended Beverly Hills High School. Schwimmer admitted to being an outsider during his time at the school, recalling, [...] "When I was there I always felt: 'This is not me, I'm surrounded by people with a different value system. And I just {{wanted to get out of}} California.'" [...] He was best at the subjects of science and math and thought he would become a doctor. Schwimmer enrolled in a drama class, where he appeared in stage productions. Encouraged by his school drama teacher to further his acting, he flew to Chicago for an acting workshop. He noted that the experience was both [...] "enlightening and exhilarating". In 1984, Schwimmer graduated from Beverly Hills High and wanted to go straight into acting, but his parents insisted he go to college first so he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> to fall back on. Schwimmer moved to Chicago to attend Northwestern University, where he had attended a summer drama course when he was 16 years old. At the university, he studied theater and was in an improv group with Stephen Colbert, the No-Fun Mud Piranhas. After graduating in 1988, with a Bachelor of Arts degree in theater and speech, Schwimmer co-founded the Lookingglass Theatre Company. Subsequently, he returned to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career.|$|E
500|$|However, {{the truth}} of the {{accounts}} has been disputed by some historians; in 1984, Malcolm Brown and Shirley Seaton concluded that there were probably attempts to play organised matches which failed due to the state of the ground, but that the contemporary reports were either hearsay or refer to [...] "kick-about" [...] matches with [...] "made-up footballs" [...] such as a bully-beef tin. Chris Baker, former chairman of The Western Front Association and author of The Truce: The Day the War Stopped is also sceptical, but says that although there is little hard evidence, the most likely place that an organised match could have taken place was near the village of Messines: [...] "There are two references to a game being played on the British side, but nothing from the Germans. If somebody one day found a letter from a German soldier who was in that area, then we <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> credible." [...] In fact, there is a German reference. Leutnant Kurt Zehmisch of Germany's 134th Saxons Infantry Regiment said that the English [...] "brought a soccer ball from their trenches, and pretty soon a lively game ensued. How marvelously wonderful, yet how strange it was". In 2011, Mike Dash concluded that [...] "there is plenty of evidence that football was played that Christmas Day—mostly by men of the same nationality, but in at least three or four places between troops from the opposing armies".|$|E

2500|$|The {{album cover}} {{features}} the {{four members of}} the band after they were hit by pies. Guitarist Brian James recalled: [...] "That was organised by this photographer called Peter Kodick, Stiff had assigned him to do the thing. They thought it was a jolly wheeze to surprise us with a few cream cakes, little knowing that we would relish it, get into to it and enjoy the whole experience". After the photo session, Damned bassist Captain Sensible noted: [...] "...I had more pie on my face {{than any of the other}} buggers and on the back of the sleeve I had my back to the picture, so I went down a photo booth and got some pictures, cut one out and said 'put that on there' so I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> to show my relatives, because I didn't think we'd be invited to make another album".|$|E
2500|$|The authorship of the Commodore 64 titles was at {{the time}} even more uncertain. The {{conversions}} of existing Spectrum games Sabre Wulf, Underwurlde and Nightshade were handled by Firebird, who hired Mr Micro, Softstone, and PSI, respectively, to develop the titles. Imhotep was submitted to Ultimate in a virtually complete form by author Manuel Caballero, who had previously written Batty Builders and Firefleet. Ultimate did not make any announcements regarding the authorship of the other Commodore games, but an article by Martyn Carroll revealed how Frank Gasking of [...] "Games that weren't 64" [...] managed to identify the creators as Dave and Robert (Bob) Thomas based on a message that appears on the final screen of Dragonskulle. These two brothers were also the creators of the previous three games of the series The Staff of Karnath, Entombed and Blackwyche, In an interview with the brothers in Retro Gamer magazine, they revealed they also authored Outlaws, in just six weeks, so Ultimate <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> for the Commodore 64 for Christmas.|$|E
2500|$|Powell {{wrote an}} article for The Times on 29 June, in which he said: [...] "The Falklands have brought {{to the surface of}} the British mind our latent {{perception}} of ourselves as a sea animal.... No assault on a landward possession would have evoked the same automatic defiance, tinged with a touch of that self sufficiency which belongs to all nations". The United States' response was [...] "very different but just as deep an instinctual reaction... the United States have an almost neurotic sense of vulnerability... its two coastlines, its two theatres, its two navies are separated by the entire length of the New World... she lives with... the nightmare of having one day to fight a decisive sea battle without the benefit of concentration, the perpetual spectre of naval 'war on two fronts'." [...] Powell added: [...] "The Panama Canal from 1914 onwards could never quite exorcise the spectre.... It was the position of the Falkland Islands in relation to that route which gave and gives them their significance—for the United States above all. The British people have become uneasily aware that their American allies would prefer the Falkland Islands to pass out of Britain's possession into hands which, if not wholly American, might be amenable to American control. In fact, the American struggle to wrest the islands from Britain has only commenced in earnest now that the fighting is over". Powell then said there was [...] "the Hispanic factor": [...] "If we could gather together all the anxieties for the future which in Britain cluster around race relations... and then attribute them, translated into Hispanic terms, to the Americans, we <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> of the phobias which haunt the United States and addressed itself to the aftermath of the Falklands campaign".|$|E
