40|$|The {{aerosphere}} is {{utilized by}} billions of birds, moving {{for different reasons}} and from short to great distances spanning {{tens of thousands of}} kilometres. The aerosphere, however, is also utilized by aviation creating increasing conflicts in and around airfields as well as en-route. Collisions between birds and aircraft cost billions of euros annually and, in some cases, result in the loss of human lives. Simultaneously, aviation has diverse negative impacts on wildlife. During avian migration, due to the sheer numbers of birds in the air, the risk of bird strikes becomes particularly acute especially for military aviation. Over the last few decades, air forces across Europe and the Middle East have been developing solutions that integrate ecological research and aviation policy to reduce mutual negative interactions between birds and aircraft. The aims of this study are (1) to provide a brief overview of the systems currently used in aviation to monitor bird migration movements in the aerosphere, (2) to estimate their impact and effectiveness in bird strike avoidance, and (3) to show the integral role of operational <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> <b>networks.</b> We compare systems in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Poland and Israel, areas that are crossed twice a year by huge fluxes of Palearctic migrants. We focus mainly on en-route conflicts and migration forecast systems. In addition, we describe how civil aviation can benefit from these military developments.

40|$|Piemonte region, in the {{north-western}} Italy, {{is characterized}} by complex orography and Mediterranean influence that often causes extreme rainfall event, during the warm season. Although the region is monitored by a dense gauge network (more than one gauge per 100 km 2), the ground measurements are often inadequate to properly observe intense and highly variable precipitations. Polarimetric <b>weather</b> <b>radars</b> provide a unique way to monitor rainfall over wide areas, with the required spatial detail and temporal resolution. Nevertheless, most European <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> <b>networks</b> are operating at C-band, which may seriously limit quantitative precipitation estimation in heavy rainfall due to relevant power signal attenuation. Phase measurements, unlike power measurements, are not affected by signal attenuation. For this reason, polarimetric radars, for which the differential phase shift measurements are available, provide an additional way in which to estimate precipitation, which is immune to signal attenuation. In this work differential phase based rainfall estimation techniques are applied to analyze two flash-floods: the first one occurred on the Ligurian Apennines on 16 August 2006 and the second occurred on 13 September 2008, causing rain accumulations above 270 mm in few hours...|$|R

50|$|Polarimetric {{methods are}} {{considered}} to be a powerful tool in the remote sensing of the atmosphere, and particularly in radar observations of clouds and precipitation. Polarimetric techniques have been well developed for operational use in <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> <b>networks</b> such as American NEXRAD and European OPERA, and, currently, are being implemented in ground based and airborne cloud radars. These techniques enable advanced clutter filtering, discrimination between meteorological and non-meteorological targets, and classification of atmospheric scatterers. Another potential of polarimetric measurements of cloud radars is the estimation of ice crystals habit {{that is one of the}} main problems in remote observations of mixed-phase clouds. The assumed shape of ice crystals is considered to be the main source of errors in size and number concentration retrievals based on vertical combined lidar and radar observations. Furthermore, in the existing numerical weather prediction models the assumed shape defines the depositional growth rate of ice particles and the area-mass-terminal velocity relations of ice crystals. Thus, ice habit can lead to significant uncertainties.|$|R
40|$|<b>Weather</b> <b>radar</b> {{imagery is}} a {{valuable}} new technique for the rapid recovery of meteorite falls, to include falls which would not otherwise be recovered (e. g. Battle Mountain). <b>Weather</b> <b>radar</b> imagery reveals about one new meteorite fall per year (18 falls since 1998), using <b>weather</b> <b>radars</b> in the United States alone. However, an additional ~ 75 other nations operate <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> <b>networks</b> according to the UN World Meteorological Organization (WMO). If the imagery of those radars were analyzed, {{the current rate of}} meteorite falls could be improved considerably, to as much as ~ 3. 6 times the current recovery rate based on comparison of total radar areal coverage. Recently, the addition of <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> imagery, seismometry and internet-based aggregation of eyewitness reports has improved the speed and accuracy of fresh meteorite fall recovery [e. g. 1, 2]. This was demonstrated recently with the radar-enabled recovery of the Sutter's Mill fall [3]. Arguably, the meteorites recovered via these methods are of special scientific value as they are relatively unweathered, fresh falls. To illustrate this, a recent SAO/NASA ADS search using the keyword "meteorite" shows that all 50 of the top search results included at least one named meteorite recovered from a meteorite fall. This is true even though only ~ 1260 named meteorite falls are recorded among the > 49, 000 individual falls recorded in the Meteoritical Society online database. The US NEXRAD system used thus far to locate meteorite falls covers most of the United States' surface area. Using a WMO map of the world's <b>weather</b> <b>radars,</b> we estimate that the total coverage of the other ~ 75 national <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> <b>networks</b> equals about 3. 6 x NEXRAD's coverage area. There are two findings to draw from this calculation: 1) For the past 16 years during which 18 falls are seen in US radar data, there should be an additional ~ 65 meteorite falls recorded in worldwide radar imagery. Also: 2) if all of the world's radar data could be analyzed, the rate of recovery of fresh meteorite falls can increase by as much as ~ 3. 6 x the current rate. The authors' experience to date indicates that the most effective course of action would be to have local meteorite research groups (outside of the US) form research consortia and develop a working relationship with their nation's weather bureau for access to data. These research consortia could utilize the same, proven methods used for US NEXRAD imagery, internet eyewitness report aggregation, seismometry analysis, etc. to locate meteorite falls. The consortia could then recover and analyze meteorite falls and enrich their own research efforts. It would be beneficial to conduct a global program to coordinate the development of methods and data tools, as well as to coordinate meteorite sample sharing and research. Perhaps an institution such as the Meteoritical Society could lead such an effort...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Distributed <b>networks</b> of {{short-range}} <b>radars</b> {{offer the}} potential to observe winds and rainfall at high spatial resolution in volumes of the troposphere that are unobserved by today’s long-range <b>weather</b> <b>radars.</b> Future distributed <b>radar</b> <b>networks</b> will involve thousands of small radars, and the design of these systems will be conducted in a trade-space that balances requirements among radar sensing, communications, networking, and distributed computation functions while addressing infrastructure constraints (such as size, weight, space, and prime power requirements) to achieve cost-effective designs. This paper presents preliminary work {{on the development of}} “Off-The-Grid ” (OTG) <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> <b>networks.</b> These are envisioned as self-contained networks of small remote-sensing / communication / computation nodes, each occupying a volume of 1. 5 m 3 and capable of operating independent of the wired power and communication infrastructure. Operating a <b>radar</b> <b>network</b> independently of the electrical grid will require understanding the energy requirements for sensing. This paper will present the current progress {{in the development of the}} energy balancing algorithms necessary for OTG operation. Included in this paper will be an energy consumption model for OTG network analysis. The energy model includes the energy cost associated with the three main functions (sensing, computing, communicating) of each radar node in an OTG network. The energy consumption model is a fundamental component of an OTG network emulator that will allow for the testing of the energy balancing algorithms. This paper will present the OTG node energy model that has been developed and that will be used to analyze the developing energy balancing algorithms.

50|$|The 1953 Waco tornado {{outbreak}} sequence was {{a series}} of at least 33 tornadoes occurring in 10 different U.S. states on May 9-11, 1953. Tornadoes appeared daily from Minnesota in the north to Texas in the south. The strongest and deadliest tornado of the severe weather event was a powerful F5 on the Fujita scale. It struck Waco, Texas, on May 11, causing 114 of the 144 deaths in the outbreak sequence. Alongside the 1902 tornado in Goliad, it was the deadliest tornado in Texas history and is the eleventh deadliest tornado in U.S. history. The tornado's winds demolished more than 600 houses, 1,000 other structures, and over 2,000 vehicles. Nearly 600 injuries occurred, and many survivors had to wait over 14 hours for rescue. The destruction dispelled a myth that the geography of the region spared Waco from tornadoes, and along with other deadly tornadoes in 1953, the Waco disaster was a catalyst for advances in understanding the link between tornadoes and radar-detected hook echoes.

40|$|The Sutter’s Mill C-type {{meteorite}} fall {{occurred on}} 22 April 2012 {{in and around}} the town of Coloma, California. The exact location of the meteorite fall was determined within hours of the event using a combination of eyewitness reports, <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> imagery, and seismometry data. Recovery of the first meteorites occurred within 2 days and continued for months afterward. The recovery effort included local citizens, scientists, and meteorite hunters, and featured coordination efforts by local scientific institutions. Scientific analysis of the collected meteorites revealed characteristics that were available for study only because the rapid collection of samples had minimized terrestrial contamination/alteration. This combination of factors—rapid and accurate location of the event, participation in the meteorite search by the public, and coordinated scientific investigation of recovered samples— is a model that was widely beneficial and should be emulated in future meteorite falls. The tools necessary to recreate the Sutter’s Mill recovery are available, but are currently underutilized in much of the world. <b>Weather</b> <b>radar</b> <b>networks,</b> scientific institutions with interest in meteoritics, and the interested public are available globally. Therefore, it is possible to repeat the Sutter’s Mill recovery model for future meteorite falls around the world, each for relatively little cost with a dedicated researcher.
