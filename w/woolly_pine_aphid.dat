Natural enemy complexes have been found for all three aphids, the cypress aphid, Cinara cupressi, (see report 'Cypress aphid devastation'' Spore 38 page 11), the <b>pine</b> needle <b>aphid,</b> Eulachnus rileyi, and the <b>pine</b> <b>woolly</b> <b>aphid,</b> Pineus sp. A possible biological control agent for the <b>pine</b> <b>woolly</b> <b>aphid</b> was found near CAB International's former headquarters. Because of the dramatic speed of progress and impact that the three aphids are having in Southern and Eastern Africa, IIBC has formulated a regional plan to extend research to cover another eight countries in Africa where forestry plantations are being affected {{by one or more}} of the aphids found to be causing so much damage in Malawi. The new venture, with funding from the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), covers Kenya, Tanzania Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Zaire, Zimbabwe and Zambia. The aim is to establish biological control programmes in each of the countries. The cypress aphid is becoming such a major pest in Kenya's forests that the search for likely predators has moved as far as the Rocky Mountains in America. FAO is funding a survey coordinated by IIBC and is working in conjunction with consultants at the US Department of Agriculture Forest Service. At IIBC in the UK researchers are experimenting with ways of rearm' aphids so they can be used to test the effectiveness of natural enemies. They are also working on methods of rearing the natural enemies themselves so as to be able to provide a clean, healthy population for shipment to Africa later in the year.

40|$|The Monterey <b>pine</b> <b>aphid</b> (Essigella californica) was accidentally {{introduced}} into Australia {{from the northern}} hemisphere before being detected in Canberra in 1998. Feeding on some members of Pinaceae, including the commercially important Pinus radiata, the aphid has now spread to almost all pine-growing areas and {{is considered to be}} an important forestry pest. In 2005, a project was commissioned to import the <b>pine</b> <b>aphid</b> parasitoid, Diaeretus essigellae, into Australia and subject it to host-specificity testing with a view to releasing it as a biological control for E. californica. In 2007, the first wasp pupae arrived at Australian quarantine facilities and emergent adults were used to establish an ongoing Australian culture. Sequencing of 28 S rDNA confirmed the identity of the parasitoid and showed that its closest known relative is Diaeretus leucopterus. No-choice and choice host-specificity testing was conducted using Monterey <b>pine</b> <b>aphid</b> and eight non-target aphid species as potential hosts for D. essigellae. Regardless of the testing procedure, E. californica was the only species that was successfully parasitised. This suggests that D. essigellae is highly specific (at genus or species level) and therefore, is a suitable candidate for release into pine plantations to provide control of Monterey <b>pine</b> <b>aphid</b> in Australia. Based on these data, permission to release the wasp from quarantine was granted in November 2009. Although 24 aphidiine parasitoids have been purposely or accidentally introduced to Australia, this is only the second species to have undergone host-specificity testing and in addition, is the first species released to parasitise a member of the most primitive aphid subfamily, Lachninae. This case study raises interesting questions about the basis for development/analysis of host-specificity testing of putatively highly specific biocontrol agents where close relatives of their targets either do not exist in the environment or are pests themselves.

Since its discovery, {{there were not}} much information about it.   The objectives of this research were to study <b>pine</b> <b>woolly</b> adelgids distribution, symptoms and indicators, and its scale of infestations on Pinus merkusii plantation in Java, to determine the presence of any specific P. merkusii sites invaded by <b>pine</b> <b>woolly</b> adelgids, considering the pests were native to boreal and temperate areas.   Hypothesis was <b>pine</b> <b>woolly</b> adelgids infestation on P. merkusii in Java is consistent with their native distribution.   There were 9 Forest Management Unit (KPH) with infested P. merkusii plantations which were located at altitude between 900 to 1, 700 m asl. with temperature ranging 16 - 22 ˚C and air humidity 80 - 90 %. This indicated that <b>Pine</b> <b>Woolly</b> Adelgids required low temperature to survive, which was consistent with their original distribution. Host preference with regard to scale of infestation was closely related to temperature, altitude, and number of trees per hectare.

40|$|The <b>pine</b> <b>aphid</b> Cinara pinitabulaeformis Zhang et Zhang is {{the main}} pine pest in China, it causes pine needles to produce dense dew (honeydew) {{which can lead to}} sooty mold (black {{filamentous}} saprophytic ascomycetes). Although common chemical and physical strategies are used to prevent the disease caused by C. pinitabulaeformis Zhang et Zhang, new strategies based on biological and/or genetic approaches are promising to control and eradicate the disease. However, there is no information about genomics, proteomics or transcriptomics to allow the design of new control strategies for this <b>pine</b> <b>aphid.</b> We used next generation sequencing technology to sequence the transcriptome of C. pinitabulaeformis Zhang et Zhang and built a transcriptome database. We identified 80, 259 unigenes assigned for Gene Ontology (GO) terms and information for a total of 11, 609 classified unigenes was obtained in the Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COGs). A total of 10, 806 annotated unigenes were analyzed to identify the represented biological pathways, among them 8, 845 unigenes matched with 228 KEGG pathways. In addition, our data describe propagative viruses, nutrition-related genes, detoxification related molecules, olfactory related receptors, stressed-related protein, putative insecticide resistance genes and possible insecticide targets. Moreover, this study provides valuable information about putative insecticide resistance related genes and for the design of new genetic/biological based strategies to manage and control C. pinitabulaeformis Zhang et Zhang populations...|$|R
2500|$|Aphids {{are in the}} {{superfamily}} Aphidoidea in the Sternorrhyncha {{division of}} the order Hemiptera. Late 20th-century reclassification within the Hemiptera reduced the old taxon [...] "Homoptera" [...] to two suborders: Sternorrhyncha (e.g., aphids, whiteflies, scales, psyllids, etc.) and Auchenorrhyncha (e.g., cicadas, leafhoppers, treehoppers, planthoppers, etc.) with the suborder Heteroptera containing {{a large group of}} insects known as the true bugs. Early 21st-century reclassifications substantially rearranged the families within Aphidoidea: some old families were reduced to subfamily rank (e.g., Eriosomatidae), and many old subfamilies were elevated to family rank. The most recent authoritative classifications place all extant taxa into a single large family Aphididae. Despite their names, taxonomically, the woolly conifer <b>aphids</b> like the <b>pine</b> <b>aphid,</b> the spruce aphid, and the balsam woolly aphid are not true aphids, but adelgids, and lack the cornicles of true aphids.|$|R
40|$|Studies on {{assessments}} of the air pollution and deposition caused by geothermal fields on the forest health and presence of pests have been few documented to date. In the geothermal field "Los Humeros", located between {{the borders of the}} states of Puebla and Veracruz, Mexico was realized a forest health monitoring to know the assessment could have these emissions of sulphur (S) and other two chemical elements measured by their concentrations on leaf tissues in the surrounding forests. For it were evaluated the forest healthy and pest insects registered at 20 stands of which were chosen completely at random 40 trees in total/site of the species Pinus montezumae and P. teocotein natural stands and plantations and picked up leaf tissue samples representatives per stand to determine the contents of sulphur (S), boron (B) and arsenic (As) representing each forest stand. The results of the study revealed that the presence of forest pests are not related to the proximity of the sites to emissions from stationary sources of emissions and moreover the amount of these 3 chemical substances monitored do not have none influence on the forest healthy sites condition, except for the Monterey <b>pine</b> <b>aphid</b> Essigella californica Essig, which seems to be directly associated with higher Boron content in the needles (mean= 167. 47 ± 32. 15, and peak 635. 46 ppm) and proximity of emission sources geothermal vents or where it is believed all these chemical elements are carried down by air currents to specific points and deposited in the stands. The general model obtained and with significance of R 2 = 56. 6 and P value 0. 0033 for the presence of Monterey <b>Pine</b> <b>aphid</b> and the three main pollutants released from smoke plumes in geothermal systems is [D: Essigella]= - 0. 2088 + 1. 880 E- 0. 5 (A:SO 4) + 0. 002245 (B:B) + 1. 248 (C:As).

40|$|The Monterey <b>pine</b> <b>aphid</b> (Essigella californica) was {{recently}} found in New Zealand. To examine the seasonal biology {{and impact of}} this insect on Pinus radiata, aphids were sampled using beating and branch bagging methods over two seasons (October to April), from three forest elevations, and from three tree age-classes in Hawke’s Bay forests. Many more aphids were found in 2001 – 02 than in 2000 – 01, with numbers peaking in January in 2001 and April in 2002. Few aphids were found from October to December. More aphids were recorded on trees in the medium and old age classes than in the young age class. There was no consistent pattern in aphid numbers in relation to elevation of forests. There was little visual evidence of aphid damage to trees {{but this does not}} mean that this aphid does not cause economic damage.

40|$|Forest health {{monitoring}} {{is essential to}} sustainable management of Pinus radiata D. Don plantations. Conventional survey techniques such as aerial sketch mapping are qualitative and subjective, their effectiveness depending on the skill of the surveyor. In contrast, digital remote sensing {{has the potential to}} provide quantitative and objective data on the location, extent, and severity of crown damage at a range of spatial scales. Decision tree analysis can incorporate both categorical and continuous data and is inherently non-parametric. Decision trees were used to model the crown condition of P. radiata plantations in southern New South Wales in three situations involving discoloured leaves, stunted crowns, and transparent crowns associated respectively with the Diplodia pinea (Desm.) Kickx fungus, nitrogen deficiency, and the <b>pine</b> <b>aphid</b> Essigella californica Essig. Spectral indices and fraction images derived from linear spectral mixture analyses of remote sensing scenes were used to classify crowns into either two or three condition classes. The best performing model was obtained for D. pinea with a two-class classification of crown discoloration (overall accuracy [OA] 92 %; Kappa 83 %).

40|$|The Mediterranean forest {{regions of}} Australia {{predominantly}} comprise native mallee scrub, eucalypt woodlands, exotic Pinus plantations, and commercial eucalypt plantations. Native forests have, so far, remained largely free of invasive exotic insects. The exotic pines, however, have five well-established and significant invasive pest insects: the bark beetles Ips grandicollis, Hylastes ater, and Hylurgus ligniperda (Coleoptera: Curculiondae), Monterey <b>pine</b> <b>aphid,</b> Essigella californica (Hemiptera: Aphididae), and Sirex woodwasp, Sirex noctilio (Hymenoptera: Siricidae), {{with the latter}} not yet present in Western Australia (WA). The exotic giant pine scale, Marchalina hellenica (Hemiptera: Margarodidae), was recently detected on pines in Adelaide and Melbourne and is under an eradication program. Many of the established pest species have had classical biological control programs implemented. European house borer, Hylotrupes bajulus (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), a pest of untreated softwood, is established in areas around Perth, WA, and {{has been found in}} dead and live trees, as well as untreated timber. African black beetle, Heteronychus arator (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) is a major exotic agricultural and forestry pest in wetter parts of the Mediterranean forest regions in WA, where it was first recorded in 1938. Several other exotic polyphagous horticultural pests are occasionally associated with eucalypts. Australia is the origin of major insect pests on Eucalyptus species grown in Mediterranean regions across the globe. However, populations of these insects are generally effectively controlled by native species of natural enemies in Australia. At least five species endemic to eastern Australia, Gonipterus platensis and G. sp. nov. 2, (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), Paropsisterna m-fuscum (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), Phylacteophaga froggatti (Hymenoptera: Pergidae) and Cardiapsina fiscella (Hempitera: Psyllidae), have been introduced to Mediterranean regions of WA, where they initially caused extensive and severe damage to plantations of introduced eucalypt species (predominantly E. globulus) in the region. However, the level and extent of damage gradually decreased, and it has been hypothesised that improved control by endemic natural enemies has occurred...|$|R
