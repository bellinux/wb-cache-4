25|$|Tobin <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong</b> anti-communist and anti-fascist. He {{argued that}} holding radical ideas {{was not enough}} to warrant {{expulsion}} of a union from the AFL, but supporting the Communist Party was. His anti-fascist views were given less prominence in his actions. However, he was highly critical of Father Charles Coughlin. When President Green sent an observer to a meeting of Coughlin's National Union for Social Justice, Tobin excoriated Green for doing so (and for not consulting the Executive Council first).|$|E
25|$|Ludwig's {{death was}} {{official}}ly ruled a suicide by drowning, but the official autopsy report indicated that no water {{was found in}} his lungs. Ludwig <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong</b> swimmer in his youth, the water was approximately waist-deep where his body was found, and he had not expressed suicidal feelings during the crisis. Gudden's body showed blows to {{the head and neck}} and signs of strangulation, leading to the suspicion that he was strangled, although there is no more evidence to prove this.|$|E

25|$|A Sizang, he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong,</b> {{tall and}} {{masculine}} individual who possessed an unusual body structure, measuring “9 tuuk” {{at his chest}} (54inches diameter and 108inches of the chest circumference). Yet, because {{of his ability to}} move quickly, apparent body lightness despite its massiveness, and his athletic skills, the constant admiration was overwhelming. The description of his physical feature seems similar to the figure of Goliath in the Bible, 1 Samuel 17:4-7, Goliath was more than six cubits- about three meters tall, according to the Bible. Pu Tong Seal's dwelling place was Khuasak, Zogam (Chin State), northern Burma. His father-in-law at that time lived in Theizang but owned a plot at Khuakhuan, 'Khuasak'.|$|E
25|$|There {{was only}} one mass-produced {{derivative}} of the PS1, this was the coach variant with drop-frame extension for a luggage boot. This was coded PS1/1, and <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong</b> seller, forming the major postwar fleet renewals for large UK coach firms such as Southdown Motor Services, Ribble, Wallace Arnold, Grey-Green and Barton Transport. Sales of the PS1 only ended in 1950 although it was nominally replaced by the PS2 on the home market from 1948, this gives {{an idea of the}} scale of advance orders for this coach. Many coachbuilers worldwide produced bodies on the Tiger PS, as the model was introduced at the all-time peak in demand for new buses and coaches few operators could get the body of their first choice within an acceptable time. Barton got most of its coaches fitted with Duple bodies but built its own body for its 490 (HVO729), to an American outline with shallow full-depth sliding side glazing. Wallace Arnold bought over a Leeds coachbuilder, Wilks and Meade, in 1942 to get enough bodies reserved for postwar reconstruction. Between 1946 and 1950 Wallace Arnold took 37 PS1, 11 PS2, 34 Bedford OB, 24 AEC Regals, ten Daimler CVD6 and one Guy Arab, a fairly typical sample of coach-buying preferences at the time. Southdown used six coachbuiilders on its all-Tiger coach fleet. Whilst Ribble refitted its later prewar Tiger coaches (which had previously been petrol-engined) with PS1 running units as well as taking PS1/1s.|$|E
25|$|Having won the County Championship, Middlesex {{played a}} {{representative}} team called The Rest (i.e., the Rest of England) at The Oval in a four-day match lasting from 13 to 17 September. Middlesex won by 9 wickets. The Rest <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong</b> team entirely consisting {{of players who}} had played or would play for England at Test level. In batting order, they were Cyril Washbrook, Winston Place, Dick Howorth, George Emmett, Norman Yardley (captain), Ken Cranston, Godfrey Evans (wicketkeeper), Alec Bedser, Doug Wright, Tom Goddard and Harold Butler. Middlesex won the toss and decided to bat first but were soon reduced to 8 for two as Bedser dismissed both openers Syd Brown and Jack Robertson. Bill Edrich and George Mann took the score on to 53 for three when Mann, who had scored 33, was stumped by Evans off Wright. This brought Edrich and Denis Compton together. In keeping with their form throughout the season, they amassed 426 runs between them and enabled skipper Walter Robins to declare at 543 for nine. Edrich made 180 which was just {{enough for him to}} surpass Tom Hayward's old record season aggregate, which Compton had already beaten. Compton retired hurt when he had scored 55 and the total was 191 for three. He returned with his knee strapped when the score was 274 for four and, despite his injury, he went on to make 246, his highest score of the season. Robins made 33 while Compton was off the field but the tailenders did not score many. The Rest were bowled out for 246 and followed on. They made 317 in their second innings, leaving Middlesex to win the match with 21 for one.|$|E

500|$|Guilty Men was not {{the only}} Second World War tract that damaged Chamberlain's reputation. We Were Not All Wrong, {{published}} in 1941, took a similar tack to Guilty Men, arguing that Liberal and Labour MPs, and a small number of Conservatives, had fought against Chamberlain's appeasement policies. The author, Liberal MP Geoffrey Mander, had voted against conscription in 1939. Another polemic against Conservative policies was Why Not Trust the Tories (1944, written by [...] "Gracchus", who later proved to be future Labour minister Aneurin Bevan), which castigated the Conservatives for the foreign policy decisions of Baldwin and Chamberlain. Though a few Conservatives offered their own versions of events, most notably MP Quintin Hogg in his 1945 The Left was Never Right, {{by the end of the}} war, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong</b> public belief that Chamberlain was culpable for serious diplomatic and military misjudgments that had nearly caused Britain's defeat.|$|E
500|$|An Honorary Life Member of the MCC, Gilligan {{served as}} MCC {{president}} from 1967 to 1968. During his tenure, the MCC {{was involved in}} controversy over the non-selection of Basil D'Oliveira to tour South Africa. The South African government did not want D'Oliveira in the England team {{on the grounds of}} his colour. Gilligan, in his capacity as MCC president, was aware of this having seen a private letter which communicated the explicit threat from the South African prime minister B. J. Vorster that the forthcoming tour would be cancelled if D'Oliveira were selected. However, he and the others who saw the letter, G. O. B. Allen and Billy Griffith, respectively the MCC treasurer and secretary, kept this information to themselves. When the English selectors met to choose the team, Gilligan, Allen and Griffith were present to represent the MCC. A BBC programme in 2004 claimed that Gilligan pressured the selectors to leave out D'Oliveira, but D'Oliveira's biographer Peter Oborne suggests that Allen carried far more influence at the meeting. He writes of Gilligan's part in the affair: [...] "It would be wrong to make too much of Gilligan's embarrassing past. Given that presidents are appointed for only a year, it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong</b> president indeed who could impose his personality on the permanent MCC secretariat of Griffith and Allen, and Gilligan was not a strong president." [...] Initially D'Oliveira was left out of the team, but when a player withdrew with an injury, the selectors added him as a replacement; the South African government barred D'Oliveira from taking part and the MCC cancelled the tour.|$|E

500|$|After a {{break of}} almost four months, Beholder {{returned}} in the Torrey Pines Stakes over one mile at Del Mar on September 1, {{where she was}} ridden {{for the first time}} by Gary Stevens. She started the 1–10 favorite and led all the way, winning from second-place finisher Wittgenstein. Four weeks later, Beholder was matched against older fillies and mares in the Grade I Zenyatta Stakes over eight and a half furlongs at Santa Anita. She led from the start and won, with the six-year-old veteran Authenticity in second. Mandella called the winner [...] "a filly that really likes the fight" [...] while Stevens said that [...] "I haven't gotten close to the bottom of her yet". On November 1, Beholder contested the Breeders' Cup Distaff over nine furlongs at Santa Anita. The field <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong</b> one, including Royal Delta who had won the race for the last two years, Princess of Sylmar, Authenticity, and Close Hatches. Although Beholder showed some anxiety in the starting gate, she had a clean start. Mandella had been training her so that instead of always being a front-runner, she could be [...] rated behind other horses and conserve energy. His strategy was a success as Beholder tracked the leaders before moving up into second place half a mile from the finish. She took the lead two furlongs out and went clear of the field to win by [...] lengths over Close Hatches, with Royal Delta fourth and Princess of Sylmar last of the six runners. After the race, Mandella said, [...] "I’ve been lucky enough to have many good mares in my years of training, but this mare might have to be the best of all." [...] With her Distaff win, she became the first horse to win both the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies and the Distaff in consecutive years.|$|E

Although Doughty's approach was criticised by Sutcliffe's colleagues at Pudsey Britannia, Sutcliffe himself had no regrets about the time he spent mastering the technique and later explained that swing bowling had been so well developed by bowlers in every county team that it was impossible for any batsman to keep his wicket by relying on his bat alone.
