40|$|Coastal dunes support biodiverse {{habitats}} {{of conservation}} interest and provide other essential but often overlooked benefits to society, such as carbon sequestration, {{thanks to their}} high soil carbon accumulation rates. The recently established coastal dune Natura 2000 network in the Italian Adriatic coast aims at protecting dune habitats diversity, yet its capacity to provide other ecosystem services, and the potential trade-offs with biodiversity provision have {{so far not been}} evaluated. In this paper we conduct this analysis for a key ecosystem service: carbon storage and sequestration. We i) quantify soil carbon stocks and sequestration within four coastal dune EU habitat types along the Adriatic Natura 2000 network; ii) upscale these data to create an inventory of carbon stocks for all dune Natura 2000 sites in the study area; iii) collate biodiversity data of the selected EU habitat types using plant diversity measures as surrogates of coastal dune biodiversity and iv) explore the trade-offs between carbon storage and biodiversity value for the selected habitats. Italian Adriatic coastal dune Natura 2000 sites sequester 4998 t of CO 2 e per year, with the majority in <b>wooded</b> <b>dunes.</b> <b>Wooded</b> <b>dunes</b> showed significantly higher soil carbon density than the other dune habitats, and had a much greater area, but they were characterized by lower species richness. By contrast, the endangered fixed dunes, which survive in few residual patches along the study area, showed the highest plant diversity for both total species richness and dune focal species, but had a much lower carbon density and extent. Although further analyses of additional services would be desirable for a more comprehensive assessment, these findings suggest that conservation actions should favor restoration of the natural dune zonation, since it guarantees both dune species diversity and carbon storage. The carbon stocks and EU habitat type extents produced in this study constitute the first systematic inventory for dune systems in the Mediterranean...|$|E
40|$|The germinable soil {{seed bank}} is {{described}} from a coastal barrier {{island off the}} northwest coast of Florida, USA. Soil samples collected from seven vegetation types, recently deposited dredge spoil and unvegetated areas in autumn 1990 and spring 1991 were placed out in greenhouse trays. 110 taxa germinated from the samples with the largest number (41) being C 3 perennial dicots. The largest number of taxa germinated from dry (57) and wet (54) swales, the fewest (one species: Heterotheca subaxillaris) from strand. Similarity of seed bank densities to above-ground species cover was low (Jaccard’s Index = 0. 36), not different between vegetation types, but higher in the autumn than in the following spring. Compositional gradients in the seed bank and above-ground vegetation determined using DCA ordination were highly correlated and related to distance from mean high water, and plot elevation. At the landscape scale, the seed bank provided an equally clear delineation of vegetation types to that based upon the above-ground vegetation. The seed bank of low disturbance, late-succession vegetation types (<b>wooded</b> <b>dunes,</b> swales, marshes) was well developed (high species richness, emergent density, and percentage annual species) with the exception that the large-seeded woody species (i. e. Quercus spp.) were absent from the wooded dune seed bank. By contrast, a poorly developed and transient seed bank occurred in more frequently disturbed (extensive sand movement, salt spray), early successional dredge spoil, unvegetated areas and strand. These contrasts support a general pattern of increasing seed bank development and a persistent rather than transient seed bank with decreasing disturbance frequency, increasing time since disturbance and successional maturity...|$|E

40|$|Plant {{communities}} of coastal dunes are highly biodiverse and greatly valued {{for the services}} they provide, yet they are also threatened by global change and are often neglected in conservation planning. To determine the long-term effectiveness of conservation actions on Mediterranean coastal dunes, here we focus on Italy's coastline and (i) assess how the vegetation cover of the major psammophilous habitats and species has changed since the 1960 s, (ii) identify which ecological strategies have been most successful {{in the face of}} global change and (iii) evaluate the efficacy of the protected areas network for safeguarding plant {{communities of}} coastal dunes. We compiled 2583 geo-located vegetation relevés spanning over half a century and covering the entire length of Italy's sandy coastline. Using this data base, we developed statistical models to test whether the vegetation cover of both individual species and habitats has changed over time. We then tested whether species-level changes in vegetation cover through time could be explained by species' functional traits and ecological strategy. Finally, we assessed the efficacy of current conservation measures by exploring how vegetation cover responded following the expansion of the protected areas network. Our results indicate that, where protected, plant communities have generally increased in vegetation cover in recent years. The strongest increase in cover occurred in the <b>wooded</b> <b>dune</b> habitats, where late-successional, tall-growing and large-seeded species show the clearest signs of recovery. However, this has come in part at the expense of dune grasslands, which thrive under natural disturbance and have declined since the 1960 s. The Natura 2000 network seems to have {{played a central role in}} this recovery process, as the cumulative coastal land area under protection has tripled since the network was first established. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that protected areas can play an important role in safeguarding coastal dune plant communities against land-use transformations. In this context, functional traits can be a powerful tool in guiding conservation planning, helping to identify groups of species most at risk of population declines. Nonetheless, future conservation interventions need to be mindful to ensure that the natural disturbance regime of dune ecosystems is not disrupted...|$|R
40|$|Recent archaeological {{surveys of}} {{portions}} of Fox Island County Park near Fort Wayne, Indiana, revealed {{the locations of}} 16 archaeological sites. This study was undertaken to explore the factors affecting site selection and to analyze the artifacts and investigate lithic procurement and reduction strategies as reflected by them. Further, {{an attempt was made}} to understand Fox Island's role in the prehistoric subsistence-settlement system. The sites appear to have been selected because of the environmental setting of Fox Island, a <b>wooded</b> sand <b>dune</b> complex surrounded by wet prairie and marsh with upland decidious forests within a mile. The variety of habitats concentraved a wealth of food resources within an easily exploitable area. Analysis of the artifacts from the sites revealed a primary reliance on lithic raw material from near Huntington and an occupational sequence spanning approximately 8, 000 years from the Early Archaic through historic aboriginal occupation of the area. Cultural affiliation of the Late Woodland occupation was with the southeastern Michigan Younge Tradition. Although somewhat contradictory, subsistence-settlement pattern models from surrounding areas suggested that Fox Island should have been primarily occupied during spring and summer in conjunction with the seasons of' greatest carrying capacity of the wet prairie and marsh. This was consistent with the few food remains encountered. Thesis (M. A. ...|$|R
40|$|In 2009, the staphylind fauna was {{studied in}} six {{habitats}} of the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein (northern Germany). The following habitats lagoon, sandy beach, shingle beach, primary <b>dune,</b> <b>wooded</b> cliff, and woodless cliff were significantly separated by their species composition. Vegetation and soil moisture {{were the most}} important factors separating the assemblages. Lagoons exhibited the most species-rich habitat. Sandy beaches provided the highest number of endangered species. Both sandy beaches and woodless cliffs showed the highest number of exclusive species. A loss of species was determined in the gradient from sandy to shingle beaches. Few species preferred shingle beaches; abundance of Cafius xantholoma increased with the increasing amount of shingle. More species preferred the sandy conditions, for example, Polystomota grisea, P. punctatella, and Phytosus spinifer. Anotylus insecatus and Bledius defensus require distinct mixtures of sand and silt on woodless cliffs. Tourist impact on sandy beaches accounts for approximately 50 % loss of species...|$|R
40|$|The {{growth of}} urban {{spots in the}} city of Maricá brings with it the need for studies that give us answers not only related to the causes of the {{increasing}} occupation of the area, but also the consequences and impacts of this rapid advancement. Located on the east coast of Rio de Janeiro, with a population of 119. 231 habitants, the city of Maricá characterized by harboring different environments (salt marshes, sand ridges, <b>dunes,</b> <b>wooded</b> hills, lakes, beaches, marshes), which gives the city a variety of relevant environments, and not explored yet. However, the last years have been marked by the actions of developers, government agencies, landlords and others, as agents that promoted significant changes in Maricá. This paper aims to analyze, through tools of geoprocessing and Remote Sensing, how was the urban sprawl {{in the city of}} Maricá and their dynamic changes of use and land cover. To carry out this analysis, we take as reference the years of 1975, 1990 and 2008, using census data and classification of Landsat MSS (1975) and TM (1991 and 2008). The results are presented through maps, graphs and tables that contain significant urban growth in areas not always appropriate for this, which may be important factors detonators causing impacting processes for the environment.
