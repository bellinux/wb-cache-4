40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an exploration}} of the political, economic, ecological, and semiotic dimensions of waste management in Northern America, more specifically, of <b>waste</b> <b>circulation</b> and landfilling in the Great Lakes area. It is primarily based on research conducted in and around a large landfill in the rural periphery of Detroit – which once accepted all of Toronto’s waste – and the different neighborhoods and livelihoods entangled with it. Examining landfills and the people and places associated with them, it is argued, provides a new way of understanding societies that are dependent upon mass waste disposal. I demonstrate how the prevailing Northern American waste regime creates strange new possibilities for wasted places and people even as it serves as a source of social and material pollution. All of the chapters share in common a focus on landfilling as a waste disposal method that pollutes environments, bodies, livelihoods, towns, and states, {{while at the same time}} generating new ecological relations, economic opportunities, and political movements. Some of the people discussed in my dissertation explore new opportunities through employment as a waste worker at the landfill or by scavenging there, while others seek to control or combat the waste site and see it as the product of injustice and neglect. In each case, waste seems to adhere to people and places, making them “dirty” but also inspiring dreams of future wealth, success, and power...|$|E

Several retinal dystrophies are characterized by the accumulation of lipofuscin, pigmented granular debris, in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). The first molecular component of lipofuscin to be identified is the bis-retinoid pyridinium compound A 2 E. The cytotoxicity of A 2 E mediated by blue light irradiation has been reported in the literature. A 2 E has also been observed to undergo oxidation in RPE cells. The structural characterization of A 2 E oxidation products reveals that the oxidation of A 2 E results in the formation of relatively stable furanoid oxides and very reactive aldehydes. In the present work, the antioxidant properties of glutathione (GSH) have been studied and GSH is found to inhibit A 2 E oxidation; several tentative products of this reaction are reported. Our studies also demonstrate that A 2 E derivatives rapidly react with GSH, which may cause disruption of redox status in aged RPE cells, consequently causing them to be more susceptible to oxidative stress. The accumulation of lipid-like material in Bruch's membrane (BM) is characteristic of age-related maculopathy and this lipid-like material may be related to lipofuscin. It has been hypothesized that abnormal lipid accumulation in BM blocks nutrient and <b>waste</b> <b>circulation</b> between the RPE and the choriocapillaris. In addition, there is strong evidence that this plays a role in chronic inflammation of the tissue. We have identified a nitrated form of A 2 E that is present in BM from older humans but not in RPE and only in barely detectable amounts from young BM. This is the first molecular biomarker of inflammation to be observed in BM since there is an overproduction of NO during inflammation...|$|E

Although the palm {{oil industry}} has applied biological treatment for POME, it still faces challenge of balancing the environmental protection, its economic viability and sustainable development. This experiment was carried out to examine the feasibility of POME treatment by using Nymphaea Caerulea. The sample was obtained from LCSB Oil Palm Plantation in Lepar Hilir and analysis would be conducted at University Malaysia Pahang in laboratory scale. The aquatic plant was collected from Semuji Agro Resort. The objectives of this experiment are to study the feasibility of aquatic plants in POME treatment for POME at stage 7 and to investigate treatment efficiency by using optimal design condition whereby emphasis is placed on <b>waste</b> water <b>circulation.</b> The presence of circulation in this experiment is to enhance the kinetic process, as compared to control.

From palm oil processing, {{a large amount}} of solid wastes such as palm trunks, palm fronds, empty bunches and palm shell are generated. These wastes offer problems to environment if not treated and properly dealt with. There are many ways to treat the POME. One of the alternative treatment methods was biological treatment, by using of emergent aquatic plants which was Limnocharis Flava. The research had two objectives: 1) to investigate an optimal design condition whereby emphasis was placed on <b>waste</b> water <b>circulation</b> and 2) to study the feasibility of Limnocharis Flava in Palm Oil Mill Effluents (POME) treatment system. The aquatic plant treatment method consisted of 4 plastic containers which 7 gal of each capacity and aquarium pump.

Since we must compete in the energy market against other energy sources, such as coal, we needed to be cost competitive with these other sources. Research on these competitive sources will lower their costs in the future. We need to progress in our research to remain competitive. One {{question is whether the}} current DOE program will continue to provide the level of research advances we have benefited from in the past, even though the level of funding is significantly less. I believe that the funding level is too low if we want to maintain the same technology development pace. Ignoring the funding level, the remaining question is whether the highest priority projects (by industry's definition) are the ones being worked on by DOE. There is a mix of medium-term and long-term projects in the DOE Drilling and Completion program (about 30 % short/ 70 % long). I believe that industrial research would operate with these percentages reversed, and the preference for more short-term research is manifested by questioning the appropriateness of HDR & Magma research.

The found terrain are very diversified and several occasions the vegetal covering becomes difficult in reason of the physical-chemical characteristics for germination to be inadequate. In areas of high risk to the occupation with stability problems, commonly they use covering with projected concrete for containment of hillsides, that parallelly causes strong environmental and visual impact in the intervention area, and furthermore, possibly, not consisting insolutions duly adequate or definitive for these situations. The search for alternatives is frequent in academic medium {{as much as in}} the private initiative for techniques for containment of hillsides and more economic erosion control, looking for lesser ambient impacts and better results. The search of these alternatives gradually becomes technically systemizing itself, aiming at the recovery of the conditions of dynamic balance of the impacted landscapes due to the explosive increase of social and environmental problems intrinsically related. In this direction, it will be presented the description of a work of vegetal covering by grass in plates, antierosive bioblanket and geocells in fibers of rubberized sisal for the confinement of soil in cut slopes of a highway in Brasilia/DF, in Brazil.

40|$|Dual and multi-fluidized solid {{circulation}} {{systems are}} widely used in the processes for catalyst regeneration, coal and biomass gasification, cleaning of gases, thermal cracking, drying and incineration of <b>waste.</b> The solids <b>circulation</b> systems can use external or internal circulation. The external circulation is characterized by two beds (riser and downcomer) under different fluidized conditions connected {{by means of a}} cyclone and a non-mechanical valve (e. g. fluidized bed siphon, L-valve, etc.). In the case of internal circulation system, one vessel is divided into two or several compartments by internal wall(s). The particles must be fluidized at least in one chamber and generally the fluid dynamic regimes have to be different in the chambers (for example slow fluidized bed and fast fluidized bed). The walls generally must be provided in the lower part by orifices enabling flow of solids between adjacent chambers and by an overflow or impactor for return of particles in the upper part. In a very simplified arrangement the internal circulation system (ICS) can be represented by a cylindrical vessel with a central draft tube. The circulating mass flow of solids (or mass flux) in ICS is dependent on geometrical/design arrangement, height of bed of solids, gas flow rate (aeration) in chambers and on solid particle properties. For practical and safety reasons (for example in combustion/gasification or in a sorption/regeneration process) the mixing (leakage) of one gas with another gas in the adjacent chamber should be often minimized. Unfortunately, total separation of gaseous atmospheres in an ICS is practically excluded. Our study has been concentrated on influence of geometric parameters (height of cylindrical chamber for pneumatic transport (PT), flat perforated sheet and conical gas distributor, different upper part for return of solids, total orifice cross sectional area) and operating parameters (gas flow rate in PT-column, height of fluidized bed) on circulating flow of solids.

40|$|Shipping, {{fishing and}} {{exploration}} activities in Arctic waters are endangered by ice accretion on critical structures causing various safety risks. Ulmatec Pyro {{have developed an}} anti-icing/de-icing system using <b>waste</b> heat <b>circulation</b> in a double pipe system, for hand railings, helicopter decks and stairway applications. The research objectives of this master thesis was to support Ulmatec Pyro in the design process, using theoretical models for design optimization, and to develop experimental facilities to verify their designs to meet the IMO Polar Code for ships operating in Arctic areas. The {{first part of the}} project investigated relevant literature and research on icing mechanisms and de-icing technologies. Atmospheric icing is a known problem for mobile units such as airplanes. However, marine icing is more complex since it involves saline water. Further, the marine icing process is more unpredictable with a periodic behavior caused by the weather conditions. Two different numerical models are developed, based on previous icing studies and combined with basic thermo- and fluid- dynamics. First, a simple 1 -dimensional steady state anti-icing model was developed using finite difference method (FDM) and lumped capacitance method (LCM). This model programmed in MATLAB code, is made for a given symmetrical double pipe geometry, and shows good correlations with experimental tests. The second model is made in COMSOL Multiphysics, where 2 -dimensional axisymmetric geometry is used. This model is able to handle transient as well as steady state conditions. The purpose of this model was to simulate de-icing processes. Comparing the steady state results, the CFD model and the simple 1 D model shows good correlations. The transient de-icing simulations results give good results within the assumptions that the water is entrapped in the ice. However, the de-icing experiments show that this model must be modified to give more realistic ice-melting behavior. These modifications include water draining giving insulation air layers between ice and pipe surface, and further include saline ice models. An experimental setup was designed and built for validating theoretical models, and further as a design verification lab for Ulmatec Pyro. The test lab was built inside a commercial freezing container, which turned out to have insufficient freezing capacity for the extreme Polar test conditions. Despite of these limitations, a series of experiments were conducted, providing valuable insight in the icing- and anti-icing processes. The experiments also showed that double pipes gave a more uniform surface temperature than a single pipe, and that it is favorable with a higher flow velocity in the annulus between the inner and outer pipe. The experiments confirm that the double pipe technology is giving a more uniform surface temperature along the pipe compared to a single pipe. Hence, a more efficient use of waterborne heat. The experiments also provided good validation of the theoretical simulation models within the available test conditions. De-icing tests also showed the complexity of the ice melting process. Hence, it gave {{a better understanding of the}} de-icing process and that more complex simulation models are needed. The experiments also provided valuable experience and information needed to upgrade the test rig for further testing with more extreme Polar conditions...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{determination}} of organic contaminants in wastes and {{is part of the}} multidisciplinary faculty programme 'Biological <b>waste</b> in <b>circulation</b> between urban and rural areas - biology and flow of energy and material' which started at SLU in 1994. To ensure long-term sustainability of food production it is important to recycle resources such as the nutrients and organic material in organic waste. The biodegradable fraction of source separated household waste is attractive as raw material for composting and anaerobic digestion, because the products can be used in agriculture and horticulture. Quality is an important aspect on compost and anaerobically digested organic household waste, and it is important to ensure that the products are not contaminated. As the available information on organic contaminants in the biodegradable fraction of household waste and the products thereof is limited, an important goal with this work was to increase the knowledge of organic contaminants in these material as a foundation for future studies to reduce the environmental risk from these materials. Chlorinated paraffins (CPs) were found in fresh household waste. CPs are a complex mixture of chlorinated alkanes with varying (10 - 30) carbon chain lengts and varying (30 - 70 %) unspecific chlorination. The high numbers of isomers and homologues complicates the determination of CPs. We found that multivariate analysis can be used to interpret chromatographic data of CPs and this was used to characterise the CP contamination of houshold waste. It is presently impossible to pin-point the source of CP contamination using the data available, but most probably the contamination occurs during the collection of the waste. To further improve the determination of CPs an extraction method using high diffusion liquids, pressurised liquid extraction (PLE) was developed. PLE was shown to be a suitable technique for extracting CPs from complex matrices such as fresh household waste. A source close to the collection chain is also indicated for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB). The PCB-profile found in the fresh household waste resembles that of a low chlorinated technical product. The PCB-profile expected in this type of material would originate from waste of animal origin in which the low chlorinated congeners have been degraded and the more highly chlorinated and persistent congeners dominate. Differences in the degradation rate of PCBs between composting and anaerbically degestion of the waste were also observed. A third indication of a contamination source in the collection chain is the presence of the n-alkanes in the fresh and anaerobically digested household waste, which suggest a petrogenic rather than a biogenic origin. Since the major part of the organic fraction of household waste is of plant origin, much of which is treated with pesticides, it was expected to find pesticides in the waste. Many of the pesticides were not degraded during composting or anaerobic digestion, and two that were not found in the waste were found in compost or anaerobically sludge. In these cases the organic bulk material is mineralized more rapidly than the pesticides. The anaerobic biotransformation of nonylphenol mono- and diethoxylates (NPEOI- 2) was studied in sludge, landfilled sludge and landfilled municipal solid waste. The NPEO 1 - 2 are degradation products of nonylphenol ethoxylates (heavy duty surfactants) and are further degraded to nonylphenol (NP) which is far more persistent and ecotoxic than its parental compo...|$|R
