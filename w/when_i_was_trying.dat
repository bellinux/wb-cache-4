I think that was early on in the day, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to beef up my résumé.

I probably couldn't either!" [...] In 1999, she played Alice in the romantic comedy Strange Planet and the Texan student Holly Maddux in The Hunt for the Unicorn Killer, which was based on the real life effort to capture Ira Einhorn, who was charged with Maddux's murder. In 2000, while David Lynch was expanding the rejected pilot of Mulholland Drive into a feature film, Watts starred alongside Derek Jacobi, Jack Davenport and Iain Glen in the BBC TV film The Wyvern Mystery, an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Sheridan Le Fanu that was broadcast in March of that year.|$|E
2500|$|I will {{be forever}} indebted to Dan [...] for his {{companionship}} and inspiration. Indebted, too, {{because it was}} Dan who insisted on giving my name to the Wulff Series and gave me stature I might never have had otherwise. We were fishing together on the Esopus {{in the spring of}} 1930 <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> out some new flies I'd designed in revolt to the then available Catskill patterns. The new flies had bucktail wings and tails for better floatation. I had planned to call one of them the Bucktail Coachman. It was Dan who insisted that I call them Wulffs and he started tying them under that name— Lee Wulff in the tribute in Mist on the River-Remembrances of Dan Bailey.|$|E

6000|$|... "After all," [...] he continued, [...] "what is {{life for}} but to live? It's only hypocritical to <b>try</b> and <b>be</b> a thing we are not.

6000|$|On one {{of these}} October days, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to satisfy my discontented Dora by a game at ball upon the steps, to my extreme astonishment I beheld a white pony, led by Harold, and seated on the same pony, no other than my dear little friend, unseen for four months, Viola Tracy! ...|$|E
6000|$|As {{the evenings}} were often cool, {{we sat in}} our dining-room, and the {{partition}} between this room and the kitchen {{seemed to have no}} influence whatever in arresting sound.

6000|$|... "Never {{down in his}} life, by G----d," [...] said George, {{willing to}} help his brother {{in a matter of}} horseflesh; [...] "it's only a knock he got <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to put him over the little wall beyond the lawn there; but I couldn't make the brute jump, though he's the sweetest horse in harness I ever sat behind." ...|$|E
6000|$|That simple appeal {{touched his}} better nature. [...] "I don't {{mean to be}} hard on you, Stella," [...] he answered. [...] "It is a little irritating {{to hear you say}} that you {{distrust}} the most devoted and most affectionate friend that man ever had. Why can't I love my wife, and love my friend, too? You don't know, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>trying</b> to get on with my book, how I miss the help and sympathy of Penrose. The very sound of his voice used to encourage me. Come, Stella, give me a kiss--and let us, as the children say, make it up!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "'Nobody {{asked you}} for your time, you long-eared, bob-tailed old fraud!' Cheeko said, {{swinging}} his tail in the most impudent manner imaginable, and I hopped off, determined that I'd never raise a paw in his behalf, {{no matter how much}} trouble he might be in; but, of course, when it seemed certain he'd be made over into a pie, as I'm going to tell you about, I quite forgot that he had insulted me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to do him a favor.|$|E
60|$|We set {{off again}} immediately. On {{arriving}} at the cottage, we found it shut up and apparently deserted, {{but one of the}} neighbours who knew me and who came out <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to make some one hear informed me that the two women and their husbands now lived together in another house, made of loose rough bricks, which stood on the margin of the piece of ground where the kilns were and where the long rows of bricks were drying. We lost no time in repairing to this place, which was within a few hundred yards; and as the door stood ajar, I pushed it open.|$|E
5000|$|... "I am not as {{skillful}} {{as everyone}} thinks I am; I understand {{that people are}} excited for me and what I can do which is good, as it proves that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{on the right path}} and that my hard work is paying off. However, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> really just 'normal' and not a 'star', yet. People are often asking me when 'I will go to Barcelona' and it makes me feel uncomfortable because <b>I</b> <b>am</b> still young and learning. But the rumors that run around often make me feel as if my head will explode. It puts stress on my mind <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>trying</b> to focus on River Plate and possibly get the chance to represent Colombia. It's a dream of mine to play for Colombia during a World Cup, but I cannot make it if I don't continue working hard." ...|$|R

Just to show you the way things go, just <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to swing a deal for a new hotel, I had to bust off negotiations and go and train a new crew of chambermaids at Sandsonville myself. You'd died laughing to seen me making beds and teaching those birds to clean a spittador, beggin' your pardon, but it certainly was some show, and I do, by gum! know a traveling-man likes his bed tucked in at the foot! Oh, it's fierce! The traveling public kicks if they get bum service, and the help kick if you demand any service from 'em, and the boss gets it right in the collar-button both ways from the ace." ...|$|E
60|$|Whimsical {{enough that}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to animate Scotland against the {{currency}} bill, John Gibson brought me the deed of trust, assigning my whole estate to be subscribed by me; so that I am turning patriot, and {{taking charge of}} {{the affairs of the}} country, on the very day I was proclaiming myself incapable of managing my own. What of that? The eminent politician, Quidnunc,[189] was in the same condition. Who would think of their own trumpery debts, when they are taking the support of the whole system of Scottish banking on their shoulders? Odd enough too--on this day, {{for the first time since}} the awful 17th January, we entertain at dinner--Lady Anna Maria Elliot,[190] W. Clerk, John A. Murray,[191] and Thomas Thomson,[192] as if we gave a dinner on account of my cessio fori.|$|E
6000|$|Paul said argumentatively, [...] "Now, don't go {{jumping on}} Zilla. I've been thinking; maybe she hasn't had any too easy a time. Just after I shot her--I didn't hardly mean to, {{but she got}} to {{deviling}} me so I went crazy, just for a second, and pulled out that old revolver you and I used to shoot rabbits with, and took a crack at her. Didn't hardly mean to--After that, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to stop the blood--It was terrible what it did to her shoulder, and she had beautiful skin--Maybe she won't die. I hope it won't leave her skin all scarred. But just afterward, when I was hunting through the bathroom for some cotton to stop the blood, I ran onto a little fuzzy yellow duck we hung on the tree one Christmas, and I remembered she and I'd been awfully happy then--Hell. I can't hardly believe it's me here." [...] As Babbitt's arm tightened about his shoulder, Paul sighed, [...] "I'm glad you came. But I thought maybe you'd lecture me, and when you've committed a murder, and been brought here and everything--there was a big crowd outside the apartment house, all staring, and the cops took me through it--Oh, I'm {{not going to talk}} about it any more." ...|$|E
5000|$|Other Manchester bands such as The Smiths and Oasis {{inspired}} Fray {{to write}} and form the band. [...] "Noel's the reason why I picked up the guitar <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> 11-years-old - <b>trying</b> to learn 'Wonderwall'," [...] admitted Fray.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{a rather}} famous man's idea," [...] he added, {{with a little}} dry smile. [...] "I {{had to leave the}} thing to my {{secretary}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> west.

5000|$|In his {{autobiography}} In Memory Yet Green, Asimov notes that his original {{version of the}} novel was rejected by Doubleday {{and had to be}} extensively revised before it was accepted: On the whole, Doubleday was justified, for Lucky Starr, in this particular adventure, was needlessly close-mouthed, allowing his sidekick to think he was an utter bastard, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> merely <b>trying</b> to keep things from the reader. I had to rewrite {{in such a way as}} to keep things from the reader in a subtler fashion and more in keeping with Lucky's character.|$|R
60|$|All sorts and {{conditions}} of frogs lived in that little bay. There was one inquisitive fellow, who always {{came out of the}} pads and swam as near as he could get whenever I appeared on the shore. Another would sit in his favorite spot, under a stranded log, and let me come as close as I would; but the moment I dangled the red ibis fly in front of him, he would disappear like a wink, and not show himself again. Another would follow the fly in a wild kangaroo dance over the lily pads, going round and round the canoe as if bewitched, and would do his best to climb in after the bit of color when I pulled it up slowly over the bark. He afforded me so much good fun that I could not eat him; though I always stopped to give him another dance, whenever I went fishing for other frogs just like him. Further along shore lived another, a perfect savage, so wild that I could never catch him, which strangled or drowned two big frogs in a week, to my certain knowledge. And then, one night <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to find my canoe which I had lost in the darkness, I came upon a frog migration, dozens and dozens of them, all hopping briskly in the same direction. They had left the stream, driven by some strange instinct, just like rats or squirrels, and were going through the woods to the unknown destination that beckoned them so strongly that they could not but follow.|$|E
60|$|This fact, namely, {{that the}} princely {{grandeur}} and splendor of Monaco all {{came out of}} the gaming-tables, was something that the driver of my landau made me observe, when our intimacy had mounted with our road, and we paused for the magnificent view of the sea from the headland near the museum. He was otherwise a shrewd and conversible Piedmontese who did not make me pay much above the tariff, and who had pity on my poor French after awhile, and consented to speak Italian with me. In the sort of French glare over the whole local civilization of the principality, everybody will wish to seem French, but after you break through the surface, the natives will be as comfortably and endearingly Italian as anybody in the peninsula. Among themselves they speak a Ligurian patois, but with the stranger they will use an Italian easily much better than his, and also much better than their own French. I think they prefer you in their racial parlance after you have shown some knowledge of it, and two kind women of whom I asked my way in Monte Carlo, one day <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> for the station of the funicular to Turbia, grew more volubly kind when I asked it in such Tuscan as I could command. That station is really not hard to find when once you know where it is, and at three o'clock in the afternoon I was mounting the precipitous incline of the alp on whose summit Augustus divided Italy from Gaul, and left the stupendous trophy which one sees there in ruins to-day.|$|E
60|$|I had {{the help}} of a {{beautiful}} face there which Goya had also painted: the face of Moratin, the historian of the Spanish drama whose book {{had been one of the}} consolations of exile from Spain in my Ohio village. That fine countenance rapt me far from where I stood, to the village, with its long maple-shaded summer afternoons, and its long lamp-lit winter nights <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to find my way through Moratin's history of the Spanish drama, and somehow not altogether failing, so that fragments of the fact still hang about me. I wish now I could find the way back through it, or even to it, but between me and it there are so many forgotten passes that it would be hopeless trying. I can only remember the pride and joy of finding my way alone through it, and emerging from time to time into the light that glimmered before me. I cannot at all remember whether it was before or after exploring this history that I ventured upon the trackless waste of a volume of the dramatists themselves, where I faithfully began with the earliest and came down to those of the great age when Cervantes and Calderon and Lope de Vega were writing the plays. It was either my misfortune that I read Lope and not Calderon, or that I do not recall reading Calderon at all, and know him only by a charming little play of Madrid life given ten or fifteen years ago by the pupils of the Dramatic Academy in New York. My lasting ignorance of this master was not for want of knowing how great he was, especially from Lowell, who never failed to dwell on it when the talk was of Spanish literature. The fact is I did not get much pleasure out of Lope, but I did enjoy the great tragedy of Cervantes, and such of his comedies as I found in that massive volume.|$|E
