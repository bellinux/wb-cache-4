Later that day, that's <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> out he was ill. No one knew that." [...] He added that he wished to give, [...] "all the prayer and love" [...] to the Warmbier family and had contacted them and hoped to meet with them personally.|$|E

Not only no bodies; there were also no {{suitcases}} or large bags. I did not miss a single dive. I have quite a clear impression: The aircraft was filled with garbage, but there were really no people there. Why? Usually when an aircraft crashes, even a small one... As a rule there are suitcases and bags, or at least the handles of the suitcases." ...|$|E
500|$|Best's {{popularity}} with fans {{was a source}} of friction, as many female fans considered him to be the band's best-looking member. Radio Merseyside presenter Spencer Leigh wrote a book chronicling Best's firing, suggesting that the other members, McCartney in particular, were jealous. In the 31 August 1961 issue of Bill Harry's Mersey Beat music publication in Liverpool, Bob Wooler reported on the Beatles' local musical impact and singled out Best for special praise, calling the group [...] "musically authoritative and physically magnetic, example the mean, moody magnificence of drummer Pete Best – a sort of teenage Jeff Chandler." [...] During the Teenagers' Turn showcase in Manchester, Lennon, McCartney and Harrison walked on stage to applause, but when Best walked on, the girls screamed. Afterwards, attentive females surrounded Best at the stage door, while the other members were ignored after signing a few autographs. McCartney's father, Jim McCartney, was present at the time and admonished Best: [...] "Why did you have to attract all the attention? Why didn't you call the other lads back? I think that was very selfish of you". Lennon called the accusations of jealousy a [...] "myth," [...] and claimed that Best was recruited only because they needed a drummer to go to Hamburg, saying, [...] "We were always going to dump him <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> a decent drummer." ...|$|E

500|$|In early 2008 {{during an}} {{interview}} with the Daily Mail, Lister expressed her feelings on the subject of lesbian storylines, stating: [...] "I'd definitely do a lesbian love scene in Hollyoaks. That would be a really good story." [...] It was later confirmed by Channel 4 that Lister's character would be involved in a sexual relationship with Sarah during the new late night series Hollyoaks Later. After the screening of the scenes, Lister explained: [...] "It was quite nerve-wracking actually as I'm good friends with Loui — it's quite a strange thing to smooch a really good friend so we had to get over the giggles and think 'right, just do it!'" [...] Also commenting on her worries about the scenes, she said: [...] "I thought it was hilarious! I thought it'd be interesting, though. I was obviously quite worried about them. Loui [...] and I chatted a lot <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> out {{that it was going to}} be in the late-night eps and we were wondering 'oh no, what does this mean?!' But in the end, they weren't graphic or anything like that, so it was fine." [...] She continued: [...] "It was completely mental filming them. Loui and I just had a massive attack of the giggles. I think the crew were more embarrassed than we were! We were kind of ignored for the day." ...|$|E

30|$|Welcome to {{the first}} issue of Fire Ecology, the Journal of the Association for Fire Ecology. Why another new journal? That is the same {{question}} <b>we</b> were asked <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>founded</b> the Association over four years ago, and the answer is the same. Other societies and their journals usually cover a broad spectrum of interests and topics focused in a general area such as ecology or forestry. While other journals might address fire science, its physical basis, and means to suppress it, no journal specifically deals with the ecology of fire. We feel that the science of fire ecology fills an empty niche.|$|R

Well, <b>we</b> knew this <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>founded</b> the club; but we noticed that the woman at the bottom of it was always a womanly woman. The unwomanly women who work for their living and know {{how to take care of}} {{themselves}} never give any trouble. So we simply said we wouldn't have any womanly women; and when one gets smuggled in she has to take care not to behave in a womanly way. We get on all right. (He rises.)
