50|$|In {{environmental}} policy, <b>white</b> <b>certificates</b> are documents {{certifying that}} a certain reduction of energy consumption has been attained. In most applications, the <b>white</b> <b>certificates</b> are tradable and combined with an obligation to achieve a certain target of energy savings. Under such a system, producers, suppliers or distributors of electricity, gas and oil are required to undertake energy efficiency measures for the final user {{that are consistent with}} a pre-defined percentage of their annual energy deliverance. If energy producers do not meet the mandated target for energy consumption they are required to pay a penalty. The <b>white</b> <b>certificates</b> are given to the producers whenever an amount of energy is saved whereupon the producer can use the certificate for their own target compliance or can be sold to (other) parties who cannot meet their targets. Quite analogous to the closely related concept of emissions trading, the tradability in theory guarantees that the overall energy saving is achieved at least cost, while the certificates guarantee that the overall energy saving target is achieved.|$|E

They {{can be seen as a}} means of internalizing energy-use externalities and addressing energy efficiency market failures. This paper reviews existing evaluations of experiences with <b>white</b> <b>certificate</b> obligations in Great Britain, Italy and France. Ex ante microeconomic analysis find that the obligation is best modelled as a hybrid subsidy-tax instrument, whereby energy companies subsidize energy efficiency and pass-through the subsidy cost onto energy prices. Ex post static efficiency assessments find largely positive benefit-cost balances, with national differences reflecting heterogeneity in technical potentials. Compliance involved little trading between obligated parties. Whether the cost borne by obligated parties was recovered through increased energy revenue could not be ascertained. Ex post dynamic efficiency assessments find that in addition to addressing liquidity constraints through subsidies, <b>white</b> <b>certificate</b> obligations seem to have addressed informational and organisational market failures. Confidence in these conclusions is limited by the fact that no econometric analysis was performed.

40|$|<b>White</b> <b>certificates</b> schemes mandate {{competing}} {{energy companies}} to promote energy efficiency with flexibility mechanisms, including the trading of energy savings. So far, stylized facts are lacking and outcomes are mainly country-specific. By comparing results of British, Italian and French experiences, {{we attempt to}} identify the core determinants of their performances. We show that (i) <b>white</b> <b>certificates</b> schemes are depicted in theoretical works as mandatory subsidies on energy efficiency goods recovered by an end-use energy tax, whereby <b>white</b> <b>certificates</b> exchanges are not a central feature; (ii) at current stages, existing schemes are cost-effective and economically efficient, with large discrepancies though; (iii) the hybrid subsidy-tax mechanism seems valid but conditional to cost pass through permissions; otherwise, obliged energy companies merely promote information on the “downstream” side (i. e. at the consumer level); (iv) although <b>white</b> <b>certificates</b> exchange between different types of actors involved can be important as in Italy, trade among obliged companies is negligible; instead, flexibility sustains vertical relationships between obliged parties and “upstream” partners (i. e. installers, energy service companies). In this respect, we {{support the view that}} <b>white</b> <b>certificates</b> schemes are a policy instrument of multi-functional nature (subsidisation, information, technology diffusion), whose static and dynamic efficiency depends upon the consistency between a proper definition of long-term energy savings, the appropriate cost-recovery permission and a fine coordination with other instruments. We finally propose a four stages deployment pattern, along which fragmented markets for energy efficient technologies get closer to create a unified market delivering energy efficiency as a homogeneous good. <b>White</b> <b>Certificates</b> Schemes, Static Efficiency, Dynamic Efficiency, Vertical Organisation, Policy Coordination...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} {{experiences}} gained from tradable green certificate (TGC) schemes and extract some policy lessons {{that can lead}} to a successful design of a market-based approach for energy efficiency improvement, alias tradable <b>white</b> <b>certificate</b> schemes. We use tradable green certificate schemes existing in the Netherlands and Sweden as case studies. Departing from an assessment of both TGC schemes, we identify several institutional and market aspects that have affected their performance. We conduct the analysis by addressing key evaluation criteria (i. e., cost and energy effectiveness, administrative burden, technological innovation, political feasibility, and transaction costs). It is not our intention to demonstrate to the reader a normative aspect of designing tradable <b>white</b> <b>certificate</b> schemes. Rather, we identify some key policy lessons which can be summarized as: a binding long-term target must be clearly expressed in terms of policy time frame and certainty, a proper liquid market must be ensured for tradability of certificates, the scheme should be technology neutral, transaction costs should be kept low, and the energy efficiency target should not only address ‘low hanging fruits’ but also promote innovation...|$|R

40|$|<b>White</b> <b>Certificate</b> schemes are {{currently}} being implemented or proposed in {{a growing number of}} jurisdictions as a means to drive greater energy efficiency uptake. After briefly discussing some of {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} such schemes, this paper outlines a proposed alternative approach [...] the use of Energy Sales Targets. This approach essentially involves the imposition of a cap on the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with annual energy sales and, in its simplest version, requires no tradeable certificates or permits. The proposed approach creates a clear measurable link between how compliance is enforced (the retailers' targets) and the desired outcomes of the scheme (measurable reductions in GHG emissions). This drives physical additionality of the scheme, including negation of any rebound effect within the covered sectors. It also avoids the need to define the activities eligible to create certificates, and likewise, no deeming, auditing, monitoring or verification would be required by government beyond ensuring retailer compliance [...] significantly reducing administration costs. There does not appear to be a clear precedent for this type of scheme anywhere in the world, and so this paper should be seen as a preliminary scoping of options that are deserving of more in-depth assessment.

New Directives have been formulated (e. g. the Directive on promotion of {{energy efficiency and}} energy services) and the Green Paper on energy efficiency was issued {{to act as a}} catalyst to this renewed policy uptake. The EuroWhiteCert (EWC) project, supported by the European Commission contributes to the conceptual and technical development of tradable <b>white</b> <b>certificates</b> systems covering energy savings and energy efficiency. One of the questions considered by EWC project is whether tradable <b>white</b> <b>certificates</b> will remain national management tools or may become a real European market. In this framework, the concept of a tradable white certificate system is tested by means of a pilot test which explores the practical implementation of a white certificate scheme by developing a uniform measurement and verification methodology, certifying existing projects, identifying a set of alternative market participants and analysing what could be the design of a EU-wide tradable <b>white</b> <b>certificates</b> scheme.

40|$|Recent {{years have}} {{witnessed}} regained political momentum on {{energy efficiency and}} interest in establishing markets is growing. As a result, Tradable <b>White</b> <b>Certificate</b> (TWC) schemes of differing design have been implemented in Great Britain, Italy and France. Much attention is being paid to justifying and evaluating such schemes. In this paper, we develop and apply a multi-criteria framework for evaluating TWC schemes [...] an approach that attempts to cover their individual design features. A broad evaluation is conducted regarding energy-saving and environmental effectiveness, economic efficiency, cost-effectiveness, transaction costs, political feasibility, administrative burden and technical change. The results show the design and performance of TWC schemes to be case and context-specific, and generalisations are thus inappropriate. This evaluation supports the cost-effectiveness modelled for the British scheme and the assumption that a TWC scheme is an economically efficient policy instrument. For the other, more complex TWC schemes, more data and experience are needed to judge their ex-post merit. On the whole, the proposed multi-criteria evaluation requires considerable data and complementary methods. However, the framework improves {{the understanding of the}} broad effects and attributes of TWC schemes. It deals with various empirical and normative aspects that can be applied in their evaluation.

A unified framework {{is used to}} estimate {{the costs and benefits}} of the schemes implemented in Great Britain in 2002, in Italy in 2005 and in France in 2006. 'Negawatt-hour cost' estimates reach 0. 009 /kWh saved in Great Britain and 0. 037 /kWh saved in France, which compares favourably to energy prices in those countries. Moreover, the benefits of reduced energy bills and CO  2  emissions saved exceed the costs; thus, <b>white</b> <b>certificate</b> schemes pay for themselves. Overall, the policy instrument is cost-effective and economically efficient. A closer look at the differences amongst countries provides general insights about the conceptualization of the instrument: (a) Compared to utility demand-side management, to which they are related, <b>white</b> <b>certificate</b> schemes provide more transparency about energy savings, but less transparency around costs; (b) the substantial efficiency discrepancy between the British scheme and its French counterpart can be explained by differences in technological potentials, coexisting policies and supply-side systems in these countries and (c) the nature and amount of costs influence compliance strategies.

The paper analyses, from a comparative perspective, Italy’s commitment to EU energy policies focused on creating a competitive internal energy market offering quality service at low prices, developing renewable energy sources, reducing dependence on imported fuels and implementing energy efficiency tools, safeguarding the environment. The strengths and limits of the Italian <b>White</b> <b>Certificates</b> mechanism will be examined, considering its i portance as a market-based tool in national energy policy.

40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} commitments, {{often associated}} with tradable energy efficiency certificates, dubbed "white certificates", were recently implemented in the United Kingdom and Italy and will soon start in France. Energy suppliers have to fund a given quantity of energy efficiency measures, or to buy "white certificates" from other suppliers who exceed their target. We develop a partial equilibrium model to compare <b>white</b> <b>certificates</b> to other policy instruments for energy efficiency, i. e., taxes and standards. Our conclusions are: First, if <b>white</b> <b>certificates</b> are chosen, each supplier's target should be set {{as a percentage of}} the energy they sell during the commitment period rather than in absolute terms, e. g. based on past variables. Indeed the latter solution decreases sharply energy suppliers' profit since they cannot pass the cost of certificate generation on to consumers. Such a system thus risks generating a fierce opposition from these industries. Furthermore, setting individual targets independently of the evolution of market shares seems unfair. At last, this system risks creating a large rebound effect, i. e., a large increase in energy services consumption. Second, compared to taxes and standards, <b>white</b> <b>certificates</b> (with targets in percentage of energy sold) seem particularly interesting to reach a certain level of energy savings while limiting distributional effects, thus to limit oppositions to its implementation. Furthermore, they generate less rebound effect than standards and seem more able than taxes to mobilise a part of the no regret potential. However if targets are too weak there is a real risk that <b>white</b> <b>certificates</b> systems fund mostly business-as-usual energy efficiency activities, thus having little impact while delaying the implementation of other policy instruments.
