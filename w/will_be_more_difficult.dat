When the project first began, they were missing over 300 pizmonim. The last 74 pizmonim that are still missing <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to obtain due to the aging population and the general difficulty of those specific pizmonim.|$|E
25|$|To {{the south}} of Croydon, the {{proposal}} is for the new route to diverge from the central Croydon loop and use a highway alignment, probably South End and Brighton Road, to Purley. Beyond Purley, an extension to Coulsdon will be investigated. As this would {{be close to the}} M23 motorway, a possibility would be the construction of a park and ride site. Finding a good alignment <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> south of Purley, where Brighton Road is the A23 trunk road.|$|E
25|$|Promising future {{applications}} include high-performance smart grid, {{electric power}} transmission, transformers, power storage devices, electric motors (e.g. for vehicle propulsion, as in vactrains or maglev trains), magnetic levitation devices, fault current limiters, enhancing spintronic devices with superconducting materials, and superconducting magnetic refrigeration. However, superconductivity {{is sensitive to}} moving magnetic fields so applications that use alternating current (e.g. transformers) <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to develop than those that rely upon direct current. Compared to traditional power lines superconducting transmission lines are more efficient and require {{only a fraction of}} the space, which would not only lead to a better environmental performance but could also improve public acceptance for expansion of the electric grid.|$|E

50|$|Mobile {{reception}} of some stations <b>will</b> still <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult,</b> because 18 UHF channels in the U.S. {{have been removed}} from TV service, forcing some broadcasters to stay on VHF.

500|$|To {{encourage}} exploration, the Magnum Opus can be upgraded {{with materials}} scavenged from the desert, by hijacking enemies' cars or collecting their car parts. An enemy can jump {{on top of}} the Magnum Opus to make it explode, but the player can avoid that by surrounding the car with hazards such as spikes. The player can access the garage screen throughout the game, allowing them to customize the Magnum Opus. Max's garage can change and modify the car's engine, chassis, wheels, body work, paint job, and its [...] "shell". Upgrading one aspect of the car will negatively affect other aspects; upgrading the engine will allow Max to drive faster, but handling <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult.</b> The sound produced by the engine changes when players change, add, or remove parts of the Magnum Opus. Max, his armor, and weapons are customizable; the player can unlock new skills and upgrades for him as he progresses through the game and earns experience points. Max is also customizable, with his clothing, appearance, fighting skills, and weapons being modifiable. Griffa, a wasteland wanderer, also offers Max tokens which can be used to upgrade his abilities.|$|E

Quebec (Attorney General) [...] the court was sharply divided on this point.

However, the dissenters insisted that the evidence did not show this to be actual qualities, but were rather stereotypes.|$|E

[...] Although singers may join halfway through the year during spring semester, the audition criteria <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> due to the extra work that must be done in order to catch up {{to the rest of the}} singers. [...] For non-music majors, auditions consist of singing scales, sight-reading a simple tune, rhythm exercises, and aural drills where the singer must sing back intervals that are played on a piano. [...] Music majors are tested on all those skills, and must also sing a prepared solo. The singers must re-audition every year for a spot in the Glee Club.|$|E
2500|$|The {{proposed}} reform {{met with}} opposition {{not because it}} would invite outside opinion on the university's financial and academic decisions, {{but because of the}} impression that control would be wrested from Congregation, thus threatening the university's academic reputation. Furthermore, some opponents claimed that the reform would place too much {{power in the hands of}} the vice-chancellor. Other critics questioned the applicability of corporate models of governance in educational institutions. [...] Lord Patten of Barnes has stated that without reforms to Oxford's governance it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to raise money that the university needs to advance, particularly with respect to needs-based funding to support students from poorer backgrounds. Similarly, Hood has stated that the issue is not [...] "whether there has to be change, but what kind of change." ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{observation}} {{caused a}} revolution in audio encoding. Early on bitrate was the prime and only consideration. At the time MP3 files were of the very simplest type: they used the same bit rate for the entire file: this process is known as Constant Bit Rate (CBR) encoding. Using a constant bit rate makes encoding simpler and less CPU intensive. However, {{it is also possible}} to create files where the bit rate changes throughout the file. These are known as Variable Bit Rate The bit reservoir and VBR encoding were actually part of the original MPEG-1 standard. The concept behind them is that, in any piece of audio, some sections are easier to compress, such as silence or music containing only a few tones, while others <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to compress. So, the overall quality of the file may be increased by using a lower bit rate for the less complex passages and a higher one for the more complex parts. With some advanced MP3 encoders, it is possible to specify a given quality, and the encoder will adjust the bit rate accordingly. Users that desire a particular [...] "quality setting" [...] that is transparent to their ears can use this value when encoding all of their music, and generally speaking not need to worry about performing personal listening tests on each piece of music to determine the correct bit rate.|$|E

When we get fairly there among them, we will dismount; Field and Peters will stand by the four horses, Horrocks and I will go on. If you hear a row, you will mount and wait a minute or two, and then if we do not come, you will ride off with our horses as well as your own. We shall try and make our way to the edge of the hill, and ought to be able to slip away in the darkness if we can get there before we are shot down or overtaken. However, I don't think there is much chance of our being recognized. Indeed, I expect most of them will be lying down for a sleep before the time comes for action. If there is one thing a Boer hates it is being kept awake at night. I will take one of the Kaffir boys with us.
