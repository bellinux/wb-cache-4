The mathematical model of resistance force of ferrofluid applied to armature is derived theoretically from parallel plate squeeze flow theory and ferrofluid constitutive model in which shear thickening and shear thinning effects are taken into account. Then the equivalent physical model of ferrofluid is established according to the resistance force, and, through analysis, it can be further simplified as viscous damping model. Finally, the suppressing effect introduced by ferrofluid on high frequency noises of armature assembly is verified by comparing the results of numerical simulation with ferrofluid and that without ferrofluid...|$|R

In {{view of the fact}} that the nonload area is ubiquitous in cylindrical roller bearings, there is a method for prolonging the fatigue life design by adjusting the <b>working</b> <b>clearance</b> of cylindrical roller bearings. In this article, optimization model of fatigue life of cylindrical roller bearings is developed with a quasi-dynamic method and calculated method of bearing life based on micro-area contact, considering the effect of assembly interference, temperature rise, and high-speed centrifugation. Aiming to the different geometry parameters and operating parameters of bearings, the effects of assembly interference on bearing fatigue life are discussed. The results show that the optimum fatigue life of roller bearings is achieved at negative <b>working</b> <b>clearance</b> with the loads distributed evenly within half ring. The optimum <b>working</b> <b>clearance</b> of roller bearings is not influenced by radial load. But with the increase in pitch diameter or decrease in rolling elements, the optimum assembly interference increases, and accelerating revolution of roller bearings will increase the optimum assembly interference as well...|$|E

30|$|In this paper, the {{optimization}} of geometric {{and response}} parameters of an MR damper using statistical tools coupled with FEM is presented. The geometric parameters are searched between lower and upper bounds having two/three levels {{for each of}} these parameters. The FEM models in accordance with Taguchi’s methodology based on orthogonal array (L 18 OA) are developed on ANSYS platform for the MR damper at 0.1 A. The results are statistically analyzed using ANOVA to determine the optimal geometric parameters. From the ANOVA analysis, it is concluded that the <b>working</b> <b>clearance</b> between piston and cylinder (h) parameter showed the maximum contribution for the damping force while pole length (L) and radial distance from piston rod to coil width (H) parameters are found to have intermediate contribution and the cylinder thickness (t) parameter had the least contribution for the optimization process. The optimized solution of the damper given by the optimization process is tested experimentally as well as through FEM for 95 % confidence level at 0.1 A. The results on the optimized damper conformed well to the optimal design results (as given by the DoE). It, thus, validated the proposed model of optimization of damping force for an MR damper.|$|E

The flow rate of the water and the steam entering the coolant through the break corresponded to the bubble and, in part, to the flare outflow patterns with simulation of the steam generator operating conditions. Varied patterns were used to simulate the water and steam outflow via SG tube holes of various geometries, including through a side hole, into an ejector's neck and into the <b>working</b> <b>clearance</b> of a labyrinth screw pump, with simulation of different degrees of the light phase bubble dispersion in the coolant. The lead melt temperature was 400 – 550 °C, the pressure was 0. 1 to 4. 0 kgf 2 /cm, the water temperature at the test segment inlet was 20 °C, the water pressure was 0. 2 – 8. 0 kgf 2 /cm, the flow rate of the water injected into the liquid metal coolant was 0. 5 – 200 kg/h, and the continuous steam load on the lead coolant free surface was up to 10. 0.

50|$|To get to {{the docking}} station the ship had to pass through a narrow channel {{between the two sides}} of the Million Dollar Bridge while the movable span of the bridge was raised. Operating a ship of the Julie N's size was {{considered}} especially difficult because the <b>working</b> horizontal <b>clearance</b> of the Million Dollar Bridge was only 95 ft wide, while the width of the ship was 85 ft. This only allowed room for 5 ft on either side of the tanker ship to maneuver. The official accident report cites that the ship operator directed crew members to steer to the port side (left), while he meant for the ship to be driven in the starboard direction (right). What resulted from the miscommunication between the crew of the Julie N. was that the ship drove into the right side of the Million Dollar Bridge. The impact of the tanker hitting the bridge caused a hole in the ship's hull that was more than 30 ft long. Oil instantly surged into the Fore River, with winds and ocean currents sending the oil upstream into marshes and estuaries. Over 179600 gal L of petroleum spewed from the hull of the Julie N. into the local environment.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Mechanical {{behaviour}} {{of power}} transmission systems {{have to be}} defined during preliminary design. Numerical simulations such as Finite Elements Analysis is the method used to design transmission components. This method aims to replace classical tests after experimental validation of computer software results. Sintered camshaft pulleys are designed using the same way. Design of this component can be optimised by simulating the quasi-static response of timing belt camshaft layout on a pulley under loading. The quasi-static belt response {{is related to the}} local behaviour of the transmission system while dynamic response of the whole camshaft layout is related to global behaviour. Because of the complex phenomena involved in such system and due to practical requirements of design office in terms of computer time, local and global analyses are performed separately, however, results from local analysis is used as input data for the second one. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to analyse the quasi-static behaviour of a timing belt setting on a pulley subjected to a torque. In order to take the environmental effects into account, the interaction between the belt and pulley is analysed with and without clearance. The analysis is performed using Abaqus Standard. The Finite Elements results show a significant influence of clearance on stresses distribution throughout the belt. When the belt is set up on pulley with clearance, reverse bending stresses are observed between the groove and teeth pulley, creating a polygonal effect. This effect generates a transmission error which may cause vibrations and then alter the behaviour of the belt during engine <b>working.</b> Without <b>clearance</b> between the two components, polygonal effect and transmission error are insignificant, and therefore dynamic excitations are smaller. Clearance is probably one of the major parameters governing the fatigue life of timing belt. Polygonal effect and quasi-static transmission error then constitute one of the input data for global dynamic simulations using a specific in-house...|$|R

[...] He had already begun playing golf by this time and was working in a local golf club custom repair shop. He was fascinated with how instruments were built so he began studying violin making and created parts for violins. He then applied his interest to fletching feathers on arrows and lastly he turned to designing and building golf clubs. He attended two years of college before entering the U.S. Air Force where he gained high level security <b>clearance</b> <b>working</b> in cryptography. After his service, he moved to Cincinnati and turned professional. His passion for building golf clubs reemerged as he started his first golf company in 1970. Throughout his life, Terry competed in many local and national golf tournaments. He was a long time Class A member of the PGA of America, and while working at Titleist qualified and competed in the 1999 U.S. Senior Open & the 2000, 2001 Senior British Open. McCabe was a strong advocate of manufacturing jobs in the United States, which he garnished from watching such companies as Coastcast Corp. struggle as golf companies moved manufacturing overseas in the 90's. He moved his personal master mold maker, Jose Perez, from Coastcast at the time he began working for Titleist. McCabe was a strong supporter of repealing the 17th Amendment, which would return the senate vote back to the state legislature.|$|R
40|$|Inducing {{governmental}} {{organizations to}} do the right thing is the central problem of public administration. If Congress or another principal wants a federal executive agency to pay attention to a value that constrains or conflicts with the agency’s overall mission — that additional value is here labeled, generically, 2 ̆ 2 Goodness 2 ̆ 2 — the principal often creates a subsidiary agency office — an 2 ̆ 2 Office of Goodness. 2 ̆ 2 Both policymakers and scholars should care about how and when Offices of Goodness work. Yet while Offices of Goodness are frequently established in federal agencies, they are nearly invisible in scholarship. And the resulting knowledge gap is currently particularly problematic, because President Obama has just proposed a new Office of Goodness, within the National Security Agency, to increase oversight of surveillance activities. An Office of Goodness’s success is far from guaranteed; to actually increase Goodness in its agency, its staff must skillfully use a highly constrained toolkit, and they must avoid the twin shoals of impotence or capture/assimilation. This Article analyzes the relevant dynamics. The Article begins by describing a paradigmatic Office of Goodness, the Department of Homeland Security’s Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, and the details of four controversies — information-sharing relating to the Occupy movement; laptop border searches; Border Patrol’s Spanish-language assistance for police; and data retention by the National Counterterrorism Center. These examples ground the more general discussion that follows, which is also informed by both theory and other case studies. The Article canvasses tools available to an Office of Goodness — inclusion in <b>working</b> groups; <b>clearance</b> authority; advice-giving; training and technical assistance; program review; complaint investigation; outreach; document generation; and congressional reporting. It then explains why Office influence and commitment are continually threatened, and argues that both depend crucially on external reinforcement, from Congress, the White House, non-governmental organizations, the courts, or other agencies. Office of Goodness efficacy should not be taken for granted. Unless the goal is purely cosmetic, each Office’s tools must be carefully prepared, and its influence and commitment purposefully produced and maintained. By focusing inside federal agencies and on personnel who offer advice rather than run agency operations, the Article adds to both the 2 ̆ 2 structure and process 2 ̆ 2 strand of positive political theory and research into public administration and bureaucratic theory. Its ambition is to raise the salience of the Office of Goodness strategy, placing it more prominently on the menu of 2 ̆ 2 internal separation of powers 2 ̆ 2 devices for further analysis and assessment...|$|R
40|$|For cost-beneficial reasons {{simulations}} {{with computer}} manikins have been increasingly {{used in the}} automotive industry for prediction of ergonomics problems before the product and work place exist in physical form. The main purpose of ergonomics simulations is to apply biomechanical models and data to assess the acceptability of the physical work load, e. g. <b>working</b> postures, visibility, <b>clearance</b> etc., which could result in requirements to change {{the design of the}} product. The aim is to improve ergonomics conditions in manual assembly and to promote a better product quality through improved assemblability (ease of assembly). Many studies have shown a clear correlation between assembly ergonomics and product quality and that poor assembly ergonomics result in impaired product quality and in decreased productivity. Nevertheless, there are remaining difficulties in achieving acceptance for changes of product and production solutions because of poor assembly ergonomics. A recent study in the Swedish automotive industry showed that huge savings and increased profit margins can be obtained by eliminating ergonomics risk concepts in the very early product development process. The study confirmed a strong relation between poor ergonomics assembly solutions and quality errors of the product (car). There was a substantially increased risk for quality errors and increased costs for corrective measures of the product for assembly items of high and moderate physical work load compared to assembly items of low work load. The quality risk was increased 3 and 3. 7 times, respectively. The overall cost for corrective measures in the assembly plant and for factory complete cars was 8. 7 and 8. 2 times higher for assembly items of high and medium physical work load compared to items of low physical work load. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to demonstrate the need for ergonomics simulations of potentially harmful assembly concepts in combination with cost-benefit analyses of conceivable system solutions based on calculation of costs for quality errors related to poor ergonomics and poor assemblability. The intended end result of this research is a model by application of which it is possible to calculate the cost for quality losses and health effects due to poor ergonomics and compare it with the cost for improving the ergonomics with designers, manufacturing engineers and ergonomists as main users...|$|R
