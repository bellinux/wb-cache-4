40|$|The triple-axis {{equipment}} under X-ray {{grazing incidence}} diffraction {{was applied for}} the first time in order to realise high-resolution investigations of the morphology and the strain state in a free-standing lateral nanostructure on GaAs [001]. Because the defined wires containing a thin GaInAs single quantum well (SQW) are aligned along [110] we were able to determine the wire shape and their strain profile separately running either angular or radial scans across the (2 2 0) and (2 2 0) in-plane Bragg reflection. Assuming a trapezoedric shape, the inclination of the <b>wire</b> <b>side</b> walls and the etching depth became available running rod scans at different angular positions of the grating side peaks. All these information were obtained from different depths below the surface. The thickness of the GaAs layer covering the buried SQW was determined at the weak (2 0 0) reflection. For this particular sample we determined the lateral spacing D=(320 ± 4) nm and the etching depth te=(54 ± 2) nm from reciprocal space maps within the (q[220],q[001]) plane. The <b>wire</b> <b>side</b> walls are inclined by an angle γ= 18 ° with respect to the surface.

In this project a comparisonhas been made between a laboratory offset press and a commercial press to see if the laboratoryoffset press can be used as a reliable test method or if a further development is needed. To evaluate the method, similar papers have been printed in both presses and compared using imageanalysis techniques. All together eighteen samples were tested which is enough to give comparableresults. The print quality showed a high variation, the values from the laboratory offset press and thecommercial press were not following the same trends. At present time the laboratory offset press needsome further development before it can be used as a reliable test method for halftone prints. Even sosome conclusions were made. The newsprint that has been used came from Norske Skog Tasman Mill (Kawerau), since the otheraim of this project was to do a repeatability study of their three existing paper machines to distinguishpossible differences in the production. The paper samples were taken from each paper machine on sixdifferent dates to give a representative result. This also gave the opportunity to compare the machinesbetween themselves.

40|$|A {{free-standing}} lateral nanostructure {{based on}} GaAs[001] containing a Ga 0. 97 In 0. 03 As single quantum well and similar structures after the overgrowth with GaAs and AlAs, respectively, {{have been investigated}} by high-resolution x-ray grazing incidence diffraction (GID) and conventional x-ray diffraction (HRXRD). The wire shape of the freestanding structure and the lateral density variation in the overgrown samples, were determined by running scans with constant length of the scattering vector (transverse scans) across the grating truncation rods (GTR’s) close to the (2 ¯ 20) reflection. The in-plane strain distribution became available crossing the (220) GTR’s by a scan in the longitudinal direction. Exploiting the capability of GID for depth resolution, the in-plane strain distribution was analyzed for different values of depth below the sample surface. The strain analysis was completed by HRXRD measurements close to the (004) reflection. The x-ray measurements were interpreted {{in terms of the}} distorted wave Born approximation applied for GID geometry. The strain distribution is determined by comparing the measured GTR intensities with the corresponding simulations containing the displacement fields obtained from finite-element calculations. At the freestanding wire structure we find laterally compressive strain of about Δa/a∥=− 2 × 10 − 3 at the single quantum well (SQW) with a steep strain gradient close to the <b>wire</b> <b>side</b> walls. Both overgrown samples show pronounced lateral strain variation within the overgrown layer, which still appears up to the completely planar surface. Within the SQW the in-plane strain is still compressive after GaAs overgrowth and of similar amount compared to the freestanding grating. The strain is increased by about 30 % after overgrowth with AlAs. For both overgrown samples the strain gradient near the <b>wire</b> <b>side</b> walls is reduced, but reaches a maximum close to the SQW. Accompanied by the defect passivation, these findings explain the difference in the energy shift of the photoluminescence line between freestanding and overgrown lateral nanostructures...|$|E
40|$|The dies or molds {{used for}} the {{fabrication}} of micro products usually are made of ultra-hard materials such as tungsten carbide or silicon carbide and have sophisticated three-dimensional geometries.

The ideal bead design is a high strength flexible cable with minimal cross section and covered by rubberized nylon, rayon or steel <b>wire</b> <b>side</b> wall. The basic tire bead designs are weftless bead with rubberized ribbon of parallel wires of multiple wound layers and a continuous wire wound in sufficient number of loops to give the required strength. Weftless bead failures generally occur within about 5 cm {{from the end of}} the overlapping parallel wire ribbon. The cause for this failure is generally attributed to the mounting process in which the diameter of the tire bead is changed during the mounting process in the well of the rim. A finite element model of the tire bead was developed and under the known stresses of the mounting and final use conditions. The Weftless bead generally consists of five steel wires in parallel in a continuous rubber tape or ribbons, which loosely secures the wires in a soft insulating rubber.

40|$|With {{the growth}} of the number of {{electric}} appliances which suffer from electromagnetic inference (EMI) in the frequency range 2 k – 150 kHz, the setting up of researches in this field has become more and more popular. Measuring impedances accurately in this frequency range is of great assistance for better understanding of the circuit as well as for EMI filter designs. Thus, this thesis aims to develop a safe, flexible and accurate in-situ measurement approach to measure the source and load impedances at 2 kHz – 150 kHz and then apply it to investigate the influences of the variable impedances on measurements of electrical parameters when experiencing disturbances. In this thesis, the current probe being {{one of the most important}} measurement devices is discussed first. To investigate the transfer impedance of the current probes used in the measurements a spectrum analyzer, a vector network analyzer (VNA) and a LCR meter are applied respectively. It is found that the input impedance on the <b>wire</b> <b>side</b> influences the bulk current injection (BCI) probe but not the normal current monitor probe in the transfer impedance measurements at discussed frequency range. The electric models are illustrated. Secondly, an in-situ measurement method – the three-probe method which is verified to be applicable at discussed frequency - is proposed. The measurement accuracy is guaranteed through a proper Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) process by collecting both amplitude and phase information of the measurement. In addition, the three-probe method was compared with its predecessor – the two-probe method which was proposed in 2004 to measure noise source impedance at 150 k – 30 MHz. Then the impedances measurement results of different sources and loads are illustrated by using this three-probe method. At last, by using a variable inductance/capacitance box to simulate different source conditions, it comes out that the loads which property will turn out to be capacitive at certain frequency (2 k – 150 kHz) are sensitive for source impedance variations. Their voltages and currents all are influenced significantly with the resonance between source and load impedances. Fortunately, with further investigation, this effect seems not to interfere with the reading of the smart meter under the test.

40|$|The {{resistivity}} of metallic {{thin films}} and nanowires increases drastically {{when the film}} thickness or wire diameter is reduced. Correspondingly, electrical currents through these structures suffer from e. g. increased heating, power dissipation and transmission delay, all being undesirable effects for the typical nano-scaled conductor applications such as interconnects in semiconductor devices. Several experiments {{have shown that the}} resistivity increase is caused by an increase of electron scattering at grain boundaries and boundary surfaces of the structures, but the availability of solid resistivity scaling models for sub- 10 nm nanostructures is rather limited. In order to assess the performance of metallic thin films and nanowires for conductor applications in this regime, we study the electron transport and resistivity scaling properties with the semi-classical multi-subband Boltzmann transport equation. The material band structure and quantum mechanical effects of scattering and confinement of the electrons are taken into account and unlike the conventional Fuchs-Sondheimer and Mayadas-Shatzkes models, phenomenological fitting parameters are not required. Instead, the statistical grain, surface and barrier properties, such as the grain density or the surface roughness correlation length, enter the model through scattering rates based on Fermi's golden rule and a generalized ensemble averaging procedure. With an analytical expression for the solution of the Boltzmann equation and the scattering rates, we are able to perform fast and accurate transport simulations. Furthermore, the validity of the considered perturbative semi-classical approach is investigated by looking at the higher-order corrections of Fermi’s golden rule and a derivation of the self-consistent relaxation time solution of the Boltzmann equation from quantum mechanical linear response theory is presented. Transport properties are obtained for thin films, nanowires and graphene nanoribbons, a promising alternative for future nano-scaled conductors, with realistic parameters for the relevant scattering sources of each nanostructure. While the resistivity scaling of thin films is well described with the conventional resistivity scaling models, our approach shows deviant behavior for nanowires and graphene nanoribbons. This is caused by confinement, leading to quantized electron state wave vectors along the transport direction with possible suppression of surface roughness scattering. The effect offers a window of opportunity to reduce resistivity scaling, {{but it is hard to}} exploit for nanowires with large conduction electron densities as extreme fine-tuning of the average <b>wire</b> <b>side</b> lengths is required. For grain boundary scattering, the general rule for optimal resistivity scaling remains maximizing the average grain size. Graphene nanoribbons do not suffer from grain boundaries and the suppression of edge roughness scattering is quite robust against width variations, but the carrier density is typically much lower and substantial doping adds additional scattering sources in the form of charged dopants. status: publishe...|$|E

In this paper, we investigate the integration of RSVP and a RSVP-like flow reservation scheme in wireless LANs, as an end-to-end solution for QoS guarantee in wired-cum-wireless networks. We propose WRESV, an RSVP-like flow reservation and admission control scheme for IEEE 802. 11 wireless LAN. Using WRESV, wired/wireless in-tegration can be easily implemented by cross-layer in-teraction at the Access Point.

40|$|Wireless side {{monitoring}} employing distributed sniffers {{has been}} shown to complement <b>wired</b> <b>side</b> monitoring using Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and base station logs, since it reveals detailed PHY and MAC behaviors, as well as timing information. Due to hardware limitations, wireless sniffers typically can only collect information on one channel at a time. Distributed algorithms are desirable to determine the optimal channel allocation of sniffer nodes to maximize the information collected. In this paper, we propose Gibbs sampler based algorithms for robust distributed monitoring of multi-channel wireless networks. Among several variants of the base Gibbs sampling approach, we find that most algorithms suffer from high sensitivity to parameter selection. In contrast, Gibbs sampling using a thermodynamic schedule is self-tuned and can adapt to different network configurations. Simulation studies show that the proposed algorithms can achieve faster convergence rate and have higher chance of reaching global optima than traditional Gibbs sampler algorithm.
