He established a <b>winding</b> <b>path,</b> known as Capability Brown path, through the park and planted deciduous trees in key places to frame the house and castle. The deer park contains notable herds of rare White Park cattle and fallow deer. A small garden behind the house, overlooking the deer park, Moorish in style with a central fountain, has been restored to its former glory. Brown's beech clumps survive in the present day.|$|E

2500|$|Each {{panel is}} framed by an arch or doorway {{and seems to}} be {{positioned}} within church portals, in interior spaces that give the appearance of taking place on a stage. [...] The front of each frame contains the facing of a step, which, according to art historian Jeffrey Chipps Smith, implies [...] "the viewer's proximity to, and potential for imaginatively entering into, the divine stage." [...] In contrast to most triptychs of the time, the panels were originally fixed and not hinged, although they were later broken apart and reassembled as movable. Each is remarkably free of the pictorial traditions generally used when depicting these episodes. The Holy Family panel shows none of the other figures usually represented in pictures of the birth or infancy of Christ.

40|$|In {{an urban}} {{planning}} context, an assessment indicator for evaluating a city's dispersion potential is beneficial, {{especially if the}} city has a complex natural terrain and significant wind variations. A {{study was conducted to}} implement an urban canopy drag indicator, taking site wind variation into account by involving both wind speed and direction in the calculations. Hong Kong (HK) was taken as an example due to its complicated natural topography and wind characteristics. A spatial distribution of an urban canopy drag over HK was determined based on wind data from 2004. The urban canopy drag values in three highly urbanized areas in HK, including Kowloon West, Kowloon East and Hong Kong Island North, were obtained and are discussed in detail. A fluid particle tracking program was developed and applied to identify the major <b>wind</b> <b>paths</b> in Kowloon West, with an area of approximately 5. 5 × 6 km as an example. We analyzed the diurnal variation in the dispersion times and the major <b>wind</b> <b>paths</b> in the region during both summer and winter. Our results estimated that the horizontal dispersion times of Kowloon West during both winter and summer were approximately 20 min. By combining the <b>wind</b> <b>paths</b> from both seasons, we identified several major <b>wind</b> <b>paths</b> and critical ventilation areas in Kowloon West.
