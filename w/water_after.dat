Two tablespoons is around the equivalent of the juice of one lemon. The product has a shelf life of six months.|$|E
5|$|Male Scyllarus latus carry spermatophores at {{the base}} of the last two pairs of pereiopods in April. Fertilisation has not been {{observed}} in this species, but most reptant decapods mate with the ventral surfaces together. Between July and August, females carry around 100,000 eggs on their enlarged, feathery pleopods. The eggs develop from being a bright orange colour to a dark brown before being shed into the <b>water</b> <b>after</b> around 16 days of development. There is normally only one generation per year.|$|E
5|$|The Gila monster {{is found}} in the Southwestern United States and Mexico, a range {{including}} Sonora, Arizona, parts of California, Nevada, Utah, and New Mexico (potentially including Baja California). They inhabit scrubland, succulent desert, and oak woodland, seeking shelter in burrows, thickets, and under rocks in locations with ready access to moisture. In fact, Gila monsters seem to like water and can be observed immersing themselves in puddles of <b>water</b> <b>after</b> a summer rain. They avoid living in open areas such as flats and farmland.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{other members}} of this phylum, {{anthozoans}} {{do not have a}} medusa stage in their development. Instead, they release sperm and eggs into the <b>water.</b> <b>After</b> fertilisation, the planula larvae form part of the plankton. When fully developed, the larvae settle on the seabed and attach to the substrate, undergoing metamorphosis into polyps. Some anthozoans can also reproduce asexually through budding or by breaking in pieces. More than 6,100 species have been described.|$|E
5|$|A {{weather station}} in Norfolk, Virginia {{recorded}} gusts of 3844mph (6171km/h) and 0.17inches (4.31mm) of rainfall. In Cape Henry, sustained winds of 42mph (68km/h) and a precipitation total of 0.02inches (0.5mm) were reported. Coastal sections of southeastern Virginia experienced tides 2.26.1feet (0.61.8m) above normal, resulting in minor tidal flooding. One indirect fatality was attributed from Gladys {{when a man}} suffered fatal wounds to his throat due to flying debris. High winds and strong ocean currents from Gladys produced beach erosion in New Jersey, New York and Massachusetts. In Rhode Island, the outer bands of Gladys produced light rainfall, peaking at 0.38inches (9.6mm). A boy was washed into the sea by the waves offshore Narragansett and was rescued by United States Coast Guard servicemen, who dove into the <b>water</b> <b>after</b> two previous attempts to rescue him failed.|$|E
5|$|After peak intensity, Chapala {{skirted the}} Yemeni island of Socotra on 1November. Drier air and {{increased}} wind shear weakened the cyclone, although it maintained {{much of its}} intensity upon entering the Gulf of Aden on 2November, becoming the strongest known cyclone in that body of <b>water.</b> <b>After</b> bypassing northern Somalia, Chapala weakened further {{and turned to the}} west-northwest. Early on 3November, the storm made landfall near Mukalla, Yemen, as a very severe cyclonic storm, making it the strongest storm on record to strike the nation. The storm dissipated the next day.|$|E

5|$|Bardia did {{not become}} an {{important}} port as supply by sea continued to run through Sollum but became {{an important source of}} <b>water,</b> <b>after</b> the repair of the large pumping station that the Italians had installed to serve the township and Fort Capuzzo. Axis forces reoccupied the town in April 1941, during Operation Sonnenblume Rommel's first offensive in Cyrenaica. Further fighting occurred from 31 December 1941 – 2 January 1942, before Bardia was re-taken by the 2nd South African Division. Bardia changed hands again in June 1942, being occupied by Axis forces for a third time and was re-taken for the last time in November unopposed, following the Allied victory at the Second Battle of El Alamein.|$|E
5|$|By a {{day after}} the storm made landfall, the record power outages were largely restored. However, salt damage {{prevented}} restoration in some areas for several days. The outages left residents temporarily without <b>water</b> <b>after</b> water pumps were shut down. In Hiroshima, lack of power caused traffic congestion, shut down banks, and disrupted hospitals. The widespread power outages related to Mireille prompted the government to reconstruct transmission towers with anemometer, or wind measurement devices. Following the storm, insurance companies paid $6billion to policy holders in Japan, which was a world record related to wind damage; this was surpassed {{less than a year later}} by Hurricane Andrew striking Florida. The typhoon still holds the title as the costliest non-Atlantic hurricane.|$|E

5|$|By {{that year}} the bikini made up nearly 20% of {{swimsuit}} sales, {{more than any}} other model in the US. As skin cancer awareness grew and a simpler aesthetic defined fashion in the 1990s, sales of the skimpy bikini decreased dramatically. The new swimwear code was epitomized by surf star Malia Jones, who appeared on the June 1997 cover of Shape Magazine wearing a halter top two-piece for rough <b>water.</b> <b>After</b> the 90s, however, the bikini came back again. US market research company NPD Group reported that sales of two-piece swimsuits nationwide jumped 80% in two years. On one hand the one-piece made a big comeback in the 1980s and early 1990s, on the other bikinis became briefer with the string bikini in the 1970s and 80s.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Graham of the 2002–03 Australian region cyclone {{season was}} a weak {{tropical}} storm that affected Australia during late February and early March 2003. Graham originated {{from an area}} of convection that emerged onto <b>water</b> <b>after</b> sitting over Australia on 23 February. The interaction with a monsoon trough formed an {{area of low pressure}} that developed into Tropical Cyclone Graham on 27 February. The storm moved slowly to the east-southeast, and after turning to the south it peaked as a tropical storm and made landfall on Western Australia the next day. The cyclone weakened as it moved inland, and dissipated on 1 March. The storm dropped heavy rainfall and caused high winds, which produced flooding and downed trees. One fatality occurred, though no significant damages were reported.|$|E

He stated that his Department did not intend to amend the relevant Air Navigation Order to require pilots of four-engine aeroplanes to perform the periodic checks in a four-engine aeroplane because it considered it was more challenging to fly with one engine inoperative in a two-engine aeroplane than in a four-engine aeroplane.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, Erie started {{building}} a waterworks on Presque Isle to provide fresh {{water for the}} city. Water from Lake Erie was pumped into two reservoirs on the peninsula, where particulates in the water were allowed to settle, removing them from the lake <b>water.</b> <b>After</b> treatment, the water flowed into the waterlines of the city. In 1917 a pumphouse powered by a steam boiler and engine was built: this pumped the water from one basin into the other, then across Presque Isle Bay to Erie. This system of supplying drinking water for Erie operated until 1949. The pumphouse is now used for zebra mussel control and as a concession stand for bicycle and quadracycle-rentals within the state park.|$|E
5|$|In {{testing the}} {{transmitter}} proved only barely suitable in the air-to-air role, with short detection ranges {{due to its}} relatively low power. But to everyone's surprise, {{it was able to}} easily pick out the wharves and cranes at the Harwich docks a few miles south of Bawdsey. Shipping appeared as well, but the team was unable to test this very well as the Heyford was forbidden to fly over <b>water.</b> <b>After</b> this success, Bowen was granted two Avro Anson patrol aircraft, K6260 and K8758, along with five pilots stationed at Martlesham to test this ship-detection role. Early tests demonstrated a problem with noise from the ignition system interfering with the receiver, but this was soon resolved by fitters at the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE).|$|E
