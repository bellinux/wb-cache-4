Ramgir Bua, a devotee, testified that Sai Baba was dressed like an athlete and sported 'long hair flowing down {{to the end of}} his spine' when he arrived in Shirdi, and that he never had his head shaved. It was only after Baba forfeited a wrestling match with one Mohiddin Tamboli that he took up the kafni and cloth cap, articles of typical Sufi clothing.

25|$|In 1911, the Imperial Household Ordinance on Imperial Family Dress was promulgated, and an {{additional}} clause in it abolished the pertinent Dajō-kan edicts of 1873 and 1876. This order defined two levels of formal dress, changed the chrysanthemum foliage scrollwork to use a sakura motif instead, and specified fully closed mandarin collars. However, as Imperial Family members were now supposed to wear the uniforms of their offices if they held any, and most princes were appointed as officers in the military or navy unless there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> not to, most wore military uniforms, and these new uniforms for the Imperial Family saw little actual use.|$|E
25|$|The {{novel was}} {{received}} well by young Austrians in the 1980s. To them, the book represented {{a story of}} truth that was long hidden. At a time when Austria was starting to take on responsibility for its nonaction during World War II, February Shadows threw light on problems of the past. Reichart displayed to her own nation that ignoring and forgetting {{events such as the}} Mühlviertler Hasenjagd was unacceptable and not to be tolerated. Some older Austrians, who had lived through the war, considered February Shadows controversial and inappropriate. Much like the character Hilde, they felt the past should stay in the past, that there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> for Austrian silence about the events of World War II: to protect lives.|$|E

500|$|Luton manager Ray Harford {{had doubts}} over his team {{selection}} for the final. Though {{buoyed by the}} return of David Preece and Ricky Hill to full training, he was without Darron McDonough who injured his knee ligaments in training. Harford said the instability presented a selection dilemma, telling reporters: [...] "I think I have got to break somebody's heart by telling him he is not playing." [...] He admitted Luton's poor run of form since losing the Full Members Cup <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> why he would make changes for the Wembley final, and noted his side's difficulty on grass away from home. Harford identified David Rocastle as Arsenal's biggest threat and felt they had few weaknesses in the side other than the ability to finish chances. He believed O'Leary absence through injury was a big loss for Arsenal, and implied that Williams was needed in midfield: [...] "Without him they don't have a leader.

500|$|Manga critic Jason Thompson {{declared}} Toriyama's art influential, {{saying that}} his [...] "extremely personal and recognizable style" [...] <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> for Dragon Balls popularity. He {{points out that the}} popular shōnen manga of the late 1980s and early 1990s had [...] "manly" [...] heroes, such as City Hunter and Fist of the North Star, whereas Dragon Ball starred the cartoonish and small Goku, thus starting a trend that Thompson says continues to this day. Toriyama himself said he went against the normal convention that the strongest characters should be the largest in terms of physical size, designing many of the series' most powerful characters with small statures. Thompson concluded his analysis by saying that only Akira Toriyama drew like this at the time and that Dragon Ball is [...] "an action manga drawn by a gag manga artist." [...] However, James S. Yadao, author of The Rough Guide to Manga, points out that an art shift does occur in the series, as the characters gradually [...] "lose the rounded, innocent look that [...] established in Dr. Slump and gain sharper angles that leap off the page with their energy and intensity." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1965, heavy {{flooding}} {{caused by}} Hurricane Betsy brought concerns regarding flooding from hurricanes to the forefront. That year Congress passed the Flood Control Act of 1965 which, among other issues, gave authority for {{design and construction}} of the flood protection in the New Orleans metropolitan area to the United States Army Corps of Engineers, subject to cost sharing principles, {{some of which were}} waived by later legislation. [...] The local municipalities were charged with maintenance once the projects were completed. After 1965, the corps built a levee system around a much larger geographic footprint that included previous marshland and swamp. Many new subdivisions were developed to cater to those who preferred a more suburban lifestyle but were open to remaining within the city limits of New Orleans. Historians question why the area farthest east was developed, since it was viable wetlands and because ringing this region with levees did nothing significant toward protecting the city. What expansion accomplished was {{to increase the amount of}} land that could be developed, and it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> for the Army Corps to expand the size of its project. In addition the structures caused subsidence of up to [...] in some areas due to the consolidation of the underlying organic soils.|$|E
500|$|With {{much of the}} {{criticism}} placed on the club during his first year, the scrutiny turned to Watts {{during the next few}} seasons as it was deemed that he was not living up to his potential or the public's expectations. This was partly due to Watts displaying a lack of urgency and work-rate on the field according to former players Wayne Carey, Garry Lyon and coach Mick Malthouse. He played the early parts of his career in different positions, which Garry Lyon wrote led to an instability in his game and <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> for why he, at times, lacked confidence and self-belief in his abilities. He was often very quickly scrutinised when he played poorly, and was the first to player to be blamed when the team played a bad match, which led to Paul Roos questioning why the public had such a fixation with Watts' form. He was also plagued with being known as the [...] "great white hope" [...] {{as soon as he was}} drafted and due to the club trailing near the bottom of the ladder from 2009 to 2015 and experiencing failed rebuilds, Watts was symbolically seen as a poster boy for Melbourne's failures during this period.|$|E
50|$|According to Thomas Nagel, consequentialism {{need not}} be too {{demanding}} since {{it is possible to}} distinguish between 'agent-neutral' reasons and 'agent-relative' reasons.

An agent-relative <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> that applies only to particular individuals: thus, not everybody has <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> to want me to study every day, however, I have <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> to want to study every day, namely, because I want to pass my exams.|$|R
40|$|An action's {{illegality}} can <b>be</b> {{irrelevant to}} <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> not to perform it. A plausible example of <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> not to assault is that assault causes suffering. Since assault is illegal, the <b>reason</b> pertains to <b>a</b> legally proscribed action. Still, assault's illegality is irrelevant in this case: the reason would pertain (assault would cause suffering; {{we would have}} reason not to assault) even if assault were not legally proscribed. On the other hand, it appears that <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> can <b>be</b> one that derives from the interposition of law. This thesis is about reasons of this second type (legal reasons). In particular, it is about their formal features. For example, it is about their individuating conditions (when are p and q two legal reasons rather than one?) and about how legal reasons can be second-order rather than first-order (what follows when p <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> not to have another reason figure in deliberation about action?). Most particularly, however, it is about their identity conditions (if p <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason,</b> when and only when <b>is</b> p <b>a</b> legal <b>reason?).</b> I argue against three widely-accepted claims {{about the nature of}} legal reasons: (i) p <b>is</b> <b>a</b> legal <b>reason</b> only if p <b>is</b> <b>a</b> content-independent <b>reason</b> (chapters 5 and 6); (ii) if p <b>is</b> <b>a</b> legal <b>reason</b> to ¢, p could <b>be</b> <b>a</b> complete <b>reason</b> to ¢ or a part of <b>a</b> complete <b>reason</b> to ¢ (chapters 2, 3 and 4); (iii) <b>a</b> legal <b>reason</b> p has <b>a</b> significant formal feature when p <b>is</b> <b>an</b> exclusionary <b>reason</b> (chapter 8). I also argue that one argument to the conclusion that analytical jurisprudence must pay special to attention moral legal <b>reasons</b> - <b>an</b> argument seen in recent work by R. <b>A.</b> Duff - <b>is</b> unconvincing (chapter 7) ...|$|R
