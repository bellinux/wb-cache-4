Do Monitors Monitor? <b>Write-offs</b> and Corporate Governance This paper examines the relation between corporate governance and CEO turnover and the decision to take <b>write-offs.</b> Companies with poor monitoring mechanisms take <b>write-offs</b> due to endogenous factors. Conversely, companies with strong monitoring mechanisms take <b>write-offs</b> because of exogenous factors, like negative industry shocks. These ”good <b>write-offs</b> ” lead to an increase in earnings transparency and result in positive announcement effects, as well as <b>Write-offs</b> have become increasingly common in the past two decades.

40|$|Building on agency theory, {{this article}} investigates whether family firms’ {{accounting}} behavior regarding long-lived asset <b>write-offs</b> {{differs from that}} of nonfamily firms. We provide evidence that nonfamily firms use <b>write-offs</b> for earnings management purposes, while family firms report <b>write-offs</b> coherent with the firm performance. Family firms experience dwindling sales and lower profitability in the years following the <b>write-offs,</b> consistently with an effective decline in their assets value. The findings are consistent with reduced owner-manager agency conflicts in family firms. We find no indication of family entrenchment, which is consistent with family owners being concerned with the reputational damage associated with a loss of a firm’s asset value...|$|R
5|$|Andersen's {{auditors}} were {{pressured by}} Enron's management to defer recognizing the charges {{from the special}} purpose entities as its credit risks became known. Since the entities would never return a profit, accounting guidelines required that Enron should take a <b>write-off,</b> where {{the value of the}} entity was removed from the balance sheet at a loss. To pressure Andersen into meeting Enron's earnings expectations, Enron would occasionally allow accounting companies Ernst & Young or PricewaterhouseCoopers to complete accounting tasks to create the illusion of hiring a new company to replace Andersen. Although Andersen was equipped with internal controls to protect against conflicted incentives of local partners, it failed to prevent conflict of interest. In one case, Andersen's Houston office, which performed the Enron audit, was able to overrule any critical reviews of Enron's accounting decisions by Andersen's Chicago partner. In addition, after news of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigations of Enron were made public, Andersen would later shred several tons of relevant documents and delete nearly 30,000 e-mails and computer files, causing accusations of a cover-up.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} the links between implementing ISA 540 and mitigating the practice of smoothing reported net earnings using <b>write-offs</b> of accounts receivable and inventory by reporting entities in Poland. The research question stems from the previous analysis carried out by the author in which evidence was provided that reporting entities in Poland in the period 2000 – 2010 effectively used <b>write-offs</b> of accounts receivable and inventory in order to mitigate fluctuations of reported net earnings. This paper provides evidence that before implementing ISA 540 reporting entities used <b>write-offs</b> of receivables and inventory for income smoothing in effective manner, however in the period after implementing the standard (2009 – 2014) no link was observed between the <b>write-offs</b> and reduced fluctuations of reported net earnings. The research has been carried out using Wilcoxon signed-rank test used to check equality of medians of mean deviations of net earnings before <b>write-offs</b> of receivables and inventory and mean deviations of net earnings after <b>write-offs.</b> For the period before implementing ISA 540 there are grounds to reject the hypothesis of equality of medians of mean deviations of net earnings, however in the post-adoption period there is no justification to reject the hypothesis of equality of medians. The research provides evidence of positive impact of ISA 540 mitigating the processes of accounting earnings management. The indicated regularity does not apply to banks, because within this group of companies we have not observed the use of <b>write-offs</b> of loan receivables {{in order to reduce the}} variability of net earnings before implementing ISA 540 and in the period following the implementation of the standard...|$|R

The aim is to show that earnings are conditionally conservative and the firm's governance (measured as CEO-chairman duality) is associated with the level of conditional conservatism. In addition, I will test whether bad news increase the probability of goodwill <b>write-offs</b> and if the firm's governance is associated with the timeliness of goodwill <b>write-offs.</b> In the background there is the standard SFAS 142 which eliminated the annual amortization of goodwill and presented the annual impairment test required for goodwill. It has been criticized that this has increased managers' ability to manipulate earnings due to the unverifiable fair-values. Conservative financial reporting works as a governance mechanism and prevents potential earnings manipulation by the managers.
