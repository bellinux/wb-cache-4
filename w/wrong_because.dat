5|$|Grimaldi and Engel, {{reviewing}} the phylogeny in 2005, commented that many cladistic studies {{had been made}} with no stability in Ephemeroptera suborders and infraorders; the traditional division into Schistonota and Pannota was <b>wrong</b> <b>because</b> Pannota {{is derived from the}} Schistonota.|$|E
5|$|Dewi Zephaniah Phillips defended Wittgenstein's theory {{by arguing}} that {{although}} religious language games are autonomous, {{they should not be}} treated as isolated because they make statements about secular events such as birth and death. Phillips argued that because of this connection, religions can still be criticised based on human experiences of these secular events. He maintained that religion cannot be denounced as <b>wrong</b> <b>because</b> it is not empirical.|$|E
5|$|Because Kant viewed {{rationality}} as {{the basis}} for being a moral patient—one due moral consideration—he believed that animals have no moral rights. Animals, according to Kant, are not rational, thus one cannot behave immorally towards them. Although he did not believe we have any duties towards animals, Kant did believe being cruel to them was <b>wrong</b> <b>because</b> our behaviour might influence our attitudes toward human beings: if we become accustomed to harming animals, then we are more likely to see harming humans as acceptable.|$|E
60|$|And they showed, I am afraid, {{that very}} evening that their hearts were hardened. For {{out of a}} sort of spite and stubbornness they took a delight in doing what was <b>wrong,</b> just <b>because</b> they {{had been told that}} it was <b>wrong,</b> and <b>because</b> they were {{determined}} to show {{that they would not be}} frightened or turned from what they chose.|$|R

5000|$|On January 6, Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise of Cincinnati, {{leader of}} the Reform movement, led a {{delegation}} that met with Lincoln to express gratitude for his support. Lincoln said he was surprised that Grant had issued such a command and said, [...] "to condemn a class is, to say the least, to wrong the good with the bad." [...] Lincoln said he drew no distinction between Jew and Gentile and would allow no American to be <b>wronged</b> <b>because</b> of his religious affiliation.|$|R
25|$|Theft is <b>wrong</b> <b>because</b> it destroys social relations, and man is {{by nature}} a social animal (i.e., {{does not support}} the {{subsidiary}} precept of living in society).|$|E
25|$|Drunkenness is <b>wrong</b> <b>because</b> it injures one's health, and worse, destroys one's {{ability to}} reason, which is {{fundamental}} to man as a rational animal (i.e., does not support self-preservation).|$|E
25|$|During {{refurbishment}} work in 1626, a niche {{was found}} with two coffins that supposedly contained the remains of Leonor and her son. A plaque was later placed, dated 1384, which identifies the place as the burial of both. The date is <b>wrong</b> <b>because</b> Leonor's date of death is unknown, although {{it had to be}} between 1390 —when King John I of Castile included her in the expenses of his household— and 1406 —when his son King Henry III executed his last will mentioning his stepmother Beatrice, but not her mother Leonor.|$|E

However, this article is obviously <b>wrong</b> <b>because</b> Bak stayed in Japan from 1397 to 1399 as an envoy to the Ōuchi family of western Japan but could never be there in 1401. Japanese scholar Miya Noriko considers that the date was intentionally altered for political reasons (see below).|$|E
25|$|Both {{the date}} and the {{circumstances}} of Raymond's release are uncertain. According to William of Tyre, Raymond was set free after spending eight (solar) years in captivity, but Ibn Jubayr stated that Raymond had been held in prison for twelve (lunar) years. Ali ibn al-Athir recorded that Raymond was released after Nur ad-Din died on 15 May 1174, but he was obviously <b>wrong,</b> <b>because</b> Raymond had witnessed a royal charter in Jerusalem already on 18 April 1174. On the other hand, according to Lewis, Ali ibn al-Athir may have been right when claiming that Raymond was released because of the emerging conflict between Nur ad-Din's family and his ambitious commander, Saladin.|$|E
25|$|In the sub plot, Roderick's rape of Florinda {{leads to}} Count Julian, her father, turning against Roderick and aiding the Moors. However, Florinda feels that she {{possibly}} misled Roderick and caused the incident. She confesses these feelings to Roderick who {{at that time}} was using the disguise of Father Maccabee. In her confession, she admits that they kissed and promised to meet again because she was passionately in love with him. However, she decided that her actions were <b>wrong</b> <b>because</b> he was married and she determined that she would become a nun. When she met with Roderick later, he tells her that he wants to leave his wife. In turn, she reveals that she wanted to become a nun, which leads to a fight and, without any description or explanation, she was taken.|$|E

25|$|I {{had watched}} Ken Barrington – a great Test batsman – {{as a boy}} and when I broke into the England side in the late Seventies he became a father figure. In fact, he was a mentor {{to a lot of}} us then – myself, David Gower, Ian Botham, Mike Gatting. Ken was an England {{selector}} and assistant manager on the West Indies tour of 1981. There were no official coach in those days but it was to Ken that most of us turned. Unlike many retired pros, he never used the words, 'In my day...' On the first night of the Test, he suffered a heart attack in our hotel. I was woken the next morning at around 8am by tour manager Alan Smith and captain Ian Botham. I knew something was <b>wrong,</b> <b>because</b> Both was never up before then. They told me the news. I had tears in my eyes when we went out on to the pitch for the minute's silence and again when I was batting in the second innings. We needed over 500 to win and it soon became apparent that we weren't going to get them. But I kept thinking of him and managed to make a hundred. Kenny was a counsellor, a friend and an inspiration.|$|E

According to Bell, [...] "The way the shows usually work out, Mulder is the one to figure out who the bad guys are. So I went into the story meeting with the idea of having Mulder being <b>wrong.</b> <b>Because</b> Mulder believes so strong it's the other guy, it helped hide the true identity of the bad guy from the audience." ...|$|E

His older sister [...] lives in Tokyo in the dorm room next to the Akitsukis from Suzuka. He has a long-time crush on classmate Nanami Kanzaki, but his feelings shift towards Yuzuki as the series progresses. At the end of the series, he marries Yuzuki, has a son named Daiki, and opens up his own restaurant. In both Tatsunoko Production's and Gonzo's anime, he is voiced by Yoshimasa Hosoya.|$|E

60|$|What is wrong, then? Whatever {{is unlike}} right; {{whatever}} is unlike goodness; whatever is unlike God; that is wrong. And why does God forbid {{us to do}} <b>wrong?</b> Simply <b>because</b> <b>wrong</b> is unlike himself. He is perfectly beautiful, perfectly blest and happy, because he is perfectly good; and he wishes to see all his creatures beautiful, blest, and happy: but they can only be so by being perfectly good; and they can only be perfectly good by being perfectly like God their Father; and they can only be perfectly like God the Father by being full of love, loving their neighbour as themselves.|$|R
500|$|In Stage one (obedience and {{punishment}} driven), individuals {{focus on the}} direct {{consequences of their actions}} on themselves. For example, an action is perceived as morally <b>wrong</b> <b>because</b> the perpetrator is punished. [...] "The last time I did that I got spanked, so I will not do it again." [...] The worse the punishment for the act is, the more [...] "bad" [...] the act is perceived to be. This can give rise to an inference that even innocent victims are guilty in proportion to their suffering. It is [...] "egocentric", lacking recognition that others' points of view are different from one's own. There is [...] "deference to superior power or prestige".|$|E
500|$|Throughout the {{astronaut}} office {{there were a}} few people, most notably Walter Cunningham, who publicly stated that Armstrong and Scott had ignored the malfunction procedures for such an incident, and that Armstrong could have salvaged the mission if he had turned on only one of the two RCS rings, saving the other for mission objectives. These criticisms were unfounded; no malfunction procedures were written and it was possible to turn on only both RCS rings, not just one or the other. Gene Kranz wrote, [...] "the crew reacted as they were trained, and they reacted <b>wrong</b> <b>because</b> we trained them wrong." [...] The mission planners and controllers had failed to realize that when two spacecraft are docked together, they must be considered to be one spacecraft.|$|E
500|$|Although Tony Hutchinson (Nick Pickard) {{was in a}} {{relationship}} with Mercedes' sister, Jacqui (Claire Cooper), he and Mercedes had sex. Metcalfe explained this was because Mercedes was intoxicated and unaware of her actions, [...] "but she was also furious at Jacqui for giving her a slap". Metcalfe explained that when Mercedes woke up, she was in disbelief about the events of the previous night and felt [...] "appalled". She added that Mercedes did not fancy Tony and that they did not even like each other, which was why [...] "neither of them can understand what happened between them". Regarding Mercedes' feelings about hurting Jacqui, Metcalfe stated: [...] "Mercedes hates herself for it. She feels incredibly guilty and ashamed of what she's done. It's surprising Jacqui doesn't guess something is <b>wrong</b> <b>because</b> Mercedes can't look her in the eye".|$|E

Errors occur with computers. Things like 'Although it's fine to speak the instructions' and 'Please fix this problem here' might be spoken in a cute voice." [...] In addition, an explanation for Chobitss plot was given by Igarashi who stated: [...] "Back then, when our computer had problems all we would get were these inscrutable error messages. However, {{we had no idea}} what was <b>wrong</b> <b>because</b> it wouldn't tell us any more". Clamp also describes Chobits as a variation of the [...] "boy living with mysterious girl" [...] genre. Chi's design as a personal computer resulted from Ohkawa's wish to increase the sense of [...] "emotional discomfort" [...] around becoming emotionally involved with something considered to be merely a lifeless machine.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} Clive Ruggles {{has argued}} that {{there are problems with}} the selection of data in Thom's surveys. Others have noted that the accuracy of horizon astronomy is limited by variations in refraction near the horizon. A deeper criticism of Green archaeoastronomy is that while it can answer whether there was likely to be an interest in astronomy in past times, its lack of a social element means that it struggles to answer why people would be interested, which makes it of limited use to people asking questions about the society of the past. Keith Kintigh wrote: [...] "To put it bluntly, in many cases it doesn't matter much to the progress of anthropology whether a particular archaeoastronomical claim is right or <b>wrong</b> <b>because</b> the information doesn’t inform the current interpretive questions." [...] Nonetheless the study of alignments remains a staple of archaeoastronomical research, especially in Europe.|$|E
500|$|Empirical {{testing of}} the Whorfian {{hypothesis}} declined in the 1960s to 1980s as Noam Chomsky began to redefine linguistics and much of psychology in formal universalist terms. Several studies from that period refuted Whorf's hypothesis, demonstrating that linguistic diversity is a surface veneer that masks underlying universal cognitive principles. Many studies were highly critical and disparaging in their language, ridiculing Whorf's analyses and examples or his lack of an academic degree. Throughout the 1980s most mentions of Whorf or of the Sapir-Whorf hypotheses continued to be disparaging, {{and led to a}} widespread view that Whorf's ideas had been proven <b>wrong.</b> <b>Because</b> Whorf was treated so severely in the scholarship during those decades, he has been described as [...] "one of the prime whipping boys of introductory texts to linguistics". In the late 1980s, with the advent of cognitive linguistics and psycholinguistics some linguists sought to rehabilitate Whorf's reputation, as scholarship began to question whether earlier critiques of Whorf were justified.|$|E
