5|$|An amended {{version of}} the show toured across Britain in 1987. Sallis was {{reluctant}} {{to appear in the}} new production, and his role in the show <b>was</b> <b>rewritten</b> and played by Derek Fowlds. Because Owen was {{the only member of the}} television show's trio to appear in the production, it was retitled Compo Plays Cupid. Once again, the summer season was a success.|$|E
5|$|Fang was {{originally}} scripted to be a male character {{during the early}} stages of Final Fantasy XIIIs development, but early in the writing stage, <b>was</b> <b>rewritten</b> as a female character. Along with this, the sex appeal that {{was originally}} {{going to be part of}} Lightning's look was transferred to Fang to give Lightning a more hard-edged persona. Fang is voiced by Rachel Robinson in English, and Mabuki Andou in Japanese.|$|E

5|$|In February 2001, Ehren Kruger {{sold his}} spec script to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). With Gilliam's hiring as director, the script <b>was</b> <b>rewritten</b> by Gilliam and Tony Grisoni, but the Writers Guild of America refused to credit {{them for their}} work, thus Kruger {{received}} sole credit. MGM eventually dropped out as distributor, but decided to co-finance The Brothers Grimm with Dimension Films and Summit Entertainment, while Dimension took over distribution duties.|$|E
5|$|SAS version 4 {{had limited}} features, but made SAS more accessible. Version 5 {{introduced}} a complete macro language, array subscripts, and a full-screen interactive user interface called Display Manager. In 1985, SAS <b>was</b> <b>rewritten</b> in the C programming language. This {{allowed for the}} SAS' Multivendor Architecture that allows the software to run on UNIX, MS-DOS, and Windows. It was previously written in PL/I, Fortran, and assembly language.|$|E
5|$|After the {{unexpected}} loss of Armend√°riz, production proceeded, experiencing complications from uncredited rewrites by Berkely Mather during filming. Editor Peter Hunt set about editing the film while key elements were {{still to be}} filmed, helping to restructure the opening scenes. Hunt and Young conceived of moving the Red Grant training sequence {{to the beginning of}} the film (prior to the main title), a signature feature that has been an enduring hallmark of every Bond film since. The briefing with Blofeld <b>was</b> <b>rewritten,</b> and back projection was used to re-film Lotte Lenya's lines.|$|E

5|$|Frost at Midnight {{was written}} in February 1798. It is based on Coleridge's {{childhood}} {{as well as his}} friendship with Wordsworth, who first exposed Coleridge to the wild beauty of the Lake District. The poem was published in a small work containing his France: An Ode and Fears in Solitude. It <b>was</b> <b>rewritten</b> many times; seven versions have been printed. Of these, the 1798 edition contains six concluding lines that were removed from later editions.|$|E
5|$|Cane Ashby is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the American CBS soap opera The Young and the Restless. He is portrayed by Australian actor Daniel Goddard, who originally auditioned for Brad Snyder on As the World Turns but was recommended {{for a role}} on The Young and the Restless instead. The role was to be portrayed as an American, but Goddard's Australian descent influenced the character's background. Former head writer Lynn Marie Latham introduced him during the episode airing on January 12, 2007 as an Australian bartender {{in search of his}} family. Latham created Cane as the son of Phillip Chancellor II (Donnelly Rhodes) and Jill Abbott (Jess Walton) but the character's background <b>was</b> <b>rewritten</b> by Maria Arena Bell in 2009, re-establishing him as the son of Colin and Genevieve Atkinson (Tristan Rogers and Genie Francis).|$|E
5|$|During the screenwriting process when Ephron {{would not}} feel like writing, she would {{interview}} people {{who worked for the}} production company. Some of the interviews appeared in the film as the interludes between certain scenes featuring couples talking about how they met, although the material <b>was</b> <b>rewritten</b> and reshot with actors. Ephron supplied the structure of the film with much of the dialogue based on the real-life friendship between Reiner and Crystal. For example, in the scene where Sally and Harry appear on a split screen, talking on the telephone while watching their respective television sets, channel surfing, was something that Crystal and Reiner did every night.|$|E

5|$|Early {{concepts}} {{were very}} different from the final film. The initial version featured a floating castle with two brothers vying to inherit their father's kingdom, and when the brothers fell to Earth, they encountered a tall bird who helped them understand each other. Docter's next idea introduced many of the elements that eventually made their way into the film, but had Carl and Russell landing the house on a Soviet-era spy airship camouflaged as a giant cloud rather than on a tepui. This concept <b>was</b> <b>rewritten</b> due to its similarity to another idea Pixar was developing. Another idea Docter added, then removed, was magic fountain-of-youth eggs laid by the bird, in order to explain the age discrepancy between Muntz and Carl, but it was decided that this subplot was too distracting, and that people would forgive the minor inconsistency.|$|E
5|$|For a subplot, Chaplin first {{considered}} a character even {{lower on the}} social scale, a black newsboy. Eventually he opted for a drunken millionaire, a character previously used in the 1921 short The Idle Class. The millionaire plot {{was based on an}} old idea Chaplin had for a short in which two millionaires pick up the Little Tramp from the city dump and show him a good time in expensive clubs before dropping him back off at the dump, so when he woke up, the Tramp would not know if it was real or a dream. This <b>was</b> <b>rewritten</b> into a millionaire who is a friend of the Tramp when drunk but does not recognize him when sober.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, an Atari Jaguar port of Another World was {{confirmed}} {{and approved by}} Chahi. It was released as a limited collector's item in cartridge form, complete with a box and manual published by the association Retro-gaming Connexion (RGC) in 2013. The game engine <b>was</b> <b>rewritten</b> especially for the Atari Jaguar {{to make use of}} the console's several processors: the GPU and blitter perform polygon rendering; the GPU performs on-the-fly data decompression; the DSP plays stereo music and sound effects; and the 68000 CPU performs JIT compilation and execution of the scripts. The Jaguar version is playable in the original graphics 16-color mode and Deluxe 15th Anniversary graphics 256-color mode. It can be played in normal and speed-run modes. It supports five languages: English, German, French, Italian, and Spanish.|$|E

5|$|Initially a {{supporting}} character in New Mutants vol. 2 and its relaunched title, , Weir and DeFilippis {{intended for the}} character to commit suicide early in the series after coming out as gay and finding himself rejected by his family and friends. According to the writers, the story was {{to serve as a}} message about intolerance. Marvel editors scrapped the story due to concerns about the controversy it might generate. The storyline <b>was</b> <b>rewritten</b> and the character survived. He since became a fan favorite and began to be featured regularly throughout the series and as a main character in subsequent X-Men-related titles, including New X-Men and the short-lived Young X-Men.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{the film}} was planned as a short fiction, the project {{evolving}} during 2005. At the time, Nemescu also had planned what would later become the feature film California Dreamin', impossible to film at that moment, deciding that Marilena from P7 could prove a useful exercise for both director and actors. Thus the screenplay <b>was</b> <b>rewritten</b> and filming started with a very reduced budget of only US $14,000, which was collected by Nemescu by participating at various film festivals, with older short fictions. During development, however, the film received new funds, though still modest ones, thus the actors {{and a part of}} the team accepted to work for free.|$|E
5|$|Moonraker was {{published}} in the UK by Jonathan Cape in hardback format on 5 April 1955 with a cover designed by Kenneth Lewis, following Fleming's suggestions of using a stylised flame motif; the first impression was of 9,900 copies. The US publication was by Macmillan on 20 September that year. In October 1956 Pan Books published a paperback version of the novel in the UK, which sold 43,000 copies {{before the end of the}} year. In December that year the US paperback {{was published}} under the title Too Hot to Handle by Permabooks. This edition <b>was</b> <b>rewritten</b> to Americanise the British idioms used, and Fleming provided a number of explanatory footnotes such as the value of English currency against the dollar. Since its initial publication the book has been issued in numerous hardback and paperback editions, translated into several languages and has never been out of print.|$|E

5|$|One Foot used Bournemouth to film some {{exterior}} sequences {{because of}} its favourable climate, easy access to London, and economical benefits relative to filming in the capital. After the first series was filmed, the housenear Pokesdown, Bournemouthwhich had been used for the Meldrews' house in location sequences, changed hands and the new owners demanded nearly treble the usage fees that the previous owners had asked for. Rather than agree to this, the production team decided {{to find a new}} house, and the first episode of the second series <b>was</b> <b>rewritten</b> to have the Meldrews' house destroyed in a fire (Filmed on waste ground in Northcote Road, Springbourne). This also gave the opportunity for a new interior set to be designed, as Belbin had been unhappy with the original set designed for the series, which she felt was too restrictive to shoot in.|$|E
5|$|T. R. Rajakumari {{was chosen}} to play Chandralekha {{replacing}} Vasan's first choice, K. L. V. Vasantha. According to film historian Randor Guy, Vasan chose Rajakumari over Vasantha because she was leaving Gemini Studios for Modern Theatres in Salem, Tamil Nadu. In April 1947 N. S. Krishnan, who had been convicted in the Lakshmikanthan murder case, {{was released from prison}} on appeal; Vasan recruited Krishnan and T. A. Madhuram to play the circus artists who help Veerasimhan rescue Chandralekha from Sasankan. The script <b>was</b> <b>rewritten,</b> with scenes added to showcase the comic duo. Madurai Sriramulu Naidu and S. N. Lakshmi made their acting debuts in the film; Naidu had an uncredited role as a horseman, and Lakshmi was a dancer in the climactic drum-dance scene.|$|E
5|$|The game <b>was</b> <b>rewritten</b> in C++ by games {{developer}} Simon Roth in 2011, allowing Linux {{support to}} be successfully implemented. This formed version 2.0 of VVVVVV, launched on July 24, 2011 {{as part of}} the third Humble Indie Bundle. Version 2.0 also features support for custom levels, and a level editor. The C++ port also allowed for the implementation of new graphics modes and various speed improvements. Version 2.0, however, does not support saved games from the original Flash version of VVVVVV; many players received this update via Steam without warning, and hence were unable to continue their existing saved games. A save-file exporter is in development.|$|E
