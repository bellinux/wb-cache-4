5|$|In {{selecting}} Ved Vejen for the Danish Culture Canon, {{the selection}} committee {{operating under the}} Danish Ministry of Culture explained that the attraction {{of the novel is}} that it portrays with considerable empathy how a meek young woman becomes increasingly aware of desires she hardly knew she possessed. With bittersweet irony, the author allows Katinka to develop her infatuation by listening to the heartaches of others. With its almost cinematic sequences, the novel conveys a balance between its subdued humour and a strong sympathy for <b>what</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> people's minds, especially in a secluded environment removed from mainstream society. It is not just Bang's portrayal of a bygone provincial world that seems so typically Danish but his mastery in making the hidden pain of loneliness so meaningful to today's readership. In 1988 it was made into a feature film Katinka, directed by Max von Sydow, starring Tammi Øst as Katinka.|$|E

25|$|The many-worlds {{interpretation}} originally {{outlined by}} Hugh Everett III in 1957 is partly meant {{to reconcile the}} differences between Einstein's and Bohr's views by replacing Bohr's wave function collapse with an ensemble of deterministic and independent universes whose distribution is governed by wave functions and the Schrödinger equation. Thus, uncertainty in the many-worlds interpretation follows from each observer within any universe having no knowledge of <b>what</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> the other universes.|$|E
25|$|Any {{explanation}} of <b>what</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> a specific individual observation of one photon {{has to take}} into account the whole experimental apparatus of the complete quantum state consisting of both photons, and it can only make sense after all information concerning complementary variables has been recorded. Our results demonstrate that the viewpoint that the system photon behaves either definitely as a wave or definitely as a particle would require faster-than-light communication. Because this would be in strong tension with the special theory of relativity, we believe that such a viewpoint should be given up entirely.|$|E
25|$|Transient (state) {{loneliness}} {{is temporary}} in nature, caused by {{something in the}} environment, and is easily relieved. Chronic (trait) loneliness is more permanent, caused by the person, and is not easily relieved. For example, {{when a person is}} sick and cannot socialize with friends would be a case of transient loneliness. Once the person got better it would be easy for them to alleviate their loneliness. A person who feels lonely regardless of if they are at a family gathering, with friends, or alone is experiencing chronic loneliness. It does not matter <b>what</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> the surrounding environment, the experience of loneliness is always there.|$|E

He was the first director of Cairo University, in which he served from 1925 to 1941. He was considered one of the first Egyptian officials to introduce Mill’s works to the general Arab public, so they could educate themselves on concepts of liberalism. He believed that people should have a say in <b>what</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> their government and country, and that all people had certain civil rights that could not be taken away.|$|E
2500|$|Alex Rosenberg {{makes an}} {{extrapolation}} of physical determinism as inferred on the macroscopic scale by the behaviour {{of a set}} of dominoes to neural activity in the brain where; [...] "If the brain is nothing but a complex physical object whose states are as much governed by physical laws as any other physical object, then <b>what</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> our heads is as fixed and determined by prior events as what goes on when one domino topples another in a long row of them." [...] Physical determinism is currently disputed by prominent interpretations of quantum mechanics, and while not necessarily representative of intrinsic indeterminism in nature, fundamental limits of precision in measurement are inherent in the uncertainty principle. The relevance of such prospective indeterminate activity to free will is, however, contested, even when chaos theory is introduced to magnify the effects of such microscopic events.|$|E

2500|$|The Oxford English Dictionary {{traces the}} {{earliest}} use (as [...] "Androides") to Ephraim Chambers' Cyclopaedia, {{in reference to}} an automaton that St. Albertus Magnus allegedly created. The term [...] "android" [...] appears in US patents as early as 1863 in reference to miniature human-like toy automatons. The term android was used in a more modern sense by the French author Auguste Villiers de l'Isle-Adam in his work Tomorrow's Eve (1886). This story features an artificial humanlike robot named Hadaly. As said by the officer in the story, [...] "In this age of Realien advancement, who knows <b>what</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> the mind of those responsible for these mechanical dolls." [...] The term made an impact into English pulp science fiction starting from Jack Williamson's The Cometeers (1936) and the distinction between mechanical robots and fleshy androids was popularized by Edmond Hamilton's Captain Future (1940–1944).|$|E

Spitzer subsequently announced that he would indefinitely suspend his communications director, Darren Dopp, and reassign another top official. When questioned about his promise to bring ethical responsibility to state politics, Spitzer responded by saying [...] "I will not tolerate this behavior", [...] "ethics and accountability must and will remain rigorous in my administration," [...] and that [...] "I have always stated that I want ethics and integrity to be the hallmarks of my administration.

2500|$|Producer Reo Kurosu has {{described}} the show's animation style as [...] "a hybrid between 2D and 3D", elaborating that [...] "For this series we’re {{trying to do something}} new. The director is a 2D animator so <b>what</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> his mind and what he puts on storyboard is all in 2D. From there it’s all about choosing which tool to use between full CG animation, traditional 2D, or a hybrid of the two. The director and the 2D and 3D studios will meet and discuss what to use when depending upon what we’re trying to accomplish with each scene." [...] The 3D characters and objects are rendered with Cel shading to make them look more like 2D cartoons. A particular feature is that the shadows on 3D objects contain a linear hatching effect which simulates shading with a pen or pencil, and the same hatching effect is applied to the shadows that appear on any 2D models to create a more uniform look.|$|E
