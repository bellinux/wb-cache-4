40|$|Under the {{supervision}} of Professor Steven Cramer; Pages: 149. Over the past decade, {{there has been a}} growing interest in the development of consumer and industrial products composed of wood fillers combined with thermoplastic resins. The use of wood flour as a reinforcing filler for thermoplastics has several benefits. Wood fillers have the advantage of being renewable, inexpensive, lightweight, and non- abrasive to processing equipment. Both materials can be obtained from post-consumer or post-industrial recycling sources. Little information is available concerning the engineering characteristics of wood- plastic composite panels. Recently. there has been an increasing interest in using this type of material for a variety of structural applications. To quantify the material performance, several different wood-flour thermoplastic formulations ranging from 0 % to 60 % <b>wood</b> <b>filler</b> content by weight were produced and tested according to the ASTM D 1037 standard for wood-based panels. A matched set of specimens underwent the accelerated aging process outlined in the standard. It was found that by increasing the ratio of <b>wood</b> <b>filler,</b> the material performance properties were altered. The modulus of elasticity and water absorption increased, while the coefficient of thermal expansion and ultimate stress values decreased. The aging process had very little effect on the 0 % <b>wood</b> <b>filler</b> content samples and decreased the material performance in some properties for the higher wood percentage panels. The results were compared with conventional wood-based panel products. Included were particleboard, hardboard, plywood, medium density fiberboard, and oriented. strandboard.

This study was conducted to clarify the contributions of moisture and wood decay fungi to WPC damage. Changes in flexural strength (MOR), modulus (MOE), and weight of two extruded wood-polyethylene composite (WPC) formulations, yellow-poplar sapwood and redwood heartwood, were compared following 3 months of incubation with wood decay fungi. All materials were evaluated using modified agar-block tests in which the white-rot fungus Trametes versicolor and the brown-rot fungus Gloeophyllum trabeum were employed as test fungi. In addition, soil-block tests were performed with yellow-poplar, one WPC formulation, and T. versicolor as test fungus only. It was determined that stiffness of WPC was affected more severely by moisture absorption than by fungal colonization. Strength of WPC was not affected by decay fungi but significantly (p 0. 0001) reduced by moisture absorption for a formulation containing 70 % <b>wood</b> <b>filler.</b> Calculation of weight loss in WPC was based on the wood fraction only. Modified agar-block and soil-block tests were equally suited for determining weight loss in WPC, but agar-block tests could be completed in a shorter time span. Weight loss of a formulation with 70 % <b>wood</b> <b>filler</b> and incubated with T. versicolor was twice as high as that of redwood in a modified agar-block test (6 % versus 3 %); however, only 1 % weight loss was obtained when the formulation contained 49 % <b>wood</b> <b>filler.</b> These results indicate that WPC can be designed to provide high fungal durability by controlling the material composition of the formulation.

A notable advance in the polymer industry has been the use of fiber and particulate fillers as reinforcements in polymer matrix. Over the last few decades, the considerable attention has been devoted towards wood dust filled polymer composites due to its many advantages. These include mainly the improved nvironmental performance, due {{to the use of}} biodegradable materials and the reduction in the use of non-renewable (oil based) resources throughout the whole life cycle of the composite; the low cost of wood flour; the lower specific weight of these fillers, in comparison to the traditional mineral-inorganic ones; the improvement in safety for the production employees and the special aesthetic properties of the composites.

This study concerns the production of PMMA-based composites by partly replacing alumina trihydrate (ATH) with <b>wood</b> waste <b>fillers,</b> namely rice husks and almond shells, which would otherwise be disposed by incineration. The amount of filler introduced was limited to 10 % as regards rice husks and 10 or 15 % almond shells, since indications provided by reactivity tests and viscosity measurements did not suggest the feasibility of total replacement of ATH.

5000|$|Cabinet {{frames and}} doors may be {{fashioned}} from solid wood (typically {{a species of}} hardwood), medium density fiberboard (MDF), particle board, plywood, or a combination, and may include lamination or a surface coating over these core materials. A floating panel in a door can be hardwood-veneer plywood captured within a solid wood or MDF frame. Solid wood and MDF can be edge-shaped, e.g., to round or pattern the edges of doors, drawer fronts, or face frames. Particle board, once manufactured, cannot be edge-shaped suitably. Plywood cannot be shaped without revealing its veneer core, often considered unsightly, though edge-shaped furniture-grade plywood with thin plies 1/16 in is considered attractive for limited uses. MDF, once shaped, can be coated conformally with flexible veneers such as thermofoil or can be painted. It can also be covered with wood veneer or high-pressure laminate {{but only if the}} edge profile is square or approximately so (to within the veneer thickness). Today many cabinet doors and drawer fronts utilize an MDF core. Doors and drawer fronts may also be fashioned of particle board surfaced with high-pressure laminate. Natural wood offers its subtle combination of color, grain, pore pattern, variable absorption and smoothness of finish, and variation with viewing angle and lighting condition. The appearance of natural wood can only be achieved with solid wood components (wherever edges are shaped) or possibly veneer (where they are not); as already pointed out, the two approaches can be combined in a single cabinet. Various transparent grain-revealing finishes including shellac, lacquer, varnish, or polyurethane have been devised. A built-up finish may optionally utilize diverse pigments, dyes, bleaches, glazes, or <b>wood</b> <b>fillers</b> that may highlight contrasting colorants. Finishes can be applied by brush or spray and may comprise many separately applied layers. Accordingly, finishes formulated by differing manufacturers do not, in general, exactly match. Distressing the wood cabinets is another finish application and is often done in conjunction with glazes, stains, paints or dyes. This process consists of adding manufactured imperfections to cabinet doors to give the wood cabinets an aged, distressed, old-world rustic appearance. Common techniques include creating wormholes, rasping, dings and dents and sanding through the wood and layers of finish unevenly.|$|R
