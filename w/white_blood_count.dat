40|$|Background High <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> cell <b>count</b> at {{presentation}} is an unfavorable prognostic factor for treatment outcome in intermediate cytogenetic risk acute myeloid leukemia. Since {{the impact of}} <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> cell <b>count</b> on outcome of subgroups defined by the molecular markers NPMc(+) and FLT 3 -internal tandem duplication (ITD) is unknown, we addressed this issue. Design and Methods We studied the effect of <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> cell <b>count</b> on outcome in a clinically and molecularly well-defined cohort of 525 patients with acute myeloid leukemia using these molecular markers. In addition, since an increased <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> cell <b>count</b> {{has been associated with}} an increased FLT 3 -ITD/FLT 3 (wild-type) ratio, we investigated whether the effect of <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> cell <b>count</b> on outcome could be explained by the FLT 3 -ITD/FLT 3 ratio. Results This analysis revealed that <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> cell <b>count</b> had no impact on outcome in patients with the genotypic combinations 'NPMc(+) without FLT 3 -ITD' and 'NPM 1 wild-type with or without FLT 3 -ITD'. In contrast, <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> cell <b>count</b> {{had a significant impact on}} complete remission rate (P= 0. 034), event-free survival (P= 0. 009) and overall survival (P Conclusions Our results demonstrate that both high <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> cell <b>count</b> and FLT 3 -ITD/FLT 3 ratio are prognostic factors in patients with acute myeloid leukemia with the genotypic combination 'NPMc(+) with FLT 3 -ITD'...|$|R

40|$|Dogs {{were exposed}} to either trichloroethylene(TCL) or 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane(TCE) in order to {{investigate}} {{the effects of these}} solvents on hematologic parameters. Further-more, because of unusual changes in <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> cell <b>counts</b> following exposure of pregnant dogs to these solvents, investigation of the effects of several hormones given prior to exposure to the solvents was pursued. The results obtained were as follows. 1. <b>White</b> <b>blood</b> cell <b>counts</b> showed a marked decrease immediately after starting exposure to TCL or 1, 1, 1 -TCE, though the decrease was temporary. On the other hand red <b>blood</b> cell <b>counts,</b> hematocrit values and <b>blood</b> platelet <b>counts</b> showed no changes. 2.

50|$|In someone {{suspected}} of having cholecystitis, blood tests are performed for markers of inflammation (e.g. complete blood count, C-reactive protein), as well as bilirubin levels {{in order to assess}} for bile duct blockage. Complete blood count typically shows an increased <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>count</b> (12,000-15,000/mcL). C-reactive protein is usually elevated although not commonly measured in the United States. Bilirubin levels are often mildly elevated (1-4 mg/dL). If bilirubin levels are more significantly elevated, alternate or additional diagnoses should be considered such as gallstone blocking the common bile duct (common bile duct stone). Less commonly, blood aminotransferases are elevated. The degree of elevation of these laboratory values may depend on the degree of inflammation of the gallbladder.|$|E

50|$|Cancer {{biomarkers}} {{can also}} be used to determine the most effective treatment regime for a particular person's cancer. Because of differences in each person's genetic makeup, some people metabolize or change the chemical structure of drugs differently. In some cases, decreased metabolism of certain drugs can create dangerous conditions in which high levels of the drug accumulate in the body. As such, drug dosing decisions in particular cancer treatments can benefit from screening for such biomarkers. An example is the gene encoding the enzyme thiopurine methyl-transferase (TPMPT). Individuals with mutations in the TPMT gene are unable to metabolize large amounts of the leukemia drug, mercaptopurine, which potentially causes a fatal drop in <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>count</b> for such patients. Patients with TPMT mutations are thus recommended to be given a lower dose of mercaptopurine for safety considerations.|$|E
50|$|After a liver transplantation, {{there are}} three types of graft {{rejection}} that may occur. They include hyperacute rejection, acute rejection and chronic rejection. Hyperacute rejection is caused by preformed anti-donor antibodies. It {{is characterized by the}} binding of these antibodies to antigens on vascular endothelial cells. Complement activation is involved and the effect is usually profound. Hyperacute rejection happens within minutes to hours after the transplant procedure. Unlike hyperacute rejection, which is B cell mediated, acute rejection is mediated by T cells. It involves direct cytotoxicity and cytokine mediated pathways. Acute rejection is the most common and the primary target of immunosuppressive agents. Acute rejection is usually seen within days or weeks of the transplant. Chronic rejection is the presence of any sign and symptom of rejection after 1 year. The cause of chronic rejection is still unknown but an acute rejection is a strong predictor of chronic rejections.Liver rejection may happen anytime after the transplant. Lab findings of a liver rejection include abnormal AST, ALT, GGT and liver function values such as prothrombin time, ammonia level, bilirubin level, albumin concentration, and blood glucose. Physical findings include encephalopathy, jaundice, bruising and bleeding tendency. Other nonspecific presentation are malaise, anorexia, muscle ache, low fever, slight increase in <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>count</b> and graft-site tenderness.|$|E

5000|$|There is {{no current}} cure for {{superficial}} siderosis, only treatments to help alleviate the current symptoms {{and to help}} prevent the development of further symptoms. If a source of bleeding can be identified (sources are frequently not found), then surgical correction of the bleeding source can be performed; this {{has proved to be}} effective in halting the development of further symptoms in some cases and has no effect on symptoms that have already presented. Patients with superficial siderosis are often treated with deferiprone, a lipid-soluble iron chelator, as this medication has been demonstrated to chelate iron in the central nervous system. [...] While on this drug you wil need a frequent blood test (weekly) {{to keep an eye on}} the blood levels as this drug is known to lower certain blood levels such as the neutrophils and WBC (<b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>count)</b> and etc. While it is ok if these levels go low in the average person, if they go low while taking Deferiprone Ferriprox it can cause life threatening infections that can result in death. Alleviation of the most common symptom, hearing loss, has been varyingly successful through the use of cochlear implants. Most people do not notice a large improvement after successful implantation, which is most likely due to damage to the vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII) and not the cochlea itself. Some people fare far better, with a return to near normal hearing, but there is little ability to detect how well a person will respond to this treatment at this time.|$|E
