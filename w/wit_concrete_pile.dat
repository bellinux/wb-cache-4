40|$|The use of precast, {{prestressed}} <b>concrete</b> <b>piles</b> in {{the foundation}} of bridge piers has long been recognized as a valuable option for bridge owners and designers. However, {{the use of these}} precast, prestressed <b>concrete</b> <b>piles</b> in integral abutment bridges has not been widespread because of concerns over pile flexibility and the potential for concrete cracking and deterioration of the prestressing strands due to long-term exposure to moisture. This report presents the details of the first integral abutment bridge in the state of Iowa that utilized precast, prestressed <b>concrete</b> <b>piles</b> in the abutment. The bridge, which was constructed in Tama County in 2000, consists of a 110 ft. long, 30 ft. wide, single-span PC girder superstructure with a left-side-ahead 20 º skew angle. The bridge was instrumented with a variety of strain gages, displacement sensors, and thermocouples to monitor and help in the assessment of structural behavior. The results of this monitoring are presented, and recommendations are made for future application of precast, prestressed <b>concrete</b> <b>piles</b> in integral abutment bridges. In addition to the structural monitoring data, this report presents the results of a survey questionnaire that had been mailed to each of the 50 state DOT chief bridge engineers to ascertain their current practices for precast, prestressed <b>concrete</b> <b>piles</b> and especially the application of these piles in integral abutment bridges...|$|R

The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to study the seismic {{performance}} of prestressed reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>pile</b> (PRC pile) reinforced with nonprestressed reinforcements. Two prestressed high strength <b>concrete</b> <b>piles</b> (PHC piles) and two PRC piles were tested. The variables studied in this research are the prestressed reinforcements ratio and nonprestressed reinforcements ratio. The piles subjected to low-cycle loading were presented in this paper, including the hysteretic performance, stiffness degradation curves, coefficient of equivalent viscous damping and skeleton-frame curves. It is shown that the failure modes of all specimens are bending damage from the test and PRC piles have good energy-absorbing hysteretic behavior...|$|R
