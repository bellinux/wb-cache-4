500|$|Le Mesurier took {{a relaxed}} {{approach}} to acting, saying, [...] "You know the <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> jobbing gardeners? Well, I'm a jobbing actor... {{as long as}} they pay me I couldn't care less if my name is billed above or below the title". Although Le Mesurier played a wide range of parts, he became known as [...] "an indispensable figure in the gallery of second-rank players which were the glory of the British film industry in its more prolific days". He felt his characterisations owed [...] "a lot to my customary expression of bewildered innocence" [...] and tried to stress for many of his roles that his parts were those of [...] "a decent chap all at sea in a chaotic world not of his own making".|$|E
500|$|... "The Duel" [...] {{was written}} by Jennifer Celotta, a {{producer}} and show runner with The Office. The episode featured {{the conclusion of the}} love triangle between Dwight, Andy and Angela, a subplot that had been going on since the fourth season finale, [...] "Goodbye, Toby". The cast and writing staff saw [...] "The Duel" [...] as a defining episode for Andy Bernard because it demonstrated a softer, more emotional side of the character. Dean Holland, who directed the episode, said this was particularly effective because in past episodes, he displayed such rage problems that he had to attend anger management courses, but in [...] "The Duel" [...] he responded to horrible news in a heartrending way. Rainn Wilson particularly praised Ed Helms' performance, saying, [...] "He gives a lot of heart and soul, and Andy is such a doofus and a douche, and now you really get to see his heart break. There's some reality there. That's the great thing this show gives us, just when you think you know the characters and they're two-dimensional and they're goofy and crazy, in their own <b>way,</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> real human redemption." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a radio {{interview}} in July 2001, Ze'evi stated that 180,000 Palestinians worked and lived illegally in Israel. He described {{them as a}} [...] "cancer," [...] and said Israel should rid itself {{of those who were}} not Israeli citizens [...] "the same <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> rid of lice." [...] He called for denying the vote to Arab citizens who did not serve in the army. He believed that Jordan historically belonged to the Tribes of Israel – Gad, Reuven, and Menashe. Zeevi urged Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to [...] "lay waste to the Palestinian Authority" [...] and assassinate PLO leader Yasser Arafat.|$|E
5000|$|In a 2009 interview, actor Mickey Rourke declared: [...] "There's {{definitely}} {{something called}} a casting couch... {{if you take a}} girl from the Midwest with a pretty face and instead of inviting them in for an audition in the morning, the directors invite them for dinner at night? ... I can recall with certain women, we'd go out, I'd park the car on Sunset and by the time I'd got to the curb there'd be three or four producers handing them cards. ... There's <b>ways</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> a job and <b>ways</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> a job." ...|$|R

2500|$|In 1903, Harry Byrd {{took over}} his father's newspaper, the Winchester Star. Under his father's ownership, {{it came to}} owe $2500 (...) to its {{newsprint}} supplier, the Antietam Paper Company. The company refused to ship more newsprint on credit, so Byrd cut a deal to make daily cash payments in return for ownership. As Byrd would later say, [...] "when you have to hunt for them that <b>way,</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> {{to know how many}} cents there really are in a dollar." [...] He eventually bought the Harrisonburg Daily News-Record and several other papers in the Shenandoah Valley; his family still owns these papers today.|$|E
2500|$|Friedman {{supported}} the 2003 invasion of Iraq, writing that {{the establishment of}} a democratic state in the Middle East would force {{other countries in the region}} to liberalize and modernize. In his February 9, 2003, column for The Wall Street, Friedman also pointed to the lack of compliance with the United Nations Security Council Resolution regarding Iraq's weapons of mass destruction: [...] "The French position is utterly incoherent. The inspections have not worked yet, says Mr. de Villepin, because Saddam has not fully cooperated, and, therefore, we should triple the number of inspectors. But the inspections have failed not because of a shortage of inspectors. They have failed because of a shortage of compliance on Saddam's part, as the French know. The <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> that compliance out of a thug like Saddam is not by tripling the inspectors, but by tripling the threat that if he does not comply he will be faced with a U.N.-approved war." [...] Since the invasion, Friedman has expressed alarm over the post-invasion conduct of the war by the George W. Bush administration. Nevertheless, until his piece dated August 4, 2006 (see below), his columns remained hopeful to the possibility of a positive conclusion to the Iraq conflict (although his optimism appeared to steadily diminish as the conflict continued). Friedman chided George W. Bush and Tony Blair [...] for [...] "hyping" [...] the evidence, and stated plainly that converting Iraq to democracy [...] "would be a huge undertaking, though, and maybe impossible, given Iraq's fractious history". In January 2004, he participated in a forum on Slate.com called [...] "Liberal Hawks Reconsider the Iraq War", in which he dismisses the justification for war based on Iraq's lack of compliance with the U.N. Resolutions: [...] "The right reason for this war.. was to oust Saddam's regime and partner with the Iraqi people to try to implement the Arab Human Development report's prescriptions in the heart of the Arab world. That report said the Arab world is falling off the globe because of a lack of freedom, women's empowerment, and modern education. The right reason for this war was to partner with Arab moderates in a long-term strategy of dehumiliation and redignification.|$|E

6000|$|... "There you are! That's just a man's <b>way.</b> <b>You</b> <b>get</b> {{yourself}} into this trouble, you follow your passions and your fancies and fads {{and then you}} turn to me! How can I help you now, Poff? If you'd listened to me before!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's right," [...] said Vergil Gunch. [...] "That's the way I look at it. If {{a fellow}} is keyed {{up to what}} you might call {{intensive}} living, the <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> it here in Zenith--all the hustle and mental activity that's going on with a bunch of live-wires like the Boosters and here in the Z.A.C., why, he's got to save his nerves by having the best." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know all}} that," [...] said Hugh, in reply to this not very lucid explanation: [...] "but it doesn't help me, because the ship hasn't proper days. One way round, {{you get more}} than twenty-four hours to the day, and the other <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> less: so of course the names get wrong: but people that live on in one place always get twenty-four hours to the day." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't know where, but I {{saw them}} {{a few minutes ago}} most {{distinctly}} 'slope.' They've gone for a quiet, unwatched hour, poor dears, out into the park or the gardens. When one knows it, it's all there. But what's that vulgar song?--'You've got to know it first!' It strikes me, if you don't mind my telling you so, that the <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> hold of things is positively uncanny. I mean as regards what first marked her for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's a <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> into," [...] he told me, [...] "of serving them carefully, and I hope, politely, without {{stopping}} your own thinking. I've been reading Christie's New Commercial Plants all this autumn, and that needs keeping your mind on it, I can tell you. So {{long as it}} isn't a prescription, of course, I can carry {{as much as half}} a page of Christie in my head, {{and at the same time}} I could sell out all that window twice over, and not a penny wrong at the end. As to prescriptions, I think I could make up the general run of 'em in my sleep, almost." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{warn you}} of one thing: Ah Sing. He's the cook. He's been {{in our house}} for years and years--oh, I don't know, maybe twenty-five or thirty years he's cooked for father, from long before this house was built or I was born. He's privileged. He's so used to having his own way that you'll have to handle him with gloves. But once he likes you he'll work his fool head off to please you. He likes me that <b>way.</b> <b>You</b> <b>get</b> him to like you, and you'll have the time of your life here. And, honest, I won't give you any trouble at all. It'll be a regular snap, just as if I wasn't here at all." ...|$|E

6000|$|The road lay {{through the}} middle of an empty space which {{seemed to me to be}} a hundred yards wide between the fences. I was not given the width in yards, but only in chains and perches--and furlongs, I think. I would have given a good deal to know what the width was, but I did not pursue the matter. I think it is best to put up with {{information}} the <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> it; and seem satisfied with it, and surprised at it, and grateful for it, and say, [...] "My word!" [...] and never let on. It was a wide space; I could tell you how wide, in chains and perches and furlongs and things, but that would not help you any. Those things sound well, but they are shadowy and indefinite, like troy weight and avoirdupois; nobody knows what they mean. When you buy a pound of a drug and the man asks you which you want, troy or avoirdupois, it is best to say [...] "Yes," [...] and shift the subject.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, sir," [...] cried Loring, {{now almost}} shouting, [...] "that will do. You have shown us the {{strength}} of your lungs. Jump down on {{the seat of the}} chair; now on the table. There, I will take away the chair, and you can stand for a moment on the table and let our friends look at you; but only for a moment. Take that tap on your back. Now do you see any difference? Perhaps you may not, but I do. Yes, I believe you all do. He is not the big fellow he was a minute ago. He is really smaller--only a fine cockerel. A nice tail that, but with none of the noble sweep that it had a minute ago. No, don't try to get off the table. You can't escape my wand. Another tap. Behold a half-grown chicken, good to eat, but with not a crow in him. Hungry, are you? But you need not pick at the table that <b>way.</b> <b>You</b> <b>get</b> no more grain, but only this little tap. Ha, ha! What are you coming to? There is a chicken barely feathered enough for us to tell what color he is going to be.|$|E
6000|$|All round, {{before the}} circus doors were open, the doorkeepers of the side-shows were {{inviting}} {{people to come}} in and see the giants and fat woman and boa-constrictors, and there were stands for peanuts and candy and lemonade; the vendors cried, [...] "Ice-cold lemonade, from fifteen hundred miles under ground! Walk up, roll up, tumble up, any <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> up!" [...] The boys thought this brilliant drolling, but they had no time to listen after the doors were open, and they had no money to spend on side-shows or dainties anyway. Inside the tent they found it dark and cool, and their hearts thumped in their throats with the wild joy of being there; they recognized one another with amaze, as if they had not met for years, and the excitement kept growing as other fellows came in. It was lots of fun, too, watching the country-jakes, as the boys called the farmer-folk, and seeing how green they looked, and now some of them tried to act smart with the circus men that came round with oranges to sell. But the great thing was to see whether fellows that {{said they were going to}} hook in really got in. The boys held it to be a high and creditable thing to hook into a show of any kind, but hooking into a circus was something that a fellow ought to be held in special honor for doing. He ran great risks, and if he escaped the vigilance of the massive circus man who patrolled the outside of the tent with a cow-hide and a bulldog, perhaps he merited the fame he was sure to win.|$|E

6000|$|... "Ever {{since we}} parted I {{have gone on}} the same line, only I have worked carefully. I was not a bad-looking chap, and hadn't much {{difficulty}} in getting over servant girls and finding out where things were to be had, so I gradually got on. For years now I have only carried on big affairs, working the thing up and always employing other hands to carry the job out. None of them know me here. I meet them at quiet pubs and arrange things there, and I need hardly say that I am so disguised {{that none of the}} fellows who follow my orders would know me again if they met me in the street. I could retire if I liked, and live in a villa and keep my carriage. Why, I made five thousand pounds as my share of that bullion robbery between London and Brussels. But I know that I should be miserable without anything to do; as it is, I unite amusement with business. I sometimes take a stall at the Opera, and occasionally I find a diamond necklace in my pocket when I get home. I know well enough that it is foolish, but when I see a thing that I need only put out my hand to have, my old habit is too strong for me. Then I often walk into swell entertainments. You have only to be well got up, and to go rather late, so that the hostess has given up expecting arrivals and is occupied with her guests, and the flunky takes your hat without question, and you go upstairs and mix with the people. In that <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> to know as to the women who have the finest jewels, and have no difficulty in finding out their names. I have got hold of some very good things that way, but though {{there would have been no}} difficulty in taking some of them at the time, I never yielded to that temptation. In a crowded room one never can say whose eyes may happen to be looking in your direction.|$|E
6000|$|It {{is surely}} a rare {{experience}} for an unclassified man, past middle age, to hear himself accurately and aptly described {{for the first}} time in his life by a perfect stranger! This thing happened to me at Bristol, some time ago, in the way I am about to relate. I slept at a Commercial Hotel, and early next morning was joined in the big empty coffee-room, smelling of stale tobacco, by an intensely respectable- looking old gentleman, whose hair was of silvery whiteness, and who wore gold-rimmed spectacles and a heavy gold watch-chain with many seals attached thereto; whose linen was of the finest, and whose outer garments, including the trousers, were of the newest and blackest broadcloth. A glossier and at the same time a more venerable-looking [...] "commercial" [...] I had never seen in the west country, nor anywhere in the three kingdoms. He could not have improved his appearance if he had been on his way to attend the funeral of a millionaire. But with all his superior look he was quite affable, and talked fluently and instructively on a variety of themes, including trade, politics, and religion. Perceiving that he had taken me for what I was not--one of the army in which he served, but of inferior rank--I listened respectfully as became me. Finally he led the talk to the subject of agriculture, and the condition and prospects of farming in England. Here I perceived that he was on wholly unfamiliar ground, and in return for the valuable information he had given me on other and more important subjects, I proceeded to enlighten him. When I had finished stating my facts and views, he said: [...] "I perceive that you know a great deal more about the matter than I do, and I will now tell you why you know more. You are a traveller in little things--in something very small--which takes you into the villages and hamlets, where you meet and converse with small farmers, innkeepers, labourers and their wives, with other persons who live on the land. In this <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> to hear a good deal about rent and cost of living, and what the people are able and not able to do. Now I am out of all that; I never go to a village nor see a farmer. I am a traveller in something very large. In the south and west I visit towns like Salisbury, Exeter, Bristol, Southampton; then I go to the big towns in the Midlands and the North, and to Glasgow and Edinburgh; and afterwards to Belfast and Dublin. It would simply be a waste of time for me to visit a town of less than fifty or sixty thousand inhabitants." ...|$|E
50|$|Perhaps the easiest, not the shortest, but {{the finest}} access is to {{park at the}} highest point on the road through Dyrskar.
