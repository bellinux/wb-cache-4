5|$|The {{idea for}} Whitepages was {{conceived}} by Alex Algard, while studying at Stanford in 1996. Algard {{was searching for}} a friend's contact information and the phone company gave him the wrong number. He thought of an online email directory as an easier to way to find people. Algard bought the Whitepages.com domain for $900, which he says <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> his savings at the time. He continued operating the website as a hobby while working as an investment banker for Goldman Sachs. He expanded the database of contact information using data licensed from American Business Information (now a part of Infogroup). Eventually WhitePages was producing more ad-revenue than Algard was earning at Goldman Sachs. In 1998, Algard left his job {{to focus on the}} website; he incorporated Whitepages in 2000.|$|E

Two weeks later, Chuck returns from his honeymoon to a deserted Castle, where he learns from Decker {{that he has been}} {{manipulated}} his entire spy career, leading to him receiving the Intersect and facing Fulcrum, the Ring, Daniel Shaw, and Volkoff. It is then revealed that Hartley's gift <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> Volkoff Industries' assets, giving Chuck and Sarah almost a billion dollars. Chuck purchases the Buy More from the government's front company, and he, Sarah, Casey, and Morgan Grimes (Joshua Gomez) set up their own freelance spy operation in Castle to investigate the conspiracy involving Chuck. Morgan then spots a pair of glasses in a box of Chuck's belongings sent from Beckman. Morgan puts them on and accidentally uploads an Intersect.|$|E

25|$|The {{municipality}} had ambitions to make Hjellestad {{the largest}} water {{airport in the}} country. The plans included building a causeway to the island of Dronningen, which would have cost several million Norwegian krone. The rationale was that Bergen <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> cities of similar size in Norway had a land airport. By 1950 the expansion plans were shelved to allow the funding {{to be used to}} build a land airport instead.|$|E

Their main trail took approximately the route of Broadway. One encampment in the Lower East Side area, near Corlears Hook was called Rechtauck or Naghtogack.|$|E
25|$|Stanton's role in Manny's legal trio {{was as a}} researcher. Though he {{admitted}} that George Harding, an established patent lawyer, was more adept at the scientific aspects of the case, Stanton worked to summarize the relevant jurisprudence and case law. To win McCormick v. Manny for Manny, Stanton, Harding and Watson had to impress upon the court that McCormick had no claim to exclusivity in his reaper's use of a divider, a mechanism on the outer end of the cutter-bar which separated the grain. A harvesting machine would not have worked properly without a divider, and Manny's defense knew this. However, to assure a win, Watson opted to use duplicity—he employed a model maker named William P. Woods to retrieve an older version of McCormick's reaper and alter it to be presented in court. Woods found a reaper in Virginia which was built in 1844, one year prior to McCormick's patent being granted. He had a blacksmith straighten the curved divider, knowing that the curved divider in Manny's reaper would not conflict with a straight one in McCormick's reaper. After using a salt and vinegar solution to add rust to where the blacksmith had worked to ensure the antiquity of the machine was undeniable, Woods sent the reaper to Cincinnati. Stanton was joyed when he examined the altered reaper, and knew the case was theirs. Arguments for the case began on September 1855. In March 1856, Justices John McLean and Thomas Drummond delivered a ruling in favor of John Manny. McCormick appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, and McCormick v. Manny, <b>was,</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> a sudden, a political issue, and the matters concerning the case {{found their way to}} the floor of Congress.|$|E

500|$|All {{three of}} the {{airframe}} proposals shared a number of features. As the CX-HLS needed {{to be able to}} be loaded from the front, a door had to be included where the cockpit usually <b>was.</b> <b>All</b> <b>of</b> the companies solved this problem by moving the cockpit above the cargo area; Douglas had a small [...] "pod" [...] just forward and above the wing, Lockheed used a long [...] "spine" [...] running the length of the aircraft with the wing spar passing through it, while Boeing blended the two, with a longer pod that ran from just behind the nose to just behind the wing. In 1965 Lockheed's aircraft design and General Electric's engine design were selected for the new C-5 Galaxy transport, which was the largest military aircraft in the world at the time. The nose door and raised cockpit concepts would be carried over to the design of the 747.|$|E

500|$|When Rhodes was {{involved}} in matches, Cardus believed that [...] "he {{was not a man}} given to affability", showing annoyance on the field and being critical of the performances of others. According to historian Anthony Woodhouse, Rhodes was a [...] "dour, methodical and calculating cricketer." [...] Not popular in the way that a player like Hirst was popular, Rhodes [...] "commanded respect rather than plaudits" [...] in the words of Bowes. An introvert, he did not always get along with the more extrovert Hirst, possibly owing to mutual jealousy and some of Hirst's jocular comments, and was rarely pictured smiling. However, Rhodes became more relaxed and approachable in later life, particularly after his eyesight failed. Cardus was surprised, after meeting him in 1950, at how much more readily Rhodes engaged in conversation, commenting that [...] "history comes from his mouth in rivers". His obituary in The Times concluded: [...] "Gruff or mellow, he <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> a piece, a fighting Yorkshireman, superbly gifted." ...|$|E
500|$|The Professor Layton {{series was}} envisioned as a trilogy, to be {{completed}} {{with the release of}} the third game, Professor Layton and the Unwound Future.

In March 2009, Akihiro Hino officially unveiled Professor Layton and the Last Specter in Famitsu, stating that, with the second season, each game would take longer to develop than before, to dispel beliefs that Professor Layton had not significantly changed with each passing game. The second season of the series was also scheduled to have animated movies that take place between the games, starting with Professor Layton and the Eternal Diva, which was announced alongside Last Specter.|$|E

Ledger met Gilliam in November 2002 when Nicola Pecorini recommended the actor to the director, comparing him to Depp. Gilliam intended to cast Ledger opposite Depp. Damon and Ledger were originally cast in opposite roles before they petitioned to have their characters switched. Damon had {{wanted to work with}} Gilliam for years and actively campaigned to land the role of Will Grimm. The actor [...] "grew up loving [...] Time Bandits, the way that movie created this weird but totally convincing world". Gilliam elected to have Damon wear a prosthetic nose, but Weinstein said [...] "it would have distracted audiences from Damon's star-studded good looks". Gilliam later reasoned that [...] "it would have been the most expensive nose job ever".|$|E

500|$|... "I See You" [...] is a pop ballad, which {{lasts for}} a {{duration}} of four minutes and 20 seconds. It was composed {{in the key}} of A minor using common time and a slow groove at 72beats per minute. Lewis' vocal range spans two octaves, from the low note of F3 to the high note of F5, on the song. Ben Child for The Guardian likened the lyrics [...] "I offer {{my life as a}} sacrifice and live through your love" [...] to those performed by Dion in [...] "My Heart Will Go On". The lyrics are about encouraging a person to open their eyes and envisage a new and different world, and develop a new way of thinking. According to Lewis, the inspiration behind the song <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the emotion, love and strength that is displayed by the characters in the film. [...] "I See You" [...] garnered a mixed response from music critics. Brian Linder for IGN praised Horner for asking Lewis to perform [...] "I See You", describing her as a [...] "vocal powerhouse," [...] but was unsure if the song would manage to achieve the same success as Dion's [...] "My Heart Will Go On".
