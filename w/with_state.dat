5|$|Hitler took a {{personal}} interest in architecture and worked closely <b>with</b> <b>state</b> architects Paul Troost and Albert Speer to create public buildings in a neoclassical style based on Roman architecture.

5|$|In 1963, the Washington State Legislature {{commissioned}} {{a new state}} highway numbering system to ease confusion over similarly-numbered routes. The new system debuted in 1964, initially <b>with</b> <b>State</b> Route522 (SR522) assigned to the branch of Primary State Highway 2 from Seattle to North Bend, and State Route202 (SR202) assigned to the branch of Primary State Highway 15 from Woodinville to Monroe. By 1970, SR522 had been moved to the Bothell–Monroe Cutoff, while SR202 {{was moved to the}} Woodinville–North Bend highway.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, Washington {{unveiled}} a new numbering system for highways. Concurrencies <b>with</b> <b>state</b> primary state highways would be repealed in 1970 and US410 {{would be a}} non-concurrent highway. On June20, 1967, US12 was extended west from Lewiston, Idaho, over White Pass to Aberdeen, eliminating most of the original route of the highway. The remaining sections were split amongst other routes. The segment from Elma to Olympia became State Route8 (SR8). Interstate5 (I-5) took the Olympia–Tacoma segment, and the Tacoma–Naches segment became SR410. The last reassurance markers for US410 were taken down by December 1967.|$|E

While Mill Brook curves around the western extents of the village of Oxford, NY220 serves the village directly, entering it on Butler Street. It veers eastward at a junction <b>with</b> <b>State</b> Street and follows it to Washington Avenue. Here, State Street splits into a one-block long one-way couplet. Eastbound NY220 shifts south to follow LaFayette Park; NY220 westbound, meanwhile, is routed on State Street.
