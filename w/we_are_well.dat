I’m curious about how you are, how your health is. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>well</b> and plan {{to go to the}} camp. Today is a {{gorgeous}} day, we are in the best of spirits and have great hopes for the future…Don’t worry, girl, it’ll be fine. Be brave, stay well. Warm regards from my entire family and our Bernhard.|$|E
500|$|It was {{reported}} that the runway at Ouani Airport close to Mutsamudu was blocked with baggage trolleys and the atmosphere was tense as the island braced itself for the impending assault. [...] Before the telephone lines were cut an Anjouan government spokesperson was quoted as saying: [...] "They have decided to kill {{but we are not}} afraid. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>well</b> prepared. Our forces are ready and it's going to work!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{vote was}} 149–145 for {{extending}} the military deployment. Following the vote, Harper shook Ignatieff's hand. In a subsequent campaign appearance, Ignatieff reiterated {{his view of}} the mission in Afghanistan. He stated: [...] "the thing that Canadians have to understand about Afghanistan is that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>well</b> past the era of Pearsonian peacekeeping." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{the verdict}} her mother made a public plea: [...] "We are sending our plea to the British {{government}} and the victims of Lockerbie. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>well</b> aware the issue is painful to all, but {{in the name of}} the most humane of the professions we ask them to be merciful and let Megrahi go.", referring to Abdelbaset al-Megrahi who was serving a life sentence in Scotland for the Lockerbie bombing.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the crash}} of the second prototype, a company {{spokesman}} stated that all the details about the program's future were under review by the company. On 25 March 2009 Cessna CEO Jack Pelton confirmed that the 162 program would continue, saying: [...] "The need for a modern, cost-effective two-seat trainer aircraft has never been greater, and we believe <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>well</b> positioned to meet that need. The Skycatcher program {{is an important part of}} our strategy." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>well</b> {{informed}} about {{this type of}} gold currency, which was called [...] "gold sho" [...] (Tibetan: gser sho) because officials of finance of the new Tibetan government received tax payments {{in the form of}} these small gold ingots. The officials had to convert these into the current monetary standard. In order to assess the fineness of these pieces one used a standardized gold weight unit, which was referred to as Sewa (Tibetan: se ba) The following types of gold pieces are recorded in lists of the finance officials: ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1908, Michael {{published}} a novel, Never Say Die, about a morganatic marriage, written in resentment at not being allowed back into Russia. In the preface he wrote: [...] "Belonging, as I do, to the Imperial Blood, {{and being a}} member of one of the reigning houses, I should like to prove to the world how wrong it is in thinking - as the majority of mankind is apt to do - that we are the happiest beings on this earth. There is no doubt that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>well</b> situated, but is wealth the only happiness in the world?" [...] While remaining [...] "devoted" [...] to Sophie, Michael nevertheless often fell in love with pretty girls.|$|E
2500|$|In 2014, {{a letter}} from 52 leading skeptics was {{published}} by the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry supporting the scientific consensus and asking the media to stop referring to deniers as [...] "skeptics." [...] The letter clarified the skeptical opinion on climate and denial: [...] "As scientific skeptics, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>well</b> aware of political efforts to undermine climate science by those who deny reality but do not engage in scientific research or consider evidence that their deeply held opinions are wrong. The most appropriate word to describe {{the behavior of those}} individuals is 'denial'. Not all individuals who call themselves climate change skeptics are deniers. But virtually all deniers have falsely branded themselves as skeptics. By perpetrating this misnomer, journalists have granted undeserved credibility to those who reject science and scientific inquiry." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rabbah {{interpreted}} [...] {{to report}} that Caleb won the people over with his words, for he saw that when Joshua began to address them, they disparaged Joshua for failing to have children. So Caleb took a different tack and asked, [...] "Is this all that Amram's son [...] has done to us?" [...] And as they thought that Caleb was about to disparage Moses, they fell silent. Then Caleb said, [...] "He brought us out of Egypt, divided the sea, and fed us manna. If he were to ask us to get ladders and climb to heaven, should we not obey? And then Caleb said the words reported in [...] "We should go up at once, and possess the land, for <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>well</b> able to overcome it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Day {{turned in}} a {{generally}} weak performance during the campaign that did little to allay media concerns about his socially-conservative views. A particular campaign stunt that attracted much attention occurred, when Warren Kinsella, often known as Chrétien's [...] "attack dog", went on the Canada A.M TV show with a stuffed Barney dinosaur doll to mock's Day's purported belief that dinosaurs and humans once co-existed, saying that: [...] "I just want to remind Mr. Day that The Flintstones was not a documentary. And {{this is the only}} dinosaur that recently co-existed with humans" [...] while holding up the Barney doll. After the [...] "Barney moment", Kinsella's debating partner, Tim Powers of the Alliance is said to have remarked to Kinsella: [...] "We're fucked. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>well</b> and truly fucked". Kinsella had gotten the idea for the Barney stunt after a meeting with Chrétien's close associate Jean Carle to discuss a documentary about Day where several people claimed that Day had given a speech in 1997 where he was alleged to have stated his belief that humans and dinosaurs had co-existed. According to Kinsella, Chrétien phoned him to congratulate him on the Barney stunt, and found it so funny that he asked Kinsella to repeat his retelling of the [...] "Barney moment" [...] several times. The Barney stunt was part of a gambit by Kinsella to win NDP voters for the Liberals as Kinsella believed if New Democratic voters could be convinced that Day was a [...] "crazy" [...] Protestant fundamentalist fanatic, then they would vote for the Liberals as the best party to stop Day rather risk Vote splitting on the left. The New Democrats and Bloc Québécois also ran lacklustre campaigns, while the Progressive Conservatives, led by former Prime Minister Joe Clark, struggled to retain official party status. The relentless Grit attacks meant to demonize the Alliance as a gang of crazed right-wingers with a [...] "hidden agenda" [...] had the effect of causing many New Democratic voters to support the Liberals as the best party to stop the Alliance. The Liberals secured a strong majority mandate in the 2000 election, winning nearly as many seats as they had in 1993, largely thanks to significant gains in Quebec and in Atlantic Canada. Without Jean Charest as leader, the Tories who had done well in winning the popular vote in Quebec in 1997 fared poorly in 2000, and most of their voters defected over to the Liberals. Many voters in English Canada expressed the view that they had voted Liberal less of affection for the [...] "natural governing party" [...] than because the alternative in the form of Day was so much more worse. The fact that Martin attracted more enthusiasm from the public on the campaign trail than did Chrétien was much noticed within the Liberal Party.|$|E
