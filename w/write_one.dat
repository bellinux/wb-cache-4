5|$|The series began {{development}} in January 2007. HBO acquired the TV {{rights to the}} novels, with Benioff and Weiss as its executive producers, and Martin as a co-executive producer. The intention was for each novel to yield a season's worth of episodes. Initially, Martin would <b>write</b> <b>one</b> episode per season while Benioff and Weiss would write {{the rest of the}} episodes. Jane Espenson and Bryan Cogman were later added to <b>write</b> <b>one</b> episode apiece the first season.|$|E
5|$|In Falls the Shadow (1988) Penman {{chronicles the}} family {{relationships}} of King Henry III and his brother-in-law Simon de Montfort. Falls the Shadow is a bridge novel as Penman uses the Simon de Montfort rebellion to lead {{her to the}} conclusion of the trilogy in The Reckoning. As Penman explains: '“After I’d finished Here Be Dragons, I knew I wanted to continue the story… At first I’d planned to <b>write</b> <b>one</b> book in which Simon de Montfort would share top billing with Llewelyn Fawr’s grandson, Llewelyn ap Gruffydd, who later wed Simon’s daughter. I soon realized, though, that this was too much to tackle in one book, that Simon and Llewelyn each deserved his own novel. So I decided to devote Falls the Shadow to Simon and The Reckoning to Llewelyn".|$|E
50|$|Series creator Matthew Weiner {{also served}} as showrunner and {{executive}} producer, and is credited as a writer on 12 of the 13 episodes of the season, often co-writing the episodes with another writer.

5|$|The Audubon Naturalist Society also {{actively}} opposed such spraying programs, and recruited Carson to {{help make}} public the government's exact spraying practices and the related research. Carson began the four-year project of what would become Silent Spring by gathering examples of environmental damage attributed to DDT. She also attempted to enlist others to join the cause: essayist E. B. White, {{and a number of}} journalists and scientists. By 1958, Carson had arranged a book deal, with plans to co-write with Newsweek science journalist Edwin Diamond. However, when The New Yorker commissioned a long and well-paid article on the topic from Carson, she began considering writing more than simply the introduction and conclusion as planned; soon it was a solo project. (Diamond would later <b>write</b> <b>one</b> of the harshest critiques of Silent Spring).|$|E
5|$|Carter {{also served}} as {{executive}} producer and showrunner and wrote seven episodes. Co-executive producers and writing team Glen Morgan and James Wong wrote five episodes for their final season as regular writers for the series, although they would both return as consulting producers for part of season four. Supervising producer Howard Gordon wrote five episodes. Frank Spotnitz joined the series, writing two episodes. Cast member David Duchovny collaborated with Carter for two episodes receiving story credit. Glen Morgan's younger brother Darin Morgan joined the series, contributing the story for an episode written by his older brother and James Wong, and writing another script solo. Paul Brown joined the series as a producer and wrote two episodes. Sara B. Charno, another staff writer, wrote two episodes. Vince Gilligan joined the series, writing one episode. Former supervising producer Alex Gansa returned to co-wrote one episode with writing partner Howard Gordon. Chris Ruppenthal returned to <b>write</b> <b>one</b> more freelance episode after last season. Steve De Jarnatt also contributed one freelance episode for the season. Line producer and production manager Joseph Patrick Finn was promoted to producer with this season. Paul Rabwin continued to serve as co-producer for the show.|$|E
5|$|Arnold {{returned}} to {{working on the}} hydrogen bomb book, but 1987 was the 30th anniversary of the Windscale accident. Rather than let {{the records of the}} accident and subsequent inquiries be released over several years, Arnold persuaded the Public Records Office to release them all at once. In meetings with the various responsible government agencies, the topic of a book about Windscale came up, and Arnold decided to <b>write</b> <b>one,</b> which became Windscale 1957: Anatomy of a Nuclear Accident in 1992. Gowing, in poor health, retired from the UKAEA in 1993. By this time her two research assistants had also left, and Arnold feared that the UKAEA Council would shut down the hydrogen bomb book project, which she hoped to follow up with one on the UK civil nuclear power programme. The UKAEA Council decided to press on with the project, asking Arnold to stay on although she was now over seventy years old. In 1993, she was joined by Katherine Pyne, an aircraft engineer working on a history degree, who became her research assistant for two years. However, the end was in sight. The UKAEA no longer had responsibility for nuclear weapons, and management was not interested in it. With funds for the project almost exhausted, the UKAEA Council decided that Arnold should retire in 1996. She loaded her notes into her car and took them home. Sympathetic friends at the Ministry of Defence found some money to cover her expenses, and she doggedly worked on it from home. Britain and the H-Bomb finally appeared in 2001.|$|E

25|$|The 4477th {{pilots and}} {{tactical}} controllers were Aggressors, Fighter Weapons School or Top Gun instructors. Most were majors, a few captains, with 2000–3000 hours.

5|$|Chris Carter, {{who also}} served as {{executive}} producer and showrunner during the season, wrote or co-wrote {{the bulk of the}} episodes for the season, with nine of the twenty one episodes.

25|$|Kirby began {{planning}} his Introduction to Entomology, {{a celebrated}} title, in 1808. This was the practical {{result of a}} friendship formed in 1805 with William Spence, of Hull, and appeared in four volumes between 1815 and 1826. Much of the work fell to Kirby owing to Spence's ill health. The book was illustrated by John Curtis. It reached its seventh edition in 1856. In 1830 {{he was invited to}} <b>write</b> <b>one</b> of the Bridgewater Treatises, his subject being The History, Habits, and Instincts of Animals (2 vols., 1835).|$|E
25|$|The novel {{has proven}} to be a {{mainstay}} of Dutch literature: generations of Dutch schoolchildren have read it, and at the time of Haasse's death, in 2011, it had been reprinted more than fifty times. The novel was the centerpiece of a 2009 reading campaign organized by the Collectieve Propaganda van het Nederlandse Boek, a Dutch organization of book sellers and publishers. Haasse went on to <b>write</b> <b>one</b> further book focusing with the Indonesian archipelago, Krassen op een rots (Scratches on a Rock; 1969), which detailed a trip to post-independence Indonesia—particularly Java—and the archipelago also featured in her autobiographical works.|$|E
25|$|The 28 Kanak {{languages}} {{spoken in}} New Caledonia {{are part of}} the Oceanic group of the Austronesian family.

The four most widely spoken indigenous languages are Drehu (spoken in Lifou), Nengone (spoken on Maré) and Paicî (northern part of Grande Terre). Others include Iaai (spoken on Ouvéa). At the 2009 census, 35.8% of people aged 15 or older reported that they could speak (but not necessarily read or <b>write)</b> <b>one</b> of the indigenous Melanesian languages, whereas 58.7% reported that they had no knowledge of any of them.|$|E

25|$|Droste's {{earliest}} {{poems are}} derivative and conventional but in 1820 her work {{began to show}} marked originality when she embarked on a cycle of religious poems, Das geistliche Jahr ("The Spiritual Year"). Droste intended to <b>write</b> <b>one</b> poem for each Sunday and Feast Day of the church year and the cycle was meant to please her devout grandmother, but when Droste had completed 25 poems, she realised they were too personal and showed too many traces of spiritual doubt, so she shelved the work until 1839 when a friend persuaded her to complete the series. Even then she did not publish the poems and they were only offered to the public posthumously in 1851.|$|E
25|$|Women were {{generally}} confined to underground {{roles in the}} French Resistance network. Lucie Aubrac, who {{has become a symbol}} of the French Resistance within France, never had a clearly defined role in the hierarchy of the movement, which in her case involved the regional Southern Liberation. Hélène Viannay, more highly educated than her husband Philippe Viannay, the founder of the Défense de la France, did not <b>write</b> <b>one</b> single article for the clandestine newspaper of the same name, nor did the other companions of the chiefs of the Défense de la France, although they did take part in meetings to edit the newspaper. On the other hand, Suzanne Buisson, cofounder of the Comité d'action socialiste (CAS) was the treasurer until her arrest. Only one woman, Marie-Madeleine Fourcade, was a head of a network (by leading the British to believe that the true head of the Alliance network was actually a man). No woman ever led a movement, or a maquis (guerilla group) or a Liberation Committee, none was installed as a Commissioner within the Provisional Government of the Republic of France or a Minister of the Liberation.|$|E
25|$|On Christmas Eve in Manhattan's East Village, two roommates—Mark, a filmmaker, and Roger, a rock musician—struggle to {{stay warm}} and produce their art ("Tune Up #1"). Mark's mother leaves him a {{voicemail}} wishing him a merry Christmas and trying to comfort him since his ex-girlfriend Maureen dumped him ("Voice Mail #1"). Their friend Collins, a gay anarchist Ivy League tutor, calls and plans to surprise them at their apartment, but is mugged before entering. At the same time, Mark and Roger's former roommate Benny, who has since become their harsh new landlord, has reneged on an earlier agreement and now demands last year's rent, before shutting down their electrical power ("Tune Up #2"). However, Mark and Roger rebel and pledge to not pay the rent they were promised wouldn't be a problem ("Rent"). Meanwhile, a cross-dressing street drummer (currently out of drag) named Angel finds Collins wounded in an alley and tends to him ("You Okay Honey?"). The two are immediately attracted to each other, and learn that they are both HIV positive. Roger also has HIV which he contracted from his last girlfriend, who committed suicide, causing Roger to fall into a deep depression. Mark goes looking for Collins ("Tune Up #3"), while Roger wishes to <b>write</b> <b>one</b> last song to be remembered by before he dies ("One Song Glory"). An exotic dancer, junkie, and neighbor, Mimi, shows up to flirt with Roger, but he is clearly hesitant {{to start a new}} relationship ("Light My Candle"). Meanwhile, Joanne, a lawyer and Maureen's girlfriend, receives a voicemail from her parents ("Voice Mail #2").|$|E

[...] In a 2009 {{interview with}} HipHopDX, Bow Wow commented on how getting T.I. to ghostwrite for him on his third album didn't tarnish his credibility as a rapper, saying that he learned about the songwriting process by contributing about 85 percent to the album while T.I. wrote a full song and a couple verses to a few tracks.|$|E
