5|$|A large 2010 {{survey of}} healthy and CCD-affected colonies also {{revealed}} {{elevated levels of}} pesticides in <b>wax</b> <b>and</b> pollen, but the amounts of pesticides were similar in both failing and healthy hives. They also confirmed suspected links between CCD and poor colony health, inadequate diet, and long-distance transportation. Studies continue to show very high levels of pathogens in CCD-affected samples and lower pathogen levels in unaffected samples, consistent with the empirical observation that healthy honey bee colonies normally fend off pathogens. These observations {{have led to the}} hypothesis that bee declines are resulting from immune suppression.|$|E

The COW system circulates part of the cargo through the fixed tank-cleaning system to remove <b>wax</b> <b>and</b> asphaltic deposits. Tanks that carry less viscous cargoes are washed with water. Fixed and portable automated tank cleaning machines, which clean tanks with high-pressure water jets, are widely used. Some systems use rotating high-pressure water jets to spray hot water on all the internal surfaces of the tank. As the spraying takes place, the liquid is pumped out of the tank.|$|E

Researchers from Washington State University, under entomology professor Steve Sheppard in 2009, confirmed high levels of pesticide residue in hive <b>wax</b> <b>and</b> found an association between it and significantly reduced bee longevity.|$|E

5|$|Various {{substances}} {{have been}} used as shoe polish for hundreds of years, starting with natural substances such as <b>wax</b> <b>and</b> tallow. Modern polish formulas were introduced early in the 20th century and many of those original formulations are still in use today. Today, shoe polish is usually made from a mix of natural and synthetic materials, including naphtha, turpentine, dyes, and gum arabic, using straightforward chemical engineering processes. Shoe polish is usually flammable, can be toxic, and, if misused, can stain skin. It should be used in a well-ventilated area with care taken to protect clothes, carpet and furniture.|$|E
5|$|Wax {{resist dyeing}} of fabric {{is an ancient}} art form. It already existed in Egypt in the 4th century BC, where {{it was used to}} wrap mummies; linen was soaked in <b>wax,</b> <b>and</b> {{scratched}} using a stylus. In Asia, the technique was practised in China during the Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD), and in India and Japan during the Nara Period (645-794 AD). In Africa it was originally practised by the Yoruba tribe in Nigeria, Soninke and Wolof in Senegal. These African version however, uses cassava starch or rice paste, or mud as a resist instead of beeswax.|$|E
5|$|While other {{refineries}} {{would keep}} the 60% of oil product that became kerosene, but dump the other 40% in rivers and massive sludge piles, Rockefeller remained as thrifty and efficient as ever, using the gasoline to fuel the refinery, and selling the rest as lubricating oil, petroleum jelly and paraffin <b>wax,</b> <b>and</b> other by-products. Tar was used for paving, naphtha shipped to gas plants. Likewise, Rockefeller's refineries hired their own plumbers, cutting the cost of pipe-laying in half. Barrels that cost $2.50 each ended up only $.96 when Rockefeller bought the wood and had them built for himself.|$|E
