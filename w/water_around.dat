5|$|Each {{year during}} the warmer months of September through December, male banded sea kraits gather on land and in the <b>water</b> <b>around</b> gently sloping areas at high tide. Males prefer to mate with larger females because they produce larger and more offspring.|$|E
5|$|Each worm {{begins the}} round with a {{specific}} amount of health, which is predefined by the chosen game options or by scripting in campaign levels. When hit with a weapon, the worm will lose health depending upon {{the power of the}} weapon and the directness of the hit. A worm can be killed either by exploding after having its health reduced to zero or by being knocked into the <b>water</b> <b>around</b> and below the level.|$|E
5|$|Native Americans {{occupied}} the river valleys surrounding the Metacomet Ridge {{for at least}} 10,000 years. Major tribal groups active in the area included the Quinnipiac, Niantic, Pequot, Pocomtuc, and Mohegan. Traprock was used to make tools and arrowheads. Natives hunted game, gathered plants and fruits, and fished in local bodies of <b>water</b> <b>around</b> the Metacomet Ridge. Tracts of woodland in the river bottoms surrounding the ridges were sometimes burned to facilitate the cultivation of crops such as corn, squash, tobacco, and beans.|$|E

5|$|A 2006 {{study of}} inland bodies of <b>water</b> <b>around</b> Canberra where wedge-tailed eagles and white-bellied sea eagles share territories showed little overlap {{in the range}} of prey taken. Wedge-tailed eagles took rabbits, various macropods, {{terrestrial}} birds such as cockatoos and parrots, and various passerines including magpies and starlings. White-bellied sea eagles caught fish, water-dwelling reptiles such as the eastern long-necked turtle and Australian water dragon, and waterbirds such as ducks, grebes and coots. Both species preyed on the maned duck. Rabbits constituted {{only a small fraction of}} the white-bellied sea eagle's diet. Despite nesting near each other, the two species seldom interacted, as the wedge-tailed eagles hunted away from water and the white-bellied sea eagles foraged along the lake shores. However, conflict with wedge-tailed eagles over nesting sites in remnant trees has been recorded in Tasmania.|$|E
5|$|Although Disston's {{engineered}} canals aided {{water transport}} and steamboat traffic in Florida, he was ultimately unsuccessful in draining the Kissimmee River floodplain or lowering the surface <b>water</b> <b>around</b> Lake Okeechobee {{and in the}} Everglades. He was forced to sell much of his investments {{at a fraction of}} their original costs. However, his land purchase primed Florida's economy and allowed railroad magnates Henry Flagler and Henry Plant to build rail lines down the east coast of Florida, and another joining the west coast, which directly led to the domination of the tourist and citrus industries in Florida. Disston's immediate impact was in the Philadelphia area, where he was active in Republican politics and a philanthropist, but his legacy is often associated with the draining and development of Florida.|$|E
5|$|Although starfish do {{not have}} many {{well-defined}} sense organs, they are sensitive to touch, light, temperature, orientation {{and the status of}} the <b>water</b> <b>around</b> them. The tube feet, spines and pedicellariae are sensitive to touch. The tube feet, especially those at the tips of the rays, are also sensitive to chemicals, enabling the starfish to detect odour sources such as food. There are eyespots at the ends of the arms, each one made of 80–200 simple ocelli. These are composed of pigmented epithelial cells that respond to light and are covered by a thick, transparent cuticle that both protects the ocelli and acts to focus light. Many starfish also possess individual photoreceptor cells in other parts of their bodies and respond to light even when their eyespots are covered. Whether they advance or retreat depends on the species.|$|E

5|$|Before the New Waddell Dam was constructed, {{two phases}} of a {{three-phase}} study {{were carried out}} {{to determine the effects}} of the dam on fisheries. Completed in 2005, the third phase of the study determined that the larger reservoir has less nutrient concentrations due to CAP water introduction and that water fluctuations have reduced fish cover, likely affecting food and spawning. Large mouth bass populations have also declined but striped bass have entered the lake, likely by eggs transferred through CAP <b>water.</b> <b>Around</b> the lake, Reclamation has taken steps to protect wildlife habitats, including those for bald eagles and Gila topminnows.|$|E
5|$|Early on September 21, {{the motion}} {{shifted to the}} north as it moved along the {{northwest}} periphery of the subtropical ridge. That general motion continued throughout the day, however, Helene began to turn more northeastward that evening {{along the edge of}} the subtropical ridge, east of Bermuda. A decrease in wind shear and relatively warm <b>water</b> <b>around</b> 81°F (27°C) kept the intensity mostly stationary, keeping Helene as a Category1 hurricane. The intensity held around 80mph (130km/h) before strengthening slightly late on September 22, despite losing some tropical characteristics (it was operationally downgraded to a tropical storm for a brief period) as it accelerated northeast in the north Atlantic. A QuikSCAT analysis early on September 23 confirmed a high-end Category1 hurricane with 90mph (145km/h) winds.|$|E
5|$|For {{ten minutes}} after the {{explosion}} there was no firing; sailors from both sides were either too shocked by the blast or desperately extinguishing fires aboard their own ships to continue the fight. During the lull, Nelson gave orders that boats be sent to pull survivors from the <b>water</b> <b>around</b> the remains of Orient. At 22:10, Franklin restarted the engagement by firing on Swiftsure. Isolated and battered, Blanquet's ship was soon dismasted and the admiral, suffering a severe head wound, was forced to surrender by the combined firepower of Swiftsure and Defence. More than half of Franklins crew had been killed or wounded.|$|E

5|$|The {{moral code}} {{embedded}} in Aboriginal lore {{is evident in}} a story from an unspecified locality in eastern Australia (probably in New South Wales) published in 1943. An Aboriginal man, fishing in a lagoon, caught a baby bunyip. Instead of returning the baby to the water, {{he wanted to take}} the bunyip back to the camp to boast of his fishing prowess, against the urging of his friends. Before he could do anything, the mother bunyip rose from the water, flooding swirling <b>water</b> <b>around</b> them, and took back her baby. As the water receded, the men found that they had been changed into black swans. As punishment for the fisherman's vanity, they never regained their human form, but could be heard at night talking in human voices as a reminder to their human relatives of the perils of pride and arrogance.|$|E
5|$|Walruses live {{to about}} 20–30 {{years old in}} the wild. The males reach sexual {{maturity}} as early as seven years, but do not typically mate until fully developed at around 15 years of age. They rut from January through April, decreasing their food intake dramatically. The females begin ovulating as soon as four to six years old. The females are polyestrous, coming into heat in late summer and also around February, yet the males are fertile only around February; the potential fertility of this second period is unknown. Breeding occurs from January to March, peaking in February. Males aggregate in the <b>water</b> <b>around</b> ice-bound groups of estrous females and engage in competitive vocal displays. The females join them and copulate in the water.|$|E
5|$|With {{global warming}} causing glaciers and {{permafrost}} to melt rapidly and allowing {{a large amount}} of fresh water to flow into the oceans, there are concerns that if the amount of fresh water in the oceans reaches a critical point, there will be a disruption in the thermohaline circulation. Considering the blue whale's migratory patterns are based on ocean temperature, a disruption in this circulation, which moves warm and cold <b>water</b> <b>around</b> the world, would be likely to have an effect on their migration. The whales summer in the cool, high latitudes, where they feed in krill-abundant waters; they winter in warmer, low latitudes, where they mate and give birth.|$|E

5|$|Hyderabad {{produces}} around 4,500tonnes {{of solid}} waste daily, which is transported from collection units in Imlibun, Yousufguda and Lower Tank Bund to the dumpsite in Jawaharnagar. Disposal is managed by the Integrated Solid Waste Management project which was started by the GHMC in 2010. Rapid urbanisation and increased economic activity has also led to increased industrial waste, air, noise and water pollution, which is regulated by the Telangana Pollution Control Board (TPCB). The contribution of different sources to air pollution in 2006 was: 20–50% from vehicles, 40–70% {{from a combination of}} vehicle discharge and road dust, 10–30% from industrial discharges and 3–10% from the burning of household rubbish. Deaths resulting from atmospheric particulate matter are estimated at 1,700–3,000 each year. Ground <b>water</b> <b>around</b> Hyderabad, which has a hardness of up to 1000 ppm, around three times higher than is desirable, is the main source of drinking water but the increasing population and consequent increase in demand has led to a decline in not only ground water but also river and lake levels. This shortage is further exacerbated by inadequately treated effluent discharged from industrial treatment plants polluting the water sources of the city.|$|E
5|$|If {{the player}} plays as the Kid, Sara is trapped in LeMU instead of Coco; the Kid {{frequently}} has visions of Coco, {{but no one}} else sees her. The group manages to contact the surface, and open and close doors to various rooms in LeMU to move the <b>water</b> <b>around,</b> allowing them to escape. After having played the game as both Takeshi and the Kid, the player accesses the final route, in which it is revealed that while the events Takeshi experienced took place in 2017, those the Kid experienced were a recreation, and took place in a rebuilt LeMU in 2034. The You of 2017, whose full first name is Yubiseiharukana, had artificially impregnated herself and given birth to Yubiseiakikana, who took the role of You during the recreation. Pipi had escaped LeMU in 2017, carrying with it the disk with Sora's memories and footage of Coco being trapped in IBF. Sara and the Kid are revealed to be Tsugumi and Takeshi's children, and the Kid's real name turns out to be Hokuto. The Kid of 2017, whose name is Ryogo Kaburaki, played the role of Takeshi during the recreation, having stopped aging due to the Cure virus.|$|E
5|$|Karl {{originated}} {{in a strong}} tropical wave that moved {{off the coast of}} Africa on September 13. The wave gradually became better organized, and it was declared Tropical Depression Twelve about 670miles (1,080km) west-southwest of the Cape Verde islands on the morning of September 16, as it headed westward in the open tropical Atlantic following the periphery of the subtropical ridge. That afternoon, the depression continued to rapidly organize and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Karl. Due to healthy outflow around an upper-level anticyclone over Karl and a favorable environment with the warmest sea surface temperatures of the year, rapid deepening began on the evening of September 17, with the storm developing a small eye and being upgraded to Hurricane Karl. With <b>water</b> <b>around</b> 28°C (83°F) and low wind shear, the cyclone continued to rapidly intensify on the morning of September 18. The intensity leveled off somewhat that afternoon as a strong Category2 hurricane with winds of 110mph (175km/h).|$|E

5|$|Ghats (stone steps laid on {{a gradual}} bank slope to descend {{to the lake}} edge) at Pushkar are {{integral}} to the lake. Ghats are also used for sacred bathing and rites, such as ancestor worship. Out of 52 ghats used by pilgrims to take a holy bath in the lake, ten important ghats {{on the periphery of}} the lake, which have other contiguous ghats adjoining them, have also been declared as 'Monuments of National Importance'. These ghats are: the Varaha Ghat, the Dadhich Ghat, Saptarishi Ghats, Gwalior Ghat, Kota Ghat, Gau ghat, Yag Ghat, Jaipur Ghat, Karni Ghat and Gangaur Ghat. These ghats as well as the sacred Pushkar Lake (which is also a declared heritage monument) have been refurbished over the centuries by the Royal families of Rajasthan and by the Maratha kings. These are now undergoing further works as part of a heritage improvement programme launched with funds provided by the Government of Rajasthan and several departments of the Government of India. There are strict codes to be followed while taking a bath in the ghats, such as removing shoes away from the ghats and avoiding the passing of unwarranted comments about Hindu religious beliefs by non-Hindus, since the ghats and the temples are linked to the divine lake. The sacred water of the lake is said to be curative of many skin diseases. Local belief is that <b>water</b> <b>around</b> each ghat has a special curative power. While many ghats have been named after the Rajas who built them, some ghats have particular importance. Varaha ghat is so named since Vishnu appeared here in his incarnation of a boar (Varaha). Brahma Ghat is so named since Brahma bathed here. The Gau Ghat was renamed as Gandhi Ghat after Mahatma Gandhi's ashes were immersed at this ghat. Nart Singh Ghat, close to Varaha Ghat, has a stuffed crocodile on display.|$|E
5|$|The {{success at}} Beersheba {{significantly}} reduced Ottoman resistance, but heavy fighting continued around Gaza and elsewhere, including the Battle of Tel el Khuweilfe, and the regiment remained at Beersheba {{for four days}} to receive remounts. Gaza fell in early November and, as Ottoman forces fell back, the British Empire troops followed them in pursuit. The 12th advanced further into Palestine {{as part of the}} plan to capture Jerusalem. On 7 November, during the Battle of Hareira and Sheria, the regiment joined the 11th Light Horse Regiment in an attack in support of the 60th Division around Khurbet Buteihah, but was forced to halt their charge and dismount amidst artillery and machine-gun fire as their horses needed water. The following day, the 12th was sent to Beit Hanun to contact the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade, before searching for <b>water</b> <b>around</b> Sin Sin and Faluje, where they captured a number of Ottoman troops before rejoining the Australian Mounted Division at Huj. On 10 November, the 12th provided support to the 11th Light Horse Regiment when they came under attack at Hill 248 by a strong Ottoman counterattack, which was turned back. After moving on to Summeil the next day, one of the regiment's squadrons received heavy fire while providing flank protection to the 54th Division as it attacked to the south of Et Tine.|$|E
