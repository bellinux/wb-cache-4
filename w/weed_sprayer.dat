40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} trajectory tracking in crops by a <b>weed</b> <b>sprayer</b> mobile robot (WSMR). This problem arises because to fumigate, the robot must follow a predefined path and avoid any obstacles it may encounter. To achieve both trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance, a control scheme based on different behaviours is proposed, which consists essentially of an adaptive controller with a reference model for trajectory tracking and a fuzzy reactive for obstacle avoidance. Each of these controllers is executed according to {{the selection of the}} fuzzy behaviour controller, which uses information delivered by anti-collision sensors located on the robot. As a result of the implementation of this behaviour-based architecture and by means of computer simulations and experimental laboratory tests, the WSMR demonstrates the capability of autonomously following a desired trajectory between the rows of a crop in the presence of obstacles. The results are evaluated by taking into account trajectory tracking curves and the operating requirements of each controller, as well as the application of different errors indices for quantitatively evaluating the proposed control scheme...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{computer vision system}} that successfully discriminates between weed patches and crop rows under uncontrolled lighting in real-time. The system consists of two independent subsystems, a fast image processing delivering results in real-time (Fast Image Processing, FIP), and a slower and more accurate processing (Robust Crop Row Detection, RCRD) {{that is used to}} correct the first subsystem's mistakes. This combination produces a system that achieves very good results under a wide variety of conditions. Tested on several maize videos taken of different fields and during different years, the system successfully detects an average of 95 % of weeds and 80 % of crops under different illumination, soil humidity and weed/crop growth conditions. Moreover, the system has been shown to produce acceptable results even under very difficult conditions, such as in the presence of dramatic sowing errors or abrupt camera movements. The computer vision system has been developed for integration into a treatment system because the ideal setup for any <b>weed</b> <b>sprayer</b> system would include a tool that could provide information on the weeds and crops present at each point in real-time, while the tractor mounting the spraying bar is movin...|$|E

40|$|An optical <b>weed</b> sensing <b>sprayer</b> (WeedSeeker) was {{evaluated}} for making postemergence glyphosate herbicide applications in a Yuma, AZ lemon orchard. In addition, mechanical (disk and Perfecta cultivator) and {{chemical weed control}} strategies were compared. Results were fairly similar; however, {{the use of the}} WeedSeeker units combined with a preemergence herbicide (H 1) increased weed control three fold compared to disking (D) and perfecta (P 1). Additionally, when the WeedSeeker units were used in conjunction with preemergence herbicides, spray volume was reduced by 66 % compared to a conventional sprayer and by 57 % when used for postemergence applications only. There was a relationship between weed ground cover and the area sprayed by the WeedSeeker units indicating that maximum postemergence herbicide savings will occur at low weed densities or less than 10 % groundcover. The use of a sprayer with an improved suspension system allowed for faster spraying speeds than were possible with the tractor mounted <b>sprayer.</b> <b>Weed</b> control was similar for the conventional and the WeedSeeker sprayer. However, yields were variable for both years. Future investigations will include efforts to develop crop budgets based on experimental operation...|$|R

40|$|A {{survey of}} 77 growers, mainly in Hawkes Bay and Nelson, was {{undertaken}} {{during the summer}} of 1989 / 90. Personal interviews were conducted on each property. All growers were found to use herbicides for weed control, and all but one established herbicide strips with mown grass between. The major herbicide application period was spring. Three-quarters of growers relied on four herbicide formulations, amitrole, glyphosate, simazine and terbuthylazine/terbumeton. Of the residual herbicides used, 70 % were triazines. Grower knowledge about herbicides was found to be lacking. Grass species from the sub-family Paniceae were found to be the most problematic weeds, along with mallows, black nightshade, Californian thistle, tall willow herb and docks. These weeds were not adequately controlled by current weed control practices. Off-label use and herbicide damage to crop trees was noted. Growers were found to be applying herbicides through a wide array of equipment, through fan and off-centre nozzles with one to four nozzles on each boom. Only 37 % of sprayers were calibrated at least annually. During the survey 41 sprayers were calibrated, with only 17 % being correct within ± 5 % of intended application rate. Of those sprayers with errors over ± 5 % two-thirds were underapplying at mean error of 37 %, and one-third were overapplying at a mean error of 18. 1 %. Spray distribution patterns were found to be unacceptably uneven across the herbicide strip in most cases. Over 40 % of growers were not able to relate the actual amount of herbicide used to a target application rate per hectare. A lack of training in both chemical use for <b>weed</b> control and <b>sprayer</b> calibration was apparent, and 80 % of growers saw a need for a field manual.

40|$|The University of Southern Queensland {{along with}} other centre’s {{around the world are}} at the leading edge of fibre {{composite}} research. Many studies have been conducted into the properties and applications of fibre composite and it is the purpose of the research project to apply these findings to a real world design problem. This project aims to analyse and redesign the current SprayCam rig. SprayCam is a selective weed spot spraying system used within the agricultural industry. This technology uses a series of cameras operating in the visual spectrum to identify the weeds within fallowed paddocks. These cameras operate solenoids which subsequently spray only the weeds and not the entire field which occurs during conventional spraying techniques. The SprayCam rig is the mechanism that supports the cameras and the other technology and allows them to operate safely and efficiently. The current design is large and heavy for both its size and also its intended use as a selective <b>weed</b> spot <b>sprayer.</b> It is the belief that the current design overuses materials leading to an over engineered product which also increases manufacturing cost. This project contains two essential facets, the first being the analysis of the current rig design to determine the structural integrity while the second is to investigate the use of fibre composite pultrusions as a means of redesigning the spray rig wing. In order to complete the analysis of the current SprayCam rig it was first necessary to re-produce solid models of the current wing design to create an accurate basis for finite element analysis (FEA). Considerable research was directed into the appropriate loading constraints which have been identified and discussed in full within the report to ensure the validity of the results. A thorough finite element analysis was conducted on current spray rig design which found that the original wing was indeed over engineered for its use as an agricultural sprayer. The loads which the rig could withstand were much greater than those which it will be subjected to within the field. This result shows an inefficiency of the use of materials within the wing design leading to increased manufacturing cost. Therefore a more appropriate design needs to be developed if the product is going to be competitive in the current market. In redesigning the spray rig, investigation of all possible avenues would have required significant time and effort. With the University of Southern Queensland at the leading edge of fibre composite research, it was agreed that fibre composite pultrusions would be investigated as a means of both significantly reducing the weight of the spray rig and overcoming existing design flaws. There is currently a great deal of research conducted into the properties of fibre composite pultrusions and it is the purpose of this project to apply this research to a design situation. Many issues including costing and joining techniques needed to be overcome so that a possible design could be completed. Through use of finite element analysis {{it has been shown that}} fibre composite pultrusions are a feasible alternative to the original steel design. Significant weight savings have been shown to be a possibility with only a minimal increase in cost. ...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this research project {{is to develop a}} system for precision spraying of herbicides in a corn field. Ultimately, such a system would permit real-time image collection, processing, weed identification, mapping of <b>weed</b> density and <b>sprayer</b> control using a tractor-mounted digital camera and on-board computer. The initial hypotheses underlying this project were (1) {{that it is possible to}} train an artificial neural network (ANN) to distinguish weeds from a crop species (corn in this study); (2) that it is possible to differentiate between weed species; and (3) that precision spraying can significantly reduce the quantity of herbicide needed to protect crop yields, thus reducing both the costs and environmental impacts of such applications. Thus, development of an ANN for this purpose was the main focus of the research project. Since the success of ANN development is primarily dependent on the type of information that it is provided, much of the work involved investigation of different approaches to extracting information from the digital images of field sections and individual objects (weeds or corn plants), as well as analysis of the type of information extracted. The applicability of a given image processing method was evaluated in terms of the image recognition accuracy, as well as the computer time and memory requirements for processing and obtaining ANN output, since speed is of the essence in real-time applications. The greenness method based on a pixel-by-pixel analysis of red-green-blue intensity value of the original images was the most successful and was used in further work. As it turned out, ANN development for this purpose was difficult. While the success rate for recognition of corn plants was high (80 % or greater), the success rate for recognition of weeds tended to be low. Improvements in weed recognition were met with decreases in the success rate of corn recognition. Differentiation between weed species was less than desirable. Differentiation between corn and a given weed species was also not as good, particularly when the weed species was similar in appearance to the young corn plant. Therefore, another strategy was developed to recognize weeds in the field by taking images between the corn rows. Previously, the images were taken randomly in the field. The images were processed to obtain percent greenness in each image and this information was used to create weed coverage and weed patchiness maps. Based on these maps, herbicide spraying was decided and spraying amounts were determined. In terms of real-time, it was possible to process the equivalent of one metre of row per second. Although this is slow compared to tractor speed in the field, the computer was not operating under dedicated conditions as one would require for the real-time application. Thus, the results were considered encouraging. The final stage of the work involved an evaluation of the potential herbicide savings from a precision spraying system. This was done by using the weed coverage and weed patchiness maps as inputs to a simulated fuzzy logic controller, and integrating the output of the controller over the field area corresponding to the input images. The simulations with different fuzzy rules and membership functions indicated that the precision spraying approach could reduce the amount of herbicide needed for weed control in a corn field by up to 15 %...|$|R
