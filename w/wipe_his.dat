5|$|On January 27, 2009, at {{a public}} sendoff in Phoenix for the Arizona Cardinals before they faced the Steelers in Super Bowl XLIII, Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon {{produced}} a towel and called the Cardinals mascot, Big Red to the stage, where he used the towel to <b>wipe</b> <b>his</b> armpits. Gordon then blew his nose on the towel. The Cardinals then proceeded to lose the Super Bowl to the Steelers, 27-23.|$|E
5|$|In April 1948 he {{once again}} {{travelled}} with England to Hampden Park, helping his country to a 2–0 victory; however after the match {{he was the}} subject of an FA inquiry after he claimed tea and scones on his expenses (at the cost of sixpence). Regardless of this treatment by the FA, the next month he helped England record a 4–0 victory over Italy in Turin. Folklore told that he beat Alberto Eliani only to have the audacity to then pull a comb from his shorts pocket and comb his hair; the reality was that he simply used his hand to <b>wipe</b> <b>his</b> sweating brow in the beating Italian sun. However the legend would follow him around the world in later life, and spectators in the crowd were convinced that they had witnessed it. Later in the year he played in a goalless draw with Denmark, a 6–2 win over Northern Ireland, a 1–0 win over Wales, and a 6–0 triumph over Switzerland.|$|E
25|$|One {{version of}} his death states when found he still had his wiping cloth tucked through his {{buttonhole}} and under his safety harness; as it was his habit to <b>wipe</b> <b>his</b> goggles clean going into battle, it was deduced he had been caught unaware.|$|E

25|$|There is no {{reference}} to the legendary Veronica in the Gospels, but sources such as Acta Sanctorum describe her as a pious woman of Jerusalem who, moved with pity as Jesus carried his cross to Golgotha, gave him her veil that he might <b>wipe</b> <b>his</b> forehead.|$|E
25|$|Quesada {{was at the}} {{controls}} and flew the aircraft over the ocean for calmer air. Fearing that chemical burns from the gasoline might force him to parachute from the airplane to seek medical treatment, Spaatz ordered Eaker to continue the flight regardless. However, Spaatz shed all his clothing and was wiped off with oil-soaked rags. Although he directed at least one refueling without his clothing, replacements were soon delivered. Quesada was briefly overcome by the same accident but quickly revived. Spaatz experienced two other fuel spills without injury, using oil to <b>wipe</b> <b>his</b> skin and zinc oxide to protect his eyes.|$|E
25|$|Margaret attacks York's castle at Wakefield, and the Yorkists {{lose the}} ensuing battle. During the conflict, Clifford murders York's twelve-year-old son, Rutland. Margaret and Clifford then capture and taunt York himself; {{forcing him to}} stand on a molehill, they give him a {{handkerchief}} covered with Rutland's blood to <b>wipe</b> <b>his</b> brow, and place a paper crown on his head, before stabbing him to death. After the battle, as Edward and Richard lament York's death, Warwick brings news that his own army has been defeated by Margaret's at the Second Battle of St Albans, and the King has returned to London, where, under pressure from Margaret, he has revoked his agreement with York. However, George Plantagenet, Richard and Edward's brother, has vowed to join their cause, having been encouraged {{to do so by}} his sister, the Duchess of Burgundy. Additionally, Warwick has been joined in the conflict by his own younger brother, Montague.|$|E

500|$|In the {{controversial}} 2007 video game, Manhunt 2, the main protagonist, Daniel Lamb, has been brainwashed {{and had his}} mind toyed with by 'The Project'. The failsafe phrase to <b>wipe</b> <b>his</b> mind clean is taken from 'The Tempest' being [...] "What seest thou else in the dark backward and abysm of time?" [...] Fitting rather well into the story as Daniel Lamb spends the storyline struggling to remember his past which had been cleared by Dr. Pickman. If Pickman speaks this phrase in its entire length, Daniel Lamb's brain will be wiped, killing him, therefore failing the episode.|$|E
500|$|Gunn {{revealed}} that character introductions were the [...] "hardest scenes to crack", with Thanos' introduction {{being the most}} difficult. He felt that [...] "having Thanos be in that scene was more helpful to the [...] {{than it was to}} Guardians of the Galaxy," [...] yet he still wanted Thanos in the film, without [...] " [...] the actual antagonist of the film, which is Ronan." [...] To solve his dilemma, Gunn chose to have Ronan kill [...] "The Other", Thanos' vizier, saying, [...] "I thought that was interesting, because we’ve had the Other, who’s obviously very powerful even in comparison to Loki, and then we see Ronan <b>wipe</b> <b>his</b> ass with him. So that I liked, but even that was sort of difficult, because it played as funnier when I first wrote it, and the humor didn’t work so much." ...|$|E
500|$|Following this distraction, in January 942 Kourkouas {{launched}} a new campaign in the East, which lasted for three years. The first assault fell on the territory of Aleppo, which was thoroughly plundered: at {{the fall of the}} town of Hamus, near Aleppo, even Arab sources record the capture of 10–15,000 prisoners by the Byzantines. Despite a minor counter-raid by Thamal or one of his retainers (ghilman) from Tarsus in the summer, in autumn Kourkouas {{launched a}}nother major invasion. At the head of an exceptionally large army, some 80,000 men according to Arab sources, he crossed from allied Taron into northern Mesopotamia. Mayyafiriqin, Amida, Nisibis, Daraplaces where no Byzantine army had trod since the days of Heraclius 300years earlierwere stormed and ravaged. The real aim of these campaigns, however, was Edessa, the repository of the [...] "Holy Mandylion". This was a cloth believed to have been used by Christ to <b>wipe</b> <b>his</b> face, leaving an imprint of his features, and subsequently given to King Abgar V of Edessa. To the Byzantines, especially {{after the end of the}} Iconoclasm period and the restoration of image veneration, it was a relic of profound religious significance. As a result, its capture would provide the Lekapenos regime with an enormous boost in popularity and legitimacy.|$|E

500|$|Alan Stanley Blair of Airlock Alpha {{gave the}} episode a mixed review. He {{felt it was}} {{refreshing}} to have a story about aliens that weren't invading and opined that [...] "the brutal scenes at the abattoir and the whale-like moans of agony from the beast tug on a few heartstrings." [...] However, he criticised the realisation of the alien describing it as [...] "basically a giant, moaning turd {{sitting in the middle}} of a warehouse" [...] and [...] "a large lump of putty with eyes". He felt that the episode gave Rhys [...] "a chance to step into the spotlight for a change and prove he has what it takes to carry a story" [...] and felt his reaction to the existence of aliens to be [...] "perhaps the most realistic that the genre has produced". Despite this, he felt that Rhys finding out about Torchwood put an end to the [...] "fun" [...] of Gwen [...] "keeping secrets and concealing her double life" [...] and expressed disappointment that Jack didn't <b>wipe</b> <b>his</b> memory at the end of the episode. Travis Fickett of IGN rated the episode 7.6 on a one to ten scale and felt it provided a [...] "messy, odd and somewhat unsettling twist on alien encounters" [...] but felt the episode had several weak points. He felt it was hard not to see Rhys as [...] "a buffoon" [...] and questioned why Torchwood would use a civilian during a sting operation. He also felt that it pushed [...] "beyond the limits of its capacity to create convincing special effects" [...] and the creature itself looked like [...] "a hand puppet". Andrew Mickel of Den of Geek felt that Rhys has always been the [...] "Welsh heart of the show" [...] and praised his role in the episode for being [...] "actually rather entertaining, approaching everything with invigorating gusto." [...] However he also criticised the denouement of the episode for being [...] "daftly mawkish" [...] and opined that [...] "it’s always impossible to care about CGI characters".|$|E
2500|$|Brotherhood of Salutation (...) [...] This brotherhood {{starts from}} San Felipe Neri Church, Jesus of Nazareth of the Salutation {{represents}} {{the moment in}} which Jesus, in his way to Calvary, meets with the women and Veronica and she gave him her veil that he might <b>wipe</b> <b>his</b> forehead.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the comic}} strip story [...] "The World Shapers" [...] with the Sixth Doctor, {{published}} in Doctor Who Magazine #127–#129, an elderly Jamie remembers his time with the Doctor, explaining that the Doctor had taught him tricks to ensure the Time Lords would not really <b>wipe</b> <b>his</b> memories. In this story, written by Grant Morrison, Jamie sacrifices himself to stop the titular world shaper machine which was evolving aliens into Cybermen. Jamie's death outside the television series was controversial due to {{his status as a}} prominent companion,and the fact that story offers an origin story for the cybermen than contradicts almost everything else about them to have been produced.|$|E

2500|$|One of Ryang's classmates. He {{learned early}} that Fanta is a faerie. When Fanta tried to <b>wipe</b> <b>his</b> memory it was {{uncovered}} that Seho has a multiple-personality disorder {{consisting of two}} distinct personalities, which possibly resulted when his twin brother died at birth. [...] This condition prevents Fanta from wiping his memory or cutting his line of affinity. [...] His personalities consist of a [...] "geek" [...] Seho with glasses, closed eyes and a quieter disposition and a [...] "cool" [...] Seho with no glasses, open eyes and a wilder personality. In the eleventh book, the [...] "geek" [...] Seho called himself Jun when meeting with Sorim (his girlfriend).|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Me²" [...] (1988), Rimmer {{is shown}} {{moving in with}} his double as better company in the next bunkroom over from Lister. Rimmer's double reveals that all of Rimmer's brothers, but not Rimmer, were academy educated. Rimmer claims that this was because his father couldn't afford it. Rimmer also {{mentions}} taking a film course at night school, although he confuses a cartoon showing at the cinema in the episode with Citizen Kane. Lister watches a video of Rimmer's death, where his last words are [...] "gazpacho soup". Demonstrating intense, literal self-hatred, the second cruelly insults and berates the first. Believing that Lister is going to <b>wipe</b> <b>his</b> hologram anyway because of the two Rimmers' constant arguing, Rimmer explained his dying remark as referring to [...] a dinner at the captain's table with six officers, during he made a faux pas where he had his gazpacho soup taken away to be brought back hot, not realising that gazpacho soup {{is meant to be}} served cold. This caused the officers at the table to laugh at him, and he was never invited back. The incident haunted Rimmer {{for the rest of his}} life (and beyond). Gradually, his obsession over the incident caused him to remember it as the most disastrous, imbecilic action of his life, and it undermined his self-esteem out of all proportion. Lister, displaying deep empathy, tried to comfort Rimmer, assuring him that [...] "anybody could make a mistake like that." [...] His confession complete, Rimmer prepares to be wiped, but Lister wipes the second Rimmer instead; Lister had allowed Rimmer to believe his [...] "death" [...] was imminent because Lister wanted to know what the [...] "gazpacho soup" [...] remark meant, and he knew that Rimmer would never tell him any other circumstances.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{television}} {{adaptation of the}} play was in 1960 when the BBC produced a serial entitled An Age of Kings. The show comprised fifteen sixty- and seventy-five-minute episodes which adapted all eight of Shakespeare's sequential history plays. Directed by Michael Hayes and produced by Peter Dews, with a script by Eric Crozier, the production featured Terry Scully as Henry, Mary Morris as Margaret, Julian Glover as Edward and Paul Daneman as Richard. The twelfth episode, [...] covers Acts 1, 2 and Act 3, Scenes 1 and 2, concluding with Richard's soliloquy wherein he vows to attain the crown. The thirteenth episode, , presents everything from Act 3, Scene 3 onwards, beginning with Margaret's visit to Louis XI in France. With each episode running one hour, {{a great deal of}} text was necessarily removed, but aside from truncation, only minor alterations were made to the original. For example, in [...] "The Morning's War", the character of Edmund, Earl of Rutland is played by an adult actor, whereas in the text, he is a child and Margaret is present during the murder of Rutland, and we see her <b>wipe</b> <b>his</b> blood on the handkerschief which she later gives to York. Additionally, Richard fights and kills Clifford during the Battle of [...] Towton. In the text, they fight, but Clifford flees and is mortally wounded off-stage when hit by an arrow. In [...] "The Sun in Splendour", Edward is rescued from his imprisonment by Richard and Lord Stafford, whereas in the play, he is rescued by Richard, Lord Hastings and William Stanley. Also, the end of the episode differs slightly {{from the end of the}} play. After Edward [...] expresses his wish that all conflict has ceased, a large celebration ensues. As the credits role, Richard and George stand to one side, and George almost slips into a barrel of wine, only to be saved by Richard. As George walks away, Richard thinks to himself and then smiles deviously at the camera.|$|E
