5|$|Despite {{his agent}} Milan Ćalasan's insistence {{that his client}} would not be playing in the lower divisions, Žigić {{underwent}} groin surgery in the close season and resumed his Birmingham career in September. He told the Mail {{that he would be}} happy to stay and that any move <b>would</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> club, which was in increasing financial difficulty, wanting to sell. His first Championship goal gave Birmingham a 1–0 win against Leeds United. Early in the Europa League group match at Braga, Birmingham were awarded a penalty. In the absence of regular penalty-taker Marlon King, Žigić took on the responsibility. His attempt was saved, Braga won the match 1–0, and Birmingham finished the group one point behind them and Club Brugge so failed to qualify for the knockout rounds. Away to Leeds, Žigić scored all four in a 4–1 win, and he finished the season with eleven in the league and one in the play-off semi-final as Birmingham lost on aggregate to Blackpool.|$|E

25|$|Ultimately, Gambia {{opted to}} block Saidy's {{participation}} for Norway in major international championships for three years. This measure was created mainly to stop African athletes from pursuing careers in more wealthy nations, such as Olympic champion runner Saif Saaeed Shaheen who changed his allegiance from Kenya to Qatar. However, unlike Shaheen, Saidy was a naturalized Norwegian. Still, since leaving his Gambian citizenship behind, Saidy {{was not able}} to represent any nation at the 2007 World Championships, even while his name was accompanied by the Norwegian flag in the IAAF World Athletics Tour meetings. The Norwegian Athletics Association then hoped to get the block lifted in time for the 2008 Summer Olympics; this <b>would</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> approval of the Gambia Athletics Association.|$|E

He also said that Clancy had been hit with up to five bullets, which made eight wounds; Dick McKee had three wounds caused by two bullets. He said McKee had no bayonet wounds, {{but there was a}} bullet lodged underneath his skin on the right of his chest. Clune, he said, had nine wounds caused by seven bullets. T.

25|$|If {{ecosystems}} are governed primarily by stochastic processes, through which its subsequent {{state would be}} determined by both predictable and random actions, {{they may be more}} resilient to sudden change than each species individually. In the absence of a balance of nature, the species composition of ecosystems would undergo shifts that <b>would</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nature of the change, but entire ecological collapse would probably be infrequent events. In 1997, Robert Ulanowicz used information theory tools to describe the structure of ecosystems, emphasizing mutual information (correlations) in studied systems. Drawing on this methodology and prior observations of complex ecosystems, Ulanowicz depicts approaches to determining the stress levels on ecosystems and predicting system reactions to defined types of alteration in their settings (such as increased or reduced energy flow, and eutrophication.|$|E
25|$|Earlier in the year, Alpha Oumar Konaré, the {{chairman}} of the commission of the African Union and former president of Mali, reportedly urged Bozizé not to stand for election. Bozizé gave an interview to Radio France Internationale on May 17 in which he refused to say whether or not he would run, but he confirmed that Konaré had spoken to him about it, while criticizing Konaré for what he called interference in the country's affairs, and wondering whether he had consulted the opinions of the Central African people before getting involved. He stressed that the matter <b>would</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> will of the people. Some of his supporters campaigned prominently for him to stand. About 5,000 people walked in Bangui on June 19 to support his candidacy; Bozizé thanked them and asked for time to reflect.|$|E
25|$|The {{first nations}} guides turned for home {{as had been}} agreed, as did Wentzel, leaving Franklin with fifteen voyageurs and his four Britons. Franklin gave orders to those departing that caches of food were to be left on route and that most {{importantly}} Fort Enterprise be stocked with {{a large amount of}} dried meat. With the lateness of the season the latter point was crucial because Franklin now feared that if, as seemed likely, he failed to reach Repulse Bay, the sea would freeze and prevent him returning to the mouth of the Coppermine River. If so, he would be forced to make a direct return across the Barren Lands, where he and his men would be dependent on whatever food they could forage. There was therefore a real risk that they would be close to starvation {{by the time they reached}} Fort Enterprise; he frequently repeated that their survival <b>would</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> huts being well stocked.|$|E

25|$|The Tokyo Conference on Afghanistan, held on 8 July 2012 was the civilian-diplomatic bookend to NATO’s 2012 May {{summit in}} Chicago, where the {{alliance}} confirmed plans to withdraw foreign combat troops {{by the end}} of 2014 and pledged about $4 billion a year to pay for ongoing training, equipment and financial support for Afghanistan’s security forces. In exchange for pledges from the Afghan government to combat corruption $16 billion {{over the next four years}} for civilian projects such as roads to schools or projects aimed to strengthen the rule of law were pledged by the some 70 nations attending the conference. The reconstruction and development aid was pledged for the timeframe through 2015, but under the condition that the Afghan government reduce corruption before receiving all of the money. In the so-called Tokyo Framework of Mutual Accountability foreign governments will assure Afghanistan a steady stream of financing in exchange for stronger anticorruption measures and the establishment of the rule of law. Up to 20 percent of the money <b>would</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> government meeting governance standards according to the Tokyo Framework of Mutual Accountability.|$|E
25|$|More than 6000 {{occupational}} schemes were {{in place}} in the UK in 2015, of which over 5000 were in deficit. The total shortfall of the schemes was over 360 billion pounds as of February 2015. A large number of UK employers offer their employees access to a defined benefit occupational pension scheme, often based on final salary. In such an arrangement, the employee was typically promised a pension of a fixed proportion of their salary in the period leading up to retirement. The proportion <b>would</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> number of years of service with the employer. Post retirement increases are typically partly discretionary. The amounts payable are restricted by taxation rules, the maximum being typically either a pension of one-sixtieth of final salary for each year of membership or a pension of one-eightieth of their salary per year of membership plus a tax free lump sum of three-eightieths. With increases in longevity and reductions in interest rates, such arrangements were becoming progressively unaffordable. So following a review by a Pensions Commission, to get a given income, the length it is necessary to pay into a pension in the public sector is linked to longevity.|$|E
25|$|Haig {{thought that}} IV Corps had bungled {{and that a}} {{counter-attack}} big enough to ensure success would need another 40 British heavy artillery batteries. The offensive on the Somme was imminent and although Haig thought that the guns could {{be returned to the}} Somme in time, this <b>would</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> German reaction. Should the Germans continue operations on the ridge, the existing British positions would be at risk and there might be a delay in returning the guns. Although the Germans had gained observation over the British lines, they had not become untenable and Haig decided that the diversionary Attack on the Gommecourt Salient north of the Somme, was more important. On 17 May, Haig ordered the First Army to cancel its attack; IV Corps was to plan instead for a much bigger effort. The plans produced by IV Corps were the basis of the scheme for the Canadian Corps attack at the Battle of Vimy Ridge (9–12 April 1917). Rupprecht was pleased about the large bag of prisoners (229) who were questioned by German interrogators, who gleaned much information on the orders of battle of the 47th (1/2nd London) and the 25th divisions, the way that British artillery-observation officers worked, details about machine-guns and field fortification.|$|E

25|$|S. 517 {{would impose}} a private-sector mandate by {{eliminating}} an existing right {{of action for}} wireless carriers (and others), who are currently able to pursue legal action against those who, without permission, circumvent the access controls on certain wireless telephone handsets. The cost of the mandate would be the forgone net value of settlements and damages in such cases. A search of the literature suggests that few, if any, of those types of lawsuits have been brought against individual consumers. Because such claims would probably be uncommon {{in the future and}} the damage awards allowed in such cases would be relatively small, CBO estimates that the cost of this mandate would be small and fall below the annual threshold established in UMRA for private-sector mandate ($152 million in 2014, adjusted annually for inflation). If the Librarian of Congress decides to broaden the exemption allowed under the bill to cover other types of mobile devices, such an action would eliminate additional rights of action. The cost of that expansion would depend on what devices the Librarian would include under the exemption and the forgone net value of settlements and damages. CBO has no basis to estimate the cost of such mandates as it <b>would</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> regulatory actions taken by the Librarian.|$|E
25|$|The device he designed, later {{known as}} a Michelson interferometer, sent yellow light from a sodium flame (for alignment), or white light (for the actual observations), through a half-silvered mirror {{that was used to}} split it into two beams {{traveling}} at right angles to one another. After leaving the splitter, the beams traveled out to the ends of long arms where they were reflected back into the middle by small mirrors. They then recombined {{on the far side of}} the splitter in an eyepiece, producing a pattern of constructive and destructive interference whose transverse displacement <b>would</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> relative time it takes light to transit the longitudinal vs. the transverse arms. If the Earth is traveling through an aether medium, a beam reflecting back and forth parallel to the flow of aether would take longer than a beam reflecting perpendicular to the aether because the time gained from traveling downwind is less than that lost traveling upwind. Michelson expected that the Earth's motion would produce a fringe shift equal to 0.04 fringes—that is, of the separation between areas of the same intensity. He did not observe the expected shift; the greatest average deviation that he measured (in the northwest direction) was only 0.018 fringes; most of his measurements were much less. His conclusion was that Fresnel's hypothesis of a stationary aether with partial aether dragging would have to be rejected, and thus he confirmed Stokes' hypothesis of complete aether dragging.|$|E
25|$|D.C. United's sudden turn in {{fortunes}} {{continued in}} the team's final home regular-season match, against cellar-dwelling Chicago Fire. United broke through {{late in the first}} half, when Pontius won a race, beating two defenders and the Fire's goalie, Jon Busch to the ball and then rounding the goalie and slotting home the first goal. Midway through the second half, Boswell scored with a header on a corner kick taken by Espindola. A few minutes later, Espindola got his own goal, with an assist to DeLeon, when a sharply taken shot was deflected just inside the near post. A 4-0 scoreline was completed when a deflected shot came to Saborio in the 6-yard box, and the Costa Rican striker's shot beat the Fire 'keeper. The four-goal margin was the team's largest margin of victory since August 2011. The team would close out the regular season in Columbus, part of MLS' first Decision Day. Going into this final day, United held a one-point lead over Columbus for second place in the Eastern Conference, but four teams would be playing with a chance at claiming second place and a bye through the first round of MLS playoffs. That prize <b>would</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> results in Columbus and in a match being played at the same time between visiting Montreal and host Toronto. As United geared to play the MLS regular season finale, CONCACAF group play concluded. Thanks to a goal surrendered by the Los Angeles Galaxy on the last kick of their game in Guatemala, D.C. United would carry the #2 seed into the CONCACAF quarterfinals, matching them against the #7 seed, Queretaro F.C. in early 2016.|$|E
