The facial disc plays a part in this process, as is shown {{by the fact that}} with the ruff feathers removed, the bird can still locate the source in azimuth but fails to do so in elevation. Hunting nocturnally or crepuscularly, this bird can target its prey and dive to the ground, penetrating its talons through snow, grass or brush to seize small creatures with deadly accuracy. Compared to other owls of similar size, the barn owl has a much higher metabolic rate, requiring relatively more food. <b>Weight</b> <b>for</b> <b>weight,</b> barn owls consume more rodents—often regarded as pests by humans—than possibly any other creature. This makes the barn owl one of the most economically valuable wildlife animals for agriculture. Farmers often find these owls more effective than poison in keeping down rodent pests, and they can encourage barn owl habitation by providing nest sites.|$|E

[...] In Gabon, before the arrival of Europeans, the coast people carried on a remunerative trade with those of the interior by the medium of sea salt. [...] This was gradually displaced by the salt that Europeans brought in sacks, so that the coast natives lost their previous profits; as of the author's writing in 1958, sea salt was still the currency best appreciated in the interior.|$|E

60|$|Even a prejudiced {{observer}} will readily {{admit that}} the most valuable mineral on earth is mud. Diamonds and rubies are just nowhere by comparison. I don't mean <b>weight</b> <b>for</b> <b>weight,</b> of course--mud is 'cheap as dirt,' to buy in small quantities--but aggregate for aggregate. Quite literally, and without hocus-pocus of any sort, the money valuation of the mud in the world must outnumber many thousand times the money valuation {{of all the other}} minerals put together. Only we reckon it usually not by the ton, but by the acre, though the acre is worth most where the mud lies deepest. Nay, more, the world's wealth is wholly based on mud. Corn, not gold, is the true standard of value. Without mud there would be no human life, no productions of any kind: for food stuffs of every description are raised on mud; and where no mud exists, or can be made to exist, there, we say, there is desert or sand-waste. Land, without mud, has no economic value. To put it briefly, the only parts of the world that count much for human habitation are the mud deposits of the great rivers, and notably of the Nile, the Euphrates, the Ganges, the Indus, the Irrawaddy, the Hoang Ho, the Yang-tse-Kiang; of the Po, the Rhone, the Danube, the Rhine, the Volga, the Dnieper; of the St. Lawrence, the Mississippi, the Missouri, the Orinoco, the Amazons, the La Plata. A corn-field is just a big mass of mud; and the deeper and purer and freer from stones or other impurities it is the better.|$|E

40|$|Abstract-Text {{categorization}} is {{the task}} of automatically assigning unlabeled text documents to some predefined category labels {{by means of an}} induction algorithm. Since the data in text categorization are high-dimensional, feature selection is broadly used in text categorization systems for reducing the dimensionality. In the literature, there are some widely known metrics such as information gain and document frequency thresholding. Recently, a generative graphical model called latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) {{that can be used to}} model and discover the underlying topic structures of textual data, was proposed. In this paper, we use the hidden topic analysis of LDA for feature selection and compare it with the classical feature selection metrics in text categorization. For the experiments, we use SVM as the classifier and tf*idf <b>weighting</b> <b>for</b> <b>weighting</b> the terms.

50|$|In February 1943, the {{prospects}} of the project were transformed. Pyke had learned from a report by Herman Mark and his assistant Walter Holenstein that ice made from water mixed with wood fibres formed a strong solid mass - very much stronger than pure water ice. Mark had been in Vienna, but had by 1940 escaped from Nazi Europe to USA. Scientists working for Pyke at the Brooklyn Polytechnic's Cold Research Laboratory experimented with mixtures of between 4 and 14% wood pulp and their initial tests gave fantastic results. The composition was at first known as piccolite and was later called pykrete. Pyke handed Herman Mark's report to Max Perutz (who had been a student of Physical chemistry under Mark in Vienna), who developed the pykrete idea in a requisitioned meat store at Smithfield Market.
