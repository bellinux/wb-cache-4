500|$|After {{the episode}} aired, in the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] {{featurette}} released by HBO for [...] "The Door", David Benioff and D. B. Weiss {{revealed that the}} closing scene involving Hodor's name origin and subsequent death was an idea that was presented to them directly from George R. R. Martin. Benioff stated, [...] "We had this meeting with George Martin where we're trying {{to get as much}} information as possible out of him, and probably the most shocking revelation he had for us was when he told us the origin of Hodor and how that name came about. I just remember Dan and I looking at each other when he said that and just being like, 'Holy shit.'" [...] Weiss continued, [...] "It {{was just one of the}} saddest and most affecting things. Even sitting in a hotel room having someone tell you this was going to happen in the abstract in some way and that 'hold the door' was the origin of the name Hodor, <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> that was a really, really heart-breaking idea." ...|$|E
500|$|Another {{idea from}} which the episode was crafted was the fictional [...] "tween wave" [...] genre: initially, the episode would have found the genre enjoyed by all {{citizens}} {{of the town of}} South Park, not just a younger audience. By Sunday, completed animated shots were being edited together and set to the song [...] "Landslide" [...] by Fleetwood Mac. The song's use in the episode was unsure until Tuesday night, when they eventually received clearance to use it. Parker noted later that they had backup songs to use if necessary, but none fit as well as [...] "Landslide". They were very satisfied with the ending, feeling it provided a very emotional conclusion to the show. In addition, the episodes contains what Parker describes in the commentary as [...] "our favorite thing of any South Park ever": the Duck President, who communicates by spraying feces from his mouth. [...] "Every time in the retake room when Duck President was on, shitting, quacking and shitting, <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> it was the greatest thing ever," [...] he remarked.|$|E
500|$|In the {{following}} episode of The Chaser's War on Everything, the team emphasised that their only realistic attempt {{to disguise the}} vehicles {{was the use of}} a Canadian flag. Taylor later said that there was [...] "no particular reason we chose Canada, <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> they'd be a country who the cops wouldn't scrutinise too closely, and who feasibly would only have three cars in their motorcade—as opposed to the 20 or so gas guzzlers that Bush has brought with him". There were many deliberate indications that the motorcade was not genuine, particularly on the fake credentials used by the team; members' security passes were printed with JOKE, Insecurity, and It's pretty obvious this isn't a real pass all clearly visible, while the APEC 2007 Official Vehicle stickers included both the name of the series and the text This dude likes trees and poetry and certain types of carnivorous plants excite him. In addition, some of the runners were holding camcorders and one of the motorcyclists was wearing jeans, both highly unusual for an official motorcade.|$|E

6000|$|She {{had fallen}} in quite early with this freak of {{speaking}} and thinking as if he and she were all mankind. It was as if her mind had been prepared for it by her own eager exploration in Europe. [...] "My friend, the philosopher," [...] he had said, [...] "will not have it that we are really the individuals we think we are. You must talk to him--he is a very curious and subtle thinker. <b>We</b> are <b>just</b> <b>thoughts</b> in the Mind of the Race, he says, passing thoughts. We are--what does he call it?--Man on his Planet, taking control of life." ...|$|R
500|$|The Feminist Improvising Group (FIG) {{was founded}} in London in 1977 by Scottish vocalist Maggie Nicols from Centipede and English bassoonist/composer Lindsay Cooper from Henry Cow. Nicols and Cooper first {{discussed}} {{the idea of an}} all-women improvising group at a musician's union meeting. Cooper said, [...] "we agreed that improvisation had become very important and no women were doing it. And suddenly we thought, well let's do it! Let's get women together and do it ourselves!" [...] While Nicols and Cooper had both performed frequently with men, they had little experience performing with other women, but their involvement in class politics as well as feminist and lesbian activism prompted them to pursue this project. The other members of the five-piece ensemble were cellist/bassist Georgie Born, also from Henry Cow, vocalist/pianist Cathy Williams from the British duo Rag Doll, and trumpeter Corinne Liensol from British feminist rock band Jam Today. They had originally intended to call themselves the [...] "Women's Improvising Group", but at their first engagement they discovered that the organisers had billed them as the [...] "Feminist Improvising Group". Nicols said that the [...] "political statement of the band's name never even came from us! But <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought,</b> 'OK, they've called us feminist, we'll work with that.|$|E
2500|$|Later {{when asked}} why he had perpetrated the killings, White claimed that they were carried out to strike fear into the Catholic {{community}} after the IRA's 1973 Coleraine bombings. Regarding Irene Andrews, White replied, [...] "We didn't know she was a Protestant, <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> she was a Catholic to be honest".|$|E
2500|$|Sykes {{has stated}} that the band was better focused when in the studio, which {{made it easier for}} them to {{experiment}} with song writing and to expand their sound: [...] "We didn't really have any other band we wanted to sound like or any other style. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> we'd try to do something different and see what comes out. And this is what came out." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{workshop}} announcement started simply enough: “Your {{students are}} usingit. You are using it. Why {{not get the}} most out of Google tools?” The workshop, called “Using Google Like a Librarian,” was for faculty and staff at Grand Valley State University. Over the past two years, librarians have been teaming up with instructional technology staff to create on-campus professional development opportunities, and this was going to be (<b>we</b> <b>thought)</b> <b>just</b> another workshop. And then it got popular...|$|R
5000|$|David Downes {{also gave}} an {{interview}} about the album, saying “We’ve recorded ‘The Water Is Wide' with the fabulous bagad Lann-Bihoué, and it’s an interesting collaboration because when I was 19 I toured with Alan Stivell, famous breton musician, and I worked with Dan Ar Braz, also kind of famous breton musician, {{and a lot}} of Celtic Woman musicians and our engineer, Andrew Boland, have worked in the past with the bagad Lann-Bihoué and with many musicians over there. So it seemed like a very natural collaboration. We’re kind of brothers-in-arms, I suppose, so <b>we</b> all really <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> this would be a great idea. The bagad is so fantastic, and the opportunity is great for us to get to work with them.” ...|$|R
60|$|When we had {{finished}} these vain adornments and Bastin had {{put away the}} things and tidied up, we sat down, rather at a loose end. We should have liked to walk but refrained from doing so for fear lest we might dirty our clean clothes. So <b>we</b> <b>just</b> sat and <b>thought.</b> At least Bickley thought, and so did I for a while until I gave it up. What {{was the use of}} thinking, seeing that we were face to face with circumstances which baffled reason and beggared all recorded human experience? What Bastin did I am sure I do not know, but I think from the expression of his countenance that he was engaged in composing sermons for the benefit of Oro and the Glittering Lady.|$|R
2500|$|Weil {{recalled}} that, [...] "after Phil, Barry and I finished , {{we took it}} over to the Righteous Brothers. Bill Medley, who has the low voice, {{seemed to}} like the song." [...] However, Medley initially felt that the song didn't suit their more up-tempo rhythm and blues style, and Mann and Spector had sung the song in a higher key: [...] "And <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought,</b> [...] "Wow, what a good song for The Everly Brothers." [...] But it didn't seem right for us." [...] The song, which has a very big range, was originally written at a higher key of F. To accommodate Medley's baritone voice, this was gradually lowered, eventually down to C, which, together with slowing the song down, changed the [...] "whole vibe of the song" [...] according to Medley.|$|E
2500|$|With their {{previous}} contract with Warner Bros. Records having expired in 2011, the band re-signed to Warner Bros. for the United States and to Bella Union in Europe in early 2012. The first release under these new deals was The Flaming Lips and Heady Fwends, initially released as a limited edition vinyl-only package for Record Store Day on April 21. The album features collaborations with {{artists such as}} Kesha, Nick Cave, and Erykah Badu. In an interview with American Songwriter, Coyne stated that [...] "Since we were releasing music every month, {{we thought it would}} be a little bit boring for us each month to say 'Well here's four more Flaming Lips songs.' <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> 'Well we'll get some of our friends, and we'll do collaborations and see what happens.'" [...] The album later received a wider release on CD and digitally on June 26 in the US and July 30 in Europe.|$|E
2500|$|To reunite {{the couple}} in {{dramatic}} fashion, the show had Myrtle urge Bianca to follow Lena {{to the airport and}} demand an explanation; on the April 23, 2003 episode, the two characters shared the first same-sex kiss in American soap opera history. [...] "It's that kind of old romantic airport scene in which the two lovers decide whether they can take the risk and take a chance on love -- only it's two women this time," [...] relayed Riegel. Riegel had never kissed a woman before. [...] "I was a little nervous because I wanted it to look natural and organic and real and true," [...] she said. [...] "I didn't want it to seem tentative." [...] Riegel and Olga Sosnovska discussed practicing the kiss. [...] "We thought about maybe trying it out in the dressing room first," [...] Riegel laughed. [...] "But then <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought,</b> 'We are professionals. This will be fine." [...] The writers detailed [...] "fun and daring" [...] moves in the episode, such as having Bianca discuss with Myrtle her confusion about Lena leaving her. Myrtle, in her aristocratic British accent, replied, [...] "Maybe it was too hot!" [...] Giving insight into Bianca's unlucky romantic life, she suggested that Bianca loves unavailable women because her mother is always running away from true love.|$|E
5000|$|Bill Leeb called {{predecessor}} album AirMech a [...] "really cool warm-up" [...] for {{the production}} of Echogenetic and added: [...] "We <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> should <b>just</b> continue on and evolve and keep that going for the new Front Line record." ...|$|R
5000|$|The album title, For All We Know {{was named}} {{so after the}} 1934 jazz song of the same name, as a {{reference}} to the artist's background in the genre. She also opened up about the album title in a YouTube trilogy she created to tell her fans about the background of creating the album. She said, [...] "So, for me, that kind of just sums up everything for me. It's just such a lovely message So love me, love me tonight/tomorrow was made for some/tomorrow may never come/for all <b>we</b> know. I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> that was so beautiful because it just says that tomorrow is not guaranteed so anything that we want to do, we have to make it happen today and I think that just kind of sums up this journey for me". In an interview with Billboard, Nao advanced that the album was [...] "a definite nod" [...] to 1990s music and an attempt at transposing it to actuality.|$|R
2500|$|Originally {{just short}} 60 second videos edited in iMovie and {{uploaded}} to Vimeo, the first episodes of Jake and Amir were just something Jake and Amir did to make each-other laugh. Eventually, however, the videos gained such popularity that CollegeHumor started paying {{them to create}} them full-time. Jake explains that Jake and Amir was never {{intended to be a}} series, [...] "We actually had no idea we were creating a series at the time we were doing it. I <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> Amir was so funny, and I had this crappy camera. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> made these videos and our friends started passing them around. It kind of grew from there." ...|$|R
2500|$|In December 2003, EastEnders made {{headlines}} in the UK press after they screened a kiss between Kelly and Zoe. The storyline was featured in a New Year's Eve episode that was filmed on-location in Scotland. In the storyline, a group of teenagers travel from London to Scotland for New Year's Eve, but their minibus crashes, leaving them stranded and injured on the freezing cold Scottish moors. While stranded, Kelly cares for an injured Zoe, they become over-emotional, and kiss. Kinsella explained the reasons behind the kiss: [...] "They're stuck in the hills, thinking they're going to die—it's {{a way of saying}} goodbye and also of showing how much they love each other as friends. Which is quite sweet really." [...] She claimed that the kiss was made easier {{due to the fact that}} she was kissing her off-screen best friend: [...] "That made it so much easier. We thought we were just going to be laughing and giggling the whole way through, but we were very professional. It was so cold that we just wanted to get it over with. We were shaking from cold—not from nerves—and it was raining, so <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought,</b> 'Let's do it and get it done with'. [...] We laugh about it now. When it came down to it, the truth was that it was just like any other screen kiss." [...] The episode featuring their kiss attracted [...] 9.5million viewers, and the precise moment that they kissed was watched by 44% of the available viewing audience.|$|E

500|$|According to Rob Kay, the game's Lead Designer, {{the idea}} of Guitar Hero was {{directly}} inspired by Konami's Guitar Freaks arcade game, where the player used a guitar-shaped controller {{to interact with the}} game. At the time, GuitarFreaks had not seen much exposure in North America. [...] RedOctane was making dance pads for games like Dance Dance Revolution for home consoles and also operated an online video rental service similar to Netflix. [...] RedOctane's Kai and Charles Huang recognized the popularity of GuitarFreaks in Japan through their rental service, and planned to create guitar controllers to bring the game to North America. [...] The Huangs raised $1.75million for the effort, despite being turned down by some investors who [...] "thought [...] was too weird". Greg Fischbach, {{one of the founders of}} Acclaim Entertainment, noted, regretfully several years later, they had passed on Guitar Hero, questioning [...] "Who's going to buy a peripheral like that?" [...] The Huangs approached Harmonix, who had previously made music video games such as Frequency, Amplitude and Karaoke Revolution about making a guitar-based video game for those controllers. With a budget of about one million dollars (which Kay noted was [...] "pretty tiny for a video game"), the two companies worked together to develop Guitar Hero. Kay noted that [...] "No one had any notions about it being a massive success; <b>we</b> all <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> it would be fun to do." [...] Harmonix's president Alex Rigopulos also claims that former Microsoft vice-president of game publishing Ed Fries indirectly influenced the game's creation, who had previously told Harmonix when they were pitching Frequency to Microsoft that no music-rhythm game would succeed without custom hardware for it, prompting Rigopulos to investigate the Guitar Hero opportunity when it arose.|$|R
