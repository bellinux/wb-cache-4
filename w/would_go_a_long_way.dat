5|$|While the Ordainers {{were at work}} {{drafting}} their reform document, Edward {{decided to}} address {{one of the main}} causes behind the discontent: the Scottish situation. Edward II had, almost immediately after his accession, abandoned the relentless Scottish campaigns of his father. As a result, Robert the Bruce had been able to regain the initiative in the war, reconquer lost territory, and stage destructive raids into the north of England. To aggravate matters, Edward had continued to raise extortionate taxes, ostensibly for the war in Scotland, but without showing any result. If the King could produce victory against the Scots, this <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> towards undermining the work of the Ordainers. In June, the King summoned the magnates for a military campaign, but most of the Ordainers refused {{on the basis of the}} work they were performing. When the King departed for Scotland in September, only Gloucester, Warenne and Gaveston among the earls accompanied him. The campaign proved frustrating for Edward, when Bruce refused to engage in open battle, or even get involved in negotiations. In February, Gaveston was sent with an army north from Roxburgh to Perth, but he failed to track down the Scottish army.|$|E

"Aura", this set's opener, {{manages to}} be a {{multitude}} of songs at once, jumping from nosebleed bass to (Middle) Eastern-coloured tones, a Spaghetti Western monologue to a stars-bound middle-eight, from quite-deliberately provocative talk of slavery {{and the meaning of}} the burqa to mindless cosmic love waffle.

60|$|Mr. Townsend was, as I have said, {{the very}} {{opposite}} to Mr. Carter, {{but he also}} was a man who could do without the comforts of life, if the comforts of life did not come readily in his way. He liked his glass of whisky punch dearly, and had an idea that it was good for him. Not caring much about personal debts, he <b>would</b> <b>go</b> in debt for whisky. But if the whisky and credit were at an end, the loss did not make him miserable. He was a man with a large appetite, and who took great advantage of a good dinner when it was before him; nay, he <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> distance to insure a good dinner; but, nevertheless, he would leave himself without the means of getting a mutton chop, and then not be unhappy. Now Mr. Carter would have been very unhappy had he been left without his superfine long black coat.|$|R

40|$|Measuring the {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} cosmic rays in the energy region of {{greater than or equal}} to 10 (exp 12) eV would be highly useful in settling several nagging questions concerning the propagation of cosmic rays in the galaxy. In particular an accurate measurement of secondary to primary ratios such as Boron to Carbon would gibe clear evidence as to whether the propagation of cosmic rays is determined by a diffusion coefficient that varies with the particle's energy as E(sup 0. 5) or E(sup 0. 3). This <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> ways in helping us to understand the anistropy (or lack thereof) of the highest energy cosmic rays and the power requirements for producing those particles at approximately equal to 10 (exp 18) eV which are believed to be highest energy particles produced in the Galaxy. This would be only one of the benefits of a mission such as ACCESS to perform direct particle measurements on very high energy cosmic rays...|$|R

Blacky <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> {{distance}} to do that. He hates terrible guns and the men who use them. And he knows all about them. He has very sharp eyes, has Blacky, and he knows when a man has got a gun and when he hasn't. More than that, he can tell better than any one I know of just how near he can safely go to one of those terrible guns. He is smart, my cousin Blacky is, and if he will help me look for Mr. Quack, we'll find him if he is alive." ...|$|R
5000|$|The loss of Albert Johnston was a {{particularly}} severe blow to the Confederacy. President Jefferson Davis called it [...] "the turning point of our fate."

6000|$|We {{understand}} that our brethren, the Methodists, have recently {{decided to leave}} the word [...] "obey" [...] out of the marriage-service.
