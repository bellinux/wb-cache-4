40|$|Sedimentary {{structures}} of some coastal tropical tidal flats {{of the east}} coast of India, and inner estuarine tidal point bars located at 30 to 50 kilometers inland from the coast, have been extensively studied under varying seasonal conditions. The results reveal that physical features such as flaser bedding, herringbone cross-bedding, lenticular bedding, and mud/silt couplets are common to both the environments. In fact, flaser bedding and lenticular bedding are more common in the point bar facies during the monsoon months than in the coastal tidal flat environments. Interference ripples, though common in both the environments, show different architectural patterns for different environmental domains. Interference ripples with thread-like secondary set overriding the earlier ripple-form, resembling <b>wrinkle</b> <b>marks,</b> are the typical features in estuarine point bars near the high water region. Because structures which are so far considered as key structures for near-coastal tidal flats are common to both the environments, caution should be exercised for deciphering palaeo-environments, particularly for Proterozoic rocks, where one has to depend only on physical sedimentary structures...|$|R

40|$|The MRS/MISS of the Makgabeng Formation {{encompasses}} sand cracks, <b>wrinkle</b> <b>marks,</b> mat fragments, mat {{chips and}} roll-ups {{and those of}} the Magaliesberg formation are <b>wrinkle</b> <b>marks,</b> petees/petee ridges, sand cracks, and multi-directional ripples. The sedimentary process that moderated the formational mechanism of the MISS of the Makgabeng Formation is (descriptively allochthonous) of high energy (inter-dune depositional setting) that eroded, transported and re-deposited mat bound sediments. The genetic mechanism of the MISS of the Magaliesberg Formation is descriptively authochthonous because of enhanced resistance of biostabilized sediments to being reworked. XRF (major and trace) and XRD analysis (qualitative and quantitative) was done on MISS bearing sedimentary rock layers (A) and underlying sedimentary sections (B) of Magaliesberg and Makgabeng samples. Result show high quartz content of all the analyzed samples compared to average sandstones. This premise suggests a relation of microbes (e. g. cyanobacteria) to phototrophy and/photoautotrophy because of the conduction properties of translucent quartz. Also plausible inference is that the intense chemical weathering that produced the quartz arenite was positively influenced by microbes, as noted in some Proterozoic basins. There is higher concentration of Ba in all A samples compared to B (Makgabeng and Magaliesberg) which might be emblematic of biogenicity. The Magaliesberg analyzed samples (MAG 101, 102, 103) exhibit homogeneity by the higher concentration of Al 2 O 3, TiO 2, K 2 O, and P 2 O 5, and lower concentration of SiO 2 in the A compared to the B subsamples of a particular sample. Also, Magaliesberg analyzed samples (MAG 101, 102, 103) exhibit homogeneity by the lower concentration of quartz and higher concentration of muscovite in the A compared to the B subsamples. This exact established negative correlation between the duo of SiO 2 and quartz, and the quartet of Al 2 O 3, TiO 2, K 2 O, and P 2 O 5, and muscovite as in Magaliesberg samples pertains also to a Makgabeng sample (MKG 102; roll-up). MKG 101 (mat fragment) deviates from this mineralogical and geochemical trend. Each of the A samples of MAG 101, 102, 103, are uniformly of higher concentration in Ce, Cr, Nb, Th, V, Y, Zn, Zr compared to the B version of that sample. MKG 101 and 102 are uniformly of lower concentration of Ce, Cr, Nb, Th, V, Y, Zn, Zr in A compared to the B version of that sample. The A of each of the samples MAG 101, 102, and 103 has higher concentration of Hf and Rb compared to its B; a character that is also exhibit in MKG 102, and MKG 101 is vice versa. Microscopy shows that A of all the samples is of smaller grain size compared to B, espousing affinity of microbes to fine-medium grained sandstones. Microscopy of the Magaliesberg Formation samples show Pseudo petee ridges and pseudo cross lamination which reflect biostabilization, and microscopy of the Makgabeng Formation show roll-ups, mat chips and composite mat chips. The MISS genetic difference of the two formations is related to energy, water residence time (emergence and inundation), Ph, and similarity is related to mutuality in shallow water environment. Mat types are inferred to be biologically, physically and chemically moderated adaptations of microbial communities to specific cum peculiar locally prevailing environmental conditions; factors that are premised on taphonomy and ecology.

In this year, he entered the École des Beaux-Arts. At first he had to engrave fashion-plates to make money enough to live, but his application to his art brought him the Prix de Rome for engraving, in 1856. At his first public showing in 1860, his prints were called laboured, soft, and flaccid, more like Drypoint etchings than burin work, and he was advised {{to adhere to the}} established rules of his art. Gaillard had already chosen a new method, and his work was a shock, because not done according to the formulae of that day.

Gaillard's new manner was to engrave with soft, delicate lines, drawn closely together but not crossing, and to render every fold, <b>wrinkle,</b> or <b>mark</b> on the skin with care. Henceforth Gaillard was represented by engravings and paintings at every Salon. He was best known for his L'Homme à l'Oeillet, completed in eight days, which brought him only $100.|$|R

A interiorização dos sofrimentos, podem aumentar o processo de alterações ocasionadas na pele facial, como; flacidez, rugas, marcas e manchas senis. Estes são apenas tratados externamente pelo modelo biomédico, esquecendo de investigar o interior do ser humano, as suas emoções, sua alma, a sua energia vital que podem contribuir para o processo do envelhecimento quando desequilibradas. A sociedade atual valoriza muito os jovens, deixando os idosos isolados e com baixo-estima,, sendo desprezados, não tendo o direito de se cuidarem principalmente em relação a beleza, por se acharem que já estão velhos e feios. Este estudo aborda a eficácia percebida da eletroacupuntura facial, técnica da medicina Oriental, para rejuvenescimento facial, promovendo o equilíbrio energético e bem viver de mulheres idosas do Nordeste brasileiro. Para tanto, são analisados as narrativas antes, durante e depois do atendimento, construídas através das entrevistas abertas realizando uma etnoavaliação e a eficácia percebida pelas idosas e os impactos gerados durante e depois da terapia. As fotografias foram analisadas e comparadas proporcionando ao pesquisador ver a diferença do antes e depois da eletroacupuntura facial e as idosas perceberem a diferença dos seus rostos pré e pós-intervenção. O processo terapêutico foi analisado, especialmente o rejuvenescimento facial e a transformação na alma dessas idosas. A eletroacupuntura facial adentra na subjetividade das senhoras participantes da pesquisa; faz uma abordagem holística da saúde destas com seus sentimentos e sofrimentos. A terapêutica favorece o contato mais humanizado, não biomédico, levando as idosas atendidas a se verem mais belas fisicamente e emocionalmente. The {{face is a}} mean {{of communication}} with the society, aging in conformity {{with the way we}} live and where we live. The cloaking of suffering, may increase the process of alterations occurred on the facial skin, such as; flabby cheeks, <b>wrinkles,</b> <b>marks</b> and senile stains. These are only treated externally by the biomedical model, forgetting to investigate within the human being, his emotions, his soul, the vital energy that may contribute to the aging process when unbalanced. The present society appreciates a lot the youth, leaving the senile isolated and low self-esteemed, disregarded, with no right to treat themselves mainly regarding the beauty, by thinking they are already old and ugly. This study approaches the efficiency noticed by the facial electro acupuncture, a oriental medicine technique, for facial rejuvenation, promoting the energetic balance and welfare of senile women from the Brazilian Northeast. For doing so, the narratives are analyzed before, during and after the consultation, built trough the open interviews accomplishing an ethno evaluation and the efficiency noticed by the senile and the impacts generated during and after the therapy. The pictures were analyzed and compared allowing the researcher to see the difference before and after the facial electro acupuncture and the senile women noticed the difference of their faces before and after intervention. The therapeutic process was analyzed, specially the facial rejuvenation and the transformation of the souls of those senile. The facial electro acupuncture enters in the subjective of the participant women of the research; makes a holistic approach of their health with their thoughts and sufferings. The therapeutic favors a more human contact, not biomedical, leading the accommodated senile to look at themselves physically and emotionally prettier...|$|R
40|$|A marca {{corporal}} como registro de existência e a pele como superfície de experiência: o contato como paradigma para as imagens impressas do corpo é uma pesquisa de mestrado em Poéticas Visuais que articula questões provenientes de uma prática artística que é fundamentada em procedimentos gráficos e numa produção textual reflexiva. O objeto de estudo desta pesquisa parte da idéia de inscrição e transferência de imagem, procedimentos encontrados na maioria dos processos ligados à gravura e à fotografia, meios gráficos explorados na prática em questão. Utilizo rugas, marcas e dobras gravadas na superfície da pele para apontar o corpo como superfície de inscrição singular (marcado pelo tempo e pelos acontecimentos vividos por cada um) bem como o gesto que marca, promovido por esse corpo marcado. O fluxo dos procedimentos e dos conceitos adotados na pesquisa aponta para uma poética da experiência, pois encontra no contato, no encontro entre as superfícies/corpos, o mote para a produção e reflexão do presente fazer. Apresento, como resultado da pesquisa, trabalhos/proposições e séries de imagens impressas que têm, como conceito operatório, a impressão da superfície do corpo humano, ou seja, o corpo como matriz para as imagens, bem como o seu gesto como produtor de imagens, pensando o corpo, o humano, como matéria para a produção de imagens, onde o tátil e o visual comungam na experiência artística e em seus resultados. Assim, busco uma crítica às imagens puramente visuais, convidando o “espectador” a contatar as superfícies, os corpos num movimento que procura, através do sentido tátil, a experiência artística heurística. O estudo conduz a aproximações com obras de artistas contemporâneos, com ênfase na produção dos artistas brasileiros Lygia Clark e Hélio Oiticica pelo caráter experimental de suas propostas artísticas; com a filosofia, pelo viés de autores como Gilles Deleuze, Henri Bergson e Walter Benjamin; com a história e crítica da arte, dialogando com ideias traçadas por Didi-Huberman e Mario Pedrosa.

I use <b>wrinkles,</b> <b>marks</b> and folds recorded in the surface of the skin to point the body as surface of singular registration (marked by the time and for the events lived by each one) as well as the gesture that marks, promoted by that marked body. The flow of the procedures and of the concepts adopted in the research appears for a poetic of the experience, because he/she finds in the contact, in the encounter among the surfaces/body, the motto for the production and reflection of the present to do. I present, {{as a result of the}} research, works/propositions and series of images printed that you/they have, as operative concept, the impression of the surface of the human body, in other words, the body as head office for the images, as well as his/her gesture as producing of images, thinking the body, the human, as matter for the production of images, where the tactile and the look take communion in the artistic experience and in their results. Like this, I look for a critic purely to the images visual, inviting the "spectator" to contact the surfaces, the bodies in a movement that seeks, through the tactile sense, the heuristic artistic experience. The study leads to approaches with contemporary artists' works, with emphasis in the Brazilian artists' Lygia Clark production and Hélio Oiticica for the experimental character of their artistic proposals; with the philosophy, for the authors' inclination as Gilles Deleuze, Henri Bergson and Walter Benjamin; with the history and critic of the art, dialoguing with ideas drawn by Didi-Huberman and Mario Pedrosa...|$|R

Mainly cow goat sheep and buffalo leathers are produced in this country. Different defects of leather due to numerous numbers of diseases of animals of poor management of people deteriorate the quality of leather which has negative impact in this sector. This paper analyses the magnitude and category of major defects in case of cow goat and buffalo of Bangladesh. We have studied in sixteen tanneries of Hazaribagh Dhaka where 95 tanneries of the whole country are situated. This study found that in case of cow skin hair slip parasitic skin diseases wound and pox are mainly responsible for the defects in leather in raw condition. Again in case of the wet blue leather of cow flay cut pox mark parasitic diseases growth mark wound sun burn scratch dark mole are responsible for the defects. Further for crust leather of cow flay cut parasitic diseases pox looseness for bating scratch wrinkle grain damage are found as the reason of defects.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} determine the fatigue strength of {{a new type of}} all metal sandwich panel structure, designed and furnished by Western Engineering Associates of Los Angeles. This structure consisted basically of a new type of embossed core attached by spot welding to one or more smooth sheets of the same metal. Specimens tested were all of the single core, single skin type. Metal used was 24 ST aluminum alloy of 0. 032 inch thickness. This construction affords high structural rigidity for its weight. Two patterns of the embossed core were tested. One of the specimens had its core embossed with a triangular pattern, the other with a square pattern. The specimens were tested by utilizing them as simply supported beams, loaded in the center by a sinusoidally varying load of constant maximum magnitude. This load was applied by means of loading bars one {{on the top of the}} specimen, the other on the bottom. These bars had flat, one inch wide surfaces, contacting the specimen. To prevent the sharp edges of the bars from causing local failures of the specimens, a layer of one-eighth inch thick koroseal was used between the bars and the specimen. Specimens tested had a length between end supports of 16. 7 inches. Their width was 9 inches. The loading obtained was a combination of bending and shear. The shear stress was of such a low magnitude, however, that it could be neglected. Failure of the specimens was deemed as occurring at the time the first crack appeared. A method was devised for crack detection that consisted of laying down a conducting strip over a thin insulating layer in a network fashion, covering all saddle points of the core in the central area, since previous testing had disclosed the fact that failure occurred at these points first. Any crack in one of these saddles caused a break in the conducting strip which changed the bias on the controlling electronic tube to a cut off value. This tube was part of an Eccles-Jordan Trigger circuit which with associated tubes allowed current flow through a thyratron relay circuit opening the starting circuit of the testing machine, causing it to stop. The data shows that for the specimens oriented in a normal fashion, that is, with one of the sides of the square or triangle of the core parallel to the loading bar, which was the situation for most of the tests, the square pattern is vastly superior to the triangular one, as regards fatigue strength. For specimens oriented in this way the square pattern withstood a bending moment of 13. 45 inch pounds per inch of width; whereas the triangular pattern withstood only 9. 28. Two tests conducted with the square core having the sides of the squares at an angle of forty-five degrees to the loading bars gave results about midway between. However, the effective EI for this configuration was considerably reduced, and consequently actual failure stress was probably about equal to that for the ease where the sides were parallel to the loading bar. The triangular pattern was actually much worse than the curve shows. At the higher loads cracks occurred with very few cycles of loading. Automatic cut-off feature was not in use for these tests. In service it is highly possible that overloads of short duration might cause small cracks which would become focal points of fatigue failure, thus reducing the fatigue strength well below the design point. This weakness of the triangular pattern arises from the fact that smooth fillets or saddles, joining depressed and elevated portions of the core, are harder to obtain in this pattern than in the square one. <b>Wrinkles</b> and tool <b>marks</b> were present in almost every one of the triangular specimens tested...|$|R
