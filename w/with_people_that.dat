500|$|Before Mulan, American singer Donny Osmond had {{auditioned for}} the lead role of Hercules in Hercules, a role {{for which he was}} {{ultimately}} not cast because the directors felt that is voice sounded [...] "too old" [...] and [...] "too deep" [...] for the character. Osmond later revealed in an interview <b>with</b> <b>People</b> <b>that</b> he was so embarrassed by his Hercules audition that he had nearly considered ending his singing career prematurely. A few months later, Disney contacted Osmond with interest in casting him as the singing voice of Shang after comparing his audition tapes to BD Wong and determining that both actors have [...] "very similar voices." [...] In one scene, Osmond's character, Shang, is hit in the stomach while singing [...] "I'll Make a Man Out of You". In order to sound as realistic as possible, Osmond punched himself in the stomach several times while recording the song.|$|E

500|$|On January 15, 1996, Yankovic began {{recording}} the lead single for the album, [...] "Amish Paradise". Yankovic felt that parodying Coolio would pay off, because Coolio had [...] "such an identifiable image {{that a lot}} of things could be done [...] ". He noted, [...] "I like to play around <b>with</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> have some- you know, a lot of style as opposed to somebody who's kind of homogonized [...] and bland and has no personality, and Coolio certainly kind of sticks out in a crowd." [...] Yankovic felt that juxtaposing the original song's [...] "gangsta" [...] themes with the Amish lifestyle would produce a humorous end result. After Yankovic revealed to his label that he would be doing a Coolio parody, they requested that the album artwork for the release also parody Coolio. Yankovic had been toying with the name Bad Hair Day for a time and felt that he could adequately use the name and lampoon Coolio – who was known for his distinct hair style – at the same time. The final parody recorded for the album, [...] "Syndicated Inc.", is a parody of [...] "Misery" [...] by Soul Asylum, a loving ode to syndicated television.|$|E

For a cohesive sound, Aiken chose Mark 'Kipper' Eldridge to produce the entire album. On My Way Here was released May 6, 2008, on the RCA label.|$|E

2500|$|In February 2009, it was {{reported}} that All Time Low had signed to major label Interscope Records. However, the following month, vocalist/guitarist Alex Gaskarth denied this. The band released their third album, Nothing Personal in July of that year through independent label Hopeless Records, which sold 63,000 copies in its first week of release, debuting at number four on the Billboard 200. The band later confirmed they signed to Interscope Records in November. Guitarist Jack Barakat said signing to the label gave the band [...] "a bunch of new resources", such as being able to [...] "write <b>with</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> we could never write with before, recording with people, getting certain mixers/producers and everything." [...] Gaskarth found the transition [...] " [...] too difficult", but noting that it [...] "definitely different though".|$|E

Whalley argued that gender was irrelevant to the issue, and in response to Sandilands' threat of violence asked Jackie if she was aware that her security guard had threatened a band technician with violence. Sandilands said he endorsed the threat of violence. Sandilands argued to Whalley that he has to [...] "get over it" [...] when Whalley recommended that radio DJs should promote original Australian music. In reply, Sandilands insinuated that Frenzal Rhomb, and bands in general, suffer from a lack of support because they are not [...] "putting [...] stuff in front of the right people".|$|E

[...] He explained that they were working <b>with</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> [...] "didn't have their best interests at heart." [...] Kendricks, however, initially decided to stay in the group because he was worried he would not get the support he needed if he left the group. Kendricks also expressed the fact that his relationship with Berry Gordy was less than cordial.
