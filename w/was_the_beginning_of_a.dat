5|$|A {{network of}} roads {{developed}} in the Lowlands in this period. Drover's roads, between the Highlands and north-east England, had become established {{by the end of}} the seventeenth century and a series of military roads were built and maintained as a response to the Jacobite Risings in the eighteenth century. At the beginning of the period, most farming was based on the Lowland fermtoun or Highland baile, but a system of land ownership based on large estates emerged. This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> process that would create a landscape of rectangular fields and carefully located farm complexes with interconnecting roads.

5|$|Initially {{reassigned to}} 10./JG 1 {{based in the}} Ruhr, he shot down his first Viermot (four-engined bomber), his 7th victory, on 26 February 1943. This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new war for Specht – the 8th USAAF was {{starting}} its bombing offensive on the Reich’s industrial complex.

Jagdgeschwader 11 was a new fighter wing, created in April 1943 by dividing Jagdgeschwader 1 (flying Fw 190s) in half and filling it out into a full wing with new Gruppen flying Me 109G-6 'gunboats', to increase the homeland protection.

5|$|Thespis {{opened on}} Boxing Day {{and ran for}} 63 performances. It outran five of its nine {{competitors}} for the 1871 holiday season, and its run was extended beyond {{the length of a}} normal run at the Gaiety, but no one at the time anticipated that this <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> great collaboration. Unlike the later Gilbert and Sullivan works, it was hastily prepared, and its nature was more risqué, like Gilbert's earlier burlesques, with a broader style of comedy that allowed for improvisation by the actors. Two of the male characters were played by women, whose shapely legs were put on display in a fashion that Gilbert later condemned. The musical score to Thespis was never published and is now lost, except for one song that was published separately, a chorus that was re-used in The Pirates of Penzance, and the Act II ballet music.|$|E
5|$|After the {{supercell}} {{moved through}} Nashville {{and the environment}} became favorable again, a tornado touched down to the southwest of Castalian Springs in Sumner County, Tennessee, just after 10:00 pm CST (0400 UTC). This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> devastating, long-track EF3 tornado that {{would go on to}} kill 22 people and become the deadliest of the outbreak. At the beginning of the path, damage was relatively minor and limited to snapped trees and damaged roofs. However, the tornado rapidly intensified to EF3 strength as it tore directly through Castalian Springs, destroying numerous homes and businesses. The town's post office was completely leveled, mobile homes were obliterated, and several block-foundation homes were leveled or swept away. The 19th century Wynnewood Inn, a national historical landmark and stagecoach stop, suffered major damage to its second floor and grounds during the storm. 11-month old Castalian Springs resident Kyson Stowell survived being thrown from his family's home and carried through the air by the tornado as the structure was completely destroyed. Kyson was found unharmed in an open field, nearly 500 feet away from where he originated. Kyson's mother, Kerri Stowell, was killed in the tornado. A total of 85 homes were destroyed along this portion of the tornado's path. Seven fatalities were confirmed in Castalian Springs, and 14 other people were injured.|$|E
