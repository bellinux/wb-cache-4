5|$|Assuming less {{load and}} rolling friction, Raepsaet, in contrast, calculates a maximum pulling force of 27kN, {{which would have}} needed a {{slightly}} smaller towing crew. Under these circumstances, the use of harnessed oxen—which has been refuted by Tolley {{on the basis of}} their relatively diminished pulling capabilities— <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> feasible. However, the necessary expenditure of energy at the Diolkos must be regarded in both scenarios as considerable.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, {{a physics}} {{professor}} at the University of Central Florida wrote a paper arguing that it is mathematically impossible for vampires to exist, based on geometric progression. According to the paper, if the first vampire had appeared on 1 January 1600, and it fed once a month (which is less often than what is depicted in films and folklore), and every victim turned into a vampire, then within {{two and a half}} years the entire human population of the time <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> vampires.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the {{government}} of India nominated Tharoor for the post of UN Secretary-General. Had he won, the 50-year-old Shashi Tharoor <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> the second-youngest Secretary-General, after the 46-year-old Dag Hammarskjöld. Although all previous Secretaries-General had come from small countries, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and National Security Advisor M. K.

5|$|The {{molluscan}} shell {{appears to}} have originated from a mucus coating, which eventually stiffened into a cuticle.

The first mollusc shell almost certainly was reinforced with the mineral aragonite.|$|E
5|$|As New Orleans {{continues}} {{to recover from}} Hurricane Katrina, various projects have been proposed but increasing material and labor costs have eliminated some. The tallest tower approved for construction in the city was Trump International Hotel & Tower; upon completion it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> the tallest building in New Orleans at a height of , but construction was delayed and eventually cancelled in 2011. Phase 3 of Canal Place is another skyscraper proposed for construction in the city. In addition, while not new constructions, many of the older buildings in the central business district are undergoing renovations to condominium, apartment and hotel towers; these projects include the National American Bank Building.|$|E
5|$|Dodd {{tried to}} follow in the pattern of New Englanders who have entered the race for the Democratic {{nomination}} and won, including John Kerry, Michael Dukakis, and John F. Kennedy. If elected, Dodd <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> the second Roman Catholic president (after Kennedy) and the second Connecticut-born president (after George W. Bush). He would have been the first Senator to win the presidency while in office since Kennedy was elected in 1960 (that honor ultimately went to Barack Obama). After his withdrawal from the race, Dodd went on to endorse the eventual winner Barack Obama, and retired from the Senate in 2011.|$|E

5|$|However, a {{burst of}} intense neutron and gamma {{radiation}} came directly from the fireball. Its lethal radius was , covering {{about half of the}} firestorm area. An estimated 30% of immediate fatalities were people who received lethal doses of this direct radiation, but died in the firestorm before their radiation injuries <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> apparent. Over 6,000 people survived the blast and fire, but died of radiation injuries. Among injured survivors, 30% had radiation injuries from which they recovered, but with a lifelong increase in cancer risk. To date, no radiation-related evidence of heritable diseases has been observed among the survivors' children.|$|E
5|$|In these engagements it {{is claimed}} that a whole Ottoman {{battalion}} was captured or killed. Over 100 Ottoman soldiers were killed. Among the 172 prisoners were many wounded, while the British losses were under 60. It {{had been a}} crucial battle; if El Burj had been captured the British would have lost {{the use of the}} road leading up from Berfilya, and the Beit Nuba–Beit Sira valley <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> untenable. The left flank of the infantry's main advance on Jerusalem would have been exposed, which would have also weakened the pressure being exerted towards the Nablus road.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United {{became the}} first team to win the European Cup or Champions League without being the champions of Europe or champions of their country the {{preceding}} season. They had finished second in the 1997–98 season to Arsenal, but had qualified through UEFA's expanded format, which had been introduced a season earlier. Had Bayern won the cup, they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> {{the first team to}} achieve this feat, having also finished second in the Bundesliga to Kaiserslautern the season before. While Manchester United finished the season as Treble champions, Bayern ultimately lost the DFB-Pokal final to Werder Bremen, which meant they finished the season with the Bundesliga title as their only silverware.|$|E

5|$|McCain {{was born}} in the Panama Canal Zone. Had he been elected, he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> the first {{president}} who was born outside the contiguous forty-eight states. This raised a potential legal issue, since the United States Constitution requires the president to be a natural-born citizen of the United States. A bipartisan legal review, and a unanimous but non-binding Senate resolution, both concluded that he is a natural-born citizen. Also, if inaugurated in 2009 at age 72years and 144days, he would have been the oldest U.S. president upon ascension to the presidency, and the second-oldest president to be inaugurated.|$|E
5|$|The 2012 French Open Men's singles final was the {{championship}} tennis match of the Men's Singles tournament at the 2012 French Open. It pitted the world's top two players, Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal, {{against each other}} in a Grand Slam tournament final for the fifth time overall and fourth consecutive time. This match had historical proportions as Djokovic <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to win all four Majors simultaneously, whereas Nadal was looking to break Björn Borg's record of six French Open titles and equal Chris Evert's record of seven French Open titles held by a man or woman.|$|E
5|$|The {{office of}} Vice President had been vacant sixteen times {{due to the}} death or {{resignation}} of the Vice President or his succession to the presidency. For example, there was no Vice President for nearly {{four years after the}} assassination of Abraham Lincoln. During the impeachment of Andrew Johnson there was no Vice President to succeed him. At that time, the Presidential Succession Act of 1792 provided that the President pro tempore of the Senate would succeed Johnson if he was removed from office. Had the impeachment trial of Andrew Johnson resulted in Johnson being removed from office, Senator Benjamin Wade, then the President pro tempore of the Senate, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> acting president pending a special presidential election.|$|E

5|$|The reasons Paraceratherium became extinct after {{surviving}} {{for about}} 11 million years are unknown, {{but it is}} unlikely that there was a single cause. Theorised reasons include climate change, low reproduction rate, and invasion by gomphothere proboscideans from Africa in the late Oligocene. Gomphotheres may have been able to considerably change the habitats they entered, {{in the same way that}} African elephants do today, by destroying trees and turning woodland into grassland. Once their food source became scarce and their numbers dwindled, Paraceratherium populations <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> more vulnerable to other threats. Large predators like Hyaenaelurus and Amphicyon also entered Asia from Africa during the early Miocene; these may have predated Paraceratherium calves. Other herbivores also invaded Asia during this time.|$|E

In 2012, he was nominated to fill a vacancy on the state's 13th General District Court, which serves Richmond, Virginia. Before the vote, the conservative advocacy group Family Foundation of Virginia lobbied heavily against his nomination due to his homosexuality and past activism. He had served for a time {{on the board of}} Equality Virginia, a gay rights advocacy organization. If his nomination had succeeded, he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> the first openly gay judge in the state.|$|E
5|$|Two {{competing}} hypotheses {{exist in}} Egyptology {{to describe the}} succession of events running from the death of Neferirkare Kakai, the third king of the Fifth Dynasty, to the coronation of Nyuserre Ini, the sixth ruler of the dynasty. Relying on historical sources, where Nyuserre {{is said to have}} directly succeeded Neferefre, many Egyptologists such as Jürgen von Beckerath and Hartwig Altenmüller have traditionally believed that the following succession took place: Neferirkare Kakai → Shepseskare → Neferefre → Nyuserre Ini. In this scenario, Neferefre is the father of Nyuserre, who <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> pharaoh after Neferefre's unexpected death. Neferefre would be the successor of Shepseskare, credited with seven years of reign, as indicated in Manetho's Aegyptiaca.|$|E
