5|$|After the {{departure}} of the Hohokam, groups of Akimel O'odham (commonly known as Pima), Tohono O'odham and Maricopa tribes began to use the area, as well as segments of the Yavapai and Apache. The O'odham were offshoots of the Sobaipuri tribe, who in turn <b>were</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> be the descendants of the formerly urbanized Hohokam.|$|E

5|$|Goodwin {{and colleagues}} {{proposed}} in 1992 that Styracosaurus {{was part of}} the lineage leading to Einiosaurus, Achelousaurus and Pachyrhinosaurus. This was based on a series of fossil skulls from the Two Medicine Formation of Montana. The position of Styracosaurus in this lineage is now equivocal, as the remains that <b>were</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> represent Styracosaurus have been transferred to the genus Rubeosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Japanese-Canadian taiko {{began in}} 1979 with Katari Taiko, and was {{inspired}} by the San Jose Taiko group. Its early membership was predominantly female.

5|$|Like other fairywrens, the red-winged fairywren is {{unrelated}} to the true wrens. Initially fairywrens <b>were</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> {{be a member of}} the old world flycatcher family Muscicapidae or warbler family Sylviidae before being placed in the newly recognised Maluridae in 1975. More recently, DNA analysis has shown the family to be related to Meliphagidae (honeyeaters) and Pardalotidae (peep-wrens) in a large superfamily, Meliphagoidea.|$|E

5|$|On 18 May, the {{strength}} of the Arab Legion deployed around Latrun and Bab al-Wad was sufficient, and the road was blocked again.

5|$|The Harry Potter {{books have}} also gained {{recognition}} for sparking {{an interest in}} reading among the young {{at a time when}} children <b>were</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> be abandoning books for computers and television, although it is reported that despite the huge uptake of the books, adolescent reading has continued to decline.|$|E
5|$|The North Complex is a {{collection}} of several landforms, including craters, that <b>were</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> have been formed by volcanic activity.

5|$|What <b>were</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> be {{fragments}} of Roman pottery tiles {{were found in}} Hale Barns in the 1880s {{near the site of}} what is now St Ambrose College. The artefacts were lost before their antiquity could be confirmed, but led local historian W. Thompson Wakin to suggest there was probably a Roman villa in the area.|$|E
5|$|An {{analysis}} of the invertebrate population in the canopy of Banksia woodland found that mites and ticks (Acari), beetles (Coleoptera) and ants, bees and wasps (Hymenoptera) predominated overall, with the three orders also common on B. ilicifolia, although outnumbered by thrips (Thysanoptera). More arthropods on B. ilicifolia {{might be related to}} a higher nutrient (potassium) level in the leaves. Lower overall numbers of invertebrates on Banksia species <b>were</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> be related to the presence of insectivorous birds.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the agents}} in Coley's Toxin that <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> biologically active is a {{lipopolysaccharide}} which causes fever. [...] The resulting fever from the lipopolysaccaride <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> increase lymphocyte activity and boosts tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Tsung and Norton in Surgical Oncology reported that the active agent <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> interleukin-12, rather than TNF.|$|R

5|$|As stated above, the hydrolytic {{proteins}} Rrp6 and Rrp44 {{are associated}} with the exosome in yeast and in humans, besides Rrp6, two different proteins, Dis3 and Dis3L1 can be associated at the position of the yeast Rrp44 protein. Although originally the S1 domain proteins <b>were</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> have 3'-5' hydrolytic exoribonuclease activity as well, the existence of this activity has recently been questioned and these proteins might have just a role in binding substrates prior to their degradation by the complex.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers {{originally}} {{supposed that}} the entire trans-Neptunian population would show a similar red surface colour, as they <b>were</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> have originated in the same region and subjected to the same physical processes. Specifically, SDOs were expected to have large amounts of surface methane, chemically altered into complex organic molecules by energy from the Sun. This would absorb blue light, creating a reddish hue. Most classical objects display this colour, but scattered objects do not; instead, they present a white or greyish appearance.|$|E
5|$|At one time, stable carbenes <b>were</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> {{reversibly}} dimerise {{through the}} so-called Wanzlick equilibrium. However, imidazol-2-ylidenes and triazol-5-ylidenes are thermodynamically stable {{and do not}} dimerise, and have been stored in solution {{in the absence of}} water and air for years. This is presumably due to the aromatic nature of these carbenes, which is lost upon dimerisation. In fact imidazol-2-ylidenes are so thermodynamically stable that only in highly constrained conditions are these carbenes forced to dimerise.|$|E
50|$|The Selus Stone <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> {{date from}} the late 5th or early 6th-centuries. It bears the Latin {{inscription}} Selus Ic Iacet (Selus lies here). This <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> refer to Salomon of Cornwall, otherwise known as Saint Selevan.|$|R

5|$|Before 2000, {{arguments}} that the Deccan Traps flood basalts caused the extinction were usually {{linked to the}} view that the extinction was gradual, as the flood basalt events <b>were</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> have started around 68Mya and lasted more than 2 million years. The most recent evidence shows that the traps erupted over a period of 800,000 years spanning the Kâ€“Pg boundary, and therefore may be responsible for the extinction and the delayed biotic recovery thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Before 2000, {{arguments}} that the Deccan Traps flood basalts caused the extinction were usually {{linked to the}} view that the extinction was gradual, as the flood basalt events <b>were</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> have started around 68million years ago and lasted for over 2 million years. However, there is evidence that two thirds of the Deccan Traps were created in only 1 million years about 66million years ago, and so these eruptions would have caused a fairly rapid extinction, possibly over a period of thousands of years, but still longer than would be expected from a single impact event.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the climate}} and land of Palestine, {{where most of the}} Bible takes place, were well-suited to growing grapes, and the wine that the {{vineyards}} produced was a valued commodity in ancient times, both for local consumption and for its value in trade. Trade with Egypt was quite extensive. Jews were a wine-drinking culture well before the foundation of Rome. Vintage wines were found in the tomb of King Scorpion in Hierakonpolis. Archaeological evidence suggests that Semitic predecessors <b>were</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> be responsible for the vintages that were found in the tomb. Vineyards were protected from robbers and animals by walls, hedges, and manned watchtowers.|$|E
