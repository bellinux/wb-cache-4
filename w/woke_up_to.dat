5|$|Khánh {{used the}} coup to enact {{retribution}} against Minh's leading generals. Khánh had Kim, Don, Dinh and Xuan arrested, {{claiming that they}} were part of a neutralist plot with the French. Khánh noted that they had served in the Vietnamese National Army in the early 1950s, under the French colonial administration, although he did as well. Lan was also arrested as a suspected French agent. The junta members were caught totally unaware. Minh, Don and Kim <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> find hostile forces surrounding their houses and thought it to be a quixotic stunt by some disgruntled young officers.|$|E
25|$|Khánh overthrew Minh and {{his colleagues}} on 30 January 1964, in a bloodless coup, {{completely}} catching the MRC off guard.

25|$|The {{diversion}} of heavier bombers to the Balkans {{meant that the}} crews and units left behind were asked to fly two or three sorties per night. Bombers were noisy, cold, and vibrated badly. Added to the tension of the mission which exhausted and drained crews, tiredness caught up with and killed many. In one incident on 28/29 April, Peter Stahl of KG 30 was flying on his 50th mission. He fell asleep at the controls of his Ju 88 and <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> discover the entire crew asleep. He roused them, ensured they took oxygen and Dextro-Energen tablets, then completed the mission.|$|E

25|$|As Vijaya and Kuveni were sleeping, he <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> {{sounds of}} music and singing. Kuveni {{informed}} him that the island was home to Yakkhas, who would kill her for giving shelter to Vijaya's men. She explained that the noise was because of wedding festivities in the Yakkha city of Sirisavatthu. With Kuveni's help, Vijaya defeated the Yakkhas. Vijaya and Kuveni had two children: Jivahatta and Disala. Vijaya established a kingdom, which was named Tambapanni ("copper-red hands"), because the men's hands were redenned by the red soil of the area. The {{members of the community}} established by Vijaya were called Sinhala after Sinhabahu.|$|E
25|$|On 17 November 2002, the {{oil tanker}} Prestige split {{in half and}} sank in the Atlantic Ocean, after having had a huge leak in its tanks. A few days later, Man <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> find his life ruined by an oil spill. Tons of oil had washed {{up on the beach}} where he lived. Most of his sculptures were irremediably {{destroyed}} and the oil even reached his house. Man was absolutely devastated, his whole life work destroyed before his eyes, and the natural environment where he lived heavily polluted for years to come. A month later, he was found dead in his hut. He had circulatory and respiratory problems, but most local people believe that he died of melancholy and sadness {{at the sight of the}} complete and utter destruction of his life by the oil spill. The Camelle authorities organized and paid for his funeral, and hundreds of locals attended.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 29 January, Khiêm ordered troops to assume their {{positions}} around Saigon, including armored cars and tanks and some elements from the 5th and 7th Divisions. Khánh then went to sleep. Khánh headed to the staff headquarters, where {{he saw that the}} compound was empty apart from a few guards. When he telephoned Khiêm, he found that his co-conspirator had overslept after having forgotten to set his alarm clock. Despite this, by daybreak, Khánh had taken over without a shot being fired. Generals Dương Văn Minh, Trần Văn Đôn and Lê Văn Kim <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> find Khiêm's men surrounding their houses and thought it to be a quixotic stunt by some disgruntled young officers, having had no inkling of the plot. Khánh put them under house arrest, later charging them with neutralism. In a morning radio broadcast Khánh said he had conducted the coup because of the junta's failure to make progress against the Viet Cong. After the coup, Khiêm became Defense Minister and the Chairman of Joint General Staff while serving on the junta.|$|E

25|$|Nowell {{was married}} to Troy Dendekker on May 18, 1996. Seven days later, {{on the morning of}} May 25, Sublime was {{supposed}} to begin a five-day tour through Northern California, followed by a European and East Coast tour. However, while the band was staying at the Ocean View Motel in San Francisco, drummer Bud Gaugh <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> find Nowell lying {{on the floor next to}} his bed. His dalmatian, Lou Dog, was curled up on the bed whimpering. Bradley had tried waking up his fellow band-mates to go to the beach with him that morning, but they were too hung-over and tired to get out of bed. Initially, Gaugh assumed Nowell was too intoxicated to get into bed; however, he noticed a green film around his mouth, and it became apparent he had overdosed on heroin. Gaugh called for paramedics, but Nowell had died several hours earlier, and was pronounced dead at the scene. Nowell was cremated and his ashes were spread over his favorite surfing spot in Surfside, California. A headstone was placed at Westminster Memorial in Westminster, California in his memory.|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{following}} {{the release of}} Californication, the band embarked on a world tour to support the record, beginning in the United States. To culminate the US leg of their tour, the Chili Peppers were asked to close Woodstock '99, which became infamous for the resulting violence. The band was informed minutes before arriving that the crowds and bonfires in the fields {{had gone out of}} control. When the Chili Peppers performed a tribute to Jimi Hendrix's song [...] "Fire" [...] to finish their set as a favor to Hendrix's sister, the disruption escalated into violence when several women, who had been crowd surfing and moshing, were raped and nearby property was looted and destroyed. Kiedis felt that [...] "It was clear that this situation {{had nothing to do with}} Woodstock any more. It wasn't symbolic of peace and love, but of greed and cashing in... We <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> papers and radio stations vilifying us for playing 'Fire'." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} opens with Williams waking up {{on a couch}} next to an unnamed {{sleeping}} male and writes a note that says [...] "I'm sorry". From there she walks to a room and hugs her father, who's mentioned in song. A conversation ensues with Williams taking a photo of someone presumed to be her mother. The video continues with Williams in her room staring at the photo on a mirror, singing about how love, [...] "does not exist." [...] She moves through a costume closet and into a restaurant set, where a rotating cast of men pose as her date. Then into the next room, there's a wedding — everyone is wearing white (the other band members in attendance), but Williams comes dressed in black; she flees the scene from where the bride enters. During the chorus of the song, the clip cuts to the scenes where Williams is lying down on a giant pile of Valentine-themed cards. Throughout the video, clips of Williams singing {{with the rest of}} Paramore in a dim-lighted background are shown. In the video's final moments, Williams spots the same male she <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> {{at the beginning of the}} video in the crowd at a rock show. After fantasizing of the two being together through all sets from the start of the video, she makes her way back through the various rooms to the original set in the beginning. When Williams sings [...] "And I'm on my way to believing", she returns to the couch where the male is still asleep, and hides the note she wrote in her pocket as she lies back down next to him.|$|E

2500|$|Although Orange Man was {{produced}} in 1991, it is not believed to have aired on British television until 1992 on television channels such as ITV and Channel 4, where it became the first advertisement in the [...] "You Know When You've Been Tango'd" [...] campaign, which would continue until 1996 before being revived from 2002–2005.

2500|$|Following {{the loss}} of Sicily and most of {{southern}} Italy, the Byzantine Empire collapsed {{into a state of}} petty inter-governmental strife.

The Byzantines <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> this threat under Romanos IV, co-emperor from 1068 to 1071. At the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, the Byzantines were defeated by Alp Arslan, head of the Great Seljuq Empire. This defeat, coupled with a civil war, brought most of the Asia Minor under the rule of the Seljuq Turks by 1091.|$|E

2500|$|World War II {{had left}} the city of Berlin 100 miles deep within East German territory, {{controlled}} by the Soviet Union, and divided into Soviet, British, French, and United States zones of occupation, administered under local agreements which did not guarantee Western access to the city. Responding {{to a series of}} Soviet actions in 1948, the three western allies consolidated their zones and formed the city of West Berlin. [...] For fifteen years the western powers maintained a tenacious hold on West Berlin under periodic harassment of the Soviets. [...] On 13 August 1961, Berliners <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> find they lived in a divided city. A wall now separated East Berlin from West Berlin.

2500|$|In May 1974 {{they were}} on tour again around England and Europe with Captain Beefheart. It was during this tour that Henry Cow <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> {{the reality of what}} was {{happening}} to them: they were becoming a rock band, playing the same thing night after night. Life was no longer a challenge and they were becoming complacent. After some serious thinking they decided to ask Lindsay Cooper to leave and fulfilled their last outstanding concert obligations (a tour of the Netherlands) as a quartet. Without Cooper they were forced to abandon much of their learned material and worked up a 35–40 minute piece unlike anything else they had done before (this later became the politically charged [...] "Living in the Heart of the Beast" [...] on In Praise of Learning).|$|E

However, the sailor was courageous enough to fight the creature, and saw it off with an axe. It is said that where he killed the trow, the grass turned a light green. This was not the only trow by any means, and there is another story of a Yell woman coming upon a family of trowes, who later <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> find one in the house, asking who he was, he said [...] "I am Trippa's son".
