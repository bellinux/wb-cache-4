5|$|When {{the first}} state {{highways}} were signed {{in the field in}} 1919, M-53 <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> running from Detroit to Elkton. In the 1920s, the highway was extended northward to connect with Port Austin. Later improvements through 1940 realigned a section of the roadway near Imlay City and completed paving. With planning and construction during the 1950s and 1960s, the state converted portions of the road north of Detroit to have divided highway and freeway segments. The freeway bypass of Romeo was started in the 1990s and finished to its current state in 2003.|$|E

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{repatriate}} Koga's body, American author Jim Rearden led a search on Akutan in 1988. He located Koga's grave, but found it empty. Rearden and Japanese businessman Minoru Kawamoto conducted a records search. They found that in 1947 Koga's body was exhumed by an American Graves Registration Service team and re-buried on Adak Island, further down the Aleutian chain. The team, unaware of Koga's identity, marked his body as unidentified. The Adak cemetery was excavated in 1953, and 236 bodies were returned to Japan. The body buried next to Koga (Shigeyoshi Shindo) was one of 13 identified; the remaining 223 unidentified remains were re-interred in Chidorigafuchi National Cemetery in Japan. It is probable that Koga <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> Rearden later wrote the definitive account of the Akutan Zero.|$|E
5|$|The {{publication}} in 1972 of Lost Canals of England and Wales, {{a book by}} Ronald Russell, resulted {{in a number of}} canal restoration societies being formed. The Stroudwater Canal Society <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> which was renamed the Stroudwater, Thames and Severn Canal Trust in April 1975 as the scope of the project expanded, and became the Cotswold Canals Trust in July 1990. Although the Proprietors were initially hostile to the Trust, attitudes changed, and in 1979 granted them permission to start work on the section from Pike Mill Bridge to Ryeford, so that a trip-boat could be used on it. As attitudes changed, the Proprietors bought back sections of the waterway which had previously been sold off.|$|E

When the 1950 season began, the New York Yankees had five holdouts (players who wanted more money and would not sign their contracts). Groth <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> and was the only minor leaguer to hold out. He eventually signed his contract with Kansas City, and after spring training ended, Groth {{was sent to the}} Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League, the Yankees' AAA minor league affiliate. The Yankees sent Groth to the Oaks to make up for sending over George Earl Toolson last season, who the Oaks had to return because his condition was poor. Groth finished the season with a 7–11 record and a 5.09 ERA. In January 1951, the Oaks sold Groth to the Baltimore Orioles of the International League, now a farm team of the Philadelphia Phillies. He struggled in ten appearances, finishing with an ERA of 7.58, and was sent to the Chattanooga Lookouts, the AA minor league team of the Washington Senators. He pitched in 26 games for the Lookouts, finishing with a 3–8 record and a 6.29 ERA.|$|E
