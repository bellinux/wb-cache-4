5|$|Gunn {{feels the}} peak of his playing career was making <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>the</b> save of his life in the UEFA Cup match against Bayern Munich in 1993. This event was called the summit of Norwich City's history by The Independent. He is one of only nine Norwich players to win the club's Player of the Year award twice. He was made an inaugural member of Norwich City's Hall of Fame. He {{was a member of the}} Scotland {{national}} football team, making six appearances for his country in the early 1990s.|$|E
25|$|September 25 – President Saakashvili condemns <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>the</b> {{continuing}} {{annexation of}} Georgian lands by Russian troops while addressing the United Nations General Assembly as the Russian military continues to install barbed-wire fences {{to mark out}} new areas claimed by breakaway South Ossetia.|$|E
5000|$|Within Christian teachings, {{the comment}} by Harris {{regarding}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> self-limiting nature of prayer had been addressed years before by multiple authors.

25|$|Extraversion and Neuroticism in the Big Five {{are very}} similar to Eysenck's traits of the same name. However, <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>the</b> trait of Psychoticism {{corresponds}} to two traits in the Big Five model: Conscientiousness and Agreeableness (Goldberg & Rosalack 1994). Eysenck's personality system did not address Openness to experience. He argued that his approach was a better description of personality.|$|E
25|$|In Rationality in Action (2001), Searle {{argues that}} {{standard}} notions of rationality are badly flawed. According to <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>the</b> Classical Model, rationality {{is seen as}} something like a train track: you get on at one point with your beliefs and desires and the rules of rationality compel {{you all the way}} to a conclusion. Searle doubts this picture of rationality holds generally.|$|E
25|$|On 10 March 2008, in the Irish Independent, he {{repeated}} {{his call for}} a lower age of consent to end the criminalisation of young people engaged in consenting sex and to remove the legal obstacles to upfront sex education, condom provision and safer sex advice. In 1998 and 2008, he supported relaxation of the then strict laws against pornography, arguing that pornography can have some social benefits, and he has criticised <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>the</b> body-shame phobia against nudism, suggesting that nudity may be natural and healthy for society.|$|E

25|$|Lomborg concludes {{his book}} by once again {{reviewing}} the Litany, and {{noting that the}} real {{state of the world}} is much better than the Litany claims. According to Lomborg, this discrepancy poses a problem, as it focuses public attention on relatively unimportant issues, while ignoring those that are paramount. In the worst case, The Skeptical Environmentalist argues, the global community is pressured to adopt inappropriate policies which have adverse effects on humanity, wasting resources that could be put to better use in aiding poor countries or fighting diseases such as AIDS. Lomborg thus urges us to look at <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>the</b> true problems of the world, since solving those will also solve the Litany.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1990s, much of Chomsky's {{research}} has focused on <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>the</b> Minimalist Program (MP), in which he departs from much of his past research and instead attempts to simplify language into a system that relates meaning and sound using the minimum possible faculties that could be expected, given certain external conditions that are imposed on us independently. Chomsky dispenses with concepts such as 'deep structure' and 'surface structure' and instead places emphasis on the plasticity of the brain's neural circuits, along with which comes an infinite number of concepts, or 'Logical Forms'. When exposed to linguistic data, the brain of a hearer-speaker then proceeds to associate sound and meaning, and the rules of grammar that we observe are in fact only the consequences, or side effects, of the way that language works. Thus, while much of Chomsky's prior {{research has}} focused on the rules of language, he now focuses on the mechanisms that the brain uses to create these rules.|$|E

500|$|To begin with, Russell is {{interested}} in classifying the {{different ways in which}} one human being may have power over another — <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>the</b> [...] "forms of power".

500|$|Carlsen's endgame prowess {{has been}} {{described}} as among the greatest in history. Jon Speelman, analysing several of Carlsen's endgames from the 2012 London Classic (in particular, his wins against McShane, Aronian, and Adams), described <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Carlsen effect": ...through the combined force of his skill and no less important his reputation, he drives his opponents into errors.... He plays on for ever, calmly, methodically and, perhaps most importantly of all, without fear: calculating superbly, with very few outright mistakes and a good proportion of the [...] "very best" [...] moves. This makes him a monster and makes many opponents wilt.|$|E
500|$|Donald C. Willis, {{a writer}} who wrote about horror and science fiction films, {{described}} the horror scenes as completely lacking suspense, and said the film was [...] "so flimsy that its three co-plots seem to be operating independently of one another". Keith Brown of the University of Edinburgh, in his paper [...] "Notes on the Terror Film", argued that The Brute Man {{is an example of}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>the</b> [...] "terror film", a genre distinguishable from the horror film due to its emphasis on naturally occurring sources of fear, rather than fantastical or otherworldly horror elements. Brown wrote that the Creeper character [...] "blurs the boundary between human and animal on account of his grotesque, deformed features, but is natural and thus a figure of terror".|$|E
500|$|American Creation {{consists}} of a foreword, six chapters, and an afterword. In the prologue, Ellis discusses <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>the</b> [...] "stunning achievement" [...] of the Founders in creating a nation that became [...] "the accepted global formula for national success". He criticizes the [...] "wildly extravagant claims and equally hyperbolic counterclaims" [...] that deify or vilify the Founders, particularly those of academic historians who treat the Founders as [...] "racists, classists, and sexists". In contrast, Ellis states his intention to present a balanced portrayal of Foundersacknowledging their successes, such as {{the creation of a}} nation-sized, secular republic governed by political parties, as well as their failures to deal with slavery and to reach a just settlement with Native Americans.|$|E

500|$|The South African {{historian}} Jakkie Cilliers, {{writing about}} the Rhodesian Bush War, comments on the gulf between <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Malaya clique" [...] and those lower-ranking Rhodesian soldiers in the field, the latter of whom underestimated {{the threat posed by}} the nationalist campaigns, having not previously encountered an insurgency situation. From the mid-1970s, officers such as Walls attempted to impress upon their contemporaries the similarity between the Rhodesian situation and the one they had experienced in Malaya. Operations in Malaya had been coordinated nationally, while in Rhodesia the Army, Air Force and Police were sometimes at odds with each other. To resolve this the Rhodesians created a supreme body called Combined Operations in 1977, influenced by similar posts in Malaya, with Walls at its head.|$|E
500|$|For one, Cobb has {{stressed}} the {{problems inherent in}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>the</b> “substantialist” worldview—ultimately derived from Classical Greek philosophy—that still dominates Christian theology, {{as well as most}} of western thought. [...] This [...] "substantialist" [...] way of thinking necessitates a mind-matter dualism, in which matter and mind are two fundamentally different kinds of entities. [...] It also encourages seeing relations between entities as being unimportant to what the entity is [...] "in itself." [...] In contrast to this view, Cobb follows Whitehead in attributing primacy to events and processes rather than substances. [...] In this Whiteheadian view, nothing is contained within its own sharp boundaries. [...] In fact, the way in which a thing relates to other things is what makes it [...] "what it is." [...] Cobb writes: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{composer}} suffered {{some health}} setbacks around 2004. Meat Loaf says that [...] "lawyers worked {{for over a}} year putting together a contract for Steinman to do Bat Out of Hell III.

[...] Ultimately, according to the singer, Steinman was not well enough to work on such an intense project and made <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>the</b> [...] "selfish" [...] decision to go ahead without him. In promotional interviews he said that he did not want to wait a year and a half just to find out that Steinman was still unfit. Describing himself as a [...] "really loyal [...] person," [...] Meat Loaf says that [...] "the decision not to use Steinman has taken its toll on me." ...|$|E
