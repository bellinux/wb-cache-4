40|$|The {{problem of}} control of a wind power {{generator}} in cases when voltage sags occur in the electric power system {{is presented in the}} paper. Double <b>fed</b> <b>machine</b> (DFM) used as the generator in the wind power plant is considered. The stator of the DFM is connected to the grid and the cascade of power electronic inverters supplies the rotor. When the voltage drop or sag occurs in the power network, controllers of the cascade of power electronic inverters can work incorrectly. In this case, the wind power generators are disconnected in present solutions. Results of simulation of the system with models of the double <b>fed</b> <b>machine,</b> the grid transformer and the inverters are presented in the paper. To control the generated power the structure based on a multiscalar model of the DFM was used. Proposed solution of control makes it possible to keep the power plant in the power system during required time.

40|$|Compared to the doubly <b>fed</b> <b>machine,</b> the {{brushless}} doubly <b>fed</b> <b>machine</b> (BDFM) {{has high}} reliability and low maintenance requirements.

A new control strategy called synthetic vector direct torque control (SVDTC) is proposed to solve the losing control problems of the conventional direct torque control (DTC). Finally, the correctness of the results of this paper is verified by calculation examples and simulation results, the losing control problems can be solved, and the theoretical output capacity limits can be reached using SVDTC...|$|R

40|$|The {{brushless}} doubly <b>fed</b> reluctance <b>machine</b> (BDFRM) {{is related}} to the better known brushless doubly <b>fed</b> induction <b>machine</b> (BDFIM). Research into doubly <b>fed</b> <b>machines</b> is motivated {{by the fact that they}} allow the use of a partially rated inverter in many variable-speed applications. Research into the BDFRM has been largely ignored in comparison to the BDFIM, despite the fact that it has the potential for greater efficiency as compared to the BDFIM, and the rotor is simpler to manufacture. This paper compares the BDFRM and its singly fed cousin, the synchronous reluctance machine. This is a natural comparison since both machines use the same reluctance rotor. The first part of the paper establishes relationships between the inductances of the two machines. This is then used to facilitate a comparison using the constraints that both machines have the same amount of active material, i. e., the same amount of copper and iron, and that the copper losses for both machines are the same. This analysis also allows an approximate comparison with the conventional squirrel-cage induction machine. The analysis is carried out using machine-independent normalization...|$|R

40|$|The doubly <b>fed</b> <b>machine</b> {{is similar}} to the slip ring {{induction}} motor except that both the stator and the rotor are simultaneously supplied with polyphase a. c. The machine develops a synchronous torque at a certain speed (called the 'speed of synchronous operation'), which is proportional to the sum or the difference of the frequencies of the two supplies (depending on the relative phase sequence). When operating synchronously, the machine exhibits several attributes, the most important of which is its ability to act as a variable speed drive (speed variation is caused by variation of one of the supply frequencies) wiith a speed-independent-of-load characteristic. It is, however, unstable at certain speeds. This work uses methods similar to that of Prescott and Raju (Proc. I. E. E. 1958) to analyse the doubly <b>fed</b> <b>machine.</b> An equation is produced relating the speed of synchronous operation of the machine to its supply frequencies and the machine is assumed to operate at (or about) this speed. Equations are also produced, using the method of superimposition, relating the various currents, emf's and torques in the machine to the machine parameters and to the supply voltages and frequencies. This is done {{in such a way that}} studies of the dynamic behaviour of the machine could be made. Workers in the past have either defined the ratio of the rotor voltage to the stator voltage in an arbitrary manner or just tried several values. In seeking an equation to define this ratio is it sensible to stipulate the condition that the minimum current (for that load-speed combination) should be drawn from the supplies. This stipulation resolves into two criteria: one of unity power factor in the stator supply and one of unity power factor in the rotor supply, which can be expressed mathematically as two equations. Only one of these criteria may be used at any one time (the choice of which one to use depends on practial rather than theoretical considerations). The machine is now completely specified. To verify the validity of the various expressions, a series of experiments and computer simulations were executed. (The latter being based on the expressions with the parameters of the test machine, used in the former, as data.) The results of these experiments and computer simulations did not only show good agreement between practice and theory but also showed that several advantages ensued from the use of a unity power factor criterion. These advantages are: an increase in the stable speed range of the machine, an increase in efficiency, a possible increase in the usable torque range (at any particular speed), a reduction in the currents drawn from the supplies. These advantages are suggested by qualitative arguments, which use the similarities between the doubly <b>fed</b> <b>machine</b> and its, more well known, special cases. The analysis mentioned above was required to quantify them. The performance of the doubly <b>fed</b> <b>machine</b> under conditions of unity power factor (both stator and rotor power factor conditions), and the variation OF the rotor voltage (for a fixed stator voltage) to maintain these conditions, form the latter part of the work. Comparisons are also made between unity power factor conditions and non unity power factor conditions. The final part of the project was the building and testing of a simple feedback device designed to automatically adjust the rotor voltage to maintain unity stator power factor for all speeds and torques. Many practical difficulties were overcome by using this device including those associated with the starting and synchronising of the machine...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1991 A new and {{improved}} stabilizer was developed for the variable speed generation (VSG) system. The VSG system exhibits periodic oscillations which sometimes leads {{to a loss of}} synchronism. After careful study, a simple but effective strategy to stabilize the system was implemented with real time digital feedback control. The VSG system consists of an engine, which is the prime mover, driving a doubly <b>fed</b> <b>machine</b> (DFM), which is the generator. The stator of the DFM is directly connected to the grid while the rotor is connected to the grid through a power electronic converter. The converter used in this study is a series resonance converter (SRC), but the proposed method may also be applied to other kinds of converters. The stabilizer senses the RPM of the engine, the feedback signal, and controls the rotor current amplitude and frequency of the doubly <b>fed</b> <b>machine.</b> Control was implemented using the 80 C 196 KB microcontroller. The software consists of a mix of "C" and assembly language. Speed being an important factor in the implementation, care was taken to minimize the control loop times.
