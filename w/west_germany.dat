Being fluent in German, Conant {{was able to give}} speeches to German audiences. He paid numerous visits to German educational and scientific organizations.|$|E
5|$|Each year, the Academy invites {{countries}} {{to submit their}} best films for competition according to strict rules, with only one film being accepted from each country. However, because of Germany's status as a divided country {{throughout much of the}} second half of the 20th century, <b>West</b> <b>Germany</b> and East Germany competed separately in the Best Foreign Language Film category until 1990. With eight nominations and one win, <b>West</b> <b>Germany</b> was far more successful than East Germany, whose only nomination was received in 1976 for Jacob the Liar, a film which the Moscow International Film Festival had refused to screen. <b>West</b> <b>Germany</b> received four consecutive nominations during the first years of the award's existence. It fared less well in the 1960s, as all of its submissions failed to garner a nomination. The advent of New German Cinema led to an improvement of German cinema's reputation abroad. As a result of this, <b>West</b> <b>Germany</b> received several nominations during the 1970s, culminating with The Tin Drums victory in 1979.|$|E
