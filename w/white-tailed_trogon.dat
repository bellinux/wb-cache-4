50|$|This species {{resembles the}} <b>white-tailed</b> <b>trogon,</b> but {{the latter is}} larger and has a {{complete}} pale blue eye-ring in both sexes. Furthermore, the male <b>white-tailed</b> <b>trogon</b> lacks barring to the undertail.|$|E
50|$|The {{song of the}} <b>white-tailed</b> <b>trogon</b> {{consists}} of 15-20 very fast cow notes.|$|E
50|$|There is no {{overlap in}} the {{distribution}} of the white-tailed and green-backed trogons, but the two can be separated by the undertail pattern: Unlike the <b>white-tailed</b> <b>trogon,</b> the male green-backed trogon has a broad black base to each feather, and the female has relatively distinct black-and-white barring mainly to the outer webs of each feather. The male <b>white-tailed</b> <b>trogon</b> also has a bluer rump than the green-backed trogon.|$|E
5000|$|They {{typically}} perch {{upright and}} motionless. Although their flight is fast, they {{are reluctant to}} fly any distance. Their broad bills and weak legs reflect their diet and arboreal habits. <b>White-tailed</b> <b>trogons</b> feed mainly on small fruit, supplemented by arthropods [...] - [...] slightly more so in the dry season when fruit are scarce.|$|R
50|$|The green-backed trogon (Trogon viridis), {{also known}} as the Amazonian <b>white-tailed</b> <b>trogon,</b> is a near {{passerine}} bird in the trogon family. It is found in tropical humid forests in South America, where its range includes the Amazon, the Guiana Shield, Trinidad, and the Atlantic Forest in eastern Brazil. It formerly included T. chionurus of the Chocó region as a subspecies, but under the common name <b>white-tailed</b> <b>trogon</b> (a name now reserved for T. chionurus).|$|E
50|$|The <b>white-tailed</b> <b>trogon</b> (Trogon chionurus) is a near {{passerine}} {{bird in the}} trogon family. It {{is found}} in tropical humid forests of the Chocó, ranging from Panama, through western Colombia, to western Ecuador. It was formerly considered a subspecies of T. viridis, which is widespread in South America east of the Andes, but under the English name <b>white-tailed</b> <b>trogon</b> (a name now reserved for T. chionurus, leaving T. viridis as the green-backed trogon).|$|E
50|$|There is no {{overlap in}} the {{distribution}} of the green-backed and white-tailed trogons, but the two can be separated by the undertail pattern: Unlike the green-backed trogon, the male <b>white-tailed</b> <b>trogon</b> only has a very narrow black base to each feather (the undertail appears almost entirely white), and the female mainly has black-and-white barring to the inner webs of each feather (can be difficult to see). The male <b>white-tailed</b> <b>trogon</b> also has a bluer rump than the green-backed trogon.|$|E
50|$|The {{song of the}} green-backed trogon {{consists}} of about 20 cow notes that start slow, but accelerate towards the end. The song is slower than the <b>white-tailed</b> <b>trogon,</b> and higher pitched than the black-tailed trogon.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} {{to the thousands of}} varieties of insects like Trosia Dimas and Lonomia Obliqua, there are over a hundred species of indigenous birds that occupy the grounds of AkahtiLândia such as the Green-headed tanager, Green-billed toucan, Squirrel cuckoo, Brazilian tanager, Blue-and-yellow tanager. <b>White-tailed</b> <b>trogon,</b> the Blue-winged parrotlet, etc.|$|E
50|$|This {{relatively}} large trogon is 28 to 30 cm long. As most trogons, it is strongly sexually dimorphic. In the male {{the head and}} upper breast are dark blue (appears blackish in poor light), and the back is green, becoming bluer on the rump. The lower underparts are orange-yellow. The wings are black, vermiculated with white. The undertail is almost entirely white with only a very narrow black base to each feather. The complete eye-ring is pale bluish. The female <b>white-tailed</b> <b>trogon</b> resembles the male, but has a grey back, head and breast, and rather indistinct black-and-white barring mainly to the inner webs of each tail feather (less on outer webs).|$|E
50|$|The park {{is popular}} with birdwatchers {{due to its}} {{abundance}} of bird species; some 525 bird species are found here. Pipeline Road extends for 17.5 km north-south through the park and passes through old-growth and secondary forest.

Birds regularly seen along Pipeline Road include double-toothed kite, slaty-backed forest-falcon, orange-chinned parakeet, brown-hooded parrot, blue-headed parrot, red-lored parrot, squirrel cuckoo, white-necked jacobin, violet-bellied hummingbird, crowned woodnymph, blue-chested hummingbird, <b>white-tailed</b> <b>trogon,</b> gartered trogon, black-throated trogon, black-tailed trogon, slaty-tailed trogon, black-mandibled toucan, keel-billed toucan, collared aracari, black-cheeked woodpecker, cinnamon woodpecker, crimson-crested woodpecker, white-whiskered puffbird, broad-billed motmot, rufous motmot, northern barred woodcreeper, cocoa woodcreeper, black-striped woodcreeper, fasciated antshrike, black-crowned antshrike, checker-throated antwren, dot-winged antwren, white-flanked antwren, spotted antbird, bicolored antbird, ocellated antbird, chestnut-backed antbird, black-faced antthrush, southern bentbill, brownish twistwing, olivaceous flatbill, ruddy-tailed flycatcher, bright-rumped attila, purple-throated fruitcrow, red-capped manakin, blue-crowned manakin, golden-collared manakin, bay wren, song wren, gray-headed tanager, white-shouldered tanager, red-throated ant-tanager, blue-black grosbeak, scarlet-rumped cacique, and yellow-rumped cacique.|$|E
50|$|Kanashen {{houses the}} {{headwaters}} of the Essequibo River, Guyana’s principal water source, and encompasses the southern portion of its watershed, which drains the Kassikaityu, Kamoa, Sipu and Chodikar rivers. The main mountains are the Wassarai, Yahore, Komoa and Kaiawakua, with elevations up to about 1200 metres above sea level. Except for its flora, the biology of the Kanashen district is relatively unstudied. Botanically, the area has many species found only in the area and is covered by four general vegetation types, which have remained almost completely intact. The main vegetation types are tall evergreen highland forest and tall/medium evergreen lower montane forest. There are also small areas of tall evergreen flooded riparian forest and lowland shrub savanna. Species such as Manyokinaballi (Geissospermum spp.) and Kakaralli (Eschweilera) are the most common of the 192 species recorded. The area also contains important fauna such as giant river otters (Pteronura brasiliensis), the cock of the rock (Rupicola rupicola), the giant harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja) and other animals that support the livelihood of the Wais-Wais. Three globally threatened species inhabit the COCA: the Giant Armadillo (Priodontes maximus), one of the Harlequin Toads (Atelopus spumarius) and the Brazilian Tapir (tapirus terrestris). The Giant Anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), jaguars (Panthera onca), labba (Agouti paca), peccary (Tayassu spp.) and forest deer (Mazama spp.) are also known to occur in the area. Results of community-based bird surveys at three sites recorded 117 species, approximately 16% {{of the total number of}} species recorded in Guyana. This number was increased by an additional 100 species identified during a rapid biological assessment study. Some of the birds present in the COCA are the Screaming Piha (Lipaugus vociferans), <b>White-tailed</b> <b>Trogon</b> (Trogon viridis), Painted Parakeet (Pyrrhura picta), Golden-headed Manakin (Pipra erythrocephala), several species of parrots and macaw including the Scarlet (Ara macao), Red Shouldered (Diopsittaca nobilis) and Blue and Yellow (Ara ararauna) Macaws, and species of antbirds (Thamnophilidae) and toucans (Ramphastidae).|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn adult female <b>white-tailed</b> <b>trogon</b> (Trogon viridis) was {{presented}} with abdominal enlargement and hard subcutaneous masses. Necropsy findings included bony masses extending from skeletal structures, disseminated pale foci in the liver, and a pale mass in the kidney. Histological examination revealed multifocal to coalescing granulomatous inflammation in bone, liver, kidney, lung and spleen. Mycobacterium celatum was isolated from the liver and identified by DNA sequencing. This is the first report of M. celatum infection in an avian species...|$|E
40|$|Mycobacterium celatum, a slowly growing {{potentially}} pathogenic mycobacterium {{first described}} in humans, {{is regarded as}} an uncommon cause of human infection, though capable of inducing invasive disease in immunocompromised hosts. According to some reports, a serious disease due to M. celatum may also occur in individuals with no apparent immunodeficiency. In animals, an M. celatum-related disease has been described in three cases only: twice in a domestic ferret (Mustela putorius furo) {{and once in a}} <b>white-tailed</b> <b>trogon</b> (Trogon viridis). In this paper, we report the first detection of M. celatum in a domestic pig (Sus scrofa domestica) and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus). A nation-wide overview of human M. celatum infections recorded in Slovenia between 2000 and 2010 is also given. Pulmonary disease due to M. celatum was recognized in one patient with a history of a preexisting lung disease...|$|E
40|$|Two {{new species}} of Brueelia are {{described}} and illustrated. These new species and their type hosts are: Brueelia sueta ex Pharomachrus pavoninus (Spix, 1824), the Pavonine Quetzal and Brueelia cicchinoi ex Trogon viridis Linnaeus, the <b>White-tailed</b> <b>Trogon.</b> Both new species differ from the only Brueelia described on Trogon mexicanus by many morphological features, including those present in the male genitalia and female vulvar margin. Partial sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene for these two new species differ from one another by 13. 6 % uncorrected p-distance. Whereas B. cicchinoi is only 0. 3 % divergent from previously published COI sequences identified as Brueelia sp. from the Mexican T. melanocephalus Gould, 1936 and T. massena Gould, 1938. We also found B. cicchinoi on T. melanurus, T. collaris and Pharomachrus pavoninus. Thus B. cicchinoi is found on multiple trogoniform hosts across an extremely large geographic distribution and {{has one of the}} largest number of host associations among Brueelia species...|$|E
40|$|We report three {{developments}} toward {{resolving the}} challenge of the apparent basal polytomy of neoavian birds. First, we describe improved conditional down-weighting techniques to reduce noise relative to signal for deeper divergences and find increased agreement between data sets. Second, we present formulae for calculating the probabilities of finding predefined groupings in the optimal tree. Finally, we report a significant increase in data: nine new mitochondrial (mt) genomes (the dollarbird, New Zealand kingfisher, great potoo, Australian owlet-nightjar, <b>white-tailed</b> <b>trogon,</b> barn owl, a roadrunner [a ground cuckoo], New Zealand long-tailed cuckoo, and the peach-faced lovebird) and together they provide data for each of the six main groups of Neoaves proposed by Cracraft J (2001). We use his six main groups of modern birds as priors for evaluation of results. These include passerines, cuckoos, parrots, and three other groups termed “WoodKing” (woodpeckers/rollers/kingfishers), “SCA” (owls/potoos/owlet-nightjars/hummingbirds/swifts), and “Conglomerati. ” In general, the support is highly significant with just two exceptions, the owls move from the “SCA” group to the raptors, particularly accipitrids (buzzards/eagles) and the osprey, and the shorebirds may be an independent group {{from the rest of the}} “Conglomerati”. Molecular dating mt genomes support a major diversification of at least 12 neoavian lineages in the Late Cretaceous. Our results form a basis for further testing with both nuclear-coding sequences and rare genomic changes...|$|E
