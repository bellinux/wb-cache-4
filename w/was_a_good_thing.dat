25|$|Many White Christians in the 18th century did not {{consider}} African Americans fully human and {{did not believe that}} they had souls. When this view changed, White Christians began to try to convert slaves to Christianity, although slave owners resisted this conversion because they were afraid of slaves revolting. In trying to convert slaves to Christianity, Christian leaders reinforced and approved slavery as well as any means of punishment for slaves who revolted. Some Christian leaders even claimed that slavery <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> in that it allowed, or oftentimes forced, slaves to become Christians.|$|E
25|$|It was {{not until}} he was {{approaching}} 50 that Rameau decided to embark on the operatic career on which his fame as a composer mainly rests. He had already approached writer Houdar de la Motte for a libretto in 1727, but nothing came of it; he was finally inspired to try his hand at the prestigious genre of tragédie en musique after seeing Montéclair's Jephté in 1732. Rameau's Hippolyte et Aricie premiered at the Académie Royale de Musique on 1 October 1733. It was immediately recognised as the most significant opera to appear in France {{since the death of}} Lully, but audiences were split over whether this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> or a bad thing. Some, such as the composer André Campra, were stunned by its originality and wealth of invention; others found its harmonic innovations discordant and saw the work as an attack on the French musical tradition. The two camps, the so-called Lullyistes and the Rameauneurs, fought a pamphlet war over the issue {{for the rest of the}} decade.|$|E
25|$|At {{the later}} conventions, in Adelaide in 1897, in Sydney later {{the same year}} and in Melbourne in early 1898, there were changes to the earlier draft. In Adelaide, {{the name of the}} court was changed from Supreme Court of Australia to High Court of Australia. Many people also opposed the new court {{completely}} replacing the Privy Council: many large businesses, particularly those which were subsidiaries of British companies or regularly traded with the United Kingdom, preferred for business reasons to keep the colonies under the unified jurisdiction of the British courts, and petitioned the conventions to that effect. Other arguments posited against removing Privy Council appeals were that Australian judges were of a poorer quality than English ones, and that without the Council's oversight, the law in the colonies risked becoming different from English law. Some politicians, such as Sir George Dibbs, supported the petitioners, but others, including Alfred Deakin, supported the design of the court as it was. Inglis Clark took the view that the possibility of divergence <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing,</b> for the law could adapt appropriately to Australian circumstances. Despite the debate, the portions of the draft dealing with the court remained largely unchanged, as the delegates focused on different matters.|$|E

Noonan and Geraghty were on board the vehicle {{alongside}} their manager and a friend. Brian Crosby, Dominic Phillips, and Tim O'Donovan were inside the hotel. Fire fighters were called to the scene shortly after 3:30am and spent ninety minutes fanning the blaze, which started in the bus ventilation/air-conditioning unit and caused an estimated $50,000 (€32,000) worth of damage. Talking to local newspaper the Boston Herald, the band's manager, Foye Johnson said: [...] "The guys were basically around the bus, which <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> because {{we were able to}} get all the equipment and instruments out." [...] After a few hours of sleep, off they went in a replacement vehicle to New York City where the band played a sell-out show in the Bowery Ballroom and appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman, Other North American television appearances during the early part of 2008 included MTV Canada, The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson and Late Night with Conan O'Brien.

2500|$|In 1801, an {{antiquarian}} {{book about}} English sport noted that cricket had become [...] "exceedingly fashionable, being much countenanced by the nobility {{and gentlemen of}} fortune". In another work a year later, the fashion for cricket was deplored because it was (and remains) a dangerous activity, the writer saying that the country expects very {{different from those of}} [...] "rank and fortune" [...] than from those of [...] "the labouring classes". The determining factor in cricket's future as an [...] "exceedingly fashionable" [...] sport was its popularity, handed down through generations from old boys to new boys, in the fee-paying ("public") schools. Even so, headmasters of the time were not convinced that inter-school rivalry <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> and, when Eton played Harrow at Lord's in 1805, the match was organised by the boys themselves, among them Lord Byron.|$|E
2500|$|In 2015, Bowser's allies formed FreshPAC, a {{political}} action committee intended to advance her agenda. The initiative was the first PAC in District politics so closely aligned with a sitting mayor and created by a former campaign treasurer. Thanks to a legislative loophole regulating off-year fundraising, FreshPAC accepted unlimited contributions. Bowser supporters had quickly raised more than $300,000 and had a goal of collecting $1 million by year’s end. FreshPAC was chaired by Earle “Chico” Horton III, a lobbyist for a major corporation that sought Bowser's support. [...] Many of the highest donors participated in a trip to China with the mayor. Following outcry from the Washington Post, members of the D.C. Council, and other stakeholders, FreshPAC was shut down in November 2015. Bowser said she thought FreshPAC <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> but its message was distorted.|$|E
