40|$|Patient {{management}} following elective cranial surgery often includes routine postoperative {{computed tomography}} (CT). We analyzed whether a regime of early extubation and close neurological monitoring without routine CT is safe, and compared {{the rate of}} postoperative emergency neurosurgical intervention with published data. Four hundred ninety-two patients were prospectively analyzed; 360 had supra- and 132 had infratentorial lesions. Extubation <b>within</b> one <b>hour</b> after skin closure was aimed for in all cases. CT was performed <b>within</b> 48 <b>hours</b> only in cases of unexpected neurological findings. Four-hundred sixty-nine of the 492 patients (95. 3 %) were extubated <b>within</b> one <b>hour,</b> 20 (4. 1 %) <b>within</b> 3 <b>hours,</b> and three (0. 6 %) within 3 to 10 <b>hours.</b> Emergency CT <b>within</b> 48 <b>hours</b> was performed for 43 / 492 (8. 7 %) cases. Rate of recraniotomy <b>within</b> 48 <b>hours</b> for patients with postoperative hemorrhage was 0. 8 % (n = 4), and 0. 8 % (n = 4) required placement of an external ventricular drain (EVD). Of 469 patients extubated <b>within</b> one <b>hour,</b> 3 required recraniotomy and 2 required EVD placements. Of 23 patients with delayed extubation, 1 recraniotomy and 2 EVDs were required. Failure to extubate <b>within</b> one <b>hour</b> {{was associated with a}} significantly higher risk of surgical intervention <b>within</b> 48 <b>hours</b> (rate 13. 0 %, p = 0. 004, odds ratio 13. 9, 95 % confidence interval [3. 11 - 62. 37]). Early extubation combined with close neurological monitoring is safe and omits the need for routine postoperative CT. Patients not extubated <b>within</b> one <b>hour</b> do need early CT, since they had a significantly increased risk of requiring emergency neurosurgical intervention.

40|$|Introduction: Breastfeeding {{initiated}} <b>within</b> 1 <b>hour</b> after infant {{birth is}} important to successfully exclusive breastfeeding and infant health, especially protective infant from infection desease. In Indonesia, information determinant factors of initiated breastmilk <b>within</b> 1 <b>hour</b> after infant birth are rare. Objective: to evaluate determinant factor of initiated breastmilk <b>within</b> 1 <b>hour</b> after infant birth. Methods: Data demography health survey 2007 (DHS 2007) was analyzed using multiple regression logistic. Result: The proportion initiated of breastmilk <b>within</b> 1 <b>hour</b> after infant birth is 45. 6 % for infant 0 - 11 months age, and 45. 9 % infant 12 - 23 months age. The proportion initiated breastmilk <b>within</b> 1 <b>hour</b> after birth infant in rural area lower than infant in urban area (44. 7 % and 46. 6 %). In the urban area, parity is determinant factor of initiated of breastmilk <b>within</b> 1 <b>hour</b> after infant birth controlling sex of infant, birthweight, mother age, work status, education level, and delivery health care and pregnancy health care. In the rural area, pregnancy health care is determinant factor of initiated of breastmilk <b>within</b> 1 <b>hour</b> after infant birth controlling sex of infant, birthweight, mother age, parity, work status, education level, and delivery health care.
