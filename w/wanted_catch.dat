Narrative by Junebug Clark: This photo is most often {{associated}} with may father's poem: If You <b>Want</b> To <b>Catch</b> Fish Get your hook in the water 	If you <b>want</b> to <b>catch</b> ﬁsh You must ﬁnd a deep stream 	It’s useless to wish. Climb a high mountain 	If {{you want to see}} far There’s little sense moaning 	About what you are. Learn to see the sunshine 	If you don’t like the rain, Look for the bright side 	You’ll not look in vain. Learn to lead the crowd 	If you won’t be bossed, There’s a challenge ahead 	Streams to be crossed. Don’t sigh for the good things 	To come ﬁll your dish Get your hook in the water 	If you <b>want</b> to <b>catch</b> ﬁsh. 		hbss Photo by: Joe Clark, HBSS. Signed by: Joe Clark, HBS...|$|R
