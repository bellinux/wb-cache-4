40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} {{study the effects of}} number of nipple <b>waterers</b> (NW) per four-bird, deep cage (30. 5 x 45. 7 cm deep) or shallow cage of exact reverse dimensions and location of these <b>waterers</b> on productivity of commercial strain of White Leghorn layers reared in floor pens equipped with either dome or trigger cup <b>waterers.</b> The pullets were housed in laying cages at 18 wk of age. In both experiments, cage shape had no significant effects on the variables measured. Location of NW effects varied between experiments; hens in cages with NW located {{in the front of the}} cage had a significantly (P< 05) lower rate of lay (1. 7 %) in Experiment 2 and less mortality (5. 4 %) in Experiment 1 than those in cages with NW located in the rear. Location of NW had a NS effect on water consumption in both experiments. Number of NW per cage significantly (P< 05) affected water consumption in both experiments. Hens in cages with two NW consumed 32. 5 and 36. 7 mL/hen day more water in Experiment 1 and 2, respectively, than those in cages with one NW.

60|$|Several {{theories}} have been propounded {{to account for}} the origin of C. adami, and for the transformations which it undergoes. The whole case has been attributed by some authors to bud-variation; but considering the wide difference between C. laburnum and purpureus, both of which are natural species, and considering the sterility of the intermediate form, this view may be summarily rejected. We shall presently see that, with hybrid plants, two embryos differing in their characters may be developed within the same seed and cohere; and it has been supposed that C. adami thus originated. Many botanists maintain that C. adami is a hybrid produced in the common way by seed, and that it has reverted by buds to its two parent-forms. Negative results are not of much value; but Reisseck, Caspary, and myself, tried in vain to cross C. laburnum and purpureus; when I fertilised the former with pollen of the latter, I had the nearest approach to success, for pods were formed, but in sixteen days after the withering of the flowers, they fell off. Nevertheless, the belief that C. adami is a spontaneously produced hybrid between these two species is supported by the fact that such hybrids have arisen in this genus. In a bed of seedlings from C. elongatus, which grew near to C. purpureus, and was probably fertilised by it through the agency of insects (for these, as I know by experiment, play an important part in the fertilisation of the laburnum), the sterile hybrid C. purpureo-elongatus appeared. (11/96. Braun in 'Bot. Mem. Ray. Soc.' 1853 page 23.) Thus, also, Waterer's laburnum, the C. alpino-laburnum (11/97. This hybrid has never been described. It is exactly intermediate in foliage, time of flowering, dark striae {{at the base of the}} standard petal, hairiness of the ovarium, and in almost every other character, between C. laburnum and alpinus; but it approaches the former species more nearly in colour, and exceeds it in the length of the racemes. We have before seen that 20.3 per cent of its pollen-grains are ill-formed and worthless. My plant, though growing not above thirty or forty yards from both parent-species, during some seasons yielded no good seeds; but in 1866 it was unusually fertile, and its long racemes produced from one to occasionally even four pods. Many of the pods contained no good seeds, but generally they contained a single apparently good seed, sometimes two, and in one case three seeds. Some of these seeds germinated, and I raised two trees from them; one resembles the present form; the other has a remarkable dwarf character with small leaves, but has not yet flowered.) spontaneously appeared, as I am informed by Mr. <b>Waterer,</b> in a bed of seedlings.|$|E

40|$|During {{the summer}} and fall of 1997, the Hoop Research Complex was {{developed}} at the Iowa State University (ISU) Rhodes Research Farm for comparing hoop structures to confinement for swine finishing. The site consists of three hoop structures and one modular confinement building. The hoops, each 30 ft × 60 ft, are oriented north/south. The south end of each hoop has a concrete floor (30 ft × 15 ft). Two round feeders with 12 feeding spaces and two <b>waterers</b> with two drinking spaces are in each of the hoops.
