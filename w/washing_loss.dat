Thirteen rumen cannulated sheep in a randomized complete-block design experiment were given teff straw ad libitum supplemented (DM per day) with 155 g oilseed cake (50 : 50 mixture of noug (Guizotia abyssinica) and groundnut cake; oilseed cake diet) or with 92 g oilseed cake plus either 118 g S. sesban (sesbania diet) or 179 g A. albida fruits (albida diet). Diets were formulated to supply 10. 5 g supplementary N per day. Sesbania had the highest DM <b>washing</b> <b>loss,</b> potential degradability and fastest DM degradation rate compared with the acacias. The N <b>washing</b> <b>loss</b> (g/kg) was highest for A. siberiana (500) followed by A. albida (431), A. tortilis (431) and sesbania (241). The potential N degradability (g/kg) was greater (< 0. 05) for sesbania (978) than for A. albida (848), A. tortilis (865) or A. siberiana (785). The degradation rates of oilseed cake-N and teff straw-DM, particulate and liquid passage rates, basal intake and DM digestibilities were similar among diets, but organic matter intake was highest for the albida diet. At the present levels of offer, supplementation with mixtures of oilseed cake and browses does not significantly reduce rumen degradation rates of oilseed cake-N or teff straw DM...|$|E

Washing stage performance can be evaluated by the dilution factor, which determines the water amount used for pulp ton, and <b>washing</b> <b>loss,</b> which determines the amount of washable components in pulp discharged with pulp to bleaching that could not be washed away. This study focused on utilization of brown stock washing stage upper level control, which was based on the real time online measurement of total dry solids of the pulp suspension and washer filtrates in several points of the process. Online measurements were used to determine the chemical state of the process and adjustments to dilution factor made accordingly. Trial runs including feed consistency, washer drum torque, washing water temperature and dilution factor were made to examine the effect of different variables to washing result. A longer test period was also made to determine the upper level effect on the chlorine dioxide consumption. According to results, improvements to upper level control were made to enhance the functionality and efficiency of the washing stage. Utilization of the upper level control was successful as it became the primary way of operating the washing stage. Upper level control was found to optimize wash water usage, level out process fluctuations and thereby decrease the <b>washing</b> <b>loss</b> and chlorine dioxide consumption significantly.

40|$|In crop {{carbon budget}} studies losses of root {{material}} during storage and washing of samples may cause considerable errors. To correct data from field experiments where rhizosphere C fluxes in wheat and barley {{were determined by}} C- 14 pulse-labelling at different development stages, experiments were performed to quantify losses of C- 14 from roots during <b>washing.</b> <b>Losses</b> of C- 14 from wheat roots grown on nutrient solution and stored in different ways, decreased from on average 45 % of total C- 14 content 8 days after labelling to 27 % after 21 days. This decrease was probably related to the incorporation of C- 14 into structural compounds. During washing of oven-dried soil cores of field-grown wheat and barley 3 weeks after labelling, different size classes of losses of C- 14 from the roots increased substantially with the development stage of the crop at labelling. The 0. 3 - 0. 6 mm size class increased from 5 % of the C- 14 in roots > 0. 3 mm in young plants to 25 % at ripening, and the < 0. 3 mm size class increased from 8 to 41 % of total C- 14 content. The latter size class was, however, determined by washing handpicked roots and may therefore partly consist of adhering exudates, mucilages and microorganisms. The effect of development stage on root <b>washing</b> <b>losses</b> was attributed to root senescence which increases the fragility of roots. Thus, especially at the late development stages root <b>washing</b> <b>losses</b> caused a severe underestimation of the root C- 14 content.

The effects of different co-catalysts as well as reaction parameters including catalyst loadings, CO 2 pressure, reaction temperature, and reaction time on the coupling reaction of CO 2 to propylene oxide were thoroughly investigated. With the molar ratio of guanidine hydrochloride to ZnI 2 at 5 : 1, excellent yield (94 %) and selectivity (≥ 99 %) of propylene carbonate were obtained under 100 °C and at 1 MPa for 1. 5 h. Additionally, ZnI 2 could be recycled, but because of the <b>washing</b> <b>loss</b> of guanidine hydrochloride, there was a slight decrease in the yield of propylene carbonate. Gratifyingly, the activity of the catalytic system could be restored by adding additional 20 mol% of fresh guanidine hydrochloride, thus exhibiting excellent recyclability of the ZnI 2 catalyst. Moreover, the binary catalysts were also versatile when using other epoxides for CO 2 cycloaddition. A possible reaction mechanism was proposed wherein guanidine hydrochloride plays a dual role in activating CO 2 and epoxide, and ZnI 2 activated epoxide, simultaneously.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of fruits maturity stages at harvest on chemical composition, in vitro digestibility and in sacco degradability of Ficus surfruits (FSF). The treatments involved different maturity stages of Ficus sur fruits. Color, moisture content, and texture were used to distinguish among the fruit maturity stages. Fruits at early, mid, and late stages of maturity were collected from five trees and analyzed. The proximate composition of the fruits varied only slightly (0 to 3 %) with the progress in maturity of the fruits. The exception was the DM content which increased from 45 to 87 % with increasing maturity. The condensed tannins were low (< 2 %) for all the stages of maturity. In vitro and in sacco measurements indicated that the fruits at all stages of maturity were theoretically only slightly inferior to cereal grains as sources of digestible energy. However, the high <b>washing</b> <b>loss</b> in the in sacco study (38 to 42 %) indicates that much of the digestible carbohydrate was in the form of soluble sugars which, depending on the levels used in the diet, could compromise the realizable net energy value of the diet.

40|$|Abstract Washing during kraft pulping can {{be divided}} into two {{separate}} areas each with its own distinct features: namely brownstock washing and washing in bleaching. Research interest has so far concentrated mostly on investigating brownstock washing and factors affecting its efficiency. Pulp washing in bleaching, however, has been practically neglected. The basic phenomena are the same as in brownstock washing, but there are differences which have not been taken into consideration to a sufficient extent. This less explored area is the focus of this research. In this thesis, it is shown that brownstock washing and pulp washing between bleaching stages are distinct areas with their own specific features. They differ for example in terms of the composition and molecular size of the impurities in the pulp suspension. Various process conditions, pH, temperature and so on cause further differences between washing in bleaching and brownstock washing. The removal of specific compounds can be clearly affected by the appropriate selection of wash liquor. It is shown that the dynamic behaviour during washing is different for different compounds and depends on the properties of the wash water. The key element is to find the most harmful compounds in specific positions in bleaching and on the basis of that finding, to determine the most suitable wash liquor system. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) is a widely used method for evaluating the washing result, but as a collective measurement variable it does not describe the actual compounds that cause the "loss" of bleaching chemicals. Studies have shown that many compounds contribute to COD load but ultimately most of them have no real effect on the bleaching result. A suggestion for more precise definition of <b>wash</b> <b>loss</b> is offered than COD...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} on the flow of aqueous solutions of detergent through mesh screens to mimic cloth <b>washing.</b> Pressure <b>losses</b> across the mesh screens were measured for water, dilute polymer and several aqueous detergent solutions. A reduction of pressure losses was observed for the flow of aqueous solutions of low molecular weight surfactants such as Laurylether (AE), Laurylbenzene-sulfonic acid-sodiumsalt (LAS), Benzalkonium-chloride (BC) Sodium-dodecyl-sulfate (SDS), and Hexadecyltrimetyl-ammonium-bromide (CTAB), but not for the high molecular weight polymers like Polyethylene-oxide (PEO 18) and Polyacrylamide (PAA), through mesh screens. A flow visualization experiment was carried out to observe the flow pattern upstream and downstream of the mesh screen. Photographic images revealed that, instead of an expected large converging flow from the upstream section into the screen opening as in orifice flow, the bulk of the liquid entering the screen aperture took the form of a liquid column of similar diameter as the inlet tube. Based on this observation, a flow model, which led to a new set of definitions of Reynolds number and drag coefficient, was proposed. Good correlations of drag coefficient and Reynolds number were obtained for all test solutions, and the drag reduction phenomenon was manifested for detergent aqueous solutions...|$|R

The experiment using Menke in vitro gas production was conducted to determine the dry matter digestibility of tropical tree legumes; Leucaena leucocephala, Flemingia macrophyla, and Gliricida sepium. The samples were collected from Institute of Animal Science farms of the University of the Philippines at Los Banos. The amount of gas produced were recorded at 3, 6, 12, 48 and 72 hours of incubation. To estimate the volume of gas, the equation of Tuah was adopted; while to describe the course of gas production, the equation of MCDONALD was used. The <b>washing</b> <b>loss</b> was not measured and assumed to be zero. Results showed that leucaena at 12 hours was the highest in the volume of gas produced (1. 217 ml/g DM). There was a similarity of highly increase of the gas produced between gliricidia and flemingia at 24 hours of incubation i. e 1. 60 ml/g DM and 1. 60 ml/g DM. The potential extent gas production at 72 hours (b value) and the gas production rate (c value) of three legumes were no significantly different. According to the logarithmic-curve of gas volume produced, leucaena tended to be the highest of increase in potential extent and the gas production rate. The different rate of gas production in related to incubation reflected the dry matter digestibility of the three legumes in the rumen. ...|$|E

Thirty six Sudan Baggara bulls were used. They were of an average initial weight of 202 Kg. Animals were randomly divided into four treatment groups of nine animals each. Each group was further subdivided into three subgroups of three animals. The four groups were employed in a feeding trail for an average of 63 days. Following an adaptation period of three weeks, each group was fed one of the four experimental diets during which feedlot performance was monitored. The data of feed intake were collected daily and that of live weight was done at weekly interval. The bulls were fattened to a target slaughter weight (260 Kg) where thirty six bulls were slaughtered (9 bulls from each group). Carcass data were collected and meat chemical analysis was carried out. The total dry matter intake was not significantly (P> 0. 05) different between the four treatment groups (Sorghum straw + molasses concentrated diet). Also the average dry matter intake was not significantly (P> 0. 05) different between the four treatment groups. The result obtained showed no significant (P> 0. 05) differences in the average daily gain (0. 96 for group A, 1. 02 for group B, 0. 84 for group C and 0. 91 for group D) among the treatment groups. Feed conversion ratio (FCR) was not significantly different between the four treatment groups (10. 40 for group A, 9. 63 for group B, 11. 69 for group C and 10. 84 for group D) A degradability trial of the diets was carried out using two fistulae bulls. Followed by a digestibility study which was conducted to evaluated the diets using three rams, each ram was placed in a metabolic unit for 17 days, the first three days of the treatment period was change over period. Sorghum straw showed the mean (48. 23 %) of degradable dry matter and initial <b>washing</b> <b>loss</b> (at zero time). Digestibility of (D. M) and (CP) of Sorghum straw were 62. 065 and 91. 980 respectively. Molasses concentrated diet potential degradability of (D. M) and (CP) were 89. 60 and 87. 30 respectively. Digestibility of (D. M) and (CP) of molasses concentrated diet were 76. 19 and 92. 84 respectively. The result indicated that non-carcass component showed no significant (P> 0. 05) differences between the four treatment groups.

Deltamethrin treated nets in WHO test kits in susceptibility test 1 showed remarkable efficacy (89. 5 %) 1 h after the treatment and efficacy was 100 % {{at the end of}} 24 h. The results demonstrated significant differences in mortality between different time intervals. Average mortality started to increase just after 15 min; it was 61 % after 30 min, reaching 82 % after 45 min and peaked to mass mortality rate at the end of 24 h. Efficacy against An. superpictus ranged from 90 % to 100 %, depending on different exposure periods in susceptibility test 2. The increase in mortality rates was exponential until 45 min exposure.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a comparison between}} two different techniques for the determination of the effect of soiling on large scale photovoltaic plants. Four Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) models have been developed in order to calculate the performance at Standard Test Conditions (STC) of two plants installed in Southern Italy before and after a complete clean-up of their modules. The differences between the STC power before and after the clean-up represent the losses due to the soiling effect. The results obtained with the BNN models are compared with the ones calculated with a well known regression model. Although the soiling effect can {{have a significant impact on}} the PV system performance and specific models developed are applicable only to the specific location in which the testing was conducted, this study is of great importance because it suggests a procedure to be used in order to give the necessary confidence to operation and maintenance personnel in applying the right schedule of clean-ups by making the right compromise between <b>washing</b> cost and <b>losses</b> in energy production...|$|R
50|$|Gales were {{reported}} from Savannah, Georgia, to Wilmington, North Carolina. Near Halifax, North Carolina, the winds toppled a railroad bridge about 450 ft (140 m) long and 60 ft (20 m) high. The storm also ravaged farmland in the area, destroying crops, fences, trees, and structures, and injuring several people. Much damage {{was reported in}} the Raleigh area, and many trees in New Bern suffered at least some limb breakage; several large trees were fully uprooted. The local corn crop—already diminished from the July hurricane—was judged completely lost, though property damage was negligible.

40|$|Agricultural {{expansion}} in the Mediterranean resulted in plant and soil degradation due to the intensive use, climate conditions, and rugged terrain. After abandonment, the recovery of vegetation contributed to improvement in soil quality from a hydrological, pedological and geomorphological point of view. This paper shows three examples of ecosystem evolution in abandoned fields in Valencia, Murcia and Andalucia {{and the application of}} different methodological approaches that resulted in similar findings. In Valencia, the main responses were the recovery of vegetation after land abandonment and an increase in organic matter and infiltration capacity of soils. In Murcia, with the exception of some terraced areas on marls, where erosion processes following abandonment were important, land abandonment resulted in vegetation recovery, improved soil properties, and reduced surface <b>wash</b> and soil <b>losses.</b> In Andalucia, research along climatological gradients showed the relationship between vegetation patterns and soil moisture and the control that climate exerts on hydrological and erosive behaviour. The experimental research conducted in three different regions in Western Mediterranean demonstrated that abandonment can result in recovery of the geo-ecosystem as vegetation and soil quality improvements were shown. The marls areas in Murcia were the exception with low soil quality and low vegetation cover, and as a consequence showed evidence of high erosion rates after abandonment. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} the {{dissertation}} was on {{the evaluation of the}} effect of fertilisation on the elution of nutrients from the soil in various soil and climate conditions. The results were used of long-term stationary experiments conducted at the ÚKZUZ (Institute for Supervising and Testing in Agriculture) by means of lysimeter measurements and monitoring of meteorological data taking into account the respective production region. The trial plots are located {{in various parts of the}} Czech Republic therefore we can compare the results of experiments according to the soil-leaching regimes, various degree of fertilisation on arable land etc. Three crop rotations were evaluated (1989 - 1996, 1997 - 2004, 2005 - 2012). The most severe <b>losses</b> caused by <b>washing</b> out were <b>losses</b> of calcium, sulphates and nitrate N. In the case of N and K the balance of nutrients (uptake [...] outflow) was in most cases negative with the exception of potato growing. This negative balance is based on the higher outflow (withdrawal by yields + washing-out losses) as compared to the lower input (nutrient uptake from fertilisers + precipitation). The balance was more negative in the BVO (potato growing region) with a soil-leaching phase than in the ŘVO (sugar-beet growing region) where the soil-leaching regime was periodic. Adequate and harmonic fertilisation is the prerequisite for a balance of nutrients respecting the actual yields...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} pyrazolotriazolopyrimidines was {{previously}} {{reported to be}} highly potent and selective human A(3) adenosine receptor antagonists (Baraldi et al. J. Med. Chem. 2000, 43, 4768 - 4780). A derivative having a methyl group at the N(8) pyrazole combined with a 4 -methoxyphenylcarbamoyl moiety at N(5) position, displayed a K(i) value at the hA(3) receptor of 0. 2 nM. We now describe chemically reactive derivatives which act as irreversible inhibitors of this receptor. Electrophilic groups, specifically sulfonyl fluoride and nitrogen mustard (bis-(beta-chloroethyl) amino) moieties, have been incorporated at the 4 -position of the aryl urea group. Membranes containing the recombinant hA(3) receptor were preincubated with the compounds and <b>washed</b> exhaustively. The <b>loss</b> of ability to bind radioligand following this treatment indicated irreversible binding. The most potent compound in irreversibly binding to the receptor was 14, which contained a sulfonyl fluoride moiety and a propyl group at the N(8) pyrazole nitrogen. The bis-(beta-chloroethyl) amino derivatives displayed a much smaller degree of irreversible binding than the sulfonyl fluoride derivatives. A computer-generated model of the human A(3) receptor was built and analyzed to help interpret these results. The model of the A(3) transmembrane region was derived using primary sequence comparison, secondary structure predictions, and three-dimensional homology building, using the recently published crystal structure of rhodopsin as a template. According to our model, sulfonyl fluoride derivatives could dock within the hypothetical TM binding domain, adopting two different energetically favorable conformations. We have identified two amino acids, Ser 247 and Cys 251, both in TM 6, as potential nucleophilic partners of the irreversible binding to the receptor...|$|R
5000|$|Although only a {{tropical}} storm at landfall, torrential rains associated with Vera triggered widespread flooding throughout eastern China. Damage from the storm was regarded as the worst in 27 years. Large parts of Zhejiang Province were inundated by the storm, including {{the port city of}} Shujiang. Early reports indicated that at least 190 people were injured near Shanghai. Two days after the storm, only scarce reports on the scale of damage were available. On September 18, officials announced over national television that at least 72 people were killed and hundreds were missing. By then, workers began repairing damaged coastlines and building up stone sea walls. According to the nation's flood control officials, approximately 347,000 hectares (857,000 acres) of farmland and 16,000 hectares (40,000 acres) of crops were flooded by the storm. At least 162 people were killed and another 354 were listed as missing. Additionally, 692 people were injured by the storm. Immense structural losses took place throughout the province with 3.1 million homes damaged or destroyed. Additionally, 430 km of coastal dykes and 174 km of irrigation ditches were <b>washed</b> away. Total <b>losses</b> throughout Zhejiang Province reached $351 million. Significant losses also took place in nearby Jiangsu Province where 34 people were killed and an estimated 2,000 more were injured. Approximately 590,000 hectares (1.5 million acres) of farmland was inundated by the storm and total losses reached $485,000. Throughout eastern China, approximately 5.86 million households (23 million people) were affected by flooding triggered by the storm.

40|$|Due to its ease of obtaining, handling, {{price and}} {{biological}} value, the egg {{is one of}} the most consumed foods in the world. However, because it is basically for in natura use, offers risks when care is not observed on its handling, storage and shelf life. The objective of this research was to increase the shelf life of hens eggs (Gallus domesticus) using the bee propolis (Apis mellifera). Eggs were covered with a film of propolis and these eggs were compared with uncovered ones: unwashed and <b>washed</b> eggs. Weight <b>loss,</b> density, Haugh unit, height of the air chamber and survey of total coliform, coliform and Salmonella were evaluated. The coverage with propolis provided less weight loss, lower reduction of density and loss of the Haugh unit. The process also allow to kept the size of the air chamber. No coliforms or Salmonella were found in eggs coated with propolis. Thus, it was observed that the coverage of eggs with propolis increases the shelf life and maintains internal and microbiological qualities of the eggs. Devido a sua facilidade de obtenção, manejo, preço e valor biológico, o ovo é um dos alimentos mais consumidos no mundo. No entanto, por ser basicamente utilizado in natura, oferece risco quando alguns cuidados não são observados em seu manuseio, armazenamento e prazo de validade. O objetivo deste trabalho foi estender o período de validade dos ovos através do uso de própolis de abelhas (Apis mellifera). Os ovos foram cobertos com uma película de própolis e comparados com ovos não lavados e lavados. Foram avaliadas a perda de massa, massa específica, unidade Haugh, altura da câmara de ar e a presença de bactérias dos grupos coliformes totais, termotolerantes e do gênero Salmonella. A cobertura com própolis promoveu menor perda de massa, menor redução da massa específica, menor perda da unidade Haugh com manutenção do tamanho da câmara de ar. Coliformes ou bactérias do gênero Salmonella não foram encontrados em ovos revestidos com própolis. Assim, observou-se que a cobertura de ovos com própolis mantém as qualidades internas e microbiológicas por mais tempo, aumentando a vida de prateleira dos mesmos...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this work}} are to characterise the in vitro fermentation contribution of both soluble and insoluble fractions, {{and the effects of}} ensiling of acacia (Acacia saligna, AC) and leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala, LE) leaves with different levels of urea (U, 0, 1, 3 or 5 %) on gas production, energy value and organic matter digestibility (OMD%) of AC and LE. The acacia and leucaena were ensiled for 35 days. Ground samples (200 mg DM) of the ensiled materials from the eight treatments were incubated in glass syringes with rumen fluid obtained from fistulated sheep fed berseem hay and commercial concentrate mixture twice a day. Cumulative gas production was recorded at 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h of incubation and the kinetics of gas production was described by using the equation: Gas (Y) = a + b (1 -exp-ct). Ensiling of AC and LE leaves with U increased crude protein and ash, while the contents of tested samples of total phenol (TP), total tannins (TT) and condensed tannins (CT) were decreased. Also, ensiling of AC and LE leaves with U significantly (P < 0. 05) decreased gas production. All <b>washed</b> samples showed <b>losses</b> of soluble material. The gas production was, in general, significantly (P< 0. 05) higher for the unwashed substrates. Leucaena gave the highest values of gas production compared with acacia. The gas production volume was significantly (P < 0. 05) higher for ensiled AC and LE leaves without U than ensiled AC with 5 %U or ensiled LE with 3 %U. The maximum rate of gas production increased after ensiling AC and LE leaves with 5 % and 3 % U, respectively. The calculated values of metabolizable energy (ME) and net energy (NE) were significantly (P< 0. 05) increased for ensiled AC with 3 and 5 %U, while ensiled LE with U was not significantly affected. The organic matter digestibility (OMD %) and microbial protein production were significantly (P< 0. 05) higher for ensiled AC and LE with U, while short chain fatty acids (SCFA) were significantly (P< 0. 05) decreased. The concentrations of TP, TT and CT were strongly correlated (p< 0. 01). The TP, TT and CT were negatively related (p< 0. 01) with neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF), but not with hemicelluloses (HEMI). The crude protein was strongly correlated (p< 0. 01) with NDF, ADF and CT and negatively related (p< 0. 01) with TF and TT, but not with HEMI. In conclusion, there were negative effects on the in vitro gas production occurring more consistently when AC and LE were ensiled with different levels of U, while OMD% and microbial proteins were significantly (P< 0. 05) increased. The in vitro digestibility and gas production parameters were significantly correlated with chemical composition of shrubs. Finally, it is generally more appropriate to measure the degradation of organic matter as usual dry matter can give problems of interpretation of the significance of the soluble fraction...|$|R
