5|$|Besides the Mahavidya Bagalamukhi, Matangi is {{the other}} Mahavidya, whose worship is {{primarily}} prescribed to acquire supernatural powers. A hymn in the Maha-bhagavata Purana asks her grace to control one's foes, while the Tantrasara says that recitation of her mantra, meditation on her form and her ritual worship gives one to the power to control people and make them attracted to oneself. Her devotees, especially Tantric sadhakas, are regarded to have transcend the pollution by offering her left-over or partially eaten food (Ucchishta) and thus overcome their ego. Worship of Matangi is described to allow her devotee to face the forbidden and transcend pollution, leading him to salvation or allowing him to gain supernatural powers for worldly goals. The Purashcharyarnava describes pleasing the goddess would result in her answering all the devotee's queries by <b>whispering</b> <b>in</b> her ear.|$|E
25|$|Prisoners, rangers and {{visitors}} have reported {{a wide range}} of alleged ghostly activity on Alcatraz, from <b>whispering</b> <b>in</b> cells and locked cell doors shutting, to phantom figures in corridors, cold spots and even the sounds of musical instruments and sewing machines. Officials for Alcatraz have dismissed the reports of ghosts at Alcatraz as nonsense and deny their existence.|$|E
25|$|This {{scene is}} shown as {{a version of}} the {{traditional}} Evangelist portrait (where the Evangelists' symbols are also sometimes shown dictating) from the tenth century onwards. An early example is the dedication miniature from an eleventh-century manuscript of Saint Gregory's Moralia in Job. The miniature shows the scribe, Bebo of Seeon Abbey, presenting the manuscript to the Holy Roman Emperor, Henry II. In the upper left the author is seen writing the text under divine inspiration. Usually the dove is shown <b>whispering</b> <b>in</b> Gregory's ear for a clearer composition.|$|E

25|$|The Preaching of the Antichrist {{was painted}} {{shortly after the}} {{execution}} of Savonarola in Florence on 23 May 1498. This friar had been judged guilty of heresy, and the Antichrist, preaching slander and calumny, is causing an uproar such as Savonarola did. The Antichrist is depicted resembling Christ, but is embraced by the Devil <b>whispering</b> <b>in</b> his ear. Among the crowd listening to the Antichrist Signorelli has painted some remarkable figures: a young Raphael in a striking pose, Dante, possibly Christopher Columbus, Boccaccio, Petrarch and Cesare Borgia. Remarkably, in the left corner of the fresco, he has painted himself, dressed in noble garments, and Fra Angelico in habit. In the left background the Antichrist is being chased from heavens by the archangel Michael, and his acolytes being killed by a rain of fire. In the right background he depicts a large Classical temple topped by a dome in Renaissance style. More likely is that the scenes reflect scripture readings {{called for in the}} liturgies for the Feast of All Saints and the four Sundays of Advent.|$|E
500|$|Journalist Alissa Stickler {{describes}} Flagg as a [...] "contemporary medievalist interpretation on {{the themes}} of evil, magic and the (d)evil figure". She likens Flagg to Merlin, <b>whispering</b> <b>in</b> the ear of Arthur. Stickler notes that Flagg is politically powerful in The Stand and The Eyes of the Dragon; he uses his power differently in each novel, challenging depictions of evil and witchcraft common in medieval times. She explains that there {{does not appear to}} be a higher power to which Flagg [...] "must appeal to his abilities" [...] as there is with traditional evil. Flagg is more of a [...] "humanesque evil", which works against him as much as it does for him. His supernatural knowledge is fallible, and the customary black-and-white depiction is replaced with an [...] "acceptance of a shadowy gray area". Stickler says that although Flagg appears [...] "terrifying and supernatural" [...] as depicted by King, there are no absolutes. She concludes that Flagg represents the medieval monster both past and future, which challenges and yet supports the literary Middle Ages.|$|E
500|$|On {{the evening}} of 21 July 2013 – when Jones was 16 – he dressed in female {{clothing}} and attended a dance party with Keke and Khloe called Henessey Sundays, held at a bar in the Irwin area. They arrived by taxi at around 2am. Jones passed as a girl at the party, and several males danced with him. Although he initially kept his biological sex a secret from others at the party, fearing homophobic persecution, he revealed his identity to a girl {{with whom he had}} previously been to church. The girl informed her male friends, who accosted him outside the venue, demanding to know, [...] "Are you a woman or a man?" [...] One of the men used a lantern to examine Jones' feet, claiming that they were too large to be those of a biological woman. Discovering his sex, they started calling him [...] "batty boy" [...] and other homophobic epithets. Khloe {{tried to get him to}} avoid confrontation, <b>whispering</b> <b>in</b> his ear, [...] "Walk with me, walk with me", but Jones refused, instead insisting to those assembled that he was female.|$|E

500|$|On 13 July 1942, the Franks {{were joined}} by the van Pels family: Hermann, Auguste, and 16-year-old Peter, and then in November by Fritz Pfeffer, a dentist and friend of the family. Frank wrote of her {{pleasure}} at having new people to talk to, but tensions quickly developed within the group forced to live in such confined conditions. After sharing her room with Pfeffer, she {{found him to be}} insufferable and resented his intrusion, and she clashed with Auguste van Pels, whom she regarded as foolish. She regarded Hermann van Pels and Fritz Pfeffer as selfish, particularly in regard to the amount of food they consumed. Some time later, after first dismissing the shy and awkward Peter van Pels, she recognized a kinship with him and the two entered a romance. She received her first kiss from him, but her infatuation with him began to wane as she questioned whether her feelings for him were genuine, or resulted from their shared confinement. Anne Frank formed a close bond with each of the helpers, and Otto Frank later recalled that she had anticipated their daily visits with impatient enthusiasm. He observed that Anne's closest friendship was with Bep Voskuijl, [...] "the young typist... the two of them often stood <b>whispering</b> <b>in</b> the corner." ...|$|E
500|$|Vocalist David Draiman states that, lyrically, {{the album}} was {{inspired}} by various occurrences of bad luck that happened to him. [...] "I had a motorcycle accident, and I had my garage burn down with most of my vehicles," [...] Draiman commented. [...] "...I've had really bad relationships that I've {{been in and out}} of. They've left their mark", he concluded. The song [...] "Indestructible" [...] is [...] "an anthem for soldiers", Draiman comments. [...] "It's meant to be something that would make them feel invincible, take away their fear, make them strong and that's what this whole body of work on this record does. It's music to help you feel strong," [...] he concludes. Cuts such as [...] "Deceiver" [...] and [...] "Inside the Fire" [...] are about [...] "really bad relationships". [...] "Inside the Fire" [...] is about [...] "standing over the body of my girlfriend, who just killed herself, and the Devil is standing over me, <b>whispering</b> <b>in</b> my ear to kill myself," [...] says Draiman. The song [...] "The Night" [...] is, [...] "just kind of meant to portray the night almost as like a living entity that sets you free. You're enveloped by it, enmasked by it," [...] Draiman comments. The band's vocalist also says the song [...] "Perfect Insanity" [...] is about [...] "toying with the idea of insanity. Coming at you from the perspective from the individual who is [...] and warning people around him, particularly his love interests, about his psychotic tendencies." [...] Draiman says the track [...] "Divide" [...] "is meant to detract from the idea 'oh, let's all be one, let's all be united!' Fuck that, be yourself, be an individual, stand out, make your mark, make an impact." [...] Commenting on the meaning of the song [...] "Façade", Draiman says it is, [...] "...a song {{from the perspective of a}} girl in a relationship where she's abused... she's thinking about killing him, like you see on the news." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Gospel book as {{a medium}} for heavily {{illustrated}} manuscripts declined in the West from the Romanesque period, {{and with it the}} use of the Evangelist portrait. In the Eastern Orthodox world, the Gospel Book remained a primary focus for illumination, and Evangelist portraits, derived from contemporary Byzantine versions, are heavily represented among the earliest illuminations from the new Slav national traditions, such as the 11th-century Ostromir Gospels and the Khitrovo Gospels of about 1390 from Muscovy. [...] In the West the portraits continued to be found in Bibles, more often as the picture within a historiated initial at the start of each Gospel. [...] Other books sometimes contained them as well. [...] Similar compositions began to be used for other saint-authors, especially for St Jerome, who is often shown in a book-lined study, often with his symbol, a lion, dozing at his feet. Similarly St Gregory the Great may be shown with a dove, representing his inspiration from the Holy Spirit, <b>whispering</b> <b>in</b> his ear.|$|E
2500|$|Hung {{entered her}} first Legislative Election {{campaign}} in 1989. Her KMT branch director objected to her request, and therefore {{did not give}} her time off during the campaign. Hung insisted on entering the primary and was only {{able to participate in}} the events on weekends as a candidate. She had her cousin go to the events on weekdays and hold up her poster whenever her name was called as a silent protest of her helpless absence. This was widely reported by the media and Hung won the primary by marginal votes, and thus was nominated by the party. Hung said, [...] "My father passed away the moment when I won the primary. It seemed that he was waiting for the final confirmation. I was <b>whispering</b> <b>in</b> his ear, 'Bless me with the nomination {{if you want me to}} embark on my career in this path of politics.'" [...] Hung subsequently won the seat in the legislative election and began her career in the Legislative Yuan for eight consecutive terms.|$|E
2500|$|Even {{in old age}} Sir Laurens van der Post was {{involved}} with many projects, from the worldwide conservationist movement, to setting up a centre of Jungian studies in Cape Town. He remained a captivating speaker and storyteller both in public and in private. A Walk with a White Bushman (1986), the transcript {{of a series of}} interviews, gives a taste of his appeal as a conversationalist. In 1996 he tried to prevent the eviction of the Bushmen from their homeland in the Central Kalahari Game Reserve, which had been set up for that purpose, but ironically it was his work in the 1950s to promote the land for cattle ranching that led to their eventual removal. In October 1996 he published The Admiral's Baby, describing the events in Java {{at the end of the}} war. For his 90th birthday party he had a five-day celebration in Colorado, with a [...] "this is your life" [...] type event with friends from every period of his life. A few days later, on 16 December 1996, after <b>whispering</b> <b>in</b> Afrikaans [...] "die sterre" [...] (the stars), he died. The funeral took place 20 December in London, attended by Zulu chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Prince Charles, Margaret Thatcher, and many friends and family. His ashes were buried in a special memorial garden at Philippolis on 4 April 1998. Ingaret died five months after him on 5 May 1997.|$|E
