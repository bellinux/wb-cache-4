The review identified a significant amount of descriptive literature, but only one cohort study and no trials or previous systematic reviews of literatures.

40|$|In {{the mountainous}} areas of Europe with a humid climate, dairy cattle {{production}} {{is a major}} agricultural activity, and the milk is often processed into cheese according to {{protected designation of origin}} (PDO) specifications. We analyzed the extent to which PDO specifications and/or a mountain environment influence the spatial distribution of estimated breeding values (EBVs) of cows and the herd–year effects (HYEs) for milk yield (kg/lactation) and protein and fat contents (g/kg), as well as lactation ranks and calving months. The study focused on the northern French Alps. A total of 37 023 lactations, recorded in 2006, in 1153 herds were analyzed. The cows belonged to the Montbéliarde (21 516 lactations), Abondance (10 346 lactations) and Tarentaise (5161 lactations) breeds. The two factors of variation considered were the status of the commune where the farm was located in relation to PDO (three categories: area <b>with</b> no <b>PDO,</b> area <b>with</b> a <b>PDO</b> <b>with</b> no milk yield limit, area <b>with</b> a <b>PDO</b> <b>with</b> a milk yield limit) and ‘mountain’ environment (four categories based on the European regulation: plain, piedmont, mountain and high mountain). In the Abondance breed, the average lactation rank increased with an increase in production constraints due to the PDO or to a mountain environment. In the Abondance and Tarentaise breeds, grouping of calving in winter was most marked in the ‘PDO with a milk yield limit’ and ‘high-mountain’ categories. In the Tarentaise breed, no significant effect on any trait and any variable was found in the ‘PDO’ or ‘mountain’ categories. In the other two breeds, the average EBV for milk yield decreased with an increase in the constraints due to <b>PDO,</b> <b>with</b> differences of 226 and 93 kg between extreme values in the Abondance and Montbéliarde breeds, respectively. The average HYE for milk yield was higher in the Abondance breed in the ‘PDO with no milk yield limit’ category than in the other categories (+ 740 and + 1110 kg, respectively); HYE was not affected by the ‘PDO’ factor in the Montbéliarde breed or by the ‘mountain’ factor in either breed. Concerning the protein and fat contents, the effect of the ‘PDO’ and ‘mountain’ factors depended on the trait, the variable and the breed.

40|$|The {{effects of}} natural variability, {{especially}} El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) effects, {{have been the}} focus of several recent studies on the change of drought patterns with climate change. The interannual relationship between ENSO and the global climate is not stationary and can be modulated by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). However, the global land distribution of the dry-wet changes associated with the combination of ENSO and the PDO remains unclear. In the present study, this is investigated using a revised Palmer Drought Severity Index dataset (sc_PDSI_pm). We find that the effect of ENSO on dry-wet changes varies <b>with</b> the <b>PDO</b> phase. When in phase <b>with</b> the <b>PDO,</b> ENSO-induced dry-wet changes are magnified with respect to the canonical pattern. When out of phase, these dry-wet variations weaken or even disappear. This remarkable contrast in ENSO's influence between the two phases of the PDO highlights exciting new avenues for obtaining improved global climate predictions. In recent decades, the PDO has turned negative with more La Nina events, implying more rain and flooding over land. La Nina-induced wet areas become wetter and the dry areas become drier and smaller due to the effects of the cold PDO phase.

Identify natural climate extreme {{variability}} {{is very important to}} understand the interaction between this kind of variability and the anthropogenically-forced. This paper investigate temporal variability of extreme temperature indexes from a daily database of maximum and minimum temperature from five meteorological stations in Uruguay, Southeastern South America. The indexes are percentile-based from the 1961 - 1990 base period; we use Tx 90 (warm days), Tx 10 (cold days), Tn 90 (warm nights) and Tn 10 (cold nights). We analyzed the annual, summer (DJF) and winter (JJA) series of each index. The Tx 90, Tx 10 and Tn 10 indexes had significant negative trends, while Tn 90 have significant positive trend. A marked minimum in almost all detrended indexes were detected around {{the second part of the}} 1970 s, which is presumably related to the well known climatic jump of 1976 / 77. The spectral analysis was performed using the Multitaper Methods. The detrended annual series, showed significant interannual oscillation with periods of 3 to 5 years and in some index and for the longest series a significant oscillation of 7 to 10 years were also found. To better identify temporal variability in decadal to multidecadal scales, the series were smoothed in time by 10 -year running mean. A significant oscillation at 99 % level were found in all indexes and for all the station with period of 15 to 25 years. The interannual variability was also significant for the smoothed series. Relationship between temperature indexes and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO, were studied for the smoothed annual, summer (DEF) and winter (JJA) seasonal series. The most relevant result, showed a significant negative correlation <b>with</b> <b>PDO</b> phases. A positive (negative) PDO index is correlated with cold (warm) winters and warm (cold) summers. Two of the stations analyzed have an out of phase behavior of the Tn 10 and Tx 90 10 -yr running mean indexes. One of them, Rocha, is located in the eastern side of Uruguay, over the coast of the Atlantic Ocean, while the other, Paysandú, is in the western side over the Uruguay river.

40|$|Snowpack, as {{measured}} on 1 April, {{is the primary}} source of warm-season streamflow for most of the western United States and thus represents an important source of water supply. An understanding of climate factors that influence the variability of this water supply and thus its predictability is important for water resource man-agement. In this study, principal component analysis is used to identify the primary modes of 1 April snowpack variability in the western United States. Two components account for 61 % of the total snowpack variability in the western United States. Relations between these modes of variability and indices of Pacific Ocean climate [e. g., the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) and Niño- 3 sea surface temperatures (SSTs) ] are examined. The first mode of snowpack variability is closely associated <b>with</b> the <b>PDO,</b> whereas the second mode varies in concert <b>with</b> both the <b>PDO</b> and Niño- 3 SSTs. Because these atmospheric–oceanic conditions change slowly from season to season, the observed teleconnections between the Pacific Ocean climate and 1 April snowpack may be useful to forecast 1 April snowpack using data that describe the Pacific Ocean climate in the previous summer and autumn seasons, especially for the northwestern United States. 1...|$|R
40|$|Understanding how {{internal}} climate variability influences arctic regions {{is required}} to better forecast future global climate variations. This paper investigates an annually-laminated (varved) record from the western Canadian Arctic and finds that the varves are negatively corre- lated with both the instrumental Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) during the past century and also <b>with</b> reconstructed <b>PDO</b> over the past 700 years, suggesting drier Arctic con- ditions during high-PDO phases, and vice versa. These results are in agreement with known regional teleconnections, whereby the PDO is negatively and positively correlated with summer precipitation and mean sea level pressure respec- tively. This pattern is also evident during the positive phase of the North Pacific Index (NPI) in autumn. Reduced sea-ice cover during summer-autumn is observed in the region during PDO (NPI+) and is associated with low-level southerly winds that originate from the northernmost Pacific across the Bering Strait and can reach {{as far as the}} western Cana- dian Arctic. These climate anomalies are associated <b>with</b> the <b>PDO</b> (NPI+) phase and are key factors in enhancing evaporation and subsequent precipitation in this region of the Arctic. Collectively, the sedimentary evidence suggests that North Pacific climate variability has been a persistent regulator of the regional climate in the western Canadian Arctic.
