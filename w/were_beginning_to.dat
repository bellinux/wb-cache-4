5|$|After {{the rise}} of philosophy, history, prose and rationalism in the late 5th century BC, the fate of myth became uncertain, and mythological genealogies gave place to a {{conception}} of history which tried to exclude the supernatural (such as the Thucydidean history). While poets and dramatists were reworking the myths, Greek historians and philosophers <b>were</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> criticize them.|$|E
5|$|Although Sicily was lost, {{the general}} Nikephoros Phokas the Elder succeeded in taking Taranto {{and much of}} Calabria in 880, forming the nucleus for the later Catepanate of Italy. The successes in the Italian Peninsula opened a new period of Byzantine {{domination}} there. Above all, the Byzantines <b>were</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> establish a strong presence in the Mediterranean Sea, and especially the Adriatic.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time that the U.S. forces were mobilizing, Shōji and his troops <b>were</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> reach Koli Point east of the Metapona River at Gavaga Creek. Late in the day, 31 CAF {{aircraft}} attacked Shōji's forces, inflicting about 100 deaths and injuries on the Japanese. Some of the CAF aircraft also mistakenly attacked Hanneken's men, causing several deaths and injuries to the Marines.|$|E

5|$|Before Eline struck Mozambique, storm {{warnings}} and later hurricane warnings were issued on February21. Flooding had affected the nation since January, with some areas receiving a year's worth of rainfall in two weeks. Widespread areas were inundated, with about 220,000people displaced, and about 150people killed. Eline moved ashore with very powerful winds, {{although there were}} no direct observations of the strongest winds. In Beira, the closest major city to the landfall point, winds reached storm force. However, the rainfall from Eline was the most impacting following the preexisting flooding, which were the worst since 1951. The floods <b>were</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> recede by the time Eline arrived, {{and by the end}} of February 2000, the situation was considered the country's worst natural disaster in a century. Flooding continued for days after Eline moved through southern Africa due to waters flowing downstream from neighboring countries. By early March the floods <b>were</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> recede again, leaving behind a deep layer of mud, ponds of contaminated water, and piles of rotten corpses.|$|E
5|$|However, {{there was}} a desire among many women to participate, and in the 1990s large numbers of them began to create paintings.

5|$|Ideas {{about the}} nature of law in general <b>were</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> change. In 1716, the Septennial Act was passed, which had a number of consequences. First, it showed that Parliament no longer {{considered}} its previous statutes unassailable, as it provided for a maximum parliamentary term of seven years, whereas the Triennial Act (1694) (enacted {{less than a quarter of}} a century previously) had provided for a maximum term of three years.|$|E

5|$|In total, the Australians {{had about}} 2,292 {{personnel}} including {{those from the}} 53rd Infantry Battalion, positioned further back from Isurava, as well as support units including the 14th and 2/6th Field Ambulances, the Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit, the Royal Papuan Constabulary and the PIB. These troops <b>were</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> experience the strain of the jungle warfare: limited rations, inadequate personal equipment, harsh conditions and physical exertion were all beginning to sap their strength and instances of disease <b>were</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> decrease their effectiveness in the harsh terrain they were being asked to defend. At this stage the Australians' limited artillery resources were concentrated around Port Moresby, and due to difficulties in moving the guns forward along the track, the Australian defenders were without artillery support. Instead, the Australians had one 3-inch mortar, which was brought up to Isurava by the 2/14th Battalion part way through the battle after it was airdropped at Myola on 27 August.|$|E

5|$|Andersen biographer Jackie Wullschlager {{indicates}} that “Thumbelina” {{was the first}} of Andersen's tales to dramatize the sufferings of one who is different, and, as a result of being different, becomes the object of mockery. It was also the first of Andersen's tales to incorporate the swallow as the symbol of the poetic soul and Andersen’s identification with the swallow as a migratory bird whose pattern of life his own traveling days <b>were</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> resemble.|$|E

By October 7, 2010, total downtime for all websites attacked during Operation Payback was 537.55 hours.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1980s, the {{prognosis}} or expected outcome of DPB was poor, especially in cases with superinfection (the {{emergence of a}} new viral or bacterial infection, in addition to the currently occurring infection) by P.aeruginosa. DPB continued to have a very high mortality rate before generalized antibiotic treatment and oxygen therapy <b>were</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> be used routinely in the effort to manage symptoms. Around 1985, when long-term treatment with the antibiotic erythromycin became the standard for managing DPB, {{the prognosis}} significantly improved. In 1990, the association of DPB with HLA was initially asserted.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the opening}} of Melbourne Airport, Melbourne's main airport was Essendon Airport which was officially {{designated}} an international airport in 1950. In the mid-1950s, over 10,000 passengers were using Essendon Airport and the limitations of Essendon Airport <b>were</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> become apparent. Essendon Airport's facilities were insufficient to meet the increasing demand for air travel; the runways were too short to handle the then new jet airliners and the terminals failed to handle the increase in passengers, by the mid-1950s, an international overflow terminal was built in a new northern hangar. Due to the encroachment of the urban boundary, the airport had become surrounded by residential housing, meaning that expansion of Essendon Airport was not possible.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{favorable}} position {{toward the}} proposed federal constitution, Marshall {{was chosen as}} a delegate to the convention from Fayette County. On June 25, 1788, he joined Jefferson County delegates Robert Breckinridge and Rice Bullock in voting for ratification. Ten other Kentucky delegates opposed ratification and one abstained. The final convention vote was 8979 in favor of ratification. It was reported that even the Jefferson County delegates <b>were</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> waver in {{their commitment to the}} proposed constitution, but that Marshall steeled their resolve and also influenced several delegates from other parts of Virginia to favor it.|$|E

During his stay Bader met the Desoutter brothers, who <b>were</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> make lightweight artificial legs from aluminium. Once fitted with artificial legs, Bader fought hard to regain his former abilities and in time his efforts paid off. He was able to drive a specially modified car, play golf and even dance. During his convalescence, Bader met his future wife Thelma Edwards, a waitress at a nearby pub called the Pantiles.|$|E

The {{following}} day, they embarked on their boats, but General Grey decided that Fairhaven should also be raided. Concurrently, militia <b>were</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> arrive to defend Fairhaven, with Major Israel Fearing taking command from an elderly colonel who was reluctant to pursue an active defense. The British approached Fairhaven on the morning of September 6, and Fearing arrayed about 150 men between the village and their landing point. The British set fire to a few nearby buildings and then headed for the village. At this point, Fearing's men unleashed a withering volley of musket fire, and the British precipitately retreated to their boats.|$|E
5|$|In February 1828, {{shortly before}} his 41st birthday, Etty soundly {{defeated}} John Constable by 18 votes to five to become a full Royal Academician, {{at the time the}} highest honour available to an artist. By this time, complaints about his supposed indecency <b>were</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> resurface. All but one of the 15 paintings Etty exhibited at the Royal Academy in the 1820s had included at least one nude figure, and Etty was acquiring a reputation for using respectable themes as a pretext for nudity.|$|E

Although indirect conflict between Cold War powers continued through the late 1960s and early 1970s, tensions <b>were</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> ease.|$|E
