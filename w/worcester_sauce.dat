500|$|During the Eighth Army's retreat across Libya in 1941, the {{camouflage}} {{officer and}} former film art director Peter Proud and the camouflage sergeant William Murray Dixon found themselves {{trapped in the}} port city of Tobruk. Proud quickly set up a camouflage unit, acquiring a section of Australian engineers, a section of Royal Army Service Corps, and a company of Indian Pioneers (military labourers). Materials of all kinds were in short supply in the siege. Proud improvised, using scrap wood, salvaged textiles to make camouflage nets, and even foodstuffs—camouflage paint was made by mixing rancid flour with spoiled <b>Worcester</b> <b>sauce,</b> described by Barkas as [...] "a revolting but highly adhesive paste". Proud attracted the notice of army drivers by offering to camouflage their vehicles while they waited, with a sign advertising the [...] "Camouflage Service Station". The reason for the surprising offer was in itself a deception, requiring numerous vehicle tracks in an area away from actual targets to give enemy tactical reconnaissance planes the impression that dummy facilities, also built by Proud, were being visited intensively. Proud ran other camouflage schemes to protect three critical resources in besieged Tobruk: the harbour; the small Royal Air Force landing ground, with just three Hurricane fighters; and the town's water desalination plant, the town's main supply of drinking water.|$|E

Some few yellow-and-brown persons popped their heads out-of-doors, looking about like Welsh rabbits with <b>Worcester</b> <b>sauce</b> on em.

6000|$|After {{blowing off}} steam, we at once went a-fishing. The only {{remarkable}} {{result was the}} discovery that this corner of the Red Sea is a breeding-ground for sharks: we had not seen one in the Gulf of El-'Akabah, where last April they swarmed. Here, however, the school contained all sizes and every age, and they regarded us curiously with their cat's eyes, large, dark, and yellow-striped down the middle. A small specimen, that had just cut its teeth, was {{handed over to the}} cook, despite his loudly expressed disgust. The meat was somewhat mealy and shortfibred; but we pronounced in committee the seadog to be thoroughly eatable when corrected by pepper, garlic, and <b>Worcester</b> <b>sauce.</b> The corallines near the shore were finely developed: each bunch, like a tropical tree, formed a small zoological museum; and they supplied a variety of animalculae, including a tiny shrimp.

6000|$|... "I am {{bound to}} admit that conversations and amusements languished during that day. I was aware that Mame was getting a too {{prolonged}} one-sided view of things again, but I {{had no way to}} change it. Personally, I was wrapped up in the desire to eat. I had hallucinations of hash and visions of ham, and I kept saying to myself all the time, 'What'll you have to eat, Jeff?--what'll you order now, old man, when the waiter comes?' I picks out to myself all sorts of favourites from the bill of fare, and imagines them coming. I guess it's that way with all hungry men. They can't get their cogitations trained on anything but something to eat. It shows that the little table with the broken-legged caster and the imitation <b>Worcester</b> <b>sauce</b> and the napkin covering up the coffee stains is the paramount issue, after all, instead of the question of immortality or peace between nations.|$|E
60|$|It had originated, {{not with}} Innocent Smith, but with Michael Moon. He {{was in a}} strange glow and {{pressure}} of spirits, and talked incessantly; yet {{he had never been}} more sarcastic, and even inhuman. He used his old useless knowledge as a barrister to talk entertainingly of a tribunal that was a parody on the pompous anomalies of English law. The High Court of Beacon, he declared, was a splendid example of our free and sensible constitution. It had been founded by King John in defiance of the Magna Carta, and now held absolute power over windmills, wine and spirit licences, ladies traveling in Turkey, revision of sentences for dog-stealing and parricide, as well as anything whatever that happened in the town of Market Bosworth. The whole hundred and nine seneschals of the High Court of Beacon met once in every four centuries; but in the intervals (as Mr. Moon explained) the whole powers of the institution were vested in Mrs. Duke. Tossed about among the rest of the company, however, the High Court did not retain its historical and legal seriousness, but was used somewhat unscrupulously in a riot of domestic detail. If somebody spilt the <b>Worcester</b> <b>Sauce</b> on the tablecloth, he was quite sure it was a rite without which the sittings and findings of the Court would be invalid; or if somebody wanted a window to remain shut, he would suddenly remember that none but the third son of the lord of the manor of Penge had the right to open it. They even went to the length of making arrests and conducting criminal inquiries. The proposed trial of Moses Gould for patriotism was rather above the heads of the company, especially of the criminal; but the trial of Inglewood on a charge of photographic libel, and his triumphant acquittal upon a plea of insanity, were admitted to be in the best tradition of the Court.|$|E

5000|$|Another Captain David John Edwardes (Royal Horse Artillery) 14 Oct 1787-14 Apr 1866, {{grandson}} of Admiral Edwardes, {{served in the}} Peninsula War and {{was present at the}} Battle of Waterloo. He is credited with nearly capturing Joseph Bonaparte, brother of Napoleon, after the Battle of Vittoria. [...] Joseph escaped, but Captain Edwardes souvenired a set of razors, a carriage clock and some other personal items from his carriage, which are still held by descendants of the family. Captain David Edwardes served in the Royal Horse Artillery with Captain Henry Forster (1789-1855) of Southend, Kent. Following their return to England after the Battle of Waterloo, David Edwardes married Henrys’ sister Caroline Forster. Henry Forster went on to marry Elizabeth Fitzgibbon and his grandson become Henry William Forster (First and Last Baron Forster, Governor-General of Australia).Captain David John Edwardes had a brother, Captain Henry Lewis Edwardes J.P. (62nd Regiment) 3 Nov 1788-5 Aug 1866, who also served in the Napoleonic wars, but is mainly credited as the person who brought home from India, the recipe for the condiment which became known as <b>Worcester</b> <b>Sauce,</b> this is a fact in dispute though, as the introduction of <b>Worcester</b> <b>Sauce</b> is also credited to Lord Marcus Sandys. Captain Henry Lewis Edwardes changed his name to Henry Lewis Edwardes Gwynne in 1805, upon being left the Glanlery estate by his godfather, an heirless bachelor, Lewis Gwynne of Monachty, Cardigan. Captain Henry Lewis Edwardes Gwynne went on to become High Sheriff of Cardigan in 1832. [...] He is occasionally referred to as Edward Gwynne in some texts, due to confusion over his name change. In 1849, he was appointed Deputy Lieutenant of Carmarthen. and he died on 3 August 1866, aged 78 years, and was interred in the family vault at Llanllwch.|$|E
5000|$|On 20 January 2014, the pub was {{mentioned}} by Jim Dowd, MP for Lewisham West and Penge, during {{a debate in}} the House of Commons on the Intellectual Property Bill.

As Dowd was unfamiliar with Henderson's Relish he later cited the product {{as an example of}} [...] "parasitic copying", namely of the anchovy-based condiment sold under the Lea & Perrins name.

From 1930 until 1939, the Hall had pleasure gardens for the public, including an amusement park, a narrow gauge railway, tea dances, and children's playgrounds. He added an additional nine holes on the existing nine-hole golf course, designed by the noted golf course architect, Harry Colt, which later became the Lilleshall Hall Golf Club. However, it was not played on for 20 years owing to a rent dispute with farmers that resulted in cattle on the course. He even increased attendance by advertising that the German airship Hindenburg would fly over the estate even when its route was nowhere near; he explained {{that the lack of}} an airship was due to bad weather in a self-sent telegram.|$|E

By 1875 the number of agricultural tenants had increased fivefold to over 500, with around 1200 acre of arable land being improved.
