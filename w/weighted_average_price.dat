40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the price}} of a common basket of products sold in each of the UK’s four largest retail chains to assess propositions regarding price leadership. Data used in this investigation represent <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> <b>prices</b> of a large group of branded and non-branded products purchased nationally at weekly intervals over a three and half year period and cover purchases in 37 product categories. The data are analysed using vector autoregressive methods, a convenient framework for a statistical investigation of this sort, owing to the time series properties that the price data exhibit. The paper introduces the concepts of strategic and tactical price leadership. Since these correspond to parameter restrictions in the vector autoregression, the statistical tests have a economically meaningful interpretation. While the empirical findings are preliminary, they indicate that Tesco, the largest of the retail chains, acts as price leader in both the strategic and tactical senses. ...|$|R

Estimates of Gonzalo and Granger [J. Bus. Econ. Stat. 13 (1995) 27] plus Hasbrouck [J.

However, when there is high volatility or when observation intervals are lengthened, locals' contribution to price discovery declines. We conclude that although floor brokers are the main contributors, locals do play a significant role within the price discovery process. Kingsley Fong and Ralf Zurbruegg[URL]...|$|R
5000|$|A {{crossing}} {{network is}} an alternative trading system (ATS) that matches buy and sell orders electronically for execution without first routing the order to an exchange or other displayed market, such as an electronic communication network (ECN), which displays a public quote. These broker-dealers employ computerized systems to match buyers and sellers of large blocks of shares without using the stock exchange. Depending on the particular broker-dealer's system {{and the type of}} securities traded (e.g., exchange-listed or OTC securities), these crosses could occur at various times during the day, or after the close of trading, and could be priced at the last sale price or some other objective price, such as the midpoint between the bid and offer or the volume <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> <b>price</b> (VWAP). [...] The advantage of the crossing network is the ability to execute a large block order without impacting the public quote. Crossing networks tend to be used for highly liquid stocks and offer money managers the advantages of very low commissions (e.g., 1 to 2 cents per share or lower), anonymity for the buying or selling account, and avoidance of market impact (i.e., movements in a stock's price due to an investor's indication of interest).|$|E
5000|$|Another useful {{benchmark}} is {{the average}} price that customers pay for brands in a given category. This average can be calculated {{in at least two}} ways: (1) as the ratio of total category revenue to total category unit sales, or (2) as the unit-share <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> <b>price</b> in the category. Note that the market Average Price Paid includes the brand under consideration. Note also that changes in unit shares will affect the average price paid. If a low-price brand steals shares from a higher-priced rival, the average price paid will decline. This would cause a firm’s price premium (calculated using the average price paid as a benchmark) to rise, even if its absolute price did not change. Similarly, if a brand is priced at a premium, that premium will decline as it gains share. The reason: a market share gain by a premium-priced brand will cause the overall average price paid in its market to rise. This, in turn, will reduce the price differential between that brand and the market average[...] [...] [...] To calculate the price premium using the average price paid benchmark, managers can also divide a brand’s share of the market in value terms by its share in volume terms. If value and volume market shares are equal, there is no premium. If value share is greater than volume share, then there is a positive price premium.|$|E

40|$|Lack of {{international}} comparability in crude steel prices presents {{a problem in}} constructing an econometric model of the global steel market. The commonly used measures of crude steel <b>prices</b> are the <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> of the <b>prices</b> of steel products and the index of the <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> of <b>prices</b> based on a certain year. But {{in the context of}} constructing an econometric model of the global steel market, these measures are not comparable internationally. If the various product prices are cointegrated, it is appropriate to use the price of the most widely produced and traded product in the model (uncoated steel sheet) as an indicator of the general movement of crude steel prices. This paper concludes that the price of uncoated steel sheet cointegrates with the prices of other steel products in France and Germany. The same is not true of the United States, which may point to quality problems with the price data. Use of the price data of uncoated steel sheet as the indicator of crude steel prices in the global steel model would thus seem appropriate for capturing long-term price movements of various steel products.

Comparing {{the results of these}} scenarios promises more competitive market for the second scenario.
