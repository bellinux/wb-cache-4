50|$|<b>Water</b> <b>reducers</b> {{are special}} {{chemical}} products {{added to a}} concrete mixture before it is poured. They are from the same family of products as retarders. The first class of <b>water</b> <b>reducers</b> was the lignosulfonates which has been used since the 1930s.

50|$|SCC can be {{used for}} casting heavily {{reinforced}} sections, places where there can be no access to vibrators for compaction and in complex shapes of formwork which may otherwise be impossible to cast, giving a far superior surface than conventional concrete. The relatively high cost of material used in such concrete continues to hinder its widespread use in various segments of the construction industry, including commercial construction, however the productivity economics take over in achieving favorable performance benefits and works out to be economical in pre-cast industry. The incorporation of powder, including supplementary cementitious materials and filler, can increase the volume of the paste, hence enhancing deformability, and can also increase the cohesiveness of the paste and stability of the concrete. The reduction in cement content and increase in packing density of materials finer than 80 µm, like fly ash etc. can reduce the water-cement ratio, and the high-range <b>water</b> <b>reducer</b> (HRWR) demand. The reduction in free water can reduce the concentration of viscosity-enhancing admixture (VEA) necessary to ensure proper stability during casting and thereafter until the onset of hardening. It has been demonstrated that a total fine aggregate content ("fines", usually sand) of about 50% of total aggregate is appropriate in an SCC mix.|$|E

40|$|In this work, a lignin-based {{concrete}} <b>water</b> <b>reducer</b> {{was prepared}} through organic solvent fractionation and chemical modification of lignin extracted from pine wood with formic acid. The fractionated lignin with different molecular weight was modified via oxidation-sulfomethylation (OS), {{and the effects}} of fractionation on the performance of lignin-based concrete <b>water</b> <b>reducer</b> were investigated. It was found that the sulfonation degree (SD) of the fractionated lignin after OS was clearly higher compared to the unfractionated lignin, and the SD of fractionated lignin was linearly correlated with its workability (i. e., the fluidity of cement paste) based on the results obtained. By adding the same quantity of modified lignin-based concrete <b>water</b> <b>reducer,</b> the fluidity of cement paste with the fractionated lignin (by pure acetone) after OS modification was 21 % higher than the sulfonated FAL (M-FAL) without fractionation.

50|$|Plasticizers can {{be added}} to {{wallboard}} stucco mixtures to improve workability. In order to reduce the energy in drying wallboard, less water is added, which makes the gypsum mixture very unworkable and difficult to mix, necessitating the use of plasticizers, <b>water</b> <b>reducers</b> or dispersants. Some studies also show that too much of lignosulfonate dispersant could result in a set-retarding effect. Data showed that amorphous crystal formations occurred that detracted from the mechanical needle-like crystal interaction in the core, preventing a stronger core. The sugars, chelating agents in lignosulfonates such as Aldonic acids and extractive compounds are mainly responsible for set retardation. These low range water reducing dispersants are commonly manufactured from lignosulfonates, a by-product from the paper industry.|$|R
50|$|Superplasticizers, {{also known}} as high range <b>water</b> <b>reducers,</b> are {{chemical}} admixtures used where well-dispersed particle suspension is required.

Their addition to concrete or mortar allows {{the reduction of the}} water to cement ratio, not affecting the workability of the mixture, and enables the production of self-consolidating concrete and high performance concrete. This effect drastically improves the performance of the hardening fresh paste. The strength of concrete increases when the water to cement ratio decreases. However, their working mechanisms lack a full understanding, revealing in certain cases cement-superplasticizer incompatibilities.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Interaction between {{cement and}} a kind of sulfate {{compatible}} polycarboxylate type admixture (PCA) and action mechanism of the novel <b>water</b> <b>reducer</b> were investigated. Experimental results indicate that adsorption amount of PCA on surfaces of cement particles is lower than that of polynaphthalene sulfonate condensate <b>water</b> <b>reducer</b> (PNS) because of the formation of more ettringite and calcium monosulfoaluminate, and calcium monocarboaluminate when CaCO 3 presents in hydration system, even at initial period of hydration. Results from XRD analysis, derivative thermogravimetric (DTG) analysis and chemical analysis all verify the benificial effect of sulfate compatible PCA on initial and early age hydration of C 3 A. An establishment of electrostatic repulsion by grafting SO 3 in molecule structure of PCA may result in a more negative zeta potential in the dispersion system. The improved dispersibility and fluidity retention are the result of a combination action mechanism of electrostatic repulsion cooperating with steric hindrance, and the acceleration effect of sulfate compatible PCA on initial and early age formation of ettringite and AFm phase.

The study focused on 23 most commonly used concrete admixtures by the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT). They include air-entrainers, accelerators, retarders, <b>water</b> <b>reducers,</b> and other combinations of these admixtures. Their correlation coefficients were established by analyzing a total of 12 scans of each admixture from three different batches supplied by the manufacturer at different time intervals. In order to validate the obtained correlation coefficients and establish a target correlation, job samples were tested and compared to the obtained correlations.
