The use of reclaimed garments is a major element of Shelly Goldsmith's practice. Her work responds to the idea of memory and sense of self, and draws upon psychological and forensic theories associated with the cloths we wear, such as the notion of garments being laden with the wearer’s life; memories that may be retrieved and pieced together from the substances left behind on the clothes we wear. She works in a range of textile methods from hand stitch to digital sublimation printing...|$|R

To solve the key problem of palm-print recognition – feature extraction, we propose a new method, which based on wavelet transform and principal component analysis. In general, we use wavelet transform to deal <b>with</b> palm <b>print</b> <b>images</b> and extract high-dimensional wavelet energy features, then reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional wavelet energy features through principal component analysis, and remain the original feature energy maximally. The features extracted by this method not only reflect palm-print images’ information maximally, but also achieve the goal of data dimensionality reduction. Experiments show, the correct recognition rates of new method are much higher than those traditional methods such as LDA [1], PCA [2], 2 DPCA [3], ICA [4] and so on...|$|R
50|$|Oehlen {{studied at}} the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf (Alfonso Hüppi). His is {{formative}} participant of the German art movement Neue Wilde, which was especially active in Germany during the 1980s, and used a punk style that stood in opposition to minimalism. The aim was to attack the high-browed nature of minimalism with a style of painting {{that is based on}} instinct and gesturally emphasizes the wild, spontaneous, obsessive and sensual. Oehlen has continuously developed his work and, in parallel with painting, also works on sculptures and musical projects. His new works are increasingly inspired by the perceptual experiments of Op Art, <b>with</b> <b>printed</b> <b>image</b> interferences that occur in grid-like patterns above and below the layers of the picture. Along with forms that are oriented toward computer aesthetics, this brings an aspect of serialism to the images. It can be understood as a humorous and ironic commentary on the expressive nature of painting and - in retrospect - on the Neuen Wilden movement itself. Markus Oehlen's complex, layered pictures are composed of a plethora of found images, shapes and distorted painterly elements which, taken out of their previous context, take on a new function and meaning. By rearranging the individual compositional elements of the canvasses in the context of art, Oehlen creates surreal still lifes that were not originally so intended, playing with the notion of randomness and suggesting strange narratives. The pictures on large canvasses convince through their radical approach to painting.|$|R
40|$|Book synopsis: <b>Printed</b> <b>images</b> were {{ubiquitous}} in early modern Britain, {{and they often}} convey powerful messages which are {{all the more important}} for having circulated widely at the time. Yet, by comparison <b>with</b> <b>printed</b> texts, these <b>images</b> have been neglected, particularly by historians to whom they ought to be of the greatest interest. This volume helps remedy this state of affairs. Complementing the online digital library of British <b>Printed</b> <b>Images</b> to 1700 (www. bpi 1700. org. uk), it offers a series of essays which exemplify the many ways in which such visual material can throw light {{on the history of the}} period. Ranging from religion to politics, polemic to satire, natural science to consumer culture, the collection explores how <b>printed</b> <b>images</b> need to be read in terms of the visual syntax understood by contemporaries, their full meaning often only becoming clear when they are located in the context in which they were produced and deployed. The result is not only to illustrate the sheer richness of material of this kind, but also to underline the importance of the messages which it conveys, which often come across more strongly in visual form than through textual commentaries. With contributions from many leading exponents of the cultural history of early modern Britain, including experts on religion, politics, science and art, the book's appeal will be equally wide, demonstrating how every facet of British culture in the period can be illuminated through the study of <b>printed</b> <b>images...</b>|$|R

The feature extraction module is proposed to extract the ordinal measurements for the palm prints. The verification module is designed to verify the palm <b>print</b> <b>with</b> the personal identification record.

40|$|Strangely Entangled” {{explores the}} fraught {{relationship}} of Renaissance English poetry to its classical literary past. As English poetry began to shape {{itself into a}} distinctive kind and body of writing, the need for poetic models apart from those of ancient (and now Papist) Rome was strongly felt. The texts I examine, by Puttenham, Shakespeare, and Donne, address this challenge in three ways, updating, invoking and infusing themselves with alternative models. My introduction analyzes how contemporary, imported terms begin to take hold in English, engrafting themselves onto and thereby changing notions of classical authority. ^ Each of the subsequent three chapters describes how a specific Renaissance text infuses the literary precedents of antiquity with new, imported models. In each case, my analysis issues from a three-fold exploration of the philological, graphic, and formal particulars of each work. My first chapter argues that George Puttenham 2 ̆ 7 s The Arte of English Poesie cultivates a taste for the foreign by supplementing Greek and Latin poetic models <b>with</b> <b>printed</b> <b>images</b> of Turkish and Chinese forms. The second chapter reveals how zero, a recently imported Persian arithmetical symbol, infiltrates Shakespeare 2 ̆ 7 s representation of Rome in The Rape of Lucrece by interspersing the text with ciphers, zeros, and printed Os. In the earliest texts of the poem, where the pagination is still indicated by Roman numerals, Lucrece 2 ̆ 7 s apostrophic Os seem to leap off the page. While embracing interdisciplinary connections between philology and <b>printing,</b> text and <b>image,</b> East and West, and antique and modern, I keep questions of poetic form and value sharply in view. Working out the complex philological relationship between antique (ancient and venerated) and antic (savage, grotesque, outlandish) which in the English Renaissance shared the same spelling and pronunciation, the final chapter examines the relationship of English Renaissance poetry to its medieval past, and to classical antiquity, arguing that Donne 2 ̆ 7 s fascination with physical decay demonstrates a wish to separate the antic and the antique, {{or at least to}} place them on the same plane. Furthermore, the irregular metaphors that characterize Donne 2 ̆ 7 s metaphysical style imitate the antic grotesque. ...|$|R
