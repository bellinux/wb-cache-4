5|$|As {{a result}} of Communist rule in China, the social status of women {{improved}} greatly. Women were empowered to <b>work</b> <b>outside</b> the home.

China has seen a decrease in domestic violence due to government-supported grassroots programs to counter these practices. Women in rural areas remain largely uneducated.|$|E
5|$|In 1906 72 {{percent of}} Christian Scientists in the United States were female, against 49 {{percent of the}} population.

As Walt Disney Productions was {{being set up}} as a union shop, Walt Disney and several studio employees were sent by the US government on a Good Neighbor policy trip to Central and South America. The Disney strike and its aftermath led to an exodus of several animation professionals from the studio, from top-level animators such as Art Babbitt and Bill Tytla to artists better known for their <b>work</b> <b>outside</b> the Disney studio such as Frank Tashlin, Maurice Noble, Walt Kelly, Bill Meléndez, and John Hubley. Hubley, with several other Disney strikers, went on to found the United Productions of America studio, Disney's key animation rival in the 1950s.|$|E

5|$|Born into {{a wealthy}} family, whose forebears had been {{involved}} in ensuring Argentina's independence from Spain, she was not expected to <b>work</b> <b>outside</b> the home. Yet Ferrari not only chose to have a career, she insisted on participating in the male-dominated medical profession. She first earned a teaching diploma and became a school teacher, then graduated in medicine in 1911. After completing her residency, she applied to teach at the university level, but instead was offered a teaching post at the School of Midwifery. Outraged, she fought for 13 years against the prejudices which prevented her advancing in her career. In 1927, Ferrari won her fight and was granted a professorship as an alternate. Finally in 1939, she was awarded a full professorship.|$|E
5|$|By 1938, the Engineering Experiment Station was {{producing}} useful technology, and the station needed {{a method to}} conduct contract <b>work</b> <b>outside</b> the state budget.

It {{was created by the}} Chancellor of the University System and the president of Georgia Power Company, and the Engineering Experiment Station's director {{was a member of the}} council. The IDC later became the Georgia Tech Research Corporation, which currently serves as the sole contract organization for all Georgia Tech faculty and departments.

The problem {{of this study was}} to determine whether or not the self-esteem of high school age students was affected by whether or not their mother <b>worked</b> <b>outside</b> the home beyond school hours. The tools used in the evaluator process were: a questionnaire, Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory, and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. Results indicated that high school age children of mothers who <b>worked</b> <b>outside</b> the home beyond school hours exhibited lower self-esteem levels than did high school aged children of mothers who may have <b>worked</b> <b>outside</b> the home but not beyond school hours.

5|$|Just as {{the image}} of the wife in {{advertising}} has reflected the general views of the appropriate roles of a wife, images of the husband also reflect the cultural values surrounding what role was believed a husband should be engaged in. For example, over time, it is common find images of the husband as performing <b>work</b> <b>outside</b> of the home and taking care of the family finances. It has been noted that this role has been especially prevalent during 1920, 1936, and 1970. On the other hand, one is not likely to find an advertisement depicting husbands engaged in household chores, except when they are depicted as particularly bad at performing the housework. In addition, it has been noted that over time, the portrayal of husbands and wives in an intimate, romantic relationship has been on the rise.|$|E
