40|$|Abstract — The {{authors of}} this {{experimental}} research work have made an attempt to experimentally investigate the ultimate flexural load of ferrocement slabs of size 700 mm. X 200 mm. X 15 mm. (thickness) reinforced with PVC coated steel <b>weld</b> <b>mesh,</b> and compare the results with slabs using GI-coated steel <b>weld</b> <b>mesh,</b> by varying the number of layers from 1 - 3. Ordinary Portland Cement, locally available river sand and potable water {{have been used in}} preparation of cement mortar, and the sand-cement ratio of 2 : 1 and water-cement ratio of 0. 43 have been used in accordance with ACI codes. The flexural strength of ferrocement slabs was determined on four-point loading using a specially fabricated flexure loading frame. The flexural load, maximum deflection, crack-pattern and crack-width of ferrocement slabs reinforced have been analysed using varying PVC and GI coated <b>weld</b> <b>mesh</b> layers (1 - 3). Increasing the number of mesh layers from 1 - 3 caused a substantial increase in flexural load as well as improvement in ductility behavior of ferrocement slabs. It was also found that the flexural load of slabs with PVC-coated <b>weld</b> <b>mesh</b> is 90 % that of specimens reinforced with GI-coated <b>weld</b> <b>mesh,</b> and therefore, PVC-coated <b>weld</b> <b>mesh</b> can be effectively used in ferrocement slabs, as noncorrosive reinforcement...|$|R

50|$|Fence {{panels are}} {{supported}} with counter-weighted feet, {{have a wide}} variety of accessories including gates, handrails, feet and bracing depending on the application. Fence panels are commonly constructed of either chain link or <b>weld</b> <b>mesh.</b>|$|R
50|$|This kind of <b>welded</b> <b>mesh</b> wire is {{basically}} used in industrial fencing purposes. It {{is made up}} of stainless steel that has high strength and integrity. This corrosion resistance meshed wire is long lasting and is widely used in transportation, agricultural, mining, horticulture, entertainment and other service sectors.|$|E
50|$|This type of {{mesh wire}} is {{generally}} {{made up of}} plain steel wire. At the time of processing it goes through a hot zinc covering process.

50|$|Final {{choice of}} shaft lining is {{dependent}} on the geology of the rock which the shaft passes through, some shafts have several liners sections as required Where shafts are sunk in very competent rock there may be no requirement for lining at all, or just the installation of <b>welded</b> <b>mesh</b> and rock bolts. The material of choice for shaft lining is mass concrete which is poured behind Shaft Forms in Lifts of 6m as the shaft advances (gets deeper).|$|E
30|$|The beams {{reinforced}} with <b>welded</b> wire <b>mesh</b> achieved better cracking performance than those {{reinforced with}} X 8 expanded steel mesh {{regardless of the}} number of reinforcing steel layers and the type of core material. From the results in Tables  2 and 3, the ratio of the first cracking load of the <b>welded</b> wire <b>mesh</b> beams to that of the X 8 expanded steel mesh beams was 1.12, 1.33, 1.4, 1.2, 1.19 for (WSC/ESC), (WDC/EDC), (WSB/ESB), (WSS/ESS), and (WSR/ESR) respectively. The better performance of the beams reinforced with <b>welded</b> wire <b>mesh</b> could be attributed to the material properties of the two types of steel meshes which resulted in higher tensile strength of the mortar-mesh composite for the case of <b>welded</b> wire <b>mesh</b> in comparison to that of the X 8 expanded steel mesh as explained in Eqs. (4) and (5).|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to presents experimental results on the composite slab reinforced with steel fibre compared to prefabricated <b>welded</b> wire <b>mesh</b> in concrete topping; subjected to applied shear load. In order to achieve the objective, 24 composite slabs reinforced with different types and amounts of steel fibres were prepared.

The type of steel fibres was hooked-end deformed with different dimension, which are; length of 50 mm with diameter of 0. 75 mm and length of 33 mm with diameter of 0. 55 mm. Both types of steel fibres were cast as concrete topping with amounts of 0. 25, 0. 50, 0. 75 and 1. 00 percents volume fraction to that of concrete volume.

Five recycled concrete mixes with different coarse recycled aggregates replacement percentage have been realized. The slab dimensions are 1100 ⋅ 1100 ⋅ 50 mm and flexural reinforcement of all specimens has been realized by using two 100 ⋅ 100 mm <b>welded</b> <b>mesh</b> layers and wire diameter of 5 mm. Tensile strength, cylindrical compressive strength and modulus of elasticity of the concrete mixes have been estimated experimentally. The simply supported reinforced recycled concrete slabs have been tested under the action of central patch load in order to evaluate the central deflection - load curve. The experimental cracking load is determined on the curve as the linear limit load. The recycled concrete slabs show a similar behaviour to those realized with ordinary concrete.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to assess if {{traditionally}} used welded connectors for joining the two skins of reinforced concrete (RC) sandwich panels, used as structural walls and horizontal structural elements, can be substituted with bent ones. In this way, {{the scope of the}} effort is to reduce drastically the energy required during manufacturing, thus having a much more sustainable building product. Wire mesh on site production, in fact, requires a large amount of energy for the welding process, as stated by several Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). In addition, the production of sandwich panels with bent connectors requires a low level of automation and no qualified labor allowing the diffusion in developing countries. The procedures used to execute the work were both experimental and numerical. Structural performances were examined by testing full-scale sandwich panels under (axial and eccentric) compression and flexural loads. Additionally, a Finite Element (FE) study was developed to investigate and to optimize the dimension of <b>welded</b> <b>mesh</b> and the number of connectors. The major findings show {{that it is possible to}} substitute welded connectors with bent ones without compromising the structural performance of the tested RC sandwich panels, thus having a more sustainable way for producing these last ones...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of steel fibres as a {{replacement}} to the conventional reinforcement under flexural behaviour and punching shear in self-compacting (SCC) ribbed slab reinforced with steel fibres. Four ribbed slabs with similar dimensions of 2. 8 m length × 1. 2 m width and 0. 2 m thickness were constructed. Two of the samples were considered as control samples (conventionally reinforced with reinforcement bars and <b>welded</b> <b>mesh)</b> while another two samples were fully reinforced with 1 % (80 kg/m 3) volume of steel fibres incorporated to the SCC mix. For the flexural behaviour study, the ribbed slab samples were subjected to two line loads under four point bending. Meanwhile, for the punching shear analysis, the ribbed slab samples were subjected to a point load to simulate loading from the column. The analysis of the experimental results displayed that steel fibres incorporation had been found to effectively delay the first crack occurrence under both flexural and punching shear. The steel fibre replacement has been proven {{to be able to}} sustain up to 80 % and 73 % of the ultimate load resistance for flexural and punching shear, respectively, in comparison to conventionally reinforced ribbed slab structure. The visual observation carried out during the experiment exhibited similar failure mode for both steel fibre reinforced and control samples. This was observed for both flexural and punching shear samples. Overall, it can be concluded that the steel fibres had displayed a promising potential to effectively replace the conventional reinforcements...|$|E
