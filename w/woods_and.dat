Matthews and associated parties counterclaimed that <b>Woods</b> <b>and</b> his company, ETW Corporation, committed several acts including breach of contract, breach of implied duty of good faith, and violations of Florida's Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act. Palmer was also named in the counter-suit, accused of violating the same licensing agreement in conjunction with his company Arnold Palmer Enterprises.|$|E

40|$|Aim: Recent meta-analyses have {{revealed}} that plant traits and their phylogenetic history influence decay rates of dead <b>wood</b> <b>and</b> leaf litter, but it remains unknown if decay rates of <b>wood</b> <b>and</b> litter covary {{over a wide range}} of tree species and across ecosystems. We evaluated the relationships between species-specific <b>wood</b> <b>and</b> leaf litter decomposability, as well as between <b>wood</b> <b>and</b> leaf traits that control their respective decomposability. Location: Global. Methods: We compiled data on rates of <b>wood</b> <b>and</b> leaf litter decomposition for 324 and 635 tree species, respectively, and data on six functional traits for both organs.

5|$|After {{passing through}} Hyattstown, MD355 crosses into Frederick County, where it becomes Urbana Pike. Here, it passes some {{businesses}} before intersecting MD 75 (Green Valley Road). Past this intersection, the road continues {{into a more}} rural setting consisting of farmland, <b>woods,</b> <b>and</b> some residential areas and businesses. The route reaches Urbana, where it heads onto a four lane divided bypass called Worthington Boulevard {{to the east of}} the community, while the former alignment of MD355 continues through Urbana as MD 355 Bus. MD355 intersects MD 80 (Fingerboard Road) and passes through residential areas in the Villages of Urbana subdivision, encountering two roundabouts. Upon leaving Urbana, the route intersects MD 355 Bus. again and returns to its original alignment on two-lane undivided Urbana Pike as it continues north through areas of <b>woods</b> <b>and</b> farms with some rural residences. The road passes Monocacy National Battlefield, the site of the Battle of Monocacy Junction in the American Civil War fought on July 9, 1864. Past the battlefield, the road crosses the Monocacy River and a CSX railroad line.|$|E

40|$|Attention {{is drawn}} to the {{relatively}} low number of Ipomoea species found in the Amazon basin {{as well as to}} the rarity of most species restricted to the region.

40|$|The {{consumption}} of <b>wood</b> <b>and</b> <b>wood</b> products in Greece is based greatly on imports necessitating every year a great proportion of public expenditures. The study of <b>wood</b> <b>and</b> <b>wood</b> product imports consequently, {{is important to}} the national economy and can be a useful guide for the forest farms, <b>wood</b> industries <b>and</b> <b>wood</b> firms. In this paper the Greek aggregate import demand for Unprocessed wood (such as logs) Processed wood (such as sawn wood), Veneer Crafts (such as veneer sheets) <b>and</b> <b>Wood</b> Manufactures during the period 1969 - 2001 is empirically analysed using the linear approximation of quadratic AIDS (QUAIDS) model. Imports of Unprocessed <b>wood,</b> Veneer Crafts <b>and</b> <b>Wood</b> Manufactures are found to be price-elastic, in contrast to Processed wood imports. Processed <b>wood,</b> Veneer Crafts <b>and</b> <b>Wood</b> Manufacture imports are found to be expenditure-elastic while Unprocessed wood is found to be an inferior good.
