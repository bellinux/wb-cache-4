5|$|Due to a quirk in legislation, the <b>West</b> <b>Berlin</b> {{parts of}} the Stadtbahn belonged to the Deutsche Reichsbahn, which made it (and {{therefore}} the GDR government) {{one of the largest}} landowners in <b>West</b> <b>Berlin.</b> Regular quarrels erupted between the DR, the GDR government, the <b>West</b> <b>Berlin</b> Senate and the Allied occupation powers.|$|E
5|$|On 9 January 1984 {{a treaty}} between the GDR and the <b>West</b> <b>Berlin</b> Senate came into force {{and turned over}} the {{responsibility}} for operation of the S-Bahn in <b>West</b> <b>Berlin</b> to the <b>West</b> <b>Berlin</b> transport authority, the Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe. Soon thereafter, talks with the GDR commenced regarding improvements of the Stadtbahn in <b>West</b> <b>Berlin</b> {{as well as the}} modernisation of the Zoologischer Garten station. The Lehrter Stadtbahnhof was also carefully restored to its original 1880s look and became a listed building. In East Berlin, the Ostbahnhof was partially rebuilt and renamed to Hauptbahnhof, in time for the 750th anniversary of Berlin's founding in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Prices for the <b>West</b> <b>Berlin</b> S-Bahn {{were kept}} {{slightly}} below the fares of the <b>West</b> <b>Berlin</b> BVG. In East Berlin, a flat fee of 0.20 Mark was charged until 1991. <b>West</b> <b>Berlin</b> politics {{and most of}} the populace fully boycotted the S-Bahn, which was run by the East German railways, and introduced bus and U-Bahn lines running parallel to the S-Bahn network and the Stadtbahn.|$|E

5|$|From 1981 to 1983, Weizsäcker {{headed a}} {{minority}} government in <b>West</b> <b>Berlin,</b> after the CDU had only won 48 per cent {{of seats in}} the state assembly. His government was tolerated by the Free Democratic Party, who were in a coalition with the Social Democrats {{at the federal level}} at the time. After Helmut Kohl had won the federal election in 1983 and had formed a government with the Free Democrats, Weizsäcker did the same in <b>West</b> <b>Berlin.</b>|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the number}} of S-Bahn lines running in <b>West</b> <b>Berlin</b> was reduced to just three as a {{consequence}} of a strike carried out by the Deutsche Reichsbahn's West Berlin-based employees in September 1980.|$|E

5|$|After the Berlin Wall {{was built}} in 1961, Zoologischer Garten became the <b>West</b> <b>Berlin</b> and Ostbahnhof the East Berlin de facto central station. The station Friedrichstraße now was the {{terminal}} point of the separated West and East Berlin S-Bahn lines and departure point for the Interzonenzug (Inter-zone train) services between <b>West</b> <b>Berlin</b> and West Germany. Friedrichstraße station was separated into Eastern and Western parts with steel walls, and enabled West Berliners to change to S-Bahn trains running on the Nord-Süd-Bahn and the U6 line of the Berlin U-Bahn without passing through GDR border controls. The station also featured a border crossing into East Berlin.|$|E
5|$|From 18 May 1952, {{when all}} Berlin {{terminal}} stations {{and all other}} long-distance stations in <b>West</b> <b>Berlin</b> were closed, the station Zoologischer Garten remained the only long-distance station for {{the western part of}} the city. The last domestic train of the GDR (East German) railways ran on the Stadtbahn in 1953.|$|E

In 1984, von Weizsäcker was elected as President of the Federal Republic of Germany.

5|$|Arriving in Berlin on June 12, 1987, President and Mrs. Reagan {{were taken}} to the Reichstag, where they viewed the wall from a balcony.

Among the spectators were West German president Richard von Weizsäcker, Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and <b>West</b> <b>Berlin</b> mayor Eberhard Diepgen.|$|E
5|$|As {{the press}} conference had been {{broadcast}} live, within hours, thousands of people gathered at the Berlin Wall demanding that the guards open the gates. The border guards were unable to contact their superiors for instructions and, fearing a stampede, opened the gates.

After that, he settled in Vienna. He returned to Poland in 1988.|$|E
5|$|The {{cases that}} were known in <b>West</b> <b>Berlin</b> {{provoked}} demonstrations among the population. Members of the Senate inspected the crime scenes {{and spoke to}} the press as well as public audiences. Various groups, and also individuals, launched protest campaigns against the Wall and the shootings. The fact that Peter Fechter bled to death in plain view of the public without anybody being able to help him lead to spontaneous mass demonstrations, which in turn resulted in riots in the following night. <b>West</b> <b>Berlin</b> policemen and US soldiers prevented a storming of the Wall. Buses bringing Soviet soldiers to the Tiergarten where they were to guard the Soviet War Memorial were pelted with stones by protesters. The incident also lead to anti-American protests, which were condemned by Willy Brandt. In the ensuing time, loudspeaker cars were sporadically set up at the Wall, urging the GDR border guards not to shoot at refugees and warning them of possible consequences. As a result of the shootings, West German groups lodged complaints with the UN Commission on Human Rights. The non-partisan Kuratorium Unteilbares Deutschland (Committee for an Indivisible Germany) sold protest placards and lapel pins in all of West Germany against the border regime and its consequences. Initially, West Berlin's regulatory authorities gave fugitives covering fire if they were being fired at by GDR border guards. This resulted in at least one lethal incident on 23 May 1962, when the border guard Peter Göring was shot dead by a <b>West</b> <b>Berlin</b> policeman while firing 44 times at a fleeing boy.|$|E

5|$|After the war, he {{was tried}} at Nuremberg {{and sentenced to}} 20 {{years in prison for}} his role in the Nazi regime, principally for the use of forced labor. Despite {{repeated}} attempts to gain early release, he served his full sentence, most of it at Spandau Prison in <b>West</b> <b>Berlin.</b> Following his release in 1966, Speer published two bestselling autobiographical works, Inside the Third Reich and , detailing his close personal relationship with Hitler, and providing readers and historians with a unique perspective on the workings of the Nazi regime. He later wrote a third book, Infiltration, about the SS. Speer died of a stroke in 1981 while on a visit to London.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{appeals for}} Hess's release were {{launched}} by his lawyer, Dr Alfred Seidl, beginning {{as early as}} 1947. These were denied, mainly because the Soviets repeatedly vetoed the proposal. Spandau was located in <b>West</b> <b>Berlin,</b> and its existence gave the Soviets a foothold in that sector of the city. Additionally, Soviet officials believed Hess must have known in 1941 that an attack on their country was imminent. In 1967 Wolf Rüdiger Hess began a campaign to win his father's release, garnering support from notable politicians such as Geoffrey Lawrence, 1st Baron Oaksey in Britain and Willy Brandt in Germany, but to no avail, {{in spite of the}} prisoner's advanced age and deteriorating health.|$|E
5|$|The one {{exception}} to the general rule of concealment and obfuscation was that of border guards who died on duty. Most were killed either deliberately or accidentally by escapees or escape helpers. The dead guards were hailed by East German government propaganda as heroes, but West German public opinion was divided about the morality of killing border guards. Some took the view that escapees were entitled to use force {{in the course of}} crossing the border, but (as in one case tried in a <b>West</b> <b>Berlin</b> court) others saw the guard's life as taking priority over an escapee's freedom.|$|E
