5|$|All around are pubs and brothels. The Earl of Cardigan tavern is on {{one side}} of the street, and {{opposite}} is the Rummer, whose sign shows a rummer (a short wide-brimmed glass) <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> grapes on the pole. Masonic lodges met in both taverns during the 1730s, and the Lodge at the Rummer and Grapes in nearby Channel Row was the smartest of the four founders of the Grand Lodge. The publican is adulterating a hogshead of wine, a practice recalled in the poetry of Matthew Prior who lived with his uncle Samuel Prior, the Landlord successively of both the Rummer and Grapes and the Rummer".|$|E
5|$|Later on the bridge, Data is {{reviewing}} {{the information from}} the probes sent into the nebula. He theorises that life might have evolved differently in the nebula because of the volume of dark matter detected. Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) orders the ship to the nearest planet within the nebula. Data and D'Sora configure further probes, when she kisses him on the cheek and then on the lips, before leaving the room. Data seeks the opinion of his friends, including Picard, Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg), Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton), Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes), Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) and Worf (Michael Dorn). Data decides to pursue the relationship and goes to D'Sora's cabin <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> flowers, where he informs her that he created a romantic subroutine for the relationship.|$|E

Of course, I don't know that any of these men will apply for reinstatement, but if they do, the above are at least a few of the rules that will be enforced.

25|$|In {{the next}} match, Lex Luger defended the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship against Ricky Steamboat in a No Disqualification match. However, Luger protested and wanted the match to occur with count-outs and {{disqualifications}} in effect. Steamboat agreed. Steamboat started the match <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> roll-ups. Steamboat delivered several moves {{to dominate the}} early part of the match. Luger kicked Steamboat out of the ring and attacked him outside the ring but Steamboat delivered a Chop to Luger. Steamboat tried to deliver a Diving Mongolian Chop but Luger countered with many of high-impact moves. He made a pinfall attempt but got a near-fall. He got another near-fall and complained that he was not getting a fast count. He started clotheslining Steamboat and argued with referee Tommy Young. Steamboat took advantage and delivered a Crossbody for a near-fall. Luger started regaining momentum by hitting power moves on Steamboat. Steamboat countered Luger and delivered a Diving Mongolian Chop but got a near-fall. Luger stayed with the ropes. Steamboat tried to attack Luger but Luger delivered a Back Body Drop to Steamboat, sending him into the other ring. Luger shoved the referee and brought a chair. Steamboat delivered a Catapult to Luger and started attacking Luger with a chair to get disqualified. As a result, Luger won the match and retained the United States Heavyweight Championship. Steamboat continued to attack Luger with the chair after the match.|$|E

500|$|The game {{contains}} weapons {{based on}} non-fictional firearms, such as pistols, assault rifles, and submachine guns, {{as well as}} entirely fictional armaments like particle beam weapons. Each firearm differs in terms of ammunition type, accuracy, range, fire rate, damage, and bulkiness. The latter characteristic is crucial, as more powerful/specialized weapons {{tend to be more}} cumbersome and slow the player's maneuvers. Unlike other games of the genre where lighter/smaller weapons tend to be useless, F.E.A.R. does not scale guns on a curve, so any firearm is potentially deadly in most situations. Monolith Productions stated that it aimed for [...] "... a balanced arsenal where each weapon serves a specific function", rather than [...] "... just going <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> real-world submachine guns and assault rifles." [...] F.E.A.R.s heads-up display crosshair's size dynamically shows where shots will fall based on movement, aim, and the weapon in use. The player may carry only three firearms at a time; thus, strategy is required when using and selecting weapons.|$|E
