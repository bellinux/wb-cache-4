40|$|A {{combination}} of genetically-encoded calcium indicators and micro-optics has enabled monitoring of large-scale dynamics of neuronal activity from behaving animals. In these studies, <b>wide-field</b> <b>microscopy</b> {{is often used}} to visualize neural activity. However, this method lacks optical sectioning capability, and therefore its axial resolution is generally poor. At present, it is unclear whether <b>wide-field</b> <b>microscopy</b> can visualize activity of densely packed small neurons at cellular resolution. To examine the applicability of <b>wide-field</b> <b>microscopy</b> for small-sized neurons, we recorded calcium activity of dentate granule cells having a small soma diameter of approximately 10 micrometers.

25|$|<b>Wide-field</b> multiphoton <b>microscopy</b> {{refers to}} an optical {{non-linear}} imaging technique tailored for ultrafast imaging in which a large area of the object is illuminated and imaged {{without the need for}} scanning. High intensities are required to induce non-linear optical processes such as two-photon fluorescence or second harmonic generation. In scanning multiphoton microscopes the high intensities are achieved by tightly focusing the light, and the image is obtained by stage- or beam-scanning the sample. In <b>wide-field</b> multiphoton <b>microscopy</b> the high intensities are best achieved using an optically amplified pulsed laser source to attain a large field of view (~100µm). The image in this case is obtained as a single frame with a CCD without the need of scanning, making the technique particularly useful to visualize dynamic processes simultaneously across the object of interest. With <b>wide-field</b> multiphoton <b>microscopy</b> the frame rate can be increased up to a 1000-fold compared to multiphoton scanning microscopy.|$|R

40|$|In {{functional}} brain-imaging {{the advantage}} of <b>wide-field</b> <b>microscopy</b> versus the frequently used laser-scanning microscopy {{is the possibility of}} simultaneous recording at different locations with high speed. However, in doing so depth discrimination of the signals is very restricted. In this thesis it is investigated for the first time how the method of structured illumination which introduces optical sectioning into <b>wide-field</b> <b>microscopy</b> can be used for functional brain imaging. A new technique of grating movement for high speed recording with high velocity and a new algorithm to extract fast and weak in-focus signals had to be developed. Thus functional signals could be detected in vitro. Furthermore it was shown in vivo how out-of-focus light lets the intensity of in-focus structures seem reversed in the conventional wide field image. In comparison to the conventional wide-field microscope the signal-to-noise ratio is reduced by light detected from beyond the optical sectioning strength before the sectioning algorithm is applied. Hence the optical sectioning strength used in laser scanning microscopy is not applicable here. A sectioning strength of 90 micrometers which roughly corresponds to the thickness of one cortical layer in mouse was realized. The second relevant factor for the signal-to-noise ratio was scattering in the brain which diminished the in-focus modulation. Its effect can be reduced by a longer excitation wavelength and wider grating bars without strongly broadening sectioning strength...|$|E

40|$|Optical {{micromanipulation}} {{of particles}} {{based on the}} optical trapping effect induced by the interaction between light and particles has been successfully applied to many interdisciplinary fields including biomedicine and material sciences. When particles are trapped in three dimensions, the conventional <b>wide-field</b> optical <b>microscopy</b> can only monitor {{the movement of the}} trapped particles in a certain transverse plane. The ability to observe the particle movement along light trajectories is limited. Recently, a novel method named axial plane optical microscopy (APOM) has been developed to directly image the axial plane that is parallel to the optical axis of an objective lens. The APOM observes the axial plane by converting the axial information of a sample into that of a transverse plane by using a 45 degrees-tilted mirror. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate that the APOM serves as an effective tool for observing the axial movement of particles in optical tweezers. By combining with a conventional <b>wide-field</b> optical <b>microscopy,</b> we show that both transverse and axial information can be acquired simultaneously for the optical micromanipulation. As in our first experimental demonstration, we observe two particles which are trapped and aligned along the optical axis. From the transverse image, only one particle is observable, {{and it is difficult to}} obtain the information along the axial direction. However, in the axial plane imaging, the longitudinal dipolar structure formed by the two particles is clearly visible. This clearly demonstrates the APOM imaging capability along the axial axis. The numerically simulations on the trapping focal spot against the position of a collimating lens agree well with our experimental APOM results. Furthermore, we directly observe the dynamic capture process of a single trapped particle in transverse plane by conventional <b>wide-field</b> optical <b>microscopy</b> as well in axial plane by the APOM, and can obtain the 3 D information rapidly and simultaneously. We point out that the observable axial dynamic range is about 30 mu m. Taking advantages of no requirement of scanning and data reconstruction, the APOM has potential applications in many fields, including optical trapping with novel beams and 3 D imaging of thick biological specimens. </p...|$|R

40|$|When excited with {{rotating}} linear polarized light, differently oriented fluorescent dyes emit {{periodic signals}} peaking at different times. We show that {{measurement of the}} average orientation of fluorescent dyes attached to rigid sample structures mapped to regularly defined (50 nm) (2) image nanoareas can provide subdiffraction resolution (super resolution by polarization demodulation, SPoD). Because the polarization angle range for effective excitation of an oriented molecule is rather broad and unspecific, we narrowed this range by simultaneous irradiation with a second, de-excitation, beam possessing a polarization perpendicular to the excitation beam (excitation polarization angle narrowing, ExPAN). This shortened the periodic emission flashes, allowing better discrimination between molecules or nanoareas.
