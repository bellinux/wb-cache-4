5|$|Attempts {{are ongoing}} to infect the {{mosquito}} population with bacteria of the <b>Wolbachia</b> genus, {{which makes the}} mosquitoes partially resistant to dengue virus. While artificially induced infections with <b>Wolbachia</b> is effective, it is unclear if naturally acquired infections are protective. Working is still ongoing as of 2015 {{to determine the best}} type of <b>Wolbachia</b> to use.|$|E
5|$|Thrips are haplodiploid with haploid males (from unfertilised eggs, as in Hymenoptera) and diploid females {{capable of}} {{parthenogenesis}} (reproducing without fertilisation), many species using arrhenotoky, a few using thelytoky. The sex-determining bacterial endosymbiont <b>Wolbachia</b> {{is a factor}} that affects the reproductive mode. Several normally bisexual species have become established in the United States with only females present.|$|E
5|$|In wasps, as {{in other}} Hymenoptera, sex is {{determined}} by a haplodiploid system, which means that females are unusually closely related to their sisters, enabling kin selection to favour the evolution of eusocial behaviour. Females are diploid, meaning that they have 2n chromosomes and develop from fertilized eggs. Males have a haploid (n) number of chromosomes and develop from an unfertilized egg. Wasps store sperm inside their body and control its release for each individual egg as it is laid; if a female wishes to produce a male egg, she simply lays the egg without fertilizing it. Therefore, under most conditions in most species, wasps have complete voluntary control over the sex of their offspring. Experimental infection of Muscidifurax uniraptor with the bacterium <b>Wolbachia</b> induced thelytokous reproduction and an inability to produce fertile, viable male offspring.|$|E
25|$|Also, {{bidirectional}} cytoplasmic incompatibility {{occurs when}} an infected male carrying one strain of <b>Wolbachia</b> reproduces with an infected female carrying a different strain of <b>Wolbachia.</b> This also results in failed reproduction. Bidirectional cytoplasmic incompatibility also has evolutionary implications for populations of Ae. albopictus and other vectors of the infection. This is because bidirectional cytoplasmic incompatibility in <b>Wolbachia</b> creates unviable offspring, reducing gene flow between two populations, which can {{eventually lead to}} speciation.|$|E
25|$|Infection {{was reduced}} in {{mosquitoes}} with the wMel strain of <b>Wolbachia.</b>|$|E
25|$|This {{species has}} been found to be {{parasitised}} by multiple strains of <b>Wolbachia.</b> These bacteria can alter the sex ratios of the species.|$|E
25|$|As stated, {{males are}} known, but are very rare. One {{possible}} {{reason for this}} scarcity {{is the presence of}} a bacterium in the genus <b>Wolbachia,</b> which is endosymbiotic in the females' gametes. A female infected with <b>Wolbachia</b> produces only diploid eggs, when in the cells of the ovaries presumably cause the fusion of the pronuclei, which leads to entirely female progeny. When the females were treated with antibiotics, they were then able to produce normal male and female eggs.|$|E
25|$|Tsetse flies {{have three}} {{distinct}} symbionts. The primary symbiont is Wigglesworthia within the flys' bacteriocytes, the secondary symbiont is Sodalis intercellularly or intracellularly, {{and the third}} is some kind of <b>Wolbachia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Parasitic {{bacteria}} like <b>Wolbachia</b> {{have been}} noted to induce automictic thelytoky in many insect species with haplodiploid systems. They also cause gamete duplication in unfertilized eggs causing them to develop into female offspring.|$|E
25|$|This type of cytoplasmic {{incompatibility}} {{where an}} infected male cannot reproduce successfully with an uninfected female is called unidirectional cytoplasmic incompatibility. It occurs because <b>Wolbachia</b> modifies the paternal chromosomes during sperm development, leading to complications for these offspring during embryonic development.|$|E
25|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} occurs {{through the}} clustered or scattered deposition of spermatophores by male adults. Stimulation of spermatophore deposition by female pheromones {{has been demonstrated}} in Sinella curviseta. Mating behaviour {{can be observed in}} Symphypleona. Among Symphypleona, males of some Sminthuridae use a clasping organ located on their antenna. Many collembolan species, mostly those living in deeper soil horizons, are parthenogenetic, which favours reproduction to the detriment of genetic diversity and thereby to population tolerance of environmental hazards. Parthenogenesis (also called thelytoky) is under the control of symbiotic bacteria of the genus <b>Wolbachia,</b> which live, reproduce and are carried in female reproductive organs and eggs of Collembola. Feminizing <b>Wolbachia</b> species are widespread in arthropods and nematodes, where they co-evolved with most of their lineages.|$|E
25|$|Doxycycline {{kills the}} {{symbiotic}} <b>Wolbachia</b> {{bacteria in the}} reproductive tracts of parasitic filarial nematodes, making the nematodes sterile, and thus reducing transmission of diseases such as onchocerciasis and elephantiasis. Field trials in 2005 showed an eight-week course of doxycycline almost completely eliminates the release of microfilariae.|$|E
25|$|A {{detailed}} study of many M. smithii populations across their geographic distribution range (Mexico to Argentina) showed that some M. smithii populations in the Brazilian Amazon reproduce sexually. This was demonstrated using highly variable genetic markers. Sperm was also found stored in the spermathecas of queens. Sexual reproduction was suggested as a mechanism for maintaining the genetic diversity seen in this species. In summary, M. smithii is not purely asexual, but instead consists of a “mosaic” of sexual and asexual populations. Phylogenetic reconstructions and the biology of the species suggest that these sexual populations {{gave rise to the}} asexual ones. The mechanism behind the shift to asexuality is still unknown. However, antibiotic assays and genetic screenings suggest that it is not an endosymbiont such as <b>Wolbachia</b> causing the asexuality. In fact, a comparative analysis showed that <b>Wolbachia</b> endosymbionts do not seem to cause asexuality in ants in general.|$|E
25|$|On the Samoan Islands of Upolu and Savai'i, a {{parasite}} (probably <b>Wolbachia)</b> had been killing the male members of Hypolimnas bolina. The problem was {{so severe that}} by 2001, males made up only 1% of the population. However, in 2007, {{it was reported that}} within a span of just 10 generations (about 5 years), the males had evolved to develop immunity to the parasite, and the male population increased to nearly 40%.|$|E
25|$|After {{about four}} days the eggs hatch. The {{caterpillars}} immediately disperse. They are black with an orange head. The last segment is also orange. The head bears {{a pair of}} long branched black horns. The body surface is also covered with long, branched, orangish black spines. These spines look whitish and transparent immediately after moulting, but soon become the usual orange. In later instars the spiracles are surrounded by thin, dirty orange rings. Infection by <b>Wolbachia</b> bacteria is known to exclusively kill male specimens.|$|E
25|$|Flies in {{the genus}} Pseudacteon (phorid flies) {{are known to}} be {{parasitic}} to ants. These flies are parasitoids of the red imported fire ant in its native range in South America, and can be attracted through the ants' venom alkaloids. One species, Pseudacteon obtusus, attacks the ant by landing on the posterioral portion of the head and laying an egg. The location of the egg makes it impossible for the ant to successfully remove it. The larvae migrate to the head, then develop by feeding on the hemolymph, muscle tissue, and nervous tissue. After about two weeks, they cause the ant's head to fall off by releasing an enzyme that dissolves the membrane attaching the head to its body. The fly pupates in the detached head capsule, emerging two weeks later. P. tricuspis is another phorid fly that is a parasitoid to this species. Although parasitism pressures by these flies do not affect the ants' population density and activity, it has a small effect on a colony population. The strepsipteran insect Caenocholax fenyesi is known to infect male ants of this species and attack the eggs, and the mite Pyemotes tritici has been considered a potential biological agent against red imported fire ants, capable of parasitising every caste within the colony. Bacteria, such as <b>Wolbachia,</b> has been found in the red imported fire ant; three different variants of the bacteria are known to infect the red imported fire ant. However, its effect on the ant is unknown. Solenopsis daguerrei is a reproductive parasite to red imported fire ant colonies.|$|E
500|$|Natural {{selection}} {{is seen in}} action {{in the development of}} antibiotic resistance in microorganisms. Since the discovery of penicillin in 1928, antibiotics have been used to fight bacterial diseases. The widespread misuse of antibiotics has selected for microbial resistance to antibiotics in clinical use, {{to the point that the}} methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has been described as a [...] "superbug" [...] because of the threat it poses to health and its relative invulnerability to existing drugs. Response strategies typically include the use of different, stronger antibiotics; however, new strains of MRSA have recently emerged that are resistant even to these drugs. This is an evolutionary arms race, in which bacteria develop strains less susceptible to antibiotics, while medical researchers attempt to develop new antibiotics that can kill them. A similar situation occurs with pesticide resistance in plants and insects. Arms races are not necessarily induced by man; a well-documented example involves the spread of a gene in the butterfly Hypolimnas bolina suppressing male-killing activity by <b>Wolbachia</b> bacteria parasites on the island of Samoa, where the spread of the gene is known to have occurred over a period of just five years ...|$|E
2500|$|The Asian tiger {{mosquito}} {{is known for}} transmitting the <b>Wolbachia</b> infection. This bacterial genus {{is the most common}} infection in arthropods today, and over 40% of arthropods have contracted it. <b>Wolbachia</b> can be transmitted from parent to offspring or between breeding individuals. <b>Wolbachia</b> is easily transmitted within the Ae. albopictus mosquito due to the effects it has on fecundity in females. Once female Asian {{tiger mosquito}}s have contracted the infection, they produce more eggs, give birth more frequently, and live longer than uninfected females. In this way, <b>Wolbachia</b> provides a fitness advantage to the infected females and prevents uninfected females from reproducing. This allows control of the spread of diseases that many species carry by suppressing reproduction of the individuals with the harmful disease, but without the <b>Wolbachia</b> infection. <b>Wolbachia</b> {{can also be used to}} transfer certain genes into the population to further control the spread of diseases.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Wolbachia</b> pipientis is an {{intracellular}} bacterium {{that is an}} endosymbiont of D. immitis. [...] All heartworms {{are thought}} to be infected with <b>Wolbachia</b> to some degree. [...] The inflammation occurring at the die-off of adult heartworms or larvae is in part due to the release of <b>Wolbachia</b> bacteria or protein into the tissues. [...] This may be particularly significant in cats, in which the disease seems to be more related to larval death than living adult heartworms. [...] Treating heartworm-positive animals with an antibiotic such as doxycycline to remove <b>Wolbachia</b> may prove to be beneficial, but further studies are necessary.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the natural}} environment, <b>Wolbachia</b> and the Asian tiger {{mosquito}} {{are in a}} symbiotic relationship, so both species benefit {{from each other and}} can evolve together. The relationship between <b>Wolbachia</b> and its host might not have always been mutualistic, as Drosophila populations once experienced decreased fecundity in infected females, suggesting that <b>Wolbachia</b> evolved over time so that infected individuals would actually reproduce much more. The mechanism by which <b>Wolbachia</b> is inherited through maternal heredity is called cytoplasmic incompatibility. This changes the gamete cells of males and females, making some individuals unable to mate with each other. Although little is known about why cytoplasmic incompatibility exists, [...] <b>Wolbachia</b> infection creates a fitness advantage for infected females, as they can mate with either infected or uninfected males. Despite this, infected males cannot reproduce with uninfected females. Therefore, over time, a population exposed to <b>Wolbachia</b> [...] transitions from a few infected individuals to all individuals becoming infected, as the males that cannot reproduce successfully do not contribute to future generations. [...] This is called population replacement, where the population’s overall genotype is replaced by a new genotype. This shows how populations of Asian tiger mosquitoes can vary in number of Wolbachia-infected individuals, based on how often the infection is transmitted. Due to Wolbachia's ability to transmit from one host to the next, it can change the average genotype of a population, potentially reducing the population's gene flow with other nearby populations.|$|E
2500|$|Although the <b>Wolbachia</b> {{infection}} is prevalent in arthropod species, especially the Asian tiger mosquito, it {{is a useful}} mechanism for inhibiting the spread of dengue. Ae. aegypti individuals, a close relative of Ae. albopictus, with an artificial <b>Wolbachia</b> infection, cannot transmit dengue, an infectious virus, but they can pass on the <b>Wolbachia</b> infection to other populations. This could lead to many more discoveries in disease control for Ae. albopictus and other mosquito species. In addition, due to the cytoplasmic incompatibility caused by <b>Wolbachia,</b> [...] the artificial infection of males {{can serve as a}} biological control as they are unable to reproduce successfully with uninfected females (unidirectional CI). When artificially infected males are unable to reproduce, the population size can be controlled, thereby reducing the transmission of the harmful disease of interest. Artificial infection of males is achieved by the removal of cytoplasm from infected oocytes, which is then transferred into embryos prior to the blastoderm stage.|$|E
2500|$|A few ants and {{bees are}} capable of {{producing}} diploid female offspring parthenogenetically. These include a honey bee subspecies from South Africa, Apis mellifera capensis, where [...] workers {{are capable of}} producing diploid eggs parthenogenetically, and replacing the queen if she dies; other examples include some species of small carpenter bee, (genus Ceratina). Many parasitic wasps {{are known to be}} parthenogenetic, sometimes due to infections by <b>Wolbachia.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Many {{instances}} of endosymbiosis are obligate; that is, either the endosymbiont or the host cannot survive without the other, {{such as the}} gutless marine worms of the genus Riftia, which get nutrition from their endosymbiotic bacteria. [...] The most common examples of obligate endosymbioses are mitochondria and chloroplasts. Some human parasites, e.g. Wuchereria bancrofti and Mansonella perstans, thrive in their intermediate insect hosts because of an obligate endosymbiosis with <b>Wolbachia</b> spp. They can both be eliminated from said hosts by treatments that target this bacterium. However, not all endosymbioses are obligate. [...] Also, some endosymbioses can be harmful to either of the organisms involved.|$|E
2500|$|However, also in 2007, Whitworth et al. {{reported}} that {{flies in the}} related family Calliphoridae could not be discriminated by barcoding. They investigated the performance of barcoding in the fly genus Protocalliphora, known to be infected with the endosymbiotic bacteria <b>Wolbachia.</b> Assignment of unknown individuals to species was impossible for 60% of the species, and if the technique had been applied, {{as in the previous}} study, to identify new species, it would have underestimated the species number in the genus by 75%. They attributed the failure of barcoding to the non-monophyly of many of the species at the mitochondrial level; in one case, individuals from four different species had identical barcodes. The authors went on to state: ...|$|E
2500|$|Long-term {{coevolution}} sometimes {{leads to}} a relatively stable relationship tending to commensalism or [...] mutualism, as, all else being equal, {{it is in the}} evolutionary interest of the parasite that its host thrives. A parasite may evolve to become less harmful for its host or a host may evolve to cope with the unavoidable presence of a parasite—to the point that the parasite's absence causes the host harm. For example, although animals infected with parasitic worms are often clearly harmed, and therefore parasitized, such infections may also reduce the prevalence and effects of [...] autoimmune disorders in animal hosts, including humans. In a more extreme example, some nematode worms cannot reproduce, or even survive, without infection by <b>Wolbachia</b> bacteria.|$|E
2500|$|Exceptions, where mtDNA fails {{as a test}} {{of species}} identity, can occur through {{occasional}} recombination (direct evidence for recombination in mtDNA is available in some bivalves such as Mytilus but it is suspected that it may be more widespread) and through occurrences of hybridization. Male-killing microorganisms, cytoplasmic incompatibility-inducing symbionts (e.g., <b>Wolbachia),</b> as well as heteroplasmy, where an individual carries two or more mtDNA sequences, may affect patterns of mtDNA diversity within species, although these do not necessarily result in bar-coding failure. Occasional horizontal gene transfer (such as via cellular symbionts), or other [...] "reticulate" [...] evolutionary phenomena in a lineage can lead to misleading results (i.e., it is possible for two different species to share mtDNA). In particular, mtDNA seems to be particularly prone to interspecific introgression [...] probably due to difference between sexes in mate-choice and dispersal. Additionally, some species may carry divergent mtDNA lineages segregating within populations, often due to historical geographic structure, where these divergent lineages do not reflect species boundaries.|$|E
2500|$|DNA barcoding has {{met with}} {{spirited}} reaction from scientists, especially systematists, ranging from enthusiastic endorsement to vociferous opposition. [...] For example, many stress the fact that DNA barcoding does not provide reliable information above the species level, while others indicate that it is inapplicable at the species level, but may still have merit for higher-level groups. Others resent {{what they see as}} a gross oversimplification of the science of taxonomy. And, more practically, some suggest that recently diverged species might not be distinguishable on the basis of their COI sequences. Due to various phenomena, Funk & Omland (2003) found that some 23% of animal species are polyphyletic if their mtDNA data are accurate, indicating that using an mtDNA barcode to assign a species name to an animal will be ambiguous or erroneous some 23% of the time (see also Meyer & Paulay, 2005). Studies with insects suggest an equal or even greater error rate, due to the frequent lack of correlation between the mitochondrial genome and the nuclear genome or the lack of a barcoding gap (e.g., Hurst and Jiggins, 2005, Whitworth et al., 2007, Wiemers & Fiedler, 2007). Problems with mtDNA arising from male-killing microorganisms and cytoplasmic incompatibility-inducing symbionts (e.g., <b>Wolbachia)</b> are also particularly common among insects. Given that insects represent over 75% of all known organisms, this suggests that while mtDNA barcoding may work for vertebrates, it may not be effective for the majority of known organisms.|$|E
50|$|Drosophila simulans {{has also}} played an {{important}} role in sequencing the genomes for certain <b>Wolbachia</b> strains. D. simulans eggs were infected with the wRi <b>Wolbachia</b> strain in order to better understand how <b>Wolbachia</b> recombines. Further studies can help understand how <b>Wolbachia</b> strains coexist with D. simulans individuals. Studying <b>Wolbachia</b> strains and their mechanisms of infection can provide insight into the complex phylogenetic relationships of arthropods.|$|E
50|$|Some <b>Wolbachia</b> {{species that}} infect {{arthropods}} also provide some metabolic provisioning to their hosts. In Drosophila melanogaster, <b>Wolbachia</b> {{is found to}} mediate iron metabolism under nutritional stress and in Cimex lectularis, <b>Wolbachia</b> strain cCle helps the host to synthesize B vitamins.|$|E
50|$|<b>Wolbachia</b> {{influences}} the gender determination of its hosts, making females {{more common than}} males. In populations affected by <b>Wolbachia,</b> females commonly compete {{for the right to}} mate with males. This is one {{of the ways in which}} <b>Wolbachia</b> infections can lead to speciation, because females evolve traits that allow them to better compete for males. In extreme cases, the feminizing effect of <b>Wolbachia</b> can cause the host species to lose the chromosome responsible for female gender. <b>Wolbachia</b> infections are capable of causing the extinction of hosts by making females much more common than males.|$|E
50|$|Outside of insects, <b>Wolbachia</b> infects {{a variety}} of isopod species, spiders, mites, and many species of filarial {{nematodes}} (a type of parasitic worm), including those causing onchocerciasis (river blindness) and elephantiasis in humans, as well as heartworms in dogs. Not only are these disease-causing filarial worms infected with <b>Wolbachia,</b> but <b>Wolbachia</b> also seems to play an inordinate role in these diseases. A {{large part of the}} pathogenicity of filarial nematodes is due to host immune response toward their <b>Wolbachia.</b> Elimination of <b>Wolbachia</b> from filarial nematodes generally results in either death or sterility of the nematode. Consequently, current strategies for control of filarial nematode diseases include elimination of their symbiotic <b>Wolbachia</b> via the simple doxycycline antibiotic, rather than directly killing the nematode with far more toxic antinematode medications.|$|E
50|$|CI {{occurs when}} a <b>Wolbachia</b> {{infected}} male mates with a female that is infected by another <b>Wolbachia</b> strain (bidirectional CI) or is uninfected (unidirectional CI). Any other combination of un-/infected male/female crosses are compatible. An infected female is compatible with any infected or uninfected male of the same <b>Wolbachia</b> strain. On the other hand an uninfected female is only compatible with an uninfected male. In other words, if the male is infected by a CI-inducing strain of <b>Wolbachia</b> that is non-existent in its mate, it is an incompatible cross. Hosts can be cured from <b>Wolbachia</b> infection by antibiotic use.|$|E
5000|$|Although <b>Wolbachia</b> {{bacteria}} do {{not benefit}} their hosts in any way, they are maintained {{in the population}} because infected mothers pass them to their offspring through the ovum. Over time, bacterial presence in a population can lead to complete reproductive isolation of that population from uninfected populations. [...] <b>Wolbachia</b> causes speciation through reproductive isolation. Some hosts evolve with a dependency on <b>Wolbachia</b> for reproductive functions, so that individuals without <b>Wolbachia</b> infections have lower reproductive fitness.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to inhibiting the dengue virus (DENV) in some species of genus Aedes, <b>Wolbachia</b> {{has been identified}} to inhibit replication of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in A. aegypti. The Wmel strain of <b>Wolbachia</b> pipientis significantly reduced infection and dissemination rates of CHIKV in mosquitoes, compared to <b>Wolbachia</b> uninfected controls and the same phenomenon was observed in yellow fever virus infection converting this bacterium in an excellent promise for YFV and CHIKV suppression. Another study tested the effect of <b>Wolbachia</b> on the replication of West Nile virus (WNV), but in cell line Aag2 derived from A. aegypti cells, suggesting that despite {{the existence of an}} enhancement of viral genomic RNA replication in the cell line <b>Wolbachia</b> infected, the production of secreted virus was significantly inhibited. Also, the antiviral effect in intrathoracically infected mosquitoes depends on the strain of <b>Wolbachia,</b> and the replication of the virus in orally fed mosquitoes was completely inhibited in wMelPop strain of <b>Wolbachia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Two {{separate}} <b>Wolbachia</b> infection {{events have}} occurred in the ancestors of D. simulans, suggesting the evolutionary advantage of <b>Wolbachia</b> infections to D. simulans.|$|E
50|$|Attempts {{are ongoing}} to infect the {{mosquito}} population with bacteria of the <b>Wolbachia</b> genus, {{which makes the}} mosquitoes partially resistant to dengue virus. While artificially induced infections with <b>Wolbachia</b> is effective, it is unclear if naturally acquired infections are protective. Working is still ongoing as of 2015 {{to determine the best}} type of <b>Wolbachia</b> to use.|$|E
