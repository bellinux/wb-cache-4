5|$|The CFL re-gained {{relative}} {{stability in the}} 2000s, mostly thanks to enforcement of a salary cap, stricter standards of ownership, and increasingly lucrative television contracts negotiated with Canadian networks. The league has remained solely focused on its Canadian operations, with expansion efforts focused on returning a stable team to Ottawa. The first attempt at a replacement for the Rough Riders, the Ottawa Renegades, played from 2002 to 2005; in its last season, despite league resistance but without any other buyers, the Gliebermans purchased the franchise, then gave {{it back to the}} league, which suspended it prior to the 2006 season. After an extended delay due to stadium problems in Ottawa, the Ottawa Redblacks, <b>who</b> <b>own</b> the Rough Riders' history and trademarks, launched in 2014 and have so far been a success under the ownership of Jeff Hunt's consortium. Further expansion has been limited to one-off games such as Touchdown Atlantic and Northern Kickoff in more distant Canadian markets.|$|E
