40|$|This paper {{provides}} a novel {{rationale for the}} use of discretion in bank loan contracts. Discretion allows banks which produce information on borrowers to optimally adapt contract terms to “soft” or non-verifiable information in the course of lending. This facilitates investment efficiency and also allows for <b>wealth</b> <b>redistributions</b> in favor of firms with good investment opportunities. I show that the optimality of discretion depends critically on bank quality and the degree of lender competition. If bank quality is low and/or lender competition is limited, enforceable bank contracts and financial market contracts dominate discretionary contracts. I also show that the relative importance of bank vis-à-vis financial market financing is non-monotonic in borrower quality. The analysis has implications for the competitive position and the optimal organizational structure of banks, and emphasizes the value of relationship lending in an increasingly competitive environment. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of strategic behavior is often {{believed to be}} sufficient to negate the neutrality assertions of the Ricardian Equivalence Theorem.

The parent behaves strategically as he seeks to minimize this manip-ulation. I show that, for general utility functions, this form of strategic behavior does not alter the effects of a change in the timing and incidence of a lump-sum tax. The intuition for this result derives from the fact that the child's utility is a public good.

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the paradox of}} increased homicides in Venezuela {{in a period of}} <b>wealth</b> and <b>redistribution.</b> To do so, theories that explain criminality through poverty and inequality are reviewed and refuted and weighed against theories of institutionalism. Thus, the article analyses the situation of homicides between 1985 and 2010 and establishes three periods in which the rules regulating access to a) goods, b) political power, and c) social and penal control were broken. The theories are discussed with statistical information and interpreted within the economic and political context of the time. It is concluded that the reduction in homicides requires institutionalism based on sensitivity and certain formal and informal rules that allow the construction of legitimacy around social difference and punishment, and a citizens’ culture that favours social control by peers over penal control by the State. ...|$|R

Also {{available by}} subscription via World Wide Webxi, 158 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmWe first clarify {{that changes in}} fundamental paper <b>wealth</b> are <b>wealth</b> <b>redistributions</b> between current and future asset owners; and increases in fundamental paper wealth tend to make current consumers wealthier and hence have positive impacts on current aggregate consumption. Based {{on the concept of}} fundamental paper wealth, we examine three issues related to asset prices. The first issue is related to the wealth effect of monetary policy. While the wealth and Tobin's q effects are usually treated as two independent monetary policy transmission mechanisms, we show that they are indeed negatively correlated under a general-equilibrium perspective; and their magnitudes depend upon investment elasticity. These insights provide a new perspective to the relationship between asset prices and monetary policy. Another issue is related to the capital account policy of developing countries. Empirical evidence shows that capital inflows are often used by developing countries to finance excessive consumption. While the existing literature generally explains these phenomena as resulting from institutional imperfections, we show that they can be the results of fundamental paper wealth effect caused by capital inflows. We show that, while risk aversion causes low investment elasticity and hence reduces the total benefit of capital account liberalization for society over time, it nevertheless tends to make current consumers better off and drive consumption booms. We show that a positive yet uncertain future productivity shock is likely to cause consumption booms because of sluggish investment reactions. The third issue is related to the "asset market meltdown hypothesis", which predicts that baby boomers' prime-time savings will drive up asset prices that will eventually collapse due to their retirement dissavings. While the existing literature generally supports the hypothesis, we find that the meltdown is actually state-contingent and may not necessarily happen because the large capital stock built up by baby boomers' large savings may be able to sustain the asset prices during baby boomers' retirement era. However, we find that, in the case where the meltdown is about to happen, baby boomers as a whole has no escape; and their attempts to escape could push the economy into a liquidity trap...|$|R

50|$|The pre-dominating {{economic}} {{perspective is}} that economic bubbles {{result in a}} temporary boost in <b>wealth</b> and a <b>redistribution</b> of <b>wealth.</b> When prices increase, {{there is a positive}} wealth effect (property owners feel richer and spend more), and when they decline, there is a negative wealth effect (property owners feel poorer and spend less).

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{estimate}} the Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System of non-durable goods on the Czech Republic Household Budget Survey data in two distinct models. Respective income, own and cross price elasticities are calculated and we interpret the resulting income, price and {{demographic characteristics of the}} household demand. The first model is used to estimate the effects of the 2015 Value Added Tax reform in the Czech Republic, which introduced 10 % reduced rate on medication and books. We estimate how much the reform changes the consumption behaviour of households, the biggest changes are in the commodities of clothing, books, medications and household goods. The households are estimated to spend 1, 049 billion CZK more on non-durable goods and the VAT revenue is estimated to decrease by 818 million CZK. The second model is used to predict the effects of the population ageing on the household demand. We do this in four scenarios to separate effects of the household composition change and to analyse the composed effects of increasing <b>wealth</b> and <b>redistribution</b> among the working and retired households. The population ageing has the highest impact on the commodities of food, fuel and light, transport and leisure services.
