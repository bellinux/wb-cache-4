5|$|After {{two weeks}} in Haiko, {{the family moved to}} a rented house in Porvoo where, in August 1917, Victoria gave birth to Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich of Russia, her only son and the heir to the dynasty. The family {{remained}} in Finland, a former Grand Duchy under Russian rule, which had declared its independence in December 1917. They hoped that the White Russians <b>would</b> <b>prevail.</b> They gradually ran out of supplies and had to beg for help from family. In July 1918, Victoria wrote to her first cousin, Crown Princess Margaret of Sweden, begging her to send baby food so she could feed Vladimir. She was alienated from England because she felt her English relatives had not done enough to help the Romanovs.|$|E
5|$|The Heat {{repeated}} as champions in 2013, {{this time}} over the San Antonio Spurs, with the finals being the first since 1987 to feature four former Finals MVPs in a Finals; with Tim Duncan (1999, 2003, 2005) and Tony Parker (2007) for the Spurs, and Wade (2006) and James (2012) for the Heat. The Spurs were up 3–2 in the series going into Game 6 in Miami. With seconds remaining in regulation, Ray Allen scored a game-tying three-pointer to send the game into overtime, and the Heat <b>would</b> <b>prevail</b> 103–100. The game is considered by some to {{have been one of}} the greatest playoff games in NBA history. The Heat would win Game 7, 95–88, to clinch the title. James was again named the Finals MVP for the second straight year.|$|E

5|$|D'Eyncourt, who had {{departed}} Brazil in October {{immediately after the}} contract was signed, returned in March 1911 to display the various design options available to the Brazilian Navy. Armstrong evidently thought the second faction <b>would</b> <b>prevail,</b> so he also took with him everything needed to close a deal on Bacellar's design. By mid-March, Armstrong's contacts in Brazil reported that Leão had convinced the recently elected President Hermes Rodrigues da Fonseca to cancel the design with twelve 14-inch guns {{in favor of a}} smaller ship. The credit may not have laid with Leão alone, though; da Fonseca was already dealing with multiple issues. Most importantly, he {{had to deal with the}} fallout from a large naval revolt in November 1910 (the Revolt of the Lash), which had seen three of the new vessels just purchased by the navy, along with one older coast-defense ship, mutiny against the use of corporal punishment in the navy.|$|E
5|$|John succeeded Richard as king in 1199, but {{his rule}} proved unpopular {{with many of}} his barons, who in {{response}} moved against him. In 1214, while the king was at Windsor Castle, Robert Fitzwalter led an army into London and laid siege to the Tower. Although under-garrisoned, the Tower resisted and the siege was lifted once John signed the Magna Carta. The king reneged on his promises of reform, leading to {{the outbreak of the}} First Barons' War. Even after the Magna Carta was signed, Fitzwalter maintained his control of London. During the war, the Tower's garrison joined forces with the barons. John was deposed in 1216 and the barons offered the English throne to Prince Louis, the eldest son of the French king. However, after John's death in October 1216, many began to support the claim of his eldest son, Prince Henry. War continued between the factions supporting Louis and Henry, with Fitzwalter supporting Louis. Fitzwalter was still in control of London and the Tower, both of which held out until it was clear that Henry's supporters <b>would</b> <b>prevail.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1873 {{the idea}} was resurrected– again by Palmer, who was now Lord Selborne and the new Lord Chancellor– as the Supreme Court of Judicature bill. While still cautious, Selborne's bill was far more {{structured}} than Hatherley's, and contained more detail on {{what was to be}} done. Rather than fusing the common law and equity, which he saw as impracticable since it would destroy the idea of trusts, he decided to fuse the courts and the procedure. The final draft provided that all of the existing superior courts would be fused into one court consisting of two levels; one of first instance, one appellate. The court of first instance, {{to be known as the}} High Court of Justice, would be subdivided into several divisions based on the old superior courts, one of which, the Chancery Division, would deal with equity cases. All jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery was to be transferred to the Chancery Division; Section 25 of the Act provided that, where there was conflict between the common law and equity, the latter <b>would</b> <b>prevail.</b> An appeal from each division went to the appellate level, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales. These provisions were brought into effect after amendment with the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1875, and the Court of Chancery ceased to exist. The Master of the Rolls was transferred to the new Court of Appeal, the Lord Chancellor retained his other judicial and political roles, and the position of Vice-Chancellor ceased to exist, replaced by ordinary judges. The Chancery Division remains to this day part of the High Court of Justice of England and Wales.|$|E

25|$|There {{was already}} at that time a school of thought that stated that liberty and {{equality}} can quickly become contradictory: indeed liberty doesn't solve social inequalities since there exist some natural inequalities (of talent, intelligence, etc.). That school of thought considered {{that the government had}} only to protect liberty and to only proclaim natural equality, and eventually liberty <b>would</b> <b>prevail</b> over social equality since all people have different talents and abilities and are free to exercise them.|$|E
25|$|The party's theory {{made the}} working class the {{politically}} decisive class: thus if {{the working class}} supported fascism then fascism <b>would</b> <b>prevail.</b> Answers to letters in the Socialist Standard in the 1930s repeatedly made this point. Early writers noted what Benito Mussolini {{was able to do}} with {{the power of the state}} on his side, a part of a vindication of the SPGB's approach of the workers seizing control of the state. The SPGB, hence, declined to join anti-fascist fronts or to make a particular issue of anti-fascism, arguing that the pro-socialist case was the necessary remedy for fascism.|$|E

25|$|It is {{generally}} {{thought that the}} two subspecies of Orthalicus reses do not interbreed due to anatomical incompatibility. However, Emmel and Perry (2004) recommended that if the two Orthalicus reses subspecies prove to be as genetically invariant as was observed in their study, the groups {{should be considered a}} single taxon or taxonomic unit. In that case, the nominate form, Orthalicus reses reses, <b>would</b> <b>prevail,</b> and Orthalicus reses nesodryas would be demoted to a synonym instead of a valid subspecies. Emmel and Perry (2004) however asserted that the taxa “should continue to be considered as independent units for management purposes”.|$|E

CollegeSoccerNews.com described the match as a likely cagey contest featuring two very evenly matched teams. Brian Radewitz at Hero Sports predicted that the match would be tightly contested, but that Stanford <b>would</b> <b>prevail.</b> Radewitz felt that Stanford would have an edge over Wake Forest, given their experience in the tournament, as well as the team's sturdy defense.|$|E

Industry would be kept separate from residential areas—such zoning was a new idea at the time—and trees and open spaces <b>would</b> <b>prevail</b> everywhere.

Ten plays later, Ryan Mallett rushed for a four-yard touchdown to make it 34-3 Hogs. Tate would reply twice, first on a one-yard touchdown run, and later on a 60-yard touchdown scamper. Onterio McCalebb would also score {{on the ground for}} Auburn in the third quarter, cutting the Razorbacks' lead to 23-34. Broderick Green responded early in the fourth quarter on a 3-yard rushing score. Alex Tejada would add a field goal to produce the final 44-23 margin. Arkansas won by 21 points, totally reversing Tommy Tuberville's prediction that the Tigers <b>would</b> <b>prevail</b> by three scores.|$|E
