5|$|In July 2013, Hudner visited Pyongyang in {{an attempt}} to recover Brown's remains from the crash site. He was told by North Korean {{authorities}} to return in September <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>is</b> more predictable.|$|E
5|$|I {{spend my}} time out in the open, on the shingle beach <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>is</b> bad or the fishing boats go out, or I go into the {{countryside}} which is very beautiful here, that I find perhaps still more charming in winter than in summer and, naturally I work all the time, and I believe that this year I {{am going to do}} some serious things.|$|E
5|$|In {{traditional}} tales {{the blue}} men {{have the power}} to create severe storms, but <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>is</b> fine they sleep or float just under the surface of the water. They swim with their torso from the waist upwards raised out of the sea, twisting and diving in a similar way to a porpoise. To amuse themselves the creatures play shinty when the skies are clear and bright at night. They are able to speak and converse with mariners and are especially vocal when soaking vessels with water spray, roaring with laughter as vessels capsize.|$|E
50|$|Ancient shepherds {{used to have}} {{reversible}} garments with a warm {{side that}} they would wear <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>was</b> cold, and a cool side <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>was</b> hot.|$|R
50|$|<b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>was</b> bad and <b>the</b> pastor {{could not}} come from Lavik, Edvard Liljedahl spoke from his front porch to the congregation.|$|R
5000|$|<b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>was</b> temperate, Mayan {{clothing}} was needed less as {{protection from the}} elements and more for personal adornment. Maya clerics and other dignitaries wore elaborate outfits with jewellery.|$|R
5|$|Apart {{from their}} blue colour, the mythical creatures {{look much like}} humans, and {{are about the same}} size. They have the power to create storms, but <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>is</b> fine they float {{sleeping}} on or just {{below the surface of the}} water. The blue men swim with their torsos raised out of the sea, twisting and diving as porpoises do. They are able to speak, and when a group approaches a ship its chief may shout two lines of poetry to the master of the vessel and challenge him to complete the verse. If the skipper fails in that task then the blue men will attempt to overturn the ship and capsize it.|$|E
5|$|On 7 June 2015 the World Championships {{were moved}} to their new home, one of the cycle track bridges over the river Windrush in Langel Common, near to the Cogges Manor Farm Museum in Witney, Oxfordshire. The new {{location}} still retains a rural atmosphere while being {{only a few minutes}} walk from Witney town centre with its convenient public transport links to Oxford. Car Parking is also much closer than at the original venue, which was a factor that influenced the choice of venue. As this was the first year at the new location, the organizers decided not to hold the 2015 team games.. However, the team games were restored in 2016. The move to the new venue has also allowed the event to move to June <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>is</b> likely to be better.|$|E
5|$|Ale can be {{defeated}} by zmajeviti men, {{who have a}} human mother, but a dragon father. They look like ordinary people except for little wings beneath their armpits; such men are always born at night after a twelve-month term. Much like a zduhać, a zmajeviti man lives like everybody else <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>is</b> nice, but when an ala leads threatening clouds into sight, he falls into a trance and his spirit {{comes out of his}} body and flies up to the clouds to fight with the ala, just like a dragon would do. A story from Banat, which was held as true until the 1950s, says that before World War I, an exhausted ala {{in the form of a}} giant snake fell from the clouds onto a road. The explanation of the event was that the ala was defeated in her fight with a zmajeviti man; people gave her milk to help her recover.|$|E
6000|$|... "We can do {{very well}} without him," [...] growled my father. [...] "He sheered off from us <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>was</b> foul, {{and we have no}} need of him now that the sun is shining." ...|$|R
50|$|In March 2013, race {{promoter}} Hindery Jr. {{said that}} the American Grand Prix was back on track and that critical pavement work would start around September <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>was</b> most conducive to do such work.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{that looks}} like the {{smokestack}} of the houseboat!" [...] cried Tom. He meant the stack to the chimney, for several rooms of the houseboat were furnished with stoves, to <b>be</b> used <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>was</b> chilly.|$|R
5|$|Cultural {{attitudes towards}} rain differ across the world. In {{temperate}} climates, {{people tend to}} be more stressed <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>is</b> unstable or cloudy, with its impact greater on men than women. Rain can also bring joy, as some consider it to be soothing or enjoy the aesthetic appeal of it. In dry places, such as India, or during periods of drought, rain lifts people's moods. In Botswana, the Setswana word for rain, pula, is used as the name of the national currency, in recognition of the economic importance of rain in its country, since it has a desert climate. Several cultures have developed means of dealing with rain and have developed numerous protection devices such as umbrellas and raincoats, and diversion devices such as gutters and storm drains that lead rains to sewers. Many people find the scent during and immediately after rain pleasant or distinctive. The source of this scent is petrichor, an oil produced by plants, then absorbed by rocks and soil, and later released into the air during rainfall.|$|E
5|$|Most ants are univoltine, {{producing}} {{a new generation}} each year. During the species-specific breeding period, new reproductives, females, and winged males leave the colony in {{what is called a}} nuptial flight. The nuptial flight usually takes place in the late spring or early summer <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>is</b> hot and humid. Heat makes flying easier and freshly fallen rain makes the ground softer for mated queens to dig nests. Males typically take flight before the females. Males then use visual cues to find a common mating ground, for example, a landmark such as a pine tree to which other males in the area converge. Males secrete a mating pheromone that females follow. Males will mount females in the air, but the actual mating process usually takes place on the ground. Females of some species mate with just one male but in others they may mate with as many as ten or more different males, storing the sperm in their spermathecae.|$|E
25|$|During months <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>is</b> warmer, {{the smooth}} green snake tends to be active both day and night; while in the colder winter months, it hibernates in groups. Ant hills and rodent burrows are used during {{hibernation}} as part-time homes.|$|E
6000|$|... "So he was, {{but then}} they always had a great affection for him, {{although}} he had so many eccentricities. You remember that <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> least cold, {{he would try to}} come into the house." ...|$|R
6000|$|One day to this spot, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>was</b> hot, [...] Came Matilda Hortense Fortescue; [...] And {{beside her}} {{there came a}} youth of high name,-- [...] Augustus Florell Montague: [...] The two [...] Both loved that wild, foreign Emeu.|$|R
60|$|Algernon. But why {{on earth}} did you break it off? What had I done? I had done nothing at all. Cecily, I am very much hurt indeed to hear you broke it off. Particularly <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>was</b> so charming.|$|R
25|$|Passenger trains {{normally}} {{run from}} Llanberis to the Summit. The wind speed is measured at Clogwyn Station {{and used to}} determine if trains can continue to the summit. Trains terminate at Rocky Valley Halt <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>is</b> too bad {{to allow them to}} proceed safely to the summit.|$|E
25|$|Visits to Flores are {{considered}} ideal in spring (around June) or early summer (around July) <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>is</b> good and vegetation is green and flowers bloom. The nearest airport to the islet is Flores Airport in Santa Cruz das Flores, {{located on the}} other side of the island. Locally, the islet is only accessible by boat.|$|E
25|$|Celebrations {{often take}} place not on May 1 {{but during the}} Victoria Day long weekend, later in the month and <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>is</b> likely to be better. The longest {{continually}} observed May Day in the British Commonwealth is held {{in the city of}} New Westminster, BC. There, the first May Day celebration was held on May 4, 1870.|$|E
60|$|One night, {{at the end}} of August, when Bathsheba's {{experiences}} as a married woman were still new, and <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>was</b> yet dry and sultry, a man stood motionless in the stockyard of Weatherbury Upper Farm, looking at the moon and sky.|$|R
50|$|Saint Leonard {{also has}} many outdoor hockey rinks in the winter. There are seven rinks set up before winter, {{and then they}} are iced <b>when</b> <b>the</b> {{temperature}} is appropriate. There was a delay of rink making in 2007 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>was</b> warmer than usual.|$|R
2500|$|The International Basketball Federation, and IOC {{which is}} the {{governing}} body of international basketball, used the 1936 tournament to experiment with outdoor basketball. [...] Lawn tennis courts {{were used for the}} competition. [...] This caused problems <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>was</b> adverse, especially during the final game.|$|R
25|$|Trains {{depart from}} Llanberis station at regular intervals, up to every {{30 minutes at}} busy times, {{although}} trains are only run if a minimum number of tickets have been sold. During the summer <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>is</b> favourable, most trains are sold out. Passengers {{are not allowed to}} leave or join trains at Halfway or Hebron, but they may join down trains at Clogwyn Station if there is space.|$|E
25|$|Generally, wasps {{are unable}} to predict heavy rainfalls. They {{continue}} their foraging activities even in the rain, but cease when the rain becomes torrential. When the rainfall becomes extremely heavy near the nesting site, the workers rapidly return to their nests. Those whose foraging activities were interrupted by heavy rainfall become reluctant to forage again in the future even <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>is</b> dry and calm. Those who continue to forage do so mainly for fluid.|$|E
25|$|The ideal Stirling {{cycle is}} {{unattainable}} {{in the real}} world (as with any heat engine); efficiencies of 50% have been reached, similar to the maximum figure for Diesel cycle engines. The efficiency of Stirling machines is also linked to the environmental temperature; higher efficiency is obtained <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>is</b> cooler, thus making this type of engine less interesting in places with warmer climates. As with other external combustion engines, Stirling engines can use heat sources other than from combustion of fuels.|$|E
50|$|The System was {{designed}} to mechanically place the explosive primer which ignites the black powder of the rifle. This feature was to be used when {{a high rate of}} fire <b>was</b> needed, or <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>was</b> too cold to manually place individual primers on the firearm.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, the Assyrians of Jilu {{celebrate}} the Feast (Syriac: Shahrā) of St. Zay'ā on September 13 {{every year on}} the Feast of the Cross. The reason given {{for this is that}} the Saint’s other festivals fell on dates <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>was</b> too cold for pilgrims to be able to travel to the main shrine for the celebration. Often, the Jilu District was snowed in for six months of the year. Holding the Saint’s Feast day on September 13, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>was</b> more agreeable, not only meant that they could take advantage of the brighter light of moon at night, it also meant that those Jīlū men who planned on travelling before the first snows could pray for a safe and successful journey and make their vows to the Saint before departing.|$|R
2500|$|In {{a season}} <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>was</b> kinder than {{it often is}} in England, New Zealand's cricketers emerged with a record {{similar to that of}} the earlier tours in 1927 and 1931, with a pretty even balance of wins and losses, except that more matches came to a {{definite}} conclusion.|$|R
25|$|The flies {{also cause}} a huge {{economic}} problem in Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. In these areas sun-drying {{is the major}} method of preserving fish, as ice is typically unaffordable. However, blowfly larvae tend to infect these sun-dried fish <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>is</b> warm and humid. In an experiment, 95% of the infecting flies {{were found to be}} C. megacephala. The flies can be controlled by using an odor that the flies are attracted to trap them. Insecticides are also used, although this results in the development of resistance.|$|E
25|$|The virus circulates between ticks and rodents, {{with humans}} being the {{secondary}} hosts. People {{at risk for}} catching the disease are hikers and campers {{that are in the}} risk areas. Also, April, May, and June are when the infections mainly occur, because this is the time when the adult ticks are prevalent in the environment. Unfortunately, this is also <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>is</b> pleasant for hiking and camping. The best way to avoid getting bitten and catching this disease is wearing long sleeves or pants, avoiding high tick-infested areas, and wearing tick repellent.|$|E
25|$|Hesselberg (689m {{above sea}} level) {{is the highest}} point in Middle Franconia and the Franconian Jura and is {{situated}} 60km south west of Nuremberg, Germany. The mountain stands isolated and far {{from the center of}} the Franconian Jura, in its southwestern border region, 4km to the north west of Wassertrüdingen. The mountain's first recorded name was Öselberg, which probably derived from öder Berg (bleak mountain). This name later changed to Eselsberg and finally to the current name Hesselberg. As a butte the mountain provides an insight into Jurassic geology. It has also witnessed an eventful history, many incidents were handed down from generation to generation and these mixed with facts have become legends. Nowadays many people visit Hesselberg in order to enjoy nature and the wonderful vista. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>is</b> clear the Alps 150km away can be seen.|$|E
50|$|This was {{the first}} time ever that two games were played on the same weekend. This was brought in after the request from some teams, who complained that they had to always play early on in <b>the</b> year <b>when</b> bad <b>weather</b> prevailed, but others played in March, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>was</b> better.|$|R
5000|$|The 2006 Russia-Georgia {{energy crisis}} {{describes}} an international incident triggered by two explosions on the Mozdok-Tbilisi natural gas pipeline in North Ossetia on January 22, 2006. The explosions suspended gas supply to Georgia {{at a time}} <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>was</b> particularly cold, leading to allegations of deliberate energy blackmail {{carried out by the}} Russian government.|$|R
25|$|In {{the ensuing}} Battle of Jean-Rabel, Thunder and Valiant fired on Harmonie {{on the evening}} of 16 April, but with little effect. They {{returned}} <b>the</b> next day <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>was</b> calmer. Knowing that Harmonie could not escape, her officers drove her aground and set her on fire; eventually her powder magazine exploded, destroying her completely.|$|R
