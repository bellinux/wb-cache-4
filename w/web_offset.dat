Early stamp images were almost always produced from engravings — a design etched into a steel die, which was then hardened and whose impression was transferred to a printing plate. Using an engraved image was deemed a more secure way of printing stamps as it was nearly impossible to counterfeit a finely detailed image with raised lines unless you were a master engraver. In the mid-20th century, stamp issues produced by other forms of printing began to emerge, such as [...] lithography, photogravure, intaglio and <b>web</b> <b>offset</b> printing. These later printing methods were less expensive and typically produced images of lesser quality.|$|E

5000|$|The {{boom in the}} {{underground}} press was made practical by the availability of cheap offset printing, which {{made it possible to}} print a few thousand copies of a small tabloid paper for a couple of hundred dollars, which a sympathetic printer might extend on credit. Paper was cheap, and many printing firms around the country had over-expanded during the 1950s and had excess capacity on their <b>offset</b> <b>web</b> presses, which could be negotiated for at bargain rates. [...] Most papers operated on a shoestring budget, pasting up camera-ready copy on layout sheets on the editor's kitchen table, with labor performed by unpaid, non-union volunteers. Typesetting costs, which at the time were wiping out many established big city papers, were avoided by typing up copy on a rented or borrowed IBM Selectric typewriter to be pasted up by hand.

The page makeup was still hot metal as before. But each page was now pulled on a hand operated proof press. The photo areas were masked out with black paper and this was photographed on a large Litho camera to produce a tabloid size page negative for each page. The photos were processed separately and pasted into the [...] "windows" [...] produced by the black rectangles on the proof pages. These page negatives were then burned in pairs onto hand sensitized aluminum plates with an arc exposure unit and hand developed and mounted on the offset press units. A typical press run for the 14,000 or so copies printed was 40 minutes. For many years it continued in this hybrid mode using a backshop staffed by trained journalism students working as paid student labor {{under the direction of}} a professional backshop supervisor and offset pressmen. As a tabloid the six units could print 48 tabloid pages which was almost more than its quarter folder could handle. Typically this press ran 12 to 32 tabloid pages daily, 16 pages or 24 pages being favored sizes, a much more comfortable size for the folder. It could register and print full page process color with high quality and did on occasion, using the two stacked units.

A parametric study was then undertaken to investigate both the effect of the position of holes in the web and the cross-section sizes on the web crippling strength of the channel sections.

40|$|A {{numerical}} procedure for multi-disciplinary optimization of railway wheels, based on Design of Experiments (DOE) methodology and automated design, is presented. The target is a wheel design {{that meets the}} requirements for fatigue strength, while minimizing the unsprung mass and rolling noise. A 3 -level full factorial (3 LFF) DOE is used to collect data points required to set up Response Surface Models (RSM) relating design and response variables in the design space. Computationally efficient simulations are thereafter performed using the RSM to identify the solution that best fits the design target. A demonstration example, including four geometric design variables in a parametric finite element (FE) model, is presented. The design variables are wheel radius, <b>web</b> thickness, lateral <b>offset</b> between rim and hub, and radii at the transitions rim/web and hub/web, but more variables (including material properties) can be added if needed.

No one can argue that the concept of a solventless ink system is not timely; and it is certainly not new. In fact, it has its roots in the traditional mechanisms associated with the method by which a printed ink film is imnobil ized. These methods are: 1) Oxidation (chemical), 2) Penetration, 3) Solvent evaporation, and 4) Moisture setting (precipitation). There is no doubt then that a news ink is a solventless system since, it is a dispersion in essentially nonvolatile 1 iquid carriers that set by absorption into the pulpy news stocks, which function like a blotter. In the same sense, many traditional sheetfed inks are also solventless systems, being dispersions in nonvolatile oleoresinous vehicles. These cure in time by oxidation.
