So it’s kind of like, I’m telling my business. You know what I mean and I didn’t really want to. But it’s going to help when it comes to relationships like love and all of that because it’s like the sh*t really happens. The same way Steve Harvey did the book Act Like A Lady, Think Like A Man. So it’s like the album, like I messed up with my main chick, trying to get with the side-chick. Like she was out there, but I didn’t know. So now I’m learning and I {{have to go back and}} fix my relationship because the side-chick got me all tore up.

40|$|M. Ed. What the {{researcher}} will hope to discover during the research {{project is the}} importance of being a reflective teacher. The purpose of this research project is to investigate reflective teaching as an aspect of teacher competence. Through the literature survey {{the researcher}} hopes to derive a clearer meaning of the term reflective teaching. The central concept which will guide the researcher in his literature survey will be reflective teaching. At this stage in the research project the central concept would be defined as the ability of the teacher to critically analyze his own work which brings about a process of self awareness, self critique, social and institutional critique. Reflective teaching could be viewed from three dimensions. THE TECHNICAL DIMENSION: The efficiency and effectiveness of the means to attain ends. THE PRACTICAL DIMENSION: This is the teaching activity accessing the adequacy of educational goals. CRITICAL DIMENSION: Questioning which educational goals, <b>why</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> ? What do we hope to achieve ? It should be understood that this definition is not rigid and set, but rather it is tentative and evolving throughout the study, which will be based on information gathered in our literature review. The researcher will, also seek to understand why {{it is important to be}} a reflective teacher. The researcher will also seek to explore the circumstances which leads one to be a reflective teacher. Eventually the researcher will try to describe the experiences of being a reflective teacher...|$|E
