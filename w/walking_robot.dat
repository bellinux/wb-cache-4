2500|$|For {{nearly the}} whole of the 20th century, bipedal robots were very {{difficult}} to construct and robot locomotion involved only wheels, treads, or multiple legs. Recent cheap and compact computing power has made two-legged robots more feasible. Some notable biped robots are ASIMO, HUBO, MABEL and QRIO. [...] Recently, spurred by the success of creating a fully passive, un-powered bipedal <b>walking</b> <b>robot,</b> those working on such machines have begun using principles gleaned from the study of human and animal locomotion, which often relies on passive mechanisms to minimize power consumption.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{theme of}} <b>walking</b> <b>robots</b> {{stability}} is analyzed {{in the paper}} as a particular case of stability for dynamic systems that depend on parameters, deduced, in the mathematical model, by specifying the parameters, not specified numerically, that define the dynamic system. Another aspect of the walking robots’ stability assurance is the necessity of sequentially using parameter time, in evolving a dynamic system that permits the local constant selection of the dynamic system's remaining parameters, assuring its stable evolution. In opposition is the stability of rocket flight, which presupposes asymptotic stability. The optimization of the <b>walking</b> <b>robot's</b> dynamic system evolution is possible by identifying the mathematical conditions of separation between the stable and unstable zone {{in the range of}} free parameters, inspired from the mathematical conditions already analysed by us for the general case of the dynamic systems, in some of our previous papers. The theoretical considerations are exemplified on <b>walking</b> <b>robot's</b> mathematical model. The possible chaotic evolution of the dynamic systems, with possible application on <b>walking</b> <b>robots</b> evolution is also analysed...|$|R
50|$|LAURON is a six-legged <b>walking</b> <b>robot,</b> {{which is}} being {{developed}} at the Forschungszentrum Informatik Karlsruhe (FZI) in Germany.

In the year 1994, this robot was presented to public at the CeBIT in Hanover. This first LAURON generation was, in contrast to the current generation, controlled by an artificial neural network, hence the robot's German name: LAUfROboter Neuronal gesteuert (English: <b>Walking</b> <b>Robot,</b> Neural Controlled). The current generation LARUON V was finished in 2013.|$|E

50|$|Walking - The {{spectacle}} of a multi-legged <b>robot</b> <b>walking</b> across the arena into combat {{is a big}} audience favorite. Robot combat rules typically have given <b>walking</b> <b>robots</b> an additional weight allowance to offset their slower speed, {{the complexity of the}} mechanism, and to encourage their construction. What the event organizers had in mind was something like the spider-legged robot Mechadon, but what most often was produced were simple rule-shaving propulsion systems that attempted to save as much of the extra weight allowance as possible for additional weaponry. Attempts at more restrictive definitions of “Walking” have effectively eliminated <b>walking</b> <b>robots</b> from competition. BattleBots heavyweight champion Son of Whyachi used a controversial cam-driven “Shufflebot” propulsion system, which was promptly declared ineligible for additional weight allowance at subsequent competitions.|$|R
