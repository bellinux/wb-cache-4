5|$|Despite {{winning the}} Jack Adams Award as top coach and being {{popular with the}} Sabres fanbase, Nolan was only offered a one-year {{contract}} extension by replacement GM Darcy Regier. He rejected this under {{the grounds that it}} <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>short,</b> and decided to part ways with the franchise. This upset many fans, who blamed Nolan's departure on Hašek's alleged attempt to rid him.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} was assigned the airport's runway 22 for the takeoff, but used runway 26 instead. Runway 26 <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>short</b> {{for a safe}} takeoff, causing the aircraft to overrun {{the end of the}} runway before it could become airborne. It crashed just past the end of the runway, killing all 47 passengers and two of the three crew. The flight's first officer was the only survivor.|$|E
5|$|And Yet It Moves {{received}} generally favorable reviews. The PC version gained aggregate {{scores of}} 71.50% and 75 on GameRankings and Metacritic, respectively, while the WiiWare version gained aggregate scores of 85.30% and 83. Critics applauded the game's unique {{take on the}} platforming genre and the game's paper collage visual style, but felt the game <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>short.</b> Some critics noted {{the absence of any}} narrative or backstory, but felt that the game ultimately didn't need one, though GameSpot noted it as one of the game's weaknesses.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of this {{disaster}} King Rama I predicted that the Chakri dynasty would last only 150 years from its foundation. This prophecy was recorded in a diary of a princess of the first reign, after reading it many years later, King Rama V remarked that 150 years <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>short</b> and that the princess must have inadvertently dropped a nought. This prophecy was again present {{in the minds of many}} people, when only three months after the dynasty's 150th anniversary celebrations the Siamese revolution of 1932 was carried out. The revolution replaced the absolute monarchy of the Chakri monarchs with a constitutional monarchy with Siam's first constitution.|$|E
5|$|On release, {{the four}} reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly applauded Kirby's Block Ball for modifying the Breakout formula {{to create a}} new and enjoyable game. They {{especially}} praised the unique power-ups, though Crispin Boyer and Sushi X also felt the game <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>short</b> and easy. Nintendo Power said they enjoyed Block Ball and its number of stages, but wondered how its eight megabits of memory were being used. The magazine found the parts where Kirby eats the unbreakable blocks to be innovative. All six of the magazine's reviewers recommended the game.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the film}} had been {{released}} in Czechoslovakia, Forman sought an international distributor, who informed him that the film <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>short</b> for American audiences and that it didn't have enough nudity in it; so Forman was coerced into shooting some additional scenes that were never shown for domestic consumption. One of these scenes, which {{was included in the}} US version, involved a slapstick sequence in which Milda, the pianist, tries to pick up a buxom girl on the streets of Prague, only to have her trick him into entering the wrong bedroom of the four-story building in which she lives, disturbing the sleeping residents.|$|E

5|$|One of Shelby's chief {{concerns}} was securing {{federal aid}} {{to defend the}} frontier. Although Kentuckians were engaged in an undeclared war with American Indians north of the Ohio River, Shelby had been ordered by Secretary of War Henry Knox not to conduct offensive military actions against the Indians. Furthermore, he was limited by federal regulations that restricted the service of state militiamen to thirty days, which <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>short</b> to be effective. With the meager resources of his fledgling state he was only able to defend the most vulnerable areas from Indian attack. Meanwhile, Kentuckians suspected that the Indians were being stirred up and supplied by the British.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} content {{featured}} in the game received mixed reviews. Miller thought that the game only revolved around one idea, which led to its simplistic gameplay. Camron and Cooper thought that the campaign <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>short</b> for most players. Shoemaker thought that for a full-priced game, it lacked content. Reiner furthered criticized the game's low replay value. Carter advocated that players purchase the game when its price dropped. He added that while the game features lots of ideas, most of them failed to deliver.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, the Singapore {{strategy}} was revived {{in the form}} of Operation Mastodon, a plan to deploy V bombers of RAF Bomber Command equipped with nuclear weapons to Singapore as part of Britain's contribution to the defence of the region under Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO). Once again, there were formidable logistical problems. As the Vbombers could not fly all the way to Singapore, a new staging base was developed at RAF Gan in the Maldives. RAF Tengah's runway <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>short</b> for Vbombers, so RAF Butterworth had to be used until it could be lengthened. The basing of nuclear armed aircraft, and the stockpiling of nuclear weapons without consultation with the local authorities soon ran into political complications.|$|E

5|$|Maben was {{concerned}} {{that one of the}} problems with the film was that it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>short.</b> In early 1973, Maben was fly fishing with Waters, and suggested the possibility of improving the film by watching them at work in a recording studio. Subsequently, Maben was invited with a small crew using a single 35mm camera to Abbey Road Studios to film supposed recording sessions of The Dark Side of the Moon, as well as interviews conducted off-camera by Maben, and footage of the band eating and talking at the studio cafeteria. Maben was particularly happy about this footage, feeling it captured the spontaneous humour of the band. This version premiered on 21 August 1974, and ran for 80 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Moonraker is {{the third}} novel by the British author Ian Fleming to feature his fictional British Secret Service agent James Bond. It was {{published}} by Jonathan Cape on 5 April 1955 and featured a cover design conceived by Fleming. The plot is derived from a Fleming screenplay that <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>short</b> for a full novel so he added {{the passage of the}} bridge game between Bond and the industrialist Hugo Drax. In {{the latter half of the}} novel, Bond is seconded to Drax's staff as the businessman builds the Moonraker, a prototype missile designed to defend England. Unknown to Bond, Drax is German, an ex-Nazi now working for the Soviets; his plan is to build the rocket, arm it with a nuclear warhead, and fire it at London. Uniquely for a Bond novel, Moonraker is set entirely in Britain, which raised comments from some readers, complaining about the lack of exotic locations.|$|E
5|$|The Yer-2 {{was not in}} {{squadron}} service when Germany invaded on 22 June 1941, but the 420th and 421st Long-Range Bomber Regiments (—DBAP) {{were formed}} shortly afterwards. However neither regiment flew any operational missions until later in the summer. On the evening of 10 August Yer-2s of the 420th DBAP, accompanied by Petlyakov Pe-8s of the 432nd DBAP, attempted to bomb Berlin from Pushkino Airfield near Leningrad. The airfield <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>short</b> to accommodate a fully loaded Yer-2, but three bombers did manage to take off regardless. Two managed to bomb Berlin, or its outskirts, but only one successfully returned; the other was shot down by 'friendly' Polikarpov I-16s when it reentered Soviet airspace and the third aircraft went missing. Three crews from the 420th DBAP bombed Königsberg during the nights of 28–29 August and 30 August–1 September from Ramenskoye Airport, southeast of Moscow.|$|E

5|$|Such a large glider {{had never}} been {{constructed}} before by the British military, and to test the design, a half-scale prototype model was first designed; designated GAL. 50 it still required an Armstrong Whitworth Whitley medium bomber {{to act as a}} tug to get it airborne, and was first flown in September 1941. However, it only flew once; the test pilot approached the landing area too low, attempted to raise the flaps for extra glide, and instead crashed the prototype and wrecked it. However, the trial was considered to be a success and the first full-scale prototype model was finished at GAL's works in Hanworth, Middlesex in March 1942. The Hamilcar was transported to RAF Snaith in Yorkshire, as GAL's airfield at Hanworth <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>short</b> for the glider to take off from; moving the glider to a secure military airfield would also ensure that it remained secret. Its first flight was conducted on 27 March 1942, towed by a Handley Page Halifax bomber. A second prototype was completed in June 1942, and further testing and development took place at a number of different airfields, including the Airborne Forces Experimental Establishment at RAF Beaulieu; all flight trials appear to have been successful, and there were few differences between the prototypes and the production models.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} {{that began with the}} {{accession}} of the Emperor Nerva and ended with the death of the Emperor Commodus, the Empire continued to weaken. It was becoming difficult to recruit enough soldiers for the army, inflation was becoming an issue, and on at least one occasion, the Empire almost went bankrupt. The most significant constitutional development during this era was the steady drift towards monarchy. M. Cocceius Nerva succeeded Domitian, and although his reign <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>short</b> for any major constitutional reforms, he did reverse some of his predecessor's abuses. He was succeeded by Trajan in 98, who then went further than even Nerva had in restoring the image of a free republic, by, for example, allowing the senate to regain some independent legislative abilities. Hadrian succeeded Trajan as Emperor. By far, his most important constitutional alteration was his creation of a bureaucratic apparatus, which included a fixed gradation of clearly defined offices, and a corresponding order of promotion. Hadrian was succeed by Antonius Pius, who made no real changes to the constitution. Antonius Pius was succeeded by Marcus Aurelius in 161. The most significant constitutional development that occurred during the reign of Marcus Aurelius was the revival of the republican principle of collegiality, as he made his brother, L. Aelius, his co-emperor. In 169, Aelius died, and in 176, Marcus Aurelius made his son, L. Aurelius Commodus, his new co-emperor. In 180, Marcus Aurelius died, and Commodus became Emperor. Commodus' tyranny revived the worst memories of the later Julian emperors, as he was more explicit than any of his predecessors in taking powers that he did not legally have, and in disregarding the constitution. He was killed in 192.|$|E
