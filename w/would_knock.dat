5|$|Encouraged by Villa's and Orozco's actions, {{as well as}} the {{outbreak}} of the Zapatista rebellion in Morelos, Madero crossed back into Mexico in February 1911. After a few minor engagements with units of Diaz's army, Madero, Orozco and Villa decided to attack the federal garrison at Ciudad Juárez. If they could take the city, they would control traffic between Mexico and the US. Furthermore, such a major success by the revolutionaries could very well be the final push that <b>would</b> <b>knock</b> over the Porfiriato.|$|E
5|$|Barkley's distant cousin, Illinois Governor Adlai Stevenson II (grandson {{of former}} vice {{president}} Adlai Stevenson I), was considered his primary competition for the nomination, but had not committed before the convention. Richard Russell, Jr. and Tennessee Senator Estes Kefauver were also interested in the nomination. Kentucky's delegation to the 1952 Democratic National Convention announced that they would support Barkley, and Truman encouraged Missouri's delegates to do so. Democratic National Committee chairman Frank E. McKinney, former chairman James Farley, and Senate Secretary Leslie Biffle also supported him. Two weeks before the convention, Stevenson advisor Jacob Arvey told Barkley that Stevenson {{was not going to}} be nominated and favored nominating Barkley. Barkley's advisors believed that Kefauver and Russell <b>would</b> <b>knock</b> each other out of the early balloting, allowing Barkley to capture the nomination.|$|E
5|$|After {{cancelling}} the self-destruct, {{they find}} the Bynars have uploaded massive amounts of information to the Enterprise computers, but {{they are unable to}} decode it. Realizing that Minuet was purposely created by the Bynars as a distraction, Picard and Riker ask the simulation {{about what is going on}} as the ship nears the orbit of Bynar. Minuet explains that a star near the Bynar homeworld had gone supernova, and the EMP it emitted <b>would</b> <b>knock</b> out their computer systems, effectively killing the Bynars. They had used the Enterprise to upload their computer information for safekeeping and then planned to download it back to the Bynar computers after the threat of the EMP had passed. With Data's help, Picard and Riker successfully download the data, and the Bynars recover. They apologize for their actions, having feared that Starfleet would refuse to help, though Picard notes they only had to ask. As the Enterprise returns to Starbase, Riker returns to the holodeck to thank Minuet but finds that without the Bynar data, the simulation has regressed to the expected norm for the holodeck, and while Minuet still exists, she is not the same as before. Riker reports to Picard that Minuet is gone.|$|E

Victoria would counter a Widow's peak attempt by Holly into a Backslide pin to win the match and retain the WWE Women's Championship. Holly tried running towards the {{backstage}} area to escape the match's stipulation, but was eventually stopped by Victoria, who <b>would</b> <b>knock</b> her out and shave her bald.|$|E
25|$|Campaign 74B (2 February30 April 1971) {{was a major}} {{combined}} arms offensive by the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) during the Laotian Civil War. The Communist offensive, if successful, <b>would</b> <b>knock</b> the last remaining fighting troops of the Kingdom of Laos out of the war, ensuring the Vietnamese conquest of Laos. The 316th PAVN Divisionreinforced by artillery, tanks, and sappersattacked {{during a period of}} slackened tactical air support for General Vang Pao's guerrilla army; Operation Lam Son 719 was being waged at the same time. Having captured the highly strategic Plain of Jars during Operation 74B, the Communists attackers managed to penetrate deeply enough to fire upon the main guerrilla base at Long Tieng.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from a few}} {{isolated}} victories, the war had {{not gone}} well for Britain since 1754. In all theatres except India and North America (where Pitt's strategy had led to important gains in 1758) {{they were on the}} retreat. British agents received information about a planned French invasion which <b>would</b> <b>knock</b> Britain out of the war completely. While France starved their colonial forces of troops and supplies to concentrate them on the goal of total strategic supremacy in Europe, the British government agreed to continue their policy of shipping their own troops to fight for total victory in the colonies—leaving Britain to be guarded by the large militia that had existed since 1757.|$|E

25|$|If a {{criminal}} {{could make it}} to a church, he was given sanctuary. This was a recognition that the Church was a separate jurisdiction. Some law allowed for the criminal to be housed and fed by the clergy for seven days. Bracton recommends 40 days. After this, the reeve <b>would</b> <b>knock</b> {{on the door of}} the church and demand that the criminal surrender himself or take the shortest road to a seaport and leave England never to return. If he did not leave the church, he was to be starved. If the criminal stayed on the road to the seaport, he was to be left unharmed. If he went off the road, he could be killed by the population at large. Condemned criminals and those found with stolen goods were not to be given sanctuary. The wife of such was declared a widow and all lands owned by him were escheated to the Crown.|$|E

Buck's job in Arlington was as a sawmill hand. When the 15-year-old Buck met Rockwell to pose for the first time, Buck only stood [...] tall. At that time, Buck had a lock of hair that used to drop down on his forehead. Rockwell had been seeking a model, and met Buck at a square dance in Arlington, Vermont.

500|$|Roosevelt's {{support of}} African-American rights made her an unpopular figure among {{whites in the}} South. Rumors spread of [...] "Eleanor Clubs" [...] formed by {{servants}} to oppose their employers and [...] "Eleanor Tuesdays" [...] on which African-American men <b>would</b> <b>knock</b> down white women on the street, though no evidence has ever been found of either practice. When race riots broke out in Detroit in June 1943, critics in both the North and South wrote that Roosevelt was to blame. At the same time, she grew so popular among African-Americans, previously a reliable Republican voting bloc, that they became a consistent base {{of support for the}} Democratic Party.|$|E

He <b>would</b> <b>knock</b> down trophies of his sister and challenge his sister Krystal to games. His sister later said, [...] "Most people learn basketball early on with a one-on-one kind of mentality... Tim {{at an early age}} didn't have that. He always wanted to make the team better and {{do whatever it takes to}} help team out. He is such a true point guard." [...] In his childhood, he was considered too small for contact sports, but was noted for his quickness, which helped him thrive as a guard on the court.|$|E
500|$|Clough {{was quoted}} as saying [...] "I'm not {{equipped}} to manage successfully without Peter Taylor. I am the shop window and he is the goods in the back." [...] The two worked as a pair by complementing each other's strengths, as Clough had a forceful personality and was adept at motivating players, whilst Taylor was more reserved, though he had an ability to spot talented players. Former Hartlepools player Cliff Wright described the pair as [...] "good cop, bad cop. Cloughie <b>would</b> <b>knock</b> you to the ground, verbally at least, and Pete would pick you up and put you back together." [...] As the bigger personality and the man with the title of manager, Clough garnered much greater publicity than Taylor, which caused Taylor to grumble that [...] "I sometimes wonder why he never says to Bell's whisky, for instance, when they're handing out Manager of the Month awards, 'You'll have to present an extra gallon bottle. There are two of us." [...] On a personal level they were very close, and often finished each other's sentences.|$|E
500|$|The {{fountain}} uses [...] per hour, 97% {{of which}} is recycled back into the system. [...] Getting the water to the spout took ingenuity. Although consideration was given to omitting a LED tile, {{it was determined that}} the images would then look as though they were each missing a tooth. Instead, one tile in each tower is recessed about [...] to allow the installation of [...] clear tubing for the water nozzle. The water regularly spills over the fountain and down the sides of the towers and intermittently spouts from the nozzle. Two essential custom fittings contribute to the artistic vision of the fountain: a custom glass block at the upper edge for guiding the water's descent while remaining unobtrusive, and a plastic nozzle fitted to the stainless steel frame to control the rate of water flow and reduce liability to the city for any injuries sustained by the fountain's interactive participants. The interactive participants are usually children playing in the stream from the water spout or under the cascade. The risk that the spouting water <b>would</b> <b>knock</b> people down made the design both a legal and a physical challenge.|$|E

500|$|The Who's That Girl World Tour was musically and {{technically}} {{superior to}} Madonna's Virgin Tour, because she incorporated multimedia components {{to make the}} show more compelling. As the tour was confirmed, Madonna and her team started planning for it. Madonna wanted a show which consisted of theatrics, drama, dance and choreography in [...] "full-force". Her publicist Liz Rosenberg commented, [...] "She wants a visual impact that <b>would</b> <b>knock</b> people out. She was very determined about this. And she's the type that makes decisions quickly; If something doesn't work, she starts over. You'll see a different look this year, but it's still Madonna, still bigger than life." [...] In order to engage herself completely and handle the grueling dance routines, she started attending aerobics classes at Hollywood health centre The Sports Connection. By the time the tour drew nearer, she hired a personal trainer, and her daily routine involved jogging, weight-lifting, dancing, gymnastics, trampoline, swimming and cycling. She started eating vegetarian food with plenty of protein and carbohydrate and avoided the sun. British funk band Level 42 was the supporting act of the tour. Madonna's image {{was that of a}} blond girl with soft curls, making a striking contrast with the firm, almost hard lines of her eye make-up and lipstick; the idea of her friend actress Debi Mazar.|$|E
500|$|Sadleir notes how Walpole's {{considerable}} income {{enabled him}} to indulge not only his love of art and of old books and manuscripts, but also philanthropy, particularly towards younger writers. Although Walpole enjoyed the limelight, he was secretive about his many acts of generosity to younger writers, with both encouragement and financial help. After his death {{some idea of the}} scale of his generosity was discovered. Osbert Sitwell commented, [...] "I don't think there was any younger writer of any worth who has not {{at one time or another}} received kindness of an active kind, and at a crucial moment, from Hugh". Hart-Davis lists thirty-eight authors from whom letters of gratitude were found among Walpole's correspondence; Sadleir writes of Walpole's [...] "generous kindness to literary aspirants and to writers fallen on evil days... by immediate financial assistance, by prefaces freely supplied or by collaboration volunteered, by introductions and recommendations to likely publishers, Walpole relieved the distresses of authorship to a degree which will never be fully known." [...] Agate, though himself the recipient of Walpole's generosity on occasion, thought it sometimes went too far: [...] "Mr Walpole's large-heartedness gets him into all kinds of trouble. He is an inveterate patter. He pats on the back young men whom sterner critics <b>would</b> <b>knock</b> down, because even in fantastic incompetence he perceives the good intention. No art or artist is safe from Mr Walpole's benevolence".|$|E
500|$|The {{plans for}} the raid were centred on two dive-bombing attacks by Fleet Air Arm Fairey Barracuda aircraft. Each of the attacks was to involve 21 Barracudas escorted by 40 fighters; Vought F4U Corsairs flying from Victorious would provide {{protection}} against German aircraft while Grumman F4F Wildcat and F6F Hellcats operating from Furious and the escort carriers , [...] and [...] were to strafe anti-aircraft batteries near Tirpitz, {{as well as the}} battleship herself. Further aircraft flying from Furious and the escort carrier [...] would protect the fleet against attack by German aircraft or submarines. While carrier aircraft had previously lacked a bomb capable of penetrating a battleship's thick deck armour, it was hoped that the recently developed [...] armour-piercing bomb would be able to pierce at least the first layer of Tirpitzs armour if they were dropped from an altitude of [...] or higher. The damage caused by such hits was expected to put the battleship out of service. Nine of the Barracudas were to be armed with 1,600-pound bombs and a further 22 would each carry three 500-pound semi-armour-piercing bombs that were capable of penetrating the lightly protected upper decks of the ship if dropped from above [...] The remaining ten aircraft would be armed with 500- and 600-pound general-purpose bombs and with anti-submarine bombs intended to inflict casualties among the battleship's crew and cause underwater damage if they exploded in the water near her hull. The aircraft carrying high-explosive bombs were to initiate the dive bombing of Tirpitz as it was hoped that these weapons <b>would</b> <b>knock</b> out {{at least some of the}} battleship's anti-aircraft guns before the main attack commenced.|$|E
