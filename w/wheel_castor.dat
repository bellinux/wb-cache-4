40|$|Control of {{wheeled chassis}} does not {{constitute}} {{a problem in the}} area of mobile robotic solely. Rather, it can be encountered in transportation, both at close range and long range. In this thesis, mobile chassis are characterized as kinematic models. These models prove to be erroneous at high speed, whereas they sufficiently accurately represent the real robotic system in situations when slow, autonomous motion of the robot is desired. In comparison with dynamic models, both their project and implementation are simpler, too. The first part of this thesis is focused on a basic description of the motion of a robot in-plane. In the next part, five, most frequently used wheels in robotics are described and characterized - standard fixed wheels, standard steering <b>wheels,</b> <b>castor</b> <b>wheels,</b> multidirectional wheels and omnidirectional wheels. The motion conditions are deduced from each type of wheel. There are two methods of projecting the mobile robot model – full modelling and generic modelling. Based on these two methods, six models of mobile robots with different motion properties are proposed and described. The last and most extensive part of this thesis deals with simulator of robot motion created in Matlab/Simulink. It includes users guide which allows the configuration of random chassis and various trajectories of motion. In this way, it is possible to visually evaluace and classify the the different types of robots.

40|$|In this research, a new {{approach}} to develop an object pushing system with a simple mobile robot with two DC servo motor driven <b>wheels</b> and two <b>castor</b> <b>wheels</b> are introduced. This is an attempt to design and develop a system with less number of sensors to detect the reaction force generated on the mobile robot while pushing an object. The robot behavior is such that it always tends to push the object towards the center of the pusher attached to the robot. This is achieved by rotating one driving wheel of the robot by a fixed amount of rotation. This rotation is such that the motor torque is increased continuously by increasing the motor driving positive pulse width of the pulse width modulated signal from its neutral position until the required amount or rotation is obtained. At this moment the motor stops and the wheel attached to the other motor follows the same operation. This motion creates a zigzag movement on the pushing plate attached in front of the robot. This zigzag motion always moves the object towards the centre of the pusher. When the object comes close to the centre of the pusher the force applied from both motors becomes equal. Detection of this force is done by using the positive pulse width of the motor and the encoder pulses generated by the optical encoder attached to both wheels of the robot. The test results are given to support the proposed approach...|$|R

The Bleriot XI had pivoting main gear legs, which passively allowed the main gear <b>wheels</b> to <b>castor</b> together about each of their vertical axes as a unit to allow small-angle crosswind landings, with bungee-cord loaded rigging members between the lower ends of the main wheel forks, to bring the wheels back to a [...] "directly-ahead" [...] orientation after touchdown.|$|R

30|$|A growing {{issue in}} the paralympic {{movement}} {{is the impact of}} equipment on performance. In this systematic review, equipment was defined as a covariate in relation to the study goal. Athletes are competitive by nature and will try to enhance their performance as well as limit the impact of impairment on performance by using optimised equipment. This use of equipment is sport specific and often based on experience. However, the equipment permitted in wheelchair court sports shows similarities across sports [12 - 14]. Studies in this review explored the use of belts and straps, wheelchair set up, seating configuration and functional electrical stimulation (FES). Two studies assessed the possible influence of equipment in relation to trunk impairment [36, 38] though equipment that is not used for wheelchair court sports was tested [13, 16]. The only study that assessed equipment used in court sports found that multidirectional reach improves in athletes with SCI by the use of a thigh or trunk belt [31]. Reach {{is only one of the}} many relevant activities for wheelchair court sport, and in addition to belting, the chair set up (position of the seat and the backrest and height of the backrest) is also believed to impact on reach [16]. In one study, FES of the trunk extensor muscles was used to improve unsupported seating and to lift objects with different weights [39]. Functional electrical stimulation primarily impacts on impairment in muscle strength. The use of implanted electrodes as a piece of equipment is new to moment in the paralympic movement. So far, there is no consensus if this equipment should be allowed during sport performance and whether or not this equipment should be part of athlete evaluation in classification [43]. On the other hand, in the study exploring the effect of trunk impairment on acceleration in wheelchair racing, athletes used their own custom designed wheelchair. It must be noted that a racing wheelchair seating configuration is quite different from the configuration of a wheelchair for court sports. Opposite to wheelchairs used for court sports, the racing wheelchair does not have rear <b>castor</b> <b>wheels</b> to prevent tipping when maximum force is applied on the wheel [44]. As a consequence of the absence of the <b>castor</b> <b>wheel,</b> the racing athletes in this study may not have been able to use maximum force in accelerating, because of the risk of tipping backward. This limits the generalisation of the results of this study regarding the impact of trunk impairment on acceleration to wheelchair court sports. Additional research is necessary to examine the acceleration in a court sports wheelchair with the typical rear <b>castor</b> <b>wheels</b> to determine if trunk muscle strength does impact on acceleration when tipping of the chair is prevented.|$|R

30|$|A {{differential}} two-wheeled robot is {{a mobile}} robot whose movement {{is based on}} two separately driven wheels placed {{on either side of}} the robot body. It can thus change its direction by varying the relative rate of rotation of its wheels and hence does not require an additional steering motion. One or more free wheels (or ‘castor’ wheels) assure the robot equilibrium. Each <b>castor</b> <b>wheel</b> is independently mounted on a vertical non-drive axis of the body and it is automatically and freely aligned on the route as a result of the forces developed by the two ‘drive wheels’. If both wheels are driven in the same direction and at the same speed, the robot will go in a straight line. Otherwise, depending on the speed of rotation and its direction, the centre of rotation may fall anywhere in the line that joins the two wheels. Since the direction of the robot is dependent on the rate and direction of rotation of the two driven wheels, these quantities should be sensed and controlled precisely. This usually creates some problem. If both wheels are turned with equal speed in opposite directions, the robot will rotate about the central point of the axis.|$|R
40|$|Wheeled mobile robots (WMRs) {{have been}} widely used for {{navigation}} purposes as well as industrial applications such as path tracking and obstacle detections. Differential drive robot (DDR) is one type of WMRs with a specific wheel configuration where two fixed wheels are controlled by the motors and a <b>castor</b> <b>wheel</b> is added to mechanically support its translational and rotational movements. For tracking purposes, the controller plays a very important role to ensure it does not deviate far from the targeted locations or path. In this project, a DDR is built with two DC motors. As most motors exhibit nonlinear behavior, they are modeled as a multivariable Hammerstein-Wiener structure which contains static nonlinearities and a linear system in series with each other. The identification of the linear model is performed via time response analysis with different types of inputs, whereas the nonlinearities are estimated via several tests in MATLAB Simulink. This work also focuses on both dynamic and kinematic models of the DDR where a proportional-integral (PI) controller is designed to achieve the desired specifications in the linear region. In order to account for the nonlinear effects from the DC motor model which is mainly influenced by its bounded velocity capability, a static anti-windup compensator (AWC) is implemented which is activated when the controller output exceeds the bound. Via this strategy, a significant improvement on the tracking performance of the DDR can be observed via simulations especially when the desired path involves sharp corners or turns. ...|$|R
