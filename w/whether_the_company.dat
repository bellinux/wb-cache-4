The number of ducks that died was originally reported at around 500, but in March 2009 Syncrude revealed that the number was in fact more than 1,600. In response to accusations from opposition and environmental groups that his government, which had known the actual number since the summer of 2008, had participated in covering it up to save face, Stelmach asserted that it had refrained from making the higher number public for fear of jeopardizing its investigation of whether Syncrude had violated any provincial regulations in the incident. [...] Investigations were centred around the questions of whether Syncrude had immediately reported the incident as required (the government had first heard of it from an anonymous tip, though Syncrude reported it several hours later) and <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> had the required measures in place to prevent ducks from landing on its tailings ponds (it had noisemakers designed to deter waterfowl, but these had not been set up {{at the time of}} the incident due to winter weather conditions).

2500|$|<b>Whether</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> {{had done}} work on land {{owned by the}} federal {{government}} was a critical issue, because in 1930 the Supreme Court had held in Surplus Trading Co. v. Cook, 281 U.S. 647 (1930), that private personal property on federal land cannot be taxed by the state. Citing numerous Court precedents, Hughes noted that title to the river bed lay with the state even though the Constitution granted the federal government the power to use the river bed [...] "for any structure which the interest of navigation, in its judgment, may require." [...] But what about the land adjacent to the river bed which had been acquired {{by the federal government}}? Article 1, Section 8, Clause 17 of the U.S. Constitution gave Congress exclusive legislation power over such places so long as the state legislature concurred. Hughes, however, noted that the state had not granted exclusive jurisdiction to the federal government. Clause 17 also required that the construction on [...] "exclusive" [...] land be [...] "needful buildings". [...] Were dams and locks needful buildings? [...] Hughes concluded they were, citing several lower court rulings as well as the West Virginia law allowing the United States to purchase the land. [...] The defendant had argued that West Virginia had ceded exclusive jurisdiction to the federal government, but in a lengthy review of the legislative language Hughes argued for an interpretation which found that only concurrent jurisdiction had been granted. As to private property leased by the company in order to carry out its federal contract, Hughes perfunctorily dismissed any challenge to the jurisdiction of the state over this area.|$|E
