5|$|In 1958, {{a section}} {{bypassing}} Morrisburg was opened to accommodate traffic displaced from {{a portion of}} Highway2 through The Lost Villages of the Saint Lawrence Seaway. Highway 2 <b>would</b> <b>ultimately</b> be reopened on a new alignment which followed the CN rail right-of-way.|$|E
5|$|On October 30, 2017, Sánchez {{revealed}} on the Diminishing Returns podcast {{that he and}} {{the rest}} of the film's creative team are developing a Blair Witch television series, though he pointed out that any decisions <b>would</b> <b>ultimately</b> be up to Lionsgate now that they own the rights to it.|$|E

5|$|Callisto's leading {{hemisphere}} is less reflective {{than its}} trailing hemisphere, which could indicate {{that one of}} its sides has a higher surface temperature. On this darker, warmer side, sublimation rates of its icy surface would also be higher, causing more water vapor to be released into the atmosphere. This process <b>would</b> <b>ultimately</b> produce more hydrogen, which might explain the aforementioned variance in Callisto's atmospheric hydrogen levels.|$|E
5|$|Following the match, {{the referee}} {{admitted}} {{that at one}} point during the game the ball had passed the Blackburn goal line, but as Queen's Park did not attempt to claim the goal, it was not awarded. Queen's Park <b>would</b> <b>ultimately</b> become the only Scottish club to reach the final of the FA Cup, although they returned the following year where they again faced Blackburn Rovers.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, Raytheon Engineers and Constructors {{proposed}} {{to build and}} operate a Dulles Corridor Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system. In January 1999, the Tysons-Dulles Corridor Group (which included Bechtel Corporation and West*Group) offered a competing BRT proposal that <b>would</b> <b>ultimately</b> extend the rail line to Ashburn. These proposals prompted the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) to evaluate the merits of BRT and heavy rail public transit in the corridor.|$|E

5|$|In general relativity, gravity {{becomes a}} fictitious force that arises in {{situations}} where spacetime deviates from a flat geometry. As an extension, Kaluza–Klein theory and string theory ascribe electromagnetism and the other fundamental forces respectively to the curvature of differently scaled dimensions, which <b>would</b> <b>ultimately</b> imply that all forces are fictitious.|$|E
5|$|Likewise, {{the generous}} donativum {{bestowed}} upon the soldiers following his accession {{was expected to}} swiftly silence any protests against the violent regime change. The Praetorians considered these measures insufficient, however, and demanded the execution of Domitian's assassins, which Nerva refused. Continued dissatisfaction with {{this state of affairs}} <b>would</b> <b>ultimately</b> lead to the gravest crisis of Nerva's reign.|$|E
5|$|Low-cost {{loans for}} farmers and {{replaced}} the labor service {{with a tax}} instead, hoping this <b>would</b> <b>ultimately</b> help {{the workings of the}} entire economy and state (as he directly linked state income to the level of prosperity of rural peasants who owned farms, produced goods for the market, and paid the land tax). These government loans replaced the system of landlords offering their tenants private loans, which was prohibited under the new laws of Wang's reforms.|$|E

5|$|Muhanna was {{succeeded by}} his son Musa, and his {{descendants}} filled the office of amir al-ʿarab {{for the next seven}} decades with minor interruption. Throughout his reign, Muhanna was granted numerous iqtaʿat (fiefs) by an-Nasir, including Palmyra, Salamiyah, Sarmin and Douma. Muhanna later criticized an-Nasir's generous iqtaʿ distribution to the Bedouin tribes, believing it <b>would</b> <b>ultimately</b> degrade the character of the Bedouin and in turn, weaken the Muslim armies.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{was already}} under way in January 2005, when Baron Cohen caused a near riot in what <b>would</b> <b>ultimately</b> be the rodeo scene in the final cut of the film.

5|$|Rademacher {{envisioned the}} {{founding}} of a European bank that <b>would</b> <b>ultimately</b> liquidate all European Jewish assets {{to pay for the}} plan. This bank would then play an intermediary role between Madagascar {{and the rest of the}} world, as Jews would not be allowed to interact financially with outsiders.

5000|$|Durin the Deathless {{was buried}} in a tomb in Khazad-dûm. The Dwarves {{regarded}} him as in longeval [...] "sleep" [...] rather than dead: a book-end to his long primeval sleep, from which he <b>would</b> likewise <b>ultimately</b> awake.|$|R
50|$|The Raglan Agreement, {{signed in}} 1995, {{was the first}} Impact Benefit Agreement (IBA) in Canada to be {{negotiated}} and signed directly between a mining company and the Aboriginal group that <b>would</b> be <b>ultimately</b> effected by the mining operation.|$|R
5|$|The Blitz class avisos {{were the}} first step toward {{creating}} the modern, steel-hulled light cruiser, which <b>would</b> <b>ultimately</b> come to fruition in the , built a decade later. The Blitz-class ships were also the first steel-hulled ships of any type built by the German Navy. At the time of their completion, they were among the earliest torpedo cruisers in the world.|$|E
5|$|The ECSC {{was run by}} four institutions: a High Authority {{composed}} of independent appointees, a Common Assembly {{composed of}} national parliamentarians, a Special Council composed of nation ministers, and a Court of Justice.

5|$|The Siege of Naxos (499 BC) was {{a failed}} {{attempt by the}} Milesian tyrant Aristagoras, {{operating}} with support from, and {{in the name of}} the Persian Empire of Darius the Great, to conquer the island of Naxos.

5|$|The oil {{industry}} <b>would</b> <b>ultimately</b> {{prove to be}} a resource curse to Wichita Falls, and the Texas Oil Boom ended only a few years later. The building was vacated, boarded up, and virtually forgotten in 1929 as the Great Depression struck North Texas and office space became relatively inexpensive to lease or purchase. A fire gutted the building in 1931, rendering it unusable for a number of years.|$|E
5|$|This led to {{proposals}} {{for a new}} radar dedicated solely to the early warning role, determining only which MAR or SCD <b>would</b> <b>ultimately</b> {{have to deal with}} the threat. Used primarily in the first minutes of the attack, and not responsible for the engagements, the system could be considered disposable and did not need anything like the sophistication or hardening of the MAR. This led to the Perimeter Acquisition Radar (PAR), which would operate cheaper electronics at VHF frequencies.|$|E
5|$|Blount {{started off}} the 2011 season with only 5 carries for 15 yards against the Detroit Lions. The next week Blount {{reestablished}} his strong running ability with 13 carries for 71 {{yards and two}} touchdowns against the Minnesota Vikings. This includes the game-winning touchdown with 30 seconds left to play. In a Week 5 against the 49ers, Blount injured his knee after accumulating only 15 yards rushing and was forced to miss weeks 6 and 7. Blount <b>would</b> <b>ultimately</b> return for the matchup with the New Orleans Saints. On November 20, 2011, Blount broke free from eight Green Bay Packers tacklers and scored on a 54-yard touchdown run.|$|E

50|$|CFG have {{previously}} been linked with investment into European sides AS Saint-Étienne, Estoril and Boavista although any such plans - {{none of which}} have having been any more than brief reports of interest - <b>would</b> likely <b>ultimately</b> be seen as inviable due to UEFA's 'conflict of interest' laws regarding multiple club ownership.|$|R
