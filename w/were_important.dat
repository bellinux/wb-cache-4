Some of {{the regions}} <b>were</b> <b>important</b> for national security, while other regions <b>were</b> <b>important</b> {{to the expansion}} of Soviet socialism to other countries. According to an anonymous Soviet writer, the national liberation struggle was the cornerstone of Soviet ideology, and therefore became a cornerstone for Soviet diplomatic activity in the Third World.|$|E

Three potbelly monuments were found resting on a large terrace in Santa Leticia in El Salvador, a site near Chalchuapa consisting of various mounds and platforms. These monuments were large and especially obese. Santa Leticia Monuments 1 and 3 <b>were</b> <b>important</b> in securely dating the potbelly style of sculpture.

5|$|Birds {{are often}} {{important}} to island ecology. Birds have frequently reached islands that mammals have not; on those islands, birds may fulfil ecological roles typically played by larger animals. For example, in New Zealand the moas <b>were</b> <b>important</b> browsers, {{as are the}} kereru and kokako today. Today the plants of New Zealand retain the defensive adaptations evolved {{to protect them from}} the extinct moa. Nesting seabirds may also affect the ecology of islands and surrounding seas, principally through the concentration of large quantities of guano, which may enrich the local soil and the surrounding seas.|$|E

Diane produced further rainfall in already wet areas from Connie.
