25|$|We {{did some}} rather audacious things. We shot {{on top of}} a train in Train Town in Griffith Park without a permit, while one of us was given one of the guards money and another of us was talking to another guard, just so <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> shots finished. We knew we couldn't be there long. All we had to do was do our legerdemain for five or ten minutes and be out of there. And we {{certainly}} couldn't pay for it.|$|E
500|$|According to Baley, on July 29 Savedra {{informed}} the Rose–Baley Party, now camped near Leroux Springs, {{that the next}} reliable drinking water was seventy or [...] away, and {{there would not be}} a closer source until the coming rainy season. This distance exceeded what most animals could travel without water, and several members of the party were opposed to proceeding any further west until another source had been found. Udell disagreed, [...] "I contended that we had better travel on, for, with careful and proper treatment, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> stock through to water, and if we remain here until the rainy season, in all human probability our provisions would be exhausted, and we should parish with starvation." [...] Despite his pleas, nobody wanted to go on until they had located potable water, so six men agreed to undertake a search in hopes that Savedra had overlooked a closer source. Two days later, a man returned to camp and reported that a spring had been found [...] west, but its supply was so sparse that it could not {{meet the needs of the}} entire wagon train at once. After a thorough debate it was decided that, despite stern warnings from Army officers in Albuquerque against splitting into smaller groups, the best course of action was to divide the train in two and water their stock separately.|$|E

2500|$|The alumni {{reported}} that the C response was evasive, deceptive, and employed “stonewalling” tactics. Alumni were reportedly told that they should forgive, {{and that they would}} [...] "hurt the name of Jesus" [...] by coming forward. [...] One alumnus said that [...] "the only way that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> Alliance to do anything was through the media. It was only through shaming them by putting the truth out there". Robert Fetherlin, vice president for International Ministries for the C, said [...] "We heard {{as far back as the}} 1980s that there were some questionable events that took place at Mamou. That there may have been mistreatment of children, however, we were slower than we should have been in responding to that." ...|$|E
2500|$|A major {{technical}} issue {{was that of}} frame rate. Shiny set a target of maintaining a constant frame rate of at least 30fps at all times on all machines, and so they simply play-tested the game multiple times. Any moment when the frame rate dropped below 30, they either removed something from that particular part of the game, rewrote the graphics code, or altered the artwork until they could get the frame rate up to where they wanted without having to reduce the resolution or increase the pixel size. According to Bruty, [...] "We {{had no idea how}} fast <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> engine when we started. The game would run too slow if we textured everything, so some parts were just flat-shaded for speed. We did our best to make that look like a design choice, or shadows, but it was a tricky balance." ...|$|E
2500|$|All's {{previous}} albums {{had been}} released through Cruz Records, an independent record label that was an imprint of SST Records. With the commercial success of punk and alternative rock bands in the early 1990s, All began considering offers from major labels. [...] "Major label talk started probably around '93 or '94", recalled guitarist Stephen Egerton. [...] "We maybe were just looking to sort of {{go to the next}} place, maybe. We had done this slow building up to where as many as a thousand people might be coming to see us in some places, which for us was a huge deal, so we thought we'd try to see if maybe <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> records out to more people." [...] "In {{the past year or so}} we've seen bands like Green Day and Season to Risk turning up at the Walmart in Brookfield, Missouri", [...] remarked bassist Karl Alvarez. [...] "We really like the idea of getting our records in places where people go who aren't hip to the mom-and-pop record stores that traditionally carry the independents. People forget that punk rock was on the majors early on with bands like Iggy and the Ramones. The fact that the major labels ignored the real groundbreaking rock of the '80s gave everyone a real bad feeling about the majors, but as it stands now, they are starting to get a little hipper." ...|$|E

2500|$|Because sniper mode was a {{major part}} of the game, with the ability to zoom up to 100x, the team decided not to employ any of the usual {{techniques}} to limit pop-up, such as clipping and fogging. A major technical issue was that of frame rate. Shiny felt most PC games maintained frame rate by using big pixels in low resolution, which works as long as the game is not running SVGA mode. Based on their experiences developing for consoles, they wanted to take a different approach; using small pixels in high resolution. They set a target of maintaining a constant frame rate of at least 30fps at all times on all machines, and so they simply play-tested the game multiple times. Any moment when the frame rate dropped below 30, they either removed something from that particular part of the game, rewrote the graphics code, or altered the artwork until they could get the frame rate back up to where they wanted without having to reduce the resolution or increase the pixel size. According to Bruty, [...] "We had no idea how fast <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> engine when we started.

6000|$|... "I don't think so," [...] {{returned}} Dave. [...] "I think, if he {{was questioned}} long enough, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> truth out of him. He doesn't seem to be crazy all the time." ...|$|E
60|$|During breakfast, we were {{discussing}} whether <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> through <b>the</b> snow to Mont St. Bernard. Some thought <b>we</b> <b>could,</b> and some thought not. So it goes here: we are gasping and sweltering one hour, and plunging through snow banks the next.|$|R

5000|$|We {{went with}} <b>the</b> guys <b>we</b> thought <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> job done. It's {{not because of}} {{brothers}} like the Hamms or personalities. This was about {{what was best for}} the team. This is the team we believe can bring home a medal.|$|R
6000|$|... "I see--I see!" [...] {{said the}} little Brown Bear, wagging his stuffed head. [...] "Then, if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> apron from Mrs. Yoop, we {{could open the}} doors and escape from our prison." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No {{sooner than}} you'd propose to Grace," [...] was Tom's prompt answer, which made Sam blush.

6000|$|Juanita Haydock {{broke in}} with a derisive, [...] "Oh rats, Raymie! Can the mother's influence! I say let's give {{something}} with some class to it.

6000|$|... "Ay, Ned, {{make the}} best of it, as usual; but, if you do not come round to my way of thinking, before you are a twelvemonth older, I shall renounce prophesying. I wish <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> at <b>the</b> bottom of Miss Effingham's thoughts, on this occasion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We couldn't herd {{them in the}} dark. Besides, it's an {{extensive}} fire, and I'm doubtful whether <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> down to <b>the</b> water farther along." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We were told," [...] Aynesworth answered, [...] "that {{there was}} a gate in the wall there, through which <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> on to <b>the</b> cliffs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have chosen}} {{between me and}} her," [...] he said; and before <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> poor lady to the seat under the oak, {{he had left the}} garden.

6000|$|... "To be sure. If those goats {{can pull}} wagons, they can {{certainly}} pull sleds, too. Then, I thought if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> goats to pull {{us all the}} way to Colby Hall, it wouldn't be any more than fair to take the goats in out of the cold and treat 'em nicely." ...|$|E
6000|$|They both {{declared}} {{they should}} prefer it to anything. [...] "Then, Betsey, my dear, {{run into the}} kitchen and see if Rebecca has put the water on; and tell her to bring in the tea-things as soon as she can. I wish <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> bell mended; but Betsey is a very handy little messenger." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If my lord {{is not too}} wearied, {{it would}} be well if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> across <b>the</b> crest before morning. They will have sentries at every point whence they can command {{a view of the}} hills; and our figures could be made out, on the snow, at a great {{distance}} away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; <b>we</b> three <b>could</b> <b>get</b> under <b>the</b> counter {{without much}} trouble, an' there's a stove b'longs to it, {{that goes in}} with the trade." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is wretched seeing nothing here," [...] she said, feverishly. [...] "Do {{you think}} <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> up to <b>the</b> {{top of the}} tower of Notre Dame?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{only meant}} to say," [...] said the Dodo {{in a rather}} {{offended}} tone, [...] "that I know of a house near here, where <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> young lady {{and the rest of}} the party dried, and then we could listen comfortably to the story which I think you were good enough to promise to tell us," [...] bowing gravely to the mouse.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was torn}} {{out of the}} dead man's hand. Why was some one so anxious to get {{possession}} of it? Because it incriminated him. And {{what would he do}} with it? Thrust it into his pocket, most likely, never noticing that a corner of it had been left in the grip of the corpse. If <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> rest of that sheet it is obvious that we should have gone a long way towards solving the mystery." ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{we gave it}} up, {{completely}} routed, and hoisted sail {{and started}} on the long windward beat back to Benicia. A number of Sundays went by, on each of which the law was persistently violated. Yet, short of an armed force of soldiers, we could do nothing. The fishermen had hit upon a new idea and were using it for all it was worth, while there seemed no way by which <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> better of them.|$|E
60|$|Accordingly {{we stood}} away north, but found {{ourselves}} so entangled among innumerable islands, {{and without any}} pilot that understood the channel and races between them, that we were obliged to give it over, and resolved to go back again to Banda, and see what <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> among <b>the</b> other islands thereabouts.|$|R
60|$|Dumont humbly {{suggested}} {{here that}} <b>we</b> <b>could</b> at all events {{act on the}} principle that guided Adam and Eve in the formation of their first water-mill, and find out by experiment.

6000|$|... "But {{sometimes}} it is a trump, my dear young lady," [...] said the Colonel, with unabated gallantry; [...] "and when yo' mothah uses yarn, it is worsteds.
