25|$|An {{interlude}} follows {{with the}} Snow Queen and Kay talking in her ice palace throne room. Kay {{is playing with}} ice crystals when the Snow Queen asks him if he knows <b>what</b> <b>love</b> <b>is.</b> He remembers Gerda, but he stays there because his heart is a lump of ice like the Snow Queen. The princess and her consort send Gerda on her way with a golden coach and attendants. While the coach travels through a dark woods, they are stopped by a gang of robbers, who take Gerda and strip the coach of its gold plate, sparing the attendants. An old hag takes Gerda, but when she is bitten on the ear by her daughter Angel, who is riding on her back, she listens to her request to keep Gerda with her other captive pets. These pets include a fox, little rabbits, the birds that were spared the Snow Queen's frost earlier, and a large reindeer, named Bucky Boy. The birds tell Gerda that they saw the Snow Queen take Kay with her to Lapland. The reindeer offers to take Gerda there. It remains for the robber girl to let Gerda and Bucky Boy go, which she does. She also releases the birds, the fox, and the rabbits, but they decide to stay with her.|$|E

500|$|In 1964, singer Irma Thomas {{went into}} the studio to record the single [...] "Anyone Who Knows <b>What</b> <b>Love</b> <b>Is</b> (Will Understand)". It was decided that the b-side, a cover of Kai Winding's [...] "Time Is on My Side", needed {{additional}} lyrics, since the only words in the original composition were [...] "Time is on my side" [...] and [...] "You'll come runnin' back." [...] Norman was contacted and composed {{the rest of the}} lyrics to the tune. The Rolling Stones also recorded the song with Norman's lyrics and released it as a single, which became the band's first hit to break the top ten. The Rolling Stones' releases did credit Norman as lyric writer for a number of years, but eventually his name was removed; in the early 1990s, he was told by the publisher that the credit was not legally binding, as it had been a [...] "clerical error".|$|E

500|$|Describing [...] "Lay You Down" [...] {{as one of}} {{the more}} sensual songs on Versus, Mark Nero of About.com wrote [...] "the best of which might be the piano-laced 'Lay You Down,' on which Usher sings: 'This ain't bump 'n grind, I'll show you <b>what</b> <b>love</b> <b>is</b> if you let me lay you down. Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe commended Usher's use of falsetto, whilst writing that the song [...] "is an urgent boudoir jam that draws a neat line"– she also commented on how it takes {{inspiration}} from both Prince and Marvin Gaye. Los Angeles Timess Jeff Weiss also pointed out the influence from pop musician Prince, and how Usher is [...] "unctuously cooing about wanting to be the: one who keeps your body warm." [...] "Lay You Down" [...] entered the R/Hip-Hop Songs chart on the week ending November 13, 2010, and peaked at number fifty-six, due to strong radio play.|$|E
500|$|On June 24, 2007, just a {{few hours}} before their concert at Deer Lake Park, The White Stripes kicked off their cross-Canada tour by playing a 40-minute set for a group of 30 kids at the Creekside Youth Centre in Burnaby. The Canadian tour was also marked by concerts in small markets, such as Glace Bay, Whitehorse and Iqaluit, as well as by {{frequent}} [...] "secret shows" [...] publicized mainly by posts on The Little Room, a White Stripes fan messageboard. Gigs included performances at a bowling alley in Saskatoon, a youth center in Edmonton, a Winnipeg Transit bus and The Forks park in Winnipeg, a park in Whitehorse, the YMCA in downtown Toronto, the Arva Flour Mill in Arva, Ontario, Locas on Salter (a pool hall) in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and a famous one-note show on George Street in St. John's, Newfoundland. They played a full show later that night at the Mile One Centre in downtown St. John's. Video clips from several of the secret shows have been posted to YouTube.

500|$|<b>What</b> <b>Love</b> <b>Is</b> Made Of" [...] was premiered during Irish DJ Annie Mac's eponymous {{program on}} BBC Radio 1, on 10 May 2013, though its digital {{download}} only occurred on 5 July 2013. It was serviced as an extended play, {{where it was}} bundled with three remixes, by MK (Mark Kinchen), Felix da Housecat and Brackles. The song was ultimately excluded from Katy's second studio album, entitled Little Red. During an interview with Clash, Katy was asked about why she had not included the song in the album's track listing. To that question, she responded: [...] "I just felt that I wanted to put some music out there, really. Like, 'Aaliyah' from Danger EP is on the album, but I loved collaborating with Jessie Ware. But [...] {{means a lot to}} me , so I wanted to get it out there, regardless of whether it was on the album." [...] Having a length of three minutes and fifty-five seconds (3:55), [...] "What Love Is Made Of" [...] is an uptempo dance and house track that has been described as [...] "rave-y" [...] and [...] "trance-y". Its instrumentation contains the sounds of pianos and synthesizers. Jordan Sargent of Spin observed that it continued the musical style first introduced in Katy's 2012 extended play (EP), Danger EP, which was [...] "straight-forward house". Idolator's Sam Lansky compared her performance in the song to recording artist Siobhán Donaghy.|$|E
500|$|Several of {{the songs}} on Mwng feature quite solemn, {{personal}} lyrics, which reflect on a difficult few years for Rhys. The single, [...] "Ysbeidiau Heulog", is about [...] "looking back at a bad time which had the odd good moment", while [...] "Pan Ddaw'r Wawr" [...] deals {{with the death of}} rural communities. The singer claims to have wept—rather than sung—the album's last track, [...] "Gwreiddiau Dwfn" [...] / [...] "Mawrth Oer Ar y Blaned Neifion", which features lyrics [...] "so bleak it's almost comic" [...] about [...] "being rooted to a sad piece of land [...] being doomed to live somewhere and that's all you have and that's what you're stuck with". Rhys has described Datblygu's [...] "Y Teimlad" [...] as being about [...] "not knowing <b>what</b> <b>love</b> <b>is</b> or what love means." [...] "Drygioni" [...] is a song about [...] "sleaze [...] about good versus evil, and a person's need for both", and [...] "Y Gwyneb Iau" [...] is a [...] "moody song about war" [...] whose title is a Welsh insult that translates into English as [...] "Liverface". In contrast, [...] "Nythod Cacwn" [...] is a comedic song, based on an incident involving drummer Dafydd Ieuan being chased by bees after he disturbed a beehive while attempting to build a bonfire on a beach. It features lyrics that were [...] "made up on the spot" [...] by Rhys. [...] "Dacw Hi" [...] is inspired by one of Rhys's former teachers who claimed she had eyes {{in the back of her}} head. [...] "Sarn Helen" [...] is about the decline of the Roman road of the same name that was built between North and South Wales. [...] "Ymaelodi Â'r Ymylon" [...] is partly inspired by the ostracisation the band felt from some areas of the Welsh musical community due to their decision to sing in English on earlier albums. The track's lyrics feature the old Welsh idiom [...] "y cythraul canu", which means [...] "the demon in music" [...] and refers to the friction this can create between people.|$|E
500|$|Similar to [...] "If I Can't Love Her", [...] "Evermore" [...] {{provides}} the Beast with [...] "a stronger voice". The song occurs at a pivotal {{moment in the}} film during which the Beast bemoans his decision to free Belle, while uncovering both his inner pain and growth as a character as he voices [...] "a sad sense of longing." [...] For the first time, audiences learn exactly how the Beast feels when he allows Belle to rescue Maurice, summarizing his love for her. In the musical sequence, the Beast continues to climb higher up the turret of his castle to watch Belle as she rides away on her horse and gradually disappears into the distance. Staged {{in a way that}} resembles a live musical due to Stevens' performance and its cinematography, the orchestra increases and swells as the anguished Beast continues to climb. Menken explained that the character, singing [...] "with a raw emotion", watches Belle leave while thinking to himself [...] "I know <b>what</b> <b>love</b> <b>is</b> now, and it's wonderful, even though I'll never see her again", and [...] "Evermore" [...] captures the Beast's agony as he watches the woman he loves leave him. Citing the song {{as an example of the}} film's characters resorting to singing whenever they find that they are not able to speak, Condon described [...] "Evermore" [...] as one of the film's [...] "dramatic high points", proving that the Beast has finally become [...] "worthy of love". For the Beast, the song represents [...] "an ode to his love for Belle and his unending, longing devotion as she rides away from him, possibly forever", serving as [...] "a profound meditation on his own isolation and heartache". According to Menken, the character is [...] "basically singing about how he now knows what love is". The Beast is now shown to be capable of feeling and expressing human emotions, namely heartbreak, loneliness and helplessness, having learned about true love and sacrifice. According to Zoe Nicholson of The Daily Gamecock, [...] "Evermore" [...] "adds humanity not yet seen in a character regarded as savage or spoiled rotten." [...] Walt Disney Studios president of music and soundtracks Mitchell Leib described the scene as the film's [...] "Phantom of the Opera moment." [...] Traditionally in Disney films, heroines are typically assigned [...] "rousing" [...] musical numbers to perform. Screen Rant contributor Kacey Spivey observed that Belle's departure and the scene represents a reversal of the traditional fairy tale trope in which a princess is trapped in a tower. Instead the Beast is confined to his tower, longing for the heroine to return and free him from his enchantment. Brett Nachman compared the scene to Quasimodo performing [...] "Out There" [...] in Disney's animated musical The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996).|$|E

2500|$|When Heart in Motion was {{released}} in 1991, many fans were surprised that the album was so clearly one of contemporary pop music. Grant's desire to widen her audience was frowned upon by {{the confines of the}} popular definitions of ministry at the time. The track [...] "Baby Baby" [...] (written for Grant's newborn daughter Millie, whose [...] "six-week-old face was my inspiration,") became a pop hit (hitting No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100), and Grant was established as a name in the mainstream music world. [...] "Baby Baby" [...] received Grammy nominations for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, and Record and Song of the Year (although it failed to win in any of those categories). Four other hits from the album made the Pop top 20: [...] "Every Heartbeat" [...] (No. 2), [...] "That's <b>What</b> <b>Love</b> <b>Is</b> For" [...] (No. 7), [...] "Good for Me" [...] (No. 8), and [...] "I Will Remember You" [...] (No. 20). On the Adult Contemporary chart, all five songs were top 10 hits, with two of the five ("Baby Baby" [...] and [...] "That's <b>What</b> <b>Love</b> <b>Is</b> For") reaching No. 1. Many Christian fans remained loyal, putting the album atop Billboard Contemporary Christian Chart for 32 weeks. Heart in Motion is Grant's best-selling album, having sold over five million copies according to the RIAA. Grant followed the album with her second Christmas album, Home For Christmas in 1992, which included the song [...] "Breath of Heaven (Mary's Song)", written by Chris Eaton and Grant, and would later be covered by many artists, including Donna Summer, Jessica Simpson (who acknowledged Grant as one of her favorite artists), Vince Gill, Sara Groves, Point of Grace, Gladys Knight, and Broadway star Barbara Cook.|$|E

2500|$|In a review, Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku hailed Sword Art Online as {{the smartest}} series in recent years; Eisenbeis {{particularly}} noted how the romance between Kirito and Asuna is explored bringing [...] "definition to exactly <b>what</b> <b>love</b> <b>is</b> {{like in a}} virtual world." [...] However, the two characters' relationship {{in the second half}} of the novels was criticized, with Eisenbeis complaining about Asuna being deregulated to a damsel in distress stock character for Kirito to fight for, lamenting that the [...] "strong female lead" [...] had been [...] "reduced to nothing but the quest item the male lead is hunting for." [...] The love triangle between Kirito and the other female characters was also scrutinized; Eisenbeis considered it [...] "ludicrous" [...] that Kirito would consider abandoning Asuna, especially considering his devotion to her in the previous storyline. Nevertheless, Kirito was considered a likeable and [...] "fun" [...] character.|$|E
2500|$|On August 19, 2014, she {{released}} {{an album of}} hits remixed by well known engineers and DJs. The album was titled In Motion: The Remixes.

2500|$|Although her {{previous}} album {{was a huge}} success, Yener decided to improve and refine her music style once more. She would leave the Türk pop, paving the way to incorporate a more dance-friendly Europop sound, along with changing [...] her appearance as well. She cut and dyed her black from blonde. The result was [...] "Apayrı" [...] (Totally Different), which came out in early 2006. Some of the hit singles that came out from [...] "Apayrı" [...] included, [...] "Kelepçe" [...] (Handcuffs), [...] "Aşkın Ateşi" [...] (The Fire of Love) and [...] "Kim Bilebilir Aşkı" [...] (Who Can Guess <b>What</b> <b>Love</b> <b>Is).</b> Each of these singles featured different genres that simply wowed Turkey. [...] "Kelepçe" [...] had a groovy disco sound to it. [...] "Aşkın Ateşi" [...] was a sweet pop track and [...] "Kim Bilebilir Aşkı" [...] featured a Far-Eastern sound that had hints of techno felt throughout the song. The album sold 200 000 copies.|$|E

[...] Eisenbeis further complained that [...] "in the first arc of Sword Art Online, Asuna was a strong fighter and one of the leaders who thousands depended on to get them through the death game alive. In the second arc, she was powerless, locked in a literal bird cage and molested by her captor while waiting for her hero to rescue her. In Gun Gale Online, she was little more than a spectator cheering on her man. And even in Calibre, she was just another member of the ensemble cast." ...|$|E

2500|$|Conclusion of the Encyclical. The saints are {{the true}} bearers of light within history, for they are {{men and women of}} faith, hope and love...Outstanding among the saints is Mary, Mother of the Lord and mirror of all holiness....“My soul magnifies the Lord” (Lk 1:46). In these words she expresses her whole {{programme}} of life: not setting herself at the centre, but leaving space for God, who is encountered both in prayer and in service of neighbour—only then does goodness enter the world...The testimonials of gratitude, offered to her from every continent and culture, are a recognition of that pure love which is not self-seeking but simply benevolent. At the same time, the devotion of the faithful shows an infallible intuition of how such love is possible: it becomes so {{as a result of the}} most intimate union with God, through which the soul is totally pervaded by him—a condition which enables those who have drunk from the fountain of God's love to become in their turn a fountain from which “flow rivers of living water” (Jn 7:38). Mary, Virgin and Mother, shows us <b>what</b> <b>love</b> <b>is</b> and whence it draws its origin and its constantly renewed power. (§40-42, italics added) ...|$|E
