60|$|Then the old gentleman <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> and sat {{himself down}} on the hob, with {{the top of his}} cap {{accommodated}} up the chimney, for it was a great deal too high for the roof.|$|E
60|$|Whilst Pat <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> for {{a lighted}} piece of turf (Hibernice, coal) to kindle his patron's pipe, Thady stuck the said pipe in his jaw, and {{continued}} poring over the unsatisfactory {{figures of the}} Ballycloran rent-book.|$|E

60|$|The animal {{moved off}} at last and shambled toward the house, looking bigger and {{considerably}} more clumsy than the largest bulldog Frank had ever seen. He <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> docilely, but when Miss Oliver approached him Harry {{cried out in}} dismay.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nine o'clock struck, {{ten o'clock}} struck. At half-past ten, {{we went down}} and got our own supper, and had it in the kitchen. At a quarter-past eleven, Amenda returned. She <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> without a word, hung my hat up behind the door, and {{commenced}} clearing away the supper things.|$|E
6000|$|Alora {{sat down}} and tried to collect her thoughts. Janet got the breakfast unaided and then came to summon her. Alora quietly <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> {{and sat down at}} a little table spread for two. There was a dish of crisp bacon, some toast and coffee. Alora silently ate and drank, {{determined}} to maintain her strength. Having finished her meal she sat back and asked: ...|$|E
50|$|Cassidy <b>walks</b> <b>into</b> {{her home}} {{after school and}} her mother greets her from <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> Cassidy <b>walks</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> and sees her mother is making cupcakes for a Halloween party that her mother hosted without telling Cassidy first.

50|$|Towards the end, Broome's {{reputation}} was tainted with scandal, {{as he was}} associated to some dubious transactions and a card fixing fraud.On 31 May 1855 he <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchens</b> of <b>the</b> Wrekin Tavern, at Bow Street, took a carving knife and cut his own throat.

6000|$|... 'Not a word; {{she only}} bade me go down.' Then Michel <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> {{as though he}} were about to fetch the recusant himself. But he stopped himself, and asked his wife to go up to Marie. Madame Voss did go up, and after her return there was some {{whispering}} between her and her husband. 'She is upset by the excitement of your return,' Michel said at last; 'and we must give her a little grace. Come, we will eat our dinner.' ...|$|E
60|$|The {{alderman}} {{was really}} sorry for her, and felt himself to blame {{so far as}} that he had shifted {{the guidance of the}} expedition to such an insufficient head as poor Smallbones, so he let her rail on as much as she would, till the storm exhausted itself, and she settled into the trust that Giles would soon grow weary and return. The good man felt bound to show her all hospitality, and the civilities to country cousins were in proportion to the rarity of their visits. So Mrs. Headley stayed on after Tiptoff's return to Salisbury, and had the best view feasible of all the pageants and diversions of autumn. She saw some magnificent processions of clergy, she was welcomed at a civic banquet and drank of the loving cup, and she beheld the Lord Mayor's Show in all its picturesque glory of emblazoned barges on the river. In fact, she found the position of denizen of an alderman's household so very agreeable that she did her best to make it a permanency. Nay, Dennet soon found that she considered herself to be waiting there and keeping guard till her son's return should establish her there, and that she viewed the girl already as a daughter--for which Dennet was by no means obliged to her! She lavished counsel on her hostess, found fault with the maidens, criticised the cookery, <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> and still- room with assistance and directions, and even made a strong effort to possess herself of the keys.|$|E
50|$|Guests next {{walked into}} a new room which was a model of Aunt Meg's damaged house after the twister. As guests <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> {{televisions}} are seen impaled into the wall, as if by tremendous force. Paxton and Hunt appear on the televisions {{and talk about what}} is ahead. The moment they finish, the televisions started to static, and after the static, the channel changes to Channel 5, with a weather anchor issuing a tornado warning in the area the guests are in. They are finally led onto a set resembling the drive-in theater scene in the movie.|$|E
6000|$|... "That custom {{has fallen}} away a little, sir; though the nigger comes much the oftenest. He {{is sure to}} be here once or twice a week, in good weather. Then he <b>walks</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> where he will sit {{sometimes}} for a whole morning telling the hardest stories, sir--ha, ha, ha!--yes, sir, just the hardest stories one ever heard!" ...|$|R
60|$|Then Mr. Fenwick got down, and <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> spacious <b>kitchen,</b> {{where he}} was cordially welcomed by the stout {{mistress}} of Startup Farm.|$|R
60|$|At {{ten o'clock}} he awoke and dressed himself. He <b>walked</b> out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> {{where he found}} his mother with a frightened {{expression}} on her face.|$|R
50|$|Final Challenge: In the challenge, the finalists are {{tasked with}} {{preparing}} a four-course meal {{that is their}} biography. The first course is their first cooking memory. The second course is the meal that encouraged them to become a chef. The third course is the food that represents their first restaurant. And the fourth course represents who they are now, and who they want to become. There are two twists in this episode. Twist One was that the diners include the Top Chefs from the previous five seasons (Harold Dieterle, Ilan Hall, Hung Huynh, Stephanie Izard, and Hosea Rosenberg), as well as Padma Lakshmi, Tom Colicchio, and Gail Simmons. Since there was no quick-fire, the diners score counts for 25% of the total. Twist Two was that a video appeared of the sous chefs {{of each of the}} finalists appearing, and wishing them good luck. This definitely lifted spirits of each of the finalists. Then the sous chefs <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> to help their respective bosses.|$|E
5000|$|The {{leading role}} {{is played by}} Christopher Timothy. Simon Ward (who had played the part in the 1975 film), John Alderton (who had {{replaced}} Ward in the sequel, It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet) and Richard Beckinsale all turned down the role. Bill Sellars had {{wanted to give the}} role to Timothy from the outset, but the powers that be wanted to cast the role. Sellars, therefore, asked Timothy if he would accept the role of Tristan Farnon. [...] "I had a wife, I had children, I had a mortgage to pay, and I wasn't working. So I said, 'No. It's Herriot or nothing.'" [...] Timothy put everything on the line. [...] "I got home one night, at about 9 o'clock. My wife was washing up in the kitchen. I <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> and she said, without turning round, 'You've got the Herriot part.'" [...] Timothy also stated that, after all of the roles had been cast except that of Herriot, one of the directors said, [...] "Why don't we give Herriot part to Christopher Timothy and make him a name?" [...] In 2003, Timothy said that Alf Wight wrote him a letter after the series started, saying [...] "You are the Herriot I wrote about".|$|E
5000|$|Will was {{revealed}} {{as a child}} genius by Gilly Roach (Anthony Quinlan) as he was a contestant on Countdown at 15 years old and seen as a child prodigy. He was also fast-tracked into Oxford University at 16 but dropped out due to complications. Now at HCC with a second chance, Will is extremely moody and keeps himself to himself but has developed obsessive feelings for Zoe Carpenter (Zoë Lister). He tried to win her affection but she turned him down; he has since tried more devious means of winning her praise by trying to sabotage her new relationship with Zak Ramsey (Kent Riley). When Zak and Zoe made up, Will broke into her bedroom and hid some of her possessions. He framed Zak for this, causing Zoe to dump Zak. Will then [...] "bugged" [...] Zoe's bedroom, but saw more than he bargained for when Zoe rekindled her new-found interest in nudism with flatmate Kris Fisher (Gerard McCarthy). Zak flirts with Zoe and they got cosy. Zak <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> where Will was cooking something on the stove. Zak bent down to {{get something out of}} the cupboard, so Will twisted the handle round. Zak stood up and the food went flying, burning Zak's arm.|$|E
50|$|The opening {{sequence}} {{from the}} second series carry on <b>into</b> <b>the</b> third series but with a few changes, instead of Tilly opening the door when the door opens it's Gordon, Holly, Megan and Tana all saying I'm Matilda over and over until Tilly appears from behind and <b>walks</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> (Jack doesn't make an appearance in the third series titles apart from a 5 second link of him on Tilly's Ipad). Clips from the third series are also shown.|$|R
5000|$|In the 2015 film Goosebumps, {{based on}} the children's book series of the same name, Jillian Bell's {{character}} <b>walks</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> of her sister and nephew's new house, who have just moved to Delaware from New York, and greets them [...] "Live from New York, it's my sister Gale with special guest my nephew Zach!". Bell had previously auditioned for SNL and though she did not join the cast, she became {{a writer for the}} show for the thirty-fifth season.|$|R
60|$|Her father hesitated {{and glared}} at the servant, who, with her head bound up in a duster, passed at the double with a broom. Then he <b>walked</b> slowly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b>|$|R
40|$|In lieu of an abstract, {{below is}} the essay 2 ̆ 7 s first paragraph. 2 ̆ 2 When Emily <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> {{blinking}} against sleep and still fastening {{the buttons on}} her uniform, her mother was already clearing cupboard space for the new dishes.

50|$|His wife is {{horrified by}} his {{appearance}} and briefly tends to his wounds. He is catatonic and hallucinates {{in front of}} the TV. Eventually, he reloads the gun and prepares to kill himself, but another hallucination reminds him of his purpose for returning home. Frankie <b>walks</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> bedroom, tells his wife that he loves her, and then shoots her in the stomach. As she lies on the ground, he shoots her three more times, yelling at her to die. He shoots the baby once and then picks it up from the crib. He cradles it and <b>walks</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> with it.|$|R
50|$|The {{four of them}} go to the {{bar where}} Jenny was {{allegedly}} conceived, where she convinces a waitress (Lilah Richcreek) to come with them back to Walden's house. Walden feels grateful for this supposedly kind action, {{but it turns out}} that she picked her up for herself, since she is actually a lesbian, and leads the waitress to have sex in Walden's bedroom. The next morning, Walden bitterly enters <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> complaining to Alan about Jenny forcing him to sleep in the guest room. Jenny and <b>the</b> waitress then <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> barely dressed, which arouses Walden.|$|R
5000|$|It wasn't {{unusual to}} <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Sanders' <b>kitchen</b> in broad {{daylight}} to find a full materialisation séance in progress. Mrs. Sanders would be carrying on with the chores regardless of the apparitions in attendance.|$|R

50|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} was {{directed}} by Randee St. Nicholas, and was released to CMT on July 16, 2009. The video begins with Lambert {{sitting at a table}} with a vase of dead flowers. She gets up and <b>walks</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> where Christmas lights are lying, strung across the counter. Lambert is then shown performing in the living room with fans blowing on her hair, while a man is watching from the sofa beside her. After that, she is shown outside the house, both in and in front of her car, with more holiday lights hung up on her house.|$|R
50|$|Ella {{enters and}} she and Weston discuss Emma’s {{shooting}} up of the club. Weston is proud of Emma, saying that it takes guts {{to do something like}} that at her age. Ella begins to yell at Weston for pulling a Jekyll and Hyde act by changing overnight. He tells her it was the night’s sleep on the table that fixed everything. Ella pushes all the laundry to the floor and lies on the table. As she is falling asleep, and Weston is talking to her about the benefits of sleeping on the hard table, Wesley <b>walks</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> naked, and takes the lamb outside.|$|R
50|$|Both Franklin and Holland {{wanted the}} film to be a tribute to Alfred Hitchcock and the {{original}} film. To accomplish this, they added various in-jokes such as the scene when Mary and Norman first go into Norman's mother's room, before they turn the lights on, Alfred Hitchcock's silhouette is visible on the wall to the far right. Franklin also repeated various shots from the original film such as the shot where Norman <b>walks</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> and sets his jacket down on the chair. The final pages of the shooting script were not distributed to cast and crew until {{the last day of}} filming.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Simpson {{gazed at}} her fixedly, and then, with an {{impatient}} exclamation, <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> small <b>kitchen</b> and began to set the supper. A joint of cold beef, a jar of pickles, bread, butter, and cheese made an appetizing display. Then he took a jug from the dresser and descended to the cellar.|$|R
5000|$|The {{next morning}} before 10:00, Woody takes {{a cab to}} the crime scene. He makes his way <b>into</b> <b>the</b> woods, where a {{flashback}} reveals that he buried some money made from the drug deal under a tree. Woody takes the money and drives off in Vincent's car, symbolizing that Woody has decided to become his own man. Back at home, his grandmother <b>walks</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> where she finds money left by Woody in her Bible. As Woody drives off (presumably to North Carolina), in voice-over form, Woody says [...] "My Uncle Vincent said that they {{are two types of}} people: owners and renters.

60|$|He unhitched {{the colt}} himself, {{while his father}} trembled by with bent knees; he clapped the colt on the haunch and started him through the pasture-bars with a gay shout, and then put his arm round Clementina's waist, and <b>walked</b> her <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> amidst <b>the</b> grins {{of his mother and}} sisters, who said he ought to be ashamed.|$|R
50|$|Dennis and Kristi leave <b>the</b> {{closet and}} <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> In <b>the</b> window, Dennis sees the women {{outside in the}} garden, {{circling}} around a bonfire.

Lois then beckons to Kristi and Katie and, after they start going upstairs, Lois tells them to get ready. Before they head upstairs, Kristi calls for Toby when they leave the camera lying on the floor. And then, it goes to static and black after low growling sounds are heard from upstairs.|$|R
