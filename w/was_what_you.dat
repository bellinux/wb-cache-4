500|$|During one scene, a {{frustrated}} Tom Cruise angrily {{jumps up and}} down on a couch while Oprah Winfrey sits next to him. This is a reference to an incident on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 2005, in which Cruise repeatedly jumped on the couch next to Oprah, fell to one knee and loudly professed his love for actress Katie Holmes. Cruise has been repeatedly mocked for his behavior. In another scene, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg are shown to have actor Harrison Ford leashed, chained and ball-gagged, as the actor wears the fedora he wore in the Indiana Jones films. This is a reference to the twelfth season episode [...] "The China Probrem", in which Lucas and Spielberg literally rape Indiana Jones repeatedly, which served as a commentary by Parker and Stone for the poor quality of the 2008 Spielberg/Lucas film, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. A cartoon image of film director Tim Burton is featured in the episode, despite having not been previously ridiculed by the show. In the episode, Burton is mocked for not having an original idea since the 1988 comedy horror film Beetlejuice, and for his tendency to feature film actor Johnny Depp in so many of his films that he should [...] "just have sex with him [...] already". Cartman's Jennifer Lopez hand-puppet repeatedly demands food from the American restaurant chain Taco Bell, particularly enchiritos, {{which is one of the}} many Hispanic stereotypes utilized by the character. [...] Also, when the celebrities are discussing who to bring in to help capture Mohammed, Barbra Streisand is referenced as [...] "her," [...] to which the discussion goes [...] "her who?" [...] "her" [...] "oh...her." [...] This is slightly reminiscent of the movie Little Shop of Horrors when Rick Moranis and Steve Martin are talking about Audrey, who the dentist had physically abused, where Steve asks [...] "what did I ever do to you" [...] and Rick answers [...] "it wasn't what you did to me, it <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> did to her" [...] Steve: [...] "her? oh...her" ...|$|E

2500|$|The cricket correspondent, Colin Bateman, remarked, [...] "Graham Roope was one {{of those}} cricketers who thrilled spectators and {{frustrated}} selectors. Tall and stylish, there was a touch of class about his middle-order batting. He could make the ball swing at medium pace and his slip fielding <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> would expect from a Corinthian Casuals goalkeeper". Bateman added [...] "as a former selector said: 'He looked the part – but never played it'".|$|E

2500|$|Author Phillip Evans said in 2014 that [...] "Henderson's central idea <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> {{might call}} the Napoleonic idea of concentrating mass against weakness, of {{overwhelming}} the enemy. What Henderson recognized was that, in the business world, there are many phenomena which are characterized by what economists would call increasing returns—scale, experience. The more you do of something, disproportionately the better you get. And therefore he found a logic for investing in such kinds of overwhelming mass {{in order to achieve}} competitive advantage. And that was the first introduction of essentially a military concept of strategy into the business world. ... It was on those two ideas, Henderson's idea of increasing returns to scale and experience, and Porter's idea of the value chain, encompassing heterogenous elements, that the whole edifice of business strategy was subsequently erected." ...|$|E
2500|$|Remarking on Eysenck's alleged right-wing connections, Buchanan writes: [...] "For {{those looking}} to {{thoroughly}} demonize Eysenck, his links with far right groups revealed his true political sympathies." [...] According to Buchanan, these harsh critics interpreted Eysenck's writings as [...] "overtly racist". Furthermore, Buchanan writes that Eysenck's fiercest critics {{were convinced that}} Eysenck was [...] "willfully misrepresenting a dark political agenda". Buchanan footnotes this observation with an emotive, derogatory quote from William Tucker who described Eysenck as [...] "Jensen's dark doppelganger." [...] Buchanan, however, disagrees with this stark interpretation: [...] "Yet the tip-of-the-iceberg metaphor implicit in this accusation appears to be seriously misleading in Eysenck's case. More than most, what you saw <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> got. He spread himself too thin to be harbouring much beneath the surface." [...] Buchanan goes on to argue that Eysenck's research was thinly spread across numerous domains to conclude that [...] "There appeared to be no hidden agenda to Hans Eysenck. He was too self-absorbed, too preoccupied with his own aspirations as a great scientist to harbor specific political aims." ...|$|E
