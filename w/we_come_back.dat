25|$|Any {{family of}} sets that {{satisfies}} (2–4) is called a filter (an example: the complements to the finite sets, {{it is called the}} Fréchet filter and it is used in the usual limit theory). If (1) also holds, U is called an ultrafilter (because you can add no more sets to it without breaking it). The only explicitly known example of an ultrafilter is the {{family of sets}} containing a given element (in our case, say, the number 10). Such ultrafilters are called trivial, and if we use it in our construction, <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> to the ordinary real numbers. Any ultrafilter containing a finite set is trivial. It is known that any filter can be extended to an ultrafilter, but the proof uses the axiom of choice. The existence of a nontrivial ultrafilter (the ultrafilter lemma) can be added as an extra axiom, as it is weaker than the axiom of choice.|$|E
500|$|Both in his {{two terms}} as {{governor}} and during his 1980 run for the presidency, Reagan was introduced with the pop americana standard, [...] "California Here I Come". The song was reworked into a jingle for the candidate opening with, [...] "California, here <b>we</b> <b>come,</b> <b>back</b> where Reagan started from. In 1998 folksinger Oscar Brand recorded this version, along with other presidential campaign songs, for a collection released by Smithsonian Folkways.|$|E
500|$|The still-incomplete tower became New York City's tallest {{building}} by roof height in April 2012, passing the [...] roof {{height of the}} Empire State Building. President Barack Obama visited the construction site two months later and wrote, on a steel beam that would be hoisted {{to the top of}} the tower, the sentence [...] "We remember, we rebuild, <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> stronger!" [...] That same month, with the tower's structure nearing completion, the owners of the building began a public marketing campaign for the building, seeking to attract visitors and tenants.|$|E

500|$|As Frances Cleveland {{left the}} White House, {{she told a}} staff member, [...] "Now, Jerry, I {{want you to take}} good care of all the {{furniture}} and ornaments in the house, for I want to find everything just as it is now, when <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> again." [...] When asked when she would return, she responded, [...] "We are coming back four years from today." [...] In the meantime, the Clevelands moved to New York City where Cleveland took a position with the law firm of Bangs, Stetson, Tracy, and MacVeigh. This affiliation was more of an office sharing arrangement, though quite compatible. Cleveland's law practice brought only a moderate income, perhaps because Cleveland spent considerable time at the couple's vacation home Gray Gables at Buzzard Bay, where fishing became his obsession. While they lived in New York, the Clevelands' first child, Ruth, was born in 1891.|$|E
500|$|The {{comeback}} {{was confirmed}} when Girls Aloud's official website posted on 9 October a countdown {{that would last}} until 19 October, when the girls would make a special announcement. It was speculated that they would make an appearance on BBC's Strictly Come Dancing, where bandmate Kimberley Walsh joined as a contestant. However, on 15 October, the surprise, a single titled [...] "Something New", leaked online in full. The official radio premiere of the song was then brought forward to the following day, with Girls Aloud posting on their website, [...] "It's here! The finished version of Something New will be played on radio from midday and will also be on YouTube to listen in full." [...] "Something New" [...] was released on 16 November 2012 by Polydor Records through digital download, serving as the official Children in Need 2012 single. When asked about how she felt with the group being back together and the reception from the public, Walsh said, [...] "I'm kind of flattered people actually care if <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> or not. I think we are all quite proud that we made enough of an impact {{to be able to}} a comeback." ...|$|E
500|$|During editing, Tarantino and Rodriguez came up {{with the}} idea of {{inserting}} [...] "missing reels" [...] into the film. [...] " [...] was about to show an Italian crime movie with Oliver Reed," [...] Rodriguez recalls, [...] "and he was saying, 'Oh, it's got a missing reel in it. But it's really interesting because after the missing reel, you don't know if he slept with a girl or he didn't because she says he did and he says that he didn't. It leaves you guessing, and the movie still works with 20 minutes gone out of it.' I thought, 'Oh, my God, that's what we’ve got to do. We've got to have a missing reel!' I'm going to use it in a way where it actually says 'missing reel' for 10 seconds, and then when <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>back,</b> you're arriving in the third act. [...] The late second acts in movies are usually the most predictable and the most boring, that's where the good guy really turns out to be the bad guy, and the bad guy is really good, and the couple becomes friends. Suddenly, though, in the third act, all bets are off and it's a whole new story anyway." ...|$|E

500|$|The Big Lebowski {{was written}} {{around the same}} time as Barton Fink. When the Coen {{brothers}} wanted to make it, John Goodman was filming episodes for the Roseanne television program and Jeff Bridges was making the Walter Hill film Wild Bill. The Coens decided to make Fargo in the meantime. According to Ethan, [...] "the movie was conceived as pivoting around that relationship between the Dude and Walter", which sprang from the scenes between Barton Fink and Charlie Meadows in Barton Fink. They also {{came up with the idea}} of setting the film in contemporary L.A., because the people who inspired the story lived in the area. When Pete Exline told them about the homework in a baggie incident, the Coens thought that that was very Raymond Chandler and decided to integrate elements of the author's fiction into their script. Joel Coen cites Robert Altman's The Long Goodbye as a primary influence on their film, in the sense that The Big Lebowski [...] "is just kind of informed by Chandler around the edges". When they started writing the script, the Coens wrote only 40 pages and then let it sit for a while before finishing it. This is a normal writing process for them, because they often [...] "encounter a problem at a certain stage, we pass to another project, then <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> to the first script. That way we've already accumulated pieces for several future movies." [...] In order to liven up a scene that they thought was too heavy on exposition, they added an [...] "effete art-world hanger-on", known as Knox Harrington, late in the screenwriting process. In the original script, the Dude's car was a Chrysler LeBaron, as Dowd had once owned, but that car was not big enough to fit John Goodman so the Coens changed it to a Ford Torino.|$|E

[...] "I {{think it}} is {{definitely}} good for when <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> here in September but past success doesn't guarantee future success," [...] he said. [...] "We have to keep working and plugging away. I am {{sure a lot of}} guys will be stronger and hopefully we will be too." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1974, Queen attended, {{and were}} {{initially}} booed during their set to screams of [...] "go back to Pommyland, ya pooftahs". Lead singer, Freddie Mercury retorted, [...] "When <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> to Australia, Queen {{will be the}} biggest band in the world!" [...] The early version of Skyhooks were also booed and, after watching a recording of their performance, lead singer Steve Hill quit and was replaced by Graeme [...] "Shirley" [...] Strachan.|$|E

2500|$|In 2015, a {{children}} performed a song at a kindergarten graduation ceremony in the West Bank which included these lyrics: [...] "If you stretch your hand, {{it will be}} chopped off. If you just look with your eye, it will be gouged out. ... We come for you before, and woe betide you if <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> again. You come to this land alive, but you will leave it as body part." [...] Yasser Arafat's image accompanied the children on stage as they carried toy guns and wore uniforms. A woman's charity sponsored the ceremony.|$|E
2500|$|This was {{the first}} {{appearance}} in Australia of UK band Queen. Many sources claim that Queen were booed off stage. In May 2009, on Spicks and Specks, Daddy Cool front man Ross Wilson disputed this as an urban legend and said Queen finished their set, even doing an encore. Lead singer, Freddie Mercury bravely told the audience [...] "When <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> to Australia, Queen {{will be the biggest}} band in the world!" [...] Queen returned to Australia to perform again in 1976 at the height of their fame. The early version of Australian group Skyhooks were also booed and, after watching a TV broadcast of their performance, lead singer Steve Hill quit the band and was replaced by Graeme [...] "Shirley" [...] Strachan.|$|E

2500|$|Saladin {{proceeded}} to take Nusaybin which offered no resistance. A medium-sized town, Nusaybin {{was not of}} great importance, but it was located in a strategic position between Mardin and Mosul and within easy reach of Diyarbakir. In the midst of these victories, Saladin received word that the Crusaders were raiding the villages of Damascus. He replied [...] "Let them... whilst they knock down villages, we are taking cities; when <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>back,</b> we shall have all the more strength to fight them." [...] Meanwhile, in Aleppo, the emir of the city Zangi raided Saladin's cities {{to the north and}} east, such as Balis, Manbij, Saruj, Buza'a, al-Karzain. He also destroyed his own citadel at A'zaz to prevent it from being used by the Ayyubids if they were to conquer it.|$|E
2500|$|His {{first major}} Drama was “The Old Master” by Donald Campbell, {{in a story}} {{featuring}} Andrew Keir celebrating his 100th birthday. John Welsh and Rowena Cooper were also in it. He had continued to direct episodes of Take the High Road well into 1985, but still found {{time to make a}} series for new writers called Preview. The titles included Should <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> to-morrow (with Maurice Roeves) by James Graham and Midnight Feast (with Robert Addie) by Michael Wilcox. [...] It told the story of [...] "wo public schoolboys [...] gain access to the housemaster's personal files during a midnight feast". Previously he had made a series for schools called Scot's History. [...] In the one featuring Bonnie Price Charlie's retreat at Derby, the title role was played by a young Alan Rickman in one of his first TV appearances.|$|E
2500|$|United Kingdom artists, Queen {{performed}} in 1974 and initially were booed, they finished their set despite crowd screams of [...] "go back to Pommyland, ya pooftahs". Lead singer, Freddie Mercury retorted with [...] "When <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> to Australia, Queen {{will be the}} biggest band in the world!". A fledgling Skyhooks were also booed and returned the following year with a new lead singer, Graeme [...] "Shirley" [...] Strachan. In 1975 another UK band, Deep Purple were head-liners. A fracas developed on-stage between Deep Purple's roadies and AC/DC's roadies and members. Due to poor weather and high ticket prices the attendance was down to 16,000. Odessa Promotions was liquidated after paying out Deep Purple but most local acts were not paid by Odessa. Late in the year, Deep Purple placed money into a fund so that unpaid artists were paid at the full musician's rate.|$|E

2500|$|The show's pilot {{episode is}} told almost entirely in retroversions to three {{different}} time frames. According to Nick Wauters, the show's creator, later episodes would use flashbacks more {{to develop the}} characters. [...] "There will be big reveals and big clues in each episode," [...] he said, promising that viewers {{would not have to}} wait too long for answers to questions raised. After the pilot aired, he and executive producer Steve Stark answered some viewer questions on their Twitter feeds, one being the fate of the plane used in the assassination attempt, which ended up disappearing through a portal before it could crash. The characters also have Twitter feeds, and one had a blog, truthseeker5314.com, which would reveal additional information. The last two episodes before and all episodes following the show's hiatus no longer featured flashbacks. Cast member Blair Underwood said regarding the removal of the flashbacks, [...] "We had been jumping around a lot and doing flashbacks and that was confusing to people," [...] and [...] "So when <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>back,</b> that device is done with! We are now telling the story straight through so people can track it and follow it easier." ...|$|E
