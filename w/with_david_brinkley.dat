500|$|Jennings' {{debut on}} September 5, 1983, marked the {{beginning}} of a steady climb in the ratings for ABC News. He spent his first year at the anchor desk educating himself on American domestic affairs in preparation for the 1984 presidential campaign season. In June 1984, Jennings, who later admitted that his political knowledge was limited at the time, co-anchored ABC's coverage of the Democratic National Convention <b>with</b> <b>David</b> <b>Brinkley.</b> [...] "I had not covered an election campaign in 16 years," [...] Jennings said, [...] "so here was I going to co-anchor <b>with</b> <b>David</b> <b>Brinkley</b> in 1984, and he wasn't even sure I knew who the faces belonged to, and he was right." [...] Jennings and ABC were criticized for suddenly halting coverage of the convention for 30 minutes and airing a rerun of Hart to Hart instead.|$|E

500|$|On the {{subsequent}} Born in the U.S.A. Tour, Springsteen generally interspersed hard-rocking song sequences after {{every three or}} four numbers in order to give Weinberg's hands a chance to recover. Weinberg's wife Becky unintentionally triggered one of the tour's most celebrated episodes. She was a fan of the This Week <b>with</b> <b>David</b> <b>Brinkley</b> television program and invited panelist George Will to the Washington-area Capital Centre show. After seeing the band perform, Will became convinced that they were exemplars of hard-working patriotism and traditional American values; he wrote, [...] "... consider Max Weinberg's bandaged fingers. [...] The rigors of drumming have led to five tendonitis operations. He soaks his hands in hot water before a concert, in ice afterward, and sleeps with tight gloves on." [...] Will further decided that Springsteen might endorse Ronald Reagan in the 1984 presidential campaign and talked to the campaign, which later led to Reagan's famous extolling of Springsteen at a stop in Hammonton, New Jersey and Springsteen's subsequent negative response.|$|E
