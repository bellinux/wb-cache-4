5|$|Persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany {{followed}} the Nazi takeover. Hitler {{moved quickly to}} eliminate political Catholicism, rounding up functionaries of the Catholic-aligned Bavarian People's Party and Catholic Centre Party, which along with all other non-Nazi political parties ceased to exist by July. The Reichskonkordat (Reich Concordat) treaty with the Vatican was signed in 1933, amid continuing harassment {{of the church in}} Germany. The treaty required the regime to honour the independence of Catholic institutions and prohibited clergy from involvement in politics. Hitler routinely disregarded the Concordat, closing all Catholic institutions whose functions were not strictly religious. Clergy, nuns and lay leaders <b>were</b> <b>targeted,</b> with thousands of arrests over the ensuing years, often on trumped-up charges of currency smuggling or immorality. Several high-profile Catholic lay leaders <b>were</b> <b>targeted</b> in the 1934 Night of the Long Knives assassinations. Most Catholic youth groups refused to dissolve themselves and Hitler Youth leader Baldur von Schirach encouraged members to attack Catholic boys in the streets. Propaganda campaigns claimed the church was corrupt, restrictions were placed on public meetings and Catholic publications faced censorship. Catholic schools were required to reduce religious instruction and crucifixes were removed from state buildings.|$|E

5|$|As part {{of their}} program to {{suppress}} Polish culture, the German Nazis attempted to destroy Christianity in Poland, with a particular emphasis on the Roman Catholic Church.

The worst conditions {{were found in the}} Reichsgau Wartheland, which the Nazis treated as a laboratory for their anti-religious policies. Polish clergy and religious leaders figured prominently among portions of the intelligentsia that <b>were</b> <b>targeted</b> for extermination.|$|E

5|$|Established {{during the}} revival of the Indies film industry, Oriental {{released}} its first film, Kris Mataram, in July 1940.

The company's productions <b>were</b> <b>targeted</b> at low-income audiences and extensively used kroncong music, for the recording of which the company established the Oriental Novelty Five.

According to him, all were blessed with this tool, but very few used it. Thus Periyar used reasoning, with respect to subjects of social interest, in his presentations to his audiences. Communal differences in Tamil society were {{considered by many to}} be deep-rooted features until Periyar came to the scene.|$|E
