5|$|Chesbro {{announced}} he would work on keeping his <b>weight</b> <b>down</b> prior to the 1907 season, but announced his intentions to retire in February 1907. In March 1907, he {{announced he}} would return, but not at a pay cut. He signed a new contract two weeks into the 1907 season, in which he went 10–10.|$|E
5|$|After {{examining}} {{the practice of}} other British railways, Richard Maunsell, the Chief Mechanical Engineer, secured agreement for a 4-cylinder design, with an improved boiler and Belpaire firebox. The drive would be divided between the front coupled axle for the inside cylinders and the middle coupled axle for the outside cylinders giving better weight distribution and reduced hammer blow. The new design was an inevitable compromise between {{the need for additional}} power and to keep the <b>weight</b> <b>down</b> to an acceptable limit.|$|E

25|$|Designed by Alvis in the 1960s, the CVR(T) family {{includes}} Scorpion and Scimitar light reconnaissance tanks, Spartan armoured {{personnel carriers}} (APC)s, Sultan {{command and control}} vehicle, Samaritan armoured ambulance, Striker anti–tank guided missile vehicle and Samson armoured recovery vehicle. All members of the CVR(T) family were designed to share common automotive components and suspension; aluminium armour was selected to keep the <b>weight</b> <b>down.</b> By 1996, more than 3,500 had been built for British Army use and export.|$|E
25|$|Disc brakes {{were most}} popular on sports cars {{when they were}} first introduced, since these {{vehicles}} are more demanding about brake performance. Discs have now become the more common form in most passenger vehicles, although many (particularly light weight vehicles) use drum brakes on the rear wheels to keep costs and <b>weight</b> <b>down</b> as well as to simplify the provisions for a parking brake. As the front brakes perform most of the braking effort, this can be a reasonable compromise.|$|E
25|$|In 1927 a {{new owner}} {{refitted}} {{it with a}} 32hp (24kW) Bristol Cherub III flat twin engine, a larger rudder, and a more conventional undercarriage with larger wheels mounted on a cross axle attached to the lower fuselage {{with a pair of}} V-struts. In 1931 another new owner fitted a heavier 30hp (22kW) ABC Scorpion engine, another flat twin and, to keep the <b>weight</b> <b>down,</b> reworked it as a single seater. It was in this condition when it was acquired by Richard Shuttleworth in about 1937.|$|E

25|$|In 1990, Irwin {{completed}} Rosebud, Garcia's fourth custom guitar. It {{was similar}} to his previous guitar Tiger in many respects, but featured different inlays and electronics, tone and volume controls, and weight. Rosebud, unlike Tiger, was configured with three humbuckers; the neck and bridge pickups shared a tone control, while the middle had its own. Atop the guitar was a Roland GK-2 pickup which fed the controller set inside the guitar. The GK2 was used in junction with the Roland GR-50 rack mount synthesizer. The GR-50 synthesizer in turn drove a Korg M1R synthesizer producing the MIDI effects heard during live performances of this period as heard on the Grateful Dead recording Without a Net. Sections of the guitar were hollowed out to bring the <b>weight</b> <b>down</b> to 11½ pounds. The inlay, a dancing skeleton holding a rose, covers a plate just below the bridge. The final cost of the instrument was $11,000.|$|E
500|$|However, after Cody had his <b>weight</b> <b>down</b> to , {{a number}} of schools offered him scholarships, {{including}} Tennessee, Ole Miss, and Florida State. He was heavily recruited particularly by Alabama Crimson Tide head coach Nick Saban, who {{was in need of}} a true nose tackle for his 3–4 defense. Cody recalls Saban telling him, [...] "We need a body like yours in the middle, to stop the run, to change the rhythm of the game." ...|$|E

50|$|One {{form of the}} Cajun dance {{features}} stepping or walking, {{in time to the}} music, with alternating feet. In {{an exaggerated}} form, most often seen in newer dancers, this resembles a “hobble step”, as if stepping on and off a curb. In reality, it is a subtle <b>weighting</b> <b>down</b> of one foot/leg (right for men, left for woman) which allows the opposite leg to move about. The effect is to facilitate turns and swings reminiscent of jitterbug and swing dancing, or versions of Country Western dancing.|$|R

25|$|The 38th BG {{returned}} to Yontan from Morotai on 26 September, having lost three additional B-25s to accidents. On 1 October the group transferred out all aircraft {{with more than}} 600 hours of flight time, which reduced it to nine B-25s. Okinawa was struck by typhoons on 16 September and 9 October, the latter destroying all tents and structures in the 38th's camp at Yontan, but the bombers were saved by <b>weighting</b> <b>down</b> their wings with sandbags and using full engine power to keep them turned into the wind.|$|R
500|$|The {{suspension}} {{was entirely}} new, adding adjustable anti-roll bars. [...] The brakes were redesigned {{to adapt the}} use of a driver-adjustable brake pressure balance, while the servo-activated braking system was removed. [...] A racing steering rack was used in place of the standard power steering unit. [...] Pneumatic jacks were later added to the cars in the 1980 season to allow for quicker pit stops. [...] Goodyear racing tires were used on all cars. [...] All other non-essential items from the road car were not included, bringing the Procar M1's <b>weight</b> <b>down</b> to [...] [...] The performance of the Procar M1s was increased to a top speed of [...] dependent upon gear ratios, and acceleration from 0– in 4.3seconds. [...] Each Procar M1 cost approximately US$60,000.|$|E
500|$|The {{cause of}} Terri Schiavo's {{collapse}} {{was determined to}} be cardiac arrest. Her medical chart contained a note that [...] "she apparently has been trying to keep her <b>weight</b> <b>down</b> with dieting by herself, drinking liquids most of the time during the day and drinking about 10–15 glasses of iced tea." [...] Upon admission to the hospital, she was noted as suffering from hypokalemia (low potassium levels): her serum potassium level was an abnormally low 2.0mEq/L (the normal range for adults is 3.5–5.0mEq/L). Her sodium and calcium levels were normal. Electrolyte imbalance is often caused by drinking excessive fluids. A serious consequence of hypokalemia can be heart rhythm abnormalities, including sudden arrhythmia death syndrome. Terri was eventually switched from being fed by a nasogastric feeding tube to a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding tube.|$|E
500|$|Gordon {{was again}} arrested on 13 January 2004. Police {{said at the}} time that the murder file had never been closed, and that the arrest {{followed}} new leads. These new leads were later reported to be a confession by Michael Wainwright, who claimed to have been a cellmate of Gordon's during his short prison stay in 1997. The police then revisited the site where the body was discovered, and found a piece of Westmorland green slate, a stone that matched the rocks that made up the wall of the family's bungalow. The case was brought to trial at Manchester Crown Court, and lasted ten weeks. There was no single piece of evidence that pointed to Gordon indisputably, but the prosecution argued that when the evidence was placed together, it could only point at Park, and not a [...] "mysterious stranger or secret lover". Primarily, the case for the prosecution rested on circumstantial evidence, with the jury being asked to consider knots, rocks used to <b>weight</b> <b>down</b> the body and the ice axe, all linking Gordon Park to the crime. However, the statements of Michael Wainwright, and another of Gordon's cellmates, who had learning difficulties, were also used as evidence by the prosecution. He was sentenced to be jailed for life, and told that he must serve at least 15 years. The judge said that he had taken into account the [...] "terrible concealment" [...] of the body.|$|E

2500|$|The City Turbo {{shared the}} 1231 cc (1.2L) CVCC [...] "ER" [...] engine with its more {{pedestrian}} siblings, but {{the addition of}} a turbocharger meant that [...] at 5,500rpm and [...] at 3,000rpm were available. Further changes to the engine included an aluminum/titanium alloy head and a magnesium valve cover to keep the <b>weight</b> <b>down.</b> The IHI RHB51 turbocharger, developed as a joint venture between Ishikawajima Heavy Industry and Honda, was lighter and smaller than most other turbos and could run at higher rpm. When combined with Honda's PGM-FI fuel injection and an 8-bit digital computer control unit, the end result was a very efficient engine with minimal turbo lag. 0–100km/h was possible in 8.6 seconds.|$|E
