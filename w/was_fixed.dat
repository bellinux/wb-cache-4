In August 2004, the power system of the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) failed, rendering the instrument inoperable. The electronics had originally been fully redundant, but {{the first set of}} electronics failed in May 2001. This power supply <b>was</b> <b>fixed</b> during Servicing Mission 4 in May 2009.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} shown that a small but {{significant}} loss in length occurs in human muscles which <b>are</b> <b>fixed</b> after removal from the skeleton. A comparison was made between the loss in muscle length when muscles <b>were</b> <b>fixed</b> in isolation from, and whilst still attached to, the skeleton in the rat. The conclusion was that no significant loss of length occurs when the muscles <b>were</b> <b>fixed</b> intact on the skeleton. Since the length loss when muscles <b>are</b> <b>fixed</b> independently of the skeleton in both the rat and the human is of the same order, {{it is reasonable to assume}} that when human muscles <b>are</b> <b>fixed</b> on the skeleton, no significant loss in length occurs. Since all human cadaveric tissue <b>is</b> <b>fixed</b> whilst on the skeleton, we may assume that shrinkage of the muscles in such specimens is negligible...|$|R

The maniples were further split into centuries, of 60 hastati and 20 velites, with the centurion of the hastati century commanding the velites as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{periscopes}} had two problems, {{the first}} of which was shared with the other masts. They were not streamlined; raising a periscope while moving would create enough drag and turbulence to shake the entire submarine. As with many elements of the submarine, there were disagreements as to who was responsible for the problem. It was solved by modifying the masts to redirect the water flow around them (for example, a spiral wrap <b>was</b> <b>fixed</b> around the head of each periscope).|$|E

5|$|A Chief Justice of the King's Bench was {{assisted}} {{in his work}} {{by a number of}} Justices of the King's Bench. Occasionally appointed before 1272, the number fluctuated considerably between 1 and 4; from 1522, the number <b>was</b> <b>fixed</b> at 3. Provisions for a fourth were established in 1830, and a fifth in 1868. Following the dissolution of the Court of King's Bench, the remaining Justices because Justices of the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice. Justices were originally paid £26 a year, increasing to £66 in 1361, and £100 in 1389. An ordinance of 1645 increased this to £1,000, with the salary peaking at £5,500 in 1825. As with the Chief Justice, pension arrangements were formally organised in 1799, starting at £2,000 a year and peaking at £3,500 in 1825.|$|E
5|$|After {{capturing}} Kaifeng, the Jurchens went on {{to conquer}} the rest of northern China, while the Song Chinese court fled south. They took up temporary residence at Nanjing, where a surviving prince was named Emperor Gaozong of Song in 1127. Jin forces halted at the Yangzi River, but staged continual raids south of the river until a later boundary <b>was</b> <b>fixed</b> at the Huai River further north. With the border fixed at the Huai, the Song government would promote an immigration policy of repopulating and resettling territories north of the Yangzi River, since vast tracts of vacant land between the Yangzi and Huai were open for landless peasants found in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian provinces of the south.|$|E

The print block for the whole series of the supplements was set from the beginning so the break between each edition <b>was</b> <b>fixed</b> at 48 pages, regardless of the text, and in several issues the text of a sentence or recipe is split between the end of one instalment {{and the beginning of the}} next.|$|E

5|$|At the 2013 inquest {{into the}} roof {{collapse}} (see Government reaction below), testimony {{has revealed that}} many unpublicized structural problems at the mall dated {{all the way back}} to its initial construction in the late 1970s. In particular, the expansion joint above the escalators, the failure of which appears to have caused the roof deck collapse, was already not properly binding to the concrete, in turn allowing water to seep into the building's seams, as early as 1981 — barely a year after the mall's original opening. The expansion joint <b>was</b> <b>fixed</b> many times, and fully replaced twice, during the building's lifetime, yet always began tearing away from the concrete again shortly after the repairs were complete.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as the Fleet Air Arm was {{receiving}} its first aircraft, the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment had three FG.1s delivered to its 'C' Squadron for flight deck trials aboard Eagle. Two sets of trials were successfully carried out in March and June 1969; the first comprised approaches and touch and go landings, while the second set of trials involved full catapult launch and arrested recovery. As a result of the reheat from the Spey turbofans, the ship's jet blast deflectors (JBD) were not used; instead a steel plate <b>was</b> <b>fixed</b> to the deck to absorb the heat of the engines building to launch, and fire hoses were used after each launch to prevent them melting.|$|E

5|$|Copperbelt was a {{province}} in Northern Rhodesia which was rich in deposits of the mineral. Cecil John Rhodes, a British capitalist and empire builder, {{was the leading}} light of British expansion north of the Limpopo River into south-central Africa. In 1895, Rhodes asked his American scout Frederick Russell Burnham to look for minerals and how to improve river navigation in the region; during this trek, Burnham discovered large copper deposits along the Kafue River. Rhodes brought British influence into the region by obtaining mineral rights from local chiefs through questionable treaties. The Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1891, signed in Lisbon on 11 June 1891 by the United Kingdom and Portugal, fixed the boundary between territories administered by the British South Africa Company (BSAC) in North-Eastern Rhodesia and Portuguese Mozambique. It also fixed {{the boundary between the}} BSAC-administered territory of North-Western Rhodesia (now in Zambia) and Portuguese Angola, although the boundary with Angola was not marked on the ground until later. The northern border of the British territory in North-Eastern Rhodesia and the British Central Africa Protectorate was agreed in an 1890 Anglo-German treaty which also fixed the (very short) boundary between North-Western Rhodesia and German South-West Africa, now Namibia. The boundary between the Congo Free State and British territory <b>was</b> <b>fixed</b> by an 1894 treaty, although minor adjustments were made until the 1930s. The border between the British Central Africa Protectorate and North-Eastern Rhodesia <b>was</b> <b>fixed</b> in 1891 at the drainage divide between Lake Malawi and the Luangwa River, and the boundary between North-Western Rhodesia and Southern Rhodesia became the Zambezi River in 1898. Northern Rhodesia was under BSAC control until 1924, when it became part of the British Empire.|$|E

The precedent for this brutal repressive measure against Serbs had already been established by the Germans.

Securing the border between eastern Herzegovina and Montenegro was considered a high priority due to concerns that the Montenegrin Federalist Party had revived Montenegrin claims to parts of the NDH that had been promised to the Kingdom of Montenegro in the 1915 Treaty of London.|$|E
