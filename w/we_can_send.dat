500|$|Largely due to {{band member}} Régine Chassagne's Haitian ancestry, the band {{has tried to}} raise support and {{awareness}} for the socio-economic problems in Haiti throughout their career. The Haitian people had 15,000 dollars donated to them on November 5, 2005. On December 26, 2006, they supported Haitian charity organization Partners In Health by releasing the song [...] "Intervention" [...] on iTunes and donating the proceeds. However, they accidentally uploaded [...] "Black Wave/Bad Vibrations", the track after [...] "Intervention" [...] on Neon Bible. While the song was quickly removed once the problem was discovered, file sharers quickly circulated it on various P2P networks. On his blog, Win Butler quipped, [...] "I guess {{it is sort of}} charming that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>send</b> the wrong song to the whole world with a click of a mouse... Oh well." ...|$|E

"It's {{exciting}} that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>send</b> the Deep Impact spacecraft on a {{new mission}} that combines two totally independent science investigations, both of which can help us better understand how solar systems form and evolve," [...] said in December 2007 Deep Impact leader and University of Maryland astronomer Michael A'Hearn who is principal investigator for both the overall EPOXI mission and its DIXI component.|$|E

6000|$|... "Hoot, man, {{never mind}} the screw-nails. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> easy <b>send</b> back for it. But, wow! there's a far grander place we're comin' in sight of--an'--iss that an Indian tent I see?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll {{leave the}} luggage {{at the station}} {{and go to the}} house and see if they've got rooms, and if they have <b>we</b> <b>can</b> just <b>send</b> an outside porter for our traps." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Certainly; I would {{recommend}} your Majesty {{to get off}} at once. Myself and Manto will accompany you, and the cooks. If an order arrive to stay our departure, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> then <b>send</b> back the priests.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{this is what}} Mr. Hammond was {{in search}} of," [...] said Ned. [...] "What a pity he is gone! Perhaps <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>send</b> it after him." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Neal {{drew the}} doctor aside. [...] "A word with you," [...] he said, in German. [...] "Do you persist in asserting {{that he may}} be {{speechless}} before <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>send</b> to Stuttgart?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No need," [...] {{answered}} Buck Tom, stooping {{to pick up}} his revolver. [...] "There's another store not {{far from}} this, to which <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>send</b> to-morrow. We can get what we want there." ...|$|E
30|$|B: I don’t think so. I think Internet is good. On the Internet <b>we</b> <b>can</b> also <b>send</b> {{other through}} QQ. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> talk some topics in…er…er…like {{in the real}} life. I think Internet can give us more {{benefits}} than…er…er…yes give us more benefits.|$|R
6000|$|... "'This is a {{very clear}} case,' said the commissioner. 'Evidently he is a gentleman by birth and education, but he can give no very {{satisfactory}} account of his friends, and till they come forward to claim him <b>we</b> <b>can</b> only <b>send</b> him for a time to North Street.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very good. <b>Can</b> <b>we</b> <b>send</b> {{anything}} in to you? Fizz, for instance. Cassavetti {{is beginning to}} sing songs of the Sunny South already." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, I'll {{tell you}} what we can do!" [...] cried Gus. [...] "Take his boat with us! Then he can't get away, and <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>send</b> the {{authorities}} over here to get him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would not}} be likely," [...] he said. [...] "Still, we can talk it over. At any rate, from the Bermudas <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>send</b> a letter to your mother, and set her mind at rest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ramorny," [...] {{said the}} Prince, [...] "is {{there in the}} {{household}} any female of reputation who is fit to wait on this young woman till <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>send</b> her where she may desire to go?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes: that's {{the best}} thing <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do. We'll <b>send</b> her right back, an' take our chances on the crops. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> git enough to live on an' keep her at school, I guess." ...|$|R
5000|$|As First Lady of the United States, Laura Bush {{worked with}} Librarian of Congress James H. Billington to create the National Book Festival. [...] At {{a news conference}} announcing the inaugural festival James H. Billington said, [...] "We must all try, in every way <b>we</b> <b>can,</b> to <b>send</b> the message that reading is {{critical}} to our lives and {{to the life of}} our nation." ...|$|R
30|$|Since we {{have defined}} that the {{messages}} are {{included as a}} content in the body, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> combine the <b>sending</b> of payment information with other kinds of data such as text messages, images, etc.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do you {{see this}} girl?' said {{the lady of the}} house, {{pointing}} to Elsa. 'I wish to adopt her for my daughter. Make me a copy of her, which <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>send</b> to her native village instead of herself.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd like to {{see them}} all," [...] said Mrs. Ralston promptly. [...] "Let's just leave them here, Edward. Roger's family will have plenty of {{presents}} without them, and for that matter <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>send</b> them ours when we go back home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What's your name?" [...] and [...] "Where do you live?" [...] followed. And as Steadfast {{replied the}} old Cavalier {{took out his}} tablets and noted them, adding, [...] "Then you and your sister will be good to her till <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>send</b> after her." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Lapham {{had been}} sobered into {{something}} {{of her former}} misgiving by her difficulties with her note. [...] "Well, I don't know what TO say. I declare, I'm all mixed up about it, and I don't know as we've begun as <b>we</b> <b>can</b> carry out in promising to go. I presume," [...] she sighed, [...] "that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> all <b>send</b> some excuse at the last moment, if we don't want to go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is easily}} done. There {{has been some}} talk with the British {{authorities}} anent the security and welfare of peaceful French subjects settled in England. After {{a good deal of}} correspondence they have suggested our sending a semi-official representative over there to look after the interests of our own people commercially and financially. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> easily <b>send</b> you over in that capacity if it would suit your purpose." ...|$|R
60|$|LEMMY. But abaht Muvver, I'll tell yer 'ow <b>we</b> <b>can</b> arrynge. You <b>send</b> 'er the ten bob a week wivaht syin' anyfink, an' she'll fink {{it comes}} from Gawd or the Gover'ment yer cawn't tell one from t'other in Befnal Green.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because {{nobody but}} me knew they'd started for this place. It the men make a camp <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>send</b> back word; {{but if they}} have the least little idea that we're on their trail there'll be a mighty good chance of our getting our throats cut." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But do you {{imply that}} the grain output of Western Canada can force down prices?" [...] a man asked with a scornful laugh. [...] "We have all Europe for a market. I imagine they'll use what <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>send</b> them in a few big English towns." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{only thing}} to be done," [...] {{announced}} Mr. Watson, [...] "is to carry out these instructions faithfully. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>send</b> the cable messages from here, {{and in the morning}} Louise and I will take the train for Messina and remain there until we get the money." ...|$|E
3000|$|Multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) {{systems have}} been {{investigated}} extensively for their high spectral efficiency and reliable transmission of data [1, 2] over single-input and single-output (SISO) systems. Through multiple transmit antennas, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> transmit several independent data streams by spatial multiplexing mode. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> also <b>send</b> only one data stream by transmit beamforming or diversity modes. With spatial multiplexing, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> achieve high spectral efficiency, but the reliability of data transmission gets worse especially {{when there is a}} correlation between antennas. On the other hand, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> obtain combining gain (SNR gain) by sacrificing spectral efficiency in the beamforming mode.a [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} would. The {{government}} approves cigarettes and the French girls are supplying our boys {{across the pond}} with them even now. Surely <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do as much for our own brave laddies who are still learning the art of war. Not all smoke, of course, and some prefer pipes and tobacco, which <b>we</b> <b>can</b> also <b>send</b> them. Another thing, nearly every soldier needs a good pocket knife, and a razor, and they need games of all sorts, such as dominoes and checkers and cribbage-boards; and good honest trench mirrors, and--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Q wishes us {{to gather}} {{together}} all the capital that <b>we</b> <b>can,</b> and to <b>send</b> it across to him, in order {{that he may be}} able to organise with him a corporate association of phanograms, or perhaps in this case, one would more correctly call them phantoids." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now {{the best}} thing we can all do is to dine in St. James'-square,' said Lord Montfort. 'It is ten minutes past eight. We shall just be in time, and then <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>send</b> {{messages}} to Grosvenor-square and Brook-street. What say you, Armine? You will come, of course?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am an Englishman. Some of {{them are}} Frenchmen, but all Frenchmen are not wicked. You will see that all my friends here will be very kind to you, and will do {{everything}} they can to make you comfortable, till <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>send</b> you to your friends again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then," [...] he said, [...] "the {{only thing}} we can do is to send a valet de place for her. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>send</b> old Cazzi. He's the {{incarnation}} of respectability; five francs a day and his expenses will buy all the virtues of him. She'll come as safely with him as with me." ...|$|E
5000|$|But where <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>send</b> {{those who}} intend to devote {{themselves}} to the practical applications of science? Our country abounds in men of action.

6000|$|... "Come," [...] said Leonard to Soa, [...] "we {{have got}} enough to begin with. I must be off. You can loose the rest at your leisure; {{the moon is}} rising, it is a quarter to twelve, {{and we have not}} a moment to lose. Now, Otter, before <b>we</b> go, how <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>send</b> men to fire the reeds--through the garden?" ...|$|R
40|$|Quality {{of search}} results {{is a problem}} of search engines for the World Wide Web. Recently many sites are {{providing}} their own information with their own search engines. We call them as search sites. This paper proposes a method to integrate search sites and describes an implementation. To send queries to each site, we analyzed the attributes of the query parameters for search sites. By assembling the query URL with appropriate attribute values, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> uniformly <b>send</b> query to search sites. To compile the search result, we invented an algorithm to extract repeated tag sequence in an html file. By this algorithm, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> uniformly compile the search results into an html. Once we prepare a list of search sites for specific purpose, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> semi-automatically generate wrappers of the sites. 1...|$|R
