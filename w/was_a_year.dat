5|$|Cec Linder as Felix Leiter: Bond's CIA liaison in the United States. Linder was {{the only}} actor {{actually}} on location in Miami. Linder's interpretation of Leiter {{was that of a}} somewhat older man than the way the character was played by Jack Lord in Dr. No; in reality, Linder <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> younger than Lord. According to screenwriter Richard Maibaum, Lord demanded co-star billing, a bigger role and more money to reprise the Felix Leiter role in Goldfinger that led the producers to recast the role. At the last minute, Cec Linder switched roles with Austin Willis who played cards with Goldfinger.|$|E

5|$|DiCaprio {{was named}} Leonardo because his {{pregnant}} mother {{was looking at}} a Leonardo da Vinci painting in a museum in Italy when he first kicked.

5|$|For the People's Republic of Poland, 1956 <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> of transition. The {{international}} situation significantly weakened the hard-line Stalinist faction in Poland; Polish communist leader Bolesław Bierut died in March; {{it was three}} years since Stalin had died and his successor at the Soviet Union's helm, Nikita Khrushchev, denounced him in February. Protests by workers in June in Poznań had highlighted the people's dissatisfaction with their situation. In October, the events set in motion resulted in the rise in power of the reformers' faction, led by Władysław Gomułka. After brief, but tense, negotiations, the Soviets gave permission for Gomułka to stay in control and made several other concessions resulting in greater autonomy for the Polish government. For Polish citizens this meant a temporary liberalization. Eventually though, hopes for full liberalization were proven false, as Gomułka's regime became more oppressive. Nonetheless, the era of Stalinization in Poland had ended.|$|E

5|$|In 1895, {{at the age}} of 16, Einstein {{took the}} {{entrance}} examinations for the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zürich (later the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, ETH). He failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the examination, but obtained exceptional grades in physics and mathematics. On the advice of the principal of the Polytechnic, he attended the Argovian cantonal school (gymnasium) in Aarau, Switzerland, in 1895–96 to complete his secondary schooling. While lodging with the family of professor Jost Winteler, {{he fell in love with}} Winteler's daughter, Marie. (Albert's sister Maja later married Winteler's son Paul.) In January 1896, with his father's approval, Einstein renounced his citizenship in the German Kingdom of Württemberg to avoid military service. In September 1896, he passed the Swiss Matura with mostly good grades, including a top grade of 6 in physics and mathematical subjects, on a scale of 1–6. At 17, he enrolled in the four-year mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Zürich Polytechnic. Marie Winteler, who <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> older, moved to Olsberg, Switzerland, for a teaching post.|$|E
5|$|Mellitus fled {{first to}} Canterbury, but Æthelberht's {{successor}} Eadbald {{was also a}} pagan, so Mellitus, accompanied by Justus, took refuge in Gaul. Mellitus was recalled to Britain by Laurence, the second Archbishop of Canterbury, after his conversion of Eadbald. How long Mellitus' exile lasted is unclear. Bede claims it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> but {{it may have been}} longer. However, Mellitus did not return to London, because the East Saxons remained pagan. Although Mellitus fled, there {{does not seem to have}} been any serious persecution of Christians in the East Saxon kingdom. The East Saxon see was not occupied again until Cedd was consecrated as bishop in about 654.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon {{was born}} on 15 August 1769, to Carlo Maria di Buonaparte and Maria Letizia Ramolino, in his family's ancestral home Casa Buonaparte in Ajaccio, {{the capital of the}} island of Corsica.

He was christened Napoleone di Buonaparte, probably named after an uncle (an older brother who did not survive infancy {{was the first of the}} sons to be called Napoleone). In his 20s, he adopted the more French-sounding Napoléon Bonaparte.|$|E

5|$|Siglinda Scarpa {{says she}} had issues with {{communication}} as a child, stating that “people were not seeing me, that they were talking, but never to me.” It was not until her father brought a stray kitten home and placed it under her sheets that Scarpa felt she could communicate with someone. The kitten <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> old when he became very ill and died. After his death, Scarpa decided to take in as many cats as possible, with the hopes of eventually creating {{a safe haven for}} cats. Scarpa created the Goathouse Refuge in 2007, naming it after an old goat who came with the dilapidated plantation house and the 16 acre property. Originally, the land was just intended for her pottery studio. After the house and studio burned down Scarpa rebuilt it with plans that included a sanctuary for cats, using personal resources and proceeds from her pottery sales to make it possible.|$|E
5|$|Site {{preparation}} for L'Enfant promenade and plaza began in November 1965. Air rights over 9th Street SW were granted for a rent of $500 {{per year for}} 99 years on November 23, 1965. The actual groundbreaking for L'Enfant Plaza occurred on December 9 but the project was still hindered by delays. The federal government was building the James V. Forrestal Building at {{the northern end of}} L'Enfant promenade, and the whole northern end of the promenade and the associated roadway <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> behind its construction schedule by June 1967. Meanwhile, over-optimistic construction schedules and labor shortages meant L'Enfant Plaza Corp's building of the North and South buildings were six months behind projected schedules. The $23 million complex neared completion in January 1968, and the office buildings, plaza, and promenade opened to the public and businesses in June 1968. The plaza was formally dedicated on Saturday, November 16, 1968.|$|E
