5|$|Between September 2008 and December 2010, twenty-two spectra were {{collected}} using the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) instrument at Hawaii's W.M. Keck Observatory. This data {{was used to}} derive HAT-P-33's radial velocity. A far greater number of spectra <b>were</b> <b>gathered</b> for HAT-P-33 than the number usually gathered for planetary candidates {{to compensate for the}} data's jitter effect. It was concluded that the jitter in the data was caused by stellar activity and not the presence of other planets.|$|E
5|$|By {{the sixth}} {{year of the}} revolt (494 BC), the Persian forces had regrouped. The {{available}} land forces <b>were</b> <b>gathered</b> into one army, and were accompanied by a fleet supplied by the re-subjugated Cypriots, along with Egyptians, Cilicians and Phoenicians. The Persians headed directly to Miletus, paying little attention to other strongholds, presumably intending to tackle the revolt at its epicentre. The Median general Datis, an expert on Greek affairs, was certainly dispatched to Ionia by Darius at this time. It is therefore possible {{that he was in}} overall command of this Persian offensive.|$|E

50|$|There {{are four}} types of {{resources}} a player has to gather: food, wood, stone and gold. Food can <b>be</b> <b>gathered</b> by harvesting crops, milking cows or killing them for meat, as well as fishing if the map has lakes or rivers. Wood <b>is</b> <b>gathered</b> by chopping down trees, and gold and silver <b>are</b> <b>gathered</b> by mining. All units have health (hit points) but sorcerers also have mana which gradually regenerates when used to cast spells or summon creatures.|$|R

5|$|Matilda {{returned}} to Normandy in 1125 and spent {{about a year}} at the royal court, where her father Henry was still hoping that his second marriage would generate a male heir. In the event that this might fail to happen, Matilda was now Henry's preferred choice, and he declared that she was to be his rightful successor if he should die without a male heir. The Anglo-Norman barons <b>were</b> <b>gathered</b> together at Westminster on Christmas 1126, where they swore in January to recognise Matilda and any future legitimate heir she might have.|$|E

5|$|The Germans {{had begun}} massing troops near the Soviet border {{even before the}} {{campaign}} in the Balkans had finished. By {{the third week of}} February 1941, 680,000 German soldiers <b>were</b> <b>gathered</b> in assembly areas on the Romanian-Soviet border. In preparation for the attack, Hitler had secretly moved upwards of 3 million German troops and approximately 690,000 Axis soldiers to the Soviet border regions. Additional Luftwaffe operations included numerous aerial surveillance missions over Soviet territory many months before the attack.|$|E
5|$|The first troops reached Madang on 8 February, and {{the whole}} {{movement}} was complete by 23 February. Eighteenth Army anticipated that units reaching Madang, would probably have lost much of their equipment, as was indeed the case, so stores <b>were</b> <b>gathered</b> together from distant Wewak and Hansa, and collected together near Madang. In addition emergency articles such as some food, shoes and clothing were collected {{near the mouth of}} the Minderi River, supplied by the Nakai Detachment.|$|E
5|$|The rivers {{played a}} leading role in the {{lifestyle}} of the Aboriginal people, acting as a source of food and a means of communication and trade. Murray cod and shellfish <b>were</b> <b>gathered</b> for food and bark canoes were used for travel along the rivers. Scars on many trees alongside the rivers are evidence of this extensive use of canoes. In the summer it is likely that the Bangerang and Wiradjuri joined the Monaro groups in the Bogong moth feasts in the alpine country to the east.|$|E

The names of his characters were given {{to a variety of}} products. The popularity of Quo Vadis in France, where it was the best-selling book of 1900, is shown by the fact that horses competing in a Grand Prix de Paris event were named for characters in the book. In the United States, Quo Vadis sold 800,000 copies in eighteen months. To avoid intrusive journalists and fans, Sienkiewicz sometimes traveled incognito.|$|E

5|$|During August and September 1326, Edward mobilised his defences {{along the}} coasts of England {{to protect against the}} {{possibility}} of an invasion either by France or by Roger Mortimer. Fleets <b>were</b> <b>gathered</b> at the ports of Portsmouth in the south and Orwell on the east coast, and a raiding force of 1,600 men was sent across the English Channel into Normandy as a diversionary attack. Edward issued a nationalistic appeal for his subjects to defend the kingdom, but with little impact. The regime's hold on power at the local level was fragile, the Despensers were widely disliked, and many of those Edward entrusted with the defence of the kingdom proved incompetent, or promptly turned against the regime. Some 2,000 men were ordered to gather at Orwell to repel any invasion, but only 55 appear to have actually arrived.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{employed}} trusted {{architects and}} engineers {{to run the}} projects, most prominently the Savoyard Master James of St George, but also Edward's close friend Otto de Grandson, the soldier Sir John de Bonvillars and the master mason John Francis. The English had built castles {{in the wake of}} the 1272 conflict, usually larger and more expensive than those of the local Welsh rulers, but the new fortifications were on a still grander scale. Carpenters, ditch diggers and stonemasons <b>were</b> <b>gathered</b> by local sheriffs from across England and mustered at Chester and Bristol, before being sent on to North Wales in the spring, returning home each winter. The number of workers involved was so great that it placed a significant strain on England's national labour force. The costs were huge: Caernarfon's castle and walls cost £15,500, Conwy's castle and walls came to around £15,000 and Harlech Castle cost £8,190 to construct.|$|E
