5|$|Ricardo Carvalho, Frank Lampard and Avram Grant all {{refused to}} point the finger of blame at John Terry, but {{assistant}} manager Henk ten Cate admitted that Terry was not originally due {{to take one of}} the first five penalties (if Drogba had not been sent off, he would have taken the fifth penalty). Chelsea offered Terry counselling {{as a result of his}} devastation following the miss of his penalty, and subsequently, the loss of the final. Terry was later accused of spitting at Manchester United striker Carlos Tevez, but a UEFA report into the video evidence cleared him of any wrongdoing. Terry also wrote an open letter, published on Chelsea's official website, apologising for missing the penalty and costing Chelsea the trophy. Nicolas Anelka, who took the decisive kick, revealed he did not actually want to take a penalty, citing lack of <b>warm-up</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
25|$|Following World War II, tubes {{intended}} {{to be used in}} series heater strings were redesigned to all have the same ("controlled") <b>warm-up</b> <b>time.</b> Earlier designs had quite-different thermal time constants. The audio output stage, for instance, had a larger cathode, and warmed up more slowly than lower-powered tubes. The result was that heaters that warmed up faster also temporarily had higher resistance, because of their positive temperature coefficient. This disproportionate resistance caused them to temporarily operate with heater voltages well above their ratings, and shortened their life.|$|E
25|$|The Prius is a {{power-split}} or series-parallel (full) hybrid, {{sometimes referred}} to as a combined hybrid, a vehicle that can be propelled by gasoline or electric power or both. Wind resistance is reduced by a drag coefficient of 0.25 (0.29 for 2000 model) with a Kammback design to reduce air resistance. Lower rolling-resistance tires are used to reduce road friction. An electric water pump eliminates serpentine belts. In the US and Canada, a vacuum flask is used to store hot coolant when the vehicle is powered off for reuse so as to reduce <b>warm-up</b> <b>time.</b> The Prius engine makes use of the Atkinson cycle.|$|E

25|$|As a cost {{reduction}} measure, especially in high-volume consumer receivers, all the tube heaters could be connected in series across the AC supply using heaters requiring the same current {{and with a}} similar <b>warm-up</b> <b>time.</b> In one such design, a tap on the tube heater string supplied the 6 volts needed for the dial light. By deriving the high voltage from a half-wave rectifier directly connected to the AC mains, the heavy and costly power transformer was eliminated. This also allowed such receivers to operate on direct current, a so-called AC/DC receiver design. Many different US consumer AM radio manufacturers of the era used a virtually identical circuit, given the nickname All American Five.|$|E
25|$|Tube heaters {{may also}} fail without warning, {{especially}} if exposed to over voltage or {{as a result}} of manufacturing defects. Tube heaters do not normally fail by evaporation like lamp filaments, since they operate at much lower temperature. The surge of inrush current when the heater is first energized causes stress in the heater, and can be avoided by slowly warming the heaters, gradually increasing current with a NTC thermistor included in the circuit. Tubes intended for series-string operation of the heaters across the supply have a specified controlled <b>warm-up</b> <b>time</b> to avoid excess voltage on some heaters as others warm up. Directly heated filament-type cathodes as used in battery-operated tubes or some rectifiers may fail if the filament sags, causing internal arcing. Excess heater-to-cathode voltage in indirectly heated cathodes can break down the insulation between elements and destroy the heater.|$|E
500|$|On September 29, 2006 (sol [...] ), MRO {{took its}} first high {{resolution}} image from its science orbit. This image {{is said to}} resolve items as small as 90cm (3feet) in diameter. On October 6, NASA released detailed pictures from the MRO of Victoria crater along with the Opportunity rover on the rim above it. In November, problems began to surface {{in the operation of}} two MRO spacecraft instruments. A stepping mechanism in the Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) skipped on multiple occasions resulting in a field of view that is slightly out of position. By December normal operations of the instrument was suspended, although a mitigation strategy allows the instrument to continue making most of its intended observations. Also, an increase in noise and resulting bad pixels has been observed in several CCDs of the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE). Operation of this camera with a longer <b>warm-up</b> <b>time</b> has alleviated the issue. However, the cause is still unknown and may return.|$|E

2500|$|All Mazda-made Wankel rotaries, {{including}} the Renesis {{found in the}} RX-8, burn a small quantity of oil by design, metered into the combustion chamber to preserve the apex seals. Owners must periodically add small amounts of oil, thereby increasing running costs. Some sources, such as rotaryeng.net, claim that better results come {{with the use of}} an oil-in-fuel mixture rather than an oil metering pump. Liquid-cooled engines require a mineral multigrade oil for cold starts, and Wankel engines need a <b>warm-up</b> <b>time</b> before full load operation as reciprocating engines do. All engines exhibit oil loss, but the rotary engine is engineered with a sealed motor, unlike a piston engine that has a film of oil that splashes {{on the walls of the}} cylinder to lubricate them, hence an oil [...] "control" [...] ring. No-oil-loss engines have been developed, eliminating much of the oil lubrication problem.|$|E

40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis concerns the continued development and application of a computational model to simulate the thermal behaviour of internal combustion engines. The model provides information on temperature and heat flow distributions within the engine structure, and on temperatures of oil, coolant and engine-out exhaust gas. Sub-models calculate friction levels, fuel flow rates and gas-side heat transfer, including the effects of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), spark advance and turbocharging. The effects of auxiliary components such as a cabin heater, oil cooler, intercooler, supplementary heater and EGR cooler can also be simulated. Model developments are aligned towards improving the accessibility of the model and the scope of engine systems that can be simulated. Early versions of the model have been converted from 'C' into the current MATLAB/Simulink versions. The model structure and conversion process are described. New developments undertaken {{have focused on the}} external coolant circuit and include the modelling of the thermostat and radiator. A semi-empirical thermostat model is presented. A radiator model based on the effectiveness-NTU method is described. Simulations using the developed model, including the thermostat and radiator sub-models, investigate the effect of thermostat position on engine thermal behaviour. Positioning the thermostat on the inlet to the engine reduces thermal shock. Applications of the model to investigations of sensitivity and performance illustrate the accuracy of and confidence in model predictions. Assessments demonstrate that the model is relatively insensitive to variations of 100 / 0 in user inputs and is very sensitive to model assumptions if simulation conditions, implied in the model assumptions, are not matched to test conditions. A process for evaluating model performance is described. Evaluation exercises applied to three different engines demonstrate that values predicted by the model are to within 5 to 10 % of experimental values. Investigations using the model of methods to improve <b>warm-up</b> <b>times</b> and fuel consumption prior to fully warm conditions show the benefits or otherwise of reduced thermal capacity, an oil cooler, a sump oil heater and an oil-exhaust gas heat exchanger. Each method is assessed over the New European Drive Cycle (NEDC) from a - 10 °C start. Of these methods, a combined reduction in coolant volume and engine structural mass is most beneficial for reducing coolant <b>warm-up</b> <b>times.</b> An oil-exhaust gas heat exchanger produces the greatest reduction in fuel consumption.

50|$|An {{altitude}} encoder {{takes the form}} of a small metal box containing a pressure sensor and signal conditioning electronics. The pressure sensor is often heated, which requires a <b>warm-up</b> <b>time</b> during which height information is either unavailable or inaccurate.

This is not normally a problem as the power would typically be applied before the aircraft enters the runway and so it would be transmitting correct height information soon after take-off.|$|E

50|$|Solid ink printers, {{also known}} as phase-change printers, are a type of thermal {{transfer}} printer. They use solid sticks of CMYK-coloured ink, similar in consistency to candle wax, which are melted and fed into a piezo crystal operated print-head. The printhead sprays the ink on a rotating, oil coated drum. The paper then passes over the print drum, at which time the image is immediately transferred, or transfixed, to the page. Solid ink printers are most commonly used as colour office printers, and are excellent at printing on transparencies and other non-porous media. Solid ink printers can produce excellent results. Acquisition and operating costs are similar to laser printers. Drawbacks of the technology include high energy consumption and long <b>warm-up</b> <b>times</b> from a cold state. Also, some users complain that the resulting prints are difficult to write on, as the wax tends to repel inks from pens, and are difficult to feed through automatic document feeders, but these traits have been significantly reduced in later models. In addition, this type of printer is only available from one manufacturer, Xerox, manufactured {{as part of their}} Xerox Phaser office printer line. Previously, solid ink printers were manufactured by Tektronix, but Tek sold the printing business to Xerox in 2001.|$|R
