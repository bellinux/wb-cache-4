25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous version of the cricket cap in the modern setting is the baggy green cricket cap of the Australian cricket team, for which the players and fans of Australia hold a degree of reverence. The cap is treated {{with a degree of}} mysticism, and players <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>long</b> careers often refuse to replace the {{original}} one they receive as they often feel the cap is a lucky talisman. This sometimes results in players <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>long</b> careers wearing their cricket caps in quite a tattered state. The Australian side has long worn their baggy cricket cap, rather than alternatives such as a sun hat, for the first session of each match as a symbol of team solidarity.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to these contemporary great powers mentioned above, Zbigniew Brzezinski and Mohan Malik consider India {{to be a great}} power too. Although unlike the contemporary great powers <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>long</b> been considered so, India's recognition among authorities as a great power is comparatively recent. However there is no collective agreement among observers as to the status of India, for example, a number of academics believe that India is emerging as a great power, while some believe that India remains a middle power.|$|E
25|$|Local Bedouins <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>long</b> {{inhabited}} the area have identified Jebel Musa as Mount Sinai. In {{the fourth century}} CE small settlements of monks set up places of worship around Jebel Musa. An Egyptian pilgrim named Ammonius, who had in past times made various visits to the area, identified Jebel Musa as the Holy Mount in the 4th century. Empress Helena, ca. 330 CE, built a church to protect monks against raids from nomads. She chose {{the site for the}} church from the identification which had been handed down through generations through the Bedouins. She also reported the site was confirmed to her in a dream.|$|E
25|$|Methamphetamine induces a {{psychosis}} in 26–46 {{percent of}} heavy users. Some {{of these people}} develop a long-lasting psychosis that can persist for longer than six months. Those {{who have had a}} short-lived psychosis from methamphetamine can have a relapse of the methamphetamine psychosis years later after a stress event such as severe insomnia or a period of heavy alcohol abuse despite not relapsing back to methamphetamine. Individuals <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>long</b> history of methamphetamine abuse and who have experienced psychosis in the past from methamphetamine abuse are highly likely to rapidly relapse back into a methamphetamine psychosis within a week or so of going back onto methamphetamine.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, on the {{industrial}} world of Giedi Prime, the sadistic Baron Vladimir Harkonnen tells his nephews Glossu Rabban and Feyd-Rautha about his plan to eliminate the Atreides by manipulating someone in House Atreides into betraying the Duke. The Atreides leave their homeworld Caladan for Arrakis, a barren desert planet populated by gigantic sandworms. The native people of Arrakis are called the Fremen, a mysterious people <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>long</b> held a prophecy that a messiah would come to lead them to freedom. Upon arrival on Arrakis, Leto is informed {{by one of his}} right-hand men, Duncan Idaho, that the Fremen have been underestimated, as they exist in vast numbers and could prove to be powerful allies. Leto begins to gain the trust of the Fremen, but before the Duke can establish an alliance, the Harkonnens launch their attack.|$|E
500|$|First, the Lutheran calendar, while commemorating many of {{the same}} events or persons, often does so on {{different}} days from either calendar (St. Cyprian of Carthage on September 16 for Lutherans, but September 13 in the Episcopal Church). In other cases (such as St. Valentine on February 14), individuals <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>long</b> standing within Western Christianity are not mentioned in the Lutheran calendar, or are only mentioned in the calendars of some Lutheran churches. Furthermore, some Lutheran calendars (such as that of the LCMS) still venerate individuals whose commemorations have been suppressed in other Western Churches. Finally, the Lutheran calendar commemorates persons or events (such as the presentation of the Augsburg Confession on June 25) which are not commemorated in any other Christian calendar because of their specific importance to the Lutheran Church. [...] In general, like the Anglican counterpart, the Lutheran calendar has taken on {{many of the}} precedents established by the post-Vatican II reforms of the liturgy in the Roman Catholic Church.|$|E

500|$|Their plane crashes on {{an island}} in the South Pacific; Michael, Walt and Walt's labrador Vincent are among the survivors. After Vincent runs into the jungle, Michael {{searches}} for him, but to no avail; it is later that Locke (Terry O'Quinn) returns Vincent to Michael. Despite this gesture, Michael is skeptical about Locke, and does not want Walt spending time with him. After Michael is attacked by a Korean survivor, Jin, over a gold watch Michael has started wearing, Jin's wife Sun approaches him to explain that it is her father's watch, and in doing so reveals that she speaks English. Michael begins constructing a raft, in hope that he and Walt can escape the Island. After witnessing his completed raft burned down, Michael blames Jin, but later Walt confesses that it was him. Although Walt did not want to leave the Island, he has now changed his mind. Michael and Jin bond after Sun reveals her ability to speak English, and the two men begin work on a second raft. They offer the final space on board to Sawyer (Josh Holloway). In the season finale [...] "Exodus", Michael sets sail with Jin, Sawyer and Walt, and not far from the Island, they encounter a small fishing boat. The occupants of the fishing boat are the Others, <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>long</b> inhabited the Island. They kidnap Walt and destroy the raft.|$|E

Those who can't make the journey become lost and wandering souls, but they do not burn in [...] "hell fire".|$|E

The book of Ainu Life and Legends by author Kyōsuke Kindaichi (published by the Japanese Tourist Board in 1942) contains the physical description of Ainu: [...] "Many have wavy hair, but some straight black hair. Very {{few of them}} have wavy brownish hair. Their skins are generally reported to be light brown. But {{this is due to}} the fact that they labor on the sea and in briny winds all day. Old people <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>long</b> desisted from their outdoor work are often found to be as white as western men.

It became a bicultural alternative to Spanish-language networks such as Univision and Telemundo. According to Sean O'Neal of The A.V.

2500|$|Muslims {{have been}} living in Tibet since as early as the 8th or 9th century. In Tibetan cities, there are small {{communities}} of Muslims, known as Kachee (Kache), who trace their origin to immigrants from three main regions: Kashmir (Kachee Yul in ancient Tibetan), Ladakh and the Central Asian Turkic countries. Islamic influence in Tibet also came from Persia. A Muslim Sufi Syed Ali Hamdani [...] preached the people of Baltistan then known as little Tibet [...] Which became main cause of the cultural separation of the people of Baltistan from the mainstream Tibet [...] After 1959 a group of Tibetan Muslims made a case for Indian nationality based on their historic roots to Kashmir and the Indian government declared all Tibetan Muslims Indian citizens later on that year. Other Muslim ethnic groups <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>long</b> inhabited Tibet include Hui, Salar, Dongxiang and Bonan. There is also a well established Chinese Muslim community (gya kachee), which traces its ancestry back to the Hui ethnic group of China.|$|E
2500|$|The final part of Isac's {{career was}} marked by the {{politicization}} of his writing, in line with Socialist Realism and its Romanian literary avatar. His poetry pieces for Veac Nou are seen by academic Letiţia Constantin as evidence that Isac had a satisfactory political background from the communist point of view. Constantin describes them as agitprop pieces, stylistically [...] "pastiches" [...] of Soviet poetry. The importance Isac had for the new literary mainstream, shaped in the 1950s by censorship and waves of political repression, was underlined by communist poet Dan Deşliu in a 1956 report for the Writers' Union of Romania: [...] "after World War I {{and especially in the}} period of our country's fascization, [...] the flame of poetry continued to burn, lighting the way of tomorrow. With different intensities, its rays are the creation of poets <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>long</b> since entered Romanian literary history, such as: G. Topîrceanu, A. Toma, Emil Isac, G. Bacovia or maestro Tudor Arghezi, whom we presently take joy in counting among the active members in our ranks".|$|E
