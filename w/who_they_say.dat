5|$|The Wiz is a 1978 American musical {{adventure}} film {{produced by}} Universal Pictures and Motown Productions, and released by Universal Pictures on October 24, 1978. An urban reimagining of L. Frank Baum's classic 1900 children's novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz featuring an entirely African-American cast, The Wiz was loosely {{adapted from the}} 1974 Broadway musical of the same name. The film follows the adventures of Dorothy, a shy twenty-four-year-old Harlem, New York City, schoolteacher who finds herself magically transported to the urban fantasy Land of Oz, which resembles an alternative fantasy version of New York City. Befriended by a Scarecrow, a Tin Man, and a Cowardly Lion, she travels through the city to seek an audience with the mysterious Wiz, <b>who</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> {{is the only one}} powerful enough to send her home.|$|E

500|$|According to {{contemporary}} newspaper columns, {{at the time}} of his appointment as commissioner, Landis was considered a liberal on race questions; two Chicago African-American newspapers defended him against the 1921 efforts to impeach him from his judgeship. [...] A number of baseball authors have ascribed racism to Landis, <b>who</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> actively perpetuated baseball's color line. [...] James Bankes, in The Pittsburgh Crawfords, tracing the history of that Negro League team, states that Landis, whom the author suggests was a Southerner, made [...] "little effort to disguise his racial prejudice during 25years in office" [...] and [...] "remained a steadfast foe of integration". [...] Negro League historian John Holway termed Landis [...] "the hard-bitten Carolinian [...] Kennesaw [...] Mountain Landis". [...] In a 2000 article in Smithsonian magazine, writer Bruce Watson states that Landis [...] "upheld baseball's unwritten ban on black players and did nothing to push owners toward integration". [...] A number of authors say that Landis banned major league play against black teams for fear the white teams would lose, though they ascribe various dates for this action, and the Dodgers are known to have played black teams in and around their Havana spring training base as late as 1942.|$|E
500|$|Several James Turner Street {{residents}} have claimed they were tricked into {{appearing in the}} series by Love Productions, <b>who</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> told them it would be about community spirit. One resident told the Birmingham Mail, [...] "They {{told me it was}} about living as a community and how we all got along. But the actual programme doesn't show any of that. If they had said it was about benefits and making the street look bad I would not have taken part. They tricked us." [...] Responding to allegations the residents were duped, Nick Mirsky said that Love Productions had spent much time consulting the residents before filming began, and that process continued afterwards: [...] "Key contributors have been offered viewings of the programmes during the editing period and were given the opportunity to comment on them. Both Love and Channel 4 listened to any concerns raised, and in some cases made changes to the programme to accommodate them." [...] Dierdre Kelly, however, subsequently told ITV's This Morning that she believed the programme had provided a one-sided view of her community, and that the residents [...] "went into the show naively". Gareth Price of The Guardian suggested the show's producers [...] "adeptly edited their film in order to provoke a response from its intended audience".|$|E

2500|$|On 6 December, Occupy Homes, an {{offshoot}} of Occupy Wall Street, embarked on a [...] "national day of action" [...] to protest the mistreatment of homeowners by big banks, <b>who</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> made billions of dollars off the housing bubble by offering predatory loans and indulging in practices that allegedly took advantage of consumers. In {{more than two dozen}} cities across the nation the movement took on the housing crisis by re-occupying foreclosed homes, disrupting bank auctions and blocking evictions. On 17 September 2012, protesters returned to Zuccotti Park to mark the one-year anniversary of the beginning of the occupation.|$|E

Despite Bachmann's leading all other Representatives in fund raising, a Republican aide stated some [...] "members are getting resentful of Bachmann, <b>who</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> is making the argument that you're not really a Tea Party supporter unless you support her. That's gone through {{the formation of the}} Tea Party Caucus and the formation of this candidacy of hers. It's just not so." [...] Sarah Palin, with whom Bachmann had campaigned earlier in the year, declined to endorse her leadership bid, while other Tea Party favorites Reps Adam Kinzinger and Tim Scott were placed on the transition team. [...] According to some senior House staff members, the party leadership was concerned about some of Bachmann's high profile faux pas, the high rate of turnover among her staff, and how willing she would be to advance the party's messaging rather than her own.|$|E
2500|$|Various organizations, such as Human Rights Watch, {{have called}} for {{investigations}} of Rumsfeld regarding his involvement in managing the Iraq War and his support of the Bush administration's policies of [...] "enhanced interrogation techniques", which are widely regarded as torture. Scholars have argued that Rumsfeld could [...] "probably {{be held responsible for}} ordering, sollicitating (sic) or inducing war crimes". In 2005 the ACLU and Human Rights First filed a lawsuit against Rumsfeld and other top government officials, [...] "on behalf of eight men <b>who</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> were subjected to torture and abuse by U.S. forces under the command of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld". In 2005, a suit was filed against Rumsfeld by several human rights organizations for allegedly violating U.S. and international law that prohibits [...] "torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading punishment". Donald Vance and Nathan Ertel filed suit against the U.S. government and Rumsfeld on similar grounds, alleging that they were tortured and their rights of habeas corpus were violated. In 2007, U.S. District Judge Thomas F. Hogan ruled that Rumsfeld could not [...] "be held personally responsible for actions taken in connection with his government job". The ACLU tried to revive the case in 2011 with no success.|$|E
2500|$|... "In {{the days}} when the judges ruled": or, more literally, [...] "when the judges judged". The {{beautiful}} and interesting story which this book relates belongs to the early times of the judges. The precise date cannot be ascertained. This note of time, like that in , indicates that this Book was written after the rule of the judges had ceased. The genealogy [...] points to the time of David as the earliest when the Book of Ruth could have been written. Josephus places it in the government of Eli, but that is too late for Boaz, the grandfather of Jesse, the father of David, to live. Some Jewish writers, as Jarchi, say it was in the times of Ibzan, <b>who</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> is the same with Boaz, but without proof, and which times are too late also for this history. The Jewish chronology comes nearer the truth, which carries it up as high as the times of Eglon, king of Moab, when Ehud was judge; and with which Dr. Lightfoot pretty much agrees, who puts this history between the third and fourth chapters of Judges, and so must belong to the times of Ehud or Shamgar. Junius refers it to the times of Deborah and Barak; and others, on account of the famine, think it began in the times the Midianites oppressed Israel, and carried off the fruits of the earth, which caused it, when Gideon was raised up to be their judge.|$|E
