5|$|One {{early and}} {{influential}} theory of scientific explanation is the deductive-nomological model. It {{says that a}} successful scientific explanation must deduce the occurrence of the phenomena in question from a scientific law. This view {{has been subjected to}} substantial criticism, resulting in several widely acknowledged counterexamples to the theory. It is especially challenging to characterize <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> by an explanation when the thing to be explained cannot be deduced from any law because {{it is a matter of}} chance, or otherwise cannot be perfectly predicted from what is known. Wesley Salmon developed a model in which a good scientific explanation must be statistically relevant to the outcome to be explained. Others have argued that the key to a good explanation is unifying disparate phenomena or providing a causal mechanism.|$|E

25|$|Nothing {{is easier}} than to realize the {{inconsistencies}} of demand and supply, and the resulting deviation of market-prices from market-values. The real difficulty consists in determining <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> by the equation of supply and demand.|$|E
25|$|A small centrepiece {{of flowers}} or other objects is often {{placed at the}} centre of the circle to help focus the dancers and {{maintain}} the circular shape. Much debate goes on within the sacred circle dance network about <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> by 'sacred' in the dance.|$|E
25|$|The demonstrative hé is {{the most}} neutral. Once a noun has been located, either by {{pointing}} or by description, in space or in the listener’s mind, hé can then be used. Before that, lé or ká is usually used to demonstrate exactly <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>meant,</b> although hé may also be used while pointing.|$|E

25|$|Constructive trusts {{pop up in}} {{many aspects}} of equity, not just in a {{remedial}} sense, but, in this sense, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> by a constructive trust is that the court has created and imposed a duty on the fiduciary to hold the money in safekeeping until it can be rightfully transferred to the principal.|$|E
25|$|Neoclassical {{economics}} {{is characterized by}} several assumptions common to many schools of economic thought. There is not a complete agreement on <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> by neoclassical economics, {{and the result is}} a wide range of neoclassical approaches to various problem areas and domains—ranging from neoclassical theories of labor to neoclassical theories of demographic changes.|$|E
25|$|The isometries of {{the plane}} act {{on the set of}} 2D images and patterns, such as {{wallpaper}} patterns. The definition can be made more precise by specifying <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> by image or pattern; e.g., a function of position with values in a set of colors. Isometries are in fact one example of affine group (action).|$|E

25|$|The {{attribute}} of extension is how substance {{can be understood}} to be physically extended in space. Particular things which have breadth and depth (that is, occupy space) are <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> by extended. It follows from this that if substance and God are identical, in Spinoza's view, and contrary to the traditional conception, God has extension {{as one of his}} attributes.|$|E
25|$|Physicians {{sometimes}} use {{the term}} palliative care in a sense meaning palliative therapies without curative intent, when no cure can be expected (as often happens in late-stage cancers). For example, tumor debulking can continue to reduce pain from mass effect {{even when it is}} no longer curative. A clearer usage is palliative, noncurative therapy when that is <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>meant,</b> because palliative care can be used along with curative or aggressive therapies.|$|E
25|$|In the German literature, an {{alternate}} term for vacant niches has found some acceptance. It {{is that of}} “freie ökologische Lizens” (free ecological license) (Sudhaus und Rehfeld 1992). It {{has been argued that}} this conceptualization has a disadvantage in that it does not convey immediately and easily <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>meant,</b> furthermore the concept does not correspond exactly to the term vacant niche. The usefulness of a term should be assessed {{on the basis of its}} understandability and on its capacity to promote future research. The term vacant niche appears to fulfill these requirements.|$|E

25|$|The term Wallonia {{can mean}} {{slightly}} different things in different contexts. One {{of the three}} federal regions of Belgium is still constitutionally defined as the Walloon Region, but the region's government has renamed it Wallonia, and it is commonly called Wallonia. Preceding 1 April 2010, when the renaming came into effect, Wallonia would sometimes refer to the territory governed by the Walloon Region, whereas Walloon Region referred specifically to the government. In practice, {{the difference between the}} two terms is small and <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> is usually clear, based on context.|$|E
25|$|The {{meaning of}} the term {{geometry}} in the context of Minkowski space depends heavily on <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> by the term. Minkowski space is not endowed with a Euclidean geometry, and not with any of the generalized Riemannian geometries with intrinsic curvature, those exposed by the model spaces in hyperbolic geometry (negative curvature) and the geometry modeled by the sphere (positive curvature). The reason is the indefiniteness of the Minkowski metric. Minkowski space is, in particular, not a metric space and not a Riemannian manifold with a Riemannian metric. However, Minkowski space contains submanifolds endowed with a Riemannian metric yielding hyperbolic geometry.|$|E
25|$|Later the {{equations}} of motion also appeared in electrodynamics, when describing the motion of charged particles in electric and magnetic fields, the Lorentz force is the general equation which serves as the definition of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> by an electric field and magnetic field. With the advent of special relativity and general relativity, the theoretical modifications to spacetime meant the classical {{equations of motion}} were also modified {{to account for the}} finite speed of light, and curvature of spacetime. In all these cases the differential equations were in terms of a function describing the particle's trajectory in terms of space and time coordinates, as influenced by forces or energy transformations.|$|E

25|$|Subtitle {{translation}} can {{be different}} from the translation of written text. Usually, during the process of creating subtitles for a film or television program, the picture and each sentence of the audio are analyzed by the subtitle translator; also, the subtitle translator {{may or may not have}} access to a written transcript of the dialog. Especially in the field of commercial subtitles, the subtitle translator often interprets <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>meant,</b> rather than translating the manner in which the dialog is stated; that is, the meaning is more important than the form—the audience does not always appreciate this, as it can be frustrating for people who are familiar with some of the spoken language; spoken language may contain verbal padding or culturally implied meanings that cannot be conveyed in the written subtitles. Also, the subtitle translator may also condense the dialog to achieve an acceptable reading speed, whereby purpose is more important than form.|$|E
25|$|There is {{disagreement}} in surgical textbooks regarding {{which side}} of the recipient’s pelvis to use in receiving the transplant. Campbell's Urology (2002) recommends placing the donor kidney in the recipient’s contralateral side (i.e. a left sided kidney would be transplanted in the recipient's right side) to ensure the renal pelvis and ureter are anterior in the event that future surgeries are required. In an instance where there is doubt over whether there is enough space in the recipient’s pelvis for the donor's kidney, the textbook recommends using the right side because the right side has a wider choice of arteries and veins for reconstruction. Smith's Urology (2004) states that either side of the recipient's pelvis is acceptable; however the right vessels are 'more horizontal' with respect to each other and therefore easier to use in the anastomoses. It is unclear <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> by the words 'more horizontal'. Glen's Urological Surgery (2004) recommends putting the kidney in the contralateral side in all circumstances. No reason is explicitly put forth; however, one can assume the rationale {{is similar to that of}} Campbell, i.e. to ensure that the renal pelvis and ureter are most anterior in the event that future surgical correction becomes necessary.|$|E
25|$|Before the 19th century, {{divergent}} series were widely used by Leonhard Euler and others, but often led to confusing and contradictory results. A major problem was Euler's idea that any {{divergent series}} {{should have a}} natural sum, without first defining <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> by the sum of a divergent series. Augustin-Louis Cauchy eventually gave a rigorous definition of the sum of a (convergent) series, and for some time after this, divergent series were mostly excluded from mathematics. They reappeared in 1886 with Henri Poincaré's work on asymptotic series. In 1890, Ernesto Cesàro realized that one could give a rigorous definition of the sum of some divergent series, and defined Cesàro summation. (This {{was not the first}} use of Cesàro summation, which was used implicitly by Ferdinand Georg Frobenius in 1880; Cesàro's key contribution was not the discovery of this method, but his idea that one should give an explicit definition of the sum of a divergent series.) In the years after Cesàro's paper, several other mathematicians gave other definitions of the sum of a divergent series, although these are not always compatible: different definitions can give different answers for the sum of the same divergent series; so, when talking about the sum of a divergent series, it is necessary to specify which summation method one is using.|$|E
