5|$|The delegates couldn't {{agree on}} whether the {{executive}} should be a single person, or a board of three. Many wished to limit {{the power of the}} executive and thus supported the proposal to divide the executive power between three persons. The possible problems of this system, in addition to the knowledge that George Washington <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> first president, calmed the fears enough so that the proponents of a singular executive could accumulate a large coalition. This issue came up occasionally after the matter was settled, but was never again seriously doubted.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{cross-sections}} {{of these}} fusion-evaporation reactions increase with the asymmetry of the reaction, titanium {{would be a}} better projectile than chromium for the synthesis of element 121. This necessitates an einsteinium target, since titanium has 22 protons and the remaining 99 must be supplied by the target, and einsteinium is element 99. This poses severe challenges due to the significant heating and damage of the target due to the high radioactivity of einsteinium-254, but it <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> most promising approach to element 119 with 48Ca beams and possibly element 121 with 50Ti beams. It would also require working on a smaller scale due to the lower amount of 254Es that can be produced. This small-scale work could in the near future only be carried out in Dubna's SHE-factory.|$|E
25|$|Lloyd George {{had a long}} {{conversation}} (15 February) with Major Berthier de Sauvigny, a French {{liaison officer}} in London, telling him that Haig needed to be subordinated to Nivelle for the offensive, as George Milne had been subordinated to Sarrail at Salonika, and if necessary he would be replaced. The British War Cabinet felt that the French generals and staff had shown themselves more skilled than the British in 1916, whilst politically Britain had to give wholehearted support to what <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> last major French effort of the war.|$|E

25|$|Tyne Dock to East Boldon along a {{dismantled}} railway alignment through Whiteleas {{could easily}} be added, because two Metro lines are separated by only a short distance (1.61 miles). This would provide a service from South Shields to Sunderland via the Whiteleas area of South Shields. It was originally suggested by the South Tyneside Local Development Framework and reported by a local newspaper, the Shields Gazette, in January 2008. This <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> most likely of extensions, because Nexus is also interested in building stabling facilities for Metro trains at South Shields station {{as part of the}} reinvigoration programme.|$|E
25|$|Neither Robertson nor Derby {{were invited}} to the War Cabinet on 24 February (no minutes were circulated, but on the train to Calais Hankey was {{instructed}} {{to draw up a}} summary to be circulated after the conference), at which ministers felt that the French generals and staff had shown themselves to be more skilful than the British, whilst politically Britain had to give wholehearted support to what <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> last major French effort of the war. Hankey also told Stamfordham that on the train to Calais Lloyd George had informed Robertson and Maurice that he had the authority of the War Cabinet “to decide specifically between Generals Haig & Nivelle”, although the subordination of Haig to Nivelle had not been specifically discussed.|$|E
25|$|Now, in {{the chapter}} on Pangenesis in my Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication I have not said one word about the blood, or about any fluid proper to any {{circulating}} system. It is, indeed, obvious {{that the presence of}} gemmules in the blood can form no necessary part of my hypothesis; for I refer in illustration of it to the lowest animals, such as the Protozoa, which do not possess blood or any vessels; and I refer to plants in which the fluid, when present in the vessels, cannot be considered as true blood. The fundamental laws of growth, reproduction, inheritance, , are so closely similar throughout the whole organic kingdom, that the means by which the gemmules (assuming for the moment their existence) are diffused through the body, <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> same in all beings; therefore the means can hardly be diffusion through the blood. Nevertheless, when I first heard of Mr. Galton's experiments, I did not sufficiently reflect on the subject, and saw not the difficulty of believing in the presence of gemmules in the blood.|$|E

500|$|Scrubs had {{previously}} dabbled {{in the musical}} genre, including a West Side Story parody in the episode [...] "My Way or the Highway," [...] and a Broadway-style finale in [...] "My Philosophy." [...] However, Lawrence had long been unwilling to do full musical episode, because of difficulties making it [...] "organic to the show," [...] {{and because of the}} amount of work that would inevitably be involved. Finally, at the end of Season 5, with Season 6 looking like it <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> last season; Lawrence told the writers that if they were ever going to do a musical episode, it should be in Season 6.|$|E
500|$|In October 2007, MTV {{reported}} that Hot Chip {{was planning to}} give [...] "Ready for the Floor" [...] to Kylie Minogue. Other reports incorrectly suggested that Hot Chip had written Made in the Darks second single, [...] "Ready for the Floor" [...] specifically for Minogue. Taylor explained {{that it was a}} misunderstanding; [...] "It started because someone asked me if we would ever write for Kylie. I said that we'd been asked to write for her but we'd never got round to it. And I said if we had to give her one of our songs, [...] "Ready for the Floor" [...] <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> most suitable. From that, I got misquoted. We didn't write [...] "Ready for the Floor" [...] for Kylie, didn't send it to her and she never heard it." ...|$|E
500|$|By 2010, Hall was {{the captain}} of North Hobart, {{and was one of}} only four players in the TFL to have senior AFL experience. Hall had another good season in 2010; he won his second George Miller Medal, and was {{described}} by his coach as one of the league's five best players and the [...] "best tackler in the competition". Despite carrying a nagging ankle injury, Hall started the 2011 season well, with The Mercurys Brett Stubbs writing that he was arguably the second best player in the league. He missed five weeks {{during the middle of the}} season and, although he was named best on ground in his comeback match, Hall said that another injury <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> end of his career. He played out the rest of the season and finished in ninth place in the State League Player of the Year award, was named on the half-back flank in the TFL Team of the Year, and finished in the top 20 in the Tassie Medal count.|$|E

500|$|During {{his journey}} to Ireland, Lody met a Minneapolis doctor, John William Lee, {{who had been}} {{studying}} eye, ear, nose and throat diseases in Vienna before the outbreak of war had compelled him to leave. Lee was planning to travel back to New York aboard the RMS Baltic, leaving Queenstown (now Cobh) on 7 October, and intended {{to spend a few}} days exploring Ireland before his departure. Lody asked where Lee was planning to stay in Dublin; Lee told him that it <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> Gresham Hotel on Sackville Street, to which Lody replied, [...] "All right, let's go there." [...] They travelled together to the hotel, booked into separate rooms, had dinner together and went to the Empire Theatre. Lody told Lee that he had been based in Germany working for an American adding-machine company. When the conversation turned to the war, Lody opined that the German army was a very well-trained body of strong-bodied and enduring men, {{and that it would be}} hard to beat them. The following day they had breakfast together and went for a walk in Phoenix Park.|$|E
500|$|The game {{is noted}} for its simple combat system that would [...] "disappoint those craving sheer {{mechanical}} depth", as stated by GameSpots Miguel Lopez. [...] The game's puzzle design has been praised for creating a rewarding experience for players who work through challenges on their own; Kristen Reed of Eurogamer, for example, said that [...] "you quietly, logically, willingly proceed, and the illusion is perfect: the game never tells you what to do, even though the game is always telling you what to do". [...] Ico is also considered a short game, taking between seven and ten hours for a single play through, which Game Revolution calls [...] "painfully short" [...] with [...] "no replay outside of self-imposed challenges". G4TV's Matthew Keil, however, felt that [...] "the game is so strong, many will finish 'Ico' {{in one or two}} sittings". [...] The lack of features in the North American release, which would become unlocked on subsequent playthroughs after completing the game, was said to reduce the replay value of the title. Electronic Gaming Monthly notes that [...] "Yorda <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> worst companion -she's scatterbrained and helpless; if not {{for the fact that the}} player develops a bond with her, making the game's ending all the more heartrending." ...|$|E
500|$|Hock Guan Teh of DVD Town said {{he enjoyed}} the episode, and {{although}} it does not contain the [...] "usual amount" [...] of The Simpsons humor, the [...] "rich character development itself makes this episode worth multiple viewings. However, anyone allergic to country music should give this one a pass!" [...] Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict thought the episode featured [...] "one of the best" [...] parodies the Simpsons writers have ever conceived, the parody of the country television series Hee-Haw called Ya-Hoo!: [...] "While one must give multiple kudos to Beverly D'Angelo for writing and performing her own witty hillbilly ditties, it's the twisted cornpone , with such stars as Big Shirtless Ron and Cappy Mae, that really propels this installment into comic heaven. Homer's sheepish response to Lurlene's advances shows just what a decent, family loving man he is." [...] A reviewer for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram called the episode [...] "heartwarming", and commented that The Simpsons [...] "once again shows that {{at the heart of}} this crazy family there is an abiding love." [...] Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club said [...] "it's a pretty impossible question for a die-hard fan, but if I were forced at gunpoint to name my favorite episode ever, 'Colonel Homer' <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> first to leap to mind, if only for the pure joy that is 'Bagged Me a Homer'." ...|$|E

500|$|Rubano came up {{with the}} main riff for [...] "Capital M-E," [...] which Lazzara called [...] "too easy" [...] after hearing it for the first time, [...] "like it needs {{something}} else". Rubano was adamant, saying [...] "work on it, we'll figure it out". While Reyes compared it to Weezer, Rubano compared it to early Taking Back Sunday, in the sense that [...] "it's a very simple song and about the energy you put behind it". Lyrically, it was inspired by a comment Mascherino made during an interview after leaving the band: [...] " [...] more about cooking food than making music." [...] Lazzara said, [...] "it <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> first and last time that I'll go in-depth about that subject". [...] "Carpathia" [...] was named after the ship RMS Carpathia, which was the first ship to hear a distress call from the RMS Titanic. With the lyrics, Lazzara said he tried to be [...] "really obvious with it". The track features a bass solo, which was originally suggested by Fazzi and Lazzara. [...] "Everything Must Go" [...] details the split between Lazzara and DuPree. The title originally appeared as a lyric in an early draft of the song. Lazzara called [...] "Didn't See That Coming" [...] "really slow and almost haunting". Lazzara said it was a prequel to [...] "Cut Me Up Jenny." ...|$|E
2500|$|This list {{attempts}} {{to follow a}} phylogenetic order.

The first two lineages (and possibly the flightless cormorant) are basal and cannot be assigned to either subfamily.|$|E
2500|$|Note {{that the}} {{official}} California El Camino Real route misses most of the original 21 missions.

2500|$|The {{character}} was originally {{designed as a}} bad girl the audience could hate, but was later presented as a [...] "flawed good girl."

[...] "I love when she's pumped and she's like a cheerleader, seeing the good in everything," [...] she said. Of Babe's darker moments, Havins stated, [...] "My favorite moment of Babe down — just emotionally beat up and dragged through the dirt — <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> moment at the river with Krystal," [...] the moment Babe is told her baby has died. [...] "...I loved when Little Adam almost drowned [...] There was this vulnerable side of her that hadn't come out for a while," [...] she said. [...] "And I loved playing that because that was a range of emotions between loving your child, being scared to death, hating your husband for not being responsible, etc. There was not one set way of thought or feeling in those scenes." ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{the former}} {{nationalist}} turned Japanese puppet regime forces, these warlords and their troops {{had no problem}} of following Chiang Kai-shek’s orders, and they were eager to prove themselves. [...] These warlords and their troops were well aware that due to the collaboration with the Japanese invaders during the Second Sino-Japanese War, they were well hated by the general population in China, including those nationalists who refused to surrender to the enemy and fought the enemy until the eventual victory. [...] Therefore, in the impending demilitarization after World War II, they were certainly be disarmed and discharged, which <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> best outcome {{and the power of}} these warlord would be reduced or even completely eliminated as a result. [...] Chiang Kai-shek’s ordering them not surrendering to the communists and fighting off the communists was a savior for them because by carrying out such orders, these warlords and their troops could legitimize themselves and thus retain their power by fighting the communists who were targeted as rebels by Chiang Kai-shek and his nationalist regime.|$|E
2500|$|Mr Justice Woolf's {{judgment}} on 16 April {{observed that the}} council [...] "have determined, irrespective of their legal duty, {{not to make a}} rate". Having decided that this was unlawful, he then grappled with the issue of the discretion available to the council of when to set its rate which he found the council had to use reasonably and in the interests of ratepayers. Woolf again declined to issue an order of mandamus compelling the council to set a rate, instead stating that he would do so unless Hackney indicated it would make a rate within an acceptable timescale. After hearing submissions about what such a timescale would be, he decided to give the council [...] "a relatively liberal period of time in which to give effect to this judgment" [...] and fixed the end of May as the deadline. On 2 May, Hackney also lost its appeal against the ruling in its own judicial review challenge of the Secretary of State's spending guidance, and was refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords. The council was warned by the borough solicitor that the legal costs of attempting further legal challenge <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> subject of a surcharge of councillors.|$|E
