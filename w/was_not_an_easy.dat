5|$|The 6th Airborne Division, {{now with}} the commandos of the 1st Special Service Brigade under command, had to defend the Orne bridgehead. This <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> task as it had to face {{elements}} of the 21st Panzer Division {{from the south and}} the 346th and 711th Infantry Divisions from the east.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> {{introduction}} to the front for the New Zealanders. On arriving in their sector, they found the defensive arrangements to be poor and immediately set about improving the trenches and wire emplacements. Although {{the bulk of the}} division's personnel manned secondary defences rearward of the front line to avoid the German artillery, the forward areas had to be constantly patrolled as a deterrent to an attack and to give the impression they were fully manned. The static nature of the war meant that the Divisional Mounted Troops, intended to be used as scouts, were redundant and, along with two Light Horse squadrons from the Australian infantry divisions, were soon transferred to a new formation designated 1st ANZAC Light Horse Regiment. In July, the New Zealand Division was transferred to the newly arrived II ANZAC Corps while I ANZAC moved south to the Somme.|$|E

5|$|The State President of the South African Republic, Paul Kruger, <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> man to work with, and in {{some circles}} it was {{predicted}} that Reitz would quickly find himself subordinated to Kruger. This was not the case, however. On occasion the two men clashed on matters of policy, but Reitz remained true to his own convictions, gaining some influence over Kruger in the process. Originally praised by the British for his diplomatic courtesy, their attitude quickly changed when they understood that Reitz was a protagonist of Transvaal independence. Reitz was sometimes rather brazen in his political statements, so when he – incorrectly – claimed the South African Republic to be a fully sovereign state, the British jumped on him.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> {{place to}} defend without artillery, as the plains made surprise attacks difficult. Except for the convent itself, the terrain {{did not offer}} any natural barriers that the patriots could exploit. Nevertheless, the flat terrain was ideal for cavalry manoeuvres, and {{the distance between the}} church and the west gully gave enough room for a cavalry charge. The royalists, on the other hand, could support their troops with their ships from the river. Without a supporting navy, or local batteries, San Martín had no means to attack the ships. Although the small path allowed them passage to the ships, it could force the royalist forces to bottleneck during a retreat while the long range guns of the ships protected them. San Martín studied the battlefield and readied the plan for the operation during the night, when the grenadiers were hidden inside the convent.|$|E
5|$|In essence, the lbw law {{remained}} the same between 1839 and 1937, despite several campaigns to have it changed. An 1863 proposal to allow a batsman to be lbw if the ball hit his body at any point between the wickets, regardless of where the ball pitched or whether it would hit the wicket at all, came to nothing. There were few complaints until the proportion of lbw dismissals in county cricket began to increase during the 1880s. Until then, batsmen used their pads only to protect their legs; their use for any other purposes was considered unsporting, and some amateur cricketers did not wear them at all. As cricket became more organised and competitive, some batsmen began to use their pads as a second line of defence: they lined them up with the ball so that if they missed with the bat, the ball struck the pad instead of the wicket. Some players took this further; if the delivery <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> one from which to score runs, they attempted no shot and allowed the ball to bounce safely off their pads. Arthur Shrewsbury was the first prominent player to use such methods, and others followed. Criticism of this practice was heightened by the increased quality and reliability of cricket pitches, which made batting easier, led to higher scores and created a perceived imbalance in the game.|$|E

Nevertheless, Wessels succeeded in making his administration a success, and in 1919 the Union government proposed him for a knighthood, which he received in the 1920 New Year Honours.|$|E
