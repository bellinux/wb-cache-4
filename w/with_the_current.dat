A combination of observations and theory suggest that the first quasars and galaxies formed about a billion years after the Big Bang, and since then, larger structures have been forming, such as galaxy clusters and superclusters.|$|E
5|$|Developer {{communities}} {{have used the}} SDK to port later versions of Windows Mobile OS to older devices and making the OS images available for free, thus providing the devices <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> feature set. Microsoft has tolerated this procedure for some time but decided in February 2007 to ask developers to take their OS images off the net, which in turn raised discussions. At the same time Microsoft offered upgrades to Windows Mobile 6 versions to manufacturers for free.|$|E

40|$|Two {{principal}} schemes of CW {{high current}} linac design based on superconductivity use are proposed. Superconducting accelerating structures are suggested to use along the whole linac for acceleration of beams <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>currents</b> up to 30 mA. Focusing by longitudinal magnetic field generated by superconducting solenoids are suggested {{to use for}} <b>the</b> beams <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>currents</b> up to 500 mA. It is shown that in both cases accelerator efficiency is higher than 50 % and beam losses is lower than 10 - 5. Problems of accelerator main system design and its resolution are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Moorish idols are pelagic spawners; that is, they release {{eggs and}} sperm {{in the water}} column, leaving fertilized eggs to drift away <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>currents.</b> <b>The</b> range of these fish may be {{explained}} by the unusually long larval stage. The fish reach a length of 7.5 cm before becoming free-swimming juveniles.|$|R
50|$|Presumed to be pelagic spawners, {{threadfins}} probably release many tiny, buoyant {{eggs into}} the water column, which then {{become part of the}} plankton. The eggs float freely <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>currents</b> until hatching.|$|R

5|$|The {{original}} {{plans for}} the expressway dating back to 1969 were for it to travel from current County Road 22, heading west along {{the southern edge of}} Belle River and Tecumseh, meeting up <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> two-lane freeway alignment (Pike Creek Bypass) just east of Puce, as well as having the west end continue south through Lasalle to north of Amherstburg.|$|E
5|$|The park in this {{community}} area was named for President George Washington in 1880. In the 1920s, the University of Chicago created the community area system of city subdivision <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> names that continue to be used today. The community areas although not formally adopted by the United States Census Bureau are largely consistent with census tract boundaries. The Washington Park community area and its census tracts have been unchanged.|$|E
5|$|The {{police service}} {{dates to the}} 13th century when the first sheriffs were {{appointed}}. As the first city in Norway to do so, Trondheim had a chief of police appointed in 1686, and Oslo established a uniformed police corps in 1859. The directorate is led by National Police Commissioner Odd Reidar Humlegård. Police districts were introduced in 1894, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> structure dating from 2003.|$|E
50|$|In {{the north}} of its range, {{breeding}} takes place from April to June. Large numbers of small eggs are produced and fertilisation is external. The bipinnaria larvae that develop from these form part of the zooplankton and disperse <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>currents.</b>|$|R
50|$|The surface flow for <b>the</b> Malvinas <b>Current</b> after <b>the</b> {{collision}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Brazil <b>Current</b> is {{much simpler}} {{than that of}} <b>the</b> Brazil <b>Current.</b> Once <b>the</b> Malvinas <b>Current</b> collides <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Brazil <b>Current</b> at <b>the</b> Brazil-Malvinas Confluence Zone <b>the</b> Malvinas <b>Current</b> gets redirected poleward.

50|$|It is an ocean-going {{species and}} {{spends most of}} its life far from land, {{travelling}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>currents</b> and migrating to areas where upwellings of nutrient-rich water increase the availability of zooplankton. The oceanic manta ray is often in association with offshore oceanic islands.|$|R
5|$|Although the cheetah is an African cat, {{molecular}} {{evidence indicates}} that the three species of the Puma lineage evolved in North America two to three million years ago, where they possibly had a common ancestor during the Miocene. They possibly diverged from this ancestor 8.25 million years ago. The cheetah diverged from the puma and the jaguarundi around 6.7 million years ago. A genome study concluded that cheetahs experienced two genetic bottlenecks in their history, the first about 100,000 years ago and the second about 12,000 years ago, greatly lowering their genetic variability. These bottlenecks may {{have been associated with}} migrations across Asia and into Africa (<b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> African population founded about 12,000 years ago), and/or with a depletion of prey species {{at the end of the}} Pleistocene.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1980 the {{eligibility}} year for nominations {{was set to}} the calendar year, rather than December–November as initially conceived, and the SFWA organizing panel was allowed to add an additional work. Authors were also allowed to use the mass-market paperback publication of their books {{as the beginning of}} their nomination period, rather than the initial hardback publication. As a consequence of the combination of this rule and the rolling eligibility, the 2007 awards, despite nominally being for works published in 2006, instead were all given to works initially published in 2005. Beginning with the 2010 awards, the rolling eligibility system and paperback publication exemption were replaced <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> rules.|$|E
40|$|We study {{a tunnel}} contact {{that acts as}} charge {{detector}} for a single-electron transistor (SET) focusing on correlations between <b>the</b> detector <b>current</b> and <b>the</b> <b>current</b> through <b>the</b> SET.

50|$|These {{jellyfish}} swim in jerks by contracting their circular and radial muscles, which {{decreases the}} volume of water enclosed under the bell, before relaxing them again and repeating the sequence.

50|$|Both asexual {{reproduction}} by budding and sexual reproduction {{take place in}} Arthuria canariensis. As in other species, each sponge is a hermaphrodite. Sperm is liberated into the sea and some is drawn into other sponges <b>with</b> <b>the</b> water <b>current</b> that passes through them. Fertilisation is then internal and the eggs are brooded in the ascon tubes of the sponge until they hatch. The free-swimming larvae are expelled through the osculi and disperse <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>currents.</b> After a few days they settle on the seabed and develop into juvenile sponges.|$|R
