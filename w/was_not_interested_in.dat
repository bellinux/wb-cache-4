5|$|The Avalanche's success came amid {{considerable}} {{turmoil in}} the front office. COMSAT's diversification into sports ownership was proving a drain on the company. In particular, cost overruns associated {{with the construction of}} Pepsi Center had shareholders up in arms. Finally, in 1997, COMSAT agreed in principle to sell Ascent to Liberty Media. However, Liberty <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> sports ownership at the time (though it has since bought Major League Baseball's Atlanta Braves), and made the deal contingent upon Ascent selling the Avalanche and Nuggets.|$|E

5|$|A {{sequel to}} Resurrection was planned as Joss Whedon had written an earth-set script for Alien 5, though Sigourney Weaver <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> this setting, but has {{remained}} open to reprise {{her role as}} Ellen Ripley for a fifth installment {{on the condition that}} she likes the story. Although more sequels were planned to follow Resurrection, the series became a prequel series with the 2012 film Prometheus directed by Ridley Scott, who stated that the film precedes the story of Alien, but is not directly connected to the original film's franchise, and that Prometheus explores its own mythology and ideas.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{releasing}} the PC version, Virgin <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> publishing {{the game on}} the PlayStation, feeling that only 3D games would sell for the console. As a result, Cecil contacted Sony Computer Entertainment, who agreed to release the game for the console. In North America, Broken Sword was renamed to Circle of Blood. Cecil was uneasy about the name change, feeling that it gave a wrong impression of what type of game it was. In 1998 however, THQ published the game on the PlayStation platform under its original Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars title.|$|E

5|$|Fisher {{wanted to}} {{continue}} to serve as High Commissioner in London when his term expired in 1921, but Hughes did not permit it. Upon his return to Australia, there were attempts to secure Fisher a seat in parliament and lead the Labor Party once more, but he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> doing so. In 1922 he returned to London and lived in retirement at South Hill Park, Hampstead, {{for the remainder of}} his life. In his final years, Fisher gradually succumbed to the effects of dementia, such that he would ultimately lose the ability to even sign his own name. He caught a severe bout of influenza in September 1928 and died a month later. He is buried at Hampstead Cemetery in West Hampstead.|$|E
5|$|From Campobello, Eddy sailed up the Saint John River to Maugerville, where 27 {{men were}} recruited, {{and then up}} to the Maliseet {{settlement}} at Aukpaque (just upriver from present-day Fredericton).

Eddy was able to convince Ambroise St. Aubin, one of Tomah's competitors, and 15 men to join the expedition in exchange for {{an agreement with the}} Maugerville community to support the families of those men. In another disappointment, none of the local Acadians joined, contrary to assertions St. Aubin had made to Eddy during a previous visit to the area.|$|E

5|$|In February 1942, Shaughnessy {{traveled}} to Yale University, which was considering three candidates for its vacant head coaching position. A month later, {{he said he}} <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> Yale, but that he might move to an unnamed Eastern school with little football tradition. Shaughnessy resigned in March 1942 to move to Maryland. A 1977 Sports Illustrated article reported {{that he decided to}} leave when he realized Stanford might discontinue its football program during World War II. He expressed disappointment about leaving, but believed the new job would provide a challenge. Maryland reportedly offered the same salary as Stanford, $9,000 ($ adjusted for inflation), and a position on its faculty.|$|E
5|$|Mentzer and Mohan {{also wrote}} {{a series of}} generic RPG {{adventure}}s called Gary Gygax Presents Fantasy Master. They also began working on a third line of products, which began with an adventure written by Mentzer called The Convert (1987); Mentzer had written the adventure as an RPGA tournament for D, but TSR <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> publishing it. Mentzer got verbal permission to publish it with New Infinities, but since the permission was not in writing TSR filed an injunction to prevent the adventure's sale, although the injunction was later lifted. The legal costs further drained NIPI of capital.|$|E
5|$|On 19 August, a {{proposed}} move to Werder Bremen failed {{to come to}} fruition after the club's sporting director Klaus Allofs declared that the club <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> Ben Arfa, despite reports of Werder Bremen offering Marseille a transfer fee of €8million. On 27 August, Dassier confirmed that the club had reached an agreement on a loan fee with Newcastle for the transfer of Ben Arfa with personal terms being the only stumbling block in the deal. Marseille agreed to a £2million loan fee. Newcastle had been set to pay Marseille another £5million if Ben Arfa had made 25 club appearances in the 2010–11 season, which {{would have made the}} transfer permanent.|$|E

5|$|Tobin began {{performing}} live {{shows in}} clubs with other Ninja Tune artists after releasing his second album, Bricolage. His shows generally contained music {{that he had}} produced during his career, mixed with modified songs from drum and bass, hip-hop, or other genres. Because his music was entirely produced in a studio with electronics, Tobin <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> adapting his music to suit a Live PA incorporating musicians. He instead used turntables which he felt had {{more in common with}} his approach to music production. He is known for building Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound speaker systems for his performances.|$|E
5|$|After Ali's death, the Shias of Iraq {{declared}} Ali's {{eldest son}} Hasan {{the successor to}} Ali, thus proclaiming him as their new caliph. However, Hasan <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> becoming caliph, and to prevent further bloodshed, he signed the Hasan–Muawiya treaty and abdicated in favor of Muawiyah, who became the first caliph of the Umayyad caliphate. Muawiyah died in Medina {{at the age of}} forty-five in 669, and was succeeded by Yazid I in 61 AH (680 CE) but Hasan's brother Husayn ibn Ali refused to accept Yazid's leadership. After being invited by the Shiites of Iraq in the same year, Husayn started his march to Iraq. However, during their stay at Karbala, his army was massacred by Yazid at the Battle of Karbala on 10 Muharram (10 October) and his death is commemorated by Shia every year during Muharram.|$|E

5|$|After graduating, Dawkins did a post {{graduate}} {{year at the}} New Hampton School in New Hampton, New Hampshire where he averaged 12.3 points and 3.6 rebounds before receiving a late scholarship offer from Michigan. His grades were not sufficient to pursue a scholarship at Stanford and despite his relationship with Chris Collins, Northwestern <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> Dawkins given their commitments from wings Vic Law and Scottie Lindsey. While at New Hampton, he was being recruited by Steve Donahue of Boston College, but Donahue left Boston College in 2014 and recommended Dawkins to Beilein. Before Michigan stepped in, it appeared {{that he would have}} committed to Dayton, although he was also considering Utah State, Pepperdine as well as Montana, and Rhode Island was showing a strong interest. In fact, during the 2014 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, Dawkins attended the Sweet 16 round to watch his father's Stanford Cardinal play Dayton in the South Regional on March 27. Dawkins accepted a recruiting visit to Michigan in early April 2014 when he received his scholarship offer. He made his verbal commitment on April 28 and signed his National Letter of Intent on May 9.|$|E
5|$|Apart from a cameo role in {{the comedy}} The Ladies Man, Moore's only other {{appearance}} in 2000 was in a short-film adaptation of Samuel Beckett's play Not I. In early 2001, she appeared as FBI Agent Clarice Starling in Hannibal, a sequel to the Oscar winning film The Silence of the Lambs. Jodie Foster had declined to reprise the role, and director Ridley Scott eventually cast Moore, over Angelina Jolie, Cate Blanchett, Gillian Anderson, and Helen Hunt. The change in actress received considerable attention from the press, but Moore claimed she <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> upstaging Foster. Despite mixed reviews, Hannibal earned $58 million in its opening weekend and finished as the tenth-highest-grossing film of the year. Moore starred in three more 2001 releases: with David Duchovny in the science fiction–comedy Evolution, in her husband's dramatic film World Traveler, and with Kevin Spacey, Judi Dench, and Cate Blanchett in The Shipping News. All three films were poorly received.|$|E

Congressman Daniel had become convinced that the U.S. military establishment <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> special operations, that the country's capability in this area was second rate, and that SOF operational command and control was an endemic problem. Senators Nunn and Cohen also felt strongly that the Department of Defense was not preparing adequately for future threats. Senator Cohen agreed that the U.S. needed a clearer organizational focus and chain of command for special operations to deal with low-intensity conflicts.|$|E
