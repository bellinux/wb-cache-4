25|$|A {{few years}} later, Cable got sacked {{from the band}} and {{a few weeks after}} that when on a bus, he waved to Jones who was {{standing}} at a bus stop and <b>waved</b> <b>back.</b> It was the first contact they had since Zephyr had broken up. Two weeks later, Jones and Cable started speaking again in the Ivy Bush. They agreed to give the band another go but Cable only wanted to play their own songs, to which Jones agreed. The duo invited Mark Everett to play for them on bass guitar and Jones then started writing his own songs.|$|E
25|$|She {{was dressed}} for {{traveling}} and for cold weather. Her hood {{was large and}} round and red but not smooth, — it was corrugated; that is to say, it consisted {{of a series of}} rolls nearly as large as my arm, passing over her head sidewise, growing smaller toward the back until they terminated in a big button that was embellished with a knot of green ribbon. Its general appearance was not unlike that of the familiar, pictorial beehive except that the rolls were not arranged spirally. The broad, white ruffle of her lace cap projected several inches beyond the front of the hood and <b>waved</b> <b>back</b> and forth like the single leaves of a great white poppy, as she nodded emphatically in her discourse.|$|E
25|$|Like the clans Mackenzie and Macleod, the Lewis Macaulays did {{not support}} the Jacobites during the {{conflicts}} of the 1745–46 rebellion. According to Matheson, Donald Òg son of the tacksman of Brenish, and great-grandson of Dòmhnall Cam, was said to have fought for the Government at the Battle of Culloden. Matheson however thought this unlikely, and stated that the Independent Company raised on Lewis for service to the Crown never joined the others under the command of the Earl of Loudoun. One Lewis tradition in explanation for this was that when the mustered Lewismen sailed across The Minch they were <b>waved</b> <b>back</b> at Poolewe by the Earl of Seaforth. According to the tradition, Seaforth used a sheep's jawbone to wave back the Lewismen, and in the process supposedly fulfilled a prophecy of the Brahan Seer.|$|E

500|$|The piece {{opened in}} {{conjunction}} with {{the annual meeting of the}} Music Critics Association, guaranteeing what the Houston Chronicle described as a [...] "very discriminating audience". [...] Members of the association also attended meetings with the opera's production team. [...] When Carolann Page, originating Pat Nixon, waved to the audience in character as First Lady, many <b>waved</b> <b>back</b> at her. Adams responded to complaints that the words were difficult to understand (no supertitles were provided) by indicating that it is not necessary that all the words be understood on first seeing an opera. [...] The audience's general reaction was expressed by what the Los Angeles Times termed [...] "polite applause", the descent of the Spirit of '76 being the occasion for clapping from both the onstage chorus and from the viewers in the opera house.|$|E
500|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, the Royal Serbian Army had only three planes, {{one of which was}} piloted by Tomić. His plane was quite primitive even for 1914. Misha Glenny, a journalist who has written extensively on the Balkans, likens it to [...] "a box kite on perambulator wheels". At the beginning of the war, Tomić was attached to the 1st Danube Division. On the afternoon of 12 August 1914, he flew a reconnaissance mission over Šabac, and disclosed to the Serbian High Command that, contrary to initial reports, the Austro-Hungarians had not set up pontoon bridges on the Sava and were attempting to cross the river with boats. On 15 August, Tomić encountered an enemy plane while conducting a reconnaissance flight over Austria-Hungary. The Austro-Hungarian aviator initially waved at Tomić, who <b>waved</b> <b>back.</b> The enemy pilot then took a revolver and began shooting at Tomić's plane. Tomić produced a pistol of his own and fired back. He swerved away from the Austro-Hungarian plane and the two aircraft eventually parted ways. This incident is considered the first recorded dogfight of the war. Within weeks, all Serbian and Austro-Hungarian aircraft were armed. The Serbians equipped their planes with [...] Schwarzlose MG M.07/12 machine guns, six 100-round boxes of ammunition and several bombs. The first armed Serbian plane was given the name OЛУЈ (Oluj), or [...] "storm". It was mostly flown by Tomić.|$|E

2500|$|Taking full {{advantage}} of his [...] "trusty" [...] status, Alton escaped with a fellow inmate in a prison vehicle marked [...] "Registrar of Motor Vehicles" [...] on 26 August 1958, the day after Floyd Powell started his job as warden. [...] The two prisoners waved to the new warden on their way past the prison, and Powell <b>waved</b> <b>back.</b> [...] By the time the warden realized what had happened, Alton and his confederate were {{too far away to}} do anything. [...] Alton managed to stay hidden until November 1958, when he was apprehended in his hometown of Culbertson. [...] He was remanded to the prison and spent time in the hole, then more time in segregation. [...] It was during this time that he met, and had extensive conversations with, Jerry Myles, who had been placed in the cell right next to Alton's in segregation.|$|E
