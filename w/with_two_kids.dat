25|$|Pamela George was a 28-year-old Ojibwe woman <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>kids,</b> {{providing}} {{for herself and}} her family as a sex worker. On April 18, 1995, she was murdered outside of Regina, by Alex Ternowetsky and Steven Kummerfield, two 20-year-old white men attending college. The men picked her up in their car, drove her to the outskirts of Regina where they forced her to perform oral sex, and proceeded to beat her for 45 minutes to one hour. George succumbed to these injuries and was found dead in a muddy ditch outside of Regina. Due to the severity of the beatings George's family chose to have a close-casket funeral. On January 31, 1997, both men were convicted of manslaughter and were sentenced to 6 {{and a half years in}} prison.|$|E
500|$|Keith Caufield of Billboard {{noted the}} song [...] "doesn't take itself too seriously. Halfway through the number, the luckiest rapper in the world, Sabi, appears, inexplicably rhyming 'sweatin' you' with 'vegetables'," [...] while Digital Spy's Robert Copsey {{considered}} it [...] "self-assured". The A.V. Clubs Genevieve Koski commented that [...] "inane lyrical premises like those" [...] on the song [...] "are salvaged by the mightiest of hooks, pummeling the listener into lobotomized musical escapism". David Buchanan of Consequence of Sound said both [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] and [...] "I Wanna Go" [...] "brings Dirty Vegas memories, plus phoning in that Far East Movement 'Like a G6' backing track {{would have been}} put to better use with Spears' producers". Thomas Conner of the Chicago Sun-Times noted Spears [...] "drags her down low as if she's Rihanna" [...] in the song. MTV writer Eliot Glazer said that, [...] "even as a mom <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>kids,</b> Britney still manages to ooze sex appeal in [...] "Beautiful," [...] cementing her place as the world's number one MILF". Hannah Rishel of The Daily Collegian said [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] was [...] "possibly [...] favorite song on the album", commenting that [...] "it's cheesy and ridiculous, but Spears makes it work in the song". Following the release of Femme Fatale, [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] reached number forty-one on South Korea's Gaon International Chart, after selling 7,500 digital units of the song alone. The song also appeared on Billboards Dance/Electronic Digital Songs chart on the week of April 23, 2011.|$|E

2500|$|Eves' campaigning {{followed}} a straightforward pattern. Eves would highlight {{one of the}} five elements of the platform and then attack Dalton McGuinty for opposing it. For instance, he would visit the middle-class home of a visible minority couple <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>kids</b> and talk about how much money they would get under his mortgage deducatability plan. That would be followed by an attack on McGuinty for having a secret plan to raise their taxes. Or he would campaign in a small town assembly plant and talk about how under a [...] "Made-in-Ontario" [...] immigration plan fewer new Canadians would settle in Toronto and more outside the city, helping the plant manager with his labour shortage. Then he would link McGuinty to Prime Minister of Canada Jean Chr√©tien and say McGuinty supported the federal immigration system that allows terrorists and criminals into the country.|$|E
2500|$|In 1946, when he {{was barely}} four years old, Connolly's mother {{abandoned}} her children while their father was serving as an engineer in the Royal Air Force in Burma. [...] "I've never felt abandoned by her", Connolly explained in 2009. [...] "My mother was a teenager. My father was in Burma, fighting a bloody war. The Germans were dropping all kinds of crap on the town. We lived at the docks, so that's where all the bombs were happening. She was a teenager <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>kids</b> in a slum. A guy comes along and says, 'I love you. Come with me.' Given the choice, I think I'd have gone with him. It looks as though it might all end next Wednesday, from where you're standing.

6000|$|The {{hill was}} sparsely inhabited, and covered chiefly by gardens; {{but in one}} spot {{was a piece of}} rough ground jagged with great stones, which had never been {{cultivated}} since a landslip had ruined some houses there {{towards the end of the}} thirteenth century. Just above the edge of this broken ground stood a queer little square building, looking like a truncated tower roofed in with fluted tiles, and close by was a small outhouse, apparently built up against a piece of ruined stone wall. Under a large half-dead mulberry-tree that was now sending its last fluttering leaves in at the open doorways, a shrivelled, hardy old woman was untying a goat <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>kids,</b> and Baldassarre could see that part of the outbuilding was occupied by live stock; but the door of the other part was open, and it was empty of everything but some tools and straw. It was just the sort of place he wanted. He spoke to the old woman; but it was not till he got close to her and shouted in her ear, that he succeeded in making her understand his want of a lodging, and his readiness to pay for it. At first he could get no answer beyond shakes of the head and the words, [...] "No--no lodging," [...] uttered in the muffled tone of the deaf. But, by dint of persistence, he made clear to her that he was a poor stranger from a long way over seas, and could not afford to go to hostelries; that he only wanted to lie on the straw in the outhouse, and would pay her a quattrino or two a week for that shelter. She still looked at him dubiously, shaking her head and talking low to herself; but presently, as if a new thought occurred to her, she fetched a hatchet from the house, and, showing him a chump that lay half covered with litter in a corner, asked him if he would chop that up for her: if he would, he might lie in the outhouse for one night. He agreed, and Monna Lisa stood with her arms akimbo to watch him, with a smile of gratified cunning, saying low to herself-- ...|$|E
