5|$|Since the 20th century, actual metal corsets have {{occasionally}} {{been made}} for contemporary wear, although such instances are rare. Steele notes that alongside a 1930s metal corset made for and worn by a fetish corsetiere called Cayne, the late 20th- and early 21st-century tight-lacer Cathie Jung had a silver corset-cover made to wear over her actual laced corset. Between 1933 and 1940 Mrs. Cayne advertised a booklet describing her 14-inch <b>waistline</b> and offered other services in the Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News.|$|E
5|$|Whale tail is the Y-shaped {{waistband}} of a thong or G-string when visible above the <b>waistline</b> of low-rise jeans, shorts, or a skirt {{that resembles a}} whale's tail. Intentionally or unintentionally, a whale tail is exposed above the trousers mostly when sitting or bending, or even while standing. The frequency or occasion depends on the style of trousers, the style of underwear, {{and the way they}} are worn. Displaying whale tails became popular in the early 2000s, together with the rise of low-rise jeans and thong underwear. The trend, popularized by a number of female celebrities including Christina Aguilera, Victoria Beckham, Mariah Carey, Paris Hilton and Britney Spears, waned within the decade.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, the bikini {{swimsuit}} influenced panty {{styles and}} {{coincided with the}} cut of the new lower rise jeans and pants. In the seventies, {{with the emergence of}} skintight jeans, thong versions of the panty became mainstream, since the open, stringed back eliminated any tell-tale panty lines across the rear and hips. By the 1980s the design of the French-cut panty pushed the waistband back up to the natural <b>waistline</b> {{and the rise of the}} leg openings was nearly as high (French Cut panties come up to the waist, has a high cut leg, and usually are full in the rear). As with the bra and other type of lingerie, manufacturers of the last quarter of the century marketed panty styles that were designed primarily for their sexual allure. From this decade sexualization and eroticization of the male body was on the rise. The male body was celebrated through advertising campaigns for brands such as Calvin Klein, particularly by photographers Bruce Weber and Herb Ritts. Male bodies and men's undergarments were commodified and packaged for mass consumption, and swimwear and sportswear were influenced by sports photography and fitness. Over time, swimwear evolved from weighty wool to high-tech skin-tight garments, eventually cross-breeding with sportswear, underwear and exercise wear, resulting in the interchangeable fashions of the 1990s.|$|E
5000|$|Hourglass corsets {{first became}} fashionable in the 1830s in Europe and the US. In {{contrast}} to Empire or late Georgian <b>waistlines</b> {{in which the}} [...] "waist" [...] lies just below the bust, Victorian fashion accentuated natural <b>waistlines</b> but further constricted them.|$|R

25|$|The style had waxed and waned {{in fashion}} for {{hundreds}} of years. The shape of the dresses also helped to lengthen the body’s appearance. The clothing can also be draped to maximize the bust. Lightweight fabrics were typically {{used to create a}} flowing effect. Also, ribbon, sash, and other decorative features were used to highlight the <b>waistline.</b> The empire gowns were often with low neckline and short sleeves and women usually worn them as evening dresses. On the other hand, day gowns had higher neckline and long sleeves. The chemisette was a staple for fashionable ladies. Although there were differences between day dresses and evening dresses, the high <b>waistline</b> was not changed.|$|E
25|$|The {{pelerine}} was {{a popular}} name for wide, capelike collars that extended over the shoulders and covered the upper chest. Sometimes they had layers of tiered fabric, long front panels hanging down from center front, or were also belted at the natural <b>waistline.</b>|$|E

25|$|At {{the start}} of the decade, the sides of bodices stopped at the natural <b>waistline,</b> and met at a point in the front. In {{accordance}} with the heavily boned corset and seam lines on the bodice as well, the popular low and narrow waist was thus accentuated.|$|E
25|$|The Islanders {{debuted in}} 1972 with traditional-style jerseys: one was white with orange and royal blue stripes near the <b>waistline</b> {{and on the}} sleeves, the other was royal blue with white and orange stripes.

25|$|Unlike most of {{the large}} moons, its overall shape is neither spherical nor ellipsoid, but has a bulging <b>waistline</b> and {{squashed}} poles; also, its unique equatorial ridge (see below) is so high that it visibly distorts Iapetus's shape even when viewed from a distance. These features often lead it to be characterized as walnut-shaped.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} half of the 1820s, there were slight gradual {{modifications}} of Regency styles, with the position of the <b>waistline</b> trending successively lower than the high <b>waistline</b> of the Regency (just below the breasts), and also further development of the trends of the late 1810s towards giving skirts a somewhat conical silhouette (as opposed to earlier more clinging and free-flowing styles), and in having various types of decoration (sometimes large and ornate) applied horizontally around the dress near the hem. Sleeves also began increasing in size, foreshadowing the styles of the 1830s. However, there was still no radical break with the Empire/Regency aesthetic. Skirts became even wider at the bottom during the 1820s, with more ornamentation and definition toward the bottom of the skirt such as tucks, pleats, ruffles, or loops of silk or fur.|$|E
25|$|Males of some {{indigenous}} {{tribes of}} the Amazon Basin live nude {{except for a}} light string worn around the <b>waistline.</b> This is used to conceal the foreskin of the penis from females, which is considered taboo in communal settings.

5|$|Wasps {{have been}} {{modelled}} in jewellery {{since at least}} the nineteenth century, when diamond and emerald wasp brooches were made in gold and silver settings.

25|$|This is an {{advanced}} technique {{that takes a}} little more than four and half hours to perform. Conventional abdominoplasty tightens muscles in a vertical line. In this new method, known as high lateral tension abdominoplasty, in addition to vertical-line tightening, muscles are tightened horizontally. The final result with this technique is a dramatically flat abdomen with significantly better-defined <b>waistline.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the 1820s, fashion changed again, {{with the}} <b>waistline</b> lowered back to almost the natural position. Corsets {{began to be}} made with some padding and more boning. Some women made their own, while others bought their corsets. Corsets {{were one of the}} first mass-produced {{garments}} for women. Corsets began to be more heavily boned in the 1840s. By 1850, steel boning became popular.|$|E
25|$|Corsets {{were used}} in women’s gowns for {{emphasizing}} the small waist of the female body. They function as an undergarment which can be adjusted to bound tightly around the waist, hold and train a person’s <b>waistline,</b> so to slim and conform it to a fashionable silhouette. It also helped stop the bodice from horizontal creasing. With the corset, a very small tight fitting waist would be shown.|$|E
50|$|During {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, however, <b>waistlines</b> moved higher as wide, flared, bell-bottoms {{gradually}} {{gave way to}} designer straight-legged jeans. Throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s, as more women entered the corporate workforce, the high waist design remained predominant, with commercial designers such as Gloria Vanderbilt and Calvin Klein at the forefront.|$|R
25|$|Doublets were {{pointed and}} fitted {{close to the}} body, with tight sleeves, to about 1615. Gradually <b>waistlines</b> rose and sleeves became fuller, and both body and upper sleeves might be slashed to show the shirt beneath.

25|$|Fashion in {{the period}} 1600–1650 in Western European {{clothing}} {{is characterized by the}} disappearance of the ruff in favour of broad lace or linen collars. <b>Waistlines</b> rose through the period for both men and women.

25|$|The 1968 XT model {{featured}} a mild facelift, with a divided grille, and inset driving lights for the GT. The GT also replaced the thick lower body stripes of the XR with narrow stripes along the <b>waistline</b> from grille to tail light. The tail lights were still round, {{but instead of}} the small round indicator of the XR, the XT model had a long indicator across the light. Otherwise, all external body panels and bumpers {{were the same as}} the XR.|$|E
25|$|Competitive acro dancers {{frequently}} wear costumes when {{performing at}} dance competitions. Acro costumes often have loose fabric pieces such as short skirts, but the sizes and locations of these pieces are carefully calculated {{to ensure that}} they pose no safety risks. As an extra safety measure, skirts are sometimes pinned or stitched at the back below the <b>waistline</b> so that they will not hang at full length when the dancer is inverted, as in hand walking; this prevents the skirt—which might otherwise become entangled in the dancer's hair or costume headpiece—from contacting the dancer's head.|$|E
25|$|In 1955, Healthways retailed Carib drysuits, made of 3-ply {{translucent}} gum rubber, {{and available}} in {{long and short}} versions. Entry was by a front chute with rubber band closure. The full version included an integral hood and covered the feet. In 1957, they added the Aqua King and Aqua Flite dry suits to their product range. The Aqua King suit was a full-length waist entry suit, comprising hood, long sleeved shirt, booted pants and <b>waistline</b> sealing ring, and was made of seamless latex rubber. All these suits were available in small medium and large sizes.|$|E
