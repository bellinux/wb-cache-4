25|$|At the Toray Pan Pacific Open, {{she lost}} to Caroline Wozniacki {{in the semifinals}} in three sets. Azarenka re-entered the Top 10 after this run. At the China Open, Azarenka retired in her second-round match to Timea Bacsinszky. At the 2010 Kremlin Cup Azarenka, as the second seed, {{defeated}} Maria Kirilenko in the final, coming back from 4–0 down in the second set to win her fifth career title. Azarenka's performance in Moscow qualified her for the year-end 2010 WTA Tour Championships, where she <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Group as the eighth seed. In her first round-robin match, Azarenka lost to Vera Zvonareva, and then lost to Kim Clijsters in her second match. This assured {{that she did not}} qualify for the semifinals. In her final match of the tournament and season, she defeated Janković {{for the second year in}} a row. Azarenka ended the year as world No. 10, her second consecutive year-end top-10 finish. Azarenka then took part in a charitable exhibition match in mid-November with Caroline Wozniacki, beating the Dane at the Sports Palace in her hometown of Minsk.|$|E
500|$|Norma Lois Peterson, in {{her book}} on Tyler's presidency, {{suggested}} that Tyler's general lack of success as president was due to external factors that would have affected whoever <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House. Chief among them was Henry Clay, who was determined to realize the vision he had for America, and who would brook no opposition. In the aftermath of Jackson's determined use of {{the powers of the}} Executive Branch, the Whigs wanted the president to be dominated by Congress, and Clay treated Tyler as a subordinate. [...] Tyler resented this, leading to the conflict between the branches that dominated his presidency. Pointing to Tyler's advances in foreign policy, she deemed Tyler's presidency [...] "flawed... but... not a failure".|$|E

500|$|Moore briefly {{supported}} the Liberal Party in the 1950s, though condemned the Liberal Democrats, saying he believed they could alter their position radically {{and that they}} [...] "would happily join up with the BNP or the Socialist Workers Party... if [...] they could win a few extra votes." [...] He admired the Official Monster Raving Loony Party and was briefly their financial adviser. He wrote in his autobiography that Liechtenstein – a constitutional monarchy headed by a prince – had the best political system in the world. Moore was {{a critic of the}} Iraq War, and said [...] "the world was a safer place when Ronald Reagan <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House".

500|$|Sotomayor {{had wanted}} to become a judge since she was in {{elementary}} school, and in 1991 she was recommended for a spot by Democratic New York senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Moynihan had an unusual bipartisan arrangement with his fellow New York senator, Republican Al D'Amato, whereby he would get to choose roughly {{one out of every four}} New York district court seats even though a Republican <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House. Moynihan also wanted to fulfill a public promise he had made to get a Hispanic judge appointed for New York. When Moynihan's staff recommended her to him, they said [...] "Have we got a judge for you!" [...] Moynihan identified with her socio-economic and academic background and became convinced she would become the first Hispanic Supreme Court justice. D'Amato became an enthusiastic backer of Sotomayor, who was seen as politically centrist at the time. Of the impending drop in salary from private practice, Sotomayor said: [...] "I've never wanted to get adjusted to my income because I knew I wanted to go back to public service. And in comparison to what my mother earns and how I was raised, it's not modest at all." ...|$|E

The matter instantly occupied the news media, and Lewinsky spent the next weeks hiding from public attention in her mother's residence at the Watergate complex. News of Lewinsky's affair with Bleiler also came to light, and he turned over to Starr various souvenirs, photographs, and documents that Lewinsky had sent him and his wife during the time she <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House.|$|E

It <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> light of the morning he set out, and the time seemed long to him till he could get to Mary Lavelle's house. But when he came to it, he found the door broken, and the thatch dropping from the roof, and no living person to be seen. And when he asked the neighbours what had happened her, all they could say was that she had been put out of the house, and had married some labouring man, and they had gone looking for work to London or Liverpool or some big place. And whether she found a worse place or a better he never knew, but anyway he never met with her or with news of her again.|$|E
