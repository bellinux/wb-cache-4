5|$|During the {{discussion}} about deregulation, Braathens SAFE considered several possibilities to strengthen itself. In particular, it had discussions with the large European airlines Lufthansa, British Airways and KLM about an alliance, but these were rejected by Braathens SAFE, stating that the agreements <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> getting traffic to the partner's hub. Minister of Transport, Kjell Opseth and director of SAS in Norway, Jan Reinås, both proposed a merger between Braathens SAFE and SAS, {{to ensure that the}} company had a 100% market share on the primary routes before the merger. This would, according to them, secure that no foreign company could compete with the merged company. The proposal was rejected by Braathens SAFE's management. Still, negotiations started between the companies in 1992, although they were quickly abandoned. The press reported the price of Braathens SAFE to be NOK1.2 billion, but that this had been rejected as too expensive by SAS.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{his great}} wealth, David Astor lived modestly, putting his money {{to good use}} through a network of benefactions and charities. Although he proved a {{brilliant}} editor, he lacked the drive for profits like other newcomers to the business who took advantage to increase rapidly both their advertising and circulation {{at the expense of}} The Observer. When The Daily Telegraph launched a Sunday edition in 1961 it changed what had been a staid industry and the ensuing battles for advertising changed the character of how and what newspapers <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>about.</b> The aggressive marketing by The Sunday Times under Canadian newspaper tycoon Roy Thomson hurt circulation while the paper's unions were making repeated demands that drove costs to a point where the operation became an unsustainable business.|$|E

As an incentive, it offered to pay an extra 10% above the normal going rate for London office developments. Piano decided to take the commission because, as he put it, [...] "the client and the company involved <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> long lasting quality, without rushing.

500|$|Further {{discussing}} the film's visuals, Derrickson described influences as [...] "the Steve Ditko, Stan Lee comics [...] <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> these weird visuals", {{as well as}} [...] "a fair amount of surrealist art and photography and M.C. Escher". Additional inspiration for the film's visuals came from [...] "a bunch of experimental, fractal videos from YouTube" [...] that Derrickson found, and the mobile video game Monument Valley. Derrickson's [...] "ambition was to use cutting-edge visual effects {{to do things that}} are fresh and new—to not just blow things up." [...] Feige explained that one of the more difficult areas to be inventive was the action sequences, as Derrickson did not want them [...] "to simply be: someone shoots a bolt of lightning, and someone blocks a ball of lightning, so someone throws another bolt of lightning..." [...] Instead, they tried to incorporate the use of different dimensions into the action [...] "in the interest of creating a visual tapestry that is totally different in terms of an action scene we’ve seen in any other movies." [...] On the film's set pieces, Derrickson reiterated that the film's astral fight scene was based on The Oath comic, while adding that the end fight was [...] "an attempt to capture the quality of that artwork" [...] from the original comics, and the mirror dimension chase was an attempt to take Inception [...] "to the Nth degree and take it way more surreal and way farther. But I certainly owe something to that movie." [...] Specifically for the climax of the film, Derrickson wanted to play on the superhero trope of [...] "a big fight scene where they're tearing up a city, and there's a portal opening up and they have to close it", subverting it by having the villain defeated with an intelligent use of power rather than showing [...] "which CGI thing can hit the other CGI thing harder".|$|E

2500|$|In 1803 the Ahmednagar Fort was {{round in}} appearance, with twenty-four bastions, one large gate, and three small sally ports. It had a glacis, no covered way; a ditch, revetted with stone on both sides, about [...] wide, with [...] water all round, which only reached within 6 or [...] {{of the top}} of the scarp; long reeds grew in it all round. The berm was only about one yard wide. The rampart was of black hewn stone; the parapet of brick in chunam, and both {{together}} appeared from the crest of the glacis to be only as high as the pole of a field-officer's tent. The bastions <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> [...] feet higher; they were round. One of them mounted eight guns en barbet, pointing eastward; all the rest had jingies, four in each. In 1803 two guns were visible in each bastion, and 200 were said to be ready in the fort to be mounted.|$|E

2500|$|The comic series Predator and Aliens vs Predator: Three World War {{introduce}} a clan of Predators {{referred to as}} [...] "Killers", who are enemies of mainstream Predators (here referred to as [...] "Hunters") because of their tradition of training Aliens as attack animals rather than hunting them, {{as well as their}} desire for killing as opposed to honorable hunting. The character Machiko Noguchi notes in issue #1 of Three World War that [...] "You have to understand the mindset of the Hunters, and the honor they place on facing a worthy opponent on an equal footing... a kill is the end result, but it's not the point of a hunt.... For the 'Killers,' that wasn't the case. They <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> the killing." [...] They are first seen in the 2009 Predator series, where a number interfere in an East African civil war, coming into conflict with both humans and their Hunter counterparts. By the time of Three World War the Killers are assumed to have been wiped out by the Hunters, but some survive and begin attacking human colonies, forcing Noguchi to forge an alliance between humans and the Hunters {{in order to deal with}} them.|$|E
2500|$|He {{immediately}} {{calls to}} mind {{the start of his}} story - the night he met his wife, Linda Lee Thomas - Paris' latest divorcee and stunning beauty. From the start, they [...] "click" [...] and become a devoted couple. Linda is well aware of Cole's gay identity and activities; her [...] "ex" [...] was the same but violent with her. Cole is completely different, she declares on their wedding day - he loves and adores her and shows it, so she tolerates his dalliances. Her love for and devotion to him are strong enough for her to overlook his romantic flings outside their marriage. With Linda his fun with music turns into a top international career. Their lavish lifestyle is enviable worldwide. At film's end he tells her the songs <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> her - [...] "not all" [...] she corrects - but enough of them. The leaders in music praise his work and his amazing shows begin. Linda begins a tradition for his show opening nights - a Cartier cigarette case custom designed and engraved to commemorate each show, but almost misses one of his openings herself due to miscarriage and they remain childless.|$|E
2500|$|During an {{interview}} with USA Today, Azalea talked about {{the concept of the}} music video, mentioning Spears's signature dance scenes, [...] "I think Britney's identity is really embedded in being a dancer, and that's something she really wanted to do as well. So there's a lot of dancing in the video, but I wouldn’t say it's necessarily centered around that." [...] When asked about the '80s-inspired visuals seen on the candids from the video shoot, she explained that it would have a narrative and stated that Britney wanted to do a video where she got to dress up and play a character. Azalea revealed she looked to actress Geena Davis when modeling her style, describing her as [...] "the ultimate '80s pin-up hot, cool type of girl" [...] that Britney also liked. Spears added, [...] "I had called my manager and had some ideas about doing a Valley girl-type video. It was really kind of funny, because I had just watched Clueless on TV, and was like, 'It would be so fun to do something like that.' Then I saw Iggy's video, and I thought, 'Oh my God, to work with her would be heaven sent.'" [...] They brainstormed the concept for the video, deciding on a send-up of 1988 sci-fi comedy Earth Girls Are Easy, which starred Davis. Spears said, [...] "I do a makeover for her and we go to a club. The best part about it was just us coming together with the clothes and doing the '80s haircuts. We <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> being characters, so it was kind of funny for us. We weren't taking ourselves so seriously".|$|E

2500|$|More recent {{critical}} reviews {{show the}} album remains highly regarded. Allmusic said [...] "Their rhythms {{may have been}} reggae-based, their music Jamaican-inspired, but UB40 had such an original take on the genre that all comparisons were moot... Their music was... revolutionary, their sound unlike anything else on either island ... It's hard to {{believe this is the}} same UB40 that later topped the U.K. charts with the likes of 'Red Red Wine' and 'I Got You Babe'. Their fire was dampened quickly, but on Signing Off it blazed high, still accessible to the pop market, but so edgy that even those who are sure there's nothing about the group to admire will change their tune instantly." [...] In 2008 Mojo magazine's online website revisited the album as part of their [...] "Disc of the Day" [...] series, calling it [...] "the Brum reggae institution's original and best" [...] and going on to say that [...] "Signing Off was a singular British take on Jamaican music, in some ways truer to the reggae source than 2-Tone but with a punky, multi-cultured sensibility of its own... it's a superb balance of lightness and weight, as spry, skanking tunes rub up against militant lyrics made soulful by vocalist Ali Campbell." [...] The print edition of the magazine also reviewed the 2010 reissue, stating that [...] "Signing Off... has retained much of its fire... this is flinty, political and Britain-focused reggae, distinct from the later output of a band that... still acts as the form's global ambassadors." [...] Reviewing the 2010 Collector's Edition, BBC Music said [...] "Signing Off is still believed {{by many to be the}} group's greatest album, and it remains the clearest window into what the band <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>about...</b> has energy and intelligence that made it stand out from so much post-punk pop. This set sums up a bunch of young Brummies schooled in the West Indian blues dances of Balsall Heath, angry about the world around them and articulate enough to express that without simply ranting." ...|$|E
