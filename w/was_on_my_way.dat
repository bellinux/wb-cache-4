500|$|Welling {{was cast}} in the WB superhero drama Smallville after a {{nationwide}} search for an actor to play Clark Kent. In {{an interview with a}} teen magazine, Welling spoke about the day he auditioned for the role: [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> back from the Warner Bros. studio, and I stopped in a gas station to call my manager and tell him how it went. I called and got him on the phone and he said, 'Can you hold on a second?' Next thing I know, there are literally seven people on the other line and almost in unison they say, 'Tom, you got it!'" [...] The pilot aired in October 2001 and became the highest rated debut for The WB, with 8.4 million viewers. Welling told TV Guide that he turned down the lead role twice, but after reading the script, decided to take the job. Like Christopher Reeve, he was not a Superman fan prior to being cast as Clark Kent. In fact, he said, he continues to not read Superman comics: [...] "I made a conscious decision to stay away from that material. We're doing something different at a time before all that, I don't want that to affect what I'm doing, even subconsciously." [...] He did get the chance to meet two previous Superman actors: Christopher Reeve, who appeared in season 2: episode 17 titled [...] "Rosetta", and Dean Cain, who appeared in season 7: episode 4 titled [...] "Cure".|$|E

She {{also sold}} {{the short story}} Childfinder to Harlan Ellison for the anthology The Last Dangerous Visions. [...] "I thought I <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> as a writer," [...] Butler recalled in her short fiction collection Bloodchild and Other Stories. [...] "In fact, I had five more years of rejection slips and horrible little jobs ahead of me before I sold another word." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 1902, the Giants sent catcher Frank Bowerman {{to persuade}} Taylor {{to return to}} the Giants. [...] Bowerman sat in the stands while Taylor was {{pitching}} and negotiated the terms of Taylor's return to the Giants by signing. Taylor recalled: Frank sat in the grandstand and every time I walked out to the pitching mound he kept talking to me with his fingers. I kept shaking my head [...] "No", and Frank kept boosting the money. Soon, I nodded my head [...] "Yes", and that night I <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> back to New York with Frank.|$|E

2500|$|Abu Ghosh mayor Salim Jaber {{attributed}} the {{good relations with}} Israel to the great importance attached to being hospitable: [...] "We welcome anybody, regardless of religion or race." [...] According to a village elder interviewed by the Toronto Globe and Mail: [...] "Perhaps because {{of the history of}} feuding with the Arabs around us we allied ourselves with the Jews...against the British. We did not join the Arabs from the other villages bombarding Jewish vehicles in 1947. The Palmach fought many villages around us. But there was an order to leave us alone. The other Arabs never thought there would be a Jewish government here...During the first truce of the War of Independence, I <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to Ramallah to see my father and uncles, and I was captured by Jordanian soldiers. They accused me of being a traitor and tortured me for six days." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shore {{was born}} in Toronto, Canada, to Henry and Charlotte Shore. She was the {{youngest}} of seven children. She was drawn to both painting and nature at a young age, remarking [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> home from school and saw myself reflected in a puddle. It was the first time I had seen my image completely surrounded by nature, and I suddenly had an overwhelming sense of belonging to itâ€”of actually being part of every tree and flower. I was filled with a desire to tell what I felt through painting." [...] Shore's mother supported Shore's artistic ambitions, but advised her to learn practical matters as well. After taking a domestic education class, at the age of 15, Shore began studying painting with the Canadian Impressionist Laura Muntz Lyall. Her works at this time are mostly genre scenes and thus conform to subject matter that would have been popular in Toronto's traditional art scene during the period.|$|E
2500|$|... "The Twist" [...] had {{previously}} peaked at #16 on the Billboard {{rhythm and blues}} chart, in the 1959 version recorded by its author, Hank Ballard, whose band The Midnighters first performed the dance on stage. Checker's [...] "Twist", however, was a nationwide smash, aided by his many appearances on Dick Clark's American Bandstand, the Top 10 American Bandstand ranking of the song, and the teenagers on the show who enjoyed dancing the Twist. The song was so ubiquitous that Checker felt that his critics thought that he could only succeed with dance records typecasting him as a dance artist. Checker later lamented:"...in a way, [...] "The Twist" [...] really ruined my life. I <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to becoming a big nightclub performer, and [...] "The Twist" [...] just wiped it out... It got so out of proportion. No one ever believes I have talent." [...] By 1965 alone, [...] "The Twist" [...] had sold over 15 million copies, and was awarded multiple gold discs by the RIAA.|$|E
