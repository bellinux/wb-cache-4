Afterwards: no fatalities, 2 serious and 12 slight accidents). The journalist George Monbiot claimed that the results <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>statistically</b> significant highlighting earlier findings across the whole of Wiltshire {{that there had been a}} 33% reduction in the number of people killed and seriously injured generally and a 68% reduction at camera sites during the previous 3 years.|$|E
500|$|John Arlott later commented that, on {{his first}} tour of England, Constantine [...] "learnt much that he never forgot, by no means all of it about cricket: and he {{recognised}} the game as his only possible ladder {{to the kind of}} life he wanted." [...] When Constantine returned to Trinidad, he had no permanent job and little prospect of advancement in any suitable profession. He took several temporary jobs but was often forced to rely financially upon his family. However, his success had inspired him to pursue a career as a professional cricketer in England, and he began to practise to reach the required standard. Although he scored 167 for Shannon in 1924, and took eight for 38 for Trinidad against Barbados, Constantine's cricket was steady but not consistently successful. He was initially dropped from the West Indies team to face the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) touring team during 1926, though he was recalled for the second match, once again at the insistence of Austin, who wanted a good cover fielder in the team. In the match Constantine was involved in an incident over short-pitched bowling. The MCC fast bowlers had bowled short at the 49-year-old Austin; in retaliation, Constantine bounced the MCC captain, Freddie Calthorpe, and only stopped after James pointed out the diplomatic row which would follow if Calthorpe, a respected figure in the British establishment, was hit by the ball. Once more, Constantine's performances <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>statistically</b> exceptional, but his style impressed critics and spectators, and he came top of the West Indies bowling averages.|$|E
2500|$|According to a Baylor University study [...] "people with no {{religious}} affiliation <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>statistically</b> {{more likely to}} be in intermarriages than evangelical or mainline Protestants or people from other religions" [...] with one exception, Catholics. Catholics were twice as likely to be in an interracial marriage than the general population. It is speculated that {{the reason for this is}} twofold: the increasing diversity of the Catholic population (which has seen a huge influx of immigrants, Catholicism has sizable to significant number of adherents from many nationalities worldwide) and the fact that Catholics typically base their choice of parish on geography rather than on its ethnic or racial makeup which creates more opportunities for interracial mixing. [...] Jews were also more likely to date interracially than Protestants.|$|E

[...] The two most common commercially available tests are the amplified mycobacterium tuberculosis direct test (MTD, Gen-Probe) and Amplicor (Roche Diagnostics).

2500|$|The {{safety of}} red yeast rice {{products}} {{has not been}} established, and some commercial supplements {{have been found to}} contain high levels of the toxin citrinin. As commercial products will have highly variable amounts of monacolins, and rarely declare this content on the label, defining risk is difficult. Ingredient suppliers have also been suspected of [...] "spiking" [...] red yeast rice preparations with purified lovastatin. As evidence, one published analysis reported several commercial products as being almost entirely monacolin K - which would occur if the drug lovastatin was added - rather than the expected composition of many monacolin compounds. Statin drugs are known to cause muscle and liver damage. [...] Statin-associated rhabdomyolysis can lead to kidney damage and possibly kidney failure (renal failure). This is why they are prescription drugs rather than over-the-counter, and with recommendations that the patients' physicians schedule liver function tests on a regular basis. There are many case reports in the literature of muscle myopathy and liver damage resulting from red yeast rice usage. In 2009 Becker et al. reported on a U.S. trial that enrolled 62 patients with known statin-associated myalgias. Half got a RYR product (3600mg/day, 13mg monacolins, 6mg monacolin k) for 24 weeks; and half were administered a placebo. In the treated group, LDL-cholesterol declined 21%. Two patients dropped out because of myalgia, 1 for diarrhea, and 1 for dizziness. In the placebo group, one dropped out for myalgia. Creatine phosphokinase increased slightly in the treated group (from 122 to 128 IU/L) versus decreasing with placebo (117 to 101 IU/L), but the shifts <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>statistically</b> significant. For those having completed the trial, subjective muscle pain scores were similar for the two groups. [...] "The potential safety signals of myopathies and liver injury raise the hypothesis that the safety profile of RYR {{is similar to that of}} statins. Continuous monitoring of dietary supplements should be promoted to finally characterize their risk profile, thus supporting regulatory bodies for appropriate actions." ...|$|E
