5|$|A jonline {{can also}} be used to tether the diver's {{equipment}} to the dive boat before or after the dive.

5|$|After {{considerable}} {{debate and}} various experiments, {{the law was}} changed again in 1972.

Since the 1990s, the availability of television replays and, later, ball-tracking technology to assist umpires has increased the percentage of lbws in major matches. However, the accuracy of the technology and the consequences of its use remain controversial.|$|E

5|$|During {{oxidative}} phosphorylation, electrons {{are transferred}} from electron donors to electron acceptors such as oxygen, in redox reactions. These redox reactions release energy, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> form ATP. In eukaryotes, these redox reactions {{are carried out}} {{by a series of}} protein complexes within the inner membrane of the cell's mitochondria, whereas, in prokaryotes, these proteins are located in the cells' intermembrane space. These linked sets of proteins are called electron transport chains. In eukaryotes, five main protein complexes are involved, whereas in prokaryotes many different enzymes are present, using a variety of electron donors and acceptors.|$|E
5|$|Fungus-growing ants {{that make}} up the tribe Attini, {{including}} leafcutter ants, cultivate certain species of fungus in the Leucoagaricus or Leucocoprinus genera of the Agaricaceae family. In this ant-fungus mutualism, both species depend on each other for survival. The ant Allomerus decemarticulatus has evolved a three-way association with the host plant, Hirtella physophora (Chrysobalanaceae), and a sticky fungus <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> trap their insect prey.|$|E

5|$|In the past, Native Americans ate {{the flesh}} of {{horseshoe}} crabs, and used the tail spines as spear tips and the shells to bail water out of their canoes. More recent attempts to use horseshoe crabs as food for livestock were abandoned when {{it was found that}} this gave the meat a bad taste. Horseshoe crab blood contains a clotting agent, limulus amebocyte lysate, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> test antibiotics and kidney machines to ensure that they are free of dangerous bacteria, and to detect spinal meningitis and some cancers.|$|E
5|$|Judith Ryan, senior {{curator at}} the National Gallery of Victoria, {{described}} Makinti's entry in the 2003 Clemenger Contemporary Art Award as:concerned with touching and sensing with fingers, rather than purely visual. The repetition of colour chords and textured striations, which closely echo each other, has a rhapsodic effect akin to many bodies in dance and reveals the inner or spiritual power, the essence, of Makinti Napanangka's country and cultural identity. The energetic lines invoke body paint for women’s business, and more particularly represent spun hair-string, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> make belts worn by women during ceremonies associated with the rockhole site of Lupulnga, a Peewee Dreaming place.|$|E
5|$|Like all ants, {{they can}} also make use of visual {{landmarks}} when available as well as olfactory and tactile cues to navigate.

5|$|Oxidative {{phosphorylation}} (or OXPHOS in short) is {{the metabolic}} pathway in which cells use enzymes to oxidize nutrients, thereby releasing energy <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In most eukaryotes, this takes place inside mitochondria. Almost all aerobic organisms carry out oxidative phosphorylation. This pathway is probably so pervasive {{because it is}} a highly efficient way of releasing energy, compared to alternative fermentation processes such as anaerobic glycolysis.|$|E
5|$|Pig iron is not pure iron, but has 4–5% carbon {{dissolved}} {{in it with}} small amounts of other impurities like sulfur, magnesium, phosphorus and manganese. As the carbon is the major impurity, the iron (pig iron) becomes brittle and hard. Removing the other impurities results in cast iron, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> cast articles in foundries such as stoves, pipes, radiators, lamp-posts and rails.|$|E
