5|$|Since an {{electron}} behaves as a <b>wave,</b> <b>at</b> a given velocity {{it has a}} characteristic de Broglie wavelength. This is given by λe=h/p where h is the Planck constant and p is the momentum. For the 51GeV electron above, the wavelength is about , small enough to explore structures well below {{the size of an}} atomic nucleus.|$|E

Cope was made an honorary co-captain for the Steelers for a Monday night game against the Baltimore Ravens. Cope led the fans in a towel <b>wave</b> <b>at</b> half time; the Towel that Cope used is now in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|The {{format of}} this wave of pirate radio was {{influenced}} by Radio Luxembourg and American radio stations. Many followed a top 40 format with casual DJs, making UK pirate radio the antithesis of BBC radio at the time. Spurred on by the offshore stations, landbased pirate stations took to the air on medium <b>wave</b> <b>at</b> weekends, such as Radio Free London in 1968.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Andres {{originated}} out of {{a tropical}} wave that entered the eastern Pacific basin on June16 after crossing Central America. Over the following few days, showers and thunderstorms began to organize around the <b>wave.</b> <b>At</b> this time, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) remarked upon the possibility for tropical cyclone formation. By June20, the wave spawned an {{area of low pressure}} roughly 175mi (280km) south-southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. Around 1200UTC the following day, the system had become sufficiently organized for the NHC to designate the low as Tropical Depression Two-E. The depression briefly track westward before turning towards the northwest, a track which it would maintain for the remained of its existence, due to a mid-tropospheric ridge located northeast of the system.|$|E
5|$|Ocean {{surface waves}} are {{propagating}} oscillations {{caused by the}} drag and friction from air moving {{across the surface of}} the water. This friction transfers energy and forms surface waves in the water more or less in the direction of the wind. The top of a wave is known as its crest and its foot as its trough; the distance between two crests is the wavelength. These waves are mechanical: as they approach, the water at a given point rise up and, as they pass, the water goes down, with parcels of water tracing a roughly circular path. The energy is passed along with the <b>wave</b> <b>at</b> a much greater speed than the motion of the water itself.|$|E
5|$|II./NJG1 {{saw little}} {{action in the}} first few months of 1943, and Schnaufer did not claim his next aerial victory until 14 May 1943. II./NJG1 Himmelbett control areas were located to catch the bombers heading for the Ruhr Area. Bomber Command had made only ten major attacks in that region from January to April 1943. Consequently, II./NJG1 claimed no {{victories}} in January, two in February, one in March and three in April. Schnaufer's number of aerial victories increased again during the Battle of the Ruhr. Schnaufer, with Baro as his radio operator, shot down a No. 214 Squadron Short Stirling R9242 at 02:14 on 14 May 1943 on an attack mission against Bochum. Four members of the crew, including pilot Sergeant R. M. Gibney, lost their lives. His next victory on the same mission at 03:07, his 9th overall, was a No. 98 Squadron Halifax JB873 returning from Bochum. The captain, Sergeant G. Dane and 2nd pilot Sergeant J. H. Body were killed in the crash. On the night of 29/30 May, Bomber Command attacked Wuppertal. Schnaufer and Baro took off on the first <b>wave</b> <b>at</b> 23:51 on 29 May and returned at 02:31 on the 30 May. They shot down two Stirlings, one at 00:48 and the other at 02:22, and one Halifax at 01:43.|$|E

25|$|Polarization is best {{understood}} by initially considering only pure polarization states, {{and only a}} coherent sinusoidal <b>wave</b> <b>at</b> some optical frequency. The vector in the adjacent diagram might describe the oscillation of the electric field emitted by a single-mode laser (whose oscillation frequency would be typically 1015 times faster). The field oscillates in the x-y plane, along the page, with the wave propagating in the z direction, perpendicular to the page.|$|E
25|$|The phase {{velocity}} of an electromagnetic wave, when traveling through a medium, can routinely exceed c, the vacuum velocity of light. For example, this occurs in most glasses at X-ray frequencies. However, the {{phase velocity}} {{of a wave}} corresponds to the propagation speed of a theoretical single-frequency (purely monochromatic) component of the <b>wave</b> <b>at</b> that frequency. Such a wave component must be infinite in extent and of constant amplitude (otherwise it is not truly monochromatic), and so cannot convey any information.|$|E
25|$|During the {{segmentation}} of vertebrate embryos, {{waves of}} gene expression sweep across the presomitic mesoderm, the tissue {{from which the}} precursors of the vertebrae (somites) are formed. A new somite is formed upon arrival of a <b>wave</b> <b>at</b> the anterior end of the presomitic mesoderm. In zebrafish, {{it has been shown}} that the shortening of the presomitic mesoderm during segmentation leads to a Doppler effect as the anterior end of the tissue moves into the waves. This Doppler effect contributes to the period of segmentation.|$|E

25|$|Wave–particle duality {{is deeply}} {{embedded}} into {{the foundations of}} quantum mechanics. In the formalism of the theory, all the information about a particle is encoded in its wave function, a complex-valued function roughly analogous to the amplitude of a <b>wave</b> <b>at</b> each point in space. This function evolves according to a differential equation (generically called the Schrödinger equation). For particles with mass this equation has solutions that follow {{the form of the}} wave equation. Propagation of such waves leads to wave-like phenomena such as interference and diffraction. Particles without mass, like photons, have no solutions of the Schrödinger equation so have another wave.|$|E
25|$|Standup surfing {{begins when}} the surfer paddles toward shore {{in an attempt}} to match the speed of the wave (The same applies whether the surfer is standup paddling, bodysurfing, boogie-boarding or using some other type of watercraft, such as a waveski or kayak.). Once the wave begins to carry the surfer forward, the surfer stands up and {{proceeds}} to ride the wave. The basic idea is to position the surfboard so it is just ahead of the breaking part (whitewash) of the wave. A common problem for beginners is being able to catch the <b>wave</b> <b>at</b> all.|$|E
25|$|Google Wave {{was a new}} Internet {{communications}} platform. It {{was written}} in Java using OpenJDK and its web interface used the Google Web Toolkit. Google Wave works like previous messaging systems such as email and Usenet, but instead of sending a message along with its entire thread of previous messages, or requiring all responses to be stored in each user's inbox for context, message documents (referred to as waves) that contain complete threads of multimedia messages (blips) are perpetually stored on a central server. Waves are shared with collaborators who can be added or removed from the <b>wave</b> <b>at</b> any point during a wave's existence.|$|E

Poplawski then shot Kelly as he was attempting to aid Sciullo and Mayhle. Officer Timothy McManaway arrived at the scene and was shot in the hand while attempting to pull Kelly to safety, after he saw Kelly <b>wave</b> <b>at</b> him. McManaway sought cover and returned fire. Another officer, Brian Jones, suffered a broken leg when a fence he was climbing collapsed. A short time later, more officers, SWAT team members, and other law enforcement officers arrived and were fired on as well.|$|E
25|$|Shielding {{effectiveness}} {{depends on}} the frequency being used. Low-frequency LowFID tags, like those used in implantable devices for humans and pets, are relatively resistant to shielding though thick metal foil will prevent most reads. High frequency HighFID tags (13.56MHz—smart cards and access badges) are sensitive to shielding and are difficult to read when within a few centimetres of a metal surface. UHF Ultra-HighFID tags (pallets and cartons) are difficult to read when placed within a few millimetres of a metal surface, although their read range is actually increased when they are spaced 2–4cm from a metal surface due to positive reinforcement of the reflected wave and the incident <b>wave</b> <b>at</b> the tag.|$|E
25|$|Neanderthals, Denisovans, {{and modern}} humans are all {{considered}} to have descended from Homo heidelbergensis that appeared around 700,000 years ago in Africa. Fossils have been recovered in Ethiopia, Namibia and South Africa. Between 400,000 and 300,000 years ago a group of Homo heidelbergensis migrated into Europe and West Asia via yet unknown routes and eventually evolved into Neanderthals. Archaeological sites exist in Spain, Italy, France, England, Germany, Hungary and Greece. Another Homo heidelbergensis group ventured eastwards into continental Asia and evolved into Denisovans. The Homo heidelbergensis (Homo rhodesiensis) population that remained in Africa evolved into anatomically modern humans between 300,000 to 200,000 years ago, then migrated into Europe and Asia in a second <b>wave</b> <b>at</b> some point between 125,000 and 60,000 years ago.|$|E
