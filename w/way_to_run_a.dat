2500|$|In a video titled [...] "Catholic Government", now {{removed from}} his apostolate's site but still {{available}} online, Voris reiterates the statement by St. Thomas Aquinas that monarchy is the highest form of government ("Accordingly, the best form of government {{is in a state}} or kingdom, wherein one is given the power to preside over all." [...] Summa Theologica I-11, 105.1). In the video Voris said, [...] "The only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>a</b> country is by benevolent dictatorship, a Catholic monarch who protects his people from themselves and bestows on them what they need, not necessarily what they want." [...] Voris later clarified his remarks, saying it would have been more accurate if he had called it an [...] "enlightened monarchy," [...] but maintaining that his larger point [...] "that a society needs strong morals in order to survive" [...] remains true. Voris holds {{that there has been a}} liberal shift in the Catholic Church, a post-1960s culture that has had a negative influence over Catholics; some of this has been influenced by [...] "Americanism," [...] a heresy that Pope Leo XIII warned about in the 19th century. The Detroit Free Press reported that Voris holds that [...] "Many current church leaders are 'namby-pamby... It's all about, [...] "Love your neighbor."' What's needed instead, he said, is [...] "a muscular Catholicism that isn't afraid to encourage battle and sacrifice." ...|$|E

40|$|Lean, Lean Manufacturing, Lean Principles. What is {{all this}} {{discussion}} of Lean? And {{what does it mean}} to the printer? First, let’s figure out what Lean is. Lean is a set of ideas, concepts, tools, and principles that were developed over a number of years, mostly by Toyota Motor Corp. as the Toyota Production System (TPS). The company developed this system as a means to be competitive in a difficult marketplace against large competitors with greater resources. The values that underpin Lean include: respect for people, continuous improvement, minimizing waste, just-in-time (JIT) production, custom and small-lot production, problem solving, teamwork, focusing on customer value, and employee development. With that background, you may ask what value Lean has for printers. Nearly all Lean principles focus on <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> better <b>run</b> <b>a</b> business and particularly <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> better <b>run</b> <b>a</b> manufacturing business in a competitive landscape. So Lean has numerous applications for printers. Lean is simple in concept but complex to implement and sustain. It took Toyota several decades to refine their ideas...|$|R
40|$|Bureaucracy as an {{organizational}} form {{has always been}} a controversial issue and placed {{at the very heart of}} most discussions within organizational theory. One side of this prolonged discussion praises this administrative form as the ‘rational’ <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>an</b> organization. It provides needed guidance and clarifies responsibilities, which enables employees to become more efficient. However, the opposition claims that in a non-linear world, where industrial organizations are forced to confront the challenging task of sensing and responding to unpredictable, novel situations of highly competitive markets, such {{an organizational}} form stifles creativity, fosters de-motivation and causes pressure on employees. Dealing with a bureaucratic form of organization and its consequences begs for a context. It would be appropriate to quit ‘taking sides’ and develop a sound analysis of this phenomenon under the conditions of today’s global workplace environment. This chapter intends to delineate the conditions under which bureaucracy has emerged and the way it has been interpreted since its inception and develop a sound and appropriate analytical approach to its functioning given the prevailing conditions of the contemporary workplace.

40|$|In {{the mid to}} late 1980 s, the U. S. economy {{simultaneously}} producedÑfor {{the first}} time in the postwar periodÑhuge federal budget deficits as well as large current account deficits, together known as the Òtwin deficitsÓ (Blecker 1992; Rock 1991). This generated much debate and hand-wringing, most of which focused on supposed Òcrowding-outÓ effects (Wray 1989). Many claimed that the budgetdeficit was soaking up private saving, leaving too little for domestic investment, and that the ÒtwinÓ current account deficit was soaking up foreign saving. The result would be higher interest rates and thus lower economic growth, as domestic spendingÑespecially on business investment and real estate construction was depressed. Further, the government debt and foreign debt would burden future generations of Americans, who would have to make interest payments and eventually retire the debt. The promulgated solution was to promote domestic saving by cutting federal government spending and private consumption (Rock 1991; Council of Economic Advisers 2006). Many pointed to JapanÕs high personal saving rates as a model of the proper <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>an</b> economy. ...|$|R

40|$|When agents with {{independent}} priors {{bid for a}} single item, Myerson’s optimal auction maximizes expected revenue, whereas Vickrey’s second-price auction optimizes social welfare. We address the natural question of trade-offs, auctions that optimize revenue without losing too much welfare, say. If one allows for randomized mechanisms, {{it is easy to}} see that there are polynomial-time mechanisms that achieve any point in the trade-off (the Pareto curve) between revenue and welfare. We ask the question of whether one can achieve the same guarantees using deterministic mechanisms. We provide a negative answer to this question by showing that this is a weakly NP-hard problem. On the positive side, we provide polynomial-time deterministic mechanisms that approximate with arbitrary precision any point of the trade-off between these two fundamental objectives for the case of two bidders, even when the valuations are correlated arbitrarily. The major problem left open by our work is whether there is such Two are the fundamental results in the theory of auctions. First, Vickrey observed that there is <b>a</b> simple <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>an</b> auction so that social welfare (efficiency) is maximized: The second-price (Vickrey) auction is optimally efficient, independently of how bidder valuations are distributed.

Otherwise, on a metric track, there will be a relay zone 10 meters before the common start/finish line, frequently marked by a triangle pointed toward the finish.
