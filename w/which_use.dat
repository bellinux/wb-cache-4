5|$|Aerophones, {{which produce}} a sound with a {{vibrating}} column of air; they {{are sorted into}} free aerophones such as a bullroarer or whip, which move freely through the air; flutes, which cause the air to pass over a sharp edge; reed instruments, <b>which</b> <b>use</b> a vibrating reed; and lip-vibrated aerophones such as trumpets, for which the lips themselves function as vibrating reeds.|$|E
5|$|Basic SQL {{comparison}} operators always return Unknown {{when comparing}} anything with Null, so the SQL standard provides for two special Null-specific comparison predicates. The IS NULL and IS NOT NULL predicates (<b>which</b> <b>use</b> a postfix syntax) test whether data is, or is not, Null.|$|E

5|$|Crustaceans {{exhibit a}} number of larval forms, of which the {{earliest}} and most characteristic is the nauplius. This has three pairs of appendages, all emerging from the young animal's head, and a single naupliar eye. In most groups, there are further larval stages, including the zoea (pl. zoeæ or zoeas). This name was given to it when naturalists believed {{it to be a}} separate species. It follows the nauplius stage and precedes the post-larva. Zoea larvae swim with their thoracic appendages, as opposed to nauplii, <b>which</b> <b>use</b> cephalic appendages, and megalopa, <b>which</b> <b>use</b> abdominal appendages for swimming. It often has spikes on its carapace, which may assist these small organisms in maintaining directional swimming. In many decapods, due to their accelerated development, the zoea is the first larval stage. In some cases, the zoea stage is followed by the mysis stage, and in others, by the megalopa stage, depending on the crustacean group involved.|$|E
5|$|Exits are {{numbered}} sequentially (unlike other interstates in Maryland <b>which</b> <b>use</b> a milepost-based system), {{and in a}} clockwise (inner loop) direction, in accordance with AASHTO guidelines.|$|E
5|$|Most {{stations}} on the Bloor–Danforth line have side platforms; however, {{there are}} still a few stations <b>which</b> <b>use</b> a centre platform instead. At the surface, some stations are designed {{to be a part of}} the shopping area which are located above the subway. Other stations are large facilities on the surface which also contain bus and/or streetcar platforms to allow transfers to take place.|$|E
50|$|Comitative {{relations}} are also commonly expressed by using adpositions: prepositions, postpositions and circumpositions. Examples of languages that use adpositional constructions to express comitative {{relations are}} French, <b>which</b> <b>uses</b> prepositions; Wayãpi, <b>which</b> <b>uses</b> postpositions; and Bambara, <b>which</b> <b>uses</b> circumpositions.|$|R
50|$|Many {{researchers}} and demographers continue to <b>use</b> dates <b>which</b> {{correspond to the}} strict fertility patterns in the population, which results in a Generation X starting date of 1965, such as Pew Research Center <b>which</b> <b>uses</b> a range of 1965-1980, MetLife <b>which</b> <b>uses</b> 1965-1976, Australia's McCrindle Research Center <b>which</b> <b>uses</b> 1965-1979, and Gallup <b>which</b> also <b>uses</b> 1965-1979.|$|R
50|$|A {{minority}} of demographers and researchers start the generation in the mid-to-late 1970s, such as Synchrony Financial which describes Millennials as starting {{as early as}} 1976, Mobilize.org <b>which</b> <b>uses</b> 1976-1996, MetLife <b>which</b> <b>uses</b> birth dates ranging from 1977-1994, and Nielsen Media Research <b>which</b> <b>uses</b> 1977-1995.|$|R
5|$|Other NAD-dependent enzymes include {{bacterial}} DNA ligases, which join two DNA ends {{by using}} NAD {{as a substrate}} to donate an adenosine monophosphate (AMP) moiety to the 5' phosphate of one DNA end. This intermediate is then attacked by the 3' hydroxyl group of the other DNA end, forming a new phosphodiester bond. This contrasts with eukaryotic DNA ligases, <b>which</b> <b>use</b> ATP to form the DNA-AMP intermediate.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle toe}} of the California condor's foot is greatly elongated, and the hind one is only {{slightly}} developed. The talons of all the toes are straight and blunt, and are thus more adapted to walking than gripping. This is more similar to their supposed relatives the storks than to birds of prey and Old World vultures, <b>which</b> <b>use</b> their feet as weapons or organs of prehension.|$|E
5|$|The {{mountain}} {{is a popular}} destination, attracting an estimated 100,000 ascents a year, around three-quarters of <b>which</b> <b>use</b> the Pony Track from Glen Nevis.|$|E

5|$|The same {{material}} also functions in newer alkaline batteries (usually battery cells), <b>which</b> <b>use</b> {{the same basic}} reaction, but a different electrolyte mixture. In 2002, more than 230,000tons of manganese dioxide was used for this purpose.|$|E
5|$|A {{plate of}} hard horny tissue {{at the tip}} of the beak of all birds in the family Anatidae (ducks, geese and swans). This shield-shaped structure, which {{sometimes}} spans the entire width of the beak, is often bent at the tip to form a hook. It serves different purposes depending on the bird's primary food source. Most species use their nails to dig seeds out of mud or vegetation, while diving ducks use theirs to pry molluscs from rocks. There is evidence that the nail may help a bird to grasp things; species <b>which</b> <b>use</b> strong grasping motions to secure their food (such as when catching and holding onto a large squirming frog) have very wide nails. Certain types of mechanoreceptors, nerve cells that are sensitive to pressure, vibration or touch, are located under the nail.|$|E
5|$|An atom can be ionized by {{removing}} {{one of its}} electrons. The electric charge causes the trajectory of an atom to bend when it passes through a magnetic field. The radius by which the trajectory of a moving ion is turned by the magnetic field {{is determined by the}} mass of the atom. The mass spectrometer uses this principle to measure the mass-to-charge ratio of ions. If a sample contains multiple isotopes, the mass spectrometer can determine the proportion of each isotope in the sample by measuring the intensity of the different beams of ions. Techniques to vaporize atoms include inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, both of <b>which</b> <b>use</b> a plasma to vaporize samples for analysis.|$|E

25|$|Each {{overseas}} territory has been granted its own flag and {{coat of arms}} by the British monarch. Traditionally, the flags follow the Blue Ensign design, with the Union Flag in the canton, and the territory's coat of arms in the fly. Exceptions to this are Bermuda <b>which</b> <b>uses</b> a Red Ensign; British Antarctic Territory <b>which</b> <b>uses</b> a White Ensign; British Indian Ocean Territory <b>which</b> <b>uses</b> a Blue Ensign with wavy lines to symbolise the sea; and Gibraltar <b>which</b> <b>uses</b> a banner of its coat of arms (the flag {{of the city of}} Gibraltar).|$|R
5|$|Compact Linear Fresnel Reflectors are CSP-plants <b>which</b> <b>use</b> many thin mirror strips {{instead of}} {{parabolic}} mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto two tubes with working fluid. This {{has the advantage}} that flat mirrors can be used which are much cheaper than parabolic mirrors, and that more reflectors can {{be placed in the}} same amount of space, allowing more of the available sunlight to be used. Concentrating linear fresnel reflectors can be used in either large or more compact plants.|$|E
5|$|From 1988 onwards {{analyses}} {{based on}} molecular phylogeny, which compares biochemical {{features such as}} similarities in DNA, have placed brachiopods among the Lophotrochozoa, a protostome super-phylum that includes molluscs, annelids and flatworms but excludes the other protostome super-phylum Ecdysozoa, whose members include arthropods. This conclusion is unanimous among molecular phylogeny studies, <b>which</b> <b>use</b> {{a wide selection of}} genes: rDNA, Hox genes, mitochondrial protein genes, single nuclear protein genes and sets of nuclear protein genes.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, the BBC and {{commercial}} radio operators launched RadioPlayer which allows over 400 radio stations to be listened to through its website and apps. In addition various {{radio stations and}} third parties allow streaming of internet radio stations through their own websites and apps. A number of British firms, including BT Group, Reciva, Pure Digital, Roberts Radio and Acoustic Energy have brought out Internet radio devices <b>which</b> <b>use</b> the Wi-Fi signal from a router to stream Internet radio stations within range of a Wi-Fi router.|$|E

50|$|V-twin engines, {{adapted from}} motorcycles, were {{featured}} in Morgan three-wheelers made from 1911 to 1939. Morgan {{introduced a new}} Morgan 3-Wheeler in 2011. A number of Morgan-inspired models are produced today including the Triking Cyclecar, <b>which</b> <b>uses</b> a Moto-Guzzi V-twin; the Ace Cycle Car, <b>which</b> <b>uses</b> a V-twin Harley-Davidson engine; and the JZR <b>which</b> <b>uses</b> engines from the Honda CX series.|$|R
5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Honda {{introduced}} their newer NF series motorcycles, known as Honda Wave series, called the Honda Innova in some markets, <b>which</b> <b>use</b> steel tube frames, front disc brake and plastic cover sets in various displacement options: 100cc, 110cc and 125cc. Though not Cubs, these bikes sold consistently well particularly in European countries, where {{the production of}} Honda Cub models had been previously discontinued. However, the production of Honda Cubs in Asia, Africa and South America still continues today, even though the newer Honda Wave Series and other designs have been introduced alongside the Cub.|$|E
5|$|Kinstones {{are special}} {{artifacts}} which Link can find throughout his quest. Kinstone pieces are fragments of a medallion {{that are found}} {{throughout the course of}} the game. If the player can find a character or object with a Kinstone piece (indicated by a thought bubble above their heads), the player can try to fuse their Kinstone piece with one of their own to make a match. If a successful fusion is made, something will occur somewhere within the game's world, including the placement of treasure chests, access to secret areas and certain events which occur among certain characters. Whilst many Kinstone fusions are optional, some fusions, such as those <b>which</b> <b>use</b> Golden Kinstones, are necessary to advance the story.|$|E
5|$|Kulintang {{belongs to}} the larger unit/stratum of “knobbed gong-chime culture” {{prevalent}} in Southeast Asia. It {{is considered one of}} the region’s three major gong ensembles, alongside the gamelan of western Indonesia and piphat of Thailand, Burma, Cambodia and Laos, <b>which</b> <b>use</b> gongs and not wind or string instruments to carry the melodic part of the ensemble. Like the other two, kulintang music is primarily orchestral with several rhythmic parts orderly stacked one upon another. It is also based upon the pentatonic scale. However, kulintang music differs in many aspects from gamelan music, primarily in the way the latter constructs melodies within a framework of skeletal tones and prescribed time interval of entry for each instruments. The framework of kulintang music is more flexible and time intervals are nonexistent, allowing for such things as improvisations to be more prevalent.|$|E
