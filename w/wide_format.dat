2500|$|Most militia group portraits were {{commissioned}} in Haarlem and Amsterdam, and {{were much more}} flamboyant and relaxed or even boisterous than other types of portraits, as well as much larger. [...] Early examples showed them dining, but later groups showed most figures standing for a more dynamic composition. [...] Rembrandt's famous The Militia Company of Captain Frans Banning Cocq {{better known as the}} Night Watch (1642), was an ambitious and not entirely successful attempt to show a group in action, setting out for a patrol or parade, also innovative in avoiding the typical very <b>wide</b> <b>format</b> of such works.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Wide</b> <b>format</b> {{printers}} (large format printers) {{are generally}} accepted {{to be any}} computer-controlled printing machines (printers) that support a maximum print roll width of between 18" [...] and 100". Printers with capacities over 100" [...] wide are considered super wide or grand format. <b>Wide</b> <b>format</b> printers are used to print banners, posters, trade show graphics, wallpaper, murals, backlit film (duratrans), vehicle image wraps, electronic circuit schematics, architectural drawings, construction plans, backdrops for theatrical and media sets, and any other large format artwork or signage. <b>Wide</b> <b>format</b> printers usually employ some variant of inkjet technology to produce the printed image; and are more economical than other print methods such as screen printing for most short-run (low quantity) print projects, depending on print size, run length (quantity of prints per single original), {{and the type of}} substrate or print medium. <b>Wide</b> <b>format</b> printers are usually designed for printing onto a roll of print media that feeds incrementally during the print process, rather than onto individual sheets.|$|E

50|$|In {{the example}} above, two data sets with a panel {{structure}} are shown. Individual characteristics (income, age, sex) are collected for different persons and different years. In the left data set two persons (1, 2) are observed {{over three years}} (2001, 2002, 2003). Because each person is observed every year, the left-hand data set is called a balanced panel, whereas the data set on the right hand is called an unbalanced panel, since person 1 is not observed in year 2003 and person 3 is not observed in 2003 or 2001. This specific structure these data sets are in is called long format where one row holds one observation per time. Another way to structure panel data would be the <b>wide</b> <b>format</b> where one row represents one observational unit for all points in time (for the example, the <b>wide</b> <b>format</b> would have only two (left example) or three (right example) rows of data with additional columns for each time-varying variable (income, age). Representing panel data in long format is much more common than using the <b>wide</b> <b>format</b> because it saves storage space. This {{is due to the}} fact that <b>wide</b> <b>format</b> will have lots of sparse cells wasting storage space.|$|E

It is made with the same polyester-base film as is used for Duratrans, but is available in a <b>wider</b> <b>format.</b> Two significant improvements are that it allows the application of additional diffusion in the printing process, solving the see-through problem of Duratrans, and does not require matte coating with lacquer, as is needed with Duratrans. It is also more scratch-resistant than its predecessor.|$|R
50|$|Several {{microprocessor}} families offer limited decimal support. For example, the 80x86 {{family of}} microprocessors provide instructions to convert one-byte BCD numbers (packed and unpacked) to binary format {{before or after}} arithmetic operations. These operations were not extended to <b>wider</b> <b>formats</b> and hence are now slower than using 32-bit or wider BCD 'tricks' to compute in BCD (see http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/~jones/bcd/bcd.html). The x87 FPU has instructions to convert 10-byte (18 decimal digits) packed decimal data, although it then operates on them as floating-point numbers.|$|R
