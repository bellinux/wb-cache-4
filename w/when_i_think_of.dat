Nor <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> others whom I knew {{as a young man}} at both Universities, can I remember any instance of injury being done to the health which could fairly be set down to the exercise of rowing as then practised. It is true we used to be told, even in those days, that no man in a Racing-Boat could expect to live to the age of thirty.|$|E

During his illness in 1928, one of his doctors, Sir Farquhar Buzzard, was asked who had saved the King's life. He replied, [...] "The Queen". In 1935, King George V and Queen Mary celebrated their silver jubilee, with celebrations taking place throughout the British Empire.

500|$|Notwithstanding Eisenhower's {{estimation}} of Patton's abilities {{as a strategic}} planner, his overall view of Patton's military value in achieving Allied victory in Europe can best be seen in Eisenhower's refusal to even consider sending Patton home after the slapping incidents of 1943, after which he privately remarked, [...] "Patton is indispensable to the war effort– one of the guarantors of our victory." [...] As Assistant Secretary of War John J. McCloy told Eisenhower: [...] "Lincoln's remark after they got after Grant comes to mind <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> Patton– 'I can't spare this man, he fights'." [...] After Patton's death, Eisenhower would write his own tribute: [...] "He {{was one of those}} men born to be a soldier, an ideal combat leader... It is no exaggeration to say that Patton's name struck terror at the hearts of the enemy." ...|$|E
500|$|Feroz Khan's Janbaaz (1986) {{told the}} story of a man {{fighting}} the drug menace. The film became known for its steamy love scene involving Kapadia and male lead Anil Kapoor, in which the two also shared a full on kiss, something Hindi movie-goers were not accustomed to in those days. In that same year she acted opposite Saagar co-star Kamal Haasan in her first regional film, Vikram, a Tamil-language sci-fi feature. She played the minor part of Inimaasi, a young princess who falls for the title character, played by Haasan. At that time, she also worked in numerous Hindi films made by producers from the South, including Pataal Bhairavi, which she detested. She has confessed to accepting these roles for financial gain rather than artistic merit during this period, noting, [...] "I shudder even now <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> those films.

500|$|Kidd {{appeared}} in supporting roles {{as a character}} actor in the 1970s and 1980s, beginning with his performance as the faded, cynical choreographer for a cheesy beauty pageant in the satirical 1975 film Smile, which starred Bruce Dern. Film critic Roger Ebert called Kidd's portrayal of the pageant choreographer a [...] "finely etched semiautobiographical performance". He acted in and staged the musical sequences in the 1978 film Movie Movie, which was directed by [...] Stanley Donen, with whom he'd worked in Seven Brides for Seven Brothers and It's Always Fair Weather. Kidd directed an episode of the TV comedy Laverne and Shirley (1990), as well as scenes for Janet Jackson in two music videos, <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>Think</b> <b>of</b> You (1986) and Alright (1990).

500|$|Soon {{after writing}} these letters, Prince Albert died on 14 December 1861. His death helped Ernest repair his {{relationship}} with his sister-in-law, as Victoria had been becoming increasingly angrier over Ernest's objections to the Danish match. The two brothers had always been close, whatever their disagreements, and Albert's death left Ernest [...] "wretched", noted Victoria in a letter to her eldest daughter. The death did not solve their argument however; seeing that his direct involvement had failed to persuade Victoria, Ernest tried a new tactic. He began to spread gossip about Alexandra and her family, in which her mother Princess Louise [...] "had had illegitimate children and Alexandra had had flirtations with young officers"; he also wrote to Louise herself, warning that Bertie would be an unfortunate choice for a husband. Additionally, Ernest met with his nephew at Thebes, most likely attempting to discourage him from the match in person. In an 11 April letter, Victoria unhappily noted to her eldest daughter [...] "You did not tell me that Bertie had met Uncle Ernest at Thebes...I am always alarmed <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> Uncle Ernest and Bertie being together as I know the former will do all he can to set Bertie against the marriage with Princess Alix".

When Burke heard this he was so much hurt in his turn, that he went to Lord Fitzwilliam and the whole thing was made up". However Burke still felt unable to receive money from Fitzwilliam, declining it on 29 November. Fox wrote to William Adam on 15 December that Fitzwilliam's [...] "unremitting kindness to me in all situations quite oppresses me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it.

2500|$|Many of {{the songs}} were {{composed}} over several years, both {{in the studio and}} on the road. Parker saved ideas using a voice recorder on his phone, and wrote many songs on a drum machine. Guitars are present in every song on Currents, but are used to accompany and answer other instruments. This was partially due to his gear being inaccessible: [...] "We'd finish one tour in say, Europe, go home for two weeks, and all our gear, including my guitars and pedals, would be on their way to South America." [...] He had a larger array of synthesizers at his home studio, which allowed them to become the prominent instrument. He said, [...] "It's really just whatever is sitting around <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the song." [...] The album incorporates Parker's falsetto, as well as a vocoder.|$|E
5000|$|Originally the band's drummer, Strickland {{switched}} to guitar {{after the death}} of guitarist Ricky Wilson in 1985. Strickland also plays keyboards and bass guitar on many of The B-52s recordings, and has occasionally provided backing vocals. Strickland composes the music for The B-52s. He said of the process: [...] "Ricky and I used to write the music together, but now I write the individual instrument parts and arrange the instrumental compositions myself. I'm trying to convey a feeling <b>when</b> <b>I</b> compose. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> my instrumentals as soundscapes - the chord progressions, rhythms, harmonics and musical direction are used to evoke various sonic atmospheres or moods." ...|$|R

2500|$|Shostakovich's {{plan was}} for a single-movement symphony, {{including}} a chorus and a requiem-like passage for a vocal soloist, with a text taken from the Psalms of David. With {{the help of his}} best friend, critic Ivan Sollertinsky, who was knowledgeable about the Bible, he selected excerpts from the Ninth Psalm. The idea of individual suffering became interwoven in Shostakovich's mind with the Lord God's vengeance for the taking of innocent blood (Verse 12, New King James Version). The theme not only conveyed his outrage over Stalin's oppression, but also may have inspired him to write the Seventh Symphony in the first place. [...] "I began writing it having been deeply moved by the Psalms of David; the symphony deals with more than that, but the Psalms were the impetus," [...] the composer said. [...] "David has some marvelous words on blood, that God takes revenge for blood, He doesn't forget the cries of victims, and so on. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the Psalms, I become agitated." ...|$|E

Uncle Peter Gansevoort, who was one of the directors of the New York State Bank, got Herman a job as clerk for $150 a year. What he thought of all the drama in his young life is a question biographers answer by citing Redburn: [...] "I had learned to think much and bitterly before my time," [...] the narrator remarks, adding, [...] "I must not think of those delightful days, before my father became a bankrupt... and we removed from the city; for <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> those days, something rises up in my throat and almost strangles me."

On October 3, 2013, he released another second trailer for the mixtape, also revealing 1,000 hard copies of the mixtape would be sold for $100 each. He explained his decision to RapRadar saying, [...] "It’s 2013. Whether we accept it or not, buying music is a choice, not a requisite. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the psychology behind what makes me purchase an artists album, it’s always a form of reciprocation. Almost like a token of appreciation after I experience the product. The reason I chose to charge $100 dollars each copy and only start with 1000 units is because I tailor making my music {{for those who are}} listening. it's not about stepping outside of what I’m known for in hopes of new discovery. What that means less is fans that are better served. I'm more or less focused on fully serving the ones that have connected all ready.
