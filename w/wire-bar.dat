40|$|Organic {{thin films}} based on {{composite}} materials of semiconducting dibenzo-tetrathiafulvalene (DB-TTF) and insulating styrenic matrices (Polystyrene (PS 10 k) and Poly-alpha methylstyrene (PAMS 10 k)) have been fabricated by the <b>wire-bar</b> coating technique in ambient conditions (air, light, humidity) and {{contrasted with the}} ones prepared by thermally evaporating the organic semiconductor. The transistors fabricated with DB-TTF:PS 10 k composites show a clear fieldeffect behavior with p-type characteristics, exhibiting charge carriers mobilities {{in the range of}} 0. 01 cm 2 /Vs, fully comparable with the films obtained by thermal evaporation. However, while the thermally evaporated films show poor stability in air, the <b>wire-bar</b> coated composites films and devices are highly reproducible and exhibit lower threshold voltage values. Thus, we demonstrate the suitability of the <b>wire-bar</b> technique for manufacturing large area devices.

40|$|The Animal Welfare Regulations, which define legal {{requirements}} for the care and use of gerbils in research and testing, and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals describe feeding practices for several species of rodents but not Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus). To investigate whether the method of feed presentation affected reproduction and growth of gerbils, we compared the reproductive performance and {{rate of growth of}} gerbils fed on the cage floor, by hopper (J-feeder), or by <b>wire-bar</b> cage lid. Reproductive parameters of 10 breeding pairs for each method of feeding were followed for 63 d and did not differ between methods. To investigate the effect of feeding method on weight gain in juvenile gerbils, groups of 80 male and 80 female weanling gerbils per feeding method were fed for 5 consecutive weeks after weaning and weighed weekly. Gerbils fed on the cage floor and by means of J-feeders were significantly heavier than were those fed by using a <b>wire-bar</b> top. Our findings indicate that feeding gerbils by using J-feeders or on the cage floor are both acceptable practices...|$|E
40|$|This lecture {{gives an}} {{overview}} {{about the possibilities}} to produce aluminium foilstock and <b>wire-bar</b> in a continuous way. Continuous casting is the preferred casting method in modern plants because it offers higher productivity. But there are limitations {{in the use of}} this technology because not all alloys can be cast. The product shows properties that can differ from conventional material. This lecture demonstrates the principal of operation; technologies for continuous casting; types of casters; areas of application; properties of the products; behaviour of the products in further processing. General knowledge in materials engineering, some knowledge about aluminium alloy constitution and heat treatment, engineering background in manufacturing processes and basic knowledge of foundry practice is assumed. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{processing}} of solution-based binary blends of the ferroelectric random copolymer poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) P(VDF-TrFE) and the semiconducting polymer poly(9, 9 -dioctylfluorenyl- 2, 7 -diyl) (PFO) applied by spin-coating and <b>wire-bar</b> coating is investigated. By systematic variation of blend composition, solvent, and deposition temperature it is shown that much smoother blend films {{can be obtained}} than reported thus far. At a low PFO:P(VDF-TrFE) ratio the blend film consists of disk-shaped PFO domains embedded in a P(VDF-TrFE) matrix, while an inverted structure is obtained in case the P(VDF-TrFE) is the minority component. The microstructure of the phase separated blend films is self-affine. From this observation and from the domain size distribution it is concluded that the phase separation occurs via spinodal decomposition, irrespectively of blend ratio. This is explained by the strong incompatibility of the two polymers expressed by the binary phase diagram, as constructed from thermal analysis data. Time resolved numerical simulation of the microstructure evolution during de-mixing qualitatively shows how an elevated deposition temperature has a smoothening effect {{as a result of}} the reduction of the repulsion between the blend components. The small roughness allowed the realization of bistable rectifying diodes that switch at low voltages with a yield of 100 %. This indicates that memory characteristics can be tailored from the outset while processing parameters can be adjusted according to the phase behavior of the active components. ...|$|E
40|$|Photovoltaics {{provide a}} {{feasible}} route to fulfilling the {{substantial increase in}} demand for energy worldwide. Solution processable organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have attracted attention {{in the last decade}} because of the promise of low-cost manufacturing of sufficiently efficient devices at high throughput on large-area rigid or flexible substrates with potentially low energy and carbon footprints. In OPVs, the photoactive layer is made of a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) layer and is typically composed of a blend of an electron-donating (D) and an electron-accepting (A) materials which phase separate at the nanoscale and form a heterojunction at the D-A interface that plays {{a crucial role in the}} generation of charges. Despite the tremendous progress that has been made in increasing the efficiency of organic photovoltaics over the last few years, with power conversion efficiency increasing from 8 % to 13 % over the duration of this PhD dissertation, there have been numerous debates on the mechanisms of formation of the crucial BHJ layer and few clues about how to successfully transfer these lessons to scalable processes. This stems in large part from a lack of understanding of how BHJ layers form from solution. This lack of understanding makes it challenging to design BHJs and to control their formation in laboratory-based processes, such as spin-coating, let alone their successful transfer to scalable processes required for the manufacturing of organic solar cells. Consequently, the OPV community has in recent years sought out to better understand the key characteristics of state of the art lab-based organic solar cells and made efforts to shed light on how the BHJ forms in laboratory-based processes as well as in scalable processes. We take the view that understanding the formation of the solution-processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photoactive layer, where crucial photovoltaic processes take place, is the one of the most crucial steps to developing strategies towards the implementation of organic solar cells with high efficiency and manufacturability. In this dissertation, we investigate the mechanism of the BHJ layer formation during solution processing from common lab-based processes, such as spin-coating, with the aim of understanding the roles of materials, formulations and processing conditions and subsequently using this insight to enable the scalable manufacturing of high efficiency organic solar cells by such methods as <b>wire-bar</b> coating and blade-coating. To do so, we have developed state-of-the-art in situ diagnostics techniques to provide us with insight into the thin film formation process. As a first step, we have developed a modified spin-coater which allows us to perform in situ UV-visible absorption measurements during spin coating and provides key insight into the formation and evolution of polymer aggregates in solution and during the transformation to the solid state. Using this method, we have investigated the formation of organic BHJs made of a blend of poly (3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) and fullerene, reference materials in the organic solar cell field. We show that process kinetics directly influence the microstructure and morphology of the bulk heterojunction, highlighting the value of in situ measurements. We have investigated the influence of crystallization dynamics of a wide-range of small-molecule donors and their solidification pathways on the processing routes needed for attaining high-performance solar cells. The study revealed the reason behind the need of empirically-adopted processing strategies such as solvent additives or alternatively thermal or solvent vapor annealing for achieving optimal performance. The study has provided a new perspective to materials design linking the need for solvent additives or annealing to the ease of crystallization of small-molecule donors and the presence or absence of transient phases before crystallization. From there, we have extended our investigation to small-molecule (p-DTS (FBTTh 2) 2) fullerene blend solar cells, where we have revealed new insight into the crucial role of solvent additives. Our work has also touched upon modern polymers, such as PBDTTPD, where we have found the choice of additives impacts the formation mechanism of the BHJ. Finally, we have performed a comparative study of the BHJ film formation dynamics during spin coating versus <b>wire-bar</b> coating of p-DTS(FBTTh 2) 2 : fullerene blends that has helped in curbing the performance gap between lab-based and scalable techniques. This was done by implementing a new apparatus that combines the benefits of rapid thin film drying common to spin coating with scalability of <b>wire-bar</b> coating. Using the new apparatus, we successfully attain similar performance of solar cell devices to the ones fabricated by spin coating with dramatically reduced material waste...|$|E
