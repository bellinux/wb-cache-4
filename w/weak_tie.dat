A connector is essentially the social equivalent of a computer network hub. They usually know people across an array of social, cultural, professional, and economic circles, and make a habit of introducing people who work or live in different circles. They are people who [...] "link us up with the world...people with a special gift for bringing the world together". They are [...] "a handful of people with a truly extraordinary knack [...] making friends and acquaintances". Gladwell characterizes these individuals as having social networks of over one hundred people. To illustrate, he cites the following examples: the midnight ride of Paul Revere, Milgram's experiments in the small world problem, the [...] "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon" [...] trivia game, Dallas businessman Roger Horchow, and Chicagoan Lois Weisberg, a person who understands the concept of the <b>weak</b> <b>tie.</b> Gladwell attributes the social success of Connectors to the fact that [...] "their ability to span many different worlds is a function of something intrinsic to their personality, some combination of curiosity, self-confidence, sociability, and energy".|$|E

By the {{definition}} of Strong Triadic Closure, a <b>weak</b> <b>tie</b> would develop between nodes A and C. However, this contradicts the fact that B is a local gatekeeper. Thus {{at least one of the}} nodes involved in a local bridge needs to be a <b>weak</b> <b>tie</b> to prevent triadic closure from occurring.|$|E

40|$|Building on {{the work}} of Granovetter [1973. “The Strength of Weak Ties. ” American Journal of Sociology 78 (6) : 1360 – 1380. ], <b>weak</b> <b>ties</b> are assumed to {{play a vital role in}} {{processes}} of integration. In this paper, the focus lies on <b>weak</b> <b>ties</b> that cut across ethnic boundaries, connecting Muslim immigrants to members of the ethnic majority in six European host societies. The aim is twofold: a descriptive analysis of the existence of those crosscutting <b>weak</b> <b>ties</b> amongst different groups of Muslim immigrants and an explanatory analysis focusing on the structural factors that make the establishment of such ties more likely. In the latter part, the native populations are also taken into account, allowing for a bidirectional perspective. Using ordinal logistic regression models, we found that emancipatory factors such as education and language skills are positively associated with having <b>weak</b> <b>ties,</b> whereas conservative values and religiosity decrease the likelihood of establishing many <b>weak</b> <b>ties.</b> A diverse neighbourhood appears to play a pivotal role in the formation of <b>weak</b> <b>ties</b> from both a native and an immigrant perspective...|$|R
50|$|Strong Triadic Closure Property {{is that if}} a node {{has strong}} ties to two neighbors, then these neighbors must have at least a <b>weak</b> <b>tie</b> between them. A local bridge occurs, on the other hand, when a node is acting as a {{gatekeeper}} between two neighboring nodes who are not otherwise connected. In a network that follows the Strong Triadic Closure Property, one of the ties between nodes involved in a local bridge needs to be a <b>weak</b> <b>tie.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Labov's 1966 {{study of}} African American Vernacular English in South Harlem, {{revealed}} that second-order actors in African American social networks were the initiators of linguistic {{change in their}} communities. Though these second-order actors, or [...] "lames" [...] were not held in high regard by {{the leaders of the}} speech network, they had connections to other networks, and were sources of new linguistic variables. This study served as the basis of the <b>Weak</b> <b>Tie</b> Theory proposed by Milroy and Milroy.|$|E
50|$|Consequential strangers {{can also}} support {{intimate}} ties, {{especially in the}} family. In a given day, parents deal with child care providers, teachers, coaches, and other parents who can offer tangible aid, such as car pools, information about school policies, as well as emotional support to the family. Many peripheral relationships are satisfying, although some are also the cause of daily hassles. When a <b>weak</b> <b>tie</b> is bothersome, one can often walk away. However, there are certain consequential strangers from whom escape is impossible—a coworker, neighbor, or teacher that rankles.|$|E

30|$|Note that {{constraining}} {{the number}} of opportunities {{to be less than}} a node’s neighborhood size drives the net downside to <b>weak</b> <b>ties.</b> If everyone encountered every one of their social contacts when they had new information, the presence of <b>weak</b> <b>ties</b> would not have a net negative effect on diffusion. <b>Weak</b> <b>ties</b> would be less effective channels through which information spreads; their presence would not be harmful, but would simply not add as much to the speed and reach of information as strong ties. If, however, a person’s opportunities are constrained to be less than her full set of social contacts, then the presence of <b>weak</b> <b>ties</b> can have a net negative effect. Just how small x is relative to a person’s total number of social contacts determines just how damaging the presence of <b>weak</b> <b>ties</b> is.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} whether <b>weak</b> <b>ties</b> play an important role in explaining criminal activities. We first develop a model where individuals learn about crime opportunities by interacting with active criminals. These interactions can take the form of either strong or <b>weak</b> <b>ties.</b> We find that increasing the percentage of <b>weak</b> <b>ties</b> induces more transitions from non-crime to crime and thus the crime rate in the economy increases. This is because, when the percentage of <b>weak</b> <b>ties</b> is high, delinquents and non-delinquents are in close contact with each other. We then test these predictions using the U. S. National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health (AddHealth), which contains unique detailed informations on friendship relationships among teenagers. The theoretical predictions of our model are confirmed by the empirical analysis since we find that <b>weak</b> <b>ties,</b> as measured by friends of friends, have a positive impact on criminal activities...|$|R
5000|$|In Ballymacarrett, one of {{the villages}} the {{researchers}} surveyed, unrounded u was most often used by young males and females, who had weak ties to the working class networks, but use the variables frequently to project an image of working-class toughness. These young people often interacted with members of other social networks, and thus spread the u realization through their own social networks, {{which resulted in the}} adoption of unrounded u in most of Belfast. These results provide support for the <b>weak</b> <b>tie</b> theory of language change, because it was the actors on the peripheries of social networks who were responsible for spreading linguistic change.|$|E
5000|$|In 2000, John Seely Brown and Paul Duguid {{released}} The Social Life of Information {{and introduced}} {{the concept of}} Networks of Practice (NoP's), an informal and emergent social network that supports the sharing of information between individuals clustered around a practice. Building on the work done by Jean Lave and Étienne Wenger on community of practice (CoP's), Seely Brown and Duguid argued that a network differed from a community in that the relationships among members were more informal and fluid when compared to communities. While CoP's were often localized with strong inter-personal relationships providing group cohesion, NoPs were more global with relationships that were both strong tie and <b>weak</b> <b>tie</b> relationships.|$|E
5000|$|Included in the {{definition}} of absent ties, according to the American sociologist Mark Granovetter, are those relationships (or ties) without substantial significance, such as [...] "nodding" [...] relationships between people living on the same street, or the [...] "tie", for example, to a frequent vendor one would buy from. Furthermore, the fact that two people may know each other by name does not necessarily qualify the existence of a <b>weak</b> <b>tie.</b> If their interaction is negligible the tie may be absent. The [...] "strength" [...] of an interpersonal tie is a linear combination of the amount of time, the emotional intensity, the intimacy (or mutual confiding), and the reciprocal services which characterize each tie.|$|E
30|$|In demand-driven {{information}} environments, {{the fact}} that a node may specifically approach her <b>weak</b> <b>ties,</b> and {{the fact that}} she may do so with greater persistence, may overcome the problems of limited capacity and render <b>weak</b> <b>ties</b> beneficial. This article shows that in supply-driven environments, if opportunities are constrained and people have reason to selectively share information with some instead of others, then <b>weak</b> <b>ties</b> may at best be weak for the diffusion of novel information.|$|R

40|$|<b>Weak</b> <b>ties,</b> {{introduced}} in the seminal paper by Granovetter [6], refer to people’s relationships with acquaintances outside their social cirle (i. e., acquaintances with which they interact infrequently). We show that <b>weak</b> <b>ties</b> {{play an important role}} on the dissemination of content updates over a mobile social network. From a practical perspective, <b>weak</b> <b>ties</b> can be used to design strategies for limiting the bandwidth usage on such a network, without severely impacting the speed with which the content is disseminated. Moreover, the importance of <b>weak</b> <b>ties</b> can be traced on the effect they have on the edge expansion of the social network. By identifying this relationship, we extend and validate earlier work [7], that characterizes the speed of content dissemination in terms of the network’s edge expansion...|$|R
5000|$|To {{reason why}} this is the case, if {{a circle of radius}} r is drawn around the initial node it will have nodal density [...] where n is the number of nodes in the {{circular}} area. As this circle gets expanded further out, the number of nodes in the given area increases proportional to [...] as the probability of having a random link with any node remains proportional , meaning the probability of the original node having a <b>weak</b> <b>tie</b> with any node a given distance away is effectively independent of distance. Therefore, it is concluded that with , long-range edges are evenly distributed over all distances, which is effective for letting us funnel to our final destination.|$|E
5000|$|Most of {{the early}} work in heterophily {{was done in the}} 1960s by Everett Rogers in his book Diffusion Of Innovations. According to Rogers, [...] "Heterophily, the mirror {{opposite}} of homophily, is defined as the degree to which pairs of individuals who interact are different in certain attributes". This is in contrast to homophily, the likelihood that individuals are to surround themselves with those they share similarities with. An example of heterophily would be to individuals from different ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds becoming friends. Through his work Rogers showed that heterophilious networks were better able to spread innovations. Later, scholars such as Paul Burton have drawn connections between modern Social Network Analysis as practiced by Mark Granovetter in his theory of weak ties and the work of Georg Simmel. Burton found that Simmel's notion of [...] "the stranger" [...] is equivalent to Granovetter's <b>weak</b> <b>tie</b> in that both can bridge homophilious networks, turning them into one larger heterophilious network.|$|E
5000|$|Sociolinguists have {{recently}} begun to focus their studies on weak links: individuals who are not closely tied to a group, such as people who move frequently or live in isolated areas. The <b>weak</b> <b>tie</b> theory, first proposed by Milroy and Milroy in 1983, posits that language change is propagated {{by the people who}} are second order members of social networks. [...] Agents who are weakly connected are more likely to come into contact with new linguistic variants, since they {{spend most of their time}} interacting with people outside of the central network. [...] Loosely connected individuals are also under less social pressure to conform to group language practices than integral members. Weak-tie social network theory postulates that linguistic variables are spread by means of weak, uni-dimensional social links between non-central individuals. Therefore it is the case that language change will have the propensity to be faster in larger communities rather than in smaller communities. Support for this theory is found in Labov's study of [...] "lames" [...] in Harlem, and in Lesley Milroy's 1987 Belfast study.|$|E

30|$|Adding {{a larger}} and larger number of <b>weak</b> <b>ties</b> to the {{existing}} network increases {{the total number of}} links present, but actually reduces the rate of information spread throughout the village. The reason is that although the <b>weak</b> <b>ties</b> added at random are allowing information to possibly jump to new regions of the network (to non-coethnics), nodes with strong ties who received new <b>weak</b> <b>ties</b> have changed neighborhoods. That change results in a different option set for spreading information. These nodes, like all nodes, will encounter x of their neighbors. The more that the neighborhood is comprised of non-coethnics, the more likely these opportunities will include those to whom information does not flow as freely. Adding <b>weak</b> <b>ties</b> effectively crowds out the use of the strong ties which transmit information more readily.|$|R

5000|$|The {{concepts}} of weak and strong ties in a marketing {{and social sciences}} context relates to {{the intensity of the}} relationships between members of a network. The strength of a tie according to Professor Mark Granovetter can be analyzed by looking at a combination of; the amount of time, the emotional intensity, the intimacy and mutual confiding, and the reciprocal services between those which the tie exists.A strong tie relationship obviously exhibits high levels of the afore mentioned attributes and in a relationship between two parties which is a strong tie there is assumed to be mutual choice for both parties involvement in the relationship. Strong ties are often found in highly dense groups of nodes who share many similarities and connections within the groups. Thus removing one or two strong ties in a group does not affect the information distribution through a group due to the intense interlinking present. [...] Weak ties refer to the relationships that are present between individuals which are not actively sought out or maintained. Where strong ties require high levels of commitment and other factors a <b>weak</b> <b>tie</b> only needs a small amount of connection to function effectively and does not require mutual agreement to be present. Nor do they require similar interests across nodes in a network, on the contrary weak links occur due to different interests but are created through often minimal factors. They link groups or clusters together despite differences in the clusters and enable the flow of information or diffusion of ideas to take place across an entire network rather it remaining in one cluster. The idea that removing strong ties from a network will not have as big of an effect as removing a weak one. The concept of bridges is central to this idea. A bridge is a connection which acts as the only way for information to travel between two nodes in a network, there are no other connections available to get said information across. Due to the nature of bridges strong ties are not able to be bridges due to the interconnected nature of strong ties in a community and the presence of alternate connections to facilitate lateral diffusion. Conversely weak ties can be bridges because they are often the only links between groups or nodes, however {{it is important to note}} that not all weak links are bridges there may be other connections, but all bridges are weak ties, thus transmission probabilities rely heavily on them. An example of how weak ties can be effective at reaching a larger audience than strong ties is shown by Rapoport and Horvath’s 1961 study of a high school in Michigan. 857 students were asked to rank their eight top friends from 1(best friend) to 8(associate). The results of the survey showed that those rated one or two were a small minority of the students, where those who were seen as more associates canvassed a vast majority of the sample. In this example the strong links were those rated as best friends where the weak links who had the ability for far greater diffusion of information were those considered associates. Through utilizing weak links available in the market a firm operating in one system or niche perhaps would potentially be able expand or tap into different markets through utilizing a weak link and diversify. Marketers also need to be aware that just because their advertisements are targeted specifically at a segment where they believe it will go down well or be acceptable such an adult advertisement on a billboard in a ‘suitable location’ or a giveaway on a beer bottle, due to weak links it has potential to be able to affect those outside the target audience or group who would find it appropriate.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Based on the <b>weak</b> <b>tie</b> theory, {{this paper}} proposes {{a series of}} {{connection}} indicators of <b>weak</b> <b>tie</b> subnets and <b>weak</b> <b>tie</b> nodes to detect research topics, recognize their connections, and understand their evolution. Design/methodology/approach: First, keywords are extracted from article titles and preprocessed. Second, high-frequency keywords are selected to generate <b>weak</b> <b>tie</b> co-occurrence networks. By removing the internal lines of clustered sub-topic networks, {{we focus on the}} analysis of <b>weak</b> <b>tie</b> subnets' composition and functions and the <b>weak</b> <b>tie</b> nodes' roles. Findings: The research topics' clusters and themes changed yearly; the subnets clustered with technique-related and methodology-related topics have been the core, important subnets for years; while close subnets are highly independent, research topics are generally concentrated and most topics are application-related; the roles and functions of nodes and weak ties are diversified. Research limitations: The parameter values are somewhat inconsistent; the <b>weak</b> <b>tie</b> subnets and nodes are classified based on empirical observations, and the conclusions are not verified or compared to other methods. Practical implications: The research is valuable for detecting important research topics as well as their roles, interrelations, and evolution trends. Originality/value: To contribute to the strength of <b>weak</b> <b>tie</b> theory, the research translates weak and strong ties concepts to co-occurrence strength, and analyzes weak ties' functions. Also, the research proposes a quantitative method to classify and measure the topics' clusters and nodes...|$|E
30|$|The {{observed}} higher {{influence of}} <b>weaker</b> <b>ties</b> here follows the phenomenon described by Granovetter [79] that individuals are often influenced by others {{with whom they}} have tenuous or even random relationships - i.e., <b>weak</b> <b>ties.</b> Our observation of the similar level of influence across tie strengths {{is in line with}} a study of the impact of strong and <b>weak</b> <b>ties</b> on the acceptance of a new product by Goldenberg et al. [90] that concluded that the influence of <b>weak</b> <b>ties</b> is as strong as the influence of strong ties, and their effect approximates or exceeds that of strong ties, in all stages of the product life cycle. In addition, they also observed that when personal networks are small, <b>weak</b> <b>ties</b> were found to have a stronger impact on information dissemination than strong ties, which is likely the case for our result in Figure  12 (a).

Our results indicate that both <b>weak</b> and strong <b>ties</b> matter in the migration decision process, although the impact of <b>weak</b> <b>ties</b> is higher than that of strong ties. We also show that one underestimates the effect of social networks on migration by not taking into account the strong ties in the mobility process.

Note that our notion of being influential here means being likely that ego-subject is to share a common choice as reflected by the fraction of social ties’ mode choices observed.|$|R
