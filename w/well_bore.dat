5|$|The Marcellus {{natural gas}} trend, which {{encompasses}} 104,000 square miles and stretches across Pennsylvania and West Virginia, and into southeast Ohio and upstate New York, {{is the largest}} source of natural gas in the United States, and production was still growing rapidly in 2013. The Marcellus {{is an example of}} shale gas, natural gas trapped in low-permeability shale, and requires the well completion method of hydraulic fracturing to allow the gas to flow to the <b>well</b> <b>bore.</b> The surge in drilling activity in the Marcellus Shale since 2008 has generated both economic benefits and environmental concerns—and thus, considerable controversy.|$|E
25|$|Hydraulic {{fracturing}} {{carried out}} in the Barnett Shale is done by pumping a mixture of water, sand, and various chemical additives (to affect viscosity, flow rates, etc.) into the <b>well</b> <b>bore</b> at a sufficient pressure to create and propagate a fracture in the surrounding rock formation down hole. This is crucial in low permeability rock as it exposes more of the formation to the <b>well</b> <b>bore</b> and greater volumes of gas can be produced by the increased surface area. Without hydraulic fracturing, the wells would not produce at an economically feasible rate.|$|E
25|$|Often called {{conventional}} heavy oil, this low-density oil can {{be recovered}} by conventional drilling techniques or by waterflood, a technique of injecting {{water into the}} reservoir to increase pressure, thus forcing the oil toward the <b>well</b> <b>bore.</b> When these techniques work, heavy oil is like the more commercially attractive lighter grades of oil. But heavy oil can also be quite viscous. It can need some form of heat or solvent and pressure before it can flow into a <b>well</b> <b>bore</b> to be produced. When heavy oil requires these techniques to go into production, it is known as non-conventional heavy oil.|$|E

The zone {{is open to the}} <b>well</b> <b>bore.</b> In this case little expense is generated with perforations log interpretation is not critical. The well can be deepened easily and it is easily converted to screen and liner. However, excessive gas and water production is difficult to control, and may require frequent clean outs. Also the interval can not be selectively stimulated.|$|E
25|$|Since {{parts of}} this region have been {{producing}} gas from wells drilled to the deeper Oriskany Formation sandstone, older wells that are no longer viable can be reused, either by fracturing the Marcellus layer in the existing <b>well</b> <b>bore,</b> or by refinishing the bore using horizontal drilling into the Marcellus. Re-use of the existing infrastructure has both environmental {{as well as economic}} benefits, because in addition to avoiding development of new drilling sites and wells, existing transportation facilities can be reused.|$|E

50|$|The {{change in}} voltage through the <b>well</b> <b>bore</b> {{is caused by}} a buildup of charge on the <b>well</b> <b>bore</b> walls. Clays and shales (which are {{composed}} predominantly of clays) will generate one charge and permeable formations such as sandstone will generate an opposite one. Spontaneous potentials occur when two aqueous solutions with different ionic concentrations are placed in contact through a porous, semi-permeable membrane. In nature, ions tend to migrate from high to low ionic concentrations. In the case of SP logging, the two aqueous solutions are the <b>well</b> <b>bore</b> fluid (drilling mud) and the formation water (connate water). The potential opposite shales is called the baseline, and typically shifts only slowly over the depth of the borehole.|$|E
50|$|This is {{the most}} common method of a {{contingency}} well kill. If there is a sudden need to kill a well quickly, without the time for rigging up for circulation, the more blunt instrument of bullheading may be used. This involves simply pumping the kill fluid directly down the <b>well</b> <b>bore,</b> forcing the <b>well</b> <b>bore</b> fluids back into the reservoir. This can be effective at achieving the central aim of a well kill; building up a sufficient hydrostatic head in the <b>well</b> <b>bore.</b> However, it can be limited by the burst-pressure capabilities of the tubing or casing, and can risk damaging the reservoir by forcing undesired materials into it. The principal advantage is that it can be done with little advanced planning.|$|E
