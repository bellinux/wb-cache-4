On another occasion, the singer described the single as an [...] "old kind of style, but a new style. It's like eurodance." [...] According to her, the lyrical message is [...] " [...] of expressing the girls' need to be loved [...] and sometimes you just need to tell to the guy, 'tell me that you love me'". Jonathan Currinn from CelebMix noted, [...] "As for the meaning behind the song, the lyrics suggest a relationship where a guy is always breaking her heart even though she knows that he actually cares for her.

60|$|See--of all Obadiah's {{wealth and}} glory, the Bible {{does not say}} one word. It is {{actually}} not worth mentioning. People admired Obadiah, I doubt not, while he was alive; envied him too, tried to thrust {{him out of his}} place, slander him to King Ahab, drive him out of favour, and step into his place, that they might enjoy his wealth and his power instead of him. The fine outside of Obadiah was what they saw, and coveted, and envied--as we are tempted now to say in our hearts, 'Ah, if <b>I</b> was rich <b>like</b> that man. Ah, if <b>I</b> could buy <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked,</b> go where <b>I</b> <b>liked,</b> do <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked,</b> like that great Lord!'-- and yet, that is but the outside, the shell, the gay clothing, not the persons themselves.
