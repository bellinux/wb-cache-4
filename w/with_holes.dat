5|$|A carcass was {{a hollow}} {{projectile}} usually formed either by an iron cage of ribs joining two small rings or a cast iron ball <b>with</b> <b>holes.</b> A carcass was {{so named because}} the iron cage was thought to resemble the ribs of a body. A carcass {{was filled with a}} highly flammable mixture. Carcasses were used for the first time by the French under Louis XIV in 1672.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of mature or decaying trees <b>with</b> <b>holes</b> suitable for nesting is essential, and trees such as oak, beech and hickory are favored {{in the east}} since they provide edible seeds. Although suitable habitat is distributed continentally, it is discontinuous, and the separate populations of this non-migratory species have diverged to form distinct regional subspecies.|$|E
5|$|Head {{injury is}} present in ancient myths that may date back before {{recorded}} history. Skulls found in battleground graves <b>with</b> <b>holes</b> drilled over fracture lines suggest that trepanation {{may have been used}} to treat TBI in ancient times. Ancient Mesopotamians knew of head injury and some of its effects, including seizures, paralysis, and loss of sight, hearing or speech. The Edwin Smith Papyrus, written around 1650–1550BC, describes various head injuries and symptoms and classifies them based on their presentation and tractability. Ancient Greek physicians including Hippocrates understood the brain {{to be the center of}} thought, probably due to their experience with head trauma.|$|E

5|$|The {{ground was}} renamed KitKat Crescent in January 2005, {{as part of}} a {{sponsorship}} deal in which Nestlé made a donation to the club, although the ground was still commonly referred to as Bootham Crescent. In January 2010 the deal expired, when Nestlé ended all their sponsorship arrangements with the club. There has not been any major investment in the ground since the 1990s, and it has faced problems <b>with</b> <b>holes</b> in the Main Stand roof, crumbling in the Grosvenor Road End, drainage problems and toilet conditions. Bootham Crescent holds a capacity of 8,256, with seating for 3,409.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} the statue's {{workmanship}} caused problems during its first half-century; the horse's tail fell off the day after it was installed at the Great Exhibition, and forty years after its installation it was discovered to be riddled <b>with</b> <b>holes</b> and to have never been properly attached to its pedestal. It narrowly escaped destruction during the Second World War when a German bomb dropped during the Blitz landed a few metres away and peppered it with shrapnel. The pedestal and the horse's tail were damaged and Richard's sword was bent by the blast. In 2009, the Parliamentary authorities undertook a project to conserve and restore the statue.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} as a student, Gaudí was able to study a {{collection}} of photographs of Egyptian, Indian, Persian, Mayan, Chinese and Japanese art owned by the School of Architecture. The collection also included Moorish monuments in Spain, which left a deep mark on him and served as an inspiration in many of his works. He also studied the book Plans, elevations, sections and details of the Alhambra by Owen Jones, which he borrowed from the School's library. He took various structural and ornamental solutions from nazarí and mudéjar art, which he used with variations and stylistic freedom in his works. Notably, Gaudí observed of Islamic art its spatial uncertainty, its concept of structures with limitless space; its feeling of sequence, fragmented <b>with</b> <b>holes</b> and partitions, which create a divide without disrupting the feeling of open space by enclosing it with barriers.|$|E

5|$|Karpf {{ordered the}} slow Albatross {{to make for}} neutral Swedish waters, where {{theoretically}} she would be protected from the Russian attack, while he tried to escape with Augsburg to the south. Soon, all four Russian cruisers were firing at Albatross, allowing Augsburg and the torpedo boats to escape freely. At 07:20, Albatross was hit for the first time. As the range closed, the Russian ships came close enough that Albatross could reply with her 8.8guns, but {{by this time the}} Russian fire was beginning to take its toll. The forecastle was riddled <b>with</b> <b>holes,</b> the foremast was knocked down, and the conning tower was destroyed, killing the men inside. At 07:45, Albatross entered Swedish territorial waters, but the Russians continued firing for another twenty minutes, checking their fire only at 08:07 after the ship had Östergarn Sound. By this time, the ship was badly damaged and was listing heavily to port. Fearing that the ship would capsize, her captain ordered her to be beached.|$|E
5|$|Numerous fady protect {{wilderness}} areas, particularly {{including the}} Ankarana massif. Excessive cutting of mangrove trees for wood or {{the setting of}} bush fires are both prohibited, as {{is the use of}} nets <b>with</b> <b>holes</b> less than 15 millimeters to prevent catching immature fish. Certain species are protected through fady that forbid hunting them, including sharks, rays and crocodiles. Many fady also exist to regulate relations between the sexes. For instance, it is taboo for a girl to wash her own brother's clothing. Conservative communities adhere to a fady against medical injections, surgery or modern medicines due to their association with their historic enemies the Merina, who were the first to use them widely; instead, tromba ceremonies and traditional herbal remedies are commonly used for healing. These taboos are most strongly applied in the center of Antankarana territory around the village of Ambatoharaña and less so in the villages at the periphery of the region.|$|E
5|$|Prevented from {{cutting the}} French line ahead of Achille, HMS Brunswick turned {{and tried to}} cross aft of her, between Achille and Vengeur. Seeing the manoeuvre, Renaudin also {{accelerated}} to close this new gap, and Brunswick and Vengeur collided, the anchor of Brunswick becoming entangled in the rigging of Vengeur. Vengeur fired an entire broadside at point-blank range, but was then unable to fire her main batteries again, the ships being so close as to prevent French gunners from ramming ammunition into their guns; in contrast, British gunners used rammers with semi-rigid rope handles instead of wooden handles, {{and were able to}} reload and maintain a sustained fire, riddling Vengeur <b>with</b> <b>holes.</b> The fight went on for four hours, until Brunswick, after shattering the rudder of Vengeur to prevent her from manoeuvring, separated at 12:45. Her fire also opened a large hole in the hull of Vengeur.|$|E

5|$|The {{main body}} of most {{clarinets}} is divided into the upper joint, the holes and most keys of which are operated by the left hand, and the lower joint <b>with</b> <b>holes</b> and most keys operated by the right hand. Some clarinets have a single joint: on some basset horns and larger clarinets the two joints are held together with a screw clamp and are usually not disassembled for storage. The left thumb operates both a tone hole and the register key. On some models of clarinet, such as many Albert system clarinets and increasingly some higher-end Boehm system clarinets, the register key is a 'wraparound' key, with the key {{on the back of}} the clarinet and the pad on the front. Advocates of the wraparound register key say it improves sound, and it is harder for moisture to accumulate in the tube beneath the pad. Nevertheless, there is a consensus among repair techs that this type of register key is harder to keep in adjustment, i.e., it is hard to have enough spring pressure to close the hole securely.|$|E
5|$|This {{treatise}} documented a {{wide range}} of pharmaceutical practices, including the use of ephedrine as a drug. It includes valuable information on metallurgy and the steel and iron industries during 11th century China. He created a systematic approach to listing various different minerals and their use in medicinal concoctions, such as all the variously known forms of mica {{that could be used to}} cure ills through digestion. He wrote of the subconchoidal fracture of native cinnabar, signs of ore beds, and provided description on crystal form. Similar to the ore channels formed by circulation of ground water written of by the later German scientist Georgius Agricola, Su Song made similar statements concerning copper carbonate, as did the earlier Rihua Bencao of 970 with copper sulphate. Su's book was also the first pharmaceutical treatise written in China to describe the flax, Urtica thunbergiana, and Corchoropsis tomentosa (crenata) plants. According to Edward H. Schafer, Su accurately described the translucent quality of fine realgar, its origin from pods found in rocky river gorges, its matrix being pitted <b>with</b> <b>holes</b> and having a deep red, almost purple color, and that the mineral varied in sizes ranging from the size of a pea to a walnut.|$|E
5|$|Thousands {{of female}} statuettes dated {{as early as}} c. 5500 BCE have been {{recovered}} at Mehrgarh, {{one of the most}} important Neolithic sites in world archeology, and a precursor to the great Indus Valley Civilization. In Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, major cities of the Indus valley civilization, female figurines were found in almost all households indicating the presence of cults of goddess worship. Most figurines are naked and have elaborate coiffures. Some figurines have ornaments or horns on the head and a few are in poses that expose the genitals. Several small circular objects <b>with</b> <b>holes</b> in middle, possibly representing yoni, were also found. The objects and images found suggest that the goddess cults of Indus valley civilization were associated with fertility. A seal shows a male figure standing over a seated female figure with a sickle. It probably suggests an association between the female figure and crops, and possibly implies a ritual sacrifice where the blood of the victim was offered to the goddess for ensuring agricultural productivity.|$|E

5|$|York were {{relegated to}} the Conference National for 2004–05, which brought an end to 72 years of Football League {{football}} at Bootham Crescent. In January 2005 the ground was renamed KitKat Crescent, {{as part of a}} sponsorship deal under which Nestlé donated £100,000 to the club. This money went towards covering the shortfall the club faced paying BCH directors, Persimmon and stamp duty when buying the ground. The ground was still commonly referred to as Bootham Crescent. The deal expired in January 2010, when Nestlé ended all their sponsorship arrangements with the club. York returned to the Football League for 2012–13, and their first League Two match at Bootham Crescent was a 3–1 defeat to Wycombe Wanderers on 18 August 2012, before a 4,591 crowd.

5|$|Jade burial suit: Burial suits made of jade {{existed in}} China during the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD). Confirming ancient records about Han royalty and nobility buried in jade burial suits, archaeologists {{discovered}} in June 1968 the tombs and jade burial suits of Prince Liu Sheng (d. 113 BC) {{and his wife}} Dou Wan in Hebei province. Liu's suit, in twelve flexible sections, comprised 2,690 square pieces of green jade <b>with</b> <b>holes</b> punctured in {{the four corners of}} each piece so that they could be sewn together with gold thread. The total weight of the gold thread used in his suit was 1,110 g (39oz). Princess Dou Wan's suit had 2,156 pieces of jade stitched together with 703 g (24.7oz) of gold thread. Although jade burial outer wears and head masks appear in tombs of the early Han Dynasty, burial suits did not appear until the reign of Emperor Wen of Han (r. 180–157 BC), with the earliest being found in the Shizishan site. A total of 22 Western Han (202 BC– 9 AD) and 27 Eastern Han (25–220 AD) complete and partial jade burial suits were uncovered between 1954 and 1996. They are found mainly in Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu and Henan, as well as at Yangjiawan, Dongyuan, Guangzhou, Mawangdui, Mianyang and Shizhaishan. The jade burial suit gradually disappeared when it was forbidden in 222 by Emperor Wen of Wei.|$|E
