Cronkite immediately agreed. The ASU program acquired status and respect from its namesake.|$|E

However, the men join him and, in essence, lose {{themselves}} in the hard work. Prushevsky does not follow suit. A girl asks him to teach her knowledge, and he leaves the worksite with her.

25|$|Males {{who are in}} a {{committed}} relationship, in other words have a restricted sociosexual orientation, will have different sexual strategies compared to males who have an unrestricted sociosexual orientation. Males with a restricted sociosexual orientation will be less <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> sex outside of their committed relationship, and adjust their strategies according to their desire for commitment and emotional closeness with their partner. It has been found that such males are less likely to approach attractive females who have greater waist-to-hip ratios (0.68-0.72). It has been found that a greater waist-to-hip ratio, the ideal being 0.7, is associated with youthfulness, physical attractiveness and reproductive potential. Therefore, such females would be viewed as a risk to the male’s current sexual partner. Consequently, males will adjust their sexual strategies by showing less willingness to approach such females.|$|E
25|$|The Seminoles, {{who spoke}} the same {{language}} as the Creeks, {{did not have any}} schools or churches; the board of foreign missions directed Loughridge to visit them and learn {{whether or not they were}} willing to establish a mission and school. In the summer of 1846, he visited them with his interpreter, and learned that the most of their chiefs were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> schools and allow preaching in their nation. In April 1847, Hon. Walter Lowrie, secretary of the board of foreign missions, New York, visited the mission, and gave new life to the Christian cause of education by entering into an agreement with the chiefs to enlarge the Koweta Mission, and to establish the Tullahassee Mission, that would accommodate eighty students, forty boys and forty girls; the schools were funded by both the Presbyterian Church and the Creek school fund.|$|E

25|$|Some {{sources have}} {{discussed}} {{a double standard}} regarding the conduct of female versus male teachers. When it comes to sexual harassment or sexual abuse cases involving a male teacher as the perpetrator to a female student, severe punishments are often the result. According to David Ring, a lawyer working with sexual abuse cases, {{it is not uncommon}} for the male teachers to be convicted, face jail time, or owe partial civil damages to the student victim depending on the severity of the case. When a female teacher is the perpetrator of sexual harassment to a male student, there are arguments that the female teachers are given lighter sentences and the male victims are given lower amounts of compensation due to the reasoning that teenage males would be <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> sexual encounters with older, female teachers as a response to changes in their hormones.|$|E
25|$|Marcel Proulx {{resigned}} as Dion's Quebec lieutenant {{hours before the}} Harper government's throne speech, taking the fall for the three by-election losses. Dion first approached Montreal MPs Denis Coderre and Pablo Rodriguez to succeed Proulx, but they declined. That evening he named Senator Céline Hervieux-Payette to the vacant post. While the Party was divided {{on whether or not}} the government should be toppled on a confidence vote regarding the Throne Speech, Dion mentioned in a statement in the House of Commons on 17 October that the Liberals will support the Throne Speech but with major amendments including the Kyoto Protocol and the end of mission in Afghanistan by 2009 and had criticized the government on several aspects including the economy, seniors and child poverty, the crime policy, the Senate reform. The latter amendment proposal was rejected by the New Democratic Party who are favouring an immediate end to the mission. Dion explained the decision as that Canadians are not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a third election in just over three years. All Liberal members abstained from voting on the Throne Speech on 24 October 2007, which passed 126–79.|$|E

[...] During the Adelaide Test in 195051 he [...] "walked", ensuring that the unlucky John Warr took at least one wicket for the series. [...] Johnson was not above some gamesmanship, resorting to time-wasting tactics to avoid defeat in the final Test of the 1956 series against England.

500|$|According to Reiser, Cameron {{cast him}} against type as a villain.

In a deleted scene during Ripley's incursion into the Alien hive, shown in the 2010 Blu-ray edition of the Alien Anthology, she discovers a cocooned Burke who reveals {{that he has been}} impregnated; he begs Ripley to kill him, but instead she hands him a grenade for him to detonate.|$|E

500|$|According to numismatic {{historian}} Don Taxay, [...] "under the circumstances, Peale's {{adoption of}} a process not normally used at the Mint, together with its catastrophic failure, seems more than coincidental." [...] When Longacre completed the double eagle dies, they were rejected by Peale, who stated that the design was engraved too deeply to fully impress the coin, and the pieces would not stack properly. [...] Taxay, however, noted that the one surviving 1849 double eagle displays no such problems, and by appearance would be level in a stack. Peale complained to Patterson, who wrote to Treasury Secretary William M. Meredith asking for Longacre's removal on December 25, 1849, on the ground he could not make proper dies. Meredith was apparently <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Longacre fired, but relented after the Engraver journeyed to Washington and met with him personally.|$|E

Many critics noted that Stacy's presence affected House's behaviour, Diane Kristine of Blog Critics stated that, with Stacy, House was [...] "almost nice". While Stacy has told House on several occasions that she loves Mark, she is still very much in love with House and was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an affair with him; however, she admits that she finds House selfish and that [...] "with Mark, there's room for [...] ".|$|E

Before agreeing to do the Sweet Thursday project, the duo had considered other projects for their next work together, such as an adaptation of the film Saratoga Trunk. A proposal made by attorney David Merrick to adapt a series of works by Marcel Pagnol to which Merrick held the stage rights fell through when the duo were not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Merrick be an associate producer; Merrick took the project elsewhere, and it was developed into the hit Fanny.

500|$|One of {{the most}} notorious of these sectaries was the zealous Samuel Gorton who had been {{expelled}} from both Plymouth Colony and the settlement at Portsmouth, and then was refused freemanship in Providence Plantation. [...] In 1642, he settled in what became Warwick, but the following year he was arrested with some followers and brought to Boston for dubious legal reasons. [...] Here he was forced to attend a Cotton sermon in October 1643 which he confuted. [...] Further attempts at correcting his religious opinions were in vain. [...] Cotton was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Gorton put to death in order to [...] "preserve New England's good name in England," [...] where he felt that such theological views were greatly detrimental to Congregationalism. [...] In the Massachusetts General Court, the magistrates sought the death penalty, but the deputies were more sympathetic to free expression; they refused to agree, and the men were eventually released.|$|E
500|$|Hitler {{proved too}} impatient. He hoped to improve Germany's {{position}} by winning a decisive victory on the Western Front. Hitler distrusted Galland's theory and believed {{him to be}} afraid and stalling for time. The Führer was also skeptical that the Luftwaffe could stop the American air offensive and was not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> German resources sit idle on airfields to wait for an improvement in flying conditions. Admittedly Galland's efforts had built up a useful reserve, but Hitler was now {{to use it in}} support of a land offensive. Göring and Hitler handed over the forces pooled by Galland to Peltz whom they had appointed commander of II. Jagdkorps—responsible for virtually all fighter forces in the west. Peltz appointed Gordon Gollob as Special Fighter Staff Officer for the offensive. Gollob ultimately was a vociferous opponent of Galland and eventually engineered his dismissal. Whether the [...] "Big Blow" [...] operation would have worked is a matter of academic debate. Historians remained divided, with some believing it was a lost opportunity while others think it would have had much less impact than Galland estimated.|$|E
500|$|In 1918 Sir Thomas Acland {{granted to}} the National Trust a 500-year lease of {{a large part of}} the Holnicote Estate, {{including}} Dunkery Hill. Dunkery Hill was put up for sale in 1928.

She received the reply that although the government was agreeable to having the hill listed there were no funds available for its purchase; the beacon and surrounding mounds were subsequently designated an ancient monument.
