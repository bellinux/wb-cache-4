5|$|I {{have already}} made {{investigations}} {{about you and your}} people and I have verified your ability to make a deal. Now then, I am prepared to sell you one million Jews... Goods for blood– blood for goods. You can take them from any country you like, <b>wherever</b> you can find them– Hungary, Poland, the Ostmark, from Theresienstadt, from Auschwitz, <b>wherever</b> you like.|$|E

5|$|<b>Wherever</b> {{possible}} the concise first method is used. The following rules of thumb cover most cases.|$|E
5|$|<b>Wherever</b> we {{have had}} BNP {{problems}} in my area and when we have fought them hard, we've pulled back and won the seats back.|$|E
5|$|After seven years, Fripp and E.G. {{reached a}} {{settlement}} {{but the experience}} left Fripp determined {{to take control of}} his own work and financial affairs <b>wherever</b> possible. As part of this aim, he founded DisciplineGlobalMobile (DGM) as an independent musiclabel in 1992, as a fifty-fifty partnership with Singleton.|$|E
5|$|All {{activities}} {{were open to}} slaves {{with the exception of}} politics. For the Greeks, politics was the only activity worthy of a citizen, the rest being relegated <b>wherever</b> possible to non-citizens. It was status that was of importance, not activity.|$|E
5|$|All troops must {{engage the}} enemy <b>wherever</b> {{encountered}} and with every means at their disposal. Don't wait for direct orders from above, but act {{on your own}} and be guided by your judgement, initiative, and conscience.|$|E
5|$|Beetles {{are found}} in nearly all habitats, {{including}} freshwater and coastal habitats, <b>wherever</b> vegetative foliage is found, from trees and their bark to flowers, leaves, and underground near roots - even inside plants in galls, in every plant tissue, including dead or decaying ones.|$|E
5|$|By lending his {{prestige}} to Kennan's position, {{the president}} tacitly signaled {{his intention to}} formulate the strategy of his administration {{within the framework of}} its predecessor's, despite the misgivings of some within the Republican Party. The critical difference between the Truman and Eisenhower policies of containment had to do with Eisenhower's concerns that the United States could not indefinitely afford great military spending. The new president thus sought to minimize costs not by acting whenever and <b>wherever</b> the Soviets acted (a strategy designed to avoid risk) but rather whenever and <b>wherever</b> the United States could afford to act.|$|E
5|$|By the 4th century BCE Aristotle {{records that}} there were no {{restrictions}} on whom an heiress might marry. If she was not married during her father's lifetime or by directions in her father's will, her nearest next-of-kin was allowed to marry her <b>wherever</b> he chose.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} sections, <b>wherever</b> numeric equalities {{are shown in}} 'concise form'—such as —the two digits between the parentheses denote the uncertainty at 1σ standard deviation (68% confidence level) in the two least significant digits of the significand. A final X in a proposed definition denotes digits yet to be agreed on.|$|E
5|$|Logarithms {{also occur}} in {{log-normal}} distributions. When the logarithm of a random variable has a normal distribution, the variable {{is said to}} have a log-normal distribution. Log-normal distributions are encountered in many fields, <b>wherever</b> a variable is formed as the product of many independent positive random variables, for example in the study of turbulence.|$|E
5|$|Meetings of the Privy Council are {{normally}} held once each month <b>wherever</b> the sovereign {{may be in}} residence at the time. The quorum, according to the Privy Council Office, is three, though some statutes provide for other quorums (for example, section 35 of the Opticians Act 1989 provides for a lower quorum of two).|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{biologist}} Robin Holliday {{has written}} {{that the absence of}} biological wheels argues against creationist or intelligent design accounts of the diversity of life, because an intelligent creator—free of the limitations imposed by evolution—would be expected to deploy wheels <b>wherever</b> they would be of use.|$|E
5|$|Rockefeller became {{well known}} in his later life for the {{practice}} of giving dimes to adults and nickels to children <b>wherever</b> he went. He even gave dimes as a playful gesture to wealthy men, such as tire mogul Harvey Firestone.|$|E
5|$|The Ju 87 {{was fitted}} with {{detachable}} hatches and removable coverings to aid and ease maintenance and overhaul. The designers avoided welding parts <b>wherever</b> possible, preferring moulded and cast parts instead. Large airframe segments were interchangeable {{as a complete}} unit, which increased speed of repair.|$|E
5|$|<b>Wherever</b> Bissell went, he {{attracted}} attention, {{both from}} his fiery dancing and his habit of wearing {{a cowboy hat}} and boots around New York City—his way of distinguishing he was a true-blue native Texan. He also made {{his way around the}} city on a motorcycle.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} non-SI units {{that had never}} been {{formally}} sanctioned by the CGPM have continued to be used across the globe in many spheres including health care and navigation. As with the units of measure in Tables 6 and 7, these have been catalogued by the CIPM in the SI Brochure to ensure consistent usage, but with the recommendation that authors who use them should define them <b>wherever</b> they are used.|$|E
5|$|Because of his {{leadership}} at Yarmouk, Khalid ibn al-Walid {{is considered one}} of the finest generals in history and his use of mounted warriors throughout the battle showed just how well he understood the potential strengths and weaknesses of his mounted troops. His mobile guard moved quickly from one point to another, always changing the course of events <b>wherever</b> they appeared, and then just as quickly galloping away to change the course of events elsewhere on the field.|$|E
5|$|By {{the second}} half of the 20th century, {{developments}} in electronic media made possible the delivery of entertainment products to mass audiences across the globe. The technology enabled people to see, hear and participate in all the familiar forms stories, theatre, music, dance <b>wherever</b> they live. The rapid development of entertainment technology was assisted by improvements in data storage devices such as cassette tapes or compact discs, along with increasing miniaturisation. Computerisation and the development of barcodes also made ticketing easier, faster and global.|$|E
5|$|David E. Starkey and {{collaborators}} advanced a {{new view}} of the subspecies in 2003. Based on {{a study of the}} mitochondrial DNA, they rejected the glacial development theory and argued that the southern painted turtle should be elevated to a separate species, C. dorsalis, while the other subspecies should be collapsed into one and not differentiated. However, this proposition was largely unrecognized because successful breeding between all subspecies was documented <b>wherever</b> they overlapped. Nevertheless, in 2010, the IUCN recognized both C. dorsalis and C.p.dorsalis as valid names for the southern painted turtle.|$|E
5|$|Due to an {{increase}} of ridership, the MTA has tried to increase capacity <b>wherever</b> possible by adding more frequent service, specifically during the evening hours. However, this increase will not likely {{keep up with the}} growth of subway ridership. Some lines have capacity for additional trains during peak times, but there are too few subway cars for this additional service to be operated.|$|E
5|$|Founded in Spain in 1928 by the Catholic saint and priest Josemaría Escrivá, Opus Dei {{was given}} final Catholic Church {{approval}} in 1950 by Pope Pius XII. In 1982, by the apostolic constitution Ut sit, St. John Paul II {{made it a}} personal prelature—that is, the jurisdiction of its own bishop covers the persons in Opus Dei <b>wherever</b> they are, rather than geographical dioceses.|$|E
5|$|In general, ticks are to {{be found}} <b>wherever</b> their host species occur. Migrating birds carry ticks with them on their journeys; a study of migratory birds passing through Egypt found more than half the bird species {{examined}} were carrying ticks. The species of tick often differed between the autumn and spring migrations, probably because of the seasonal periodicities of the different species.|$|E
5|$|In {{recording}} Revelation, Third Day {{aimed to}} produce a southern rock album while being more creative musically; the band felt the end result was their best record to date. As a whole, the album is noted as adopting a heavier and edgier rock sound than Third Day's previous adult contemporary-projects such as <b>Wherever</b> You Are (2005), while the album's lyrics reflect Christian themes. The album features guest appearances from Chris Daughtry, Lacey Mosley of alternative metal band Flyleaf, and pedal steel guitarist Robert Randolph.|$|E
5|$|Keynes's {{economic}} thinking only {{began to}} achieve close to universal acceptance {{in the last}} few years of his life. On a personal level, Keynes's charm was such that he was generally well received <b>wherever</b> he went – even those who found themselves on the wrong side of his occasionally sharp tongue rarely bore a grudge. Keynes's speech at the closing of the Bretton Woods negotiations was received with a lasting standing ovation, rare in international relations, as the delegates acknowledged the scale of his achievements made despite poor health.|$|E
5|$|Late in the day, as the {{situation}} was becoming increasingly desperate throughout the country, Simović, who was both the Prime Minister and Yugoslav Chief of the General Staff, broadcast the following message:All troops must engage the enemy <b>wherever</b> encountered and with every means at their disposal. Don't wait for direct orders from above, but act on your own and be guided by your judgement, initiative, and conscience.|$|E
5|$|Lucretia and James Mott visited {{central and}} western New York {{in the summer}} of 1848 for a number of reasons, {{including}} visiting the Cattaraugus Reservation of the Seneca Nation and former slaves living in the province of Ontario, Canada. Mott was present at the meeting in which the Progressive Friends left the Hicksite Quakers. They also visited Lucretia's sister Martha Coffin Wright in Auburn, NY, where Mott also preached to prisoners at the Auburn State Penitentiary. Lucretia Mott's skill and fame as an orator drew crowds <b>wherever</b> she went.|$|E
5|$|Many {{residential}} PV {{systems are}} connected to the grid <b>wherever</b> available, especially in developed countries with large markets. In these grid-connected PV systems, use of energy storage is optional. In certain applications such as satellites, lighthouses, or in developing countries, batteries or additional power generators are often added as back-ups. Such stand-alone power systems permit operations at night and at other times of limited sunlight.|$|E
5|$|Metallica's first {{official}} tour was Kill 'Em All for One, {{which started in}} 1983 to promote their debut album. Their longest {{so far have been}} the <b>Wherever</b> We May Roam and World Magnetic Tours, which lasted 14 months and 20 months, respectively, with each having over 170 concerts. The band is among the most lucrative live bands, selling out half of their first 187 concerts held during the 2000s, and gaining an attendance of over 3.5 million people and a gross of over US$227 million.|$|E
5|$|Spain's {{worldwide}} {{military activities}} between the 14th and 17th centuries called for {{large numbers of}} horses, more than could be supplied by native Spanish mares. Spanish custom also called for mounted troops to ride stallions, never mares or geldings. Due to these factors, Spanish stallions were crossed with local mares in many countries, adding Spanish bloodlines <b>wherever</b> they went, especially to other European breeds.|$|E
5|$|Spotted hyenas {{dominate}} other hyena species <b>wherever</b> their ranges overlap. Brown hyenas encounter spotted hyenas in the Kalahari, {{where the}} brown species outnumbers the spotted. The two species typically encounter {{each other on}} carcasses, which the larger spotted species usually appropriate. Sometimes, brown hyenas will stand their ground and raise their manes while emitting growls. This usually {{has the effect of}} seemingly confusing spotted hyenas, which will act bewildered, though they will occasionally attack and maul their smaller cousins. Similar interactions have been recorded between spotted and striped hyenas in the Serengeti.|$|E
