25|$|The {{opinions}} of Nevada residents vary, {{but the majority}} appears to support the status quo of prostitution: they support laws allowing licensed brothels {{in the rural areas}} but oppose the legalization of prostitution in Las Vegas. A poll conducted in Nevada in 2002 found that 52% of the 600 respondents favored the existing legal and regulated brothels, while 31% were against laws that allow prostitution and the remainder were undecided, preferred fewer legal constraints on prostitution, or did not offer an opinion. The trend seems to be that new arrivals to Nevada tend to oppose legal prostitution while long-time Nevadans tend to support it. However, nearly 60% of Nevada residents oppose the legalization of brothels and prostitution in Las Vegas (59% oppose this idea, 35% support it and 6% don't know or didn't answer). Again, support is stronger in the rural areas (<b>where</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> were born in Nevada) and weaker in Clark County and Washoe County; women are more opposed to the idea than men.|$|E
25|$|The Outer Circle of English was {{produced}} by the second diaspora of English, which spread the language through imperial expansion by Great Britain in Asia and Africa. In these regions, English is not the native tongue, but serves as a useful lingua franca between ethnic and language groups. Higher education, the legislature and judiciary, national commerce and so on may all be carried out predominantly in English. This circle includes India, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Malaysia, Tanzania, Kenya, non-Anglophone South Africa, the Philippines (colonized by the US) and others. The total number of English speakers in the outer circle is estimated to range from 150 million to 300 million. Singapore, while in the Outer Circle, may be drifting into the Inner Circle as English becomes more often used as a home language (see Languages of Singapore), much as Ireland did earlier. Countries <b>where</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> speak an English-based creole and retain standard English for official purposes, such as Jamaica and Papua New Guinea, {{are also in the}} Outer Circle.|$|E

25|$|The {{newspaper}} struggled financially. In 1921 {{there were}} proposals to merge the newspaper into Demokraten. It was rejected {{for the time}} being, but a committee to work with this question was named in 1923. When {{it became clear that}} the Labour Party might be split in two, the board Østerdalens Arbeiderblad sympathized with the communist opposition, prompting Stubberud to resign and be replaced by acting editor Evald O. Solbakken. On 10 November 1923, after the Communist Party of Norway was founded and Arbeideren (the new name of Demokraten) aligned with that, a conference was held <b>where</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> agreed that Østerdalens Arbeiderblad should be discontinued and Arbeideren take over as organ for Østerdalen. On 11 November the tide turned completely as the supervisory council decided that Østerdalens Arbeiderblad should side with the Labour Party. Elverum Labour Party also decided to stay in the party instead of following the communists. Solbakken was fired, and Sæter returned. He remained so until 1932. Other acting editors during the newspaper's existence were Gerhard Iversen, Georg Svendsen and Johs. Borchgrevink.|$|E

The fastest prevalence increase is expected to occur in Asia and Africa, <b>where</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> with diabetes will probably live in 2030. The increase in rates in developing countries follows the trend of urbanization and lifestyle changes, including increasingly sedentary lifestyles, less physically demanding work and the global nutrition transition, marked by increased intake of foods that are high energy-dense but nutrient-poor (often high in sugar and saturated fats, {{sometimes referred to as}} the [...] "Western-style" [...] diet).|$|E

Children take up arms in their own defense and are often slain in battle or viciously tortured by the Glandelinian overlords. The elaborate mythology includes the setting of a large planet, around which Earth orbits as a moon (<b>where</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> are Christian and mostly Catholic), and a species called the [...] "Blengigomeneans" [...] (or Blengins for short), gigantic winged beings with curved horns who occasionally take human or part-human form, even disguising themselves as children.

As white Americans displaced Indians from the Indian Territory, both sides were eager for firearms. On the white side, both the U.S. Army and civilians were customers of Colt. The Army carried Colt revolvers through the last of its Indian Wars. On the Indian side, Colt weapons were captured when possible, or bought from whoever was selling. Even among whites in towns where Indians had been vanquished, a thriving demand for guns existed, from the criminals to the police to self-defending civilians.

2500|$|Reflecting {{the shift}} from the {{dominance}} of weekly youth comics to longer adult comics was the demise of Tintin {{and the start of}} A Suivre in 1978, the more adult oriented monthly magazine of publisher Casterman. It published longer [...] "chapters" [...] of the main European authors of graphic novels, with artists like Hugo Pratt and Jacques Tardi. Among them, room was still reserved for the best Walloon and Brussels' talents, including Didier Comès, Benoît Sokal, and François Schuiten. The magazine, seen as the more intellectual reply to French magazines like Métal Hurlant who were more oriented towards graphical innovation, was a big success and had a lot of influence, but turned out to be relatively short-lived. The Dutch language edition, started in 1980, folded in 1989 (the same year Poilote ceased publication), and in 1997 the French language edition disappeared as well, further demonstrating the demise of the magazine format in a market <b>where</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> prefer to immediately buy the albums.|$|E
2500|$|The Black Plague ravaged Europe {{during the}} 1340s-50s, wiping out {{almost half the}} continent's population. Particularly {{detrimental}} {{was the fact that}} most of the victims were young adults in their prime working years, which left behind an [...] "hourglass" [...] population structure comprised heavily of children and older people with fewer in-between. However, it should also be pointed out that the widespread belief of medieval Europe having a [...] "pyramid" [...] population <b>where</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> were under 45 was not completely true and in fact varied widely from region to region. France traditionally had high birth rates, but Italy's fertility was lower to begin with and especially after the Plague had ravaged the region, many cities such as Florence, Verona, and Arezzo had populations where more than 15% of people were over the age of 60. Since overall life expectancy in Europe did not increase by any significant margin during this period, the aging cohort in some areas can be almost completely blamed on the effects of the Plague. Finally, it should be pointed out that wealthy households had larger numbers of children than the poor. For example, in the early 15th century, the average age of Florence's population among the lower classes was 25 while the upper classes had an average age of just 17. The countryside became swiftly depopulated after the Plague as well due to surviving young people moving en masse to the cities.|$|E

Part of the success of the group coordinating named Direct Action was due to utilizing smart mob technologies including text messaging, Google Maps, live video-feeds and internet radio updates. In contrast to the first-day protests in 2003 when the city was effectively shut down in many ways, the protests were focussed on specific targets and conveying messages – [...] "there's little point in barricading the Bay Bridge in a city <b>where</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> are against the war anyway." [...] In the morning, a group of 500 worked their way through the morning commute effectively tying-up traffic for hours as the police had to block, move and re-block streets and busses for the procession. The Federal Reserve Bank and Chevron Corporation were also targeted with actions and saw arrests. Starting around noon and lasting for several hours the most [...] "dramatic" [...] protests were a die-in – again blocking the main traffic artery, Market Street – directly in front of California Senator Dianne Feinstein's office. Feinstein supported the Iraq war resolution and subsequent supplemental appropriations bills although she has stated she was deceived by the Bush administration about the weapons of mass destruction. As police arrested dozens of protesters more would take their place. In the evening 7000 marched and rallied in front of San Francisco City Hall hearing speeches including Assemblywoman Carole Migden.
