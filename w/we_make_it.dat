500|$|After {{he saw the}} {{completed}} episode, James L. Brooks called the writers and suggested that the Kamp Krusty script {{be used as a}} plotline for a film. However, the episode ran very short, and to make it barely fit the minimum time the Kamp Krusty song had to be lengthened by a number of verses. The episode was also chosen to be the first episode of the season, further complicating matters. As Jean told Brooks, [...] "First of all, if <b>we</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> into the movie then we don't have a premiere, and second, if we can't make 18 minutes out of this episode how are we supposed to make 80?" ...|$|E

Brooks suggested that the script for [...] "Kamp Krusty" [...] be expanded and produced as a feature-length theatrically released film. However, the episode ran very short, barely reaching the minimum length allowed, with the episode's musical number having to be lengthened by a number of verses. The episode had also been selected to be the season's premiere.

500|$|... "One Love" [...] is a R song, with {{a length}} of three minutes and fifty-four seconds (3:54). It was written by Lopez, along with A-Plus (Anesha Birchett and Antea Shelton) and the song's {{producer}} Emile [...] "D'Mile" [...] Dernst II. A-Plus (Birchett and Shelton) and D'Mile wrote and presented the song to Lopez, who loved the idea of it, but thought the track to be [...] "very generic". In response, she asked: [...] "Why don't <b>we</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> more 'me'?". Lopez then sat with them and wrote new verses for the song, going through every major relationship she had, asking the question: [...] "is there one love?". Lopez described the song as being about [...] "if we can ever have one true soul mate". She recorded her vocals for the song with Kuk Harrell at Record Plant Recording Studios, with additional vocal production from Josh Gudwin, Jim Annunziato and Birchett. John Kercy was responsible for Lopez's vocal editing on [...] "One Love", which was later mixed by Mike [...] "Handz" [...] Donaldson at Chalice Recording Studios.|$|E

500|$|The most {{interesting}} {{part of that}} {{for me is that}} audiences seem very unwilling to believe the stuff that Teddy [...] says at the end and yet why? I think its because people have spent the entire film looking at Leonard's photograph of Teddy, with the caption: [...] "Don't believe his lies." [...] That image really stays in people's heads, and they still prefer to trust that image even after <b>we</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> very clear that Leonard's visual recollection is completely questionable. It was quite surprising, and it wasn't planned. What was always planned was that we don't ever step completely outside Leonard's head, and that we keep the audience in that interpretive mode of trying to analyze what they want to believe or not. For me, the crux of the movie is that the one guy who might actually be the authority on the truth of what happened is played by Joe Pantoliano ... who is so untrustworthy, especially given the baggage he carries in from his other movies: he's already seen by audiences as this character actor who's always unreliable. I find it very frightening, really, the level of uncertainty and malevolence Joe brings to the film.|$|E

2500|$|Stack and the Union City {{police were}} {{the subject of}} {{controversy}} in July 2005 when {{it was discovered that}} Stack had received two campaign contributions totalling $3,500 from Luisa Medrano, a tavern owner indicted on 31 counts for running an illegal immigrant smuggling ring out of her two Bergenline Avenue taverns, [...] El Puerto de la Union II in Union City, and El Paisano Bar and Nightclub in Union City. Both taverns are no longer in operation. Medrano was accused of smuggling young women from Honduras, forcing them to work in bars for little money to pay off their smuggling debts, often incurring physical, emotional and sexual abuse during the operation. Stack responded by asserting that he does not accept contributions from bars and establishments, and explained that [...] " [...] used her name and address in Fairview. [...] <b>We</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> practice of not accepting donations from bar owners or establishments, and we do not accept cash." [...] Stack pointed out that Medrano's establishments were not mentioned on the form with which she made the donations, and that he decided to donate the money to the Battered Women's Shelter of Hudson County once the donations were revealed, claiming that in addition to not being aware of the source of the money, he was unaware of the illicit activities going on in the bars. Stack also defended the Union City Police, who are assigned to watch the taverns for quality of life reasons, and who incurred criticism for their apparent ignorance of the goings-on in the taverns, on the same basis, arguing that they only patrolled the streets, but did not enter the taverns when they did so, and thus, could not see what occurred in them.|$|E
