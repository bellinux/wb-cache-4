5000|$|The phylogenetic {{knowledge}} of Deinococcus ficus stems from its accidental discovery. After undergoing multiple rounds of phylogenetic analysis with 16S rRNA gene sequence, Deinococcus ficus CC-FR2-10T {{was placed in}} the genus Deinococcus due to similarities in resistance of UV-light, gamma radiation, and desiccation. Deinococcus ficus has a number of close relatives including D. grandis <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 96.1% <b>similar</b> 16S rRNA gene sequence, D. radiodurans <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 94.3% <b>similar</b> 16S rRNA gene sequence, D. radiopugnans <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 93.2% <b>similar</b> 16S rRNA gene sequence, D. indicus <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 93.0% <b>similar</b> 16S rRNA gene sequence, D. proteolyticus <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 92.5% <b>similar</b> 16S rRNA gene sequence, D. murrayi <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 92.4% <b>similar</b> 16S rRNA gene sequence, and D. geothermal is <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 90.7% <b>similar</b> 16S rRNA gene sequence to that of D. ficus. [...] As observed through high-performance liquid chromatography, D. ficus is further related to its fellow members of the Deinococcus genus through their mutual utilization of menaquinone (MK-8), a related compound of vitamin K2 found in fermented foods, as their major quinone.|$|R

5|$|An astronomical text {{recovered}} from Tomb no.3 in Mawangdui contains images {{and descriptions of}} 29 different comets. The descriptions often include the comet's name, notes about its apparition, and its associated portent, usually military, but lack detailed dates of the comets' sightings. This text can be solidly dated as being prior to 168 BC, the date assigned to the tomb.

5|$|At {{the dawn}} of the Grand Lodge era, during the 1720s, James Anderson {{composed}} the first printed constitutions for Freemasons, the basis for most subsequent constitutions, which specifically excluded women from Freemasonry. As Freemasonry spread, continental masons began to include their ladies in Lodges of Adoption, which worked three degrees with the same names as the men's but different content. The French officially abandoned the experiment in the early 19th century. Later organisations <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> aim emerged in the United States, but distinguished the names of the degrees from those of male masonry.|$|E
