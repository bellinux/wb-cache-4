In other words, it is that rare occasion when a politician inadvertently says what he or she really means but would rather the general public not know it. In modern times a gaffe calls for immediate damage control to “walk back ” the statement which was “misspoke. ” One might even acknowledge “a mistake was made ” (note the passive voice) or even {{go so far as to}} “take responsibility ” as long as no consequences are attached.

The speech was just a month before the firing on Fort Sumter after which an additional four states joined the CSA. In the 1840 s Stephens was a US Congressman from Georgia. He was on friendly terms with his fellow Whig Party member, Abra-ham Lincoln. They both strongly opposed the Mexican-American War.

How sensitive is the answer to the assumption of the trade model? We find a striking answer to these questions. We find that, for a very broad class of models and settings, the global welfare impact of trade liberalization in a country, or a simultaneous liberalization of a number of countries, is given by the same simple formula. We find that the global welfare impact of the simultaneous trade liberalization of different countries only depends on two sets of statistics: (i) the ratio of the value of bilateral trade between each and every pair of trading partners and global income; and (ii) the change in exporting cost for each and every pair of trading partners. Most interestingly, the formula applies to a very broad class of models and settings, which include the general Ricardian model (including, for example, Anderson, 1979, and Eaton and Kortum, 2002), the models of Krugman (1980), Melitz (2003) and its extensions, and the extensions of these models to the multi-sectoral case, multi-factor production technology, multi-stage production, the existence of tradable intermediate goods and the existence of a large outside good sector in each country.
