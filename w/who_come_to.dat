5|$|Bryant's career did not recover. She {{attempted}} to stage comebacks in Eureka Springs, Arkansas in 1992, Branson, Missouri in 1994 ("People <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> my performances {{are hungry for}} the truth. They thank me for reminding them {{of the importance of}} God and country."), and Pigeon Forge, Tennessee in 1997. However, at each venue her audiences dwindled and investors were non-existent. By 2002, Bryant and her second husband Charlie Dry had claimed bankruptcy in three states. As of 2006 Bryant was living in Oklahoma City.|$|E

5|$|Kingdom is a British {{television}} series produced by Parallel Film and Television Productions for the ITV network.

The series also starred Hermione Norris, Celia Imrie, Karl Davies, Phyllida Law and Tony Slattery.|$|E

The College Football Hall of Fame was moved from Kings Mills, Ohio, to downtown South Bend in 1995, though the Hall of Fame relocated to Atlanta, Georgia in 2014.|$|E

5|$|During the Cultural Revolution, Red Guards {{attacked}} the Jokhang in 1966 {{and for a}} decade there was no worship in Tibetan monasteries. Renovation of the Jokhang began in 1972, and was mostly complete by 1980. After this {{and the end of}} persecution, the temple was re-consecrated. It is now visited by a large number of Tibetans, <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> worship Jowo in the temple's inner sanctum. During the Revolution, the temple was spared destruction and was reportedly boarded up until 1979. At that time, portions of the Jokhang reportedly housed pigs, a slaughterhouse and Chinese army barracks. Soldiers burned historic Tibetan scriptures. For a time, it was a hotel.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, the scholar-turned-bureaucrat Guo Moruo {{laid out}} the first modern {{proposal}} to repair the Great Wall. Five years later, the renovated Badaling became the first section to be {{opened to the public}} since the establishment of the PRC. The Badaling Great Wall has since become a staple stop for foreign dignitaries <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> China, beginning with Nepali prime minister Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala in 1960, and most notably the American president Richard Nixon in his historic 1972 visit to China. To date, Badaling is still the most visited stretch of the Great Wall.|$|E
5|$|The many {{visitors}} <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> birdwatch, sail or for other outdoor recreations {{are important to}} the local economy, but the land-based activities jeopardize nesting birds and fragile habitats, especially the dunes. Some access restrictions on humans and dogs help to reduce the adverse effects, and trips to see the seals are usually undertaken by boat. The spit is a dynamic structure, gradually moving towards the coast and extending to the west. Land is lost to the sea as the spit rolls forward. The River Glaven can become blocked by the advancing shingle and cause flooding of Cley village, Cley Marshes nature reserve, and the environmentally important reclaimed grazing pastures, so the river has to be realigned every few decades.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, {{the village}} of Carabane's {{official}} population count stood at 396 people and 55 households, but it fluctuates with the seasons and sometimes reaches some 1,750 people, according to local sources. Most {{of the population is}} Jola. The Jola are very distinct from other major ethnic groups in Senegal by their language, egalitarian society, freedom from political hierarchy, and lack of slavery. Their traditions have persevered because of their independent spirit as well as their geographical isolation. This ethnic group accounts for 80 to 90% of the residents of Basse Casamance, but only 6 to 8% of the total population of Senegal. They are the largest ethnic group in Carabane, followed by Wolofs, Lebous, and Serers (including Niominka fishermen). Manjacks also live on the island, some of whom came from Saint-Louis and Gorée {{at the time of the}} first colonization. Two communities from neighbouring countries, one from Guinea (the Susu people) and the other from Guinea-Bissau, have settled on the other side of the island at a distance from the village. There are also seasonal workers <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> fish: Ghanaians, Guineans, and Gambians.|$|E
5|$|Spirit Splash occurs the Friday {{before the}} Homecoming game, {{and serves as}} a pep rally where {{students}} descend into the pond to demonstrate school spirit. Spirit Splash began in 1995 when then-Student Body President Miguel Torregrossa was pushed into the Reflecting Pond by one of his cabinet members and fellow students followed suit. Along with the thousands of students who attend, there are members of the community, local dignitaries, alumni, children and even dogs <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> join in on the festivities. Knightro, the Marching Knights, cheerleaders, student athletes, and dancers all participate in the pep rally, usually followed by a concert. Spirit Splash was made possible in part by weight testing performed on the Reflecting Pond in preparation for President Richard Nixon's visit to the university to speak at its 1973 commencement. It was determined {{that the best way to}} protect the president would be to hold commencement in the pond itself, after being drained, so that Secret Service agents could be stationed on the roofs of the adjacent buildings.|$|E
5|$|The School of International and Public Affairs extends {{invitations to}} {{heads of state}} and heads of {{government}} <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> New York City {{for the opening of}} the fall session of the United Nations General Assembly. In 2007, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was one of those invited to speak on campus. Ahmadinejad accepted his invitation and spoke on September 24, 2007, as part of Columbia University's World Leaders Forum. The invitation proved to be highly controversial. Hundreds of demonstrators swarmed the campus on September 24 and the speech itself was televised worldwide. University President Lee C. Bollinger tried to allay the controversy by letting Ahmadenijad speak, but with a negative introduction (given personally by Bollinger). This did not mollify those who were displeased {{with the fact that the}} Iranian leader had been invited onto the campus. Columbia students, though, turned out en masse to listen to the speech on the South Lawn. An estimated 2,500 undergraduates and graduates came out for the historic occasion.|$|E

5|$|The hotel, {{which today}} has 159 rooms, {{was founded in}} 1898 by the Swiss hotelier, César Ritz, in {{collaboration}} with the French chef, Auguste Escoffier. The new hotel was constructed behind the façade of an 18th-century town house, overlooking one of Paris's central squares. It was among the first hotels in Europe to provide a bathroom en suite, a telephone and electricity for each room. It quickly established a reputation for luxury, with clients including royalty, politicians, writers, film stars and singers. Several of its suites are named in honour of famous guests of the hotel, including Coco Chanel and Ernest Hemingway, who lived at the hotel for years. One of the bars of the hotel, Bar Hemingway, is devoted to Hemingway. L'Espadon is a world-renowned restaurant, attracting aspiring chefs {{from all over the world}} <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> learn at the adjacent Ritz-Escoffier School. The grandest suite of the hotel, called the Suite Impériale, has been listed by the French government as a national monument in its own right.|$|E
5|$|Other scriptures {{describe}} other {{visits by}} Shiva to Deodar Forest in his Bhikshatana form. The Vamana Purana mentions Shiva entering the Deodar Forest twice as a beggar. Maddened {{by the death}} of his first wife Sati but chased by the love-god Kamadeva, Shiva escapes to the Deodar Forest and lives as a mendicant. The sages' wives <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> grant him food become sexually excited at the mere sight of him. The sages curse his Linga to fall off and it becomes the infinite pillar. Brahma and Vishnu propitiate him and Shiva reabsorbs the Linga into his body. In another instance, while passing the Deodar Forest, Parvati notices sages who worship Shiva and have emaciated their bodies with fasts and severe vows. Parvati requests Shiva to save them from further pain, but Shiva declares that the sages are simply foolish and have not restrained their passion and anger. He enters the forest as a handsome man, wearing only a garland of sylvan flowers. He entices the sages' wives, who give him alms. As before, the Linga of the cursed Shiva falls off, but eventually the sages realise their folly and worship the Linga. Similar accounts of Bhikshatana-Shiva's visit to the Deodar Forest to humble and enlighten the false sages, Bhikshatana-Shiva's emasculation and establishment of Linga worship also appear in the Mahabharata, the Shiva Purana, and the Bhagavata Purana.|$|E
