2500|$|The idea {{of using}} an initial {{property}} {{is to set up}} the problem in terms of some auxiliary category E, and then identify that what we want is to find an initial object of E. [...] This has an advantage that the optimization—the sense that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>finding</b> the most efficient solution—means something rigorous and is recognisable, rather like the attainment of a supremum. [...] The category E is also formulaic in this construction, since it is always the category of elements of the functor to which one is constructing an adjoint. In fact, this latter category is precisely the comma category over the functor in question.|$|E

Consultant: PhDr. Ladislav Janovec, Ph. D. The {{objective}} of this thesis is to describe communication at conservatoires and its specific features. We applied the pedagogical, linguistic, and marginally also the musicological approach. The educational communication was described based on partial objectives. The first research part deals with research and description of communication structures where <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>finding</b> out what types of communication structures occur in the educational communication and what communication structures are represented the most. The second research part deals with research and description of communication (illocutionary) functions where <b>we</b> <b>were</b> interested in with what intents the teachers and pupils communicate and in what frequency. The third research part deals with humour in the educational communication. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>finding</b> out what humour situations occur in the educational communication, i. e. what and why the teachers and pupils laugh at, who initiates the humour, who laughs at it, {{as to whether the}} humour is intentional or not, as to whether it is connected with the content of the [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{implications for}} urban neighborhoods of two dramatic {{shifts in the}} American educational landscape: (1) the rapid disappearance of Catholic schools from urban neighborhoods, and (2) the rise of charter schools. In previous studies, we linked Catholic school closures to increased disorder and crime, and decreased social cohesion, in Chicago neighborhoods. This paper turns to two questions unanswered in our previous investigations. First, because we focused exclusively on school closures in our previous studies, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> uncertain whether our results reflected the work that open Catholic schools do as neighborhood institutions or whether <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>finding</b> a “loss effect. ” Second, since we have thus far focused on one type of educational institution, we could not say whether <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>finding</b> “school effects” generally, or “Catholic school effects” in particular. In this paper, we begin to answer both questions by comparing the effects of open Catholic and charter schools on neighborhood crime rates. Relying on police-beat-level data, we find that that police beats with open Catholic schools have lower rates of serious crime than those without one. Usually, a charter appears to have no statistically significant effect on crime rates. Our <b>findings</b> <b>are</b> important {{for a number of}} related reasons discussed in the paper...|$|R
2500|$|While {{the bulk}} of {{material}} in any star is hydrogen and helium, {{there is a significant}} variation in the amount of heavier elements (metals). A high proportion of metals in a star correlates to the amount of heavy material initially available in the protoplanetary disk. A smaller amount of metal makes the formation of planets much less likely, under the solar nebula theory of planetary system formation. Any planets that did form around a metal-poor star would probably be low in mass, and thus unfavorable for life. Spectroscopic studies of systems where exoplanets have been found to date confirm the relationship between high metal content and planet formation: [...] "Stars with planets, or at least with planets similar to the ones <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>finding</b> today, are clearly more metal rich than stars without planetary companions." [...] This relationship between high metallicity and planet formation also means that habitable systems {{are more likely to be}} found around stars of younger generations, since stars that formed early in the universe's history have low metal content.|$|E

6000|$|Thus, then, {{we are on}} {{the highway}} towards the {{doctrine}} long ago enunciated by Pestalozzi, that alike in its order and its methods, education must conform to the natural process of mental evolution--that there is a certain sequence in which the faculties spontaneously develop, and a certain kind of knowledge which each requires during its development; and that it is for us to ascertain this sequence, and supply this knowledge. All the improvements above alluded to are partial applications of this general principle. A nebulous perception of it now prevails among teachers; and it is daily more insisted on in educational works. [...] "The method of nature is the archetype of all methods," [...] says M. Marcel. [...] "The vital principle in the pursuit is to enable the pupil rightly to instruct himself," [...] writes Mr. Wyse. The more science familiarises us with the constitution of things, the more do we see in them an inherent self-sufficingness. A higher knowledge tends continually to limit our interference with the processes of life. As in medicine the old [...] "heroic treatment" [...] has given place to mild treatment, and often no treatment save a normal regimen--as we have found that it is not needful to mould the bodies of babes by bandaging them in papoose-fashion or otherwise--as in gaols it is being discovered that no cunningly-devised discipline of ours is so efficient in producing reformation as the natural discipline of self-maintenance by productive labour; so in education, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>finding</b> that success is to be achieved only by making our measures subservient to that spontaneous unfolding which all minds go through in their progress to maturity.|$|E

60|$|There is {{one thing}} he can not avoid; go where he will about the world, he must never fail to report in Jerusalem every fiftieth year. Only {{a year or two}} ago he was here for the thirty-seventh time since Jesus was crucified on Calvary. They say that many old people, who are here now, saw him then, and had seen him before. He looks always the same--old, and withered, and hollow-eyed, and listless, save that there is about him {{something}} which seems to suggest that he is looking for some one, expecting some one--the friends of his youth, perhaps. But the most of them are dead, now. He always pokes about the old streets looking lonesome, making his mark on a wall here and there, and eyeing the oldest buildings with a sort of friendly half interest; and he sheds a few tears at the threshold of his ancient dwelling, and bitter, bitter tears they are. Then he collects his rent and leaves again. He has been seen standing near the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on many a starlight night, for he has cherished an idea for many centuries that if he could only enter there, he could rest. But when he approaches, the doors slam to with a crash, the earth trembles, and all the lights in Jerusalem burn a ghastly blue! He does this every fifty years, just the same. It is hopeless, but then it is hard to break habits one has been eighteen hundred years accustomed to. The old tourist is far away on his wanderings, now. How he must smile to see a pack of blockheads like us, galloping about the world, and looking wise, and imagining <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>finding</b> out a good deal about it!

60|$|Let me refer {{again to}} that word that I used; death--the amount of death. I really {{believe there are}} {{hundreds}} of good and kind people who would take up this subject with their whole heart and soul if they were aware of the magnitude of the evil. Lord Shaftesbury told you just now that there were one hundred thousand preventable deaths in England every year. So it is. We talk of the loss of human life in war. We are the fools of smoke and noise; because there are cannon-balls, forsooth, and swords and red coats; and because it costs a great deal of money, and makes a great deal of talk in the papers, we think: What so terrible as war? I will tell you what is ten times, and ten thousand times, more terrible than war, and that is outraged Nature. War, we are discovering now, is the clumsiest and most expensive of all games; <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>finding</b> that if you wish to commit an act of cruelty and folly, the most costly one that you can commit is to contrive to shoot your fellow-men in war. So it is; and thank God that so it is; but Nature, insidious, inexpensive, silent, sends no roar of cannon, no glitter of arms to do her work; she gives no warning note of preparation; she has no protocols, nor any diplomatic advances, whereby she warns her enemy that war is coming. Silently, I say, and insidiously she goes forth; no! she does not even go forth; she does not step out of her path; but quietly, by the very same means by which she makes alive, she puts to death; and so avenges herself of those who have rebelled against her. By the very same laws by which every blade of grass grows, and every insect springs to life in the sunbeam, she kills, and kills, and kills, and is never tired of killing; till she has taught man the terrible lesson he is so slow to learn, that, Nature is only conquered by obeying her.|$|E
