If you look at the assassinations in this country in the 1960s you can certainly see how it affected history in a very profound way. So if you killed right wing figures, you'd also be altering the course of history, and eliminating people who might very well be president in 1996 and those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>making</b> bashing gays their number one issue right now. On the one hand, I'm not advocating PWA's turn themselves into human bombs, {{but on the other hand}} I have to admit that if I clicked on CNN and heard somebody had blown Patrick Buchanan's head clean off, I'd be elated, and to say otherwise would be a lie.|$|E

However, there are applications in which the hobbyist can benefit from the range of fasteners that are available. They are easier and require less skill to install than some of the other more traditional techniques.|$|E

25|$|Kirkby's shows set a {{standard}} that was upheld for many years by himself and his successors. In one of his shows (in 1915) was Harry Hudson and their association with its mix of songs and humour resulted in a partnership that gained great popularity as a music-hall act in the 1920s. In 1916 The Stage magazine gave the following review of an early concert resulting from their collaboration:Popular newcomers to the bill this week are Stanley Kirkby and Harry Hudson <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>making</b> their first appearance in the West End in a double turn.

Virginia Heffernan from The New York Times called the video heart-pounding, and compared its momentum with the music video of [...] "Thriller, [...] "In the Air Tonight" [...] and [...] "Shadows of the Night". However, Eric Wilson from the same newspaper commented that the video did not yield a breakout Madonna look compared to her videos from the 1980s. Singer Miley Cyrus created her {{own version of the}} video and posted it on her YouTube channel. Madonna responded to it in her own video and said, [...] "All you people out there <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>making</b> videos to my new single, '4 Minutes,' keep up the good work, nice job."

500|$|Madonna {{released}} her eighth studio album, Music, in September 2000. It featured elements from the electronica-inspired Ray of Light era, and like its predecessor, received acclaim from critics. Collaborating with French producer Mirwais Ahmadzaï, Madonna commented: [...] "I love {{to work with}} the weirdos that no one knows about—the people who have raw talent and <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>making</b> music unlike anyone else out there. Music is the future of sound." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic felt that [...] "Music blows by in a kaleidoscopic rush of color, technique, style and substance. It has so many depth and layers that it's easily as self-aware and earnest as Ray of Light." [...] The album took the number-one position in more than 20 countries worldwide and sold four million copies in the first ten days. In the U.S., Music debuted at the top, and became her first number-one album in eleven years since Like a Prayer. It produced three singles: the Hot 100 number-one [...] "Music", [...] "Don't Tell Me", and [...] "What It Feels Like for a Girl". The music video of [...] "What It Feels Like for a Girl" [...] depicted Madonna committing acts of crime and vandalism, and was banned by MTV and VH1.|$|E
500|$|When President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva {{took office}} in January 2003, he chose Gil as Brazil's new Minister of Culture, only the second black person {{to serve in the}} country's cabinet. The {{appointment}} was controversial among political and artistic figures and the Brazilian press; a remark Gil made about difficulties with his salary received particular criticism. Gil is not a member of Lula's Workers' Party and did not participate in creating its cultural program. Shortly after becoming Minister, Gil began a partnership between Brazil and Creative Commons. As Minister, he has sponsored a program called Culture Points, which gives grants to provide music technology and education to people living in poor areas of the country's cities. Gil has since asserted that [...] "You've now got young people who are becoming designers, <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>making</b> it into media and being used more and more by television and samba schools and revitalizing degraded neighborhoods. It's a different vision of the role of government, a new role." [...] Gil has also expressed interest in a program that will establish an Internet repository of freely downloadable Brazilian music. Since Gil's appointment, the department's expenditures have increased by over 50percent. In November 2007 Gil announced his intention to resign from his post due to a vocal cord polyp. Lula rejected Gil's first two attempts to resign, but accepted another request in July 2008. Lula said on this occasion that Gil was [...] "going back to being a great artist, going back to giving priority to what is most important" [...] to him.|$|E

2500|$|Despite their simplicity, the GROW {{games have}} {{received}} largely favorable reviews. PC Gamers Jaz McDougall described the spare cartoon visuals as productive of a surreal playing experience {{and suggested that}} some of the more complex titles in the series could benefit from group playing by multiple players. Rock, Paper, Shotgun's Alec Meer describes the series as [...] "endearing" [...] and [...] "dreamlike", while The Guardians Naomi Alderman described them as [...] "enchanting", [...] "whimsical" [...] and child-friendly.

2500|$|Shikharbaddha mandir {{complexes}} also encompass numerous associated structures. [...] Sadhus {{serving in}} the temple typically reside in residence halls within the compounds. [...] A striking feature of the Swaminarayan temples are the guest houses (dharmashalas) which are provided for visitors.

Food and lodging are provided for individuals or families who wish to make {{a visit to the}} temple on their travels or <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>making</b> a religious pilgrimage to visit the main temples. Provision is made for large numbers of persons who come to the temples for festivals lasting several days. No charge is made for the accommodation; nevertheless, most visitors make a donation. Small temples may have only two or three guest rooms, but larger shikharbaddha mandirs have several buildings with the capacity to house hundreds of pilgrims. The BAPS temple in Amdavad constructed an eight-story dharmashala that houses a modern medical facility on the ground floor where pilgrims can obtain a complete physical examination.
