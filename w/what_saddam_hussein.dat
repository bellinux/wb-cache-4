[...] "People are looking at the song in context of an attack on America, as opposed to an attack on Tony Blair. And really, my attack is that Tony Blair is not involving the British in this issue. He's perfectly happy staying up to watch the World Cup and enjoying the Jubilee, all things I'm perfectly guilty of, but there's a serious discussion about Iraq, which hasn't taken place. We don't know <b>what</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> is capable of, the British public has no idea." ...|$|E
5000|$|Yeates's first novel, Bay of One Hundred Fires (...) , {{published}} in 2004, is an alternate history based geo-political thriller that speculates <b>what</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> {{might have done}} with the deadly weapons many people believed he had. In the novel, the nuclear-powered USS California is overhauled and upgraded, and {{plays a key role}} in fighting Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein who has, at least in the book, created a stockpile of weapons of mass destruction. Some of Yeates's inspiration for Bay came from his service in the U.S. Navy, where he served and developed expertise in 3-D radar aboard the California in 1974. When the California was delivered to the U.S. Navy, Yeates was at the helm when the ship departed the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company for its maiden voyage at sea. Yeates also helmed the California in 1998 when it sailed to the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard to be scrapped.|$|E
