25|$|Dan Patch next {{tackled the}} record for one mile on a half-mile track. Because the horse must {{negotiate}} more and tighter turns on a smaller track, the half-mile track record is slower than the time on a one-mile track. Even today, separate records are kept in harness racing depending on the track dimensions. On September 7 at the half-mile track in Lima, Ohio, Dan Patch paced a world record of 2:04, {{only to have the}} record broken by Prince Alert a few weeks later. Prince Alert then lowered the world record on a one-mile track to an astonishing 1:57, thanks in part to perfect weather conditions but also aided by a large canvas sail carried between the galloping horses who set the pace. Critics pointed out that the sail, later referred to as a <b>wind</b> <b>shield,</b> lessened the wind resistance that a horse faced (similar to drafting in cycling or motor racing). Although the usage of wind shields was eventually disallowed by the American Trotting Register, in the short term it meant that Dan Patch was no longer the fastest horse in the world.|$|E
2500|$|Dan Patch {{responded to}} the {{challenge}} by setting a flurry of records. In Lexington, he broke the existing record for pacing while attached to a wagon, instead of the lighter, more aerodynamic sulky, by over two seconds. A week later in Memphis, he regained the one mile world from Prince Alert {{with a time of}} 1:56, an accomplishment that made the first page of the New York Times. Dan Patch maintained a steady pace, completing the first quarter mile in 29 seconds, the first half in 58 seconds and the three-quarters in 1:37. McHenry had used used only a small canvas strip between the wheels of his pacemaker's sulky that McHenry called a dust shield, compared to the much larger <b>wind</b> <b>shield</b> carried between two pacemakers used by Prince Alert.|$|E

40|$|Plastic {{increases}} in stem elongation in dense vegetation are generally {{believed to be}} induced by canopy shading, but because plants protect each other from <b>wind,</b> <b>shielding</b> (reduced mechanical stress) could also play a role. To address this issue, tobacco Nicotiana tabacum plants were subjected to two levels of mechanical stress, 0 (control) or 40 (flexed) daily flexures, and grown solitarily, in a dense monostand (with plants of only one mechanical treatment), or in a mixed stand (flexed and control plants grown together). Flexed plants produced shorter and thicker stems with a lower Young's modulus than control plants, while dense-stand plants had relatively taller and thinner stems than solitary ones. Flexing effects on stem characteristics were independent of stand density. Growth, reproduction, and survival of solitary plants were not affected by flexing, while in the monostand growth was slightly reduced. But in the mixed stand, flexed plants were readily shaded by controls and had considerably lower growth, survival, and reproduction rates. These results suggest that <b>wind</b> <b>shielding</b> indeed {{plays a role in}} the plastic increase in stem elongation of plants in dense vegetation and that this response can have important consequences for competitive ability and lifetime seed production...|$|R

50|$|The {{olfactory}} navigation hypothesis {{states that}} pigeons learn an odour map by associating smells perceived {{at the home}} loft with the directions from which they are carried by winds. Therefore, attempts to manipulate the development of that have involved changing the direction of <b>wind,</b> <b>shielding</b> birds from <b>winds</b> of a certain direction and exposing the pigeons to artificial odorants. The predication is that the experimental pigeons should learn an altered map and thus when released, they should fly according to their distorted perception.|$|R
50|$|Fractional {{horsepower}} motors {{are used}} {{across a wide}} range of industries and applications for a variety of motion and compression needs.

50|$|There {{is also a}} Mini Trangia. It was {{specially}} {{produced for}} the multi-sport competition KIMM (Karrimor International Mountain Marathon).

The entire package weighs just 330 grams, according to Trangia's website. The Mini Trangia is much more portable than the standard-sized Trangia and is even lighter than most liquid-fuelled, pressure stoves (which don't include pots or pans in the weight).

50|$|The new {{bridge is}} a {{cable-stayed}} structure, with three towers each 207 m high.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of natural night-ventilation {{in the urban}} environment depends on local climate char- acteristics, but also on solar shading and <b>wind</b> <b>shielding</b> effects of the surrounding buildings. However, {{the impact of the}} latter factors on the {{effectiveness of}} night-ventilation is often disregarded, altering the predicted building energy performance. Building Energy Simulation tools coupled with Airﬂow Net- work models allow estimating the effect of the urban environment on the cooling energy savings due to night-ventilation. Nevertheless, external sources of wind ﬂow data are needed to account for the <b>wind</b> <b>shielding</b> effect of surrounding buildings. In this paper, the cooling effectiveness of night-ventilation for an ofﬁce building placed in the center of urban areas of increased density is analyzed for three European locations. The energy demand of the unventilated building is ﬁrst assessed, also considering the effect of environmental albedo and a simpliﬁed Urban Heat Island scenario. Then, night-ventilation rates and energy savings for the ventilated building are calculated to estimate the variation of the cooling effect of night-ventilation. Results show a strong reduction of the energy savings in high-density urban areas and point out that {{a detailed description of the}} surroundings is crucial to assess the suitability of passive cooling solutions...|$|R

50|$|Three {{days after}} the {{commercial}} release of Innervisions, on August 6, 1973, Wonder played a concert in Greenville, South Carolina. While on the way back, just outside Durham, North Carolina, Wonder was asleep {{in the front seat}} of a car being driven by his friend, John Harris, when they were snaking along the road, behind a truck loaded high with logs. Suddenly the trucker jammed on his brakes, and the two vehicles collided. Logs went flying, and one smashed through the <b>wind</b> <b>shield,</b> sailing squarely into Stevie Wonder's forehead. He was bloody and unconscious when he was pulled from the wrecked car. For four days he lay in a coma caused by severe brain contusion, causing media attention and the preoccupation of relatives, friends and fans.|$|E

5000|$|Lip-ribbon {{microphones}} use baffles {{to create}} an acoustic labyrinth within {{the body of the}} microphone. The microphone's bi-directional polar pattern controls interference; sound from the commentator reaches one side of the ribbon more than the other, whereas sounds from other sources contact both sides of the ribbon (at a difference in phase of 180°) and cancel out. [...] The labyrinth design also allows lip-ribbon microphones to withstand wind speeds of up to 20 mph without affecting speech. This resistance can be further strengthened with the use of <b>wind</b> <b>shields.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{description}} of the aerodynamic cross-wind effect that occurs on a long vehicle, when it crosses {{the wake of a}} bridge tower will be analyzed both considering and neglecting the adoption of wind barriers close to tower. Wind tunnel tests are used to measure the aerodynamic loads and the surface pressure distribution on a 1 : 40 scale model.
