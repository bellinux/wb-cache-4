5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration noted the drug <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>used</b> recreationally in California. It also {{reported}} that BZP <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>used</b> as an adulterant in illicit drugs. Not long after, {{there was an explosion}} in the drug's use worldwide – a situation which was soon followed by legislative control in many countries. Since 1999, benzylpiperazine use grew sharply in New Zealand due to an initial complete lack of regulation. The New Zealand government attempted to ban the product as of 18 December 2007, but the necessary second reading of the bill did not happen in time for the law to be passed. It was so widely used that an estimated 5 million pills were sold in New Zealand in 2007.|$|E

5|$|Although King Charles's Castle <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>used</b> {{to house}} {{soldiers}} in 1660, by the 18th century it {{was described as}} ruinous.

5|$|Edward was {{determined}} to prevent any further rebellion in North Wales and set about building a sequence of new castles and walled towns, replacing the old Welsh administrative system with a new principality governed from Caernarfon. Dolbadarn was no longer relevant and within two years timber from the castle <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>used</b> by the Normans {{for the construction of}} Caernarfon Castle. This was both a practical and a symbolic action, demonstrating Norman power over {{one of the most important}} possessions of the Welsh princes.|$|E
5|$|For its United States release, {{the film}} was {{originally}} scheduled to be released on November 25, 2015, but 20th Century Fox switched The Martian with Victor Frankenstein, so the former would be its first film for all audiences in the country's Autumn season (September–November). On the film's 3D screenings, RealD's chief Anthony Marcoly said 3D technology was proliferating from action-packed blockbuster films commonly released in the United States' summer season. Marcoly said the technology <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>used</b> in more immersive storytelling, citing The Martian and The Walk (released the same year) as two examples.|$|E

5|$|In the 18th century onwards {{the town}} walls were often adapted for new uses or simply demolished. As early as 1641, the chapel above East Gate had been leased out to private tenants.
