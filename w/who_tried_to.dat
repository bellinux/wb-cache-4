5|$|The {{cause of}} the fire could not be {{determined}} with certainty. One possibility is that a fire smouldered in the furniture store Inden under the hotel, {{and the opening of}} the elevator shaft in the morning provided an inflow of oxygen, causing the fire to spread. There is also a theory that the fire was set by burglars <b>who</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> cover their tracks; however, {{there was no evidence of}} a burglary.|$|E

5|$|W. Somerset Maugham (1874– 1965) was a British playwright, {{novelist and}} short story writer.

He was raised by an uncle, <b>who</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> persuade the youngster to become an {{accountant}} or parson; Maugham instead trained as a doctor, although he never practised professionally, as his first novel, Liza of Lambeth, was published the same year he qualified.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the medieval}} chronicler Geoffrey Gaimar, after the Battle of Stamford Bridge Harold {{entrusted}} the loot gained from Harold Hardrada to Ealdred. Gaimar asserts that King Harold did {{this because he}} had heard of Duke William's landing in England, and needed to rush south to counter it. After the Battle of Hastings, Ealdred joined the group <b>who</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> elevate Edgar the Ætheling, Edward the Exile's son, as king, but eventually he submitted to William the Conqueror at Berkhamsted. John of Worcester says that the group supporting Edgar vacillated {{over what to do}} while William ravaged the countryside, which led to Ealdred and Edgar's submission to William.|$|E
5|$|After being marched {{two miles}} north-west {{of the city}} centre, the victims {{encountered}} a barbed wire barrier and numerous Ukrainian police and German troops.

Anyone <b>who</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> escape was beaten. Soon the victims reached an open area, where {{they were forced to}} strip, and then were herded down into the ravine. People were forced to lie down in rows on top of the bodies of other victims, and they were shot {{in the back of the}} head or the neck by members of the execution squads.|$|E

5|$|Az-Zahir Ghazi invaded Cilicia {{to prevent}} Leo from attacking Antioch in 1209. Cilician {{soldiers}} <b>who</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> seize a caravan wounded Guillaume de Chartres, Grand Master of the Knights Templar, in a skirmish {{on the plains}} near Antioch in 1211. Their action annoyed Pope Innocent who excommunicated Leo of Cilicia. Bohemond expelled the Eastern Orthodox patriarch from Antioch, allowing Peter of Ivrea {{to take charge of}} his see. John of Brienne, King of Jerusalem, sent reinforcements to Antioch to fight against the Armenians. Leo dispatched Raymond-Roupen to attack the Templars' domains in Bohemond's principality in 1212.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond {{forced the}} Armenian rulers of Cilicia {{to accept his}} {{suzerainty}} in the late 1180s. He also secured the County of Tripoli for his second son, Bohemond, in 1187. However, Saladin occupied almost the whole Principality of Antioch {{in the summer of}} 1188. To preserve the peace with Saladin, Bohemond did not provide military assistance to the crusaders during the Third Crusade. Leo of Cilicia's expansionist policy in the 1190s gave rise to a lasting conflict between Antioch and Cilicia. Bohemond was captured in 1194 by Leo, <b>who</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> seize Antioch, but the burghers formed a commune and expelled the Armenian soldiers from the town. Bohemond was released only after he acknowledged Leo's independence.|$|E
5|$|Contemporaries {{regarded}} Organt {{as something}} of a salacious novelty and it was quickly banned, but censors <b>who</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> confiscate it discovered that few copies were available anywhere. It did not sell well and resulted in a financial loss for its author. The public's taste for literature had changed in the prelude to the Revolution, and Saint-Just's taste changed with it: aside from a few pages of an unfinished novel found amidst his papers {{at the end of his}} life, Saint-Just devoted his future writing entirely to undecorated essays of social and political theory. With his previous ambitions of literary and lawyerly fame unfulfilled, Saint-Just directed his focus on the single goal of revolutionary command.|$|E

Calvin says that because he bought D'artagnan for $500, D'artagnan (who has only fought three times) must fight at least five times. When Django and Dr. Schultz offer to reimburse Calvin and then change their minds, Calvin has his chief tracker, Mr. Stonecipher, unleash several attack dogs that tear D'artagnan to pieces.|$|E
5|$|From the {{distance}} of our times, Diefenbaker's role as a prairie populist <b>who</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> revolutionize the Conservative Party begins to loom larger than his personal idiosyncrasies. The difficulties he faced {{in the form of}} significant historical dilemmas seem less easy to resolve than Liberals and hostile journalists opined at the time. If Diefenbaker defies rehabilitation, he can at least be appreciated. He stood for a fascinating and still relevant combination of individual and egalitarian values... But his contemporaries were also right in seeing some kind of disorder near the centre of his personality and his prime-ministership. The problems of leadership, authority, power, ego, and a mad time in history overwhelmed the prairie politician with the odd name.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, Crawford was {{included}} in an Australian team which toured North America. The team was organised by Edgar Mayne, a South Australian batsman <b>who</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> secure backing from the Australian Board of Control {{to make it an}} official representative team, but the Board refused to do so. In all matches, Crawford scored over 1,000 runs and took over 200 wickets, and he was particularly effective as a bowler in the matches designated first-class. He later stated that this was the best tour he had been on; more press rumours suggested that he would return to England {{at the conclusion of the}} tour, but he returned to Australia with the rest of the team.|$|E
