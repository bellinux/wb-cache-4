One day, while trying to escape some bullies chasing him, his braces fall off revealing the young Forrest {{to be a very}} fast runner. Despite his low intelligence quotient, Forrest's new running ability leads to him receiving a football scholarship to the University of Alabama in the early 1960s, becoming a top running back, being named on the All-American team, and meeting President John F. Kennedy. After his college graduation, he enlists in the US Army, where he befriends a fellow soldier named Bubba, who convinces Forrest to go into the shrimping business with him when the <b>war</b> <b>is</b> <b>over.</b> In 1967, they are sent to Vietnam and, during an ambush, Bubba is killed in action.

At Carlisle Cuthbert meets an anchorite named Hereberht,who asks to die at the same day and hour as Cuthbert; the request is granted, and subsequently both go to heaven on the same hour of the same night (chapter nine). Cuthbert, dining at Ovington with abbess Ælfflæd, predicts {{the death of one}} of Ælfflæd's servants, Hadwald (chapter ten). The bishop resigns his bishopric after an episcopate of two years and returns to Farne (chapter eleven).

Cuthbert dies on Farne, and his body was washed and dressed before being shipped to Lindisdfarne (chapter thirteen).|$|E
25|$|By this time, however, Hanaya {{has lost}} all his {{defiance}} and is filled only with gratitude towards the villagers. He promises to reward the village with two wagons of grain {{should he be}} released. The villagers agree and return the prisoners to the Japanese Army encampment in the nearby town. However, the Japanese Army has already made Hanaya a war hero, believing that {{he was killed in}} battle. Returning alive after being a prisoner shames the Army. The commander of the encampment, Captain Inokichi Sakatsuka (Kenya Sawada), gives Hanaya a merciless beating but feels honor-bound to fulfill the agreement between the latter and the village. Captain Sakatsuka and his men bring a great bounty of food and wine to the village and hold a feast there that evening, as Ma goes off to fetch his lover Yu'er (Jiang Hongbo) from a neighboring village. During the feast, Captain Sakatsuka demands to have the man who captured Hanaya. He also accuses Ma of sneaking off to fetch resistance fighters. Not given a satisfactory answer, he orders all villagers to be killed and the village to be burned. Ma and Yu'er return on a raft only to find the entire village in flames. Meanwhile, Hanaya is about to commit harakiri before being stopped by Captain Sakatsuka and informed that Japan has recently surrendered, and the <b>war</b> <b>is</b> <b>over.</b>|$|E

500|$|In {{his book}} The River War, Sir Winston Churchill, who {{was present at}} the Battle, summed up the result: [...] "The River <b>War</b> <b>is</b> <b>over.</b> In its varied course, which {{extended}} over fourteen years and involved the untimely destruction of perhaps 300,000 lives, many extremes and contrasts have been displayed, There have been battles which were massacres, and others that were mere parades. There have been occasions of shocking cowardice and surprising heroism... of wisdom and incompetence. But the result is at length achieved and the flags of England and Egypt wave unchallenged over the valley of the Nile".|$|E
500|$|Eric Bumpus and Tim Moranville, {{in their}} book Cease Fire, the <b>War</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Over!,</b> propose that the episode—and by extension, the series as a whole—is a {{rejection}} of [...] "modernity's naturalism" [...] and an acceptance of [...] "post-modernity's mystic supernaturalism". The two argue that, while in stereotypical [...] "great science fiction" [...] the monster created usually runs amok, in [...] "The Post-Modern Prometheus", the creature is [...] "a lovable success". Furthermore, the Indiana townspeople represent [...] "the religious nuts [...] in the end... {{turn out to be}} right".

Comments like these reinforced {{the belief that the}} Duke and Duchess held Nazi sympathies and the effect of the abdication crisis of 1936 was to force off the throne a man with extreme political opinions. Claims that Edward would have been a threat or that he was removed by a political conspiracy to dethrone him remain speculative and [...] "persist largely because since 1936 the contemporary public considerations have lost most of their force and so seem, wrongly, to provide insufficient explanation for the King's departure".|$|E

500|$|Critic Robert Christgau, {{writing in}} Esquire of Pleasures of the Harbor in May 1968, did not {{consider}} this new direction a good turn. While describing Ochs as [...] "unquestionably a nice guy", {{he went on to}} say, [...] "too bad his voice shows an effective range of about half an octave [...] his guitar playing would not suffer much if his right hand were webbed." [...] "Pleasures of the Harbor", Christgau continued, [...] "epitomizes the decadence that has infected pop since Sgt. Pepper. [...] gaudy musical settings ... inspire nostalgia for the three-chord strum." [...] With an ironic sense of humor, Ochs included Christgau's [...] "webbed hand" [...] comment in his 1968 songbook The <b>War</b> <b>is</b> <b>Over</b> on a page titled [...] "The Critics Raved", opposite a full-page picture of Ochs standing in a large metal garbage can. Despite his sense of humor, Ochs was unhappy that his work was not receiving the critical acclaim and popular success he had hoped for. Still, Ochs would joke on the back cover of Greatest Hits that there were 50 Phil Ochs fans ("50 fans can't be wrong!"), a sarcastic reference to an Elvis Presley album that bragged of 50 million Elvis fans.|$|E
500|$|After {{returning}} from Europe, Du Bois was more determined {{than ever to}} gain equal rights for African Americans. Black soldiers {{returning from}} overseas felt {{a new sense of}} power and worth, and were representative of an emerging attitude referred to as the New Negro. In the editorial [...] "Returning Soldiers" [...] he wrote: [...] "But, by the God of Heaven, we are cowards and jackasses if, now that the <b>war</b> <b>is</b> <b>over,</b> we do not marshal every ounce of our brain and brawn to fight a sterner, longer, more unbending battle against the forces of hell in our own land." [...] Many blacks moved to northern cities in search of work, and some northern white workers resented the competition. This labor strife was one of the causes of the Red Summer of 1919, a horrific series of race riots across America, in which over 300 African Americans were killed in over 30 cities. Du Bois documented the atrocities in the pages of The Crisis, culminating in the December publication of a gruesome photograph of a lynching that occurred during the Omaha, Nebraska race riot.|$|E

[...] Fazekas noted that [...] "the challenge" [...] for the season was to find a way to reunite Carter with Edwin Jarvis since he is [...] "not an agent....that's a really important relationship, how do we keep them together?...The nice thing about Peggy this season is she's not having to hide her agenda from the SSR. [...] is helping her out, just in a different way." [...] Elaborating on the SSR's role in the season, Fazekas explained that when Markus and McFeely created the organisation for [...] it was inspired by the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), which was [...] "somewhat disbanded after the war, because it was created because of World War II. So now that the <b>war</b> <b>is</b> <b>over,</b> things are changing. And in real history, the OSS sort of became the CIA and some of its other functions went under other departments. There's a little bit of change going on within SSR and so Thompson [...] has a boss [...] that's going to be saying, [...] "Look, things are changing, and you need to look out for yourself.""
