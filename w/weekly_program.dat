Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 64 This {{descriptive study}} was designed primarily to investigate whether the students' perceived needs are addressed in their classes at Eastern Mediterranean University English Preparatory School (EMUEPS), and if the course syllabi or <b>weekly</b> <b>programs</b> meet the students' needs in terms of preparing them for further studies in their departments. The participants were 28 teachers and administrators, and 80 students from various programs within the institution. Interviews were held with administrators and teachers, a questionnaire was developed and administered to teachers and students. The first research question concerned to what extent what gets taught {{in the classroom is}} based on the course syllabi and <b>weekly</b> <b>programs.</b> According to the results the majority of the teachers say that what gets taught in the classroom is based on the course syllabi and <b>weekly</b> <b>programs.</b> The second research question concerned what extent the <b>weekly</b> <b>programs</b> are based on the course syllabi developed by the skill leaders. The results of the teacher questionnaires indicated that the majority of teachers feel that the <b>weekly</b> <b>programs</b> are based on the course syllabi. However, many teachers were unaware of the difference between the course syllabi and the <b>weekly</b> <b>programs.</b> The third research question concerned to what extent the course syllabi or <b>weekly</b> <b>programs</b> are appropriate {{to the needs of the}} students. Results of the teacher and student questionnaires indicated that the objectives stated in the questionnaires are considered important for the students, by both teachers and students, but are not sufficiently covered in the classroom. The fourth research question concerned to what extent the course syllabi or <b>weekly</b> <b>programs</b> are consistent with the institution's objectives. The results of the teachers' questionnaires indicate that most teachers feel the syllabi and the <b>weekly</b> <b>programs</b> reflect the institution's objectives. However, some teachers said they were not quite sure what the institution's objectives were. In conclusion, the study discovered that the course syllabi or <b>weekly</b> <b>programs</b> for each skill do not cover completely the students' needs in class, and that the teachers do not always know the difference between course syllabi and <b>weekly</b> <b>programs.</b> As a result, most teachers were teaching without knowing the objectives of their lessons. The results of this study suggest that a curricular team should be organized, to ensure consistency among the skill leaders when developing their course syllabi. Furthermore, an explicit curriculum should be developed for EMUEPS in order for there to be coherence among the teaching of the skills in the classes, and across the divisions of the institution (policy, syllabi, teaching resources, testing, teacher training programs, and classroom implementation).

5|$|In 1980, Amway {{purchased}} WHN in New York, giving Mutual {{a second}} major-market owned-and-operated station. On a Country Road, a music show hosted by WHN's Lee Arnold, was introduced and given national distribution. At {{the beginning of}} the year, Mutual had begun airing Mutual Radio Theater, formerly Sears Radio Theater, which it had just picked up. A number of well-regarded dramas were produced as part of the anthology series. In 1981, Mutual launched Dick Clark's National Music Survey, a three-hour-long <b>weekly</b> <b>program</b> combining music and interviews. Despite these developments and the fact that its satellite network was now fully on line, Amway was making little if any profit out of Mutual. The network's corporate parent began backing out of the radio business. Mutual Radio Theater, the network's last ever original dramatic series, aired its final show on December 19, 1981. In November 1983, Amway sold off Mutual's WCFL to Statewide Broadcasting. A year later, a deal was struck for the sale of WHN to Doubleday Broadcasting.|$|E
