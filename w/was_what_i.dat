500|$|Bolton fans {{gave him}} the {{nickname}} [...] "Super Sam Bionic Man" [...] due to his tough tackling approach {{and the way he}} quickly got up after heavy collisions whilst the opposition player would be left flat on the ground. Veteran manager Dave Bassett, a friend of Allardyce, once humorously remarked that [...] "He <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> called a ball-playing defender... If he wasn't playing with the ball he was playing with your balls." [...] He was uncomfortable in possession, and played simple balls to his nearest teammates when he found himself with the ball, whilst teammates would be reluctant to pass to him. He did however possess good awareness and heading skills, and his anticipation made up for his lack of pace.|$|E
500|$|Pearson {{was born}} near Spartanburg, South Carolina. When Pearson was young, he climbed a tree {{at the local}} stock car racing track (Spartanburg Fairgrounds) to see the races. Pearson said, [...] "I'd always been {{interested}} in cars, and I decided right then that <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wanted to do with my life." [...] He worked with his brother in a car body repair shop, and used the money to purchase a Ford coach. Pearson removed the fenders to convert the vehicle into a street rod. He jumped the car over ditches until he rolled it over. His mother paid him to junk the car and he used the money to purchase another car to build. In 1952, he raced a 1940 Ford at dirt tracks and won $30 in an outlaw class race. He kept winning and attracted the attention of Spartanburg's racing community, including Joe Littlejohn.|$|E

500|$|Acting {{gradually}} became {{a passion for}} Hoffman: [...] "I loved the camaraderie of it, the people, and that's when I decided it <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wanted to do." [...] At the age of 17, he was selected to attend the 1984 New York State Summer School of the Arts in Saratoga Springs, where he met his future collaborators Bennett Miller and Dan Futterman. Miller later commented on Hoffman's popularity at the time: [...] "We were attracted {{to the fact that}} he was genuinely serious about what he was doing. Even then, he was passionate." [...] Hoffman applied for several drama degree programs and was accepted to New York University's (NYU) Tisch School of the Arts. Between starting on the program and graduating from Fairport High School, he continued his training at the Circle in the Square Theatre's summer program. Hoffman had positive memories of his time at NYU, where he supported himself by working as an usher. With friends, he co-founded the Bullstoi Ensemble acting troupe. He received a drama degree in 1989.|$|E

He was certainly not learned, but he had a thorough knowledge of many things." [...] "In the lower spheres of diplomacy Mr Kruger was a master", EB Iwan-Müller asserted. [...] "He was quick in detecting the false moves made by his opponents, and an adept in turning them to his own advantage; but of the large combinations he was hopelessly incapable. To secure a brilliant and conspicuous success today he was ready to squander the prospects of the future, if, indeed, he had the power of forecasting them. He <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> believe soldiers would call a brilliant tactician, but a hopeless strategist." [...] Soon after Kruger's death, Smuts told the British humanitarian campaigner Emily Hobhouse: [...] "He typified the Boer character both in its brighter and darker aspects, and was no doubt the greatest man—both morally and intellectually—whom the Boer race has so far produced. In his iron will and tenacity, his 'never say die' attitude towards fate, his mystic faith in another world, he represented what is best in all of us." ...|$|E
500|$|During 1965, Dylan {{composed}} prose, poems, {{and songs}} by typing incessantly. Footage in Dont Look Back of Dylan in his suite at London's Savoy Hotel captures this process. However, Dylan told two interviewers that [...] "Like a Rolling Stone" [...] {{began as a}} long piece of [...] "vomit" [...] (10 pages long according to one account, 20 according to another) that later acquired musical form. Dylan has never publicly spoken of writing any other major composition in this way. In an interview with CBC radio in Montreal, Dylan called {{the creation of the}} song a [...] "breakthrough", explaining that it changed his perception of where he was going in his career. He said that he found himself writing [...] "this long piece of vomit, 20 pages long, and out of it I took 'Like a Rolling Stone' and made it as a single. And I'd never written anything like that before and it suddenly came to me that <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> should do... After writing that I wasn't interested in writing a novel, or a play.

[...] Sometimes, {{inspiration}} for plot points in the Gilbert and Sullivan operas was provided by characteristics of the performers themselves. [...] For instance, Gilbert noted {{in an interview that}} the fact that the female singers to be engaged for The Mikado, Leonora Braham, Bond, and Sybil Grey, were all of short stature inspired him to make them schoolgirls—three [...] "little" [...] maids—and to treat them as a closely linked trio throughout the work as much as possible. [...] Bond, however, knew how to stand out on stage. [...] During preparations for The Mikado, she persuaded the wardrobe mistress to make the obi of her costume twice as big as that of the other [...] "little maids". [...] She wrote: [...] "I made the most of my big, big bow, turning my back to the audience whenever I got a chance, and waggling it. [...] The gallery was delighted, but I nearly got the sack for that prank! [...] However, I did get noticed, which <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wanted." ...|$|E
500|$|Hiddleston is {{well known}} for his {{portrayal}} of Loki in the 2011 Marvel Studios film, Thor. He was invited to audition by Kenneth Branagh, the film's director, after having previously worked with Branagh on Ivanov and Wallander. Hiddleston said of Branagh, [...] "Ken has had a life-changing effect. He was able to say to the executives, 'Trust me on this, you can cast Tom and he will deliver'. It was massive and it's completely changed the course of what is available to me to do. Ken gave me my break." [...] In the beginning, he originally auditioned for the part of Thor. [...] "I initially auditioned to play Thor. That <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was being considered for, because I'm tall and blonde and classically trained, and that seemed to be the mold for what Thor was, he was to be a classical character. And it was in my auditions. I owe this entirely to Marvel and their open-mindedness, they saw something that they thought was interesting. They saw some temperament that they liked." [...] The casting director gave Hiddleston six weeks to bulk up, so he went on a strict diet and gained twenty pounds of muscle. In the end, Branagh decided he was more suitable as the antagonist and cast him as Loki.|$|E
500|$|SEAL Team 10's quick-reaction force (QRF) commander. Bana {{had read}} the book Lone Survivor prior to production, and was willing {{to appear in the}} film, {{regardless}} of which role was offered to him. Upon being cast as Kristensen, Bana researched the fallen serviceman and his family. On joining the production of Lone Survivor, Bana stated, [...] "There are two factors that make this story special, and they are the reasons why I jumped on board. One is the story itself, and two is who chooses to direct a project like this. I knew how involved [...] would be and that he would know how to portray SEAL teammates. That <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> {{wanted to be a part}} of. The greatest way to honor these guys is to make a great film and have it stand the test of time." [...] Bana did not physically prepare for the role. [...] "My responsibility was really to understand the role of the mission commander and the relevant information with respect with the chain of command and what it means to go in the QRF and the processes involved", he explained. [...] "It was far more important to be the person that was responsible for that part of the story and understand that completely.

500|$|Hebel {{lived in}} Karlsruhe until his death, but made {{occasional}} journeys to other regions. His wish {{to become a}} parish priest in Wiesental was never fulfilled, though he wrote an inaugural sermon for a rural parish in 1820. In this sermon he wrote, [...] "to live and die as a pastor in a peaceful country town, among honest people, has always been my sole wish, up to this hour; it <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wished for in the happiest and in the darkest moments of my life". Instead, he was [...] "led higher and higher by an invisible hand, ever further away from my modest goals". In 1805 he was offered the Lutheran parish of Freiburg im Breisgau, but he declined it {{at the behest of}} Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Baden. He was rewarded in 1808 with his appointment as director of the Gymnasium in Karlsruhe. In 1819 he became a prelate of the Lutheran regional church, a leading position that brought with it a seat in the Upper House of the Parliament (Ständeversammlung) of Baden. As a member of parliament he devoted himself mainly to education, the church and social policy. He later gave a speech at the consecration of the statehouse in Karlsruhe. Even though the Lutheran and Reformed regional churches of Baden merged in 1821 with strong support from his side, into today's Evangelische Landeskirche in Baden, his position as the prelate of the unified Protestant church was not endangered.|$|E
500|$|In the Test match, {{which began}} on 6 December 1963, Australia batted first; Meckiff contributed seven runs before being bowled by Peter Pollock. On the second day, after the Australian innings ended on 435, South Africa began to bat {{just after the}} luncheon interval. Bowling from the Stanley Street End, Graham McKenzie conceded 13 runs from the first over. Meckiff took the ball for the second over, bowling from the Vulture Street End to South African captain Trevor Goddard. At the same time, the South African manager Ken Viljoen set up a camera square of the wicket among the spectators and began filming the left-armer's bowling action. Meckiff was no-balled four times by Egar—who was {{standing}} at square leg—in what would be his only over of the match. After the Victorian bowled a gentle [...] "loosener" [...] as his first ball (and escaped a front-foot no-ball call), [...] "the drama began". Egar ruled the second, third, fifth and ninth balls to be throws, and therefore illegitimate. After the third and fifth balls—the latter a full toss that Goddard hit for four—Benaud came over to consult his fast bowler. After the ninth ball, Meckiff and Benaud had another meeting, and the remaining three balls were deemed to be fair. In the meantime, the crowd roared loudly, heckling Egar and supporting the beleaguered bowler. Meckiff had previously been passed in five countries, having played Tests in four of these nations. Egar had cleared his bowling on five previous occasions, in three Shield matches and two Tests; the Victorian had bowled 119.1 overs in these games without incident. Egar later said [...] "My only judgement <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> saw at the time". Benaud removed his paceman from the attack and Meckiff did not bowl again in the match, later saying {{he could not remember}} the over because he was absorbed by a feeling of complete deflation.|$|E
