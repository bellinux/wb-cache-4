Johnson wants to take her investigation beyond “the white male Euro-American literary, philosophical, psychoanalytical, and critical canon” that dominates the academy as a whole and her work in particular (p.2). But she also calls the “sameness” of that white Euro-American literary and critical tradition into question, undertaking a thorough interrogation of its boundaries. In addition, Johnson expands the scope of her literary subjects to include black and/or women writers, such as Zora Neale Hurston, Dorothy Dinnerstein, James Weldon Johnson, and Adrienne Rich. [...] Her subsequent collection, The Feminist Difference (1998), offers a continued critique of the terms in play throughout feminism’s history and an examination of the differences within and between feminisms.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout her work, Johnson {{emphasizes}} {{both the}} difficulty of applying deconstruction to political action and of separating linguistic contradictions, complexities, and polysemy from political questions. In A <b>World</b> <b>of</b> <b>Difference,</b> she makes a turn to a “real world,” but one which is always left in quotation marks—"real," [...] but nonetheless inseparable from its textual, written aspect. In a chapter of the book entitled, “Is Writerliness Conservative?” Johnson examines {{the political implications of}} undecidablility in writing, as well as the consequences of labeling the poetic and the undecidable as politically inert. She writes that, if “poetry makes nothing happen,” poetry also “makes nothing happen”—the limits of the political are themselves fraught with political implications (p.30). Harold Schweizer writes in his introduction to The Wake of Deconstruction that “f interpretive closure always violates textual indeterminacy, if authority is perhaps fundamentally non-textual, reducing to identity what should remain different, Johnson’s work could best be summarized as an attempt to delay the inevitable reductionist desire for meaning” (p.8).|$|E

40|$|I {{began my}} work at UCSD with designs {{that were more}} {{complicated}} externally with as many wild elements as possible. I {{have learned how to}} take a wide range of ideas, and instead of spreading them thin across a broad swathe of elements I can now incorporate them into a rich yet narrow pallet of carefully tuned elements. With Joe Turner's Come and Gone, I had taken the needlessly complicated ideas that could have been externalized, and fed them into the details of my design. Certain critical concepts were contained within individual elements such as the texture of the floorboards, or the “hand carved“ patterns to echo traditional African art where a simple clean line would have sufficed. With Space Between, directed by Alicia Peterson Baskel, my only design elements were white gallery walls, and the art that was displayed on them. Here, the positioning of drawings and videos was absolutely critical with mere inches making <b>worlds</b> <b>of</b> <b>difference,</b> and minor subtleties of wall texture speaking volumes about nature of the space. The twist was that after all of this precise work, these moving walls were released to the dancers to improvise with them however they wanted. Having calculated all of details so carefully afforded us the room for total improvisation with movement. The lesson I have drawn is that the more limited the elements, the more precise the fine tuning required, but the more universal their ability to connect, and the more likely an audience will read them properly...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present and examine the most {{important}} features of feminism through three 20 th century short stories, Doris Lessing‟s “A Woman on a Roof”, Ethel M Dell‟s “The Magic Circle”, and Alice Munro‟s “Boys and Girls”. In the “A Woman on a Roof” we experience how humiliating it is to be exposed to, and therefore absolutely objectified by male gaze. We also learn what happens, if a woman disregards culturally ingrained chauvinistic order. Doris Lessing‟s work was written before the sexual revolution, and it places men‟s fear from the mere possibility of female independence in the centre. Alice Munro‟s short story introduces us into the <b>world</b> <b>of</b> <b>differences</b> between the two sexes both in childhood and in adulthood. Dissimilarities are often resulted in unequal relationships between the partners. Women are often associated with animals rather than with human beings. Maternity and the aspects of mother-child relationships are also in the focus of the literary work. “The Magic Circle” is about male domination within marriage and strict restrictions imposed upon women by their husbands. Unfulfilled wishes of wives and their silent suffering as a consequence of their husbands‟ noncompliance are also revealed. In reality, however, husbands simply play roles when they ignore their wives. Their reasons for resisting their overwhelming desire to be loved are also enumerated by the author. The story has a surprisingly positive outcome with an unwanted change in the husband‟s attitude that can be the forerunner of societal changes in real life. Bscanglisztik...|$|R

Being of a perhaps more primal and misunderstood nature, sex has also been employed as a tool of oppression, alongside race and culture. Writers such as James Baldwin and Lonny Kaneko explore the idea of how whites use race, culture, and sex together as a means of suppressing the cultural identities of non-whites. Baldwin’s short story “Going to Meet the Man” brings to life a white man whose entire racist ideology is based upon a link between violence, sex, and his experiences with a Southern lynch mob. His own masculinity is defined by the connection between racism and sexual violence. Kaneko’s short story “The Shoyu Kid” reaches into another instance in American history, by depicting a group of young Japanese boys whose ideas of masculinity and identity are splintered and clouded by a pedophilic internment camp guard. While the two writers draw upon quite different backgrounds and contexts, they both exemplify the way in which sex is used to devalue the cultural identities of non-whites. Through both the hypersexualization of the African American male and the emasculation of the Asian American male, Baldwin and Kaneko both explore how ethnic masculinity is attacked, white supremacy is imposed, and non-white cultural identity is eventually invalidated...|$|R
