5|$|Although Rossier's time in Japan <b>was</b> <b>brief</b> and the {{surviving}} photographic legacy of his sojourn is scant, he nevertheless had a lasting impact on photography in the country.|$|E
5|$|Baxter {{moved back}} to Rangers. His return to Rangers <b>was</b> <b>brief,</b> as he retired from {{football}} in 1970, aged only 31.

5|$|A change {{occurred}} {{in the game and}} the role of the goalkeeper in the 1880s, when the Scottish reduced the size of the scoring area by placing rugby posts, spaced about 10 feet apart, at each end of the pool. At the same time, the rules were changed to allow goalkeepers to stand on the pool deck and leap onto the head of an opposing player who approached the goal. This change in the rules <b>was</b> <b>brief.</b> To prevent the serious injuries that resulted from this method of goalkeeping, the rules were revised again to require the goalie to remain in the water.|$|E
5|$|Affeldt {{was placed}} on the {{disabled}} list after only four games with blister problems again. His time on the DL <b>was</b> <b>brief</b> and he returned to the Royals on May 6. On May 28, he struck out a career high eight hitters in a win against the Minnesota Twins. Later, on June 6, he notched his first hit.|$|E
5|$|After the {{disappearance}} of Olubei from the scene ca. 1458, no princes are known by name until Isaac in 1465, possibly Olubei's son. Isaac was overthrown in 1475 by his brother Alexander due to his pro-Ottoman stance. His reign <b>was</b> <b>brief,</b> as the Ottoman Empire laid siege and conquered Theodoro itself in December. Alexander {{and his family were}} taken captive to Constantinople, where the prince was beheaded, his son was forcibly converted to Islam, and his wife and daughters became part of the Sultan's harem.|$|E

5|$|Courtier and {{journalist}} Dermot Morrah alleged that there <b>was</b> <b>brief</b> speculation {{as to the}} desirability of bypassing Albert (and his children) and his brother, Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, in favour of their younger brother Prince George, Duke of Kent. This {{seems to have been}} suggested on the grounds that Prince George was at that time the only brother with a son.|$|E
5|$|Fausto's {{remnants}} passed {{north of}} the Hawaiian Islands uneventfully until they interacted with a tropical upper-tropospheric trough (TUTT) on August 30. In combination with warm waters, a tropical depression with some subtropical features developed. At {{this time it was}} located around latitude 30°N. By September 1, Fausto had redeveloped into a tiny but tropical ministorm. Its rebirth <b>was</b> <b>brief,</b> however, as a mid-latitude cyclone absorbed the system early on September 3.|$|E
5|$|Hancock's {{time in the}} West <b>was</b> <b>brief.</b> President Johnson, {{unhappy with}} the way Republican generals were {{governing}} the South under Reconstruction, sought replacements for them. The general who offended Johnson the most was Philip Sheridan, and Johnson soon ordered General Grant to switch the assignments of Hancock and Sheridan, believing that Hancock, a Democrat, would govern in a style more to Johnson's liking. Although neither man {{was pleased with the}} change, Sheridan reported to Fort Leavenworth and Hancock to New Orleans.|$|E

5|$|His {{period in}} command <b>was</b> <b>brief,</b> for on 22 November he, like other brigadier generals, was replaced, and {{returned}} to the 84th Infantry Brigade. The 42nd Division was chosen to participate in the occupation of the Rhineland, occupying the Ahrweiler district. In April 1919, they entrained for Brest and Saint-Nazaire, where they boarded ships to return to the United States. MacArthur traveled on the ocean liner , which reached New York on 25 April 1919.|$|E
5|$|However, the prisoners' time {{in prison}} <b>was</b> <b>brief,</b> as Diệm was deposed and killed in a coup in November 1963. On November 8, {{political}} opponents who had been imprisoned {{on the island of}} Poulo Condore were released by the military junta. Đán was garlanded and taken to military headquarters, and on November 10, Suu was released and welcomed by a large crowd at the town hall. Suu later served as president for a brief period and Dan as a deputy prime minister. Thi, Đông and Lieu returned to South Vietnam and resumed their service in the ARVN.|$|E
5|$|I Corps' {{part in the}} Western Desert Campaign <b>was</b> <b>brief.</b> Its {{headquarters}} opened near Benghazi on 15 February 1941, replacing British XIII Corps. Rowell {{studied the}} prospects of an advance on Tripoli, but the headquarters was recalled to Egypt on 24 February {{to participate in the}} Battle of Greece. Nonetheless, for his part, Rowell was mentioned in despatches, and appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire.|$|E

5|$|In February 1955, Saban was {{promoted}} to head coach at Northwestern, succeeding Bob Voigts and becoming the youngest coach in the Big Ten Conference at 33 years old. Saban's tenure {{as coach of the}} Northwestern Wildcats football team, however, <b>was</b> <b>brief</b> and unsuccessful. Hampered by injuries, the team lost all of its games in 1955, and calls intensified for Saban's firing as the season wore on. In December, Saban and his entire staff were fired by new athletic director Stu Holcomb. Ara Parseghian was named as his replacement.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the five official tropical cyclones, a disturbance {{in the middle of}} September that tracked from east of the Lesser Antilles to off the coast of Canada was studied for potential classification. Despite producing gale-force winds, the system was likely extratropical in nature, and any time it may have spent as a tropical storm <b>was</b> <b>brief.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 27 May 1940, after over {{fifteen years}} on the unattached list, Cannan was {{appointed}} Inspector General of Administration at the Department of Defence Coordination. Although his tenure <b>was</b> <b>brief,</b> Cannan gained valuable experience working with the bureaucracy. On 7 July 1940, Cannan was promoted to temporary major general and took over command of the 2nd Division in succession to Major General Iven Mackay, who had been appointed to command the 6th Division.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{transitioning}} into {{a tropical}} cyclone, the depression executed an elongated counter-clockwise loop to the northeast. Conditions favored further intensification, {{and based on}} ship reports, it is estimated the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Bertha early on July28. Bertha quickly strengthened to attain hurricane status early on July29 about halfway between Cape Canaveral, Florida and Bermuda. The strengthening trend <b>was</b> <b>brief,</b> however, as increased vertical wind shear weakened it back to a tropical storm late on July29, with the center exposed from the deep convection. Bertha continued slowly northeastward to ridging from the Bermuda high extending westward to the United States.|$|E
5|$|Washington's second inauguration {{took place}} in the Senate Chamber of Congress Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (the first at this site) on March 4, 1793. The presidential oath of office was {{administered}} by Supreme Court associate justice William Cushing. Washington's inaugural address was just 135 words, the shortest to date. This inauguration <b>was</b> <b>brief</b> and simple, a sharp contrast to the extravaganza four years earlier, which, in the eyes of many, had all the trappings of a monarchical coronation.|$|E
5|$|While in England, Godwin took {{a course}} in {{creative}} writing at the City Literature Institute, where she met her second husband, psychiatrist Ian Marshall.

At age 29, she {{took a job as}} fact-checker in New York City for The Saturday Evening Post. She said the job was embarrassing, because {{she wanted to be a}} writer, as opposed to fact-checking the work of others.|$|E
