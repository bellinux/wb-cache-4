6000|$|... "You may {{rely upon}} me," [...] Arnold promised, {{slipping}} {{down from the}} barrel. [...] "He's really quite a decent old chap, and if I can find out <b>what's</b> <b>worrying</b> him, and can help, I'll do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How that joist {{could have}} got away without some one to help it is <b>what</b> <b>worries</b> me," [...] Joe interrupted. [...] "I set it, an' know the weight from above could not have any effect." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I know that; {{and that}} is <b>what</b> <b>worries</b> me more than anything. Still I cannot help {{thinking}} that he will try some how {{to get into the}} army. If he can't, I believe he will do anything he can to get a living until they enlist him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, don't {{worry about}} {{something}} to eat!" [...] cried Dave. [...] "We {{can go down}} to Carpen Falls and get whatever we want, and also get some extra kitchen utensils, and don't forget the deer-meat. <b>What</b> <b>worries</b> me {{is the loss of}} Laura's rings and Mrs. Basswood's silverware." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's <b>what</b> <b>worried</b> me, until I {{thought of}} the slippers," [...] said the Scarecrow. [...] "You'll have to THINK, Dorothy; that's {{the only way to}} get a good idea. If I hadn't such {{wonderful}} brains, I'd never have thought of those straw foot-decorations." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I know," [...] {{said the}} cook; [...] "that’s <b>what’s</b> <b>worrying</b> me a bit." [...] "Don’t worry about me," [...] {{said the old}} man, pausing {{with his hand on}} the other’s shoulder; [...] "I’m not worth it. Don’t look so glum, lad." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "See here," [...] cried he, leaning forward, [...] "what's it all about? Let's have it. If you've {{anything}} to say about those articles, say it right out. Never mind our best interests. We can look after them. Let's have <b>what's</b> <b>worrying</b> you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Cut {{that kind}} of talk," [...] replied Belding, bluntly. [...] "Well, if it is Rojas he's acting damn strange for a raider. That's <b>what</b> <b>worries</b> me. We can't do {{anything}} but wait. With Laddy and Yaqui out there we won't be surprised. Let's take the best possible view of the situation until we know more. That'll not likely be before to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You did {{perfectly}} right, Hans, and I'll {{back you}} in it. I'm {{something of a}} dabster at law myself, and I'll see that Kitsong don't railroad you into jail. <b>What</b> <b>worries</b> me is the general opposition now being manifested. With the whole Shellfish Valley on edge, your work will be hampered. It will make your position unpleasant for a while at least." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Blair cheerfully, [...] "suppose I admit {{you are all}} right, physically, you'll confess {{you have}} some trouble on your mind, won't you? If I can't make you SHOW me your tongue, you'll let me hear you USE it to tell me <b>what</b> <b>worries</b> you.

60|$|<b>What</b> <b>worried</b> {{her most}} {{was that the}} bread was nearly gone, and another meal for herself and Toto would empty the basket. To be sure neither the Woodman nor the Scarecrow ever ate anything, {{but she was not}} made of tin nor straw, and could not live unless she was fed.|$|R
6000|$|... "I never exactly saw Mr. Morgan," [...] he says, [...] "because Mr. Morgan's been in Europe for a month. But <b>what's</b> <b>worrying</b> me, Billy, is this: The {{department}} stores have all got that same picture on sale, framed, for $3.48. And they charge $3.50 for the frame alone--that's what I can't understand." ...|$|R

And she doesn't appear {{to realize how}} wicked she's been at all--that's <b>what</b> <b>worries</b> me most. If she'd really felt sorry it wouldn't be so bad. And you don't seem to realize it, neither; you're making excuses for {{her all the time}} to yourself--I can see that." ...|$|E
6000|$|But she wasn't {{thinking}} [...] "Yes." [...] She was thinking, [...] "Milt, <b>what</b> <b>worries</b> me now isn't how I can risk {{letting the}} 'nice people' meet you. It's how I can ever waste {{you on the}} 'nice people.' Oh, I'm spoiled for cut-glass-and-velvet afternoons. Eternal spiritual agony over blue-room taps is too high a price even for four-poster beds. I want to be driving! hiking! living!" ...|$|E

[...] "I don't {{know much about}} Joe, seein' as we haven't met before for many a long year, an' all I {{remember}} about our boyhood days is that we fit an' pulled hair most o' the time. But <b>what</b> <b>worries</b> me most is Joe's lookin' so much like me myself, wooden leg an' all. Don't you think it's rather cheeky an' unbrotherly, Trot?" ...|$|E

60|$|<b>What</b> <b>worried</b> {{her most}} {{was that he}} was not nigh her, now that her sentimental romance was {{reaching}} its super-acute crisis. During her guardian's temporary absence from Acol she had made earnest and resolute efforts to see her mysterious lover. She thought that he must know that Sir Marmaduke and Mistress de Chavasse were away and that she herself was free momentarily from watchful eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{dragged the}} book {{away from the}} old man, and began to study. There was so many {{complaints}} in it he was almost tempted to have something else instead of consumption, but he decided on that at last, an’ he got a cough <b>what</b> <b>worried</b> the fo’c’sle all night long, an’ the next day, when the skipper came down to see Dan, he could ’ardly ’ear hisself speak.|$|R
6000|$|ASHER (smiling involuntarily). Well, it's been {{a comfort}} {{to drop in}} here and talk to you, {{in spite of what}} you believe. You've got the gift of sympathy, Jonathan. But I don't approve of you're {{spending}} your time in this sort of work--(he waves a hand toward the bench)--which may never come to anything, and in doctoring people for nothing and patching up their troubles. I daresay you enjoy it, but <b>what</b> <b>worries</b> me is how you are going to live? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I really don't {{object to}} platitudes," [...] he told Ruth later; [...] "but <b>what</b> <b>worries</b> me into {{nervousness}} is the pompous, smugly complacent, superior certitude {{with which they}} are uttered and the time taken to do it. Why, I could give that man the whole history of the Reformation in the time he took to tell me that the Union-Labor Party had fused with the Democrats. Do you know, he skins his words as a professional poker-player skins the cards that are dealt out to him. Some day I'll show you what I mean." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Well, what I mean is, {{what are}} we to do about this one?’ {{pointing}} to the postillion in front of us, as he alternately hid and revealed his patched breeches to the trot of his horse. ‘He see you get in this morning under Mr. Ramornie—I was very piticular to Mr. Ramornie you, if you remember, sir—and he see you get in again under Mr. Saint Eaves, and whatever’s he going to see you get out under? that’s <b>what</b> <b>worries</b> me, sir. It don’t seem to me like as if the position was what you call stratetegic!’ ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Indeed, yes,' said Midmore {{with a deep}} sigh. The old tricks were {{sprouting}} in the old atmosphere like {{mushrooms in}} a dung-pit. He passed into an abrupt reverie, shook his head, as though stung by tumultuous memories, and departed without any ceremony of farewell to--catch a mid-afternoon express where a man meets associates who talk horse, and weather as it affects the horse, all the way down. <b>What</b> <b>worried</b> him most {{was that he had}} missed a day with the hounds.|$|R
6000|$|... "Some folks find {{it almost}} as {{soothing}} {{to tell their}} friends <b>what</b> is <b>worrying</b> them, and I scarcely think it's more risky," [...] said Miss Schuyler.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{met him in}} Montana {{with the}} most gorgeously atrocious person I've ever encountered--one Pinky Westlake, or some such a name--positively, a crook! He tried to get Boltwood and myself {{interested}} in the commonest kind of a mining swindle--hinted that we were {{to join him in}} cheating the public. And this Daggett was his partner--they actually traveled together. But I do want to be just. I'm not sure that Daggett was aware of his partner's dishonesty. That isn't <b>what</b> <b>worries</b> me about the lad. It's his utter impossibility. He's as crude as iron-ore. When he's being careful, he may manage to be inconspicuous, but give him the chance---- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, it was rotten mean of me," [...] {{admitted}} Mary easily. [...] "I dunno what possessed me. That old codfish {{seemed to}} come in so blamed handy. But I was awful sorry--I cried last night after I went to bed about it, honest I did. You ask Una if I didn't. I wouldn't tell her what for 'cause I was ashamed of it, and then she cried, too, because she was afraid someone had hurt my feelings. Laws, I ain't got any feelings to hurt worth speaking of. <b>What</b> <b>worries</b> me is why Mrs. Wiley hain't been hunting for me. It ain't like her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Some brute {{of a man}} says, in some {{book which}} I once read, that no woman can keep two {{separate}} trains of ideas in her mind at the same time. I declare you have almost satisfied me that the man is right. What! when you have escaped unnoticed to your place of business, and when you suspect this house to be watched, you propose to come back here, and {{to put it in}} the parson's power to recover the lost trace of you! What madness! Stop where you are; and when you have got over your difficulty at Pimlico (it is some woman's business, of course; <b>what</b> <b>worries</b> women are!), be so good as to read what I have got to say about our difficulty at Brompton.|$|E
5000|$|Germanus either {{resigned}} or was deposed {{following the}} ban. Surviving letters Germanus wrote {{at the time}} say little of theology. According to Patricia Karlin-Hayter, <b>what</b> <b>worried</b> Germanus was that the ban of icons would prove that the Church had been in error {{for a long time}} and therefore play into the hands of Jews and Muslims. Tradition depicts Germanos as much more determined in his position. Even winning a debate on the matter with Constantine, Bishop of Nacoleia, a leading Iconoclast. Pope Gregory II (term 715-731), a fellow iconodule, praised Germanus' [...] "zeal and steadfastness".|$|R
60|$|Casey {{fixed his}} eyes upon {{the curve of}} the track ahead where it {{disappeared}} between the sage-covered sandy banks. Here the grade was scarcely perceptible to any but experienced eyes. And the gravel-car crept along as if it would stop any moment. But Casey knew that it was not likely to stop, and if it did he could start it again. A heavy-laden car like this, once started, would run a long way on a very little grade. <b>What</b> <b>worried</b> him was the creaking and rattle of wheels, sounds that from where he stood were apparently very loud.|$|R
6000|$|... “One {{can never}} be certain,” said Clovis; “now and then he gets some idea about a guest which might take an unfortunate turn. That is {{precisely}} <b>what</b> is <b>worrying</b> me at the present moment.” ...|$|R
