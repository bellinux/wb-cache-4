5|$|Much of what {{is known}} about Barbauld's life comes from two memoirs, the first {{published}} in 1825 and written by her niece Lucy Aikin, the second published in 1874 and written by her great-niece Anna Letitia Le Breton. Some letters from Barbauld to others also exist, however, a great many Barbauld family documents were lost in a fire that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> London blitz in 1940.|$|E
5|$|The action {{came over}} {{eight months after}} the British had {{achieved}} a decisive victory over the French at the Battle of Lissa and was the first squadron action since that engagement. The action of November 1811 <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British interception of a French military convoy traveling from Corfu to Trieste with a consignment of cannon, and resulted in a British victory, only one French ship escaping capture by the British force. It has been suggested that this action was a factor in Napoleon's decision to change the direction of his planned eastwards expansion in 1812 from the Balkans to Russia.|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} {{damage was}} done on the lakes. Major shipwrecks occurred on all but Lake Ontario, with most happening on southern and western Lake Huron. Lake masters recounted that waves reached at least 35feet (11m) in height. Being shorter in length than waves ordinarily formed by gales, they occurred in rapid succession, with three waves frequently striking in succession. Masters also stated that the wind often blew in directions opposite to the waves below. This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm's cyclonic motion, a phenomenon rarely seen on the Great Lakes.|$|E

5|$|A ridge located {{over the}} central Philippines caused Conson to turn towards the north. Continuing to intensify, the JTWC {{assessed}} the storm {{to have reached}} typhoon status at 1800UTC on June7. The JMA also upgraded the storm to a typhoon about twelve hours later. A 28km (17mi) wide eye developed as the cyclone turned towards the northeast. Originally, forecasts showed the typhoon making landfall in southern Taiwan but the turn towards the northeast spared the island from a direct hit. Shortly after being classified as a typhoon by the JMA, the JTWC upgraded Conson to a Category 2 typhoon on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale with winds of 155km/h (100mph 1-minute winds). The eye later became slightly disorganized and the cloud tops around the center warmed. However, the storm reorganized {{the next day and}} was upgraded to a Category 3 typhoon by the JTWC with winds of 185km/h (115mph 1-minute winds). The intensification <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> influence of an approaching shortwave trough which enhanced poleward outflow. Around this time, PAGASA issued their final advisory on Typhoon 'Frank' as it moved out of their area of responsibility.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} suggests that Bronze Age people had settled {{in the area around}} 1000 BC, although it is not known whether these settlements were permanent or temporary. The town itself was founded in the 11th century when Benedictine monks established a priory {{at the foot of the}} highest peak of Malvern Hills. During the 19th century Malvern developed rapidly from a village to a sprawling conurbation owing to its popularity as a hydrotherapy spa based on its spring waters. Immediately following the decline of spa tourism towards the end of the 19th century, the town's focus shifted to education with the establishment of several private boarding schools in former hotels and large villas. A further major expansion <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relocation of the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) to Malvern in 1942. QinetiQ, TRE's successor company, remains the town's largest local employer.|$|E

5|$|Claire's main storyline {{in season}} 2 is her advocacy, as Second Lady, for {{a sexual assault}} {{prevention}} bill. During her campaign for the bill a skeleton from her college days emerges: during a nationally televised interview, she admits that she was raped in college and that her rapist, Dalton McGinnis (Peter Bradbury), is now a high-ranking general. (She had earlier had an uncomfortable encounter with McGinnis at a White House dinner, during which she had told Frank what the general had done to her.) She also admits to having aborted a pregnancy that she claims <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rape; it is later revealed that she in fact aborted Frank's child, with his consent. She then converts the focus on that issue into political support that becomes critical to the Underwoods' ascension to the Oval Office.|$|E
5|$|Despite being named, Rafael {{remained}} disorganized initially; this <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{interaction between}} an upper-level trough and the cyclone itself. Moderate to strong wind shear dislocated {{the center of}} Rafael and the deepest shower and thunderstorm activity. Over {{the course of the}} next few days, however, the upper-level trough gradually weakened and backed westward, allowing for the development of an anticyclone atop the tropical storm. Wind shear lessened, allowing the center to become obscured from view and outflow to develop in association with the system. As it began to execute a turn towards the north under the influence of an upper-level trough to its west, a central dense overcast was noted on satellite imagery. Following a series of intensity estimates, Rafael was upgraded to a hurricane around 0600UTC on October15, while positioned about 650mi (1045km) south of Bermuda, although this intensity was speculated upon until later that afternoon following a hurricane hunters flight into the system.|$|E
5|$|In North Carolina, {{there was}} often a {{strategy}} of nominally accepting Brown, but tacitly resisting it. On May 18, 1954 the Greensboro, North Carolina school board declared that it would abide by the Brown ruling. This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> initiative of D.E. Hudgins Jr, a former Rhodes Scholar and prominent attorney, who chaired the school board. This made Greensboro the first, and for years the only, city in the South, to announce its intent to comply. However, others in the city resisted integration, putting up legal obstacles to the actual implementation of school desegregation for years afterward, and in 1969, the federal government found the city was not {{in compliance with the}} 1964 Civil Rights Act. Transition to a fully integrated school system did not begin until 1971, after numerous local lawsuits and both nonviolent and violent demonstrations. Historians have noted the irony that Greensboro, which had heralded itself as such a progressive city, {{was one of the last}} holdouts for school desegregation.|$|E

5|$|Since the 1990s, the {{official}} State Flag of Georgia {{had been a}} center of controversy as it incorporated the historic Confederate flag dating to the American Civil War, which among some people is thought to symbolize resistance to cultural changes in the state. After 2001 changes to the flag which removed this, Governor of Georgia Roy Barnes, who had led the flag-redesign effort, was defeated for re-election; many thought it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> political backlash. The 1956 version with the Confederate States of America battle emblem, known as a St.Andrew's cross, was a continuing topic of debate for southern heritage proponents. Reed served as one of Governor Sonny Perdue's floor leaders in debates {{that led to the}} ratification of the current (2003) version of the state flag.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the second}} half of the 18th century, when Brazil was still a colony, the {{government}} had attempted to gather data regarding the population. However, few captaincies (later called provinces) collected the requested information. After independence the government instituted a commission for statistics in an 1829 decree with a mandate to hold a national census. The commission was a failure and was disbanded in 1834. In the ensuing years, provincial governments were tasked with collecting census information, but their census reports were often incomplete or not submitted at all. In 1851, another attempt at a nationwide census failed when rioting broke out. This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> erroneous belief among Brazilians of mixed-race descent that the survey was a subterfuge designed to enslave anyone having African blood.|$|E
5|$|Sometime after Lochry's Defeat, Brant and Simon Girty {{got into}} an altercation along the Ohio River. According to {{contemporary}} gossip, Girty took exception to Brant's boasting about {{the success of the}} expedition, perhaps because Girty believed his brother George deserved more credit. The two men, who were reportedly drunk, came to blows, which ended when Brant slashed Girty in the head with his sword. The wound, which took several months to heal, left a scar on Girty's forehead. When Brant returned to Detroit in October, he had a sword cut on his leg, which had become infected and initially looked as if it would result in amputation. The wound was officially reported as accidentally self-inflicted, although gossipers said that it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fight with Girty. Brant's Iroquois companions returned home, but Brant was compelled to stay in Detroit over the winter in order to recover.|$|E

5|$|The Kokinshū, Tales of Ise and Tales of Yamato all {{describe}} Narihira leaving Kyoto {{to travel}} east through the Tōkaidō region and crossing the Sumida River, composing poems at famous places (see utamakura) along the way. The Tales of Ise implies this journey <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scandalous affair between Narihira and Fujiwara no Takaiko. There are doubts {{as to whether}} this journey actually took place, {{from the point of}} view both that the number of surviving poems is quite small for having made such a trip and composing poems along the way, and in terms of the historical likelihood that a courtier could have gone wandering to the other end of the country with only one or two friends keeping him company.|$|E
5|$|The MOD {{commissioned}} {{a series of}} multi-beam sonar surveys to image the wreck and appraise its condition. The high-resolution sonograms showed Royal Oak to be lying almost upside down with her top works forced into the seabed. The tip of the bow had been blown off by U-47s first torpedo and a gaping hole on the starboard flank <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> triple strike from her second successful salvo. Following several years of delays, Briggs Marine was contracted by the MoD to conduct the task of pumping off the remaining oil. Royal Oaks mid-construction conversion to fuel oil had placed her fuel tanks in unconventional positions, complicating operations. By 2006, all double bottom tanks had been cleared and the task of removing oil from the inner wing tanks with cold cutting equipment began the next year. By 2010, some 1600 tonnes of fuel oil had been removed, and the wreck was declared to be no longer actively releasing oil into Scapa Flow. Operations continue at a reduced pace to tackle the oil known to be remaining (state for 2012).|$|E
5|$|The {{disaster}} and investigation received widespread media coverage. The {{impact on the}} public was increased by the dramatic effect of an amateur photo taken of the aircraft rolling that was published {{on the front page of}} the Chicago Tribune on the Sunday two days after the crash. There were some early reports that a collision with a small aircraft had been the cause of the crash. This apparently <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> discovery of small-aircraft parts among the wreckage at the crash site. National Transportation Safety Board vice-chairman Elwood T. Driver, in a press briefing, was photographed holding a broken bolt and nut, implying that these parts were a cause of the accident. The small-plane parts were subsequently determined to have been on the ground at the time of the crash, at the former general aviation Ravenswood Airport, a facility that had been out of service for a few years. An owner there had been selling used aircraft parts from a remaining hangar building.|$|E

5|$|There were a {{total of}} twelvetropical storms during the season, fiveof which were unnamed. Of all the storms, fourwere hurricanes. Compared to the average {{activity}} from the previous two decades, the season's activity was below normal despite average sea surface temperatures and a normal number of tropical waves. Instead, the inactivity <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subtropical ridge being located further south than normal, which decreased the atmospheric instability {{across much of the}} basin. Such a pattern was different from the more active 1954 and 1955 seasons. Several tropical depressions formed that did not attain tropical storm status, many of which formed beneath an unfavorable upper-level trough.|$|E
5|$|These acts of {{violence}} were influenced by a desire for revenge and retribution for crimes committed by the Nazis during their invasion of the Soviet Union, collectively driven by Soviet propaganda. The propaganda was a purposeful goad to the Soviet soldier and reflected {{the will of the}} political authorities in the Soviet Union right up to Stalin. There is no question that Stalin was aware of what was happening. Given the strict control of the Communist party over the military hierarchy, the pillage and rape in Prussia <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet command at all levels. Only when Stalin saw that it was in the Soviet Union's interests to check the behaviour of the Red Army did he take steps to stop it.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the first}} award of the GC to an Australian in 1942 {{and the final}} bestowal to Constable Michael Kenneth Pratt in 1978, 14 Australians were {{directly}} decorated with the medal. Of these, nine were awarded to military personnel and five to civilians. Eight of the medals were awarded posthumously. At {{the time of the}} institution of the GC, living recipients of the Empire Gallantry Medal automatically became recipients of the new award, and were required to return their previous medal; two Australians became GC holders through this method. In 1971, the British Government announced that living recipients of the Albert Medal and Edward Medal would henceforth be recipients of the GC with the option of exchanging their insignia for that of the GC. The decision for such an action <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decline in the status and significance of the two awards, leading recipients to feel they were not receiving the recognition they were due. Of the 27 Australian holders of the Albert Medal, six were living at the time and all opted to exchange their insignia for the GC. None of the eight Australians awarded the Edward Medal were alive in 1971, and thus no Australian became a recipient of the GC through this exchange. Including exchange awards, a total of 22 Australians were decorated with the GC.|$|E
