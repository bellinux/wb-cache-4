In an interview with People, Shelton expressed that {{the best part of}} the duet was [...] "the honest way it came about".

500|$|James Arnold Taylor was Tidus' English-language voice. Taylor {{was offered}} the role by voice {{director}} Jack Fletcher (who believed that he would fit the character), and translator Alexander O. Smith explained Tidus to him. In contrast to Morita, Taylor made the character friendlier and less serious with the staff's approval. After recording Final Fantasy X, Taylor {{said that he would}} enjoy voicing Tidus again; the character was [...] "like an old friend to me now. I know so much more about him now than I did <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>first</b> <b>started,</b> knowing hardly anything about him. I would really hate it if anybody else voiced him". Recording the game took Taylor three-and-a-half months, and he enjoyed the experience. According to Taylor, it would be unrealistic for Tidus to hide emotion. He said that although there were things he would change about his performance (such as the scene where Tidus and Yuna begin laughing together), he was grateful for the warm fan reception of his work. Smith felt that the forced-laugh scene was adapted well from the original Japanese scene, because of how [...] "stilted and out of place" [...] it was in the original version. Smith was confused by Morita and Mayuko Aoki's performance, but after discussing it with Nojima he found it well done in both languages and called it [...] "awkward" [...] and [...] "funny". When Final Fantasy X was re-released in 2013, Taylor said that he was proud to be Tidus' voice.|$|E

500|$|Final Destination was {{conceived}} by writers Jeffrey Reddick, James Wong, and Glen Morgan from Flight 180, a spec script {{intended for use}} in The X-Files. The film premiered across the United States and Canada on March 17, 2000, grossing $10,015,822 on its opening weekend and an overall gross of $112,880,294 internationally. The film's success inspired New Line Cinema then-President of Production Toby Emmerich to approach Reddick for a sequel, to which he responded positively. Reddick asserted that he [...] "wanted to expand on the mythology and not just tell the same story over again.” Unfortunately, Wong and Morgan weren't available for production since they had already signed on their respective projects The One and Willard. Instead, New Line hired second unit director and stunt coordinator David R. Ellis as director and writing partners Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber as co-writers. [...] "Second unit is like an extension of directing, you’re doing big action sequences on film {{and it was just}} something I was going after. Once I got the offer from New Line and we got a good script, {{it was kind of a}} natural transition," [...] Ellis professed. [...] "I wanted our film to be able to stand alone but I watched Final Destination to see what they did that was so successful. I tried to use some of that while trying to keep a stand-alone feel for our movie. I kind of took what worked and tried to improve on it," [...] Ellis added. [...] "We wanted to take what the first film did effectively, and add levels and layers that would come out through the characters. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>first</b> <b>started</b> writing this, we were trying to think, 'How can we make Death just a total badass?' and to be perfectly honest, the first crack we ever took at this script had to be reined in!" [...] Bress uncovered. On the other hand, producers Craig Perry and Warren Zide from Zide/Perry Productions also returned and helped on financing the film.|$|E
2500|$|An {{underlying}} {{theme of}} the album, according to Gadhia, is the [...] "feeling of isolation and almost surreal happiness with a lover."

And, yeah, like I said, we were proud of how much we toured. We were-it was a badge of honour to play as much as possible.|$|E

During the same time, Keys was named R&B/Hip-Hop Artist of the Decade by Billboard magazine. When describing the tour, Keys mentions, The show is, obviously, always focused around music; that's what is always my main focus. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>first</b> <b>start</b> putting it all together, it all starts at the music, and then it's what story that I want to tell and kind of what energy I want to give off.

40|$|The {{design of}} future multi-bunch e+e- linear {{collider}} {{is based on}} beams accelerated in very high gradient accelerator structures and having extrernely small beam sizes in the collision point. For preservation of an emittance growth along the linear collider, high resolution and high accuracy BPMs are necessary. The requirements for BPMs in a LC depend on which part of LC they are installed in and do also on many other factors. In main linacs, where the number of BPMs will be around 4000, the cost of BPMs and their electronic circuits and the impedance of the BPM are most important factors. The resolution and accuracy of BPMs in this part should be comparable with the machining accuracy of accelerator structures and will be about 0. 2 - 0. 3 micrometer. It is preferable if some of these BPMs are capable of measuring the beam angle as well. For this purpose, a closed cavity BPM operated at frequency of 6424 MHz was proposed, and calculations and experiments for study of the beam position and angle measurement resolutions were made. In the final focus system, where the beam size {{comes down to a}} few nanometers, the required BPM resolution is about one nanometer and thus a special type of high resolution BPM is needed. This BPM also should be able to identify the position of each bunch in a multi-bunch train. A cavity sensor was proposed, which has a position resolution of about 1 nm. Another type of special cavity sensor was also proposed for measurement of the bunch position in a train relative to each other. To have the required high accelerating gradient along a linac and to produce an energy spread required by the BNS damping, we have to keep the phase between a beam and the RF accelerating voltage within an accuracy of about 1 degree. For many usages, we also need to know the bunch length distribution along a linac. This information is especially important <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>first</b> time <b>start</b> the beam operation. A special phase and bunch length sensor was proposed, which has combined functions of both of them in one device. Calculations and experimental results are presented...|$|R

At that time, there weren't any two bands that sounded alike; these days everyone sounds exactly the same".

60|$|When I had {{rounded the}} bow of the steamer, which {{appeared}} to me to be rapidly settling in the water, I perceived at no great distance several lights, which of course belonged to the other boats, and I rowed as hard as I could, hoping to catch up with them, or at least to keep sufficiently near. It might be my duty to take off {{some of the people who}} had crowded into the other boats, probably supposing that this one had been loaded and gone. How such a mistake could have taken place I could not divine, and it was not my business to do so. Quite certain that no one was left on the sinking steamer, all I had to do was to row after the other boats, and to overtake them as soon as possible. I thought it would not take me very long to do this, but after rowing for half an hour, Mrs. Aleshine remarked that the lights seemed as far off, if not farther, than <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>first</b> <b>started</b> after them. Turning, I saw that this was the case, and was greatly surprised. With only two passengers I ought soon to have come up with those heavily laden boats. But after I had thought over it a little, I considered that as each of them was probably pulled by half a dozen stout sailors, it was not so very strange that they should make as good or better headway than I did.|$|E
