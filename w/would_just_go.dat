500|$|Aki Ross's voice actor, Ming-Na Wen, was {{selected}} for a perceived fit between her personality and Aki's. Ming-Na, who found the role via her publicist, said {{she felt like she}} had given birth with her voice to the character. She gradually accustomed herself to the difficulty of working without the presence and spontaneity of real actors, and commented that the voice-acting work did not take much time, as she <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>go</b> into the studio [...] "once or twice a month for about four months" [...] with no need for make-up and costuming sessions. The workload was so light it did not interfere with her acting commitments in the television series ER.|$|E
500|$|The trio played {{publicly}} {{for the first}} time on July 17 at the Bon Air club—Presley still sporting his child-size guitar. At the end of the month, they appeared at the Overton Park Shell, with Slim Whitman headlining. A combination of his strong response to rhythm and nervousness at playing before a large crowd led Presley to shake his legs as he performed: his wide-cut pants emphasized his movements, causing young women in the audience to start screaming. Moore recalled, [...] "During the instrumental parts, he would back off from the mike and be playing and shaking, and the crowd <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>go</b> wild". Black, a natural showman, whooped and rode his bass, hitting double licks that Presley would later remember as [...] "really a wild sound, like a jungle drum or something".|$|E
500|$|... "Pour Me", {{the last}} soft {{song on the}} album, is a dark ballad that has been often {{compared}} to Eminem's [...] "Stan". Johnny3Tears stated that, [...] "We were messing around with chord progressions and that came out like a more major chord style than we were used to it. It's melodic and poppy sounding. We're talking about drinking obviously because all of us sometimes drink too much. It's one of those basic every day things that people go through but they don't know how to voice it or others around them don't know to voice it. It's almost like you're looked down upon, but no one actually talks about it." [...] "Tendencies", which is the closing track for the standard edition of the album, is a high tempo alternative metal song about murder. Johnny3Tears said, [...] "When we wrote Tendencies, I {{wanted to make a}} song that kids <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>go</b> nuts to when we played it. Kids start moshpits at our shows. Not every song we have is the best mosh song, so I wanted to make a song kids could go crazy for." ...|$|E

2500|$|In contrast, guitarist Joe Satriani enthused: [...] "'Since I've Been Loving You' was {{a perfect}} example of taking a blues {{structure}} but striking out on your own. They were breaking ground, not copying. I love that Page <b>would</b> always <b>just</b> <b>go</b> for it. Some other guitarist might have better technique, but what Page did would always trump it because the spirit was so overwhelming. Whatever he did would turn into a technique." ...|$|R

500|$|Around {{the time}} of Henson's characters' final {{appearances}} on SNL, he began developing two projects featuring the Muppets: a Broadway show and a weekly television series. In 1976, the series was initially rejected by the American networks who believed that Muppets would appeal to only a child audience. Then Henson pitched the show to British impresario Lew Grade to finance the show. The show would be shot in the United Kingdom and syndicated worldwide. That same year, he scrapped plans for his Broadway show and moved his creative team to England, where The Muppet Show began taping. The Muppet Show featured Kermit as host, {{and a variety of}} other memorable characters, notably Miss Piggy, Gonzo the Great, and Fozzie Bear, along with other characters such as Animal. Kermit's role on The Muppet Show was often compared by his co-workers to Henson's role in Muppet Productions: a shy, gentle boss with [...] "A whim of steel" [...] who [...] " [...] things as firmly as it is possible to run an explosion in a mattress factory." [...] Caroll Spinney, the puppet performer of Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch, remembered that Henson [...] "would never say he didn't like something. He <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>go</b> 'Hmm.' That was famous. And if he liked it, he would say, 'Lovely!' [...] " [...] Henson himself recognized Kermit as an alter-ego, though he thought that Kermit was bolder than he; he once said of the character, [...] "He can say things I hold back." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nina Gordon of Veruca Salt, who toured with Hole in 1995, {{recalled}} Love's erratic behavior onstage, saying [...] "She <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>go</b> off and [...] {{would just}} kind of stand there." [...] The majority of Love's chaotic behavior onstage {{was a result of}} heavy drug use at the time, which she admitted: [...] "I was completely high on dope; I cannot remember much about it." [...] She later admonished her behavior during that time, saying: [...] "I [...] pictures of how I looked. It's disgusting. I'm ashamed. There's death and there's disease and there's misery and there's giving up your soul... The human spirit mixed with certain powders is not the person, it's [...] demonic presence." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{for many}} years Mona had made it a {{practice}} to enroll in occasional college-level courses, {{it was in the}} mid 1960s that she completed both a bachelor’s and a master's degree from Queens College. [...] She then taught remedial reading at two Queens elementary schools for eight years. [...] As she recalled, “Every time I would feel mentally stagnant, I <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>go</b> take a course at Hunter or [...] [...] [...] any school downtown. And I loved anthropology, I took a lot of courses in that; I loved psychology and I took a lot of courses in that; anything that I felt like that I wanted to do. So it was not until later years that one of the teachers at Queens College talked me into matriculating. And I’m glad he did because when I did graduate, I graduated magna cum laude.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Travis Fickett of IGN {{opined that}} series creator Josh Friedman had {{apparently}} devoted {{a lot of}} time to imagining the technical aspects of Terminators when this episode touched on such questions as [...] "If [...] were badly damaged and lost their skin [...] how would they continue their mission?" [...] and [...] "If a terminator completed its mission, <b>would</b> it <b>just</b> <b>go</b> into standby?" [...] Fickett also explicitly extolled the special effects in [...] "Heavy Metal", especially as spectacle has been a hallmark of the Terminator films.|$|R

2500|$|Hepburn toured Central America in February 1989, and {{met with}} leaders in Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. In April, she visited Sudan with Wolders {{as part of a}} mission called [...] "Operation Lifeline". Because of civil war, food from aid {{agencies}} had been cut off. The mission was to ferry food to southern Sudan. Hepburn said, [...] "I saw but one glaring truth: These are not natural disasters but man-made tragedies for which there is only one man-made solution – peace." [...] In October 1989, Hepburn and Wolders went to Bangladesh. John Isaac, a UN photographer, said, [...] "Often the kids would have flies all over them, but she <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>go</b> hug them. I had never seen that. Other people had a certain amount of hesitation, but she would just grab them. Children would just come up to hold her hand, touch her – she was like the Pied Piper." ...|$|E
2500|$|Much of the pregame hype {{surrounded}} Super Bowl XIII {{centered around}} Cowboys linebacker Thomas [...] "Hollywood" [...] Henderson. Henderson caused {{quite a stir}} before the NFC Championship Game by claiming that the Rams had [...] "no class" [...] and the Cowboys would shut them out. His prediction {{turned out to be}} very accurate; the Cowboys did shut them out, aided by Henderson's 68-yard interception return for a touchdown. In the days leading up the Super Bowl, Henderson began talking about the Steelers in the same manner. He predicted another shutout and then made unflattering comments about several Pittsburgh players. He put down the talent and the intelligence of Bradshaw, proclaiming [...] "Bradshaw couldn't spell 'cat' if you spotted him the 'c' and the 'a'." [...] But the Steelers refused to get into a war of words with Henderson. Greene responded by saying the Steelers didn't need to say they were the best, they <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>go</b> out on the field and [...] "get the job done.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|When the {{families}} finally meet for the eventual “pamamanhikan” at the palatial Fuentebella residence, what starts as a civilized encounter between two families escalates into a hilarious rich-versus-poor mano-a-mano where Tracy's grandfather (Jaime Fabregas) insulted the Polotan's family, {{a scenario that}} turns the mansion into a madhouse of outlandish proportions which resulted in Rock and Tracy's separation. Rock got depressed and did not leave his room for three days. [...] He was confronted by his mother Rose, saying that life must go on. Rose thinks her son is still young for fatherhood, so she is {{not in favor of}} the marriage. Nick thinks the family would be in shame if Tracy will raise a child with no father, so he wants the wedding to push through as soon as possible. Elaine, who also got pregnant at a young age does not want her daughter to experience a forced marriage and get trapped in a loveless marriage as {{what had happened to her}} and her husband, Nick. Elaine suggested that it would be better if Tracey <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>go</b> to the USA and give birth there, but before Tracy's departure, Rock was able to sneak into Tracy's room, and they elope. The two then sent an MMS to their families stating that they got married in the City hall. The two parties become so depressed because of Rock and Tracey's decision. Elaine seems to be disappointed with Nick. She thinks that Nick is not a good father to Tracy so their daughter grew up to be imperfect person. She decides to leave, but on her way out of the estate, Nick stops her and professes his undying love, stating that it would be best if they will try to start again. On the other hand, Rose and Pol also renew their love. Meanwhile, Brent (Coleta), Rock's best friend who is a closeted gay and is secretly in love with Rock, professes his love when they were drunk but the two remain best friends. In the end, the two families are able to accept the fate of Rock and Tracy who become parents at 19. The movie ends with the cast singing [...] "Pag-Ibig", and [...] "I Do Bidoo Bidoo".|$|E

5000|$|Although it {{has been}} rumored {{that at this point}} the project was {{repurposed}} to be a sequel to the 1985 Arnold Schwarzenegger action film Commando, scriptwriter de Souza has denied this. De Souza has said he wrote the script as if Hans Gruber were the protagonist. [...] "If he had not planned the robbery and put it together, Bruce Willis <b>would</b> have <b>just</b> <b>gone</b> to the party and reconciled or not with his wife.

For those who viewed the movie, however, Spielberg’s story has become history, because “that’s what happened in Auschwitz, and I have seen it myself”. One is reminded of Ronald Reagan, who once was asked if he would have handled the Iran hostage crisis 1 different than Jimmy Carter did.

Shimizu revealed he was offered the chance to direct the sequel but took on the role of producer instead. The film put out a casting call for new actors to play Kayako and Toshio, as Takako Fuji (Kayako) and Yuya Ozeki (Toshio) passed on the opportunity.
