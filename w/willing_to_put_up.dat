The People's Republic of China {{announced that it would}} not be happy if a seeded typhoon changed course and made landfall on its shores, while Japan declared itself <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> with difficulties caused by typhoons because that country got more than half of its rainfall from tropical cyclones.|$|E

According to Bhadrakumar, Pakistan's calculated response following the attack stops short of directly terminating its participation in the war although in essence, this event may push Pakistan's army [...] "within inches of doing that" [...] in the long-term scenario.|$|R

500|$|The early 1980s saw NASCAR's {{popularity}} increase, {{not only}} among fans, but also with sponsors. Companies like Ford, General Motors, Winston and Gatorade were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> advertising dollars and holding auto races became a much more profitable venture. To capitalize on this, the company began pursuing expansion through the purchase of existing tracks. In 1982, the company bought one of the series' most popular and traditional ones, Darlington Raceway {{which has been in}} operation since 1950, as well as Tucson Raceway Park, a [...] dirt oval (since paved) in Arizona. The following year they partnered with Corning Glass Works to purchase the Watkins Glen International road course in upstate New York. In 1987, Bill France, Sr. stepped down as president of the company with Jim France replacing him. Two years later, ISC incorporated its food service company, Americrown.|$|E
500|$|When the Swedish king {{arrived to}} find half {{the city in}} flames and the Danes <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> a fight he had a {{difficult}} decision to make; whether to press forward immediately or to lay siege on the city and try to starve it out. His advisers were divided on the issue, and the king ultimately decided on the latter route. The wisdom of this decision has been questioned, since the Danish defenses were in poor shape initially. However, the population of Copenhagen rallied behind Frederick III, and the walls, moats and other defensive structures of the city were quickly improved. A large number of cannons were brought into the city from ships anchored in the harbor and placed along likely attack routes. The city also had plenty of defensive materiel: [...] of lead, 4,000 muskets, and a staggering [...] of slow match.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1890s, Leno formed a cricket team called the [...] "Dainties", {{for which he}} {{recruited}} many of the day's leading comedians and music hall stars. They played for charity against a variety of amateur teams <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> with their comedic mayhem, such as London's Metropolitan Police Force; Leno's and his teammates' tomfoolery on the green amused the large crowds that they drew. From 1898 to 1903, the Dainties continued to play matches across London. [...] Two films of action from the matches were produced in 1900 for audiences of the new medium of cinema. [...] In September 1901, at a major charity match, the press noted the carnival atmosphere. [...] The comedians wore silly costumes– Leno was dressed as an undertaker and later as a schoolgirl riding a camel. [...] Bands played, and clowns circulated through the crowd. [...] The rival team of professional Surrey cricketers were persuaded to wear tall hats during the match. [...] 18,000 spectators attended, contributing funds for music hall and cricketers' charities, among others.|$|E

500|$|Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club {{praised the}} episode for {{displaying}} some of Leslie's {{stronger and more}} competent aspects, which he said makes audiences [...] "much more <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> with her many, many eccentricities". Heisler {{said he thought the}} Leslie and Justin relationship ended appropriately and praised Ansari's performance, but added he was a little [...] "taken aback" [...] by how rudely Tom treated Wendy. Matt Fowler of IGN said the episode had many funny moments and good character development, but he said some of the romantic relationships risked skewing the balance between [...] "the sweet and the absurd", and that some of the character moments [...] "played out a bit too jarringly real for a show like this". Kona Gallagher of TV Squad said she would like to see Leslie get a boyfriend who last longer than three episodes, unlike Justin Theroux and Louis C.K., who played Leslie's love interest Dave Sanderson earlier in the season. Gallagher praised Andy's band and the befuddlement with which Andy reacted to the senior citizen audience. [...] Mike Murphy of The Press Democrat said the episode was funny, and he particularly praised the [...] "hilariously whacked-out" [...] performance of John Laroquette. Several commentators praised the joke about Andy's new rock song [...] "Sex Hair", about how one can tell whether someone had sex because their hair is matted.|$|E

[...] The only ones who had been <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> the necessary money for him to turn professional were close to underworld figures, and Liston supplemented his income by working for racketeers as an intimidator-enforcer. The connections to organized crime were an advantage early in his career, but were later used [...] against him.|$|E
2500|$|The main Iranian {{forces in}} the region {{consisted}} of the 5th and 12th infantry divisions of 30,000 troops with supporting artillery at Kermanshah and Sanandaj. They were all light infantry (as the mechanised and armour had been stretched thin fighting on multiple fronts). The British reached the outskirts of Shahabad {{in the early morning}} hours of 28 August after delays. At the village of Zibri, they faced a strong Iranian garrison <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> a fight which caused the British several casualties but with poor Iranian leadership and overwhelming British firepower, resistance crumbled and the British took Shahabad on the morning of the same day. By 29 August, the British had reached the town of Kerend and were within [...] of Kermanshah and the Iranian commanders were told of the ceasefire order and stood down. The defenders declared Kermanshah an open city and the British entered on 1 September. They also entered Sanandaj peacefully and eventually Qazvin, which had already been captured by the Red Army.|$|E

2500|$|From Brochu's perspective, {{a salary}} cap was not a major concern for the Expos as {{they could not afford}} to spend the maximum value of any {{negotiated}} cap. But when the strike ended eight months later, by the order of United States federal judge Sonia Sotomayor, the failure to implement strong revenue sharing was a major blow to the Expos. The team had already built a reputation as a penny-pinching organization (Larry Walker once complained in the media that the team asked the players to buy their own vitamins), with the second-lowest payroll in MLB in 1994. Following the strike, the team initiated a fire sale of players: Ken Hill, John Wetteland and Marquis Grissom were traded while Larry Walker was allowed to leave as a free agent. Moisés Alou, Pedro Martínez and Mel Rojas would eventually follow. In his book, My Turn At Bat, Brochu argued that the fire sale was the only viable option, since his partners in the ownership group were not interested in financing the team's losses. Brochu estimated that had he tried to keep the 1994 team together, the Expos would have lost $25 million in 1995, which would have pushed the franchise to the edge of bankruptcy. [...] He claimed that he would have certainly kept Hill, Wetteland, Grissom and Walker had the partners been <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> the money necessary to keep them in Montreal. [...] When Brochu told Malone that Hill, Wetteland, Grissom and Walker all had to go, Malone tried to persuade Brochu to keep at least one of them. [...] It was to no avail; Brochu told Malone that they all had to be off the roster by the deadline for salary arbitration—even though this made it all but impossible to get any leverage in possible deals. [...] As a result, the Expos got almost nothing in return.|$|E
