25|$|<b>We</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> {{exactly how}} Renaissance artists {{thought about the}} Oriental carpets they were depicting. We know that the Venetian Piazza San Marco was adorned with carpets hanging from {{the windows of the}} {{surrounding}} palaces and houses on special occasions. Like the beautiful ladies looking out of the windows, the carpets function as a decorative framework, and highlight the important action which is going on. Similar to the inaccurate pseudo-kufic writing in contemporary paintings, the European artists borrowed something from another culture which they, essentially, did not understand.|$|E
25|$|We {{know our}} human bodies have {{boundaries}} and occupy space, {{the same way}} other objects known only through our named senses do. Though we seldom think of our body as a physical object, we know even before reflection that it shares some of an object's properties. We understand that a watermelon cannot successfully occupy the same space as an oncoming truck; we know that if we tried to repeat the experiment with our own body, we would obtain similar results—we know this even if <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> the physics involved.|$|E

2500|$|According to Picard, {{this feeling}} of {{certainty}} {{may be caused by}} a dysfunction of the anterior insula, a part of the brain which is involved in interoception, self-reflection, and in avoiding uncertainty about the internal representations of the world by [...] "anticipation of resolution of uncertainty or risk". This avoidance of uncertainty functions through the comparison between predicted states and actual states, that is, [...] "signaling that <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand,</b> i.e., that there is ambiguity." [...] Picard notes that [...] "the concept of insight is very close to that of certainty," [...] and refers to Archimedes [...] "Eureka!" [...] Picard hypothesizes that in ecstatic seizures the comparison between predicted states and actual states no longer functions, and that mismatches between predicted state and actual state are no longer processed, blocking [...] "negative emotions and negative arousal arising from predictive uncertainty," [...] which will be experienced as emotional confidence. Picard concludes that [...] "his could lead to a spiritual interpretation in some individuals." ...|$|E

First, we were really surprised. […] At first, <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> really <b>understand</b> why <b>we</b> were {{discussing}} this term.

2500|$|Foscarini sent {{a copy of}} {{his book}} to Bellarmine, who replied in a letter of April 12, 1615. Galileo is {{mentioned}} by name in the letter, and a copy was soon sent to him. [...] After some preliminary salutations and acknowledgements, Bellarmine begins by telling Foscarini that it is prudent for him and Galileo to limit themselves to treating heliocentrism as a merely hypothetical phenomenon and not a physically real one. [...] Further on he says that interpreting heliocentrism as physically real would be [...] "a very dangerous thing, likely not only to irritate all scholastic philosophers and theologians, but also to harm the Holy Faith by rendering Holy Scripture as false." [...] Moreover, while the topic was not inherently a matter of faith, the statements about it in Scripture were so by virtue of who said them—namely, the Holy Spirit. [...] He conceded that if there were conclusive proof, [...] "then one would have to proceed with great care in explaining the Scriptures that appear contrary; and say rather that <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> them, than that what is demonstrated is false." [...] However, demonstrating that heliocentrism merely [...] "saved the appearances" [...] could not be regarded as sufficient to establish that it was physically real. [...] Although he believed that the former may well have been possible, he had [...] "very great doubts" [...] that the latter would be, and in case of doubt it was not permissible to depart from the traditional interpretation of Scriptures. His final argument was a rebuttal of an analogy that Foscarini had made between a moving Earth and a ship on which the passengers perceive themselves as apparently stationary and the receding shore as apparently moving. [...] Bellarmine replied {{that in the case of}} the ship the passengers know that their perceptions are erroneous and can mentally correct them, whereas the scientist on the Earth clearly experiences that it is stationary and therefore the perception that the Sun, moon and stars are moving is not in error and does not need to be corrected.|$|E
