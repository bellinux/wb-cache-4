Some economists (such as Paul Romer) view creativity as an important element in the recombination of elements to produce new technologies and products and, consequently, economic growth. Creativity leads to capital, and creative products are protected by intellectual property laws.|$|E
25|$|The fur trade benefited Indigenous {{people as}} well. They traded furs for metal tools and other European made items that made their lives easier. Knives, pots and kettles, nets, {{firearms}} and hatchets made provided {{improvements in the}} general welfare. At the same time, while their everyday lives were made easier, some traditional <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> <b>things</b> were abandoned or altered, and while Indigenous people embraced many of these implements and tools, they also were exposed to less vital trade goods, such as alcohol and sugar.|$|E
25|$|Evidence-based {{medicine}} is a contemporary movement {{to establish the}} most effective algorithms of practice (<b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> <b>things)</b> {{through the use of}} systematic reviews and meta-analysis. The movement is facilitated by modern global information science, which allows as much of the available evidence as possible to be collected and analyzed according to standard protocols that are then disseminated to healthcare providers. The Cochrane Collaboration leads this movement. A 2001 review of 160 Cochrane systematic reviews revealed that, according to two readers, 21.3% of the reviews concluded insufficient evidence, 20% concluded evidence of no effect, and 22.5% concluded positive effect.|$|E

25|$|In 1692, the Spanish, led by Don Diego de Vargas, reconquered New Mexico. This time colonizers {{were able}} to coexist with the Pueblo Indians. The Spanish {{established}} many communities in which Catholicism and the Spanish language combined with the culture and myths of the Pueblo Indians. New Mexico gained independence from Spain in 1821 and eventually achieved independent statehood in the United States of America in 1912. The mixed cultural influences and {{a long history of}} intermarriage among the Hispanos and the indigenous peoples (i.e.,the mestizaje) remained largely intact throughout rural New Mexico well into the 20th century. The colonization of New Mexico by Spanish colonists resulted, therefore, in a combination of indigenous myths with Catholicism. As the Hispano community's beliefs and <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> <b>things</b> interacted with those of the Native Americans a cultural pattern where indigenous myth maintained importance alongside Catholic doctrine evolved.|$|E

2500|$|Structure {{can act as}} a {{constraint}} on action, but it also enables action by providing common frames of meaning. Consider the example of language: structure of language is represented by the rules of syntax that rule out certain combinations of words. But the structure also provides rules that allow new actions to occur, enabling us to create new, meaningful sentences. Structures should not be conceived as [...] "simply placing constrains upon human agency, but as enabling." [...] (New rules....) Giddens suggests that structures (traditions, institutions, moral codes, and other sets of expectations — established <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> <b>things)</b> are generally quite stable, but can be changed, especially through the unintended consequences of action, when people start to ignore them, replace them, or reproduce them differently.|$|E
2500|$|In The Theory of Business Enterprise, {{which was}} {{published}} in 1904 during the height of American concern with the growth of business combinations and trusts, Veblen employed his evolutionary analysis to explain these new forms. He saw them {{as a consequence of the}} growth of industrial processes in a context of small business firms that had evolved earlier to organize craft production. The new industrial processes impelled integration and provided lucrative opportunities for those who managed it. What resulted was, as Veblen saw it, a conflict between businessmen and engineers, with businessmen representing the older order and engineers as the innovators of new <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> <b>things.</b> In combination with the tendencies described in The Theory of the Leisure Class, this conflict resulted in waste and [...] "predation" [...] that served to enhance the social status of those who could benefit from predatory claims to goods and services.|$|E

We often call those shifts revolutions because people revolt against old and outmoded <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> <b>things</b> in favor of new approaches, new technologies and new ideas that better meet the needs of the time. We have experienced revolutions in information technology, travel and communication.

2500|$|Due {{in part to}} {{the success}} of Hellbilly Deluxe, Zombie {{released}} American Made Music to Strip By in October of 1999. The album was composed solely of remixes of songs featured on Hellbilly Deluxe, featuring contributions from Charlie Clouser and Rammstein, among others. The album was a commercial success in the United States, entering the top forty of the Billboard 200. In 2010, Zombie announced that his fourth studio album would be titled [...] (2010). When asked about the album's title, Zombie was quoted as stating [...] "Well, it was around the ten- year anniversary of the first record, and the idea just popped into my head. It really wasn’t this big master plan by any means, I just knew I wanted to return to the old <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> <b>things,</b> and I thought that {{that would be a good}} starting point." [...] Songs taken from Hellbilly Deluxe were featured in Zombie's retrospective album Past, Present & Future (2003). The album featured songs from both Zombie's work with White Zombie as well as his solo career, along with some new material. Songs from Hellbilly Deluxe would later appear in Zombie's greatest hits collections The Best of Rob Zombie: 20th Century Masters The Millennium Collection (2006) and Icon (2010). Zombie has included songs taken from the album on all of his subsequent tours, including his Hellbilly Deluxe 2 World Tour (2009-12). The music found on the album has been used extensively in the media, including films, video games, and television. [...] "Dragula" [...] and [...] "Superbeast" [...] have been covered by acts such as Motionless In White and Suicide Silence, respectively. The songs [...] "Superbeast", [...] "Dragula", [...] "Living Dead Girl", [...] "Meet the Creeper", [...] "How to Make a Monster", and [...] "Demonoid Phenomenon" [...] were all covered on the tribute album The Electro-Industrial Tribute to Rob Zombie (2002).|$|E
2500|$|Indeed, {{the origin}} of language, {{understood}} as the human capacity of complex symbolic communication, and {{the origin of}} complex culture is often thought to stem from the same evolutionary process in early man. Evolutionary anthropologist Robin I. Dunbar has proposed that language evolved as early humans began to live in large communities which required the use of complex communication to maintain social coherence. Language and culture then both emerged {{as a means of}} using symbols to construct social identity and maintain coherence within a social group too large to rely exclusively on pre-human ways of building community such as for example grooming. Since language and culture are both in essence symbolic systems, twentieth century cultural theorists have applied the methods of analyzing language developed in the science of linguistics to also analyze culture. Particularly the structural theory of Ferdinand de Saussure which describes symbolic systems as consisting of signs (a pairing of a particular form with a particular meaning) has come to be applied widely in the study of culture. But also post-structuralist theories that nonetheless still rely on the parallel between language and culture as systems of symbolic communication, have been applied in the field of semiotics. The parallel between language and culture can then be understood as analog to the parallel between a linguistic sign, consisting for example of the sound [...] and the meaning [...] "cow", and a cultural sign, consisting for example of the cultural form of [...] "wearing a crown" [...] and the cultural meaning of [...] "being king". In this way {{it can be argued that}} culture is itself a kind of language. Another parallel between cultural and linguistic systems is that they are both systems of practice, that is, they are a set of special <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> <b>things</b> that is constructed and perpetuated through social interactions. Children, for example, acquire language in the same way as they acquire the basic cultural norms of the society they grow up in– through interaction with older members of their cultural group.|$|E
