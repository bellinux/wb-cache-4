5|$|In 1974, {{staff at}} Canada Post's Montreal office were noticing a {{considerable}} number of letters addressed to Santa Claus entering the postal system, and those letters were being treated as undeliverable. Since employees handling those letters did not <b>want</b> <b>the</b> writers, mostly young children, to be disappointed at the lack of response, they started answering the letters themselves.|$|E

The band did not <b>want</b> <b>the</b> album to be released outside Japan and wanted full rights to the tapes, but it was released worldwide anyway.|$|E

5|$|A {{central part}} of the show's premise was that the main {{character}} would be handicapped. The initial idea was for House to use a wheelchair, but Fox turned down this interpretation (for which the crew was later grateful). The wheelchair idea turned into a scar on House's face, which later turned into a bad leg necessitating use of a cane. The original script called for House to be 34 years old; however, Shore later explained that he did not <b>want</b> <b>the</b> character to be that young.|$|E
5|$|A patient's genome {{may include}} an {{inherited}} or random mutation which affects {{the probability of}} developing a disease in the future. For example, Lynch syndrome is a genetic disease that predisposes patients to colorectal and other cancers; early detection can lead to close monitoring that improves the patient's chances of a good outcome. Cardiovascular risk is indicated by biological markers and screening can measure the risk that a child will be born with a genetic disease such as Cystic fibrosis. Genetic testing is ethically complex: patients may not <b>want</b> <b>the</b> stress of knowing their risk. In countries without universal healthcare, a known risk may raise insurance premiums.|$|E
5|$|A {{project group}} {{with members of}} the Norwegian Public Roads Administration and the National Rail Administration have {{proposed}} that instead of rebuilding the Ulriken Tunnel to double track, a new double-track light rail tunnel could be built from the city center to Arna. This would allow the light rail line to replace the two-station Bergen Commuter Rail service, and give better access to the city center for people from Arna. Several politicians, including the majority in Hordaland County Council, have stated {{that in the long run}} they <b>want</b> <b>the</b> light rail line extended northwards to Knarvik and westwards to Straume and Kleppestø.|$|E

I <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> color black {{because it is the}} absence of color. I <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> color white because it is the combination of all colors. And I <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> color red because it represents the one thing that all people have in common: blood. I wanted suns instead of stars because stars to me imply searching, like you search for your star. And there are already too many stars in this world. But the sun, that's something that is always there, looking right at you. Betsy Ross did the best she could with what she had. I thought I could do better." ...|$|R

5|$|After Marge leaves Bart with Nelson, Bart discovers two {{eggs in a}} bird's nest. Since he {{does not}} <b>want</b> <b>the</b> babies to die like their mother, he decides to hatch the eggs, and {{secretly}} keeps the eggs warm in his treehouse. After Bart spends more time in his treehouse, Marge starts to suspect he is up to something. After Marge finds out what Bart has been doing, she tells him she is proud of him. With Marge's help, the eggs eventually hatch, but the Simpson family is shocked when instead of birds, a pair of lizards emerge from the eggs, whom Bart names Chirpy Boy and Bart Jr.|$|E
5|$|Agents Scully and Doggett {{arrive at}} the {{operations}} center to investigate. However, they are rudely greeted by Deputy Chief Karras and Lieutenant Bianco of the transit police; the two eagerly <b>want</b> <b>the</b> FBI {{to get the job}} done fast in order that subways can be reopened in five hours, and Karras is also irritated that Scully performed an autopsy on the body. Even after an autopsy, Scully has no idea what killed the man, and the CDC is unable to find any biological or chemical agents in the subway.|$|E
5|$|Broun's scheme had envisaged the {{cemetery}} running along {{both sides of}} the LSWR main line and divided by religion, with separate private railway halts on the main line, each incorporating a chapel, to serve each religion's section. The new consulting engineer to the company, William Cubitt, rejected this idea and recommended a single site to the south of the railway line, served by a private branch line through {{the cemetery}}. The company also considered Broun's plan for dedicated coffin trains unrealistic, arguing that relatives would not <b>want</b> <b>the</b> coffins to be shipped separately from the deceased's family.|$|E

5|$|Burton Pynsent House is a {{historic}} country-house in Britain, situated in the parish of Curry Rivel, Somerset, England. It is a Grade II* listed building. The house was built in stages between 1565 and 1765, when it was bequeathed to William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham by William Pynsent, who did not <b>want</b> <b>the</b> house to go to Lord North. Pitt had an additional wing built to a design by Lancelot Brown, and the subsequent owner demolished everything but this wing in 1805.|$|E
5|$|CG {{was also}} used to {{recreate}} the San Francisco neighborhood at Washington and Cherry Streets where cab driver Paul Stine was killed. The area had changed significantly {{over the years and}} residents didn't <b>want</b> <b>the</b> murder to be re-created in their neighborhood, so Fincher shot the six-minute sequence on a bluescreen stage. Production designer Donald Burt gave the visual effects team detailed drawings of the intersection as it was in 1969. Photographs of every possible angle of the area were shot with a high-resolution digital camera, allowing the effects crew to build computer-based geometric models of homes that were then textured with period facades. 3-D vintage police motorcycles, squad cars, a firetruck and street lights were added to the final shot.|$|E
5|$|Cook and Lemish {{speculate}} that the 610 Office was created outside the traditional state-based security system for several reasons: first, a number of officials within the military and security agencies were practicing Falun Gong, leading Jiang and other CPC leaders to fear that these organizations had already been quietly compromised; second, {{there was a need}} for a nimble and powerful organization to coordinate the anti-Falun Gong campaign; third, the creation of a top-level party organization sent a message down the ranks that the anti-Falun Gong campaign was a priority; and finally, CPC leaders did not <b>want</b> <b>the</b> anti-Falun Gong campaign to be hindered by legal or bureaucratic restrictions, and thus established the 610 Office extrajudicially.|$|E

5|$|Executive {{producer}} and co-writer George Lucas {{decided to make}} the film a prequel as he did not <b>want</b> <b>the</b> Nazis to be the villains again. After three rejected plot devices, Lucas wrote a film treatment that resembled the film's final storyline.

5|$|Gloucester's {{precarious}} {{health was}} {{a constant source of}} worry to his mother. His death, in 1700 at the age of eleven, precipitated a succession crisis as his mother was the only individual remaining in the Protestant line of succession established by the Bill of Rights 1689. The English Parliament did not <b>want</b> <b>the</b> throne to revert to a Catholic, and so passed the Act of Settlement 1701, which settled the throne of England on Electress Sophia of Hanover, a cousin of King James II, and her Protestant heirs.|$|E
5|$|However, the King did not <b>want</b> <b>the</b> house himself, and {{he offered}} it to his heir-apparent, Beatrice's nephew George, who declined, objecting to {{the high cost of}} maintenance.

Shortly afterwards, the King declared to Arthur Balfour, the Prime Minister, that the main house would go to the nation as a gift. An exception was made for the private apartments, which were closed to all but the royal family members, who made it a shrine to their mother's memory.|$|E

The Jack Russell Terrier Breeders Association formed and petitioned the AKC; the breed's admission was granted in 2001.
