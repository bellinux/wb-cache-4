5|$|Mamie Till Bradley {{testified that}} she had {{instructed}} her son to <b>watch</b> <b>his</b> manners in Mississippi and that should a situation ever come to his being asked to get on his knees to ask forgiveness of a white person, he should do it without a thought. The defense questioned her identification of her son in the casket in Chicago and a $400 life insurance policy she had taken out on him.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the tour}} was over, Weinberg {{said he would}} {{continue}} to appear with his various own bands, including doing weddings and bar and bat mitzvahs just as he had earlier in his career. He also liked to <b>watch</b> <b>his</b> son Jay play with Slipknot, although he conceded he did so from a safe zone where he would not get knocked down by the audience.|$|E

5|$|Samaras {{was born}} in Heraklion, {{the capital city of}} the Greek island of Crete. His {{favourite}} footballer growing up was Marco van Basten. Samaras was also a keen basketball fan and his father, Ioannis Samaras, often let him stay up until {{the early hours of the}} morning so he could <b>watch</b> <b>his</b> hero Michael Jordan.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy {{was spotted}} by Arsenal playing for New Hartley Juniors, {{and though the}} scouts had {{initially}} gone to the game to <b>watch</b> <b>his</b> striker partner Watts, Kennedy had impressed enough to win an apprentice contract with Arsenal in May 1968. He then signed professional forms with the club in November 1968. He had a difficult task though to win a first team place, as manager Bertie Mee used only 15 players throughout the entire 1968–69 season, during which time Kennedy made 20 appearances for the Reserve team as they claimed the Football Combination Division One title.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{scheduled}} {{to report to}} prison on March 18, Farmer was granted a one-week delay by Van Tatenhove to <b>watch</b> <b>his</b> son, Trey, play for Clay County High School in the KHSAA basketball tournament. Clay County lost that game to Covington Catholic High School 80-78 {{in the first round}} of the tournament. Covington Catholic went on to win the KHSAA State Championship. Van Tatenhove insisted that he granted the delay in deference to the Farmer family, not as a special favor for Farmer himself. On March 25, 2014, Farmer reported to the satellite camp of the Hazelton prison to begin serving his sentence. He was imprisoned for almost 20 months, transitioned to a halfway house in Lexington on December 18, 2015, and was released on January 21, 2016.|$|E

5|$|Reluctant to give Rupert back to Stewie, Stanford Cordray (the buyer, {{voiced by}} Rob Lowe) {{and his family}} {{organize}} a skiing race down the mountain, so if Stewie is the first down, {{they are allowed to}} take Rupert away with them and if Stanford wins, he can have Brian. Stewie cheats by installing rockets in his skis, and relaxes to <b>watch</b> <b>his</b> progress. Stewie then crashes into a tree and loses the race. He tells Brian that maybe this means he should give up Rupert, but he proceeds to grab Rupert after telling his personal butler Crohn to throw a cup of hot tea on the child's face, forcing him to drop the bear. The two make a run for it before the child's parents notice, then realize they still {{need to get back to}} Quahog (which, by looking at a highway sign at the end, is 2112 miles away, a reference to the Rush 1976 album), so they carjack a passing driver in the city and drive home.|$|E
5|$|After graduating, Dawkins did a post {{graduate}} {{year at the}} New Hampton School in New Hampton, New Hampshire where he averaged 12.3 points and 3.6 rebounds before receiving a late scholarship offer from Michigan. His grades were not sufficient to pursue a scholarship at Stanford and despite his relationship with Chris Collins, Northwestern {{was not interested in}} Dawkins given their commitments from wings Vic Law and Scottie Lindsey. While at New Hampton, he was being recruited by Steve Donahue of Boston College, but Donahue left Boston College in 2014 and recommended Dawkins to Beilein. Before Michigan stepped in, it appeared that he would have committed to Dayton, although he was also considering Utah State, Pepperdine as well as Montana, and Rhode Island was showing a strong interest. In fact, during the 2014 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, Dawkins attended the Sweet 16 round to <b>watch</b> <b>his</b> father's Stanford Cardinal play Dayton in the South Regional on March 27. Dawkins accepted a recruiting visit to Michigan in early April 2014 when he received his scholarship offer. He made his verbal commitment on April 28 and signed his National Letter of Intent on May 9.|$|E
5|$|At the 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam, Nurmi {{competed in}} three events. He won the 10,000 m by staying right behind Ritola until sprinting past {{him on the}} home straight. Before the 5000 m final, Nurmi injured himself in his {{qualifying}} heat for the 3000 m steeplechase. He fell on his back at the water jump, spraining his hip and foot. Lucien Duquesne stopped to help him up, and Nurmi thanked the Frenchman by pacing him past the field and offered him the heat win, which Duquesne gracefully refused. In the 5000 m, Nurmi tried to repeat his move on Ritola but had to <b>watch</b> <b>his</b> teammate pull away instead. Nurmi, looking more exhausted than ever before, only barely managed to keep Wide behind and take silver. Nurmi had little time to rest or nurse his injuries as the 3000 m steeplechase started the next day. Struggling with the hurdles, Nurmi let Finland's steeplechase specialist Toivo Loukola escape into the distance. On the final lap, he sprinted clear of the others and finished nine seconds behind the world-record setting Loukola; Nurmi's time also bettered the previous record. Although Ritola did not finish, Ove Andersen completed a Finnish sweep of the medals.|$|E

5|$|Before his death, Mr. Nobody {{tells the}} {{journalist}} {{that neither of}} them exist. They are figments {{in the mind of}} the 9-year-old Nemo at the train station, as he was forced to make an impossible choice. The young boy tries to find the correct decision, following each choice to its conclusion. Eventually, the boy takes a third option: to not make the choice at all. He leaves both parents and runs away towards an unknown future. This ambiguous choice somehow leads to him and Anna reuniting happily. The film returns to old Nemo on his death bed. The calculated time arrives and Mr. Nobody's last words are watched by the world. The expansion of the universe comes to a halt and time appears to reverse. The universe ceases to dissipate, and finally begins contracting. Consequently, Nemo's life simplifies itself. He is able to return to his childhood, <b>watch</b> <b>his</b> parents get back together and be with Anna. The 118-year-old man cackles triumphantly as he springs back into awareness with the realization that his younger self has finally found his one true love and life.|$|E
