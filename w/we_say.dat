The coupling constant runs to infinity at finite energy, signalling a Landau pole. The problem is essentially that QED appears to suffer from quantum triviality issues.

50|$|Many medieval {{philosophers}} {{made use}} {{of the idea of}} approaching a knowledge of God through negative attributes. For example, <b>we</b> should not <b>say</b> that God exists in the usual sense of the term, all <b>we</b> can safely <b>say</b> is that God is not nonexistent. <b>We</b> should not <b>say</b> that God is wise, but <b>we</b> can <b>say</b> that God is not ignorant (i.e. in some way God has some properties of knowledge). <b>We</b> should not <b>say</b> that God is One, but we can state that there is no multiplicity in God's being.|$|R

50|$|An apple {{sitting on}} a table is in a {{relation}} to the table it sits on.

Being-taller-than is a relation between the two structures. <b>We</b> can <b>say</b> that that relation has being as well. This, too, is a point of contention in the problem of universals.|$|R

5000|$|The American {{physicist}} J.

The Buddha has given such answers when interrogated as to the conditions of man's self after his death; but they are not familiar answers for the tradition of seventeenth and eighteenth-century science.|$|R

25|$|A {{function}} with these three properties {{is sometimes called}} bicontinuous. If such a function exists, <b>we</b> <b>say</b> X and Y are homeomorphic. A self-homeomorphism is a homeomorphism of a topological space and itself. The homeomorphisms form an equivalence relation on the class of all topological spaces. The resulting equivalence classes are called homeomorphism classes.|$|E

25|$|It's a rare gift {{which sets}} Irving Berlin apart {{from all other}} {{contemporary}} songwriters.

25|$|Even in curved space, Minkowski {{space is}} still a good {{description}} in an infinitesimal region surrounding any point (barring gravitational singularities). More abstractly, <b>we</b> <b>say</b> that {{in the presence of}} gravity spacetime is described by a curved 4-dimensional manifold for which the tangent space to any point is a 4-dimensional Minkowski space. Thus, the structure of Minkowski space is still essential in the description of general relativity.|$|E

As Thomson reminds, the house belongs to the mother; similarly, the body which holds a fetus also belongs to the mother.|$|E
