This paper describes the evaluation of the performance of distributed <b>wavelength</b> provisioning in wavelengthdivision -multiplexing (WDM) optical networks with sparse <b>wavelength</b> conversion (i. e., where <b>wavelength</b> conversion is available at only a subset of network nodes). Using the well-known destination -initiated reservation method as a case study, a highly accurate analytical model supported by comprehensive simulation validation is proposed. Both analytical and simulation results show that, in optical networks with distributed <b>wavelength</b> provisioning, sparse <b>wavelength</b> conversion still helps to significantly lower the connection-blocking probabilities. However, unlike that in centralized <b>wavelength</b> provisioning, sparse <b>wavelength</b> conversion may not easily achieve nearly the same performance as that of full <b>wavelength</b> conversion, especially under light traffic loads. This paper evaluates how the potential contribution of sparse <b>wavelength</b> conversion depends on different factors, such as the number of <b>wavelength</b> converters, the number of <b>wavelength</b> channels per fiber, the burstiness of traffic loads, and the network size, and discusses the influence of the signaling scheme...|$|R

5|$|Green {{is common}} in nature, as many plants are green because of a complex {{chemical}} known as chlorophyll, which is involved in photosynthesis. Chlorophyll absorbs the long <b>wavelengths</b> of light (red) and short <b>wavelengths</b> of light (blue) much more efficiently than the <b>wavelengths</b> that appear green to the human eye, so light reflected by plants is enriched in green. Chlorophyll absorbs green light poorly because it first arose in organisms living in oceans where purple halobacteria were already exploiting photosynthesis.

The new organisms that then later came to dominate the extraction of light were selected to exploit those portions of the spectrum not used by the halobacteria.|$|E
