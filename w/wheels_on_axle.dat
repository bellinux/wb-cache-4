30|$|For {{differential}} braking control: (1) In general, to prevent rollover or oversteer accidents, braking <b>on</b> outside <b>wheels</b> <b>on</b> <b>axles</b> {{in front of}} the CG point can generate a larger extra yaw moment than <b>on</b> rear <b>axles.</b> (2) To prevent understeering, braking <b>on</b> the inside <b>wheels</b> <b>on</b> <b>axles</b> after the CG point can generate better effects than braking <b>on</b> the front <b>axles.</b> (3) The largest yaw moment changes generated by braking <b>on</b> each <b>wheel</b> are limited not only by initial forces of the tires, ability of air braking system, and steering angle but also by distances between the axles and CG position. (4) In terms of braking wheel, when the root of the quadratic sum of braking force and lateral force is equal to the radius of Kammâ€™s Circle, braking <b>wheels</b> <b>on</b> the rear <b>axle</b> need a complex control logic. When the truck is in the danger of drifting, braking <b>on</b> front <b>axles</b> is a better choice.|$|R

In North America and in some other countries the type was usually known as the Mastodon and sometimes as the Twelve-wheeler.|$|R
25|$|One of the <b>wheels</b> <b>on</b> each <b>axle</b> was {{insulated}} from the axle with vulcanized fiber.|$|R
50|$|Under the Whyte {{notation}} for {{the classification}} of steam locomotives, 2-2-2 represents the wheel arrangement of two leading <b>wheels</b> <b>on</b> one <b>axle,</b> two powered driving <b>wheels</b> <b>on</b> one <b>axle,</b> and two trailing <b>wheels</b> <b>on</b> one <b>axle.</b> The <b>wheel</b> arrangement both provided more stability and enabled a larger firebox than the earlier 0-2-2 and 2-2-0 types. This configuration was introduced in 1834 on Robert Stephenson's 'Patentee locomotive' but it was later popularly named Jenny Lind, after the Jenny Lind locomotive which in turn was named after the popular singer.
