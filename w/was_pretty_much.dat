5|$|Kidd {{was both}} {{director}} and choreographer for the musical comedy film Merry Andrew (1958), starring Danny Kaye. By the then {{the era of}} movie musicals <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> over, and Kidd {{turned his attention to}} Broadway, where he had continued to work while choreographing movies. At the same time that he was choreographing The Band Wagon he was staging dances for Cole Porter’s Broadway musical Can-Can. In that show he created dance numbers for Gwen Verdon which helped make her a Broadway sensation.|$|E
5|$|And by {{the time}} they got it all {{organized}} and figured out, there were really only a couple of songs left for me to do anything on. So I came into L.A. for a couple of days and Kasim... came in, as was the routine, and we did maybe three songs... just so that I’d have a few fingerprints on the record. I think someone, maybe Meat Loaf, said that to keep everything covered, I had to be in there somewhere... but not necessarily running the whole thing. So my involvement <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> peripheral.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Smoking Man was an {{aspiring}} writer of espionage (and later, science-fiction) novels starring a fictional version of himself, Jack Colquitt, {{and based on}} his own secret activities, but all his drafts were rejected or altered by publishers who found them unrealistic and poorly written. This left him {{no choice but to}} continue working for the United States government. By 1991, the Smoking Man's power <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> absolute. He was in direct talks with Saddam Hussein and involved {{in one way or another}} on the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas controversy, moving the Rodney King trial to Simi Valley, keeping the US government from interferring in the independence of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Academy Awards nominations, keeping the Buffalo Bills from ever winning the Super Bowl, drugging the Soviet goalkeeper before the Miracle on Ice, and executing extraterrestrials that survived landing on American soil.|$|E

Swinton stated after the film's release: [...] "Jim <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> nocturnal, so the nightscape <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> his palette.

25|$|Until the 1950s, {{the whole}} family seated around a set {{in the living room}} was the typical way of {{listening}} to radio. Stations tried to {{be all things to all}} people, and specialised programming was not really thought about at this stage (it did not come in until the late 1950s). Because of this, programming on most stations <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> the same.|$|E
25|$|After 1931, however, Foster <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> lost {{to county}} cricket, playing a single match for Warwickshire {{in each of}} the next three seasons, and then not at all. In 1932, his one game was the fixture against Kent, and he took five for 81 and six for 82 to achieve a 10-wicket-match for the only time in his career. That same season he also played for a third time in the Gentlemen v Players fixture at The Oval, a batsmen's feast with 1074 runs scored for the loss of only 18 wickets.|$|E

25|$|From 1902 to 1908, Odell <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> an ever-present in the Leicestershire {{side and}} the leading wicket-taker in several of those seasons, though he also {{appeared}} for other amateur teams, including London County and five times for Gentlemen in the series of matches between amateurs and professionals. In 1902, he took 89 wickets in games {{at an average of}} 26.41. They included seven Hampshire wickets for 33 runs, which remained his best bowling figures for four years. In his first ever match for London County in 1902, he took six second innings wickets against MCC, including Arthur Conan Doyle for a duck.|$|E
25|$|In Japan, he was penalised five grid {{places for}} failing to slow down for yellow flags after Sébastien Buemi crashed, {{scattering}} debris onto the track. The R29's pace was again disappointing, when he could only manage to climb up to 10th from 16th place on the grid, despite a late safety car period after Jaime Alguersuari crashed heavily. Alonso said that his race <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> decided in qualifying, although he admitted that his car seemed to be fairly competitive. In Brazil however, he retired on the first lap when Adrian Sutil and Jarno Trulli collided, and Alonso was unable to avoid the out-of-control Force India, which had spun onto the wet grass, terminally damaging a sidepod on Alonso's car, forcing him to retire.|$|E
25|$|General Electric {{acquired}} RCA in 1986, {{and with}} it NBC, signaling {{the beginning of the}} end of NBC Radio. Three factors led to the radio division's demise: GE decided that radio did not fit its strategy, while the radio division had not been profitable for many years. In addition, FCC ownership rules at the time prevented companies acquiring broadcast properties from owning both a radio and television division. In the summer of 1987, GE sold NBC Radio's network operations to Westwood One, and sold off the NBC-owned stations to various buyers. By 1990, the NBC Radio Network as an independent programming service <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> dissolved, becoming a brand name for content produced by Westwood One, and ultimately by, ironically, CBS Radio. The Mutual Broadcasting System, which Westwood One had acquired two years earlier, met the same fate, and essentially merged with NBC Radio.|$|E

25|$|It {{seemed that}} no one in the Channel Nine box could make a comment about him that wasn't negative. His feet, hands, {{technique}} and temperament were questioned. His second-innings 46 was not enough. And they weren't always wrong. It just seemed kind of mean. Especially when at the back of the press box some seemed happy when he was out. But it went deeper than McNamara's comments. Bailey had made mistakes in his career. He hadn't made enough first-class runs. He hadn't come into the team as a young man. He came into the captaincy without playing a game. He came into the Test team because of one-day runs. He was everything old-school cricket didn't like. A thinking cricketer who had never demanded inclusion, but who had been included regardless. For old-school types like Ian Chappell, he <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> everything he didn't like. And Chappell wasn't just turning on Bailey because of his stoush with Channel Nine. He had not liked Bailey for a long time.|$|E
25|$|Ahead {{of their}} first final against {{cross-town}} rivals the Giants, the Swans confirmed that they would play all home finals at the SCG except for Sydney Derbies, which would be played at ANZ Stadium. The final would create history, being the first Sydney Derby to be played in a final. It {{was also the first}} time that the Giants would make the finals in their fifth year. In a low-scoring first half, the Swans were very competitive, trailing by only 2 points. However, a mark not paid to Isaac Heeney midway through the third quarter turned all the momentum the Giants way, as they kicked away to win by 36 points. The Swans only kicked 2 goals after half-time with Giant Jeremy Cameron outscoring them in the third quarter alone with 3 goals. They were quick to bounce back the following week, thumping the Adelaide Crows by 6 goals, with Franklin and Tom Papley kicking 4 goals a piece, after a blistering 7 goal to 1 quarter. The story <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> the same in the preliminary final against the Geelong Cats at the MCG. The Swans kept the Cats goalless for the first quarter, and were never really challenged in their 37-point triumph. It would take them to their third grand final in 5 years, against the Western Bulldogs at the MCG. After leading by a scant 2 point margin at half time, the Bulldogs pulled away towards the end of the fourth quarter to hand Sydney their second grand final loss in three years.|$|E

500|$|Moore emailed {{his work}} back to Matheos, who was [...] "pleasantly surprised" [...] {{to be sent}} {{something}} completely different from what he expected. Matheos {{wanted to create a}} heavy album; before deciding to takes Moore's ideas further, Matheos and Moore wrote what would become [...] "OSI". Moore said that after that, [...] " [...] <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> comfortable with whatever I wanted to do." [...] This new song format was very different from what Portnoy and Matheos originally planned: the already-written long tracks were split into multiple short songs, closer to Moore's project Chroma Key than traditional progressive metal. [...] "The Thing That Never Was", a track on the bonus disc, shows the direction Matheos and Portnoy originally planned to take the album in.|$|E
500|$|According to Brungardt, the {{recording}} of the project's earlier songs, [...] "Heart Attack", was critical in their decision for the album. The song was recorded during Saadiq's break from touring for The Way I See It and had originally featured that album's sound, {{with which they were}} not satisfied. When they revisited the song, Saadiq reconstructed the original recording after stripping track's individually recorded instrument parts, {{with the exception of the}} vocals and some of its drums. In an interview for EQ Magazine, Brungardt said of their approach, [...] "We wanted to evolve the songs, and I wanted to evolve the engineering, as well. On The Way I See It, everything <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> tube pre's and tube compressors. On this one, I wanted to play around with some of the more solid-state gear".|$|E
