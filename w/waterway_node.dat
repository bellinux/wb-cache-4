40|$|One of the {{significant}} limitations of inland waterway transport on the Oder River is the water level. Its variability determines the minimum clearance under the bridges and thus the maximum drought of moving vessels. An important factor affecting the water level in the Oder River is the phenomenon of wind backwater. Certain pressure field distribution situations may affect in an increase of water level on the coast and thereby block the outflow of river waters. In this paper {{an example of the}} limitations of inland navigation in the estuarine part of the Lower Oder under the weather conditions on the southern Baltic Sea in autumn 2016 is presented. For the analysis area of Szczecin <b>Waterway</b> <b>Node</b> and section of Oder River from Szczecin to Gryfino was chosen. Based on data the weather and navigational conditions of the area of the Lower Oder were assessed. Occurring winds, currents and changes in water level has been analyzed. In the situations of unfavorable raise of the water level in the river, inland navigation is redirected to the section of Regalica River, and a section of the port of Szczecin region is closed. This causes obvious difficulties and results in prolonged ships routes. Additional obstacle that take place here is an arbitrarily determined time of railway bridge span lifting in Szczecin Podjuchy...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In transportation, {{capacity}} {{has traditionally}} been measured at individual elements of the network, such as links (rail lines, road segments and <b>waterway</b> etc.) and <b>nodes</b> (terminals and signalized intersection, etc.). These measures do not constitute the transportation network capacity. Recently, Wong and Yang (1997) proposed the concept of network reserve capacity to estimate the transportation network capacity, but the concept is restricted to a common multiplier for all O-D pairs. In this study, the concepts of ultimate capacity and practical capacity (with a non-uniform O-D growth) are applied to the transportation problem to relax the limitation of the reserve capacity concept; thus, the concepts can yield information regarding the spatial distribution of the demand pattern. The definitions of three different network capacity concepts and their models will be described. The analysis of network capacity for three different concepts is provided to demonstrate their features...|$|R
