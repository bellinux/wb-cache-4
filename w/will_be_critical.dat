25|$|Climate {{change has}} the {{potential}} to affect agriculture through changes in temperature, rainfall (timing and quantity), CO2, solar radiation and the interaction of these elements. Extreme events, such as droughts and floods, are forecast to increase as climate change takes hold. Agriculture is among sectors most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change; water supply for example, <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>critical</b> to sustain agricultural production and provide the increase in food output required to sustain the world's growing population. Fluctuations in the flow of rivers are likely to increase in the twenty-first century. Based on the experience of countries in the Nile river basin (Ethiopia, Kenya and Sudan) and other developing countries, depletion of water resources during seasons crucial for agriculture can lead to a decline in yield by up to 50%. Transformational approaches will be needed to manage natural resources in the future. For example, policies, practices and tools promoting climate-smart agriculture will be important, as will better use of scientific information on climate for assessing risks and vulnerability. Planners and policy-makers will need to help create suitable policies that encourage funding for such agricultural transformation.|$|E

500|$|Despite having {{details of}} its launch {{announced}} at an SNP political event, the newspaper {{has stated that}} it is politically independent of that party. Its inaugural editorial says that being a mouthpiece for the party [...] "would not be a healthy course to follow. We <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>critical</b> where appropriate and complimentary when merited." [...] But in The Guardian, Brooks suggested that launching The National at an SNP political rally [...] "might {{not have been the}} most auspicious of starts" [...] for the newspaper, while Labour peer George Foulkes quickly dubbed it [...] "McPravda", a reference to the political newspaper associated with the Communist Party of Russia. Damian Thompson, an associate editor with The Spectator, described the launch event as [...] "creepy". McIvor wrote that the calibre of its stablemates together with a respected editor had ensured The National was being taken seriously in political and media circles, but that the onus was on it to prove its credibility as a publication that supports independence rather than being viewed as [...] "a propaganda organ, a cynical business exercise or the old media equivalent of some pro-independence websites". Alan Roden, political editor of the Scottish Daily Mail, claimed it had [...] "rehashed SNP press releases" [...] and was too expensive for its size.|$|E
