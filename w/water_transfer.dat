40|$|A {{necessary}} {{precursor to}} irrigated agriculture in southern Alberta is {{the availability of}} massive quantities of water. Many suggest that water demand will rise substantially in the decades to come. These projections also come {{at a time of}} increasing environmental awareness in Alberta, leading some to advocate that more water should be secured for environmental purposes. The Alberta government enabled inter-sectoral <b>water</b> <b>transfers</b> as a way to re-allocate water in order to satisfy growing demand. This has raised skepticism among the irrigation community over the use of <b>water</b> <b>transfers</b> as a way to satisfy future demand. The research presented in this thesis approaches this issue by examining the factors that influence irrigators’ perceptions towards using <b>water</b> <b>transfers</b> as a way to re-allocate water to other uses. The findings reveal that if the government is relying on <b>water</b> <b>transfers</b> as the primary way to re-allocate water in the future, it must address irrigators’ skepticism, and create conditions that promote transfers as a preferable option...|$|R
40|$|The American West faces many challenges, {{but none}} is more {{important}} than the challenge of managing its water. This book examines the role that <b>water</b> <b>transfers</b> can play in allocating the region's scarce water resources. It focuses on the variety of third parties, including Native Americans, Hispanic communities, rural communities, and the environment, that can sometimes be harmed when water is moved. The committee presents recommendations to guide states, tribes, and federal agencies toward better regulation. Seven in-depth case studies are presented: Nevada's Carson-Truckee basin, the Colorado Front Range, northern New Mexico, Washington's Yakima River basin, central Arizona, and the Central and Imperial valleys in California. <b>Water</b> <b>Transfers</b> in the West presents background and current information on factors that have encouraged <b>water</b> <b>transfers,</b> typical types of transfers, and their potential negative effects. The book highlights the benefits that <b>water</b> <b>transfers</b> can bring but notes the need for more third-party representation in the processes used to evaluate planned transfers...|$|R

The copious amount {{of water from the}} Ubangi would revitalize the dying Lake Chad and provide livelihood in fishing and enhanced agriculture to tens of millions of central Africans and Sahelians. Inter-basin <b>water</b> <b>transfer</b> schemes were proposed in the 1980s and 1990s by Nigerian engineer J. Umolu (ZCN Scheme) and Italian firm Bonifica (Transaqua Scheme). In 1994, the Lake Chad Basin Commission (LCBC) proposed a similar project and at a March, 2008 Summit, the Heads of State of the LCBC member countries committed to the diversion project. In April, 2008, the LCBC advertised a request for proposals for a World Bank-funded feasibility study.|$|E
25|$|During the French Protectorate, {{beginning}} in 1912, {{water supply and}} sanitation in many large cities in Morocco were managed under a concession to the private company Société Marocaine de Distribution d'eau, de gaz et d'electricité (SMD). SMD, a consortium led by Lyonnaise des Eaux, provided services in Casablanca, Rabat, Salé, Tangiers and Meknes. Since 1950 SMD also managed a vital bulk <b>water</b> <b>transfer</b> project: The supply of water from the Oum er-Rbia river to Casablanca. Bulk water supply to other cities that were not able to supply themselves from local water sources was a responsibility of a public company called Régie d'exploitation industrielle du protectorat (REIP) created in the early 1930s. The foundations for two important elements of today's water and sanitation sector - private concessions for water distribution in large cities and a national public company for bulk water supply - were thus already laid during the protectorate.|$|E
25|$|Morocco {{is divided}} in seven major river basins {{and a number}} of smaller basins. The seven major basins from North to South are the Loukkos River, the Moulouya River, the Sebou River, the Bou Regreg River, the Oum Er-Rbia River, the Tensift River and the Souss-Massa basin. Except for the Loukkos River, all these rivers {{originate}} in the Atlas Mountains.There are few inter-basin transfers in Morocco, the most important ones being the Rocade canal from the Oum Er-Rbia basin to the Tensift basin near Marrakesh, a transfer from near the mouth of the Oum er-Rbia to Casablanca and a transfer from the Bouregreg River also to Casablanca. There are tentative plans for a large north-south <b>water</b> <b>transfer</b> project with an average conveyance capacity of around 2.74 million cubic meter/day (0.75 billion m3/year) over 500–600km from the Sebou River basin to the water-stressed Tensift basin.|$|E

NHK also reported that radioactive water filling a tunnel near unit 2 has risen 12cm since a leak in a trench was stopped on Wednesday 6 April.|$|E
25|$|Xylem sap {{consumption}} may {{be related}} to osmoregulation. High osmotic pressure in the stomach, caused by high sucrose concentration, can lead to <b>water</b> <b>transfer</b> from the hemolymph to the stomach, thus resulting in hyperosmotic stress and eventually to the death of the insect. Aphids avoid this fate by osmoregulating through several processes. Sucrose concentration is directly reduced by assimilating sucrose toward metabolism and by synthesizing oligosaccharides from several sucrose molecules, thus reducing the solute concentration and consequently the osmotic pressure. Oligasaccharides are then excreted through honeydew, explaining its high sugar concentrations, which can then be used by other animals such as ants. Furthermore, water is transferred from the hindgut, where osmotic pressure has already been reduced, to the stomach to dilute stomach content. Eventually, aphids consume xylem sap to dilute the stomach osmotic pressure. All these processes function synergetically, and enable aphids to feed on high-sucrose-concentration plant sap, as well as to adapt to varying sucrose concentrations.|$|E
25|$|The {{species was}} accidentally {{introduced}} into the North American Great Lakes by way of ballast <b>water</b> <b>transfer</b> in cargo ships. First discovered in North America in the St. Clair River in 1990, the round goby is considered an invasive species with significant ecological and economic impact; the consequences are quite complex as the fish both competes with native species and provides an abundant source of food for them while consuming other invasive species. In other words, the round goby behaves much like most biological invasive controls. An aggressive fish, the round goby outcompetes native species such as the sculpin and logperch for food (such as snails and mussels), shelter and nesting sites, substantially reducing their numbers. Round gobies are also voracious predators of eggs of native fish, many important to the angling industry. The goby's robust ability to survive in degraded environmental conditions has helped to increase its competitive advantage compared to native species. Many native predatory fish such as smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, walleye, salmon and trout have begun to prey on round gobies. The incorporation of the round goby into native foodwebs, coupled with the goby's ability to consume large numbers of invasive mussels (zebra and quagga), may result in greater bioaccumulation of toxins such as PCBs higher in the food chain, since these mussels filter-feed and are known to accumulate persistent contaminants. However, this is partly beneficial because {{even though they do}} not reduce the population of zebra mussels, they do control their population. Hence, it prevents a large scale spread of the zebra mussel, which is also an invasive species in the Great Lakes.|$|E

40|$|The {{customary}} practice of meeting urban water deficit through supply augmentation by tapping new, distant, and multiple-use water sources often disturbs sectoral allocation and causes inter-sectoral water conflicts. The common prescription for resolving such conflicts involves market-based approach to inter-sectoral <b>water</b> <b>transfers.</b> Although the market approach is theoretically sound and also preferable {{as a long-term}} solution, {{the potential for the}} violation of several assumptions implicit in this approach minimizes its practicability as an immediate and universal solution.

40|$|This paper {{begins with}} {{a brief history of}} water law in the west, {{illustrating}} the roots of conflict over water allocation. A more detailed examination of activities in the Columbia Basin follows, describing the many parties affected by issues of water use and the overlapping institutional structures that govern the river and its water. Sources of pressure to change the current pattern of water use are then considered. These include requirements to protect endangered salmon runs and the change over time in the relative values of water for power production and irrigation. This section demonstrates how changes in the value of resources can create conflict when resource allocations are inflexible. Alternative approaches to water allocation are then detailed. An argument is made that water use on the Columbia should be flexible, and that the ability to <b>transfer</b> <b>water</b> more easily from one use to another would be beneficial. The potential economic, social, and environmental benefits and costs of <b>water</b> <b>transfers</b> are also considered.
