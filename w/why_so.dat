5|$|There {{is general}} {{consensus}} that many factors helped trigger the Cambrian explosion, {{but there is}} no generally accepted consensus about the combination and the Cambrian explosion continues to be an area of controversy and research over <b>why</b> <b>so</b> rapid, why at the phylum level, <b>why</b> <b>so</b> many phyla then and none since, and even if the apparent fossil record is accurate.|$|E
5|$|Exmoor {{also has}} a henge located near to Parracombe, {{although}} it has been damaged by ploughing. Alongside this, the moor bears a profusion of other Bronze Age monuments, including between 300 and 400 round barrows, standing stones, and linear stone settings. The creation of these different monument types might explain <b>why</b> <b>so</b> few stone circles were apparently created here.|$|E
5|$|Dodd's career {{returned}} to politically contentious Indigenous issues {{when he played}} a minor role, of Kummengu, in the 1991 film Deadly. This film is a police drama based around {{the death of an}} Indigenous man in police custody. As in Ground Zero, the subject was very topical: the movie was released {{at the same time as}} the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, which had for four years been examining <b>why</b> <b>so</b> many Indigenous Australians died in police detention.|$|E

5|$|Muhammad and {{the other}} prophets of Islam, bored of living in jannah (heaven) and weary of singing the praises of Allah, request {{permission}} to return to Earth. Disappointed by the prophets' request, Allah calls on Muhammad {{to explain why he}} wishes to return, as Allah had already granted him many things. Muhammad replies that he wishes to conduct research, to discover <b>why</b> <b>so</b> few Muslims are coming to heaven. Allah, after removing his glasses, responds that the people had been poisoned by Sukarno's policy of Nasakom and grants Muhammad permission to investigate further.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many members}} of the family Proteaceae, Banksia menziesii is largely self-incompatible; that is, inflorescences require pollinators to be fertilised and produce seed. One {{mechanism}} by which the species promotes cross-pollination with other plants is protandry, whereby the male parts release pollen that becomes non-viable before the female parts become receptive on the same flower spike. The individual flowers are uniform, and it is unclear <b>why</b> <b>so</b> few go on to develop follicles. Published in 1988, a field study conducted in banksia woodland near Perth noted that anthesis occurred on an inflorescence at an average rate of 40 to 60 florets opening per day, although this varied widely between different flowerheads. Foraging by honeyeaters would cause the florets to open, but bees would not.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the amphipods, {{marine and}} {{freshwater}} isopods are entirely benthic. This gives them little chance to disperse to new regions and may explain <b>why</b> <b>so</b> many species are endemic to restricted ranges. Crawling {{is the primary}} means of locomotion, and some species bore into the seabed, the ground or timber structures. Some members of the Flabellifera can swim to a limited extent and have their front three pairs of pleopods modified for this purpose, with their respiratory structures limited to the hind pleopods. Most terrestrial species are slow-moving and conceal themselves under objects or hide in crevices or under bark. The semi-terrestrial sea slaters (Ligia spp.) can run rapidly on land and many terrestrial species can roll themselves into a ball when threatened, a feature that has evolved independently in different groups {{and also in the}} marine sphaeromatids.|$|E

5|$|In his popular books, he {{has argued}} that the human faculty for {{language}} is an instinct, an innate behavior shaped by natural selection and adapted to our communication needs. He is the author of seven books for a general audience. Five of these, The Language Instinct (1994), How the Mind Works (1997), Words and Rules (2000), The Blank Slate (2002), and The Stuff of Thought (2007), describe aspects of the field of psycholinguistics and cognitive science, and include accounts of his own research. In the sixth book, The Better Angels of Our Nature (2011), Pinker makes the case that violence in human societies has, in general, steadily declined with time, and identifies six major causes of this decline. His seventh book, The Sense of Style (2014), is intended as a general style guide that is informed by modern science and psychology, offering advice on how to produce more comprehensible and unambiguous writing in nonfiction contexts and explaining <b>why</b> <b>so</b> much of today's academic and popular writing is difficult for readers to understand.|$|E
5|$|Johnson began {{thinking}} of life after basketball while still {{playing with the}} Lakers. He wondered <b>why</b> <b>so</b> many athletes had failed at business, and sought advice. During his seventh season in the NBA, he {{had a meeting with}} Michael Ovitz, CEO of Creative Artists Agency. Ovitz encouraged him to start reading business magazines and to use every connection available to him. Johnson learned everything he could about business, often meeting with corporate executives during road trips. Johnson's first foray into business, a high-end sporting goods store named Magic 32, failed after only one year, costing him $200,000. The experience taught him to listen to his customers and find out what products they wanted. Johnson has become a leading voice on how to invest in urban communities, creating redevelopment opportunities in underserved areas, most notably through his movie theaters and his partnership with Starbucks. He went to Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz with the idea that he could successfully open the coffee shops in urban areas. After showing Schultz the tremendous buying power of minorities, Johnson was able to purchase 125 Starbucks stores, which reported higher than average per capita sales. The partnership, called Urban Coffee Opportunities, placed Starbucks in locations such as Detroit, Washington, D.C., Harlem, and the Crenshaw District of Los Angeles. Johnson sold his remaining interest in the stores back to the company in 2010, ending a successful twelve-year partnership. Johnson has also invested in urban California real estate and financial service companies catering to America's underserved markets via his Canyon-Johnson and Yucaipa-Johnson funds. Another major project is with Chicago-based Aon Corp., an insurance services company is designed to promote minority businesses. In 2006-07, Johnson was part of a syndicate that bought the Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower, then the tallest building in Brooklyn, for $71 million and converted the 512-foot high landmark structure from an office building into luxury condominiums.|$|E

25|$|Pignut hickory {{is easily}} damaged by fire, which causes stem degrade {{or loss of}} volume, or both. Internal discolorations called mineral streak are common and are one major reason <b>why</b> <b>so</b> few {{standing}} hickories meet trade specifications. Streaks result from yellow-bellied sapsucker pecking, pin knots, worm holes, and mechanical injuries. Hickories strongly resist ice damage and seldom develop epicormic branches.|$|E
25|$|One theory {{goes further}} and {{suggests}} that some special hand-axes were made and displayed by males in search of mate, using a large, well-made hand-axe to demonstrate that they possessed sufficient strength and skill {{to pass on to}} their offspring. Once they had attracted a female at a group gathering, it is suggested that they would discard their axes, perhaps explaining <b>why</b> <b>so</b> many are found together.|$|E

25|$|Sure, {{there have}} been controversies as well. Naya Daur (right) was one instance, thanks to the Madhubala episode.

25|$|The Farm Maps {{also make}} clear <b>why</b> <b>so</b> many {{property}} owners were distraught {{about the coming}} of the grid, and why some of them tried to stop Randel and his crew from completing their work. The maps are replete with houses that are directly in the way of where streets were scheduled to run, and lots that would be bisected, trisected, or completely obliterated by the streets and avenues of the new grid. No wonder people fought back against the Commissioners' Plan, or set their dogs on Randel and his men.|$|E

25|$|Scholars have {{suggested}} that the reason <b>why</b> <b>so</b> many Christian runestones were raised in Uppland is that the district was the focal point in the conflict between Norse paganism and the newly Christianized King of Sweden. It is possible that the chieftains tried to demonstrate their allegiance to the king and to display their Christian faith to the world and to God by adding Christian crosses and prayers on their runestones. What speaks against this theory is the fact that Norway, Denmark, and Götaland did not have any corresponding development in the runestone tradition. Moreover, not a single runestone declares that there was any relationship towards the king. Additionally, the runestones appear to show that the conversion was a rather peaceful process.|$|E
25|$|Musashi {{spent many}} years {{studying}} Buddhism and swordsmanship. He was an accomplished artist, sculptor, and calligrapher. Records also show that he had architectural skills. Also, {{he seems to have}} had a rather straightforward approach to combat, with no additional frills or aesthetic considerations. This was probably due to his real-life combat experience; although in his later life, Musashi followed the more artistic side of bushidō. He made various Zen brush paintings, calligraphy, and sculpted wood and metal. Even in The Book of Five Rings he emphasizes that samurai should understand other professions as well. It should be understood that Musashi's writings were very ambiguous, and translating them into English makes them even more so; that is <b>why</b> <b>so</b> many different translations of The Book of Five Rings can be found. To gain further insight into Musashi's principles and personality, one could read his other works, such as Dokkodo and Hyoho Shiji ni Kajo.|$|E
25|$|The Department of Justice {{decision}} to not prosecute Presser prompted members of Congress {{to investigate the}} handling of the politically sensitive case. Some congressmen were concerned that Presser's close political ties to the Reagan administration had led to favorable treatment, while others wanted to know <b>why</b> <b>so</b> much time and so many resources had been expended when DOJ had no intention of prosecuting Presser. Additionally, many members of Congress had spent years telling voters that the Teamsters were corrupt, and now voters were demanding an answer as to why Presser was not being called to account. DOJ defended its actions by pointing to Presser's long-time role as a criminal informant, but members of Congress were unhappy that DOJ seemed willing tolerate corruption in the nation's largest labor movement. Senators William V. Roth, Jr. (R-Delaware) and Sam Nunn (D-Georgia) ordered the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI) to look into {{the handling of the}} case, and Senator Joe Biden (D-Delaware) asked the Judiciary Committee to probe the matter. The PSI quickly asked the FBI, DOJ and DOL to turn over their files on the Presser probe.|$|E
