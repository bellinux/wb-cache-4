40|$|This {{thesis is}} about {{obligations}} of {{parties to the}} contract of sale and remedies that a party can avail himself of in case of breach by the other party. The study aims at making the subject, as regulated by the Civil Transactions Act, 1984, well understood {{due to the fact}} that the contract of sale has great impact on our economic life, and also explaining how deficient this Act is in relation to the subject. Under the Civil Transactions Act, 1984, the seller is required to perform more duties than the buyer does and these are: transfer of ownership, delivery of the thing sold, <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> and warranty of latent defects. The buyer, on the other hand, has to discharge two duties only, namely payment of the price and taking delivery of the thing sold. Rules governing remedies for breach of contract of sale were elaborately detailed under the previous legislation- the Sales Act, 1974. This is not, however, the case under the Civil Transactions Act, 1984. As is the case in other contractual disputes, damages are mostly claimed in actions for breach of contract of sale. Nevertheless, the Civil Transactions Act, 1984, is completely devoid not only of rules relating to recovery of damages for breach of contract of sale, but also of rules for recovery of damages for breach of contract generally. This constitutes a serious deficiency which requires amendment of the Act...|$|E

50|$|Reliability {{engineering}} relates {{closely to}} safety engineering and to system safety, {{in that they}} use common methods for their analysis and may require input from each other. Reliability engineering focuses on costs of failure caused by system downtime, cost of spares, repair equipment, personnel, and cost <b>of</b> <b>warranty</b> claims. <b>Safety</b> engineering normally focuses more on preserving life and nature than on cost, and therefore deals only with particularly dangerous system-failure modes. High reliability (safety factor) levels also result from good engineering and from attention to detail, and almost never from only reactive failure management (using reliability accounting and statistics).|$|R
5000|$|Implied <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> fitness—Implied <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> fitness {{arises when}} the seller knows the buyer is relying upon the seller's {{expertise}} in choosing goods. Implied <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> merchantability: every {{sale of goods}} fit for ordinary purposes. Express warranties: arise from any statement of fact of promise.|$|R
50|$|In {{common law}} jurisdictions, an implied {{warranty}} is a contract law term for certain assurances that are {{presumed to be}} made in the sale of products or real property, due to the circumstances of the sale. These assurances are characterized as <b>warranties</b> irrespective <b>of</b> whether the seller has expressly promised them orally or in writing. They include an implied <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> fitness for a particular purpose, an implied <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> merchantability for products, implied <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> workmanlike quality for services, and an implied <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> habitability for a home.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, the {{obligation}} is in Article 2, Section 315 of the Uniform Commercial Code. The <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> fitness {{applies to all}} sellers, unlike <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> merchantability which applies only to professional merchants. In the United States, this warranty is sometimes referred to simply as a <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> fitness.|$|R

50|$|Some jurisdictions, however, {{limit the}} ability of sellers or {{manufacturers}} to disclaim the implied <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> merchantability or fitness, such as Massachusetts. (Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 106: Section 2-316A). Furthermore, the <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> habitability is generally not able to be disclaimed.|$|R
5000|$|If the {{merchandise}} is sold with an express [...] "guarantee", the terms <b>of</b> the implied <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> merchantability will fill the gaps left by that guarantee. If {{the terms of}} the express guarantee are not specified, they will be considered to be the terms <b>of</b> the implied <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> merchantability. The UCC allows sellers to disclaim the implied <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> merchantability, provided the disclaimer is made conspicuously and the disclaimer explicitly uses the term [...] "merchantability" [...] in the disclaimer. [...] Some states, however, have implemented the UCC such that this can not be disclaimed.|$|R
25|$|Most {{countries}} have statutes which {{deal directly with}} sale of goods, lease transactions, and trade practices.

The insured, in other words, did not warrant the existence of certain facts, or his knowledge concerning such facts; he gave a warranty only in respect of his opinion.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Epicutaneous {{immunotherapy}} (EPIT) on intact {{skin with}} an epicutaneous delivery system {{has already been}} used in preclinical and clinical studies. In epicutaneous vaccination and immunotherapy, the stripping of skin before application of the allergen is suggested to facilitate the passage of allergen through immune cells. Objectives The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the immunological response induced by EPIT performed on intact and stripped skin in a mouse model of peanut allergy. Methods After oral sensitization with peanut and cholera toxin, BALB/c mice were epicutaneously treated using an epicutaneous delivery system (Viaskin® (DBV Technologies, Paris) applied either on intact skin or on stripped skin. Following EPIT, mice received an exclusive oral peanut regimen, aimed at triggering esophageal and jejunal lesions. We assessed eosinophil infiltration by histology, mRNA expression in the esophagus, antibody levels and peripheral T-cell response. Results EPIT on intact skin significantly reduced Th 2 immunological response (IgE response and splenocyte secretion of Th 2 cytokines) as well as esophageal eosinophilia (2. 7 [*]±[*] 0. 9, compared to Sham 19. 9 [*]±[*] 1. 5, p[*] Conclusions Epicutaneous allergen-specific immunotherapy needs the integrity of superficial layers of the stratum corneum to <b>warranty</b> <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> treatment and to induce a tolerogenic profile of the immune response. </p...|$|R
