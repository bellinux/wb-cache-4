40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{the differences in}} antimicrobial susceptibility and resistance mechanisms against imipenem between Acinetobacter baumannii and Acinetobacter genomic species 13 TU. Methods: A total of 232 non-duplicate Acinetobacter species <b>were</b> <b>consecutively</b> <b>collected</b> from two Korean hospitals in Daegu, Republic of Korea, between November 2004 and November 2005. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by agar dilution methods. Resistance to imipenem was characterized by a carbapenemase activity test and PCR amplification. PFGE was performed to deter-mine the clonal relatedness of imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter species. Results: A. baumannii was the most prevalent species (61. 2 %), followed by Acinetobacter genomic species 13 TU (25. 9 %). The resistance rates of A. baumannii to most antimicrobial agents were {{higher than those of}} other Acinetobacter species, while the resistance rate to imipenem was the highest in Acinetobacter genomic species 13 TU. Imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter genomic species 13 TU iso-lates produced VIM- 2 metallo-b-lactamase, while imipenem-resistant A. baumannii isolates produced OXA- 23 and/or OXA- 51 b-lactamase.

Unlinked anonymous testing of residual blood specimens, which were originally collected for other routine clinical purposes, was performed using rapid immunochromatographic assays. In total, 430 residual blood specimens <b>were</b> <b>consecutively</b> <b>collected</b> over a 6 -week period (April–May 2010). Specimens from the antenatal clinic (ANC) constituted 50. 7 % (218 / 430) of the total whereas specimens from the labour ward accounted for the remaining 49. 3 % (212 / 430). The median age of pregnant women was 29 years (range 16 – 40). The prevalence of HIV- 1 infection was 0. 23 % (1 / 430) [95 % confidence interval= 0. 01 – 1. 29 %]. The only reactive specimen came from a 20 -year-old ANC attendee. We report low HIV prevalence among pregnant women in eastern Sudan but {{further research is needed}} to confirm our findings.

40|$|A rapid {{increase}} in the prevalence of Streptococcus pneumoniae with reduced sensitivity to penicillin (MIC > or = 0. 12 microgram/mL) was noted among clinical isolates during a 15 -month period in 1994 - 1995 {{in the city of}} Malmo, Sweden. All first-time clinical isolates (n = 178) <b>were</b> <b>consecutively</b> <b>collected</b> and investigated for genetic relatedness with BOX-A PCR and arbitrarily primed (AP) PCR. An improved method for chromosomal DNA extraction and the use of three reliable discriminatory primers for AP-PCR of S. pneumoniae are described. Using molecular fingerprinting, 30 different genotypes were discerned among the 178 isolates. The majority (87 %) of isolates belonged to serogroups 6, 9, 15, 19, and 23. Resistance patterns and serogrouping indicated the presence of at least three major phenotypic clones. DNA fingerprinting in conjunction with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values, resistance patterns, and epidemiological data confirmed the existence of two clones belonging to serogroups 6 and 9. Of the 178 isolates, 82 % were from children of preschool age, most of whom attended day-care centers. We conclude that abundant S. pneumoniae strains with MICs > or = 0. 12 microgram/mL for penicillin were present in the city of Malmo during the study period. At least two genetically discrete clones causing clinical illness were identified, and attendance at day-care centers may be {{a major factor in the}} spread of these strains...|$|E

We here evaluated the prognostic role of RT-PCR assays in serially-taken peripheral blood samples from patients with malignant melanoma (MM). Methods One hundred forty-nine melanoma patients with disease stage ranging from I to III <b>were</b> <b>consecutively</b> <b>collected</b> in 1997. A multi-marker RT-PCR assay was used on peripheral blood samples obtained at time of diagnosis and every 6 months during {{the first two years of}} follow-up (total: 5 samples). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed after 83 months of median follow-up. Results Detection of at least one circulating mRNA marker was considered a signal of the presence of CMC (referred to as PCR-positive assay). A significant correlation was found between the rate of recurrences and the increasing number of PCR-positive assays (P = 0. 007). Presence of CMC in a high number (≥ 2) of analysed blood samples was significantly correlated with a poor clinical outcome (disease-free survival: P = 0. 019; overall survival: P = 0. 034). Multivariate analysis revealed that presence of a PCR-positive status does play a role as independent prognostic factors for overall survival in melanoma patients, adding precision to the predictive power of the disease stage. Conclusion Our findings indicated that serial RT-PCR assay may identify a high risk subset of melanoma patients with occult cancer cells constantly detected in blood circulation. Prolonged presence of CMCs seems to act as a surrogate marker of disease progression or a sign of more aggressive disease. </p...|$|E

We set out to determine the levels of Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistance to first- and second-line TB drugs in an urban population in Zambia. Sputum samples <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> <b>consecutively</b> from all smear-positive, new and previously treated patients, from four diagnostic centres in Ndola between January and July 2006. Drug susceptibility testing was performed using the proportion method against four first- and two second-line TB drugs. Results. Among 156 new cases, any resistance was observed to be 7. 7 %, monoresistance to isoniazid and rifampicin was 4. 5 % and 1. 3 %, respectively. Of 31 retreatment cases, any resistance was observed to be 16. 1 %, monoresistance to isoniazid and rifampicin was 3. 3 % for each drug, and one case of resistance to both isoniazid and rifampicin (multidrug resistance) was detected.

40|$|Background: {{the risk}} of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is {{increasing}} in patients with type- 2 diabetes. Prevalence and factors related to the increased risk of NAFLD in diabetic patients in Indonesia has never been studied before. Data regarding the profile of fibrosis in the population has also been unknown. This study aimed to identify the difference on the profile of diabetic patients with and without NAFLD {{as well as the}} degree of fibrosis. Methods: the study was conducted using a cross-sectional method in type- 2 diabetic patients who were treated at the outpatient clinic of endocrinology and metabolic division in Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital. Sampling <b>was</b> done <b>consecutively.</b> <b>Collected</b> data comprised of age, duration of diabetes, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, HDL, triglyceride, and HbA 1 C levels. Abdominal ultrasonography was conducted for all patients to determine the presence of NAFLD. Patients with NAFLD were subsequently underwent transient elastography in order to assess their degree of liver fibrosis. Chi-square or Fisher’s-Exact tests were used for bivariate analysis and logistic regression was used for multivariate analysis. Results: as many as 186 patients were analyzed in the study and 84 patients (45. 2 %) were demonstrated to have NAFLD. Transient elastography examinations were carried out in 68 patients and 17 patients (25. 0 %) were found with severe fibrosis. Univariate analysis showed significant differences on BMI (PR= 1. 878; 95 %CI= 1. 296 - 2. 721; p< 0. 001) and waist circumference (PR= 2. 368; 95 %CI= 1. 117 - 5. 017; p= 0. 018) between patients with and without NAFLD. However, the multivariate test showed that BMI was the only factor that had a significance difference between both groups (OR= 2. 989; 95 %CI= 1. 625 - 5. 499; p< 0. 001). Conclusion: prevalence of NAFLD among type- 2 diabetic patients in Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital has reached 45. 2 % and 25. 0 % among them had severe fibrosis.

40|$|Objective: To {{screen for}} amyloid {{and to assess}} {{associated}} clinical and laboratory characteristics in Egyptian patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods: Abdominal subcutaneous fat aspirates <b>were</b> <b>consecutively</b> <b>collected</b> from 112 patients (103 women, nine men) having RA for five years or more. To detect amyloid, fat smears were stained with Congo red and the concentration of amyloid A protein in fat tissue was measured. Clinical, radiological, and laboratory characteristics of the patients were assessed. Results: Amyloid was detected in eight (7 %) of the fat smears stained with Congo red. Compared with the Congo red stain, the sensitivity for detecting amyloid by measurement of amyloid A protein in fat tissue was 75 % and the specificity was 100 %. The amount of amyloid found was small for both methods. The median disease duration of the eight amyloid patients was significantly longer (17 years) {{than that of the}} non-amyloid patients (10 years). Bronchopulmonary disease and constipation were more common, whereas proteinuria and chronic renal insufficiency were not. The number of swollen joints and the number of red blood cells were significantly lower in the amyloid group. Conclusions: Quantification of amyloid A protein and staining with Congo red are strongly concordant methods of screening for amyloid in fat tissue. The prevalence of amyloid in Egyptian patients with RA is 7 %. Proteinuria is not a discriminating feature, whereas long disease duration, constipation, bronchopulmonary symptoms, and a moderate to Iow number of red blood cells may help to identify the arthritic patients with amyloid...|$|E
40|$|Background: Escherichia coli (E. coli) is {{the most}} {{commonly}} isolated bacteria in human pathology. In Morocco the data concerning the nature and the rates of antibiotic resistance of E. coli in both hospitals and city environment remains relatively poor and needs further investigations. Methods: During a 16 months period, E. coli isolates were collected from different culture specimens received in the Bacteriology Department of the Military teaching Hospital Mohammed-V-Rabat for routine diagnostic purposes. E. coli isolates were identified and their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern was determined. Results: A total of 1369 E. coli isolates comprising 33 % (1369 / 4110) of culture-positive samples <b>were</b> <b>consecutively</b> <b>collected.</b> Isolates of E. coli were, in 40. 5 % (554 / 1369) of cases from hospitalized patients and in 59. 5 % (815 / 1369) of cases from outpatients. Urine isolates represented 82 % (1123 / 1369) of the cases. High rates of resistance were found for amoxicillin (42. 5 %), cefalotin (30. 4 %), norfoloxacin (29. 9 %) and sulfamethoxazole (37. 7 %). The detection rate of ESBL was 6. 1 % (85 / 1369). In hospitalized patients 11. 9 % of the isolates of E. coli (66 / 554) had an ESBL phenotype while in outpatients cases only 2. 3 % of isolates of E. coli (19 / 815) had this phenotype. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that more judicious use of antibiotics is needed especially in probabilistic treat-ment. The emergence of ESBL in the Moroccan cities is {{an indicator of the}} severity of this problem that is not limited to health care facilities...|$|E

40|$|Background: There is an {{emerging}} global increase of metabolic syndrome prevalence due to increasing of obesity. Obesity and metabolic syndrome beginning in childhood progressing into adulthood.  Dietary saturated fat and fiber intake {{play a role}} in etiology in obesity. Objective: This {{study was to examine the}} associations between dietary saturated fat intake, fiber intake and components of metabolic syndrome among obese adolescents. Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted to 57 obese students aged 13 - 15 years old of SMP Nasima and SMP Kesatrian 2 Semarang, based on body mass index for ages. Subjects of this study <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> <b>consecutively.</b> Data <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> through waist circumference and blood pressure measurements, fasting biochemical serum analysis and dietary intake assessment.  Rank Spearman and Pearson correlation test was used to examine the associations between of dietary saturated fat and fiber intake to components of metabolic syndrome. Results: There were 46 subjects (80, 7 %) had metabolic syndrome and 11 subjects (19, 3 %) had the pre-metabolic syndrome. There was no association between dietary saturated fat intake and waist circumference, HDL cholesterol, triglyceride, fasting blood glucose levels and blood pressure. Fiber intake was negatively associated with blood triglyceride levels (r = - 0. 340; p = 0. 01). Conclusion: There was no association between dietary saturated fat intake and components of metabolic syndrome. There was an association between dietary fiber intake with blood triglyceride levels.

40|$|Objective: Serological {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that one of the risk factors for aneurysm development is C. pneumoniae infection. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate whether there is an association between the presence of C. pneumoniae DNA in aneurysms and ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms. Methods: Aortic walls <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> <b>consecutively</b> from 30 patients with intact AAA, 16 patients with ruptured AAA and 19 healthy organ donors (control). Purified DNAs from all aortas were analyzed for the presence of C. pneumoniae DNA in parallel by polymerase chain reaction-enzyme immunoassay (PCR-EIA) and agarose gel electrophoresis. PCR-EIA has a high sensitivity in detecting low DNA copy number in clinical atherosclerotic samples. Results: C. pneumoniae DNA was detected more frequently in patients with aneurysms, particular with ruptured aneurysms. The incidence of positive C. pneumoniae DNA was 73. 3 % in intact AAA and 10. 5 % in control aortas, with the highest frequency in ruptured AAA (100 %) (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: Giving the high specificity and sensitivity of PCR-EIA, these findings support the association of C. pneumoniae in the pathogenesis of aneurysm development, growth and rupture. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
