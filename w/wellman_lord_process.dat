The lords convened at Holyroodhouse then rode to the Tollbooth near St Giles. Mary, Queen of Scots was represented by the crown, mace and sword. After a speech by William Maitland, the articles of the peace with France were read and confirmed. The Lords of the Articles were chosen - these decided the agenda for the full parliament session. Then all the <b>lords</b> <b>processed</b> with the Duke to the Netherbow, and back to the Palace. The whole town wore armour, with trumpets sounding, and all other kinds of music.

50|$|From 1155 Henry {{claimed that}} Pope Adrian IV {{had given him}} {{authorisation}} to reform the Irish church by assuming control of Ireland, but Anne Duggan, professor emeritus of history at King's College, London considers the Laudabiliter to be a falsification of an existing letter {{and that was not}} in fact Adrian's intention. Religious practices and ecclesiastical organisation in Ireland had evolved divergently from those in areas of Europe influenced more directly by the Holy See, although many of these differences had been eliminated or greatly lessened by the time the bull was issued in 1155. Further, the former Irish church had never sent its dues ("tithes") to Rome. Henry's primary motivation for invading Ireland 1171 was to control Strongbow and other Norman <b>lords.</b> In the <b>process</b> he accepted the fealty of the Gaelic kings at Dublin in November 1171, and he summoned the Synod of Cashel in 1172, which brought the Irish Church into conformity with English and European norms.|$|R

Ahankari considered cloning himself {{after suffering a}} near fatal encounter with William Boother, an infiltrator. He selected Dr. Heathrow to create a clone of himself in every aspect. The clone grew to adulthood very rapidly due to accelerated cloned genes. A host of super villains was selected to impart training and equipment to the clone {{in order to make}} him a perfect successor to the terrorist leader. At this point, Ahankaris father, fearing that the clone would also turn out evil like his son, arranged for the Indian mystic [...] "Rudraksh Baba" [...] to take charge of his grandson. After some initial resistance by the clone, Rudraksh Baba mystically purged all evil from the clone and concentrated it under the mark of a Trident, carried by <b>Lord</b> Shiva. This <b>process</b> gave rise to another side effect - whenever the clone sensed evil, his skin would turn blue. Rudraksh baba instructed the clone, now known as Aman (Peace) to live the life of a hero, donning the ceremonial Indian [...] "dhoti" [...] as a mark of his embraced mysticism. Aman took up the name Super Indian and went on to learn heroics from various Indian Superheroes from the Raj Comics universe. He defends India & the high tech Metro City, his base of operations. he now protects the Metro City. He calls all the members of P.O.E.M (Protectors Of Earth & Mankind) his uncles and aunt as he has no real relative in this world, and looks up to them as his guardians.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the conversion}} processes of 17 urban Muslims in Kenya {{who decided to}} follow Jesus Christ. It first describes conversion from a multidisciplinary perspective by introducing sociological, psychological, anthropological, theological and missiological understandings of such a change in religious affiliation. Next in-depth interviews are analysed using principles of grounded theory, where new theory is developed by interaction between data from reality, the analysis and existing theories (abductive reasoning). The main findings are that the conversion of Muslims who accept Jesus Christ as Saviour and <b>Lord</b> is a <b>process</b> that develops {{over a period of}} time through phases with a cognitive and an affective dimension. Changes with regard to convictions and attitudes take place simultaneously on several properties or ‘layers’ of both dimensions. The process is influenced by significant factors in the form of causal and intervening conditions, resulting in consequences for the convert in the form of a transformation as well as in changed relationships with the community. Gender, socio-economic level, education as well as the community from which the converts come influence the process. In order to describe the complex dynamics that are at work in such conversion processes of Muslims, a Matrix of Conversion Processes is developed in which the multiple movements of a convert on the two dimensions are put in relation to six chronological phases. A matrix of different types of conversion processes and the description of four typical processes emerge from the analysis. In order to facilitate conversion processes, cognitive and affective elements need to be addressed together. The interaction between different factors, the will-power of the person and the influence of God determine the development, an understanding that is relevant for conversion studies, as well as for missiology and the missionary task of the church in Kenya and beyond.

40|$|The {{roots of}} the {{contemporary}} study of oral tradition lie in the German Romantic movement, for example {{in the work of}} great collectors of oral folklore such as the Grimms. But collecting folklore is one thing; understanding exactly what an oral tradition is and how oral traditions are transmitted is another. The most signifi cant contribution to such an understanding has been made by Milman Parry and Albert Lord. Their seminal theory of oral-formulaic performance has given rise to a great deal of scholarly activity. 1 One curiosity is how little of this research has taken place within linguistics. There are good reasons why more of it should have been conducted there. First, it is research into the nature of performance. If we take linguistic performance in general to consist of the uses to which native speakers put the linguistic resources that they have at their disposal, then oral-formulaic theory should be of interest to linguists. Second, Parry and Lord make claims about the way in which memory is engaged during performance, claims that should also interest linguists who are concerned with performance. Third, linguistics concerns itself with native speakers’ linguistic resources. One of the primary resources of oral-formulaic performance is an inventory of oral formulae. Formulae are clearly lexicalized linguistic fragments very like the idioms of normal speech. It follows from considerations such as these that {{it should be possible to}} undertake quite exacting linguistic research into oral-formulaic traditions, and thus lend a high degree of linguistic precision to the approach of Parry and <b>Lord,</b> in the <b>process</b> making this approach more empirically vulnerable. 2 It is particularly interesting to attempt to do so in the case of oral transmission, since greate...|$|R
5000|$|Jack Slate is {{a police}} officer partnered with his K-9 unit, Shadow. The two patrol Grant City, a {{metropolis}} seemingly populated with more criminals than honest citizens. One night while on a routine patrol, Jack responds to a call at a construction zone, only to find his own father murdered. In pursuit of his father's killer, Jack is led through a labyrinth of crime and corruption. He is eventually framed for another murder by the corrupt police chief Richard [...] "Dick" [...] Hennesey, {{in a bid to}} stop Jack before he undermines the status quo. However, after seven months in prison, Jack escapes from imprisonment by putting battery acid on the electric chair wires and hunts down Hennesey, clearing away the city's crime <b>lords</b> in the <b>process.</b> He first gets clothes at the apartment he was framed at and goes to Chinatown for information. There he battles Fat Chow and his goons and interrogates Marvin Silt, a goon who tried to run him down outside the prison before a woman named Eve Adams murders Silt. Eve is able to identify the assassin who was hired to frame Jack and the two have to battle Fat Chow and his goons again, with Jack killing Fat Chow before they are able to escape. Afterward Jack visits his father's grave and meets Hildy, his father's former assistant there and he learns from her that his father was investigating the corrupt mayor and police force for mayoral candidate Gloria Exner before his murder. Jack comes under attack by unknown attackers in clown masks, but eventually escapes the cemetery and links up with Eve again to foil an assassination attempt on Exner at a public debate. The two foil the attempt, but Eve is murdered by Patch, the assassin who framed Jack. Jack chases down Patch and causes his limo to crash, but the crash kills Patch, preventing interrogation, although Jack takes his pager.|$|R
5000|$|The Devon topographer Rev. John Swete {{passed by}} Shute on his {{excursion}} of 29 January 1795, and recorded the following in his [...] "Journal", having just left Colyton: [...] "I had now, by ascending somewhat of the hill, got {{in sight of}} the Old House of Shute, {{a good deal of}} which has been taken(-down). From the road it is seen as in the sketch (see at right), an embattled edifice of a castellated figure with projecting towers both in front and behind. A tower with pinnacles rear'd itself close {{at the back of the}} castle appearing as if it belonged to a church or chapel;" [...] (i.e. St Michael's Church) [...] "a fine relief was given to the whole of this pile by means of some noble trees that rose high behind it and over all was beheld (an) elevated hill." [...] He continues to relate the story of the armed encounter of Bonville and Courtenay at Clyst Heath in 1455, which he understood to have been a battle of single combat, adding Risdon's story of the gallantry displayed toward his opponent by Courtenay when Bonville accidentally dropped his sword whereupon the former stood still and cast away his sword also, and to end the contest the two [...] "lovingly embraced one another". Modern historians relate the incident without any such niceities, and indeed so bitter remained Courtenay's hatred of Bonville that he it was who successfully urged the unwilling King Henry VI to execute him after the Second Battle of St Albans in 1461. After having set-out the descent of Shute to the Poles, Swete noted that Old Shute was becoming neglected: [...] "Thus the two rival families of Colcombe and Shute being no more, the two seats acknowledg'd one gentleman as their <b>lord.</b> But in <b>process</b> of time instead of the families, the seats themselves became rivals to one another and, Shute getting the superiority by the translation of the Pole family thither, Colcombe Castle became deserted and mouldered into a ruin and now in its turn, by another removal of the family to the new house, Shute is experiencing the same fate". He finishes his account of his visit to Shute by regretting due to lack of time his not having made a sketch of Shute Gateway [...] "Which is by far too remarkable and picturesque to be omitted", and hopes to return again for the purpose.|$|R
40|$|National Research Council Canada (NRC) is {{collaborating with}} College of the North Atlantic (CNA) {{to develop an}} ocean wave-driven pump to supply the CNA shore-based {{aquaculture}} centre in Lord's Cove, Newfoundland. NRC provides a combination of physical model testing under controlled laboratory conditions and computer simulation using numerical modelling tools developed at NRC and commercial software. The CNA plans to demonstrate the sustainability of a shore-based aquaculture centre {{in the context of}} rural Newfoundland. The efficiency of the centre depends in part on its energy consumption, a major part of which is supplying seawater to a facility some distance from the ocean and above sea level. The development of a seawater supply pump driven by the power of ocean waves would reduce the electrical costs for the centre. The NRC is supporting a staged design program through numerical and physical model testing to select a robust design optimized for the local sea conditions at the Lord's Cove mooring site. The wave pump is inspired by designs for wave energy converters. But since wave energy converters have not converged on a single design, there are major risks and costs in designing a wave pump, from construction and testing of physical models for competing designs to mooring failure and potential loss of the device in the hurricane-force storms typical of southern Newfoundland. Using lessons learned in the energy sector, risks can be mitigated by systematically testing the behaviour and response of proposed concepts through a staged design program, starting from characterizing the hydrodynamic characteristics of a simplified model through progressively larger, more complex physical and numerical models used in functional tests. This approach systematically directs the design process toward a single prototype optimized for performance in specified wave conditions using scaled model tests in advance of the most costly stage of sea trials. The goals of the staged design program for the CNA wave-driven pump are to 2 ̆ 022 evaluate various design concepts 2 ̆ 022 select a design suited to the CNA mooring site 2 ̆ 022 optimize the design for a typical sea state and 2 ̆ 022 specify a mooring robust enough to keep the platform on station during the sometimes extreme sea states at Lord's Cove. The program began with characterization of the chosen mooring site outside <b>Lord's</b> Cove. <b>Processed</b> wave buoy data from this site informed the estimation of mooring line loads using numerical tools developed by NRC and typical sea states on which to focus design optimization. In the second stage, a numerical tool was developed to estimate pump output and validated against test results for a physical pump. In the third stage, various wave pump platform design concepts were evaluated based on estimation of hydrodynamic characteristics. The designs were characterized using a combination of physical model tests in the NRC 200 -metre wave tank in St. John's and computer simulations using Ansys Aqwa and Matlab. A sample pump platform design is shown as a scale model and a numerical mesh in Fig. 1. In the fourth stage, which will precede a full-scale prototype deployment at sea, a design has been selected and an operational scale model wave pump platform has been tested in the NRC wave facilities. Numerical modelling is used to choose a mooring for the full-scale deployment. In this staged design program, the use of physical model tests and computer simulation are complementary methods used alternatively to solve potentially costly and time-consuming problems. A selection of the problems encountered {{in the design of the}} wave pump platform is presented along with a critique of the solutions applied by NRC to build confidence in a wave-driven pump design tailored for the CNA site.

40|$|Exploring the {{leadership}} of New Zealand’s diverse cultural groups is of great importance in providing effective leadership. New Zealand’s population is diverse and rapidly changing (Statistics New Zealand, 2004 b), resulting in leader-follower relationships increasingly being enacted in the cross-cultural context. As research suggests, cultural variations of leadership exist (Brodbeck et al., 2000; House, Hanges, Javidan, Dorfman, & Gupta, 2004), and inappropriate leadership could stifle {{the leadership}} <b>process</b> (<b>Lord</b> & Maher, 1993), it may be especially important to recognise cultural difference in leadership. Well-respected leadership theorists suggest that leadership behaviour is both culturally similar and different (Brodbeck et al., 2000; House et al., 2004), with distinct prototypes of leadership existing in each culture. Followers will only be influenced by leaders’ behaviour which they recognise from that prototype (Lord & Maher, 1993). To be effective, leaders’ behaviour must match followers’ culturally contingent leadership expectation (Popper & Druyan, 2001). New Zealand research supports this theory, confirming the existence of culturally unique leadership behaviour domestically (Ah Chong & Thomas, 1997; Love, 1991 a). If the leadership expectations of New Zealand’s diverse cultural groups are not recognised, {{the result will be}} ineffective leadership for significant groups. This study investigates perceptions of outstanding Maori and Pakeha leaders by culturally similar followers. In doing so, it examines the unique Maori and Pakeha leadership prototypes, exploring their similarities and differences. In addition, it considers ways in which this course of research could impact on effective leadership in New Zealand. A multi-method approach was taken by this study in exploring perceived Maori and Pakeha leadership. The GLOBE (Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness) survey was employed as this study’s quantitative component. The GLOBE is currently cross-cultural leadership’s fore-running research programme, investigating culture’s impact on leadership processes in 62 cultures, with the aim of developing a truly cross-cultural leadership theory. Close iwi consultation with Te Atiawa and Maori academics was employed as this study’s qualitative component. This study’s findings suggest similarities and differences in how Maori and Pakeha followers perceived the outstanding leadership behaviour of culturally similar leaders. Broadly, they suggest that outstanding Maori leaders were perceived as exhibiting a greater degree of humane-orientated and self-protective behaviour. In some instances, outstanding Maori leaders were also perceived as exhibiting a greater degree of charismatic/value-based and team-orientated behaviour, although in some cases this was perceived as similar for outstanding Maori and Pakeha leaders. Participative and autonomous leadership behaviour was perceived as making a similar contribution to outstanding Maori and Pakeha leadership. This study’s findings support previous research which suggests culturally unique leadership prototypes. It offers insight into Maori leadership (as perceived by Maori followers) and provides a rough sketch-map of homogeneous and heterogeneous aspects of Maori and Pakeha leaders’ perceived behaviour...|$|R
