5|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{reported}} an age-related decline in dopamine synthesis and dopamine receptor density (i.e., the number of receptors) in the brain. This decline has been shown to occur in the striatum and extrastriatal regions.C]DOPA |journal=Life Sciences |volume=79 |issue=8 |pages=730–736 |doi=10.1016/j.lfs.2006.02.017 |pmid=16580023 }} Decreases in the D1, D2, and D3 receptors are well documented. The reduction of dopamine <b>with</b> <b>aging</b> is thought to be responsible for many neurological symptoms that increase in frequency with age, such as decreased arm swing and increased rigidity. Changes in dopamine levels may also cause age-related changes in cognitive flexibility.|$|E

40|$|AbstractStatic {{and dynamic}} {{aspects of the}} near pupil {{response}} were studied in human subjects in the age range when accommodative amplitude steadily declines. Dynamic accommodative and pupillary responses to step stimuli were recorded in 66 subjects (ages: 14 – 45 years). Exponential fits to data provided amplitude, peak velocity and time constants. Accommodative amplitude decreased linearly <b>with</b> <b>age</b> (p< 0. 05). Pupil constriction per diopter of accommodative response increased exponentially <b>with</b> <b>age</b> (p< 0. 05). The amplitude of pupil constriction for a 2 D stimulus decreased linearly <b>with</b> <b>age</b> (p< 0. 05) and for a 5 D stimulus did not change <b>with</b> <b>age</b> (p= 0. 90). The latency of pupil constriction did not change <b>with</b> <b>age</b> (p= 0. 65), while the mean peak velocity decreased linearly <b>with</b> <b>age</b> (p< 0. 05).

5|$|Similar {{mechanisms}} {{exist to}} promote the degradation of oxidatively damaged proteins via the proteasome system. In particular, proteasomes localized to the nucleus are regulated by PARP and actively degrade inappropriately oxidized histones. Oxidized proteins, which often form large amorphous aggregates in the cell, can be degraded directly by the 20S core particle without the 19S regulatory cap and do not require ATP hydrolysis or tagging with ubiquitin. However, high levels of oxidative damage increases the degree of cross-linking between protein fragments, rendering the aggregates resistant to proteolysis. Larger numbers and sizes of such highly oxidized aggregates are associated <b>with</b> <b>aging.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to investigate the development of a rapidly repeating movement of the whole body from ground reaction forces exerted during a side jump. Subjects were 246 healthy females aged 5 - 17 years, and their physique(body height, body mass, skinfold thickness), muscular power(vertical jump, standing broad jump) and rapidly repeating movement(side jump) were measured. The procedure of the side jump were hopping between two parallel lines on the force plate from right to left alternately as quickly as possible. The distance between the lines was fixed at one third of the mean body height at each age. Force curves gained by using force plate were calculated using the jumping frequency per 1 second(the frequency calculated from the time required for one jump), the times on the ground and in the air, the maximum vertical and horizontal forces, the vertical and horizontal impulses and the kicking angle calculated from maximum vertical and horizontal forces. The ferquency of the side jump per 1 second increased significantly <b>with</b> <b>age</b> by 9 years and decreased gradually <b>with</b> <b>age</b> by 17 years. The time on the ground and the time in the air shortened significantly <b>with</b> <b>age</b> by 9 years and prolonged gradually <b>with</b> <b>age</b> by 17 years. The maximum vertical force per unit body mass didn't change remarkably <b>with</b> <b>age,</b> but the maximum horizontal force per unit body mass increased significantly <b>with</b> <b>age</b> by 13 years and decreased gradually <b>with</b> <b>age</b> by 17 years. The kicking angle decreased significantly <b>with</b> <b>age</b> by 13 years and increased gradually <b>with</b> <b>age</b> by 17 years. The vertical impulse per unit body mass decreased significantly <b>with</b> <b>age</b> by 9 years, but the horizontal impulse per unit body mass didn't change remarkably <b>with</b> <b>age.</b> These results suggest that a rapid repeating ability of the whole body develops by increasing the horizontal force in comparison with vertical force and by decreasing the kicking angle and the vertical displacement of the center of gravity <b>with</b> <b>age</b> by 9 years and drops gradually by ncrease of fat mas <b>with</b> <b>age</b> by 17 years...|$|R
