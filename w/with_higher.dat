We will try to expand on these classes as much as possible. We first discuss properties of classes of semigroups in which every semigroup either has high symmetry or is embeddable into a semigroup <b>with</b> <b>high</b> symmetry. We show that normal bands are embeddable into normal bands <b>with</b> <b>high</b> symmetry and also that the bands, free {{in the class of}} all bands that can be embedded in some band <b>with</b> <b>high</b> symmetry, are precisely the free bands. In accordance with techniques in [38], we show an embedding of a normal band into a normal band <b>with</b> <b>high</b> symmetry that preserves much of the original structure. This allows us to look at an embedding of orthodox semigroups for which the band of idempotents is embeddable into a band <b>with</b> <b>high</b> symmetry.

From this, it will then follow that every orthodox semigroup is embeddable into a bisimple orthodox semigroup...|$|R
