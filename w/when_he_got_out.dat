25|$|Bud Moore Engineering took {{a three-year}} hiatus until 1972, when David Pearson piloted the No. 15 Ford to a 26th-place finish at Riverside. LeeRoy Yarbrough, Dick Brooks, and Donnie Allison also drove that year. In 1973, Bobby Isaac climbed {{on board with}} Sta-Power Industries sponsoring. Isaac had six top-ten {{finishes}} until the Talladega 500, when he radioed in to Moore {{and told him he}} was quitting. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of the car, Isaac announced he was retiring. Some reports surfaced saying Isaac quit because voices in his head had told him to. His replacement was an unpolished rookie named Darrell Waltrip, who had a top-ten at Darlington Raceway.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 9 June 1972, Catholic {{civilian}} Jean Smith (or Smyth) was shot dead on the Glen Road. Jean was a 24-year-old mother of one. She was shot while sitting {{in the passenger seat}} of a car at the Glen Road bus terminus. As her male companion turned the car, he heard {{what he thought was a}} tyre bursting. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> to check, the car was hit by a burst of automatic gunfire. Smith was shot in the head and died shortly afterward. Her companion stopped a passing taxi and asked the driver to take her to hospital. However, the taxi was then stopped by police and diverted to Andersonstown RUC base, where they were held for several hours.|$|E

Foxx contributed to his character's appearance, suggesting full-scalp tattoos and a retro clothing style. Foxx described the appearance as [...] "a guy who maybe went to jail for a minute and now he's living in his own time capsule. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> he went right back to the clothes he thought were hot when he went in." ...|$|E
500|$|Buzzcocks manager Richard Boon and {{frontman}} Pete Shelley {{have both}} been credited with suggesting the band name [...] "Stiff Kittens", but settled on [...] "Warsaw" [...] shortly before their first gig, referencing David Bowie's song [...] "Warszawa". Warsaw debuted on 29 May 1977 at the Electric Circus, supporting the Buzzcocks, Penetration and John Cooper Clarke. They received immediate national exposure due to reviews of the gig in the NME by Paul Morley and in Sounds by Ian Wood. Tony Tabac played drums that night after joining the band two days earlier. Mason was soon made the band's manager and Tabac was replaced on drums in June 1977 by Steve Brotherdale, who also played in the punk band Panik. During his tenure with Warsaw, Brotherdale tried to get Curtis to leave the band and join Panik and even got Curtis to audition for the band. In July 1977, Warsaw recorded a set of five demo tracks at Pennine Sound Studios, Oldham. Uneasy with Brotherdale's aggressive personality, the band fired him soon after the demo sessions. Driving home from the studio, they pulled over and asked Brotherdale to check on a flat tyre; <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of the car, they sped off.|$|E

The plan was to have Armond Morales take the slot <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of the Army, but the group went bust prior to this time and disbanded. Fowler decided to take the Oak Ridge Quartet name back and called the [...] "Country Boys" [...] the Oak Ridge Quartet. Page then took the baritone position.|$|E
2500|$|The Australian team toured India in February 2001 for 3 {{tests and}} 5 ODIs. The tour {{was billed as}} the [...] "Final Frontier" [...] for Steve Waugh's all conquering men who came to India {{on the back of}} 15 {{consecutive}} Test wins. The Australian team extended their run to 16 consecutive wins as they beat India convincingly in the first test by 10 wickets. Dravid scored 9 in the first innings as India folded for 176 runs. In the second innings Dravid, along with Tendulkar, tried to show some resistance. At one point Dravid mistimed a pull that Slater claimed to have caught cleanly. However, the third umpire thought otherwise. Dravid stood ground. Slater, in a [...] "moment of madness" [...] as described by Peter Roebuck, had an altercation with Dravid and on-field umpires. Dravid's 196 ball long resistance finally ended <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> bowled to Warne for 39 runs.|$|E

Cassidy and Ben {{met in the}} maternity ward of St. Vincent's in [...] "Coming to Grips" [...] when Ben was pursuing prolific soul Jack King. After a string of dates in the hospital cafeteria, Cassidy began to ask questions, specifically about Ben's wedding ring; {{it was at that}} point that Ben came clean about his green card marriage to Sara. The three of them came to an understanding, although Cassidy would still get a little excited about being Ben's [...] "mistress". When Immigration busted Ben and Sara, Cassidy was the one who took Ben to jail, excited at the prospect that he would be single again <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>out.</b> In [...] "The Sweet Science", Ben explains to Nina that Cassidy ditched him while he was still in jail.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the failure}} of the Munich Beer-hall putsch, Hitler was convicted of high treason and imprisoned. When the 1924 Bayreuth Festival opened, Chamberlain's efforts to {{identify}} the festival with völkisch politics finally bore fruit. The Festspielhügel and the way leading up to it was decorated with völkisch symbols like the swastika, parades by the nationalist Verbände were held outside the Festspielhügel, prominent völkisch leaders like General Erich Ludendorff appeared on the stage to give a speech attacking the Weimar Republic before one of the operas was performed, and a petition was offered to the audiences demanding that Hitler be pardoned. The 1924 festival led to 10,000 people in one night signing the petition asking for Hitler's release. From his prison cell at Landsberg prison, Hitler wrote to Siegfried Wagner expressing his sorrow about being unable to attend his beloved Bayreuth Festival and to express his thanks for the entire Wagner family and Chamberlain for turning the Bayreuth festival into a völkisch rally, [...] adding that <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of prison, he would come to Bayreuth as [...] "the first witness and herald" [...] of Germany's rebirth. Hitler stated this would be the best medicine for Chamberlain's health as [...] "the road to Berlin" [...] started in Bayreuth. In May 1926, one year before his death, Chamberlain was visited by Hitler and Goebbels in Bayreuth. Chamberlain assured Hitler of his belief that he was the [...] "chosen one" [...] destined to lead Germany back to greatness after the defeat of 1918, make the Reich a world power and finally smash the Jews. Much of Hitler's genuine affection for Chamberlain was {{due to the fact that}} Chamberlain never lost his faith in Hitler's potential, even at time in the mid-1920s when the NSDAP was faring very poorly.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{there are}} downsides to {{having such a}} cricket-loving population. Many Indians hold cricket very close to their hearts and losses are not {{received}} well by the Indian population. In some cases, particularly after losses to Pakistan or after {{a long string of}} weak performances, there have been reports of player effigies being burnt in the streets and vandalism of player homes. In many cases, players have come under intense attention from the media for negative reasons, this has been considered as {{one of the reasons for}} Sourav Ganguly being left out of the Indian team. At times, when a match is surrounded by controversy, it has resulted in a debacle. For example, when India slid to defeat against Australia at Brabourne Stadium in 1969, fans began throwing stones and bottles onto the field as well as setting fire to the stands, before laying siege to the Australian dressing rooms. During the same tour, a stampede occurred at Eden Gardens when tickets were oversold and India fell to another loss; the Australian team bus was later stoned with bricks. A similar event occurred during the 1996 Cricket World Cup, where India were losing the semi-final to Sri Lanka at Eden Gardens. In this case, the fan behaviour was directed at the Indian team in disappointment at their lacklustre performance. An armed guard had to be placed at the home of captain Mohammad Azharuddin to ensure his safety. Indian fans have also been passionate in their following of Sachin Tendulkar, who has been commonly thought of as one of the best batsmen in the world. Glorified for the bulk of his career, a riot occurred in early 1999 in a Test against Pakistan at Eden Gardens after a collision with Pakistani paceman Shoaib Akhtar saw him run out, forcing police to eject spectators and the game to be played in an empty stadium. Although in 2006, a string of low scores resulted in Tendulkar being booed by the Mumbai crowd <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> against England ...|$|E
