5|$|We {{always start}} out with a musical idea. Great effort goes into {{creating}} a solid melodic core. We both play the keyboards and program, but in general Mikkel plays the instruments and controls Pro Tools, while Tor has the executive overlook as well as lyrical input. However, we both are hands on and have no rules or limitations. When we have some killer beats and musical starting points, we hook up with one of our favorite topline writers, who gets cracking on the lyrics and melody. <b>We</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> there's a lot of melody in the track, so it can inspire the writer. Together with the topline writer we work, often tweek and simplify the song, and never quit before we feel we've got a killer hook.|$|E

First of all, we can make sure that the parents of these {{children}} keep them in school until their preferred level (college, university, etc.). They also need to teach/lead the mindsets of the children about how education is important and how child labor should not be their only main focus, but education should be too. More people should do this, while still focusing on their finances.|$|E

25|$|Let our graph {{have two}} {{partitions}} U, V. The key {{idea is to}} add two dummy vertices {{on each side of}} the graph: uDummy connecting it to all unmatched vertices in U and vDummy connecting to all unmatched vertices in V. Now if we run BFS from uDummy to vDummy then we can get shortest path between an unmatched vertex in U to unmatched vertex in V. Due to bipartite nature of the graph, this path would zig zag from U to V. However we need to make sure that when going from V to U, we always select matched edge. If there is no matched edge then we end at vDummy. If <b>we</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> of this criteria during BFS then the generated path would meet the criteria for being an augmented shortest path.|$|E
500|$|The duo modeled their {{relationship}} on writers Billy Wilder and I. A. L. Diamond, but were much closer friends {{rather than just}} writing partners. They took the approach {{that they were in}} a band together and purposely studied teams to discover why they break up. Kurtzman later explained in 2009 that [...] "One big thing that makes the wheels start to wobble is when someone feels that the contribution isn't 50-50. <b>We</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> we live up to the partnership.

500|$|Co-creators J. J. Abrams, Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, and {{executive}} producer Jeff Pinkner wrote the episode. Paul A. Edwards served as the director, his first such credit for the series. In developing Fringe, the co-creators {{did not want to}} make the series too serialized, as this was a complaint often directed at Abrams' television series Alias. They wanted to find a balance between standalone stories and serialized content, and studied procedural dramas such as Law and Order and [...] for inspiration. Kurztman explained, [...] "While <b>we</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that our episodes are self-contained – have a beginning, a middle, and an end – the character stories can be serialized. They don't have to resolve themselves over the course of one show." [...] "The Same Old Story" [...] was Fringes first regular episode, and some journalists viewed it {{as an example of how}} the series would be structured.|$|E

On November 16, 1989, the US-armed Atlacatl Battalion in El Salvador assassinated six leading Latin American Jesuit priests, he explained. He contrasted the US' [...] "self-congratulation" [...] of the Berlin Wall destruction with the [...] "resounding silence" [...] that surrounds the assassination of these priests, contending that the US sacrifices democratic principles for its own self-interest, and without any self-criticism it tends to [...] "focus a laser light on the crimes of enemies, but crucially <b>we</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> to never look at ourselves." ...|$|E

6000|$|This, therefore, is {{our first}} {{requirement}} about the ideal towards which progress is directed; it must be fixed. Whistler used to make many rapid studies of a sitter; {{it did not matter}} if he tore up twenty portraits. But it would matter if he looked up twenty times, and each time saw a new person sitting placidly for his portrait. So it does not matter (comparatively speaking) how often humanity fails to imitate its ideal; for then all its old failures are fruitful. But it does frightfully matter how often humanity changes its ideal; for then all its old failures are fruitless. The question therefore becomes this: How can we keep the artist discontented with his pictures while preventing him from being vitally discontented with his art? How can we make a man always dissatisfied with his work, yet always satisfied with working? How can <b>we</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that the portrait painter will throw the portrait out of window instead of taking the natural and more human course of throwing the sitter out of window? ...|$|E
