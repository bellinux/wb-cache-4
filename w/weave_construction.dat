The Unweave the <b>Weave</b> <b>construction</b> project, completed between 2004 and 2008, disentangled I-694 and I-35E at Little Canada-Vadnais Heights. The project {{was designed to}} increase traffic flow, driver safety, and improve {{the condition of the}} roadway. Another construction project, the I-35W/US 10/I-694 North Central Corridor Reconstruction Project, also designed to unweave the highway, began in September, 2011. This project will eliminate the weaving movements of I-694 at its interchange with U.S. Highway 10 (US 10) and MN 51 in Arden Hills. This interchange often creates one of the worst bottlenecks in the Twin Cities because drivers need to change at least one lane to continue either direction on I-694 between MN 51 (Snelling Avenue) and US 10. When the construction project is completed, the roadway of I-694 will include three thru-lanes in each direction from I-35W at New Brighton to US 10 at Arden Hills; four thru-lanes in each direction from US 10 in Arden Hills to Rice Street at Shoreview-Little Canada; and five thru-lanes in each direction from Rice Street to the I-694-I-35E interchange, compared with the current two to three lanes throughout the I-694 corridor.|$|E

Technologically denim washing is the most important fashion element for clothing industry. Usually the term ‘washing ’ is most significantly applied in case of sewn apparels so it is very essential to observe the effects that have been made by particular washing on the fabrics to hold the qualities of sewn apparels. The aim of this paper is to determine the effects of sand blasting with industrial enzyme silicon wash on denim apparel characteristics. For this investigation currently fashionable regular denim (100 % cotton with twill 3 / 1 <b>weave</b> <b>construction)</b> trouser was chosen. The selected denim trouser has been processed by enzyme and silicon washes after sand blasting. In order to evaluate the washing effects on denim trouser, changes of fabric handle, fabric specification (ends/inch, picks/inch, surface density, warp & weft yarn linear density), fabric strength, seam strength & fabric stiffness has been determined after sandblasting with enzyme silicon wash...|$|E
40|$|A {{greater sense}} of {{objectivity}} for {{the reconstruction of the}} cloth drape as derived from the VP 8 analysis of the frontal image of the Shroud might be possible if the draping properties of the linen could be measured directly. To carry out appropriate draping tests, however, and any other textile performance tests upon the Shroud itself would necessitate cutting quite large samples, and its significant mutilation, in a way which would be unacceptable. In these circumstances the next best thing would be to carry out textile performance tests upon an accurate replica of the Shroud linen, then link and compare the results obtained with the nondestructive tests that have been made upon the Shroud itself. Shroud Replica An accurate replica of the Shroud linen was in fact produced by the Shirley Institute, Didsbury, Manchester, for the BBC's QED programme on the Shroud as televised in November 1982.

40|$|Kevlar has {{demonstrated}} {{the ability to}} protect well against ballistic threats but has low resistance to puncture. Correctional Kevlar has shown good resistance to puncture. However, the fabric is expensive, difficult to manufacture because of its tight <b>weave</b> <b>construction,</b> and has limited protection against ballistic threats. In an effort to produce materials that are less bulky, more flexible, and resistant to puncture, thermoplastic-Kevlar (TP-Kevlar) composites have been examined. Kevlar fabric was impregnated with thermoplastic film using a hot press to produce the composites. Static and dynamic puncture resistant properties of the TP-Kevlar composites were investigated using a National Institute of Justice (NIJ Standard 0115. 00) Stab Tower. The TP-films {{used in this study}} were polyethylene, Surlyn, and co extruded-Surlyn, which is a co extrusion of Surlyn and polyethylene. Response of the polyethylene (PE) -Kevlar composites, Surlyn-Kevlar composites, and co extruded (COEX) -Kevlar composites to spike and knife threats under static and dynamic conditions were compared with that of neat Kevlar. The infusion of thermoplastic films into the Kevlar fabric was shown to dramatically increase puncture resistance during quasi-static and dynamic testing with spikes. The TP-film type also made a difference when examining the resistance on a comparative basis of the TP-Kevlar targets. The TP-Kevlar composite targets showed more resistance to quasi-static spike testing than quasi-static knife testing. Weapon comparisons revealed that the TP-Kevlar composite targets had more resistance to dynamic knife testing than dynamic spike testing...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{investigation}} into woven textile structures and <b>weave</b> <b>construction</b> methodologies. The main question {{at the heart of}} this research is what are smart textiles and what role/s can weaving play in the creation of such textiles in the future? A critical review of the literature led to a grammatical investigation and interpretation of the term smart textiles, and as a result a key differentiator between superficial and deep responsivity in constructed textiles is made: the latter is henceforth used to describe the uniqueness of smart textiles. The thesis proceeds to explore the fundamental engineering of textiles as material systems and by doing so, provide clues as to how fabrics could themselves be considered smart. Through this exploration, an original ‘textile anatomy’ mapping tool is presented with the aim to enhance and deepen current understanding of textiles and represent them as material systems instead. The hybrid research methodology that governed this investigation is unique. It relies on the creative tools of Design while also inherently applies the investigative methods of Science, Technology and Engineering. Weaving is explored through processes of making as an approach to develop smart textiles following an extensive historical review revealing that although methods of weave production have much evolved, the weave structures themselves have not changed at all for thousands of years. A series of experimental case studies are presented, which seek to explore and challenge current limitations of weaving for the creation of a new generation of material systems. As part of this work, the role of additive manufacturing was challenged, but its role as substitute manufacturing technique for textiles was accordingly rejected. This research finds that since weaving has become solely dependent on its machines, the structures produced through these processes of manufacturing are governed by such same specifications and limitations. As a result, in order to step away from current constraints, new assembly methodologies need to be revised. This is particularly applicable within the context of future (smart) material systems, and micro and nano fabrication techniques...|$|E

The analysis encompassed physical and optical methods of testing. In this paper, newly developed methods, tools and programs will be presented for virtual imaging of the multi-filament woven fabric geometry with pore structure used to determine permeability and retention properties. Two methods are applied for the generation of virtual fabric. One method involves developing software that is able to model woven fabric in new condition {{from a series of}} realistic input parameters. In this step, deterministic and stochastic methods are combined to create the fabric’s geometry. The other method involves reconstruction/generation the 3 D woven geometry from sequences of 2 D cross section images. The results prove that the 3 D pore morphology of high density multi-filament fabric can be illustrated in correlation of the <b>woven</b> <b>construction</b> parameters. The developed methods for modeling and the CFD simulation of woven fabric build an important basis for determining the mechanical flow properties such as permeability and retention characteristics of filters and barrier textiles. Additionally, the effects of mechanical loads on the fabric morphology and on the permeability values will be analyzed by applying uniaxial and biaxial tensile loads to the fabric. The tests provide the basis for a realistic prediction to the effects of the machine and construction parameters on the fabric properties and the resulting permeability and retention. These predictions can aid in analyzing the suitability of a fabric for a specific application.

A design, fabrication, and test program showed that shaft impact resistance could be improved over the previously developed graphite composite design at a cost in shaft train rate savings. The shaft train weight savings of the most impact tolerant construction was 4. 0 % over the current aluminum shaft train.
