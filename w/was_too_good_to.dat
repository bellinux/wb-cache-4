5|$|By {{the time}} of season two's nineteenth episode, the writers had decided Helen's fate. Originally, the {{character}} {{was going to die}} on her wedding night, but the creative team felt they could use her more in the mythology. Gough explains the idea Helen still had Clark's blood, she knew his secret, and her relationship with Lex <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> write off. The creative team kept Helen's true motivations a secret to Vaugier, which the actress enjoyed because it allowed her to play the character as if there were no ulterior motives.|$|E
5|$|At 08:00, two {{formations}} 18 Bf 109s of I and III./JG 77, led by Major Siegfried Freytag, {{took off}} with their pathfinders. At the same time 23 Bf 109s of II./JG 77 took off. Around the Bocholt area they formed up {{with the other two}} Gruppen. Heading south and still north of Antwerp, JG 77 passed Woensdrecht airfield. It was home to No. 132 Wing RAF and its five Spitfire squadrons; No. 331 Squadron RAF, No. 332 Squadron RAF (Norwegian), No. 66 Squadron RAF and No. 127 Squadron RAF, and No. 322 Squadron RAF (Dutch). Some pilots from II./JG 77 either mistakenly believed it to be Antwerp, or thought the opportunity <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> pass up. Two German fighters were claimed shot down, and one pilot captured. However, none of the JG 77 casualties fit this description.|$|E
5|$|On 28 August 2007, it was {{announced}} that a bid from Sunderland had been accepted by Stoke, after Higginbotham had handed a transfer request to the club. Higginbotham wrote in his autobiography that Pulis would only authorise the deal if he handed in a transfer request. Higginbotham signed a four-year deal with Sunderland the following day, moving for a £2.5million fee, possibly rising to £3million dependent on appearances. He said that the chance to play Premier League football under Roy Keane <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> refuse. On 10 November 2007, Higginbotham scored the opening goal for Sunderland which was believed to come off his ear in a 1–1 draw with their Tyne-Wear rivals Newcastle United at the Stadium of Light. He was only a bit-part player by the start of 2008–09, and Keane allowed him to return to Stoke for the same fee that he had paid to Stoke.|$|E

5|$|Starr {{considered}} leaving Storm at {{that time}} to join Derry and the Seniors, but accepted a job with Tony Sheridan at the Top Ten Club on 30 December 1961, as Sheridan's offer of more money, a flat and a car <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> refuse. Starr's stay with Sheridan was short-lived, as he found Sheridan's habit of changing the set list without telling his backing group beforehand frustrating, so he rejoined the Hurricanes. On 5 February 1962, Best fell ill and the Beatles had to play a lunchtime concert at the Cavern and an evening concert at the Kingsway club in Southport. As the Hurricanes had no concert that day Starr played with them live on stage for the first time (although he had recorded with them in Hamburg).|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} due for release in June, {{but this was}} delayed until August to include {{material}} written after its completion which the band felt <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> leave off. Upon its release, the UK music press immediately warmed to the album, which also received Melody Maker 's Album of the Week accolade. The year ended with the band providing support for the Red Hot Chili Peppers at Wembley Arena and Manic Street Preachers at the Millennium Stadium. As of March 2003, the album has been certified gold shipping 100,000 units in the UK, with total counter sales standing at 110,000 as of February 2005. The album was Melody Makers #24 album of 1999, while Metal Hammer placed the album in at #6 and Kerrang! ranked it at #16.|$|E

Rankin explained his choice as a difficult one, but the opportunity of working with Allan Donald <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> miss. He was contracted to play in the controversial Indian Cricket League for the Kolkata Tigers; fellow Irishman, Niall O'Brien also participated in the tournament.|$|E

25|$|Finally, just a {{week before}} the season began and after only a year on Teesside, Luke Young moved to Aston Villa for a fee of £5.5 million rising to £6 million based on appearances. Fans were {{disappointed}} with the sale but, coupled with Young's wish to make the move, the club felt the offer <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> turn down, having only paid £2.5 million for him a year earlier. A replacement was brought in when Middlesbrough completed the £3 million signing of Arsenal's Justin Hoyte before {{the first game of the}} season, but not in time for him to be eligible to play. The right-back signed a four-year contract.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} time in 'Australian Idol' history there were 13 finalists. This came about during the Wildcard Verdict show on 5 September 2005. The judges {{initially}} chose James Kannis and Emily Williams to go through to the final. This left one spot which was chosen by the Australian public. Out of the remaining contestants the two that received the highest votes were Daniel Spillane and Roxane Lebrasse. With only 1% between them, Dan was announced as the final member of the Top 12. This meant Roxane had missed out yet again. The judges decided however that Roxane <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> be left out of the Top 12 so they made it a Top 13. The catch was that two contestants were eliminated {{in the first round of}} the finals.|$|E
25|$|Brabham quit Formula One {{at the end}} of {{that year}} to begin touring car racing – while he wanted to help Simtek the salary offered by the BMW works team <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> ignore. 1995 in a BTCC BMW was not a success, but {{subsequent}} successes included winning the 1996 JGTC GT500 championship in McLaren F1 GTR (so far the only non-Japanese team car to win this), and the 1997 AMP Bathurst 1000 in its Super Touring era. Driving a BMW 320i at Bathurst with brother Geoff, the pair were flagged in 2nd but were elevated to the win soon after the finish when their BMW Motorsport Australia teammates Paul Morris and Craig Baird were disqualified, the team making an error at the last pit stop by not doing a driver change and leaving Baird in the car for the run home, not realising that he would exceed his allowed driving time before the race ended.|$|E

25|$|The {{proposal}} {{to link the}} airport with a bridge had been previously approved by Toronto City Council in 1995 and 1998, {{with the proviso that}} a business plan would be presented for approval by the THC and later the TPA for operating the airport. In November 2002, City Council met to debate the competing proposals, that of closing the airport in favour of some parkland, or of approving the TPA's plans and having uncontested title to the port lands. Despite pleas from former mayor David Crombie, urban planner/activist Jane Jacobs and Harbourfront residents, the TPA plan was supported by then-mayor Mel Lastman, who argued that the estimated $190 million of annual economic benefit the airport would create, <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> pass up. On November 28, 2002, Council in a day-long debate, made two votes to settle the issue. First, Council voted 32–9 to accept a settlement to end the TPA port-lands lawsuit in exchange for an immediate payment of $5.5 million and an annual subsidy of $5.5 million to the TPA until 2012. Council then voted 29–11 to approve the amendment of the tripartite agreement to permit a fixed link and the construction of a lift bridge.|$|E

Husk is forgiven for her betrayal since she was of unsound mind and is made the Academy's new guidance counselor, however Toad is fired. As he is leaving Husk apologizes to him for being unable to remember what happened between them, he claims he knew it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> last. Before he leaves she arranges a date at a local coffee shop, but the city is attacked by self-replicating energy bots built by Maximilian Frankenstein so he and Manuel Endque could escape the Grey Academy.

Endque was found by the X-Men having been severely beaten by Toad on Frankenstein's orders, Toad seemingly now working for Frankenstein, wanting to go someplace nobody can hurt them. Endque passes on a message to Husk that Toad left because he knew even if things went well between them one day she'd wake up and see him for what he really was. Husk breaks down in tears.|$|E

500|$|A key plot {{point is}} {{fabricated}} {{for the purposes}} of dramatic irony: in the book, Marsh has his agent Sam Smith leave a Camarasaurus skull for Cope to find and mistakenly put on the wrong dinosaur. Instead, Hatcher finds it; Smith tries to keep an unwitting Marsh from getting it, but due to Marsh's obnoxious manner he lets him after all. As a result, Marsh mistakenly classifies the (non-existent) Brontosaurus. Ottaviani admits in the book he invented this, as [...] "the literary tradition of hoisting someone up by his own petard <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> pass up".|$|E

[...] "But when a cartoon becomes president, it starts to look too fake to be real, but too real to be a cartoon. Frank plays the role of President Bartlett, a cartoon president doing things that would actually, in reality, be kind of great. But Bartlett <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> be true, and the old Frank was too evil to be true. President Underwood is just too dull to be a fantasy, and so the props take center stage." ...|$|E
500|$|The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth is {{a revised}} and {{expanded}} version of The Lost Caverns of Tsojconth, a tournament adventure that Gygax wrote for WinterCon V, a gaming convention {{sponsored by the}} Metro Detroit Gamers (MDG) in 1976. It is {{based in part on}} one of Rob Kuntz's dungeon levels, as Kuntz helped Gygax revise the tournament version. [...] This original version consisted of eight loose sheets, an outer folder, and a zip-locked bag; only several hundred copies were printed. In the May 1980 issue of Dragon, Gygax said [...] "Rob Kuntz has the reworked Lost Caverns module which must be finalized" [...] and that [...] "We want to get it into print as soon as possible."

500|$|It {{was first}} {{reported}} {{shortly after the}} conclusion of the 2010 Tour de France that Andy and Fränk Schleck would leave , the team for which they had each ridden for the entirety of their respective careers, at the conclusion of that season.

Luxembourg real estate tycoon Flavio Becca was eventually revealed as the team's owner. Andersen and Nygaard sought him out in May 2010 for advice. Becca, a sports fan, had plans to form a new cycling team himself, and he offered Nygaard the position of general manager for his team, essentially combining their ambitions. Becca also brought Andersen on, giving the Dane a position as a sporting director. Fränk Schleck later revealed that he and his brother had {{had little to do with}} the formation of the team, being approached with the prospect of joining at the 2010 Tour of Luxembourg in June. Despite a good relationship with [...] manager Bjarne Riis, the brothers felt the opportunity to ride for a [...] "home-based team" [...] <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> pass up.
