5|$|Despite {{the heavy}} {{security}} after the 2016 election, {{there have been}} some detentions and arrests that have been related to the increased security at the tower. On December 6, a woman managed to bypass security and go to the 24th floor—two floors below Donald Trump's office—before being stopped by Secret Service officers. A week later on December 13, a Baruch College student who <b>was</b> <b>arrested</b> <b>at</b> Trump Tower was found to have multiple weapons, including knives, a garrote, and firecrackers. The next day, another man reportedly got angry after he wanted to meet Donald Trump at the tower, and after throwing a wine glass onto the floor of the tower's lobby, was subsequently detained by the NYPD.|$|E
5|$|Edith Chaykoski {{died from}} her wounds at Windsor Metropolitan Hospital at about 05:30 on 26 June. Police searched the {{neighbourhood}} {{during the morning}} and found the shotgun where Lamb had thrown it. They identified it as Hesketh's {{and concluded that the}} 18-year-old must have taken it and gone on a shooting spree the previous day. Lamb <b>was</b> <b>arrested</b> <b>at</b> 15:30 on 26 June and charged with the capital murder of Edith Chaykoski. Under the terms of Canadian law at that time, he faced a mandatory death penalty if convicted. When Woloch's injuries also proved fatal at 14:45 on 11 July 1966, his murder was added to Lamb's charge.|$|E
40|$|Precursor-B cell {{receptor}} (pre-BCR) signaling represents a crucial checkpoint at the pre-B cell stage. Aberrant pre-BCR signaling is {{considered as a}} key factor for B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) development. BCP-ALL are believed to <b>be</b> <b>arrested</b> <b>at</b> the pre-BCR checkpoint independent of pre-BCR expression. However, the cellular stage <b>at</b> which BCP-ALL <b>are</b> <b>arrested</b> and whether this relates to expression of the pre-BCR components (IGHM, IGLL 1 and VPREB 1) is still unclear. Here, we show differential protein expression and copy number variation (CNV) patterns of the pre-BCR components in pediatric BCP-ALL. Moreover, analyzing six BCP-ALL data sets (n = 733), we demonstrate that TCF 3 -PBX 1 ALL express high levels of IGHM, IGLL 1 and VPREB 1, and <b>are</b> <b>arrested</b> <b>at</b> the pre-B stage. By contrast, ETV 6 -RUNX 1 ALL express low levels of IGHM or VPREB 1, and <b>are</b> <b>arrested</b> <b>at</b> the pro-B stage. Irrespective of subtype, ALL {{with high levels of}} IGHM, IGLL 1 and VPREB 1 <b>are</b> <b>arrested</b> <b>at</b> the pre-B stage and correlate with good prognosis in high-risk pediatric BCP-ALL (n = 207). Our findings suggest that BCP-ALL <b>are</b> <b>arrested</b> <b>at</b> different cellular stages, which relates to the expression pattern of the pre-BCR components that could serve as prognostic markers for high-risk pediatric BCP-ALL patients...|$|R

5|$|Kinne <b>was</b> <b>arrested</b> <b>at</b> {{her home}} for the murder around 11 p.m. on May 31, the same night as Patricia Jones's funeral. The same day, the Jackson County Sheriff {{requested}} that prosecutors consider a second charge of murder, this one {{for the death of}} James Kinne. Kinne's lawyers, Alex Peebles and Martha Sperry Hickman, filed a writ of habeas corpus with the court the next morning, and a hearing that afternoon resulted in her release on $20,000 bond while she awaited a preliminary hearing originally scheduled for June 16.|$|E
5|$|On June 25, a tipster, who {{was later}} {{revealed}} to be Taylor's sister Laurie Galli, contacted Washington Terrace Police officer Marcia Gathercole with information connected to the murder. Taylor's fingerprints were found on a telephone in the King residence and matched to records provided by authorities in Fort Lauderdale. He <b>was</b> <b>arrested</b> <b>at</b> about 9 p.m. on June 28 {{at the home of}} his half-sister/incestous lover Tresa Taylor in Ogden, Utah and charged with first-degree burglary, first-degree child rape, and first-degree murder the next morning. Taylor had arrived from Florida four days before the murder and had been staying with another sister in the same apartment complex.|$|E

5|$|Gardstein's {{body was}} removed {{to a local}} {{mortuary}} where his face was cleaned, his hair brushed, his eyes opened and his photograph taken. The picture, and descriptions {{of those who had}} helped Gardstein escape from Exchange Buildings, were distributed on posters in English and Russian, asking locals for information. About 90 detectives vigorously searched the East End, spreading details of those they were looking for. A local landlord, Isaac Gordon, reported one of his lodgers, Nina Vassilleva, after she had told him she {{had been one of the}} people living at Exchange Buildings. Wensley questioned the woman, finding anarchist publications in her rooms, along with a photograph of Gardstein. Information began to come in from the public and the group's associates: on 18 December Federoff <b>was</b> <b>arrested</b> <b>at</b> home, and on 22 December Dubof and Peters were both captured.|$|E
5|$|Loughner, a 22-year-old Tucson {{man who was}} {{fixated on}} Giffords, <b>was</b> <b>arrested</b> <b>at</b> the scene. Federal {{prosecutors}} filed five charges against him, including the attempted assassination {{of a member of}} Congress and the assassination of a federal judge. Loughner previously had been arrested (but not convicted) once on a minor drug charge and had been suspended by his college for disruptive behavior. Court filings include notes handwritten by Loughner indicating he planned to assassinate Giffords. Loughner did not cooperate with authorities, invoking his right to remain silent. He was held without bail and indicted on 49 counts. In January 2012, Loughner was found by a federal judge to be incompetent to stand trial based on two medical evaluations, which diagnosed him with paranoid schizophrenia. Judged still incompetent to stand trial on May 25, finally on August 7, Loughner had a hearing at which he was judged competent. He pleaded guilty to 19 counts, and in November 2012 was sentenced to life in prison.|$|E
