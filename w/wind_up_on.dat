5|$|Marge forbids Bart and Lisa from {{watching}} the Itchy & Scratchy Halloween special, removing the batteries from the remote control. When Marge leaves, Bart finds plutonium in Homer's toolbox and hammers {{it into the}} remote's battery slot. When they use the remote, the kids enter the world of Itchy and Scratchy. Bart and Lisa are soon hunted by Itchy and Scratchy. Back in the Simpson house, Homer enters {{the living room and}} watches the show. Oblivious to what he sees, Homer decides to change the channel, and Bart, Lisa, Itchy, and Scratchy <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> Live with Regis and Kathie Lee. They end up back at Itchy's house and urge Homer from inside the TV to use the remote to get them out, who eventually succeeds in doing so. Unfortunately, Itchy and Scratchy also escape. At first, the family is scared, but realize how small the two characters are and decide to keep them as pets.|$|E
500|$|Dead animals {{may appear}} to have been tipped over. But this is {{actually}} the process of rigor mortis, which stiffens the muscles of the carcass, beginning six to eight hours after death and lasting for one to two days. [...] It is particularly noticeable in the limbs, which stick out straight. [...] Post-mortem bloat also occurs because of gas formation inside the body. The process may result in cattle carcasses that <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> their back with all four feet in the air.|$|E

I kept {{stressing}} to Jermaine , ‘I {{got to do something}} for the kids.’ I had talked about it on the last album – and there was a song that I had, and it wasn’t quite completed. And I talked about it to the papers, gay magazines, and it didn't <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the album with the cut-off date. I felt really badly about that. So he just handed me a CD and said, ‘Here are 10 tracks for the kids; tell me which one you like the best.’ I fell in love with 'Rock With U'." ...|$|E

500|$|Stephen King {{called the}} series [...] "a feat of which only a {{superior}} imagination is capable", and declared [...] "Rowling's punning, one-eyebrow-cocked sense of humor" [...] to be [...] "remarkable". However, {{he wrote that}} despite the story being [...] "a good one", he is [...] "a little tired of discovering Harry {{at home with his}} horrible aunt and uncle", the formulaic beginning of all seven books. King has also joked that [...] "Rowling's never met an adverb she did not like!" [...] He does however predict that Harry Potter [...] "will indeed stand time's test and <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> a shelf where only the best are kept; I think Harry will take his place with Alice, Huck, Frodo, and Dorothy and this is one series not just for the decade, but for the ages". Sameer Rahim of The Daily Telegraph disagreed, saying [...] "It depresses me to see 16 and 17 year-olds reading the series when they could be reading the great novels of childhood such as Oliver Twist or A House for Mr Biswas. What that says about the adults who are fanatical fans I’m not sure – but I suspect in years to come people will make a link between our plump, comfortable, infantilising society and the popularity of Potter." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dystheistic {{sentiment}} {{has also}} made its way into popular music, evincing itself in controversial songs like [...] "Dear God" [...] by the band XTC (later covered by Sarah McLachlan) and [...] "Blasphemous Rumours" [...] by Depeche Mode, which {{tells the story of}} a teenage girl who attempted suicide, survived, and turned her life over to God, only to be hit by a car, <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> life support, and eventually die. A good deal of Gary Numan's work, specifically the album Exile, is laden with misotheistic themes.|$|E
2500|$|Faked (or wrongly presumed) death, disgrace, banishment, {{and changed}} {{identity}} {{are of course}} major ingredients in Shakespeare's plays, and Stephen Greenblatt puts it fairly clearly: [...] "Again and again in his plays, an unforeseen catastrophe...suddenly turns what had seemed like happy progress, prosperity, smooth sailing into disaster, terror, and loss. The loss is obviously and immediately material, but it is also, and more crushingly, a loss of identity. To <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> an unknown shore, without one’s friends, habitual associates, familiar network—this catastrophe is often epitomized by the deliberate alteration or disappearance of the name and, with it, the alteration or disappearance of social status." ...|$|E

60|$|The sheep {{raised a}} {{dust-cloud}} in the sandy wash {{where the road}} wound down, and Lucy hung back to let them get farther ahead. Gradually the tiny roar of pattering hoofs and the blended bleating and baaing died away. The dust-cloud, however, hung {{over the head of}} the ravine, and Lucy had to force Sarchedon through it. Sarchedon did not mind sand and dust, but he surely hated the smell of sheep. Lucy seldom put a spur to Sarchedon; still, she gave him a lash with her quirt, and then he went on obediently, if disgustedly. He carried his head like a horse that wondered why his mistress preferred to drive him down into an unpleasant hole when she might have been cutting the sweet, cool sage <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the slope.|$|E
60|$|When a free shoot {{has grown}} far beyond its support, it sinks {{downwards}} from its weight, as already {{explained in the}} case of the Hop, with the revolving extremity turned upwards. If the support be not lofty, the shoot falls to the ground, and resting there, the extremity rises up. Sometimes several shoots, when flexible, twine together into a cable, and thus support one another. Single thin depending shoots, such as those of the Sollya Drummondii, will turn abruptly backwards and <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> themselves. The greater number of the depending shoots, however, of one twining plant, the Hibbertia dentata, showed but little tendency to turn upwards. In other cases, as with the Cryptostegia grandiflora, several internodes which were at first flexible and revolved, if they did not succeed in twining round a support, become quite rigid, and supporting themselves upright, carried on their summits the younger revolving internodes.|$|E
