She is attracted to Jake because of his bravery, though frustrated with him for <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>sees</b> as his naiveté and stupidity. She serves as Jake's love interest. The character, like all the Na'vi, was created using performance capture, and its visual aspect is entirely computer generated. Saldana has also signed on for potential sequels.|$|E
5|$|Believing that {{by taking}} {{in one of}} the Cortexiphan {{subjects}} they can stop the effects of another quake, a willing Lane from the parallel universe travels to the prime and is hooked to Walter's (John Noble) equipment. Olivia also hooks herself up, allowing her to communicate <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>sees</b> in Lane's mind. When the prime version of Lane attempts to get into the right position, Olivia is able to identify his location, and he is captured in time. However, despite disrupting the process for Lane, earthquakes continue across the world. Walter estimates that the next set of quakes will cause both universes to collapse.|$|E

Jenner is an executive producer of the show. The show focuses on Jenner's transition and how it affects her relationships with her family and friends. The show also explores how Jenner adjusts to <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>sees</b> as her job as a role model for the transgender community. In October 2015, the show was renewed for a second season, which premiered on March 6, 2016. The show tied for best Outstanding Reality Program at the GLAAD Media Awards in 2016.|$|E

5|$|Finding her mother's body, Buffy {{at first}} denies <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>sees,</b> {{to the point}} of imagining {{alternate}} realities. Whedon stated that these mini dream sequences were like documentaries; people who find their loved ones dead are desperate to imagine a different, better outcome, and they create fantasies that cause much more pain when they are forced to return to the harshness of reality. Later in the hospital, Buffy imagines what she {{might have been able to}} do to save Joyce, although the doctor tells her there was nothing to be done. Willow and Xander express anger and helplessness. Anya, new to mortality and human connections, is childlike in her innocence and questions. Xander's anger and Anya's confusion allow them to be mothered somewhat by Willow, who needs to take care of someone. Dawn is deeply in denial, unable to understand that the woman she thought she had known all her life was gone. Tara, who has gone through the ordeal before, represents the acceptance phase, soothing and helping the others to work through what they are experiencing. Buffy toward the end also begins to see acceptance when she tells Dawn that the body in the morgue is not their mother; Joyce is gone.|$|E

Sue confronts Ann about her resentment of Chris in a particularly volatile scene, revealing to Ann that the neighbors all think Joe is guilty.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary {{artists with}} synesthesia, such as Carol Steen and Marcia Smilack (a {{photographer}} who waits until {{she gets a}} synesthetic response from <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>sees</b> and then takes the picture), use their synesthesia to create their artwork. Brandy Gale, a Canadian visual artist, experiences an involuntary joining or crossing of any of her senses – hearing, vision, taste, touch, smell and movement. Gale paints from life rather than from photographs and by exploring the sensory panorama of each locale attempts to capture, select, and transmit these personal experiences.|$|E

When Lucy arrives at his apartment, she tells Henry that she is his daughter and that his family needs him, although Henry refuses to believe her and turns her away. The next day, Jacinda, Lucy's mother, shows up late for work at Cluck's Chicken, but quits when calling out her boss for his bad temper. When she returns to her apartment, she tells her roommate, about having quit her job, but is stunned to find that Lucy has snuck out without her knowledge. In Belfrey Tower, Jacinda's stepmother Victoria grows increasingly irritated with <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>sees</b> as Jacinda's irresponsibility, and plans on taking full custody of her granddaughter, all while buying out smaller businesses and raising rent to push the cursed inhabitants out of the neighborhood.|$|E
500|$|Roush {{also notes}} that {{the first two weeks}} show how Claire [...] "runs a charity with a brutally iron fist". While Frank is Machiavellian, Claire {{presents}} a woman urging on her husband's assertion of power in the image of Lady Macbeth. Hank Stuever of The Washington Post describes her as an ice-queen wife. She encourages his vices while noting her disapproval of his weakness saying [...] "My husband doesn’t apologize...even to me." [...] Nancy deWolf Smith of The Wall Street Journal describes <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>sees</b> of their relationship in the first two episodes as pivotal to the show's success: [...] "Benign though they may seem [...] and their harmless air is what makes the Underwoods so effective as political plotters [...] this is a power couple with the same malignant chemistry as pairs of serial killers, where each needs the other in order to become lethal".|$|E
500|$|In {{the later}} Tandy period (1946– 1949) and {{continuing}} throughout the 1950s, Nancy is depicted less {{frequently in the}} center of the action. The Ghost of Blackwood Hall shows an assertive Nancy leading more timid friends up the front steps of the haunted house, and marks a transition to later illustrations. From 1949 forward, she is likely to be observing others, often hiding or concealing herself. Her mouth is often open in surprise, and she hides her body from view. However, although Nancy [...] "expresses surprise, she is not afraid. She appears to be a bit taken aback by <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>sees,</b> but she looks as if she is still in control of the situation." [...] Many of these covers feature Nancy poised in the observation of a clue, spying on criminal activity, or displaying her discoveries to others involved in the mystery. Only occasionally is she shown in action, such as running from the scene of a fire, riding a horse, or actively sleuthing with a flashlight. At times she is only involved in action as her hiding place has been discovered by others. In most cases, more active scenes are used for the frontispiece, or in books after 1954, illustrations throughout the text drawn by uncredited illustrators.|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert, {{writing in}} the Chicago Sun-Times, awarded the film four out of four stars and praised the detail in the {{portrait}} of Johnny Marco, saying [...] "Coppola is a fascinating director. She sees, and we see exactly <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>sees.</b> There is little attempt here to observe a plot. All the attention is on the handful of characters, on Johnny." [...] A.O. Scott in The New York Times called the film [...] "exquisite, melancholy and formally audacious" [...] and said [...] "This {{is not a matter}} of imitation, but rather of mastery, of finding — by borrowing if necessary — a visual vocabulary suited to the story and its environment. If you pay close attention, [...] "Somewhere" [...] will show you everything." [...] Peter Bradshaw disagreed in The Guardian, awarding the film two stars from five. He praised the cinematic technique but said that the film resembled Lost in Translation too closely, lacked emotional depth and that even on second viewing [...] "the question of why we should really care or be interested remains tantalisingly unanswered"; the final shot failed to solve any emotional problems and [...] "really is one of the daftest things I have seen for a long time." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cultural critic Alice Echols {{describes}} {{the emergence of}} a lesbian separatist movement as a response to <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>sees</b> as homophobic sentiments expressed by feminist organizations like the National Organization for Women. Echols argues that [...] "...the introduction of (homo)sex troubled many heterosexual feminists who had found in the women's movement a welcome respite from sexuality". Echols considered separatism as a lesbian strategy to untie lesbianism from sex so heterosexual women in the feminist movement felt more comfortable.|$|E

Noting that Walker had been married to a Jew and had a half-Jewish daughter, and that The Color Purple was adapted as a film directed by Jewish filmmaker Steven Spielberg, Goldberg said: [...] "Alice Walker is not boycotting Jews. She is not even boycotting Israelis. She is boycotting the government of Israel. She is boycotting <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>sees</b> as state-subsidized symbols of racism that remind her of Apartheid South Africa." [...] To call Walker an anti-Semite, Goldberg said, was to [...] "devalue" [...] her own grandfather's suffering at Treblinka concentration camp.|$|E
2500|$|Overall, {{this book}} works to {{shed some light}} on what hooks sees as the modern day {{abandonment}} of love and what it means for people of today to experience love. One strong argument she proposes is how love cannot exist {{in the middle of a}} power struggle. Hooks goes as far as to present a number of problems she finds with our modern ideals of love and proposes their possible solutions. She includes the propositions of full reconstruction and transformation of modern-day love based on [...] "affection, respect, recognition, commitment, trust and care" [...] (Nonfiction Book Review). Hooks also points out <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>sees</b> to be the roots of the problems regarding modern day love, those being gender stereotypes, domination, control, ego, and aggression (Nonfiction Book Review).|$|E
2500|$|After being {{introduced}} by her daughter, Clinton accepted the Democratic presidential nomination on July 28, the final {{night of the}} convention.

Clinton discussed what her priorities would be as president, saying that creating jobs would be her [...] "primary mission," [...] {{and that she would}} also seek to combat climate change, make college more affordable, and institute new gun laws. Clinton contrasted her hopeful vision and specific policy proposals with <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>sees</b> as Trump's fearmongering and vague ideas; she quoted Jackie regarding men moved by fear and pride. Eyder Peralta of NPR also noted that Clinton's [...] "grounded" [...] speech contrasted with the [...] "soaring" [...] speeches of President Obama. To supporters of her rival Bernie Sanders, Clinton stated [...] "I want you to know, I've heard you," [...] complimenting their energy and passion.|$|E

2500|$|Julia Fish (born 1950) is an American {{artist whose}} {{paintings}} have a deceptive simplicity. She paints in oil on stretched rectangular canvases of varying size. By means of close observation of everyday subjectsleaves {{of a tree}} seen through a window, a section of floor tiles, an old fashioned light fixture she makes, as one critic says, [...] "quiet, abstract manifestations of observed realities." [...] She is a studio artist who paints not <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>sees</b> in an instant but rather what she observes continuously, day after day. The result, she says, {{is not so much}} temporal as durational. [...] Her paintings compress many instances of observation so as to become, as she sees it, [...] "a parallel system to a lived experience." [...] The paintings lack spacial orientation and, as a critic says, can [...] "be described as both highly realistic and abstract without compromising either term." [...] In 2008, Alan G. Artner, writing in the Chicago Tribune, said [...] "This is work of small refinements and adjustments. The world of everyday things generates it, but Fish's qualities of seeing and touch elevate the things to a plane on which they leave behind their humble character." ...|$|E
2500|$|Throughout Speak, Anderson {{represents}} Melinda's {{trauma and}} recovery symbolically. Barbara Tannert-Smith refers to Speak as a [...] "postmodern revisionary fairy tale" [...] {{for its use}} of fairy tale imagery. She sees Merryweather High School as the [...] "ideal fairy tale domain", featuring easily categorized characters—a witchy mother, a shape-shifting best friend, a beastly rapist. Mirrors, traditional fairy tale tools, signify Melinda's struggle with her shattered identity. After being raped, Melinda does not recognize herself in her reflection. Disgusted by <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>sees,</b> Melinda avoids mirrors. According to Don Latham, Melinda's aversion to her reflection illustrates acknowledgement of her fragmented identity. In fact, the only mirror Melinda can [...] "see herself" [...] in, is the three-way mirror in the dressing room. Rather than giving {{the illusion of a}} unified self, the three-way mirror reflects Melinda's shattered self. Likewise, Melinda is fascinated by Cubism, because it represents what is beyond the surface. Melinda uses art to express her voice. Her post-traumatic artwork illustrates her pain. The trees symbolize Melinda's growth. The walls of Melinda's closet are covered in her tree sketches, creating a metaphorical forest in which she hides from reliving her trauma. According to Don Latham, the closets in the story symbolize Melinda's queer coping strategies. Melinda uses the closet to conceal the truth.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{suggestion}} that the painting was not an original Gu Kaizhi painting, but a Tang Dynasty (618–907) copy, was made in a book written by Hu Jing (胡敬, 1769–1845) in 1816. [...] However, {{it was not until}} the 20th century that art historians determined on stylistic grounds that the painting cannot have been produced during the Jin Dynasty, and therefore cannot be an original work by Gu Kaizhi. [...] However, there is considerable divergence of opinion between experts as to when and where the painting was made, and whether it is based on an earlier work by Gu Kaizhi or not. [...] The prevalent opinion until recently has been that the painting was a copy of a Gu Kaizhi painting produced during the Sui Dynasty (581–618) or early Tang Dynasty. [...] A supporter of this point of view is Chen Pao-chen of National Taiwan University, who believes that the original painting must have been painted prior to 484 as she thinks that the scene of Lady Ban on the lacquer screen from the tomb of Sima Jinlong (died 484) must have been modelled on the same scene on the original Admonitions Scroll; but on the basis of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>sees</b> as copyist's errors in the details of the British Museum scroll, she concludes that the extant painting is a Tang Dynasty copy of an earlier work, probably by Gu Kaizhi.|$|E
