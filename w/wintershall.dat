40|$|The <b>Wintershall’s</b> Maria subsea project {{consists}} of three main pipelines to be installed. The scope of this thesis is to identify and evaluate different approaches to subsea commissioning of Maria’s three pipeline systems and select a commissioning mythology for each pipeline system and identify points for optimization. The pipeline commissioning in this thesis {{is defined as the}} dynamic part of making a system ready for operation. The three pipeline systems are a gas lift, a water injection, and a production pipeline system. Gas is intended for a well-lifting purpose, injected into the well stream downhole to decrease the density of produced oil. Water is injected to maintain reservoir pressure, increase production rate and extend field operating life. The production pipeline transports hydrocarbons to the Kristin production unit for processing. The pipeline systems are presented in this order with suggested commissioning procedures. To evaluate the different commissioning procedures, chemicals used and necessary equipment is also identified. An evaluation sheet has been designed for visualization and summation of evaluated points. This was used both to evaluate commissioning procedure and to identify points of optimization. Gas lift pipeline system The main objective to the gas lift system review was to find a suitable de-watering procedure. De-watering should be as cost effective as possible while achieving the specified dryness inside the pipeline. Three options of drying technique were identified, discussed, and evaluated. It was found necessary to divide the de-watering procedure into two steps for optimization. The two steps of the de-watering procedure are pig-sweep train combined with following nitrogen drying. A calculation has been performed to optimize the volumes used in the pig-sweep train. The selected procedure will optimize the drying efficiency and maintain integrity. Water injection pipeline system The main objective related to the water injection system was to identify and evaluate a procedure to remove air trapped in the pipeline. The main criteria are time efficiency and a good result. Two options were identified, displacement by foam pigs, and direct flushing. Both procedures were found viable, but the selected method for optimization is direct flushing. The necessary flow velocity for flushing has been calculated, and pump capacity is evaluated. The calculation found that the velocity of flushing should be at least 1. 2 m/s to provide a plug flow that will flush trapped air out of the pipeline. The flow calculation shows that one of the two pumps intended for use is sufficient to achieve the plug flow criteria. For optimization, both pumps should be run together for a more effective flushing effect. Production system The main objective to the production pipeline commissioning was to identify a commissioning procedure efficient on time and still preserve the integrity of the system. The main criterion is to perform a safe start-up and cause as little influence on the Kristin process system as possible. Four methods of commissioning were identified as viable. The preferred option of commissioning is to use a 250 m³ slug of diesel between displacement pigs to displace the production line and drive out residues of water. The diesel slug and pig train are suggested to be displaced by the first production of hydrocarbons...|$|R
2500|$|On 13 October 2005 Gazprom's export arm Gazprom Export {{signed a}} {{contract}} with German gas company Wingas, a joint venture of Gazprom and <b>Wintershall</b> (subsidiary of BASF), to supply [...] of natural gas per year for 25years.

2500|$|In June 2015, an {{agreement}} to build two additional lines was signed between Gazprom, Royal Dutch Shell, E.ON, OMV, and Engie. As {{the creation of a}} joint venture was blocked by Poland, on 24 April 2017, Uniper, <b>Wintershall,</b> Engie, OMV and Royal Dutch Shell signed a financing agreement with Nord Stream 2 AG, a subsidiary of Gazprom responsible {{for the development of the}} Nord Stream 2 project. According to the agreement, each of five companies will provide €950million, of which €285million should be paid in 2017. The loan from the five companies will cover 50% of the project costs of €9.5billion. The rest would be financed by Gazprom who remains the sole shareholder of Nord Stream 2 AG. [...] Although the pipeline has received no formal approvals from Denmark, Sweden and Finland, it is scheduled to become operational in 2019–2020.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2011 it was {{estimated}} that it would take at least 10 years to rebuild Libya's infrastructure. Even before the 2011 war, Libya's infrastructure was in a poor state due to [...] "utter neglect" [...] by Gaddafi's administration, according to the NTC. By October 2012, the economy had recovered from the 2011 conflict, with oil production returning to near normal levels. Oil production was more than 1.6 million barrels per day before the war. By October 2012, the average oil production has surpassed 1.4 million bpd. [...] The resumption of production was made possible due to the quick return of major Western companies, like Total, Eni, Repsol, <b>Wintershall</b> and Occidental. In 2016, an announcement from the company said the company aims 900,000 barrel per day in the next year. Oil production has fallen from 1.6 million barrel per day to 900,000 in four years of war.|$|E

50|$|In {{the field}} of exploration, <b>Wintershall</b> focuses on {{geological}} studies, geophysical surveys as well as seismic measurements. Reservoir modelling is used to make forecasts for production from each field and is then the basis of all investment decisions. There are four categories of production, which require different technologies: onshore crude {{oil and natural gas}} production, offshore crude oil and natural gas production, hydraulic fracturing and sour gas production. As well as primary and secondary methods of oil production which achieve a yield of 20-40%, <b>Wintershall</b> also makes use of so-called Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR), which can raise this to 30-60%. <b>Wintershall</b> applies steam flooding as one of its EOR methods. In addition, <b>Wintershall</b> is currently developing novel and innovative methods that could substantially improve the recovery rate of a reservoir.|$|E
5000|$|According to James Wright's Historia Histrionica (1699), Wintershall's {{career began}} in {{the final years of}} the period of English Renaissance theatre; he was likely a young member of Queen Henrietta's Men at the Salisbury Court Theatre in the 1637 - 42 years. During the theatre closure, 1642 - 60, <b>Wintershall</b> was one of the English actors who {{performed}} in Europe, mainly in The Hague and Paris, in the middle 1640s. <b>Wintershall</b> became involved in a lawsuit with fellow actor Andrew Cane in 1654. The suit involved a thirty-year-old debt of £40, between Richard Gunnell, builder of the Salisbury Court Theatre, and his actors, including Cane; <b>Wintershall</b> had married Gunnell's daughter Margaret in 1641 or 1642, so becoming involved in the dispute. (The outcome of the suit is not known). In 1659 <b>Wintershall</b> and a Henry Eaton paid a bond for a court appearance by Anthony Turner, who was in legal trouble for violating the prohibition against acting. (If <b>Wintershall</b> had been in Queen Henrietta's Men, Turner was a former colleague.) ...|$|E
