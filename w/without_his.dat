5|$|Giles' dream {{presents}} a choice: either {{to remain a}} father figure and Watcher to Buffy, or to begin his own life, represented {{by the presence of}} his girlfriend Olivia, who pushes an empty baby stroller. During this part of his dream, Buffy is dressed as a child, with pigtails, and is unable to throw a ball straight <b>without</b> <b>his</b> help and instruction, an indication of his fear that she will be unable to do her job <b>without</b> <b>his</b> guidance. Later, Olivia is seen weeping, while the baby stroller has been overturned and abandoned, signifying elements of his unfulfilled life, such as marriage and children. Later, in The Bronze, he is explaining the reason they are all being stalked and attacked, performing his job as Watcher, but his singing this information represents his unfulfilled longing to be a musician, something he's been exploring privately throughout the season.|$|E

5|$|Speyer's two {{principal}} legacies {{are the three}} deep-level tube lines of the London Underground, and the Promenade Concerts. The former {{might not have been}} built without the finance he raised with Yerkes, and would have struggled <b>without</b> <b>his</b> chairmanship. The latter may have failed in the early 20th century <b>without</b> <b>his</b> financial support. The tube lines now form the central sections of the Underground's Northern, Piccadilly and Bakerloo lines. After Speyer's funding of the Promenade Concerts ended, they were taken over by music publishers Chappell & Co. and, in 1927, by the BBC. The characters of Sir Hermann and Lady Aline Gurtner in E. F. Benson's 1919 novel Robin Linnet were based on Sir Edgar and Lady Speyer. Leanne Langley suggests that the character of Appleton, a villainous stockbroker, in John Buchan's The Thirty-Nine Steps may have been based on Speyer.|$|E

5|$|A {{decade after}} the fact, during {{the second round of}} child abuse allegations, Jackson's lawyers would file a memo stating that the 1994 {{settlement}} was made <b>without</b> <b>his</b> consent. A later disclosure by the FBI of investigation documents compiled over nearly 20 years led Jackson's attorney to suggest that no evidence of molestation or sexual impropriety from Jackson toward minors existed. According to reports, the Department of Children and Family Services (Los Angeles County) investigated Jackson beginning in 1993 with the Chandler allegation and again in 2003. Reports show the LAPD and DCFS did not find credible evidence of abuse or sexual misconduct.|$|E
5|$|A {{small number}} of Ju 87s were also {{retained}} for anti-shipping operations in the Black Sea, a role it had proved so successful in when operating in the Mediterranean.

On 6 October 1943 the most powerful flotilla in the fleet comprising the Leningrad class destroyers Kharkov, Besposhchadny and Sposobny were caught and sunk by dive -bombing. After the disaster, Josef Stalin decreed that no more ships were to pass within range of German aircraft <b>without</b> <b>his</b> personal permission.|$|E
