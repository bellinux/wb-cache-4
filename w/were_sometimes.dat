5|$|Ships <b>were</b> <b>sometimes</b> camouflaged in {{classical}} times. Mediterranean pirate ships <b>were</b> <b>sometimes</b> painted blue-gray for concealment. Vegetius records that Julius Caesar's scout ships were painted bluish-green when gathering intelligence {{along the coast}} of Britain during the Gallic Wars. Ships <b>were</b> <b>sometimes</b> painted deceptively during the Age of Sail, while both sides in the American Civil War camouflaged their ships, whether to run blockades or for night reconnaissance.|$|E
5|$|Classical Athenian girls {{probably}} reached menarche {{at about}} age fourteen, {{when they would}} have married. Girls who died before marriage were mourned for their failure to reach maturity. Memorial vases for dead girls in classical Athens often portrayed them dressed as brides, and <b>were</b> <b>sometimes</b> shaped like loutrophoroi (vases which held water used to bathe before the wedding day).|$|E
5|$|Controversy arose {{when the}} star was first awarded. It has {{received}} mixed reviews from food critics both while {{in its current}} incarnation, and while it was run by head chef Marcus Wareing. It was felt that the dishes <b>were</b> <b>sometimes</b> overcomplicated, and designed primarily to gain Michelin stars. The restaurant was named after the French wine Pétrus.|$|E
50|$|Femininity <b>is</b> <b>sometimes</b> {{linked with}} sexual {{objectification}} and sexual appeal. Sexual passiveness, or sexual receptivity, <b>is</b> <b>sometimes</b> considered feminine while sexual assertiveness and sexual desire <b>is</b> <b>sometimes</b> considered masculine.|$|R
50|$|Today, tinginys <b>is</b> <b>sometimes</b> {{produced}} using {{less expensive}} ingredients and with even easier methods. Cocoa <b>is</b> <b>sometimes</b> used {{in place of}} chocolate, and condensed milk <b>is</b> <b>sometimes</b> used in place of boiled, solidified milk.|$|R

5|$|Coonhounds existed as a {{distinct}} type by the mid-to-late 1800s. By 1885 a raccoon pelt sold for approximately 25 cents, a fair price for the time. Up to World War I raccoons were very common despite being hunted often, and <b>were</b> <b>sometimes</b> poisoned {{to keep them from}} destroying crops.|$|E
5|$|Early beefsteaks {{were held}} in a relaxed, men-only atmosphere, with diners sitting on crates and eating with their fingers off of rough, improvised tables in saloons, rental halls, or {{residential}} basements. Food and drink were {{the focus of the}} evening, and entertainment often consisted simply of those present telling stories and singing amongst themselves. Brass bands <b>were</b> <b>sometimes</b> hired.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{especially}} aggressive rams <b>were</b> <b>sometimes</b> blindfolded or hobbled. Today, {{those who}} keep rams typically prefer softer preventative measures, such as moving within a clear line to an exit, never turning their {{back on a}} ram, and possibly dousing with water or a diluted solution of bleach or vinegar to dissuade charges.|$|E

5000|$|Johan Peter Falk (26 November 1732 - 31 March 1774) was a Swedish {{botanist}} and an apostle of Carl Linnaeus. His {{first name}} <b>is</b> <b>sometimes</b> spelled [...] "Johann"; his middle name <b>is</b> <b>sometimes</b> spelled [...] "Pehr"; and {{his last name}} <b>is</b> <b>sometimes</b> spelled [...] "Falck".|$|R
5|$|On April 6, 1917, the U.S. Congress {{declared}} war on Germany and officially entered World War I. At the time, soldiers and sailors with Spanish surnames or Spanish accents <b>were</b> <b>sometimes</b> the objects of ridicule and relegated to menial jobs. However, Hispanics continued to join the military and serve their nation.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{conservation}} and the heritage value of exceptional historic landscapes {{were treated with}} {{a growing sense of}} urgency. Specialist gardens <b>were</b> <b>sometimes</b> given a separate or adjoining site, to display native and indigenous plants.|$|E
5|$|Smoke screens have {{continued}} {{to be used by}} attackers and defenders as a means of sowing confusion and hiding movements. During naval battles in the 18–19th centuries, shots <b>were</b> <b>sometimes</b> fired early so a defensive screen was erected before the ships converged, to spoil the aim of the enemy.|$|E
5000|$|The report {{provides}} {{a breakdown of}} aggregate positions held by three different types of traders: “commercial traders,” “non-commercial traders” and “nonreportable.” “Commercial traders” <b>are</b> <b>sometimes</b> called “hedgers”, “non-commercial traders” <b>are</b> <b>sometimes</b> known as “large speculators,” and the “nonreportable” group <b>is</b> <b>sometimes</b> called “small speculators.” ...|$|R

5|$|The beaches {{themselves}} were overlooked by pillboxes of various types. These <b>were</b> <b>sometimes</b> placed low {{down to get}} maximum advantage from enfilading fire whereas others were placed high up making them much harder to capture. Searchlights were installed at the coast to illuminate the sea surface and the beaches for artillery fire.|$|E
5|$|The word salary {{comes from}} the Latin word for salt. The {{reason for this is}} unknown; a {{persistent}} modern claim that the Roman Legions <b>were</b> <b>sometimes</b> paid in salt is baseless.|$|E
5|$|At least 802 prisoners {{attempted}} {{to escape from}} the Auschwitz camps, mostly Polish or Soviet prisoners fleeing from work sites outside the camp. 144 were successful. The fates of 331 of the escapees are unknown. A common punishment for escape attempts was death by starvation; the families of successful escapees <b>were</b> <b>sometimes</b> arrested and interned in Auschwitz and prominently displayed to deter others. If someone did manage to escape, the SS picked ten people at random from the prisoner's block and starved them to death.|$|E

5|$|Bush was {{described}} as having especially close personal relationships with Tony Blair of Great Britain and Vicente Fox of Mexico, although formal relations <b>were</b> <b>sometimes</b> strained. Other leaders, such as Afghan president Hamid Karzai, Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni, Spanish prime minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, and Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez, openly criticized the president. Later in Bush's presidency, tensions arose between him and Vladimir Putin, {{which led to a}} cooling of their relationship.|$|E
5|$|Dummy horses <b>were</b> <b>sometimes</b> used {{to deceive}} the enemy into misreading the {{location}} of troops. They were effectively used by Allenby during his campaigns in the east, especially late in the war. Evidence exists that the Germans used horses in their experimentations with chemical and biological warfare. German agents in the US are suspected of infecting cattle and horses bound for France with glanders, a disease which can fatally spread to humans; similar tactics were used by the Germans against the Russians, causing breakdowns {{in their ability to}} move artillery on the Eastern Front.|$|E
5|$|Gaps between {{lava flows}} <b>were</b> <b>sometimes</b> {{cut off from}} {{surrounding}} vegetation. These literal islands of habitat are called kīpukas, a Hawaiian name used for older land surrounded by younger lava. Carey Kīpuka is one such area in the southernmost part of the monument and {{is used as a}} benchmark to measure how plant cover has changed in less pristine parts of southern Idaho.|$|E

50|$|Marina's legend {{is similar}} to that told of another Portuguese saint, the virgin martyr Quiteria. Her legend <b>was</b> <b>sometimes</b> also {{confused}} with that of Margaret of Antioch, who <b>was</b> <b>sometimes</b> also called Marina.Due to a confusion with the popular figure of Wilgefortis, Liberata <b>is</b> <b>sometimes</b> represented as martyred on a cross.|$|R
5|$|Geysers are fragile {{phenomena}} and if conditions change, they may go dormant or extinct. Many {{have been destroyed}} simply by people throwing debris into them while others have ceased to erupt due to dewatering by geothermal power plants. However, the Great Geysir of Iceland has had periods of activity and dormancy. During its long dormant periods, eruptions <b>were</b> <b>sometimes</b> artificially induced—often on special occasions—by the addition of surfactants to the water.|$|E
5|$|In Ancient Greece, {{green and}} blue <b>were</b> <b>sometimes</b> {{considered}} the same color, and the same word sometimes described {{the color of the}} sea and the color of trees. The philosopher Democritus described two different greens: cloron, or pale green, and prasinon, or leek green. Aristotle considered that green was located midway between black, symbolizing the earth, and white, symbolizing water. However, green was not counted among the four classic colors of Greek painting – red, yellow, black and white – and is rarely found in Greek art.|$|E
5|$|In {{a typical}} day, each crew member divided {{his time between}} {{physical}} exercise, station assembly and maintenance, experiments, communications with ground personnel, personal time, and bio-needs activities (such as rest and eating). The crew's daily schedule usually operated on UTC; for example, a typical morning {{had been scheduled to}} begin with an electronic wake-up tone at about 05:00 UTC. But during the expedition, a more typical wake-up time was actually between 06:00 and 07:00 UTC. The crew's sleep habits <b>were</b> <b>sometimes</b> shifted to accommodate the schedules of visiting shuttles or resupply vehicles.|$|E
30|$|The terms “reconstruction” and “reformatting” <b>are</b> <b>sometimes</b> used synonymously but {{describe}} {{very different}} processes. Because they <b>are</b> <b>sometimes</b> confused, they <b>are</b> briefly reviewed.|$|R
50|$|Condition 1 above <b>is</b> <b>sometimes</b> {{referred}} to as compatibility with the metric, and condition 2 <b>is</b> <b>sometimes</b> called symmetry, cf. Do Carmo's text.|$|R
