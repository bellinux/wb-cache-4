5|$|Megan {{receives}} backlash from Kate for {{not following}} procedure, but clay found in both Lizzy and Joe's pockets match. Samantha realizes that Joe found {{the crime scene}} of Lizzy's murder; the tennis courts at her school. Kate and Megan study her body and find a hand impression on her back, which matches {{one of her friends}} Heather Clayton (Meg Chambers Steedle). Heather killed Lizzy after she broke her finger during a lacrosse game. Lizzy's body was found elsewhere, meaning Heather had help moving the body, so Megan finds out that Lou helped Heather. Lou also admits killing Joe, as he <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>too</b> close to the truth. After they arrest them, Megan revisits her mother Joan, asking to exhume her father’s body. Joan declines the request, telling Megan to leave him be. Megan and Samantha revisit Helen and Becky, revealing that Joe had an undiagnosed brain disorder, causing the emotional distance from the two, telling them that Joe helped solve the Lizzy Adler case.|$|E
25|$|Off-screen, {{the real}} Roly <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>too</b> old to appear {{regularly}} on television {{so it was}} decided that he should retire to live with his owner, Julia Smith. On 2 August 1995, Roly died following an operation for breathing problems aggravated by the 1995 heatwave.|$|E
25|$|While at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival, Chan {{announced}} that he was retiring from action films citing that he <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>too</b> old for the genre. He later clarified {{that he would not be}} completely retiring from action films, but would be performing fewer stunts and taking care of his body more.|$|E

25|$|At age nine, Mitchell {{contracted}} polio in an epidemic, and was hospitalised for weeks. No longer athletic, {{she turned}} her thoughts to her creative talent, and considered a singing or dancing career for the first time. By nine, she was a smoker; she denies claims that smoking has affected her voice. At 11, she moved with her family {{to the city of}} Saskatoon, which she considers her hometown. She responded badly to formal education, preferring a freethinking outlook, and was drawn to art, a pursuit often regarded as peripheral at the time. One unconventional teacher did manage to make an impact on her, stimulating her to write poetry, and her first album includes a dedication to him. In twelfth grade, she flunked out (though she later picked up her studies) and hung out downtown with a rowdy set until deciding that she <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>too</b> close to the criminal world.|$|E
25|$|In 1974 labour <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>too</b> {{expensive}} in France, and Meccano subcontracted {{the manufacture of}} some models to Auto Pilen s.a. in Spain. These models had already been made in France and were sold exclusively under the marque Dinky. When the Calais factory closed {{down some of the}} recent tools were sent to Liverpool where the models were produced with new baseplates. Some of these tools were later sent to Auto-Pilen where they were modified or updated before; being re-issued, however it is not known if the dies were modified by Meccano or by Pilen. These models were sold in France under the marque Dinky, they were clearly identified as Dinky and as MADE IN SPAIN on the base plate. In Spain they were sold as Pilen and marked as such. Pilen models, most of which were Dinky dies, were very popular and numerous in Spain and commonly sold in El Corte Engles and Galerias Preciados department stores.|$|E
500|$|The two {{began to}} {{disagree}} about the magazine's direction. Betts felt Vogues fashion coverage <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>too</b> limited. Wintour in turn {{thought that the}} stories with popular culture angles Betts was assigning were beneath readers, and began pairing Betts with Plum Sykes, whom Betts reportedly detested as a [...] "pretentious airhead." [...] Eventually, she left, complaining to The New York Times that Wintour had not even sent her a baby gift. Wintour wrote an editor's letter that complimented Betts and wished her well.|$|E

500|$|Jonathan Frakes {{appeared}} as Commander William Riker, and as with First Contact he directed the project. Brent Spiner starred as Lieutenant Commander Data. Spiner {{had asked for}} his character to be killed off in Insurrection because he was concerned that he <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>too</b> old to play the role. His copy of the script came with a note from the production team saying, [...] "Sorry, kill you later". The underwater scene required Spiner to wear more make-up than usual because {{it needed to be}} waterproof. LeVar Burton reprised his role of Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge; a month before the release of Insurrection he appeared in the role in a guest appearance in the Star Trek: Voyager episode [...] "".|$|E
500|$|Nordby spent a {{significant}} amount of time shooting [...] "the articulating jaw" [...] scene because they had [...] "ultimate control over how the light was hitting the head". He said, [...] "This so-called jaw shot became a pivotal point, because for four months of the post, the filmmakers thought the film <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>too</b> scary so MPC pulled back on the jaw and then they thought it wasn't scary enough." [...] Because of this, [...] "they pushed back and this jaw went back and forth quite a bit to help navigate where they wanted the tone on any given day". These different poses helped the two teams perfect the jaw scenes. [...] "From a marketing point of view, from all the test screenings they did", said Norby, [...] "there was a lot of work figuring out how to make this a scary film as well as a funny film." [...] Since the team was on a small budget, they [...] "relied more on skilled artists to think through shots rather than a brute force approach".|$|E
500|$|During {{his four}} years at Michigan, Woolfolk had what one {{reporter}} described as [...] "a strange love-hate relationship" [...] with Coach Bo Schembechler. Woolfolk noted at the time Schembechler is a [...] "tough coach", and it was [...] "not easy at all" [...] playing for him. Schembechler was often angered by Woolfolk's tendency to try to run around defenders rather than banging through them, resulting in Woolfolk being benched more than once. But Schembechler said Woolfolk [...] "came of age" [...] in the November 1980 Ohio State game. After Woolfolk's MVP performance in the 1981 Rose Bowl helped Schembechler to his first bowl game victory, Bo complimented Woolfolk's powerful performance, noting: [...] "Butch {{can be a real}} load." [...] By the 1981 season, Schembechler was a true believer in Woolfolk, saying: [...] "Today, I can say without reservation, that I'd rather go into a big game with Woolfolk at tailback than any other back in the country." [...] Woolfolk, too, concluded in the end that Schembechler was [...] "key" [...] to his success: [...] "He kept after me. He kept saying I <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>too</b> fancy. He kept saying, 'You're a big back, a fast back, and you ought to be running over people -- not trying to dance around them.'" ...|$|E

500|$|By 1962, Glock {{had persuaded}} the BBC {{management}} {{to increase the}} orchestra's budget to allow for joint principals in the string sections, to attract top musicians who could play in the BBC SO without having {{to give up their}} solo or chamber careers. The following season, he was able to engage joint principals for the wind section, including as Jack Brymer and Terence MacDonagh, formerly members of Beecham's celebrated [...] "Royal Family" [...] in the RPO. The problem remained that recruiting rank-and-file string players was difficult: although the BBC offered secure employment and a pension, it did not pay as well as its London rivals. After 1964, the BBC SO {{was the only one of}} the five London symphony orchestras that was not self-governed, and some musicians felt that the BBC SO's constitution as a body of salaried employees, with no say in the management or repertory of the orchestra, attracted an unadventurous type of player. A former member of the BBC SO said in 1979, I felt I <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>too</b> secure ... the BBC Symphony you can be a poor player, but if you're on time and never moan at the conductor … you'll have no trouble... I think the BBC Symphony lost some good young players because the management got their priorities wrong.|$|E

2500|$|Allen {{was forced}} to retire when he turned 70 in 1956, because he <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>too</b> [...] "old". Allen had {{recruited}} legendary Wilt Chamberlain to Kansas, but would not get to coach him because freshmen were not eligible to play varsity basketball in 1956.|$|E
2500|$|Adoro {{expressed}} the belief {{of some people}} that the band <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>too</b> old, {{and that it was}} [...] "selfish" [...] for the band to continue, likely referring to comments about how it's time for other bands, besides Eraserheads, to shine. The band made it clear, though, that Buendia's departure from the band wasn't in any way violent {{and that there was no}} shouting (sigawan) or any confrontation involved.|$|E
2500|$|Pre-production for Series 6 {{started in}} September 2003 and a script for a Tribe movie was written {{and put on}} the market. However, Nick Wilson, of Channel 5, and Raymond Thompson {{eventually}} decided that although [...] "the show was still performing well, [...] felt that the cast <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>too</b> old [...] it was beginning to stretch the core proposition." [...] The cast and crew members went on to work on other productions.|$|E

2500|$|One of Sagan's harshest critics, Harold Urey, {{felt that}} Sagan <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>too</b> much {{publicity}} for a scientist and was treating some scientific theories too casually. Urey and Sagan {{were said to}} have different philosophies of science, according to Davidson. While Urey was an [...] "old-time empiricist" [...] who avoided theorizing about the unknown, Sagan was by contrast willing to speculate openly about such matters. Fred Whipple wanted Harvard to keep Sagan there, but learned that because Urey was a Nobel laureate, his opinion was an important factor in Harvard denying Sagan tenure.|$|E
2500|$|Wal {{plays for}} the Raupo rugby club as a hooker and is often seen playing and {{training}} in the strip. At one point Wal {{was replaced by a}} younger man as he <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>too</b> old, but the younger player wasn't as good. The final few strips ever drawn involve an unlikely chain [...] of events which culminate in Wal somehow scoring a try against a touring international rugby side. Wal also coaches the Raupo School rugby team, with Rangi being one of its more prominent members and the Dog serving as mascot (a duty he takes seriously, often blaming himself if the team loses).|$|E
2500|$|Simmons and Stanley did not renew Criss' {{contract}} when it {{expired in}} March 2004. Criss, on his website, stated that [...] "No one, again, {{no one has}} called me, or my attorney about an extension for future touring. As a founding member I find this to be disrespectful to me, and to the fans that have made us {{one of the biggest}} bands in the world." [...] Criss stated in a radio interview in 2004 with Eddie Trunk that Simmons and Stanley were going to start a new Kiss, and felt that he <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>too</b> old to play the drums for two hours (Criss was almost 59 at this time).|$|E
