When it came to casting, Waston had initially wanted actress Rebecca Gibney to play the role. However, she joined the cast of children's television series Zoo Family instead. Elaine Smith had previously made several small appearances in various established television series. In 1984, she came in to Neighbours to audition for a guest role and her short, spiky haircut caught the attention of the casting director. Smith told Hilary Kingsley, author of Soap Box, [...] "The casting director of Neighbours was looking some outrageous image for Daphne, this stripper – he didn't quite know what, but my haircut was it!" [...] Smith revealed that the idea of playing a stripper amused her and quipped that Daphne was the only stripper <b>who</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> to take her clothes off.|$|E

About the events of 5–6 October 1789, when the royal family was marched from Versailles to Paris by a group of angry housewives, Burke praised Queen Marie Antoinette {{as a symbol of the}} refined elegance of the ancien régime, who was surrounded by [...] "furies from hell, in the abused shape of the vilest of women".

500|$|The {{script for}} the pilot episode {{was the basis for}} the casting procedure, with little {{indication}} where the show went afterwards. This resulted in some preliminary casting disagreements between the creators and producers, especially for leading characters such as Ben, Brother Justin and Sofie. The character of Ben was always intended to be the leading man and hero of the series, yet he was also desired to display a youthful, innocent and anti-hero quality; Nick Stahl had the strongest consensus among the producers. The character of Sofie was originally written as more of an exotic gypsy girl, but Clea DuVall, a movie actor like Stahl, got the part after four auditions. Tim DeKay was cast as Jonesy because the producers felt he best portrayed a [...] "very American" [...] looking baseball player of that period.

500|$|For the 1970 U.S. Senate {{election}} from Michigan, state Republicans {{were looking}} for someone to run against Democrat Philip Hart, a two-term incumbent. [...] Hart was heavily favored to win re-election, but Republicans thought he might be vulnerable on ideological grounds (for being too liberal) and owing to an anti-war protest arrest involving his wife. [...] George Romney's name was mentioned as a possible candidate. Indeed, Nixon, <b>who</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> good relations with Romney either personally or on policy grounds, had by then decided he wanted Romney out of his administration but did not want to fire him, and hatched a plot to get Romney to run in the Senate race. [...] However, George {{came up with the idea}} of Lenore running, and sprung it on Lenore and the children at the end of 1969. [...] Lenore's name began being mentioned by other Republicans, even though she professed not to want to run unless no other candidate could be found. [...] U.S. House Minority Leader Gerald Ford from Michigan thought she could unite the state party's different factions, but Governor William Milliken, who had succeeded George and was not eager to see more Romneys in power, opposed the notion. [...] And while Lenore had achieved a good reputation for campaigning on her husband's behalf, there were some who suspected that her Senate candidacy was just a stalking horse for keeping George's options open. [...] Such sentiments were exacerbated when George did not completely rule himself out of a possible race.|$|E

Nick Stahl had the strongest consensus among the producers to portray the leading man and hero of the series with a youthful, innocent and anti-hero quality. The character of Sofie was originally written as more of an exotic gypsy girl, but Clea DuVall, a movie actress trying to become involved in regular television, got the part after four auditions. Tim DeKay, who had previously worked with Daniel Knauf on a pilot episode of a different project, was cast as Jonesy because the producers felt he best portrayed a [...] "very American" [...] looking baseball player of the 1930s period. Debra Christofferson impressed the producers with her first and only audition, playing Lila as Lodz's lover instead of his best friend as the script had implied. Adrienne Barbeau (Ruthie) was cast after her first audition as well, although she had originally expected to be cast as Apollonia. She learned to snake-dance afterwards. Brian Turk's role as Gabriel was originally intended to be a mute character described as [...] "a mildly retarded strongman with the face of an angel", but the writers later gave Turk a speaking part to not have another mute character like Management and Apollonia. One of the only actors <b>who</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> any real competition was Michael J. Anderson as Samson, whom Daniel Knauf had wanted as early as the initial casting meeting; Samson, Knauf's favorite character, was inspired by Knauf's father.|$|E
