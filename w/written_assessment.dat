Pupils are given regular reports to grade their progress; however {{the way in which}} this is done varies between schools. For example, a numerical grade could be given, or an oral and <b>written</b> <b>assessment</b> may be given.|$|E
50|$|The oral {{assessment}} also varies for Generalists and Specialists.

50|$|Because <b>writing</b> <b>assessment</b> {{is used in}} {{multiple}} contexts, the history of <b>writing</b> <b>assessment</b> can be traced through examining specific concepts and situations that prompt major shifts in theories and practices. <b>Writing</b> <b>assessment</b> scholars do not always agree {{about the origin of}} <b>writing</b> <b>assessment.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Some {{scholars}} in <b>writing</b> <b>assessment</b> focus their {{research on the}} influence of race on the performance on <b>writing</b> <b>assessments.</b> Scholarship in race and <b>writing</b> <b>assessment</b> seek to study how categories of race and perceptions of race continues to shape <b>writing</b> <b>assessment</b> outcomes. However, {{scholars in}} <b>writing</b> <b>assessment</b> recognize that racism in the 21st century is no longer explicit, but point out that <b>writing</b> <b>assessment</b> practices are silently racist. Nicholas Behm and Keith D. Miller in [...] "Challenging the Frameworks of Color-Blind Racism: Why We Need a Fourth Wave of <b>Writing</b> <b>Assessment</b> Scholarship" [...] advocate for the recognition of another wave after the three that Yancey offers. Behm and Miller advocate for a wave where the intersections of race and <b>writing</b> <b>assessment</b> are brought to the forefront of assessment practices. As the authors explain, racial inequalities in <b>writing</b> <b>assessment</b> are typically justified with non-racial reasons.|$|R

40|$|This article {{attempts}} {{to describe the}} condition of direct <b>writing</b> <b>assessment</b> literature. Instead of focusing on a particular assessment concept, issue or methodology, this review reflects the concerns evident within the bulk of work done on <b>writing</b> <b>assessment</b> since its adoption during the last fifteen years. The purpose of this work is to provide an overall sense of how assessment research defines the important issues and creates the trends that seek to inform efficient and accurate <b>writing</b> <b>assessment</b> procedures. Focusing on topic selection and task development, the relationship between textual features and quality ratings, and the influences upon raters'judgments of writing quality, this essay presents direct <b>writing</b> <b>assessment's</b> own preoccupations and concerns. The center of attention is not only on how direct evaluation has progressed but where it is heading. This large picture of direct <b>writing</b> <b>assessment,</b> available through an examination of its literature, is important {{to an understanding of}} direct <b>writing</b> <b>assessment</b> as the primary instrument in making decisions about the quality of student <b>writing.</b> <b>Writing</b> <b>assessment</b> was long considered a problematic area for those who teac...|$|R

50|$|In Iceland, {{assessment}} and evaluation of pupils is conducted internally, and is not standardised between different institutions.

50|$|The Social Case Study Report (SCSR) is a <b>written</b> <b>assessment</b> {{conducted}} by a licensed social worker as to the child's social, economic, cultural, and psychosocial background, as well as details about the abandonment or neglect of the child. The report should also contain {{the efforts of the}} social worker to locate the child's biological parents/relatives.|$|E
30|$|Regarding {{the second}} {{research}} question, the participating teachers’ <b>writing</b> <b>assessment</b> ability was concerning too because their grading was not accurate. As {{the data from}} the questionnaire revealed, the teachers were not familiar with the journals in the field of second language writing. Consequently, they do not keep abreast of current developments in second language teaching. They also expressed dissatisfaction with having no access to the journals and not having the chance to attend <b>writing</b> instruction and <b>assessment</b> courses. Given {{that a majority of the}} teachers had no broad background and expertise in teaching and assessing writing, the result of the teachers’ <b>writing</b> <b>assessment</b> should come as no surprise. Therefore, we should offer <b>writing</b> <b>assessment</b> courses for teachers to improve their <b>writing</b> <b>assessment</b> literacy.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} use of hermeneutics in reconsidering the role of <b>writing</b> <b>assessment</b> in composition. The traditional view of <b>writing</b> <b>assessment</b> is negative. In order to change this traditional view and enable composition faculty to utilize <b>writing</b> <b>assessment</b> and a valuable and necessary tool, a hermeneutic sphere offers the best framework upon which to recast <b>writing</b> <b>assessment</b> as part of composition and writing. A hermeneutic sphere is an interpretive methodology that allows for the investigation of any and {{all aspects of the}} subject at hand – in this case, <b>writing</b> <b>assessment.</b> The hermeneutic sphere works much like a heuristic in that it addresses questions, questions that lead to interpretations, reinterpretations, directions and brings the various components of <b>writing</b> and <b>assessment</b> together in order to create assignments and assessments that reflect the values of each program or institution. Emphasis is on open exploration, analysis, and reflexiveness as a way to create assignments and assessments that most reflect the values and beliefs of the faculty, the program, department, college, institution, nation, or world. ...|$|R

50|$|Quick Recall competitions, {{along with}} Future Problem Solving and Written Assessments (tests on subject areas) are all played on District, Regional, (all three school levels) and State Finals (middle {{and high school}} {{students}} only). Kentucky's state tournament is called Governor's Cup. KAAC divides Governor's Cup into three areas: Quick Recall, <b>Written</b> <b>Assessment,</b> and Future Problem Solving. Teams receive points for performance in the tests (Written Assessments), wins in the quick recall rounds, and placement in FPS. The team with the most points wins the tournament. The <b>Written</b> <b>Assessment</b> categories are as follows: Mathematics, Science, Social Studies, Language Arts, Arts and Humanities, and Composition. Language Arts has a focus work that is sometimes given to the students beforehand so they can obtain a copy and read it. If not, there will be no designated focus work. 20% of the LA test questions are related to that focus work or its author. Composition consists of a timed essay on a given topic.|$|E
50|$|The quick {{recognition}} of a word would potentially be important during a timed <b>written</b> <b>assessment.</b> With a strict limit on time available to complete a test, the presence of higher frequency words on the assessment would be more beneficial to the test-taker than low frequency words, as the high frequency words would be recognized faster and thus time could be utilized on {{other areas of the}} assessment.|$|E

5000|$|Like his books, McKelvey’s journal article [...] "The Law School Review, 1887 - 1937", which {{originally}} {{appeared in}} the Harvard Law Review, is available at libraries, in full text via on-line databases.
