40|$|Abstract-Study design: A {{retrospective}} study designed {{to evaluate the}} effect <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>shoe</b> lift on the lumbar scoliosis associated with pelvic obliquity. Objectives: To analyze the changes in pelvic height, Cobb angle and clinical manifestations after application <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>shoe</b> lift. Summary <b>of</b> Literature Review: The {{most common form of}} scoliosis in adolescence is idiopathic (85 % of scoliosis), which is <b>a</b> form <b>of</b> structural scoliosis. Some non-structural scoliosis may be assessed as an idiopathic form, which can result in an unnec-essary treatment, such as bracing. Pelvic obliquity may be <b>a</b> cause <b>of</b> non-structural scoliosis, and <b>a</b> <b>shoe</b> lift may be used for its correction. Materials and Methods: Twelve cases of lumbar scoliosis associated with pelvic obliquity, between April, 1998 and October, 2002, were investigated for the changes in the pelvic height and Cobb angle. Standing T-L AP and standing pelvic AP for measuring the Cobb angle and pelvic obliquity, respectively, were checked before and after application <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>shoe</b> lift. The Bell-Thompson method was used for measuring the limb length discrepancy. The shoe lift was composed <b>of</b> <b>a</b> compact cork pad and soft sponge tissue. The extent <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>shoe</b> lift was determined {{with the use of the}} most comfortable wood block height on stand-ing still. The radiological and clinical outcomes of the shoe lift were investigated. Results: After the introduction of the shoe lift, 9 cases (75 %) achieved a leveled pelvis (height difference less than 0. 3 cm) 1 wee...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} two numerical invariants, {{the waist}} and the trunk <b>of</b> knots. The <b>waist</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> closed incompressible surface in the complement <b>of</b> <b>a</b> knot {{is defined as the}} minimal intersection number of all compressing disks for the surface in the 3 -sphere and the knot. Then the <b>waist</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> knot is defined as the maximal <b>waist</b> <b>of</b> all closed incompressible surfaces in the complement of the knot. On the other hand, the trunk <b>of</b> <b>a</b> knot is defined as the minimal number of the intersection of the most thick level 2 -sphere and the knot over all Morse positions of the knot. In this paper, we obtain an inequality between {{the waist and}} the trunk of knots and show that the inequality is best possible. We also define the supertrunk <b>of</b> <b>a</b> knot and relate it to the hull number and the 3 -width. Comment: 11 pages, 3 figures. In v 2, Theorem 1. 9 was adde...|$|R
