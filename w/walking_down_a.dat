5|$|The {{scene in}} which Dorothy appears naked outside was {{inspired}} by a real-life experience Lynch had during childhood when he and his brother saw a naked woman <b>walking</b> <b>down</b> <b>a</b> neighborhood street at night. The experience was so traumatic to the young Lynch that it made him cry, and he had never forgotten it. Principal photography of Blue Velvet began in February 1986 and completed in April. The film was shot at EUE/Screen Gems studio in Wilmington, North Carolina, which also provided the exterior scenes of Lumberton. The scene with a raped and battered Dorothy proved to be particularly challenging. Several townspeople arrived to watch the filming with picnic baskets and rugs, against the wishes of Rossellini and Lynch. However, they continued filming as normal, and when Lynch yelled cut, the townspeople had left. As a result, police told Lynch they were no longer permitted to shoot in any public areas of Wilmington.|$|E

During the second verse, she similarly witnesses an older man, who is sitting on a withered stoop.|$|E

Mathieu Daigle stepping out of the forest, crossing a street, and entering another wooded area that bordered the backyards of several houses.

50|$|In {{film and}} video, a cutaway shot is the {{interruption}} of a continuously filmed action by inserting {{a view of}} something else. It is usually, although not always, followed by a cut {{back to the first}} shot, when the cutaway avoids a jump cut. The cutaway shot does not necessarily contribute any dramatic content of its own, but is used to help the editor assemble a longer sequence. For this reason, editors choose cutaway shots related to the main action, such as another action or object in the same location. For example, if the main shot is of <b>a</b> man <b>walking</b> <b>down</b> <b>an</b> alley, possible cutaways may include a shot of a cat on a nearby dumpster or a shot of a person watching from a window overhead.|$|R
