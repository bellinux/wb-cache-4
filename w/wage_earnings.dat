40|$|Year-to-year economy-wide {{measures}} of income distribution, {{such as the}} Gini coefficient, are rarely available for long periods except in a few developed countries, {{and as a result}} few analyses of year-to-year changes in inequality exist. But <b>wage</b> and <b>earnings</b> data by industrial sectors are readily available for many countries over long time frames. This paper proposes the application of the between-group component of the Theil index to data on <b>wages,</b> <b>earnings,</b> and employment by industrial classification in order to measure the evolution of <b>wage</b> or <b>earnings</b> inequality through time. We provide formal criteria under which such a between-group Theil statistic can reasonably be assumed to give results that also track the (unobserved) evolution of inequality within industries.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the mobility of}} individuals through the <b>wage</b> and <b>earnings</b> distributions. This is of extreme importance since mobility has a direct implication for the way one views the vast changes in <b>wage</b> and <b>earnings</b> inequality in the United States {{over the last few}} decades. The measures of <b>wage</b> and <b>earnings</b> mobility analyzed are based on data for individuals surveyed in the National Longitudinal Survey for Youth from 1979 to 1991. We introduce summary measures of mobility computed over varying time horizons in order to examine how the effect on measured inequality as the time horizon is increased. The results suggest that mobility is predominantly within group mobility and increases most rapidly when the time horizon is extended up to four years, reducing wage inequality by 12 - 26 %. We proceed therefore with more detailed examination of short-term (year-to-year) within group mobility, by estimating non-parametrically transition probabilities among quintiles of the distribution. We find that the staying probabilities, by quintiles, were higher at the higher quintiles throughout the period for both <b>wages</b> and <b>earnings,</b> and that mobility is declining over time. Hence, this paper suggests that while the level of wage inequality in the United States is somewhat lower once mobility is taken into account, the sharp increase in inequality during the 1980 's is worse than it appears, due to falling mobility over time. ...|$|R

50|$|Three key {{interventions}} {{were discussed}} and disseminated; ventilation by enlarging windows or opening eaves spaces, adding smoke hoods over the cooking area, or {{the option of}} installing an improved cook stove such as the Upesi stove. Smoke hoods are free-standing units that act like flues or chimneys {{in their effort to}} draw smoke out of the dwelling. They can be used over traditional open fires and this study showed they contribute to considerably lower levels of IAP. The smoke hood models were made with hard manila paper and then transferred to heavy-gauge galvanized sheet metal and manufactured locally. This resulted in further employment opportunities for the artisans who were trained by the project. The Upesi stove, made of clay and kiln-fired, was developed by Practical Action and East African partners to utilize wood and agricultural wastes. Because this stove was designed and adapted for local needs it produced several winning features. Not only does it cut the use of fuel-wood by approximately half, and reduce exposure to household smoke, it also empowers local women by creating employment as {{they are the ones who}} make and market the stoves. These women's groups gain access to technical training in production and marketing and enjoy higher <b>wage</b> <b>earnings</b> and improved social status as a result of the introduction of this improved stove.|$|E

We present an empirical analysis of inequality that specifically considers the path from individual <b>wages</b> and <b>earnings,</b> to household earnings, after-tax income, and finally consumption. We find that household earnings inequality rose substantially over this period. Inequality in disposable income and in consumption also rose over this period but to a lesser extent, suggesting taxes and transfers as well as insurance channels available to households help to insulate household consumption from shocks to wages. We find the same pattern in inequality trends when we look over {{the life cycle of}} households as we do over time in the economy.

When dealing with economic inequality as a research subject the question "inequality of what among whom" arises.

5000|$|An {{example of}} direct forces of {{economic}} oppression is employment {{discrimination in the}} form of the gender pay gap. Restrictions on women's access to and participation in the workforce like the wage gap is an “inequality most identified with industrialized nations with nominal equal opportunity laws; legal and cultural restrictions on access to education and jobs, inequities most identified with developing nations; and unequal access to capital, variable but identified as a difficulty in both industrialized and developing nations”. In the United States, the median weekly earnings for women were 82 percent of the median weekly earnings for men in 2016. Some argue women are prevented from achieving complete gender equality in the workplace because of the “ideal-worker norm,” which “defines the committed worker as someone who works full-time and full force for forty years straight,” a situation designed for the male sex. Women, in contrast, are still expected to fulfill the caretaker role and take time off for domestic needs such as pregnancy and ill family members, preventing them from conforming to the “ideal-worker norm.” With the current norm in place, women are forced to juggle full-time jobs and family care at home. Others believe that this difference in <b>wage</b> <b>earnings</b> is likely due to the supply and demand for women in the market because of family obligations. Eber and Weichselbaumer argue that “over time, raw wage differentials worldwide have fallen substantially. Most of this decrease is due to better labor market endowments of females." ...|$|E
50|$|An {{integral}} part of anyone’s ability to obtain a job lies {{in his or her}} skills and ability to perform that job successfully and efficiently. And beyond simply attaining a job, the skills they are able to acquire over time along with the skills they possessed previously also affect their wages once they have a job. However, it is difficult to discuss the role of skill in the workplace without discussing its relationship to racial and gender discrimination. The sections on discrimination will talk about more specifically about how the ability to get hired and the gaps in wages are affected by race and gender, but in the context of skill, the two relate in the context of educational opportunities and resources. In nationwide studies, skill supply can often be incorrectly measured because people assume that any standard level of educational achievement (such as high school graduate) should provide a common standard for skill; however, minorities that only have access to local, less academically rigorous schools are likely to be less skilled than whites that are at the same standard educational level. Furthermore, differences in wages between racial groups can be attributed to differences in skill that began during early education. According to human capital theory, there is a positive correlation between a worker’s skill supply and their <b>wage</b> <b>earnings.</b> The more skilled the worker and the better they are at their job, the more they will get paid. There is also a correlation between skill and education, suggesting that the more educated a worker is, the more skilled they will be. Therefore, there will be wage gaps between racial groups because of the differences in education and therefore, skill.|$|E
50|$|According to the Congressional Budget Office, the real, or inflation-adjusted, after-tax {{earnings}} {{of the wealthiest}} one percent of Americans grew by 275% from 1979 to 2007. Simultaneously, the real, after-tax {{earnings of}} the bottom twenty percent of <b>wage</b> <b>earnings</b> in the United States grew 18%. The difference {{in the growth of}} real income of the top 1% and the bottom 20% of Americans was 257%. The average increase in real, after-tax income for all U.S. households during this time period was 62% which is slightly below the real, after-tax income growth rate of 65% experienced by the top 20% of wage earners, not accounting for the top 1%. Data aggregated and analyzed by Robert B. Reich, Thomas Piketty, and Emmanuel Saez and released in a New York Times article written by Bill Marsh shows that real wages for production and non-supervisory workers, which account for 82% of the U.S. workforce, increased by 100% from 1947 to 1979 but then increased by only 8% from 1979-2009. Their data also shows that the bottom fifth experienced a 122% growth rate in wages from 1947 to 1979 but then experienced a negative growth rate of 4% in their real wages from 1979-2009. The real wages of the top fifth rose by 99% and then 55% during the same periods, respectively. Average real hourly wages have also increased by a significantly larger rate for the top 20% than they have for the bottom 20%. Real family income for the bottom 20% increased by 7.4% from 1979 to 2009 while it increased by 49% for the top 20% and increased by 22.7% for the second top fifth of American families. As of 2007, the United Nations estimated the ratio of average income for the top 10% to the bottom 10% of Americans, via the Gini Coefficient, as 15.9:1. The ratio of average income for the top 20% to the bottom 20% in the same year and using the same index was 8.4:1. According to these UN statistics, the United States has the third highest disparity between the average income of the top 10% and 20% to the bottom 10% and bottom 20% of the population, respectively, of the OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries. Only Chile and Mexico have larger average income disparities between the top 10% and bottom 10% of the population with 26:1 and 23:1, respectively. Consequently, the United States has the fourth highest Gini Coefficient of the OECD countries at 40.8% which is lower than Chile's (52%), Mexico's (51%), and just lower than Turkey's (42%).|$|E
