Following harvesting and site preparation, when residues were formed into <b>windrows,</b> in situ N mineralisation was measured in positions along the three tree-planting rows formed between the <b>windrows.</b> The position above the <b>windrow</b> had a higher nitrification rate than the other positions, averaging about 18 kg N ha- 1 /month compared with 12 and 9 Kg N ha- 1 for the positions between and below the <b>windrow</b> positions, respectively. This position also had consistently greater soil moisture. Macroplots were formed extending 5 m above and 10 m below a <b>windrow.</b> <b>Windrowed</b> residues within the macroplots were replaced by 15 N-labelled material comprising hoop pine foliage, branch and stem.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out {{at the request of}} the Swedish forest company Sveaskog which is an {{important}} producer of logging residues (branches and tops) intended for energy production. The company wanted to increase the average dry content to 60 percent in their delivered logging residues. At the time when this study was initiated, the dry content in the chipped logging residues originating from the Bergslagen district was at 52 percent. The aim of the study was to find out how <b>windrows</b> of logging residues could be arranged in order to help obtain desired properties such as increased dry content. Sveaskog had developed a system for evaluation of <b>windrows</b> and a standardized form was utilized to describe different properties of the <b>windrows.</b> The form consisted of six major sections, each looking at different quality parameters. Emphasis was directed towards evaluating the planning, preparation, and choice of site for the landing area and to see if local site conditions had been utilized to help improve the final <b>windrow</b> properties. Additional information concerning overall design of the <b>windrow</b> and the quality of the covering, as well as the extent of contamination in the <b>windrows</b> was also collected. There was no coherence between the six quality parameters investigated and the measured dry content. Furthermore, the number of months during which the logging residue had been stored in a <b>windrow</b> was found to be of negligible importance. On the contrary however, the time of the year during which the material was transported out of the stand appeared to affect measured dry content the most. Hauling in the period of April to October resulted in a higher dry content compared to the period between November and March. There were large differences between the dry content of <b>windrows</b> at the same sites which added to the sources of error in this study. In addition, it was impossible to accurately estimate the degree of contamination inside the <b>windrows</b> because of the amount of snow present during the time when the field work was conducted. Another problem in this study was that no data on dry content for individual <b>windrows</b> could be obtained; only averages for the entire site were available. This made it impossible to evaluate effects due to factors such as location of individual <b>windrows</b> and distance from <b>windrows</b> to the nearest standing forest, since most sites consisted of many different <b>windrows.</b> When performing a new similar study it would therefore be more appropriate to measure dry content on every single <b>windrow</b> instead of only obtaining overall averages.

50|$|In a 2007 {{study in}} Portugal, {{scientists}} suggested {{control of the}} fungus on oil palms would benefit from further consideration of the process as one of white rot. Ganoderma is an extraordinary organism capable exclusively of degrading lignin to carbon dioxide and water; celluloses are then available as nutrients for the fungus. It is necessary to consider this mode of attack as a white rot involving lignin biodegradation, for integrated control. The existing literature does not report this area {{and appears to be}} concerned particularly with the mode of spread and molecular biology of Ganoderma. The white rot perception opens up new fields in breeding/selecting for resistant cultivars of oil palms with high lignin content, ensuring the conditions for lignin decomposition are reduced, and simply sealing damaged oil palms to stop decay. The spread likely is by spores rather than roots. The knowledge gained can be employed in the rapid degradation of oil palm waste on the plantation floor by inoculating suitable fungi, and/or treating the waste more appropriately (e.g. chipping and spreading over the floor rather than <b>windrowing).</b>|$|E

5000|$|Compost <b>windrow</b> turners were {{developed}} to produce compost {{on a large scale}} by Fletcher Sims Jr. of Canyon, Texas [...] They are traditionally a large machine that straddles a <b>windrow</b> of 4 feet (1.25 meters) or more high, by as much as 12 feet (3.5 meters) across. Although smaller machines exist for small <b>windrows,</b> most operations use large machines for volume production. Turners drive through the <b>windrow</b> at a slow rate of forward movement. They have a steel drum with paddles that are rapidly turning. As the turner moves through the <b>windrow,</b> fresh air (oxygen) is injected into the compost by the drum/paddle assembly, and waste gases produced by bacterial decomposition are vented. The oxygen feeds the aerobic bacteria and thus speeds the composting process.|$|R
40|$|Background, Aims and Scope. Harvest {{residues}} {{were formed}} into <b>windrows</b> to prevent nitrogen (N) losses through volatilisation and erosion that occurred following pile and burn operations in hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii Aiton ex A. Cunn.) plantations of subtropical Australia. We selected second rotation (2 R) hoop pine sites where the <b>windrows</b> (10 - 15 m apart) had been formed 1, 2 and 3 {{years prior to}} sampling {{in order to examine}} soil carbon (C) and N in the areas beneath and between the <b>windrows.</b> Methods. We used conventional chemical methods, anaerobic incubation assay, 13 C and 15 N natural abundance analyses and, solid-state 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Results. Percent mineralisable N (PCMN) was the only parameter in the underneath <b>windrow</b> position at the Year 1 site that did not show a significant difference {{to the rest of the}} positions along the transect. However, positions adjacent to <b>windrows</b> did have significantly greater PCMN at the Year 1 site than other positions along the transect. PCMN, total N and total C were significantly greater underneath the <b>windrows</b> at the Year 3 site, whilst d 13 C was significantly more negative in the underneath <b>windrow</b> positions. Discussion. PCMN was the most sensitive biological indicator of the changes occurring in the soil due to decomposition of the <b>windrows,</b> with the beneath-windrow position having a significantly higher PCMN than the inter-windrow position (p< 0. 001) at the Year 3 site. Isotopic natural abundance for both 13 C and 15 N was able to detect the influx of labile materials from new residues. Solid-state 13 C NMR was able to detect inputs of labile C from the <b>windrows</b> at the Year 1 site, whilst the increase in aromatic C at the Year 3 site was indicative of the more advanced stages of <b>windrow</b> decomposition. Conclusions. Decomposition of <b>windrowed</b> residues had a beneficial effect on soil N and C pools. However, the effect remained localised after 3 years, indicating that trees needed to be planted close to the <b>windrows</b> to gain any benefit from residue decomposition. Recommendations and Perspectives. The use of <b>windrows</b> allows a clear planting area and provides a good barrier against soil erosion. However, trees can only gain access to the nutrients from the decomposing residues if they are planted close to the <b>windrows.</b> Limiting the width of the cleared areas to allow for only 2 planting rows will give the maximum benefit to the developing trees.

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to obtain information}} {{on the quality of}} grass seed when windrowed at the high moisture levels necessary for obtaining maximum yields. A secondary goal was to monitor moisture and temperature fluctuations in the windrow and to relate their effects to development and deterioration of the seed. Three species of perennial grasses were included in the study: tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) variety "Fawn", orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) variety "Potomac", and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) variety "Linn". The effect of heading date on seed development at the recommended <b>windrowing</b> time was evaluated with individually tagged panicles. Tall fescue was windrowed on 28 June, 01 July and 06 July; orchardgrass on 28 June, 01 July and 06 July; and perennial ryegrass on 01 July, 06 July and 16 July. These dates were chosen to provide windrows mowed at moisture levels higher than, equal to, and lower than the optimum for maximum yields of pure live seed. Moisture and temperature fluctuations in the windrow were monitored and changes in seed development and deterioration were evaluated. Heading date influenced several seed quality characteristics at the recommended time for <b>windrowing.</b> Early inflorescences were lowest in seed moisture content. Tall fescue and perennial ryegrass seeds from the Late group, and orchardgrass seeds from the Intermediate and Late groups had not attained maximum seed weight. Seedlings of tall fescue and orchardgrass produced by seeds from the Late group had not attained maximum shoot weight. Seeds of all inflorescence age groups reached maximum viability several days before optimum <b>windrowing</b> date. Seed moisture contents when windrowed were 51. 6, 41. 5, and 15. 9 % in tall fescue, 44. 8, 41. 4 and 30. 7 % in orchardgrass, and 49. 8, 28. 5 and 19. 1 % in perennial ryegrass. During periods without rainfall, seed moisture decreased rapidly during the day, increased during the night, and decreased to a new low the following day. Several rains occurred during this period, raising seed moisture levels above 40 %. During the drying period, seed moisture in {{the lower part of the}} perrenial ryegrass windrow was as much as 8 % higher than seed in the upper part. The average maximum temperatures in the upper and lower portions of the perennial ryegrass windrow were 38. 3 and 24. 3 Â°C during July and 31. 1 and 19. 2 â°C during August. The maximum temperature reached in the upper part was 47 Â°C on 28 and 29 July. Each weeks' delay in <b>windrowing</b> resulted in improved seed quality, with the greatest improvement occurring between the first and second cutting, However, the data support Klein and Harmond's recommendations for <b>windrowing</b> tall fescue at 43 % moisture, orchardgrass at 44 % moisture, and perennial ryegrass at 35 % moisture. Perennial ryegrass seed quality was not improved by delaying <b>windrowing,</b> while orchardgrass and tall fescue seeds increased somewhat in weight. Because of the risk of increased shattering losses, delaying <b>windrowing</b> to improve seed quality does not appear justified. A small amount of seed development took place while the seeds were in the windrow. Seed weight of tall fescue harvested at 51. 6 % moisture increased from 250. 6 to 279. 6 mg/ 100 seeds. No increase in seed weight occurred in the other species or <b>windrowing</b> dates. After several days in the windrow, speed of germination increased in all three species. Germination percentage, seedling emergence, and shoot weight did not improve after <b>windrowing.</b> Very little seed deterioration occurred during the first month in the windrow. A perceptible drop in germination of orchardgrass and perennial ryegrass occurred during the 2 weeks prior to the 19 August sampling date. Seed weight declined by the end of the experimental period in all three crops. Some germinated seeds were found in the perennial ryegras windrows by the end of August. No reduction in speed of germination or shoot weight occurred, while there was a trend toward reduced seedling emergence near the end of the experimental period. There were no indications that the stage of maturity when harvested influenced the rate of seed deterioration in the windrow. The probability of seed deterioration occurring at a faster rate than in 1976 is not great since a total of 75. 69 mm (2. 98 in) of rain fell during the experimental period, compared to a normal rainfall of 27. 43 mm (1. 08 in) ...|$|E

This was particularly true of the inverted <b>windrow.</b> The proportion of shells and seed infested with a microorganism was reduced 13 % and 36 %, respectively, after field drying for 5 to 7 days in random and inverted <b>windrows.</b> Microorganisms were isolated much more frequently from shell pieces (73 %) than from seed (36 %) ...|$|R
25|$|There are {{two main}} methods of {{large-scale}} vermiculture. Some systems use a <b>windrow,</b> which consists of bedding materials for the earthworms to live in and acts as a large bin; organic material is added to it. Although the <b>windrow</b> has no physical barriers to prevent worms from escaping, in theory they should not due to an abundance of organic matter for them to feed on. Often <b>windrows</b> are used on a concrete surface to prevent predators from gaining access to the worm population.|$|R
40|$|Cotton is an {{important}} crop in Greece, covering more than 255, 000 ha every year. Apart from the lint and seed, cotton produces large amounts of residues {{that can be used}} for energy production. The aim of this work was to study the performance of the machinery used for harvesting cotton residues. Conventional hay harvesting machinery was used for harvesting cotton residues in Central Greece. A mower, a rake and a baler were used for cutting, <b>windrowing</b> and baling cotton stalks, respectively. Data were collected from 41 fields. The performance of the farm machinery was recorded using low cost Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers, which also acted as data loggers, placed on each tractor. Data analysis was performed using the MATLAB (R) technical programming language. The effective time and the field capacity were estimated for each operation. The effective time was 69 % for cutting, 68 % for <b>windrowing</b> and 60 % for baling. The measured average field capacities were 2. 64 ha h(- 1) (3. 38 t h(- 1)), 2. 1 ha h(- 1) (2. 76 t h(- 1)), and 3. 71 ha h(- 1) (4. 47 t h(- 1)), for the cutting, <b>windrowing,</b> and baling operations, respectively. These results are considerably different from the corresponding estimations for hay handling operations using existing available databases and software tools. This deviation reveals that average norms for the prediction of machinery performance during hay handling cannot be used for the scheduling of handling operations for cotton residues within the bioenergy production supply chain.

Harvesting dry edible beans in Nebraska normally includes three separate field operations [...] cutting, rodding or <b>windrowing,</b> and combining [...] {{over a period of}} three to seven days. The success of these operations is very dependent on equipment selection and adjustment, weather and field conditions, and operator skill...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-Windrowing site preparation, the raking and piling of long rows {{of logging}} debris, has been {{reported}} to displace surface soil, redistribute nutrients, and reduce volume growth of southern pine forests. Many of these studies have reported short-term results, and there are few long-term studies of the effects of <b>windrowing</b> on soil properties and pine growth. A 16. 2 hectare tract on Sacul fine sandy loam (clayey, mixed, thermic Aquic Hapludult) in Jackson Parish in northern Louisiana was windrowed in 1975. The objective {{of this study is to}} compare soil physical and chemical properties from scraped areas between windrows with that from windrow pile soils, 25 years after <b>windrowing.</b> Surface, subsurface, and subsoil horizons were sampled from 13 soil profiles within inter-row (scraped) and windrow (piled) positions. Thickness of the 0, A, and E horizons, as well as depth to the Bt horizon, were measured in these profiles. Comparisons were made on the following properties for each horizon on each of the two site positions: organic matter, pH, available phosphorus, and exchangeable calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium. Bulk density was measured for windrow and inter-row position surface and subsurface soils. Pore space and air-filled volume were calculated using bulk density and water content...|$|E
