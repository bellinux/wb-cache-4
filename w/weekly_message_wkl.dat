40|$|OBJECTIVE: Two {{types of}} social norm message frame for {{encouraging}} seeking of alcohol-related health information by excessive drinkers were compared: (a) {{how much the}} average person actually drinks and (b) how their drinking ranks among others. It was hypothesized, in accordance with recent evidence of how the brain represents value, that Frame (b) {{would be more effective}} than Frame (a). This is the first test comparing these frames in any domain of social norms research. METHOD: U. K. university students with excessive alcohol intake (n = 101; 66 female) were sent 4 <b>weekly</b> <b>messages</b> containing 1 of 4 types of information depending upon the experimental condition to which each participant was randomly allocated: (a) official alcohol consumption guidelines, (b) how their alcohol consumption compared with official guidelines, (c) how their consumption compared with the sample mean, or (d) how their consumption ranked among the sample. They then had the opportunity to request up to 3 types of alcohol-related health information. RESULTS: Participants informed of how their consumption ranked were more likely to request information (p <. 01, odds ratio = 6. 0) and tended to request a greater number of types of information (p <. 01, Wald = 7. 17) than those in other conditions.

Ninety-one city employees (52 male and 39 female) of a medium-sized Midwestern city in the United States participated in the study. Participants were divided into four groups according to desire to receive wellness email messages and amount of information provided in the message.
