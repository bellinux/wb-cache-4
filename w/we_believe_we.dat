2500|$|Following {{the crash}} of the second prototype, a company {{spokesman}} stated that all the details about the program's future were under review by the company. On 25 March 2009 Cessna CEO Jack Pelton confirmed that the 162 program would continue, saying: [...] "The need for a modern, cost-effective two-seat trainer aircraft has never been greater, and <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> are well positioned to meet that need. The Skycatcher program {{is an important part of}} our strategy." ...|$|E

2500|$|In her 1988 book, Lesbian Ethics: Toward New Value, lesbian philosopher Sarah Lucia Hoagland {{alludes to}} lesbian separatism's {{potential}} to encourage lesbians to develop healthy community ethics based on shared values. [...] Hoagland articulates a distinction (originally noted by lesbian separatist author and anthologist, Julia Penelope) between a lesbian subculture and a lesbian community; {{membership in the}} subculture being [...] "defined in negative terms by an external, hostile culture", and membership in the community being based on [...] "the values <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> can enact here".|$|E
2500|$|On September 8, 2011, {{a trailer}} with {{real-time}} in-game footage {{was released on}} Crytek's Twitter page. It showed brand new features for consoles including all new lighting, new effects and new Nanosuit controls, fine-tuned combat and full stereoscopic 3D support. This version is download-only. [...] "We are extremely proud {{of what we were}} able to accomplish with Crysis," [...] said Crytek CEO Cevat Yerli. [...] "We set out to create a next-generation FPS and delivered a PC experience that became a benchmark for quality- and still is for many gamers even four years later. [...] "By bringing the single-player campaign to console, <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> are again setting a new standard for quality in downloadable gaming," [...] he added. However, unlike the original, the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the game lack the online multiplayer component as well as the second to last Campaign mission titled [...] "Ascension". Also, neither Warhead nor Wars expansions are included. It was released on October 4, 2011.|$|E

60|$|Then I {{forced myself}} {{to take part in}} conversation, {{speaking}} of this or that trouble or adventure in the past; but never once of what might be before us in the future, and thus the time passed until <b>we</b> <b>believed</b> <b>we</b> were warranted in setting forth.|$|R

"We {{have heard}} the story," [...] {{answered}} the old man (which indeed they had with many additions), [...] "and <b>we</b> <b>believe.</b> <b>We</b> believe that the Heavens above gave thee their own name which {{is the name of}} the Spirit of our people.

5000|$|We {{have endured}} prison, zuchthaus and {{concentration}} camps because <b>we</b> <b>believed</b> <b>we</b> must {{work for the}} thoughts and goals of socialism and {{for the preservation of}} peace, even under the [...] dictatorship. In zuchthaus and concentration camp, despite the daily threat of a wretched death, we continued our conspiratorial activities.|$|R
6000|$|... "His master (<b>we</b> <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> may mention, without {{offending}} delicacy, {{the well-known}} name of Sir George Flimsy, {{of the house}} of Flimsy, Diddler, and Flash,) smilingly asked Mr. James what was the amount of his savings, wondering considerably how, out of an income of thirty guineas--the main part of which he spent in bouquets, silk stockings, and perfumery--Mr. Plush could have managed to lay by anything.|$|E
6000|$|In fact, a {{sympathetic}} silence possessed the whole company. It was broken at last by the closest listener's saying: [...] "After all, I don't know that Metchnikoff's book is so very blighting. It's certainly {{a very important}} book, and it produces a reaction which may be wholesome or unwholesome as you choose to think. And no matter what <b>we</b> <b>believe,</b> <b>we</b> must respect the honesty of the scientific attitude in regard to a matter that has been too much abandoned to the emotions, perhaps. In all seriousness I wish some scientific man would apply the scientific method to finding out the soul, as you"--he turned to the light skirmisher--"suggest. Why shouldn't it be investigated?" ...|$|E
60|$|Owing to my absence, yours of the 22nd ult. was not {{received}} till this moment. Judge Logan and myself {{are willing to}} attend to any business in the Supreme Court you may send us. As to fees, {{it is impossible to}} establish a rule that will apply in all, or even a great many cases. <b>We</b> <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> are never accused of being very unreasonable in this particular; and we would always be easily satisfied, provided we could see the money--but whatever fees we earn at a distance, if not paid before, we have noticed, we never hear of after the work is done. We, therefore, are growing a little sensitive on that point.|$|E

60|$|We are {{the creatures}} of a perverse social selection. We meet force with force. Only the strong shall endure. We {{believe in the}} {{survival}} of the fittest. You have crushed your wage slaves into the dirt and you have survived. The captains of war, at your command, have shot down like dogs your employees in a score of bloody strikes. By such means you have endured. We do not grumble at the result, for we acknowledge and have our being in the same natural law. And now the question has arisen: UNDER THE PRESENT SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT, WHICH OF US SHALL SURVIVE? <b>We</b> <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> are the fittest. You believe you are the fittest. We leave the eventuality to time and law.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> may {{venture to}} assume that at no period during the {{movements}} of 1834-5 did Sir Robert Peel ever believe {{in the success of}} his administration. Its mere failure could occasion him little dissatisfaction; he was compensated for it by the noble opportunity afforded to him for the display of those great qualities, both moral and intellectual, which the swaddling-clothes of a routine prosperity had long repressed, but of which his opposition to the Reform Bill had given to the nation a significant intimation. The brief administration elevated him in public opinion, and even in the eye of Europe; and it is probable that a much longer term of power would not have contributed more to his fame.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. You mustn't imagine I've {{tackled the}} problem this very morning; I've been {{considering}} {{it for some}} time, and I've talked and consulted with Alora and Irene and Laura and the other girls about {{the best way to}} redeem the situation. We knew the situation was desperate long before last night's meeting. So all our plans are made, and <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> can sell all the bonds required. It was our policy to keep silent until we knew what the big mass-meeting last night would accomplish, but we suspected it would turn out just the way it did--a fizzle. So the job's up to us, and if you'll sit quiet, Gran'pa Jim, and let us girls do the work, we'll put Dorfield in the honor column by Saturday night." ...|$|E

6000|$|Hebblethwaite sighed resignedly. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "the {{question}} you submit {{is a problem}} which has presented itself to us once or twice, although I may {{tell you that there}} isn't a soul in the Cabinet except one who believes in the chance of war. We are not a fire-eating lot, you know. We are all for peace, and <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> are going to have it. However, to answer your questions more closely, our obligations depend entirely upon the provocation giving cause for the war. If France and Russia provoked it in any way, we should remain neutral. If it were a war of sheer aggression from Germany against France, we might to a certain extent intervene. There is not one of us, however, who believes for a single moment that Germany would enter upon such a war." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> {{have now}} shown {{that there is}} a {{tendency}} in nature to the continued progression of certain classes of varieties further and further from the original type--a progression to which there appears no reason to assign any definite limits--and that the same principle which produces this result in a state of nature will also explain why domestic varieties have a tendency, when they become wild, to revert to the original type. This progression, by minute steps, in various directions, but always checked and balanced by the necessary conditions, subject to which alone existence can be preserved, may, it is believed, be followed out so as to agree with all the phÃ¦nomena presented by organized beings, their extinction and succession in past ages, and all the extraordinary modifications of form, instinct and habits which they exhibit.|$|E

The {{first week}} we lost twenty a day {{shot in the}} houses; but now that we have, as far as possible, blocked every {{loophole}} at which a bullet can enter, we are not losing so many as at first, but the daily total is still heavy, and {{on a day like}} the 20th we lost thirty. The enemy attacked us all round, and we mowed them down with grape; <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> killed over a thousand of them. Unfortunately, every day our losses are getting heavier from disease, foul air, and overcrowding; the women and children suffer awfully. If you are disposed to make yourselves useful when not on duty, you will find abundant opportunity for kindness among them. I will take you round the house and introduce you to the ladies, then you can go among them as you like." ...|$|E
