25|$|Murakami is {{a serious}} {{marathon}} runner and triathlon enthusiast, {{though he did not}} start running until he was 33 years old. On 23 June 1996, he completed his first ultramarathon, a 100km race around Lake Saroma in Hokkaido, Japan. He discusses his relationship with running in his 2008 memoir What I Talk About <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>Talk</b> <b>About</b> Running.|$|E
25|$|After {{receiving}} the Gunzo Award for his 1979 literary work Hear the Wind Sing, Murakami did not aspire {{to meet other}} writers. Aside from Sarah Lawrence's Mary Morris, whom he briefly mentions in his memoir What I Talk About <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>Talk</b> <b>About</b> Running alongside Joyce Carol Oates and Toni Morrison, Murakami was never {{a part of a}} community of writers, his reason being that he was a loner and was never fond of groups, schools, and literary circles. When working on a book, Murakami states that he relies on his wife, who is always his first reader. While he never acquainted himself with many writers, Murakami enjoys the works of Ryu Murakami and Banana Yoshimoto.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Murakami {{published}} the anthology Birthday Stories, which collects short {{stories on the}} theme of birthdays. The collection includes work by Russell Banks, Ethan Canin, Raymond Carver, David Foster Wallace, Denis Johnson, Claire Keegan, Andrea Lee, Daniel Lyons, Lynda Sexson, Paul Theroux, and William Trevor, as well as a story by Murakami himself. What I Talk About <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>Talk</b> <b>About</b> Running, containing tales about his experience as a marathon runner and a triathlete, was published in Japan in 2007, with English translations released in the U.K. and the U.S. in 2008. The title is a play on that of Raymond Carver's short story collection, What We Talk About When We Talk About Love.|$|E

He has also used cinéma-vérité techniques (such as hand-held camera work) to convey realism. In an interview at the Film Society of Lincoln Center, he explained his emphasis on realism in The Dark Knight trilogy: [...] "You try and get the audience to invest in cinematic reality. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> reality in these films, it's often misconstrued as a direct reality, but it's really about a cinematic reality." ...|$|E

In an {{interview}} with Third Way Magazine Williams responded: [...] "I am genuinely a lot more conservative than he would like me to be. Take the Resurrection. I think he has said that of course I know what all the reputable scholars think on the subject and therefore <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the risen body I must mean something other than the empty tomb. But I don't. I don't know how to persuade him, but I really don't." ...|$|E

Once <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> climbing above the crowd, you said perhaps {{one need not}} climb. One ought to stop at one's proper level, {{and try to make}} things better. Well, when the Spaniards offered me a good post, I remembered. I'd had enough of shabby ambitions and knew my level. In fact, so to speak, the light was breaking." ...|$|R

(Roger was an accomplished 2-D artist whose drawings and painting of horses and other wildlife showed a detailed understanding of musculature and anatomy.) But he also argued that Patterson had [...] "nowhere near the knowledge or facilities to do so—nor for that matter, did anyone else ... <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> {{some of the more}} technical details of biomechanics, he (Patterson) showed the familiar blank look of a student who had lost the drift of the explanation, but was still trying hard to pay attention. Yet he must have known all these details to create a hoax. For instance, he could see the anterior position of the front of the shin, but how that related to foot leverage was quite beyond him." ...|$|R

60|$|In {{this chapter}} I hope {{to point out}} how a {{misunderstanding}} of this kind affects the common impression, not altogether unfounded, that the Americans talk about dollars. But for the moment I am merely anxious to avoid a similar misunderstanding <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> Americans. About the dogmas of democracy, about {{the right of a}} people to its own symbols, whether they be coins or customs, I am convinced, and no longer to be shaken. But about the meaning of those symbols, in silver or other substances, I am always open to correction. That error is the price we pay for the great glory of nationality. And in this sense I am quite ready, at the start, to warn my own readers against my own opinions.|$|E
60|$|Lest any man think I {{mean to be}} ill-natured <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> our pilgrims as I {{have been}} talking, I wish to say in all sincerity that I do not. I would not listen to lectures from men I did not like and could not respect; and none of these can say I ever took their lectures unkindly, or was restive under the infliction, or failed to try to profit by what they said to me. They are better men than I am; I can say that honestly; they are good friends of mine, too--and besides, {{if they did not}} wish to be stirred up {{occasionally}} in print, why in the mischief did they travel with me? They knew me. They knew my liberal way--that I like to give and take--when it is for me to give and other people to take. When one of them threatened to leave me in Damascus when I had the cholera, he had no real idea of doing it--I know his passionate nature and the good impulses that underlie it. And did I not overhear Church, another pilgrim, say he did not care who went or who staid, he would stand by me till I walked out of Damascus on my own feet or was carried out in a coffin, if it was a year? And do I not include Church every time I abuse the pilgrims--and would I be likely to speak ill-naturedly of him? I wish to stir them up and make them healthy; that is all.|$|E

500|$|I think I should {{rephrase}} {{myself from}} my previous letters <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> taking a 'break'.

The things I've been doing for work lately have been so much fun, because it's not like work to me anymore. I've been even more 'hands on' in my management and the business side of things, and I feel more in control than ever.|$|R
50|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> {{hear you}} <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> {{a lot of}} new names, it’s not always {{possible}} for me to understand when I’ve seen absolutely nothing by them.

6000|$|... [Added {{the next}} morning.]--He who indulges habitually in the intoxicating {{pleasure}}s of imagination, {{for the very}} reason that he reaps a greater pleasure than others, must resign himself to a keener pain, a more intolerable and utter prostration. It is quite possible, and even comparatively easy, so to enfold oneself in pleasant fancies that the realities of life may seem but as the white snow-shower in the street, that only gives a relish to the swept hearth and lively fire within. By such means I have forgotten hunger, I have sometimes eased pain, and I have invariably changed into the most pleasant {{hours of the day}} those very vacant and idle seasons which would otherwise have hung most heavily upon my hand. But all this is attained by the undue prominence of purely imaginative joys, and consequently the weakening and almost the destruction of reality. This is buying at too great a price. There are seasons when the imagination becomes somehow tranced and surfeited, as it is with me this morning; and then upon what can we fall back? The very faculty that we have fostered and trusted has failed us in the hour of trial; and we have so blunted and enfeebled our appetite for the others that they are subjectively dead to us. It is just as though a farmer should plant all his fields in potatoes, instead of varying them with grain and pasture; and so, when the disease comes, lose all his harvest, while his neighbours, perhaps, may balance the profit and the loss. Do not suppose that I am exaggerating <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> all pleasures seeming stale. To me, at least, the edge of almost everything is put on by imagination; and even nature, in these days when the fancy is drugged and useless, wants half the charm it has in better moments. I can no longer see satyrs in the thicket, or picture a highwayman riding down the lane. The fiat of indifference has gone forth: I am vacant, unprofitable: a leaf on a river with no volition and no aim: a mental drunkard the morning after an intellectual debauch. Yes, I have a more subtle opium in my own mind than any apothecary's drug; but it has a sting of its own, and leaves me as flat and helpless as does the other.|$|E
6000|$|She {{had never}} uttered her worst thought {{to her husband}} before, and the {{sensation}} of hearing it was evidently new to Osmond. But he showed no surprise, and his coolness was apparently a proof that he had believed his wife would in fact be unable to resist for ever his ingenious endeavour to draw her out. [...] "It's all the more intense then," [...] he answered. And he added {{almost as if he}} were giving her a friendly counsel: [...] "This is a very important matter." [...] She recognised that; she was fully conscious of the weight of the occasion; she knew that between them they had arrived at a crisis. Its gravity made her careful; she said nothing, and he went on. [...] "You say I've no reason? I have the very best. I dislike, {{from the bottom of my}} soul, what you intend to do. It's dishonourable; it's indelicate; it's indecent. Your cousin is nothing whatever to me, and I'm under no obligation to make concessions to him. I've already made the very handsomest. Your relations with him, while he was here, kept me on pins and needles; but I let that pass, because from week to week I expected him to go. I've never liked him and he has never liked me. That's why you like him--because he hates me," [...] said Osmond with a quick, barely audible tremor in his voice. [...] "I've an ideal of what my wife should do and should not do. She should not travel across Europe alone, in defiance of my deepest desire, to sit at the bedside of other men. Your cousin's nothing to you; he's nothing to us. You smile most expressively <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> US, but I assure you that WE, WE, Mrs. Osmond, is all I know. I take our marriage seriously; you appear to have found a way of not doing so. I'm not aware that we're divorced or separated; for me we're indissolubly united. You are nearer to me than any human creature, and I'm nearer to you. It may be a disagreeable proximity; it's one, at any rate, of our own deliberate making. You don't like to be reminded of that, I know; but I'm perfectly willing, because--because--" [...] And he paused a moment, looking as if he had something to say which would be very much to the point. [...] "Because I think we should accept the consequences of our actions, and what I value most in life is the honour of a thing!" ...|$|E
