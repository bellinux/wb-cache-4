5|$|In December 1999, a {{disagreement}} arose between the Ministry of Transport and Communications and the city; {{the city would}} not except the government's promise to finance part of the line. Both Minister of Transport and Communications, Dag Jostein Fjærvoll from the Christian Democratic Party and Oslo City Commissioner of Transport and the Environment, Merete Agerbak-Jensen from the Conservative Party, agreed upon the distribution of funding {{from the city and}} state, and both wanted construction to start as soon as possible. The city council did not accept the guarantees from the state until March 2000. Construction started in June, with the Agency for Road and Transport of the municipality responsible for construction.

5|$|In May 1941, {{following}} {{the construction of}} the central north–south Stuart Highway, the federal government announced its decision to build the east–west highway between Norseman and Port Augusta. A northerly route, close to the Trans-Australian Railway, had been considered, but extensive limestone outcrops made it impractical. Taking a route east from Norseman, with some detours around limestone ridges, would allow a road to be formed quickly and easily. With a war in the Pacific seemingly imminent, construction soon began, in July 1941. The Army was responsible for fuel, food, and communications, <b>while</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> government departments of Main Roads (Western Australia) and Highways (South Australia) managed the actual construction.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of the Supreme Court, {{business}} was conducted at a variety of locations in downtown Salem. The first public building to house the court was the Territorial Capitol Building in Salem that was built between 1854 and 1855. In that building the courtroom was in a chamber measuring 20 feet by 27 feet on the first floor. On December 29, 1855, after the building was partially occupied, it burned to the ground. In 1876, the state finished construction on a second capitol building where the court was located on the third floor. This courtroom measured 54 feet by 46 feet, <b>while</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> law library was 75 feet by 70 feet. A separate building was built by the state in 1914 to house the Supreme Court, and this is now the oldest building on the Capitol Mall after the second capitol building burned down on April 25, 1935.|$|E

5|$|Buckingham Palace finally {{became the}} {{principal}} royal residence in 1837, on the accession of Queen Victoria, {{who was the}} first monarch to reside there; her predecessor WilliamIV had died before its completion. <b>While</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> rooms were a riot of gilt and colour, the necessities of the new palace were somewhat less luxurious. For one thing, it was reported the chimneys smoked so much that the fires had to be allowed to die down, and consequently the court shivered in icy magnificence. Ventilation was so bad that the interior smelled, and when it was decided to install gas lamps, there was a serious worry about the build-up of gas on the lower floors. It was also said that staff were lax and lazy and the palace was dirty. Following the Queen's marriage in 1840, her husband, Prince Albert, concerned himself with a reorganisation of the household offices and staff, and with the design faults of the palace. The problems were all rectified by the close of 1840. However, the builders were to return within the decade.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Imperial Japan {{attacked}} Indochina and wrested {{control from}} France, {{but when they}} were defeated by the Allies in 1945, a power vacuum resulted. The communist-dominated Vietminh of Ho Chi Minh fought for Vietnamese independence, while the French attempted {{to regain control of}} their colony by creating the French Union-allied State of Vietnam. Up until 1954, the First Indochina War raged. In 1954, the French lost the Battle of Dien Bien Phu and the Geneva Conference was held to determine the future of French Indochina. The Vietminh were given control of North Vietnam, <b>while</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> of Vietnam controlled the territory south of the 17th parallel. The Geneva agreements, which the State of Vietnam did not sign, called for reunification elections to be held in 1956.

Bảo Đại appointed Diệm as his Prime Minister, hoping Diệm would be able to attract American aid as the French withdrew from Southeast Asia. Diệm returned to Vietnam in June 1954 and took up the post on July 7, 1954. After a series of disagreements, Diệm deposed Bảo Đại in a fraudulent referendum on October 23, 1955, and declared himself president of the newly-proclaimed Republic of Vietnam three days later. Diệm received support from the US and other anti-communist countries {{in the midst of the}} Cold War. He refused to hold national reunification elections scheduled in 1956, and asserted that Ho would rig the ballots in the north, although he had done so himself in deposing Bảo Đại. In the meantime, Diệm continued to consolidate his rule and stabilize his new nation.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, the {{legality}} of DFS has been determined on a state-by-state basis based on local gambling laws and other rulings. The federal Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIEGA) contains language dictating that fantasy sports are not considered an unlawful wager under the act; however, the act only prohibits the electronic transfer of funds from unlawful gambling as defined under state laws. A number of state attorneys general have issued opinions concluding that DFS {{is a form of}} illegal gambling, <b>while</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> of Nevada declared that DFS games must be licensed as a sports pool. The New York State ruling, which resulted from an investigation of DFS services after it was alleged that employees working for DraftKings and FanDuel had used inside information to win cash prizes from each other, spawned retaliatory lawsuits from the companies which alleged that the rulings were the result of a misinterpretation of the nature of their services. The state has since joined other states, such as Massachusetts and Virginia, in choosing to legalize and regulate DFS rather than prohibit it.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of Isabel, Governor Ed Rendell {{declared}} a state of emergency for the state. The Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency activated a support team to assist Urban Search and Rescue operations as part of the threat from the storm. The state's National Guard placed 2,990guardsmen on Emergency Condition 5 status to be deployed anywhere in the state for emergency support, with other guardsmen readying equipment such as generators, heavy trucks, water trailers, and engineer equipment for deployment. State police officers were readied for deployment, <b>while</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> health department contacted hospitals to ensure generators were in working condition. The state Environmental Protection Agency prepared for the storm by monitoring the status of all dams, water treatment facilities, and nuclear plants. In addition, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission stationed extra workers to patrol the highways in poor drainage areas, with extra equipment prepared for quick response for potential road blockage.

5|$|The {{city and}} state then had to provide a location, {{and one of the}} {{promises}} the city made was to erect a fitting memorial to those who served in World War I. Thus, in January 1920 a public library, St. Clair Park, University Park, and two occupied city blocks were designated as the site for the plaza, with one new building for the American Legion to use as their national headquarters, various public buildings, and a war memorial. The Indiana War Memorial Bill was passed in July 1920 and appropriated $2 million for construction and land. Work began in 1921. The {{city and state}} reached an agreement whereby the city would pay for the site and maintenance costs, <b>while</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> of Indiana would pay for the memorial's construction.
