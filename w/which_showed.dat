5|$|Principal {{contributors}} {{to the development of}} a theoretical treatment of ionic crystal structures were Max Born, Fritz Haber, Alfred Landé, Erwin Madelung, Paul Peter Ewald, and Kazimierz Fajans. Born predicted crystal energies based on the assumption of ionic constituents, <b>which</b> <b>showed</b> good correspondence to thermochemical measurements, further supporting the assumption.|$|E

5|$|WMAR-TV {{conducted}} the only poll {{of the general}} election with SurveyUSA, <b>which</b> <b>showed</b> O'Malley leading with 87% of the vote. On Election Day, O'Malley easily defeated Tufaro in the general election, receiving over 90% of the vote.|$|E
5|$|A {{fluxgate}} gradiometer {{survey in}} July 2009 investigated standing stones {{in the garden}} of the Druids Arms public house known as The Cove, <b>which</b> <b>showed</b> that the stones date from nearly a thousand years before the stone circles. The conclusion from the study was that these upright stones are likely to have been the portals or façade of a chambered tomb.|$|E
5|$|At age 16 Mendelssohn {{wrote his}} String Octet in E-flat major, the first work <b>which</b> <b>showed</b> the full {{power of his}} genius. This Octet and his Overture to Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, which he wrote a year later in 1826, are the best-known of his early works. (Later, in 1842, he also wrote {{incidental}} music for the play, including the famous Wedding March.) The Overture is perhaps the earliest example of a concert overture– that is, a piece not written deliberately to accompany a staged performance, but to evoke a literary theme in performance on a concert platform; this was a genre which became a popular form in musical Romanticism.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{outbreak}} of World War II, he conducted experiments <b>which</b> <b>showed</b> that in the fission process, neutrons were emitted. In early 1939 he envisaged {{that a large number}} of fissions could occur and if this happened within a sufficiently short time, then considerable amounts of energy could be released. He went on to calculate that this process could occur in less than a microsecond, and as a consequence would result in an explosion.|$|E
5|$|By 1911, {{the owner}} Major Richard Winstanley {{was unable to}} pay for the upkeep of the castle and, {{concerned}} about its deteriorating condition, proposed placing the property into the guardianship of the Commissioners of Works. Following a survey by the architect Sir Frank Baines, <b>which</b> <b>showed</b> the ruins to need immediate repairs, the Commissioners took over the castle the following year. It was restored by Sir Charles Peers, the Inspector of Ancient Monuments, between 1912 and 1913. He stripped away any remains of the farm, cleared the vegetation from the walls and repaired the brickwork, re-cutting the moat and reconstructing a replica of the medieval bridge.|$|E
5|$|During {{her second}} year, Geiling was {{retained}} by the FDA to research unusual deaths related to elixir sulfanilamide, a sulfonamide medicine. Kelsey assisted on this research project, <b>which</b> <b>showed</b> that the 107 deaths {{were caused by}} the use of diethylene glycol as a solvent. The next year, the United States Congress passed the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938. That same year she completed her studies and received a Ph.D. in pharmacology at the University of Chicago. Working with Geiling led to her interest in teratogens, drugs that cause congenital malformations (birth defects).|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to PET and fMRI, <b>which</b> <b>show</b> <b>which</b> {{areas of the}} brain are activated by certain tasks, researchers also use diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), <b>which</b> <b>shows</b> the neural pathways that connect different brain areas, thus providing insight into how different areas interact. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is another hemodynamic method used in language tasks.|$|R

5|$|Early {{experiments}} with radiolabelled systemin in tomato demonstrated {{that it is}} transported through the phloem sap in tomato plants and was therefore {{thought to be the}} systemic signal that activated systemic acquired resistance. This view was challenged by grafting experiments <b>which</b> <b>showed</b> that mutants deficient in jasmonic acid biosynthesis and perception were unable to activate systemic acquired resistance. It is now thought that jasmonic acid is the systemic signal and that systemin upregulates the pathways for jasmonic acid synthesis.|$|E
5|$|Former Financial Times {{journalist}} Duff McDonald, said McKinsey's confidentiality policy often {{prevents the}} public from becoming informed about the firm's work, except after it is exposed through lawsuits or investigations. 13,000 McKinsey documents were released {{as part of a}} lawsuit against Allstate, <b>which</b> <b>showed</b> that McKinsey recommended the company reduce payouts to insurance claimants by offering low settlements, delaying processing to wear out claimants through attrition, and fighting customers that protest in court. Allstate's profits doubled over ten years after adopting McKinsey's strategy, but it also led to lawsuits alleging they were cheating claimants out of legitimate insurance claims.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are {{assigned}} to the case.

5|$|Hugh de Cressy (died 1189) was an Anglo-Norman {{administrator}} and nobleman. Little {{is known of}} his ancestry and he first served two brothers of King Henry II of England before becoming a royal official. He was rewarded with a marriage to an heiress for his service to the king. In England he often served as a royal justice and witnessed documents, <b>which</b> <b>showed</b> his closeness to the king. On the continent, he recruited mercenaries for the royal army and was named constable of the castle of Rouen in the royal lands in France. He died in 1189 after giving lands to various monasteries before his death.|$|E
5|$|In 1816 the RIAL was {{authorized}} to operate two new Royal Grammar Schools, in Quebec City and in Montreal. This {{was a turning point}} for public education in Lower Canada as the schools were created by legislation, the District Public Schools Act of 1807, <b>which</b> <b>showed</b> the government's willingness to support the costs of education and even the salary of a schoolmaster. This was an important first step in the creation of nondenominational schools. When James McGill died in 1813 his bequest was administered by the RIAL.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, the {{discovery}} of a 51 Pegasi-like planet orbiting 55 Cancri A was announced, together with the planet of Tau Boötis and the inner planet of Upsilon Andromedae. The planet was discovered by measuring the star's radial velocity, <b>which</b> <b>showed</b> a periodicity of around 14.7 days corresponding to a planet at least 78% of the mass of Jupiter. These radial velocity measurements still showed a drift unaccounted-for by this planet, which could be explained by the gravitational influence of a more distant object.|$|E
