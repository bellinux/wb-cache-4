5|$|In 'Nothing Really Matters' and 'The Power of Good-Bye', I {{want people}} to have a visceral and {{emotional}} reaction to things, rather than to have in their mind where all my stuff comes from. With the songs, I {{wanted to say that}} it does not matter really <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> or do, just think by yourself, and not judge and dissect others. You know if I see a bug crawling across the floor and it inspired me to write the most incredible love poem, I don't {{want people to}} be thinking about their relationship, and then think of my bug crawling across the floor. It's then that the power of good-bye becomes better than the power of acceptance.|$|E

Meyer says that the books are {{centered}} around Bella's choice to choose her life on her own, and the Cullens' choices to abstain from killing rather than follow their temptations: [...] "I really think that's the underlying metaphor of my vampires. It doesn't matter where you're stuck in life or <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> you have to do; you can always choose something else. There's always a different path." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{idea behind}} Mad Dogs {{came from the}} {{friendship}} between the four main actors, who wanted to work together for a television project, as well as Cris Cole and executive producer Suzanne Mackie. The four initially {{wanted to make a}} story about a rock band, but decided that making programmes about bands have been [...] "done to death".

While no exact release date was announced, Miyamoto stated that he hoped to release the game during 2011. The game was showcased at Nintendo's press conference at E3 2011, where a 2011 release date was confirmed, along with the appearance of the Tanooki Suit. While the power-up allows Mario to float down gently, unlike Super Mario Bros. 3 he cannot fly.|$|E

[...] "He's talking Silver all the time, and that's where we've got him", Hanna stated, pounding his desk, in July. [...] He proved correct; the silver enthusiasm waned by September and Bryan had no ready replacement for it. [...] McKinley, {{on the other}} hand, convinced that his [...] "sound money" [...] campaign had worked, began to promote his tariff issue, stating to the crowds on his front lawn, [...] "I do not know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about it, but I believe {{it is a good}} deal better to open the mills of the United States to the labor of America than to open the mints of the United States to the silver of the world." ...|$|E

[...] The lyrics puts Madonna in a more direct {{position}} expressing her sexual desires for her man according to author Santiago Fouz-Hernández in the line [...] "If you gave me half a chance you'd see; My desire burning inside of me." [...] According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] is written in the time signature of common time with a medium funk tempo of 112 beats per minute.

500|$|Amid this tension, Willkie and Roosevelt met for {{the first}} time, at the White House on December 13, 1934.

I DIDNT TELL HIM <b>WHAT</b> <b>YOU</b> <b>THINK</b> OF HIM" [...] Roosevelt decided that the utility holding companies had to be broken up, stated so in his 1935 State of the Union address and met with Willkie later in January to inform him of his intent. In the meantime, the companies did their best to sabotage the TVA; farmers were told by corporate representatives that lines from the new Norris Dam could not carry enough power to make a light bulb glow, and the company ran [...] "spite lines" [...] that might not even carry power in an effort to invoke the non-compete agreement over broad areas.|$|E

Cher embodies an unapologetic freedom and fearlessness that some of us can only aspire to." [...] Rolling Stone Jancee Dunn wrote, [...] "Cher is the coolest woman who ever stood in shoes. Why? Because her motto is, 'I don't give a shit <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> I'm going to wear this multicolored wig.' There are folks all over America who would, in their heart of hearts, love to date people half their age, get multiple tattoos and wear feathered headdresses. Cher does it for us." [...] Alexander Fury of The Independent wrote that Cher [...] "represents a seemingly immortal, omnipotent, uni-monikered level of fame." [...] Bego stated: [...] "No one in the history of show business has had a career of the magnitude and scope of Cher's. She has been a teenage pop star, a television hostess, a fashion magazine model, a rock star, a pop singer, a Broadway actress, an Academy Award-winning movie star, a disco sensation, and the subject of a mountain of press coverage." ...|$|E
500|$|Tor Cardona of the {{magazine}} Grazia Daily praised the fact the perfume was announced a week after Beyoncé's fifth album, noting she was set for a [...] "world domination" [...] in 2014. Focusing on the scent, Cardona advised female readers to buy it {{and went on to}} state [...] "With hints of orchid, golden apricot and jasmine- we reckon this might just be 2014's hottest scent." [...] BET editor Dorkys Ramos described the scent as a mixture of [...] "sexy, floral" [...] notes. The Daily Telegraphs Katy Young called the gold symphony orchid used in the scent [...] "the queen of orchids". She also said that notes of cashmere musk and vetiver [...] "give the whole blend a grounding element" [...] before concluding [...] "the notes are not wrong". Charlie Gowans Eglinton of Elle, noted that the perfume promised to be [...] "almost as intoxicating as Bey herself" [...] with a [...] "sexy scent" [...] of musk according to reports she had read. In a guide for spring perfumes to buy in 2014, editors of E!

It does leave you with some nice open questions." [...] Asked whether a sequel would be a direct prequel to Alien, Lindelof said: [...] "If we're fortunate enough to do a sequel... it will tangentialize even further away from the original Alien." [...] In June 2012, Lindelof said that while plot elements were deliberately left unresolved {{so that they could}} be answered in a sequel, he and Scott had thoroughly discussed what should be resolved so that Prometheus could stand alone, as a sequel was not guaranteed. Scott said that a sequel would follow Shaw to her next destination, [...] "because if it is paradise, paradise cannot be <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> it is. Paradise has a connotation of being extremely sinister and ominous." [...] Lindelof cast doubt on his participation, and said, [...] "if [...] wants me to be involved in something, that would be hard to say no to. At the same time, I do feel like [...] might benefit from a fresh voice or a fresh take or a fresh thought." [...] Scott said that an additional film would be required {{to bridge the gap between}} the Prometheus sequel and Alien. Scott later stated it would take an additional two sequels to bridge the gap to Alien.|$|E

Of Dylan's storyline and involvement in the love triangle, Phelps said: [...] "Dylan does come to town to find Avery but this story has much more complexity than that [...] <b>What</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> is going to happen is not what's going to happen." [...] She noted that Avery was the [...] "great love of his life", though she may not have [...] "the same feelings for him." [...] Avery believed that Dylan died during war; TVLine commented that [...] "such a resurrection" [...] would [...] "surely" [...] derail her romance with Nick. During an interview with MSN, Burton said, [...] "Nick and Dylan will definitely fight for her, but ultimately, it's going to be her choice." [...] Dylan and Avery had an affair while she was still married to her ex-husband, but still had a [...] "great relationship", which was shown through flashbacks. Dylan's primary goal in coming to Genoa City was to make sure she was happy, and if she wanted to get back together. Burton said that Dylan can't get Avery off his mind {{despite the fact that she}} had moved on.|$|E
500|$|Some of {{the cast}} was not happy with Fincher's {{exacting}} ways and perfectionism. Some scenes required upwards of 70 takes. [...] Gyllenhaal was frustrated by the director's methods and commented in an interview, [...] "You get a take, 5 takes, 10 takes. Some places, 90 takes. But there is a stopping point. There's {{a point at which}} you go, 'That's what we have to work with.' But we would reshoot things. So there came a point where I would say, well, what do I do? Where's the risk?" [...] Downey said, [...] "I just decided, aside from several times I wanted to garrote him, that I was going to give him what he wanted. I think I'm a perfect person to work for him, because I understand gulags". Fincher responded, [...] "If an actor is going to let the role come to them, they can't resent the fact that I'm willing to wait as long as that takes. You know, the first day of production in San Francisco we shot 56 takes of Mark and Jake – and it's the 56th take that's in the movie". Ruffalo also backed up his director's methods when he said, [...] "The way I see it is, you enter into someone else's world as an actor. You can put your expectations aside and have an experience that's new and pushes and changes you, or hold on to <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> it should be and have a stubborn, immovable journey that's filled with disappointment and anger." ...|$|E

[...] Picking out [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] {{as one of the}} four top tracks of the album, Spence D of IGN Music added that the song slows things down, allowing for Knowles' [...] "crystal clear vocals to take some down time and relinquish up a dreamy, creamy sound that is playfully sensuous." [...] Andy Kellman of Allmusic described [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] as [...] "a deceptively sweet, rainbow-colored track" [...] where purrs - that are sound made by all species of felids and are a part of cat communication - are more like [...] "claws-out dismissals."

He went on complimenting [...] "the squishy R keyboard which works well with the song’s 'I’m not feelin it' vibe." [...] A writer of Seattle Post-Intelligencer commented, [...] "Beyoncé is better at being sexy than sarcastic, and 'Kitty Kat' doesn't make any bones about what her absentee lover is missing." [...] Michael Roberts of New Times Broward-Palm Beach commented that Knowles [...] "purrs at lower speed" [...] in the song.|$|E
