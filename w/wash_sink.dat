40|$|Heavy gauge {{thermoforming}} on {{an industrial}} scale often involves small production series. The {{cost of the}} mold then constitutes a considerable part of the production cost. Besides this financial aspect, thermoforming is primarily an experience and trial and error based technology, resulting in suboptimal processes and lengthy optimization procedures. This paper presents a potential solution for both aspects. In the first place, the use of Single Point Incremental Forming (SPIF), as a technique to produce thermoforming molds based on mechanically deformed thin sheets of metal, is presented. Secondly, the use of Digital Image Correlation (DIC) as a technology to aid the thermoformer in reducing setup times and trial and error cycles is elaborated. A SPIF mold of a <b>washing</b> <b>sink</b> is produced and the deformation during thermoforming of a high impact polystyrene (HIPS) sheet is measured by a DIC setup, mounted on the machine, allowing for an in situ 3 D reconstruction of the final product, and full field wall thickness measurements.

40|$|Background: Nosocomial infections {{acquired}} during hospitalization {{depend on}} the characteristics of the microorganisms, with a high risk of these being acquired when the environment is contaminated. Cross-transmission of microorganisms by contaminated surfaces and the hands of health care workers are considered to be the main route of the spread of nosocomial infections and in many Mexican hospitals, information about microbial and fungi contaminants on indoor surfaces is insufficient. Objectives: In this study, we explore the bacterial and fungal genera present on surfaces taken from; armrest beds, <b>wash</b> <b>sinks,</b> medical tables, and the hands of medical staff from emergency, intensive care unit, inhalation therapy, stomatology and pediatric areas. Materials and Methods: The present study was conducted in a hospital located in Xalapa City in Mexico; the samples were taken during a 6 month period from August to December, 2010. Surface swab specimens were collected from predefined surfaces with cotton tipped applicators, pre-moistened with sterile saline and inoculated on Sabouraud dextrose or selective Eosin-Methylene Blue agar plates and incubated for 1 to 7 days at 28 °C or 37 °C in three triplications in order to isolate bacterial and fungal contaminants. Results: We isolated and identified gram-negative bacteria and fungi and the results showed that the predominant bacteria were; Klebsiella spp. Pseudomonas spp. and E coli spp. The predominant genera of fungi were; Cladosporium spp. Microsporum canis., Aspergillus spp. and Penicillium spp. Conclusions: This study showed that all areas of the hospital have pathogenic fungi and bacteria, indicating that these are a potential source of cross-infection from the hands of health care workers to their patients [...] Implication for health policy/practice/research/medical education:Identification of bacterial and fungal contamination in indoor surfaces would be the key elements in order {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} aseptic techniques that can be applied and contribute to better preventive measures against infectious diseases caused by nosocomial pathogens.
