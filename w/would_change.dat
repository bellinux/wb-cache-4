5|$|When the NFL and AFL merged in 1970, the Patriots {{were placed}} in the American Football Conference (AFC) East division, where they still play today. The {{following}} year, the Patriots moved to a new stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, which would serve as their home for the next 30 years. As a result of the move, they announced they <b>would</b> <b>change</b> their name from the Boston Patriots to the Bay State Patriots. The name was rejected by the NFL and on March 22, 1971, the team officially announced they <b>would</b> <b>change</b> its geographic name to New England.|$|E
5|$|In April 2013, Miliband pledged {{ahead of}} the {{upcoming}} county elections that Labour <b>would</b> <b>change</b> planning laws to give local authorities greater authority to decide what shops can open in their high streets. He also said that Labour would introduce more strenuous laws relating to pay-day lenders and betting shops. Labour subsequently gained nearly 300 councillors, as well as control of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire County Councils.|$|E

5|$|Toyota Motor Company {{teamed up}} with Fujitsu Ten to develop an {{automatic}} warning system for hybrids and electric vehicles to alert pedestrians when the car is propelled by its electric motor.

5|$|A {{series of}} reports {{in the summer of}} 1944 {{produced}} by Bomber Command's operational research division attempted to explain these differences, starting with problems in the bombsight itself. However, almost all of the reasons ultimately offered were purely operational in nature. These included the fact that the target indicator flares used as a reference covered an area of , that the bombers were dropping salvos of bombs, not a single test bomb, and that the Master Bomber <b>would</b> <b>change</b> the marking point during the process of the raid, making it very difficult to correlate the bomb craters to the marking.|$|E
5|$|As the condor's {{population}} {{continued to}} decline, discussion began about starting a captive breeding {{program for the}} birds. Opponents to this plan argued that the condors {{had the right to}} freedom, that capturing all of the condors <b>would</b> <b>change</b> the species' habits forever, and that the cost was too great. However, the project received the approval of the United States government, and the capture of the remaining wild condors was completed on Easter Sunday 1987, when AC-9, the last wild condor, was captured. At that point, there were only 22 condors in existence, all in captivity.|$|E

5|$|In fall of 1946, the {{division}} was reactivated in the U.S. Army Reserve as the 100th Airborne Division in Louisville, Kentucky. This distinction {{as one of}} the few airborne divisions within the U.S. Army was brief; in 1952 {{the division}} was once again redesignated the 100th Infantry Division. It <b>would</b> <b>change</b> names again in 1955, this time to 100th Division (Replacement Training). It would once again be reorganized in 1959 to its present designation as 100th Division (Institutional Training). Its mission became to teach basic, advanced, and common training skills to soldiers from the Army's active, reserve, and National Guard components.|$|E
5|$|In late 2000 the {{chairman}} considered moving {{the club to}} Maine Road, the former home of rivals Manchester City. The potential move was unpopular with supporters, and protests were staged after {{it was suggested that}} the club <b>would</b> <b>change</b> its name to Man-Stock County after the move. Ultimately Manchester City Council decreed that Sale Sharks would make better tenants. Maine Road has since been demolished {{to make way for a}} housing estate and Edgeley Park was then shared with Sale whose Parent Company Cheshire Sports owned the ground.|$|E
5|$|Jolliffe's motives {{regarding}} his accusations, {{as well as}} his choice of words, would be questioned for many years afterwards. That <b>would</b> <b>change.</b> In the late 1970s, when David Lewis was doing research for his Memoirs he came across archival evidence proving the charge. Due to Lewis's discovery, Drew's son Edward, placed extremely restrictive conditions on his father's papers housed in the Public Archives of Canada that continue as of 2010.|$|E

5|$|Large {{amounts of}} {{radioactive}} lanthanum were dispersed by the explosions; 254 tests were performed between 1944 and 1961. In 1948 two workers received radiation burns there. The experiments were generally performed {{when the wind}} blew to the north, but occasionally the wind <b>would</b> <b>change</b> direction in the early morning. In 1949 and 1950 the nuclear fallout from the tests was blown over parts of the housing area and a road; the radiation levels on the road occasionally reached 5-10mR/h and the road had to be closed for a while.|$|E
5|$|Some of the studio's most {{impressive}} releases were foreign productions. In 1927, FBO {{picked up for}} U.S. distribution a celebrated Austrian biblical spectacular made three years earlier: Die Sklavenkönigin (The Slave Queen, aka Moon of Israel) had already won its director, Michael Kertész, a job with Warner Bros. In Hollywood, he <b>would</b> <b>change</b> his name to Michael Curtiz. Una Nueva y gloriosa nación (1928), the most successful film {{in the history of}} Argentine silent cinema, was shot in Hollywood and distributed in the United States by FBO as The Charge of the Gauchos.|$|E
5|$|Stephen Morris {{has said}} that even without Curtis's suicide, it was {{unlikely}} that Joy Division would have endured as they were. The members of Joy Division had made a pact long before Curtis's death that, should any member leave, the remaining members <b>would</b> <b>change</b> the name of the group. Eventually renaming themselves New Order, the band was reborn as a three-piece with Sumner assuming vocal duties; the group later recruited Morris's girlfriend Gillian Gilbert to round out the line-up as keyboardist and second guitarist. Starting as a member of punk group The Inadequates, Gilbert had become friends with the band's members and had played guitar at a Joy Division performance when Curtis had been unable to play.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} that the player controlled <b>would</b> <b>change</b> as they progressed through the game. The creators sought {{to have the}} player control Spock {{during one of the}} Vulcan's mind melds. The ending of the game would have seen the player control Kirk, Spock and Chekov in an attempt to stop the titular superweapon. The interface for the game revolved around a menu which appears after the mouse button is held down while the cursor is hovering over an object. This was to prevent the need for controls to be shown on screen at all times, {{in a manner similar to}} LucasArts games of that period.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships of}} this era had no {{permanent}} battery of guns; guns were completely portable and were often exchanged between ships as situations warranted. Each commanding officer modified his vessel's armaments to his liking while {{taking into consideration}} {{factors such as the}} overall tonnage of cargo, complement of personnel aboard, and planned routes to be sailed. Consequently, a vessel's armament <b>would</b> <b>change</b> often during its career; records of the changes were not generally kept.|$|E
5|$|After the gubernatorial {{election}} in 1999, Louisville senator Dan Seum announced he <b>would</b> <b>change</b> his party affiliation from Democrat to Republican, citing his conservative voting history, including {{opposition to the}} state lottery, KERA, and abortion. This switch, which Patton learned of too late to intervene, equalized the number of Democrats and Republicans in the Senate. Six weeks later, Paducah senator Bob Leeper announced he would also change his party affiliation. Patton traveled to Paducah and met with Leeper, {{but was unable to}} convince him to remain a Democrat. Leeper had a history of conflict with Democratic Senate President Larry Saunders, but he insisted his party switch, like Seum's, was based on political philosophy. Leeper's switch gave Republicans a majority in the Senate {{for the first time in}} the state's history. David Williams was elected President of the Senate, and held the Republican majority together effectively. Consequently, Patton faced a difficult task in maneuvering his agenda through a divided General Assembly.|$|E

The change in Australian English vowels was investigated by means of a cross-sectional apparent time study of 54 subjects covering three generations of speakers, taken from the Australian National Database of Spoken Language.

5|$|After {{the ride}} was renovated in 1990, a new space theme was given. The {{story of the}} ride was the {{passengers}} had been to deliver cargo from a suborbital factory to a station in Alaska. Large screen projections, simulated lasers, mist, and recordings {{were added to the}} ride. In the queue, guests would go through three rooms including Rocket Recovery, Mission Control and Repair Bay. The original entrance to the ride was located next to Troika. During HalloWeekends, the park <b>would</b> <b>change</b> the entrance of Disaster Transport to under the lift hill, leaving the one next to Troika to be used for the Halloween Haunt. For the 2009 season, the entrance was permanently changed to under the lift hill. When the entrance was changed, the Rocket Recovery and Mission Control rooms were closed, leaving the Repair Bay the only room guests walked through.|$|E
5|$|Alonso was ever-present in {{the first}} team in the 2005–06 season, largely {{avoiding}} injuries that had marred his first season at the club. The summer transfer window brought Peter Crouch to Liverpool and the striker's height sparked accusations that the team <b>would</b> <b>change</b> to long ball tactics. Crouch denied this, highlighting that Alonso's passing ability, alongside Gerrard, would define Liverpool's style of play. Alonso faced more competition for {{his place in the}} form of new arrival Mohamed Sissoko. However, Steven Gerrard's injuries and Rafael Benítez's favouring of a 4–5–1 formation ensured Alonso's place in the team. Alonso appeared in all of Liverpool's games in the Champions League but the dominance shown in the previous season had gone as the team lost to Benfica in the knockout stage.|$|E
5|$|As the game's {{dialogue}} {{consists of}} a lot of wordplay and misunderstandings, Smith would analyze scenes before writing them: he would see what the scenes were trying to accomplish, and where the beats in them were. After he had the structure of a scene in his head, he would write it; at times he was able {{to make use of the}} original Japanese dialogue, but most of the time he had to come up with new ideas himself. At several points, the English wordplay was inspired by the wordplay in the Japanese version. At some points, it was not possible to do wordplay in the same places as in the Japanese version, so Smith <b>would</b> <b>change</b> the structure of the scene slightly. At other points, Smith came up with a joke or funny line, and changed the scene to make the joke work. Around half of the jokes were rewritten based on the characters present in the scene, rather than being translations of the Japanese jokes.|$|E
