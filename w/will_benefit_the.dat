5|$|DragonFly BSD {{supports}} Amiga-style resident applications feature: {{it takes}} a snapshot of a large, dynamically linked program's virtual memory space after loading, allowing future instances of the program to start {{much more quickly than}} it otherwise would have. This replaces the prelinking capability that was being worked on earlier in the project's history, as the resident support is much more efficient. Large programs like those found in KDE Software Compilation with many shared libraries <b>will</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>the</b> most from this support.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the work carried out by {{accountants}} and auditors requires a high level of ethics. Shareholders, potential shareholders, and other users of the financial statements rely heavily on the yearly financial statements of a company as they can use this information to make an informed decision about investment. They rely on the opinion of the accountants who prepared the statements, as well as the auditors that verified it, to present a true and fair view of the company. Knowledge of ethics can help accountants and auditors to overcome ethical dilemmas, allowing for the right choice that, although it may not benefit the company, <b>will</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>the</b> public who relies on the accountant/auditor's reporting.|$|E

Her target is to build more schools within the 5-kilometer range of IP communities. She is in favor in giving free education in all levels up to college.

25|$|For {{much of the}} United States' history, {{fossil fuels}} {{have been a major}} energy source. While phasing out these fossil fuels <b>will</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>the</b> world climate in the long run, little has been done to stop burning fossil fuels and {{emitting}} CO2 into the atmosphere. If the United States effectively phases out fossil fuels, tons of energy in the form of oil, coal, and natural gas will be left untouched under the surface of the ground. Although this energy source is limited, companies and workers continue to drill into the Earth to extract it all.|$|E
25|$|Volunteering has {{the ability}} {{to improve the quality of}} life and health of those who donate their time and {{research}} has found that older adults <b>will</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>the</b> most from volunteering. Physical and mental ailments plaguing older adults can be healed through the simple act of helping others; however, one must be performing the good deed from a selfless nature. There are barriers that can prevent older adults from participating in volunteer work, such as socio-economic status, opinions held by others, and even current health issues. However, these barriers can be overcome so that if one would like to be involved in volunteer work they can do so. Volunteering improves not only the communities in which one serves, but also the life of the individual who is providing help to the community.|$|E

25|$|The $500 million ten-year {{contract}} between UC Berkeley, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and BP (formerly BP Amoco), {{one of the}} world's largest energy production companies, officially went into effect Wednesday November 14, 2007 following approval {{by a majority of}} the faculty. The grant is the largest in the University's history. The deal has garnered criticism from some students and faculty who claim the agreement was negotiated in secret, and that it threatens Berkeley's reputation as an autonomous and democratic institution of higher learning. Supporters of the deal, on the other hand, assert that the infusion of capital from the venture <b>will</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>the</b> campus as a whole at a time when public universities are dealing with increasing cuts in State and Federal funding. They also point out that the BP deal focuses on developing alternative energy, an important issue in today's world.|$|E
25|$|There are strong, direct {{relationships}} between agricultural productivity, hunger, poverty, and sustainability. Three-quarters of the world's poor live {{in rural areas}} and make their living from agriculture. Hunger and child malnutrition are greater in these areas than in urban areas. Moreover, the higher {{the proportion of the}} rural population that obtains its income solely from subsistence farming (without the benefit of pro-poor technologies and access to markets), the higher the incidence of malnutrition. Therefore, improvements in agricultural productivity aimed at small-scale farmers <b>will</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>the</b> rural poor first. Food and feed crop demand is likely to double in the next 50 years, as the global population approaches nine billion. Growing sufficient food will require people to make changes such as increasing productivity in areas dependent on rainfed agriculture; improving soil fertility management; expanding cropped areas; investing in irrigation; conducting agricultural trade between countries; and reducing gross food demand by influencing diets and reducing post-harvest losses.|$|E
25|$|Once {{detection}} becomes public, decision-makers would exert influence by the {{way they}} evaluate the importance and handle the publicity of the discovery. It is possible that such actors would emphasize or minimize its importance to extract political advantage. The contact could be framed as a positive development that <b>will</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>the</b> nation and humankind. Likewise, it could be used to warn of potential dangers and provoke public anxieties. Each course of action would have profound effects on how the press and the general public react. Michaud posits that the more decipherable the information received from contact with ETI, the higher a chance there is for political reaction against alien cultural influences. Extremist groups, both religious and secular, could weigh in, attacking information from ETI as evil or immoral. It is possible that this would spark attempts to terminate communication by interfering with the signal or targeting the detecting technology with attacks. Albert Harrison has written that it would be “foolish and negligent” to fail to anticipate such reactions in the formulation of policies and plans.|$|E

25|$|Public {{transportation}} is currently {{served by the}} commuter boat ferry service from the Hingham Shipyard to Rowes Wharf in downtown Boston, the MBTA's Bus Route 220, with Route 222 also passing through a small section of town, and the MBTA Commuter Rail to Boston South Station. Commuter rail has been restored along the Greenbush Line through Hingham. Trains stop at two stations in town; West Hingham and Nantasket Junction. As part of the MBTA's agreement to restore train service, a tunnel has been built to carry the commuter trains under historic Hingham Square. There were disputes in Hingham about whether to allow the train {{to pass through the}} town. Some people felt that Hingham is becoming less like a town and more like a small city. Others felt that the line <b>will</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>the</b> town. Ferries also run from Hingham Shipyard to several islands in Boston Harbor during the summer as well as to Pemberton Point, Hull. There is no air service in the town; the nearest airport is Logan International Airport in Boston as well as smaller public airports in Norwood and Marshfield.|$|E

500|$|In 2007 {{controversy}} about the academic program arose, {{when members of}} the Baltimore City College Alumni Association argued that the IB Program was diverting a significant amount of the school's resources to benefit a fraction of the student population.

[...] Some members also argued that the rigidity of the program did not give students enough flexibility. [...] Citing these concerns, the alumni association encouraged the school to replace the IB Program with the [...] "A course" [...] and expand the number of Advanced Placement courses offered. In December 2008 City announced the donation of $50,000 by alumnus H. Corbin Gwaltney '39.
