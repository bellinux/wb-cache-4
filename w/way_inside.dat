5|$|McLamore and Edgerton {{acquired}} {{a license to}} operate an Insta-Burger King franchise and opened their first location on 4 December 1954 at 3090 NW 36th Street in Miami. By 1959, the pair had stores at several locations within the Miami-Dade area, and operations were growing at a fast rate. However, the partners discovered that the insta-broiler units' heating elements were prone to degradation from the drippings of the beef patties. The pair eventually created a mechanized gas grill that avoided the problems by cooking the meat patties a different <b>way</b> <b>inside</b> the unit. The new cooking appliance, which they called a flame broiler, moved the patties over the flame vertically on a chain link conveyor over the heating elements, a design that imparted grill lines on the patties similar to those made on a charcoal grill. The new unit worked so well that they {{made the decision to}} replace all of their Insta-Broilers with the newly designed unit.|$|E

Warehouses pay out more than rackets and hubs pay out more than warehouses. Ultimately, the player must tackle the enemies' strongest holdout - their compound.

25|$|As in {{the first}} crusade, the pilgrims and {{soldiers}} did not leave {{as a part of}} one large army, but rather in several groups from various different regions from across Western Europe. In September 1100, a large group of Lombards left from Milan. These were mostly untrained peasants, led by Anselm IV, Archbishop of Milan. When they reached the territory of the Byzantine Empire, they pillaged it recklessly, and Byzantine emperor Alexios I escorted them to a camp outside Constantinople. This did not satisfy them, and they made their <b>way</b> <b>inside</b> the city where they pillaged the Blachernae palace, even killing Alexios' pet lion. The Lombards were quickly ferried across the Bosporus and made their camp at Nicomedia, to wait for reinforcements.|$|E
25|$|During the 1964 UK general {{election}} campaign, an Irish republican candidate displayed an Irish tricolour {{from the window}} of his office in a republican area of Belfast. Paisley threatened that if the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) did not remove the tricolour he would lead a march to the office and take it down himself. The Flags and Emblems Act banned the public display of any symbol, {{with the exception of the}} Union Flag, that could cause a breach of the peace. In response, armed officers arrived at the building, smashed their <b>way</b> <b>inside</b> and seized the flag. This led to severe rioting between republicans and the RUC. Thirty people, including at least 18 officers, had to be hospitalized. The 1969 Northern Ireland riots, Divis Street were the worst in Belfast since the 1930s.|$|E

40|$|The development, {{survival}} and activation of lymphocytes {{is controlled by}} a multitude of extracellular signals {{in the form of}} soluble or membrane-bound ligands. Binding of these ligands to receptors on the lymphocyte surface is translated into intracellular signals that are processed in various <b>ways</b> <b>inside</b> the cell and determine its fate. The processing of an incoming signal involves amplification, diversification and termination. Feedback signalling loops have an essential role in the control of these processes, yet our knowledge about these regulatory loops is limited.

This contradicted earlier statements made by senior Russian officials that all of the submariners had died before the submarine hit the bottom.

The rescue teams conducted ongoing measurements of radiation levels inside and outside the submarine but none of the readings exceeded normal ranges.|$|E

In the castle, conflict arose between the Teutonic and Polish knights, with the latter opposing a take-over by the former.

25|$|While often formal, Seymour hides {{a twisted}} desire to save Spira by {{becoming}} Sin and destroying the world. This resulted from his father's treatment {{who had his}} wife and son exiled to the island of Baaj since Seymour was considered an abomination by the Guados. Afterwards, Seymour's mother gave her life in the Baaj Temple to become the fayth of the aeon Anima, believing that by sacrificing herself for Spira's temporary peace against Sin, her son will be accepted by Spira's people. At eighteen years of age, Seymour's exile was revoked and he soon killed Jyscal and took his position. He asks summoner Yuna to marry him, seemingly to further unite Spira, as they both have mixed parentage, being the offspring of a human and another race. When Yuna's guardians learn of Seymour's motives, they stand against him and kill him. Seymour's spirit is able to remain in the living world and become an unsent. Seymour later reveals his plans for Yuna – to have her turn him into the next Sin. His pyreflies are later absorbed by Sin. There, Seymour begins seeking a means to control the creature from within. During this process, he is confronted a final time by Yuna and her guardians, who manage to break their <b>way</b> <b>inside</b> the creature's body. However, he is defeated and is sent to the Farplane by Yuna.|$|E

25|$|Ekadantanāśanam (Sanskrit: एकदन्तनाशनम्). On the Mahendra mountain, Paraśurāma meditates on {{the form}} of Śiva. He decides that his axe would be calmed only on seeing Śiva. When Paraśurāma reaches Kailāsa, he meets Śiva's son Gaṇeśa at the entrance. Gaṇeśa asks Paraśurāma to wait, as Śiva is {{performing}} the afternoon Sandhyā ritual. Paraśurāma gets angry and starts boasting about his valour and axe, to which Gaṇeśa responds by mocking his axe {{that was used to}} kill his own mother and infant Kṣatriyas. Paraśurāma is further infuriated and tries to force his <b>way</b> <b>inside,</b> but the elephant-headed Gaṇeśa throws him back using his trunk. Paraśurāma tries to injure Gaṇeśa by throwing his axe at him, which breaks the left tusk of Gaṇeśa. The Bhūtas (goblin attendants) of Śiva attack Paraśurāma to kill him, but Gaṇeśa stops them. Pārvatī arrives and chides Paraśurāma for breaking the tusk of the son of his guru. She curses Paraśurāma by saying that his axe will disappear in Rāma just as the lightning disappears in the clouds, and his bow and arrows, along with his Kalās will all be transferred to Rāma. She further says that the single-tusked Gaṇeśa, who showed restraint by not avenging the breaking of his tusk, will be worshipped everywhere. Paraśurāma pleases Pārvatī and apologizes to Gaṇeśa. He then bows down to Śiva and returns to his Āśrama.|$|E
25|$|The National Park Service {{chose to}} {{refinish}} the statues using brush electroplating. Workers discovered {{that because the}} interior of each pedestal was exposed to bare earth, excessive condensation built up inside the hollow statues. Additionally, the statues had not been completely seated on their plinths, and additional moisture worked its <b>way</b> <b>inside</b> through the poorly sealed joint. Extreme temperature changes (due to daytime heating and nighttime cooling of the bronze) and proximity to the river also led to extensive condensation inside the statures. Workers found the interior of each statue damp, even wet, and water pooled in every recess. The moisture build-up created tremendous galvanic corrosion inside the sculptures. The steel joint bolts were so extensively corroded that some had almost completely disintegrated, {{and many of the}} steel angle irons were close to failure. National Bureau of Standards workers believed all four statues {{were on the verge of}} structural collapse. The corrosion problem was worsened by the presence of gypsum. Gypsum was used to make the molds from which the bronze was cast. But the gypsum was never completely cleaned from the interior of the two The Arts of Peace statues, leading to additional corrosion in these pieces. The corrosion problems were solved by removing the steel bolts and angle irons and replacing them with bronze components, and by cleaning as much gypsum as possible from the statue interiors. More than 1,000 brass bolts were used in Music and Harvest and Aspiration and Literature alone.|$|E
