40|$|The edible <b>wild</b> <b>mushrooms</b> {{are most}} {{important}} in food security of ethnic groups and tribals throughout the world. Various indigenous strategies are followed to trace <b>wild</b> <b>mushrooms</b> suitable for human consumption. Data {{presented in this article}} projects ethnic knowledge on 51 edible <b>wild</b> <b>mushrooms</b> (in 23 genera) in the Western Ghats region of India. Information collected with support of ethnic groups/tribals pertains to habitats, substrates, mutualistic association, extent of availability, extent of edibility and method of processing of <b>wild</b> <b>mushrooms.</b> Extensive field visits and interactions with ethnic groups were performed to collect the data on each mushroom. Initially, most of these mushrooms were identified based on the indigenous methods and designated with vernacular names (Are-Gowda, Kodava and Tulu). Based on macromorphology (in field) and micromorphology (in laboratory), each mushroom was identified with its systematic name. Among the 51 <b>wild</b> <b>mushrooms</b> irrespective of extent of availability, the most preferred include Astraeus hygrometricus, Clitocybe infundibuliformis, Fistulina hepatica, Lentinus sajor-caju, Pleurotus (5 spp.) and Scleroderma citrinum and Termitomyces (18 spp.). This data forecasts the importance of documentation of traditional knowledge, protection of habitats, management of resources (tree species and substrates) and sustainable exploitation of <b>wild</b> <b>mushrooms...</b>|$|R
40|$|Aim of study: To {{review and}} provide {{all-purpose}} information about <b>wild</b> <b>mushrooms</b> in Ethiopia {{and to create}} awareness for conservation and use of mycological resources. Area of study: We focused mainly on Ethiopia, where information about <b>wild</b> <b>mushrooms</b> is scanty and their status is unknown under the rampant degradation of the habitats. Main results: We reviewed all relevant references related to <b>wild</b> <b>mushrooms</b> and their ecological niches, cultural practices and species used for cultivation {{as well as the}} anthropogenic factors affecting the conservation of fungal diversity. Research highlights: This review summarizes issues related to the diversity of <b>wild</b> <b>mushrooms,</b> the main ecological niches and their associated fungal species, and mushroom cultivation practices in Ethiopia. Moreover, threats and the need for future conservation of <b>wild</b> <b>mushrooms</b> in the country are also reported.

25|$|A {{number of}} species of {{mushrooms}} are poisonous; although some resemble certain edible species, consuming them could be fatal.

500|$|Boletus edulis, as {{the species}} epithet edulis {{directly}} implies, is an edible mushroom.

It may be served either in a soup bowl or – especially at dinner parties – as a hot beverage in a twin-handled cup, with a croquette or a filled pastry on the side. Unlike other types of borscht, it is not whitened with sour cream. , or Christmas Eve borscht, is a variant of the clear borscht that is traditionally served during the Polish Christmas Eve supper. In this version, meat stock is either omitted or replaced with fish broth, usually made by boiling the heads cut off from fish used in other Christmas Eve dishes.

LSE and LZE displayed good scavenging activity against 2, 2 -Diphenyl- 1 -Picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and ferrous ion radicals at concentration of 2 mg/mL. However, TRE and TCE exhibited better superoxide anion scavenging effect at 2 mg/mL.
