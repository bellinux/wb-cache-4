25|$|The {{structure}} of hardwoods is more complex. The <b>water</b> <b>conducting</b> capability is mostly {{taken care of}} by vessels: in some cases (oak, chestnut, ash) these are quite large and distinct, in others (buckeye, poplar, willow) too small to be seen without a hand lens. In discussing such woods it is customary to divide them into two large classes, ring-porous and diffuse-porous.|$|E
25|$|In diffuse-porous woods, as {{has been}} stated, the vessels or pores are even-sized, so that the <b>water</b> <b>conducting</b> {{capability}} is scattered throughout the ring instead of collected in the earlywood. The effect of rate of growth is, therefore, {{not the same as}} in the ring-porous woods, approaching more nearly the conditions in the conifers. In general it may be stated that such woods of medium growth afford stronger material than when very rapidly or very slowly grown. In many uses of wood, total strength is not the main consideration. If ease of working is prized, wood should be chosen with regard to its uniformity of texture and straightness of grain, which will in most cases occur when there is little contrast between the latewood of one season's growth and the earlywood of the next.|$|E

50|$|Mosses in {{the genus}} Polytrichum are endohydric, meaning water must be {{conducted}} {{from the base}} of the plant. While mosses are considered non-vascular plants, those of Polytrichum show clear differentiation of <b>water</b> <b>conducting</b> tissue. One of these <b>water</b> <b>conducting</b> tissues is termed the hydrome, which makes up the central cylinder of stem tissue. It consists of cells with a relatively wide diameter called hydroids, which conduct water. This tissue is analogous to xylem in higher plants. The other tissue is called leptome, which surrounds the hydrome, contains smaller cells and is analogous to phloem.|$|E

The other tissue is called leptom, which surround the hadrom and contains smaller cells. This tissue is, on the other hand, analogous to phloem. When these two tissue types are taken into account along with the species' exceptional height, it becomes clear that common haircap moss is quite a unique moss considering that the majority of species show little differentiation of conducting tissue and are restricted to much smaller stem lengths.|$|E

40|$|In the post-operational {{phase of}} a Low/Intermediate-Low {{radioactive}} waste repository, gas will be generated in the caverns due to anaerobic corrosion of metals, and also chemical and microbial degradation of organic substances. Previous investigations on gas migration have indicated that discrete <b>water</b> <b>conducting</b> features (e. g. shear zones) are mainly responsible for gas transport from the caverns through the geosphere. Two phase flow processes occur in these <b>water</b> <b>conducting</b> features; the continuity and spatial distribution of pore spaces, the pore size distribution and the interfacial forces of the three phases gas-water-rock have a significant influence on gas transport. The main difficulties to be resolved when simulating two-phase flow processes in fractured rock are: - The description of the internal heterogeneity of the individual <b>water</b> <b>conducting</b> features. The influence of channelling along preferential flow paths {{is even more important}} than for single phase fluid flow, because gas transport takes place more or less exclusively along the most transmissive channels. - The determination of effective mass exchange coefficients of the relevant components of the system. Mass exchange may occur between three phases (gas-water-rock). It depends on the spatial distribution of water and gas along the <b>water</b> <b>conducting</b> features (i. e. specific surface of contact areas between phases), and on the solubility and diffusivity of the different components, but also on a couple of state variables of liquid phase (initial content of dissolve/free gas, initial pressure). The work presented in this thesis aims to improve the understanding of the physics of single and multiphase transport phenomena, to be able to develop a quantitative description of gas transport in shear zones to overcome in a satisfactory way the problems described above.
