50|$|Early mariners {{noticed that}} wet sails were more {{efficient}} than dry sails, but due to their weight slowed the vessel down. From the 15th century, mariners applied fish oils and grease to their heavy sailcloth, out of the worn remnants of which they cut <b>waterproof</b> <b>capes</b> to keep themselves dry, the forerunner of the fisherman's slicker. The result was efficient sails in dry weather, lighter sails in wet weather, and drier sailors throughout.|$|E
5000|$|International Charitable Foundation [...] "Resistance Movement" [...] was {{established}} on April 24, 2014 to help defenders of Ukraine who {{fight for the}} territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine. The Foundation {{was established}} by Yulia Tymoshenko, the head of political party [...] "Batkivshchyna" [...] (Motherland). Since {{the beginning of the}} military conflict until today 35 mln. UAH have been transferred for the different needs of Ukrainian defenders. The Foundation [...] "Resistance Movement" [...] has spent the donations on uniforms and protective equipment for battalions [...] "Motherland", [...] "Resistance Movement", [...] "Azov", [...] "Aydar": thermal imaging cameras, diesel generators, radio sets, relay stations, tactical sunglasses, tactical vests, body armour, NATO first aid kits, <b>waterproof</b> <b>capes,</b> two combat vehicles, a Grand Cherokee Jeep, a Mercedes Sprinter minivan, warm jackets, heaters, battery charger sets, clothes, personal hygiene products, helmets, binoculars, Celox and other medicines.|$|E
5000|$|In 1730, {{at the age}} of 20, he {{returned}} to Naples. He became a friend of Charles Bourbon, who became king of Naples in 1734, for whom he invented a <b>waterproof</b> <b>cape.</b>|$|R
50|$|Hamilton {{was racing}} an MG Midget in the 1933 Masaryk Grand Prix, when he crashed, after his <b>waterproof</b> <b>cape</b> blew over his eyes. He {{seemed to have}} fully {{recovered}} from the three broken ribs and internal injuries which he sustained, which led to his taking up racing again the following year. However, in the 1934 Swiss Grand Prix, Hamilton, driving a Maserati 8CM, crashed into a tree. This occurred after his front left tyre failed around 1500 meters from the finishing point at 150 km/h. This led to his crashing into a fir tree. Two spectators were hurt in the crash.|$|R
5000|$|Writing as {{a narrator}} {{describing}} events {{from his own}} past, Beerbohm presents himself as a moderately successful young English essayist and writer during the 1890s. He then purports to relate the tragic history of a friend and colleague of his named Enoch Soames. Soames is a contemporary of the younger Beerbohm; a fellow-Englishman of secure but moderate means, living off an inherited annuity, and an utterly obscure, forgettable, miserable, and unknown aspiring poet. Over {{the course of the}} story, he is the author and publisher of a succession of unsuccessful books of poems. His appearance is described as [...] "dim" [...] and leaving little impression, except for his persistent habit of always wearing a particular grey <b>waterproof</b> <b>cape</b> and soft black hat.|$|R
6000|$|One {{takes it}} {{that the people who}} once {{occupied}} these artistic rooms are now all dead. This was their [...] "Dining-Room." [...] They sat on those artistic chairs. They could hardly have used the dinner service set out upon the Elizabethan dresser, because that would have left the dresser bare: one assumes they had an extra service for use, or else that they took their meals in the kitchen. The [...] "Entrance Hall" [...] is a singularly chaste apartment. There is no necessity for a door-mat: people with muddy boots, it is to be presumed, were sent round to the back. A riding-cloak, the relic apparently of a highwayman, hangs behind the door. It is the sort of cloak you would expect to find there--a decorative cloak. An umbrella or a <b>waterproof</b> <b>cape</b> would be fatal to the whole effect.|$|R
5000|$|Shelter-halves {{are usually}} {{designed}} to serve double duty as ponchos against the rain, {{or for the}} concealment of snipers. While the fabric is often simple olive drab, several nations use camouflaged fabric. Indeed, the first printed camouflage for soldiers were the Italian Telo mimetico introduced in 1929 for their half-shelters. The first camouflage uniforms were the Second World War German paratrooper smock, based on their M1931 Splittermuster shelter-halves. Russian Army has used Plasch-palatkas (literally [...] "cape-tents", designed {{to be used as}} both a part of a larger tent cover, or an individual weatherproof cape) since 1894, and the modern version, virtually unchanged since, was introduced in 1936, with the camo version being available since 1942. To add some confusion, the ordinary <b>waterproofed</b> <b>cape</b> with a similar name (plasch-nakidka, [...] "cape-overcoat") was issued at the same time, but these weren't intended to combine with each other.|$|R
2500|$|During the First World War, {{the design}} of the trench coat was {{modified}} to include shoulder straps and D-rings. The shoulder straps were for the attachment of epaulettes or other rank insignia; There is a popular myth that the D-ring was for the attachment of hand grenades. [...] The ring was originally for attaching map cases and swords or other equipment to the belt. This latter pattern was dubbed [...] "trench coat" [...] by the soldiers in the front line. Many trench coats had large pockets for maps and cleverly placed flaps and vents to deal with the odour associated with earlier rubber coats. A range of waterproof coats were designed and sold during wartime that incorporated War Office requirements with traditional aspects of leisurewear. What became known as the ‘trench coat’ combined the features of a military <b>waterproof</b> <b>cape</b> and the regulation greatcoat designed for British officers. Many veterans returning to civilian life kept the coats that became fashionable for both men and women.|$|R
60|$|Before {{their young}} friend was liberated {{there came a}} thump at the door {{communicating}} with the staircase, followed by the apparition of a dripping youth who poked in his head. Pemberton recognised him as the bearer of a telegram and recognised the telegram as addressed to himself. Morgan came back as, after glancing at the signature—that of a relative in London—he was reading the words: “Found a jolly job for you, engagement to coach opulent youth on own terms. Come at once.” The answer happily was paid and the messenger waited. Morgan, who had drawn near, waited too and looked hard at Pemberton; and Pemberton, after a moment, having met his look, handed him the telegram. It was really by wise looks—they knew each other so well now—that, while the telegraph-boy, in his <b>waterproof</b> <b>cape,</b> made a great puddle on the floor, the thing was settled between them. Pemberton wrote the answer with a pencil against the frescoed wall, and the messenger departed. When he had gone the young man explained himself.|$|R
5000|$|... “Constable Locke {{had gone}} on duty at 5.45 pm. on Saturday evening. A heavy {{downfall}} of hail occurred {{at the time when}} the porter of the Sailors' Home came out to close the outer gate, which was a solid and heavy iron structure, opened and shut by being wheeled across the opening. The constable, it appears, had left his <b>waterproof</b> <b>cape</b> at another part of his beat, and had stood inside the entrance of the Sailors' Home to shelter from the storm. Seeing the porter unable to pull the mid section of the gate into place, the officer went to his assistance but had evidently given so strong a pull that the gate had run sharply and snapped the hold back chains, one of which was tied with rope. The gate overshot the guide and toppled outwards from the top. The porter during the operation was inside and the policeman outside the gate. Seeing it begin to fall over, the porter made a grab at it, but was overpowered by the heavy mass, and sustained some injury in being carried with it, while the officer, being beneath, sustained the whole impetus of the downfall. Being a mass of metal weighing about half a tonne, the gate crushed the officer so severely that he was at once rendered unconscious.” ...|$|R
5|$|Known to Māori as tī kōuka, {{the tree}} {{was used as a}} source of food, {{particularly}} in the South Island, where it was cultivated in areas where other crops would not grow. It provided durable fibre for textiles, anchor ropes, fishing lines, baskets, <b>waterproof</b> rain <b>capes</b> and cloaks, and sandals. Hardy and fast growing, C.australis is widely planted in New Zealand gardens, parks and streets, and numerous cultivars are available. The tree can also be found in large numbers in island restoration projects such as Tiritiri Matangi Island, where it was among the first seedling trees to be planted.|$|R
60|$|Let me {{be persuaded}} that my {{neighbour}} Jenkins considers me a blockhead, and I shall never shine {{in conversation with}} him any more. Let me discover that the lovely Phoebe thinks my squint intolerable, and I shall {{never be able to}} fix her blandly with my disengaged eye again. Thank heaven, then, that a little illusion is left to us, to enable us to be useful and agreeable--that we don't know exactly what our friends think of us--that the world is not made of looking-glass, to show us just the figure we are making, and just what is going on behind our backs! By the help of dear friendly illusion, we are able to dream that we are charming and our faces wear a becoming air of self-possession; we are able to dream that other men admire our talents--and our benignity is undisturbed; we are able to dream that we are doing much good--and we do a little. Thus it was with Amos Barton on that very Thursday evening, when he was the subject of the conversation at Cross Farm. He had been dining at Mr. Farquhar's, the secondary squire of the parish, and, stimulated by unwonted gravies and port-wine, had been delivering his opinion on affairs parochial and otherwise with considerable animation. And he was now returning home in the moonlight--a little chill, it is true, for he had just now no greatcoat compatible with clerical dignity, and a fur boa round one's neck, with a <b>waterproof</b> <b>cape</b> over one's shoulders, doesn't frighten away the cold from one's legs; but entirely unsuspicious, not only of Mr. Hackit's estimate of his oratorical powers, but also of the critical remarks passed on him by the Misses Farquhar as soon as the drawing-room door had closed behind him. Miss Julia had observed that she never heard any one sniff so frightfully as Mr. Barton did--she had a great mind to offer him her pocket-handkerchief; and Miss Arabella wondered why he always said he was going for to do a thing. He, excellent man! was meditating fresh pastoral exertions on the morrow; he would set on foot his lending library; in which he had introduced some books that would be a pretty sharp blow to the Dissenters--one especially, purporting to be written by a working man who, out of pure zeal for the welfare of his class, took the trouble to warn them in this way against those hypocritical thieves, the Dissenting preachers. The Rev. Amos Barton profoundly believed in the existence of that working man, and had thoughts of writing to him. Dissent, he considered, would have its head bruised in Shepperton, for did he not attack it in two ways? He preached Low-Church doctrine--as evangelical as anything to be heard in the Independent Chapel; and he made a High-Church assertion of ecclesiastical powers and functions. Clearly, the Dissenters would feel that 'the parson' was too many for them. Nothing like a man who combines shrewdness with energy. The wisdom of the serpent, Mr. Barton considered, was one of his strong points.|$|R
