5|$|A {{group of}} {{powerful}} lords—including the Šubići, Kőszegis and Csáks—urged CharlesII of Naples {{to send his}} grandson, the 12-year-old Charles Robert, to Hungary {{in order to become}} king. The young Charles Robert disembarked in Split in August 1300. Most Croatian and Slavonian lords and all Dalmatian towns but Trogir recognized him as king before he marched to Zagreb. The Kőszegis and Matthew Csák, however, were shortly reconciled <b>with</b> <b>Andrew,</b> preventing Charles' success. Andrew's envoy to the Holy See noted that Pope Boniface VIII did not support Charles Robert's adventure, either.

According to historians Attila Zsoldos and Gyula Kristó, the contemporaneous gossip suggesting that Andrew was poisoned cannot be proved.|$|E

5|$|In {{the absence}} of Bangladesh's opening bowler, Mortaza, Australia opened the innings <b>with</b> <b>Andrew</b> Symonds and Michael Bevan— giving the usual middle-order batsmen time at the crease. The Symonds {{experiment}} did not last long, as he was dismissed by Hasibul Hossain for seven. Martyn joined Bevan at the crease and quickly put the bowlers on the back foot with aggressive batting. Despite returning in the series {{for the first time}} since the 2003 Cricket World Cup because of a broken finger, he scored Australia's second fastest ODI half-century22 ballsand was on track to overtake Gilchrist's and Allan Border's record for the fastest Australian ODI century; 78 deliveries. Together they added 131 runs from 91 balls, seeing Australia home by nine wickets. Named man of the match, Martyn finished with 92 from 51 balls, dominating the partnership with Bevan, who scored 40 from 62 balls. Martyn was especially severe on Bangladeshi captain Khaled Mahmud, hitting three fours and a six from successive balls in Mahmud's second over.

5|$|The Union {{increased}} its pace <b>with</b> <b>Andrew</b> Wenger playing wide {{on the left}} where he repeatedly got past Yedlin {{to get to the}} byline or cut back to shoot.
