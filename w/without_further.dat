5|$|Although {{the early}} workers in Alberta did not {{recognize}} it at the time, they were finding the remains of juvenile Lambeosaurus as well. These fossils of small-bodied crested duckbills were interpreted as adults of a distinct lineage of hadrosaurids, the subfamily Cheneosaurinae. The first such animal to be named was Trachodon altidens, a left upper jaw (GSC 1092) from the Dinosaur Park Formation described by Lawrence Lambe in 1902. In the same volume, Henry Fairfield Osborn suggested T. altidens could belong to a new genus, which he labelled Didanodon <b>without</b> <b>further</b> discussion. In 2006, Lund and Gates stated that Didanodon altidens was a nomen nudum, <b>without</b> <b>further</b> discussion.|$|E

Soon after, Johnston removed Evans for nine, caught by a diving Miller after lashing out at a wide ball outside off stump to leave the hosts at 7/145.|$|E
5|$|Gout may be {{diagnosed}} and treated <b>without</b> <b>further</b> investigations in someone with hyperuricemia and the classic acute arthritis {{of the base}} of the great toe (known as podagra).

The Dodgers pinch hit for Roebuck to lead {{off the top of the}} inning with Ken McMullen and although he singled he did not score. Larry Sherry entered to pitch for the Dodgers in the bottom of the inning and after recording the first out he allowed back-to-back home runs to Mays and Orlando Cepeda to give the Giants a 5–0 lead. Davenport then singled and Sherry was relieved by Jack Smith who finished the inning <b>without</b> <b>further</b> damage.|$|E

5|$|Antiochus III {{launched}} a massive campaign to retake Parthia and Bactria in 210 or 209BC. He was unsuccessful, but did negotiate a peace settlement with Arsaces II.

The Seleucids were unable to further intervene in Parthian affairs following increasing encroachment by the Roman Republic and the Seleucid defeat at Magnesia in 190BC. Phriapatius of Parthia (r. c.191–176BC) succeeded Arsaces II, and Phraates I of Parthia (r. c.176–171BC) eventually ascended the throne.
