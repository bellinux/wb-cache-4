He explained that they [...] "didn't always get what the team was trying to do", and said, [...] "You don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> many times the game came this close to being killed (or how late in the project)". According to Church, Looking Glass' internal management largely ignored System Shock, {{in favor of the}} concurrently-developed Flight Unlimited—the game [...] "that had to be the hit, because it was the self-published title". Spector organized a licensing deal between Electronic Arts and Looking Glass that gave the former the trademark to the game, but the latter the copyright. His goal was to ensure that neither party could continue the franchise without the other's involvement. While Cyberspace was originally conceived as a realistic hacking simulation—which could even be used to reimplement SHODAN's ethical constraints—it was simplified after Origin Systems deemed it too complicated. The game's star field system was written by programmer James Fleming. Marc LeBlanc was the main creator of the game's HUD, which he later believed was too complicated. He said that it was [...] "very much the Microsoft Word school of user interface", in that there was no [...] "feature that you [...] see on the screen and touch and play with".|$|E

For example, a student arrived at one of the five-day intensive seminars he held in his home office {{near the end of his}} life. When Erickson asked why she had come, she replied frankly: [...] "My teacher told me that I should come to see you before you died." [...] Erickson smiled and said: [...] "You tell him that dying is the last thing I intend to do." [...] The group laughed at the pun.

Keith Richards, of the Rolling Stones, said in 1990, [...] "You <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> good the blues can get? Well, this is it." [...] But according to Elijah Wald, in his book Escaping the Delta, Johnson in his own time was most respected for his ability to play {{in a wide range of}} styles, from raw country slide guitar to jazz and pop licks, and for his ability to pick up guitar parts almost instantly upon hearing a song. His first recorded song, [...] "Kind Hearted Woman Blues," [...] in contrast to the prevailing Delta style of the time, more resembled the style of Chicago or St. Louis, with [...] "a full-fledged, abundantly varied musical arrangement." [...] Unusual for a Delta player of the time, a recording exhibits what Johnson could do entirely outside of a blues style. [...] "They're Red Hot", from his first recording session, shows that he was also comfortable with an [...] "uptown" [...] swing or ragtime sound similar to that of the Harlem Hamfats, but as Wald remarked, [...] "no record company was heading to Mississippi in search of a down-home Ink Spots ... e could undoubtedly have come up with a lot more songs in this style if the producers had wanted them."
