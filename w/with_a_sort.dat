She insisted on playing it on everything {{so we had to}} figure out ways to separate her voice from it as much as possible and then find instrumental voices that would be compatible with the harmonium track... As an arranger you're usually trying to take the songs and put a structure on them, but what I thought was valuable was when you took the centre out of the track and worked around the central core of the tonality and changes. That left you <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of floating free-form tapestry behind what she was doing, which is when things became more abstract.|$|E

Due to his partial blindness, he had trouble walking alone in the nights and was unable to read during nights. He was unable to see the numbers written on the blackboard and unable to catch ball while playing. He used to take help from his friends who used to read aloud the school lessons for him.|$|E

25|$|The {{character}} and fortunes of Ronsard's works {{are among the}} most remarkable in literary history, and supply in themselves a kind of illustration of the progress of French literature during the last three centuries. It was long his fortune to be almost always extravagantly admired or violently attacked. At first, as has been said, the enmity, not altogether unprovoked, of the friends and followers of Marot fell to his lot, then the still fiercer antagonism of the Huguenot faction, who, happening to possess a poet of great merit in Du Bartas, were able to attack Ronsard in his tenderest point. But fate had by no means done its worst with him in his lifetime. After his death the classical reaction set in under the auspices of Malherbe, who seems to have been animated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of personal hatred of Ronsard, though {{it is not clear that}} they ever met. After Malherbe, the rising glory of Corneille and his contemporaries obscured the tentative and unequal work of the Pléiade, which was, moreover, directly attacked by Boileau himself, the dictator of French criticism in the last half of the 17th century.|$|E
500|$|The core {{creative}} team {{behind the}} project was Reznor, Atticus Ross, and Alan Moulder. Live-band member Alessandro Cortini and studio musicians Adrian Belew and Brian Viglione also contributed instrumental performances on select tracks. Reznor described the band's early intentions for the project as [...] "an experiment", and explained the group's process: [...] "When we started working with the music, we would generally start <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of visual reference that we had imagined: a place, or a setting, or a situation. And then attempt to describe that with sound and texture and melody. And treat it, in a sense, {{as if it were}} a soundtrack." ...|$|E

[...] Arcel described Walter as having [...] "a very interesting way of seeing the world. He sees it <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of delight, {{even though he is}} obviously {{on the wrong side of}} the light-and-dark spectrum. He’s someone I’ve been having a lot of fun with."

500|$|MacPhisto {{was created}} to parody the devil and was named after Mephistopheles of the Faust legend. Initially called [...] "Mr. Gold", MacPhisto wore a gold lamé suit with gold {{platform}} shoes, pale makeup, lipstick, and devil's horns atop his head. As MacPhisto, Bono spoke with an exaggerated upper-class English accent, {{similar to that of}} a down-on-his-luck character actor. The character was created as a European replacement for the American-influenced Mirror Ball Man. The initial inspiration for MacPhisto came from the stage musical The Black Rider. Realisation of the character did not come about until rehearsal the night before the first of the 1993 shows. According to Bono, [...] "We came up <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of old English Devil, a pop star long past his prime returning regularly from sessions on The Strip in Vegas and regaling anyone who would listen to him at cocktail hour with stories from the good old, bad old days." [...] MacPhisto sang the closing [...] "Can't Help Falling in Love" [...] with an oddly childlike manner that many reviewers found one of the most poignant moments of the show.|$|E
500|$|When Howard J. Savage of the Carnegie Foundation issued [...] "Bulletin 33" [...] in January 1930 criticizing {{recruitment}} and subsidization of athletes, Aigler challenged {{the fairness of}} the report. Aigler charged that Savage had [...] "no intention of being fair and accurate" [...] and accused Savage of questionable tactics in sending Michigan's president a report of conditions different from the report in the bulletin. Aigler also accused Savage of removing letters from the files of the athletic department to which he was allowed full access. He also argued that the report reflected eastern bias: [...] "In a number of places in the Bulletin the so-called Western Conference (now the Big Nine) is referred to and, curiously, almost always <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of half veiled sneer. The truth apparently is that the Bulletin was written {{from the point of view}} of the Eastern athletic man who has it pretty firmly fixed in mind that, athletically, things are pretty raw in the territory generally West of the Alleghenies." [...] Aigler later issued a 31-page report on athletic conditions at Michigan, charging the Carnegie Foundation with [...] "muck-raking." ...|$|E
500|$|Two years later, on the 20th {{anniversary of}} Jurassic Park, a 3D {{version of the}} film was {{released}} in cinemas. Spielberg declared that he had produced the film <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of [...] "subconscious 3D", as scenes feature animals walking toward the cameras and some effects of foreground and background overlay. In 2011, he stated {{in an interview that}} Jurassic Park was the only of his works he had considered for a conversion, and once he saw the 3D version of Titanic in 2012, he liked the new look of the film so much that he hired the same retrofitting company, Stereo D. Spielberg and cinematographer Janusz Kamiński supervised the nine-month process closely in-between the production of Lincoln. Stereo D executive Aaron Parry declared that the conversion was an evolution of what the company had done with Titanic, [...] "being able to capitalize on everything we learned with Jim on Titanic and take it into a different genre and movie, and one with so many technical achievements." [...] The studio had the help of ILM, which contributed some elements and updated effects shots for a better visual enhancement. It opened in the United States and seven other territories on April 5, 2013, with other countries receiving the re-release in the following six months.|$|E

500|$|Freedom of Speech {{depicts a}} scene of a local town meeting in which Jim Edgerton, the lone {{dissenter}} to the town selectmen's announced {{plans to build a}} new school, was accorded the floor as a matter of protocol. The old school had burned down. Once he envisioned this scene to depict freedom of speech, Rockwell decided to use his Vermont neighbors as models for a Four Freedoms series. The blue-collar speaker wears a plaid shirt and suede jacket. He has dirty hands and a darker complexion than others in attendance. The other attendees are wearing white shirts, ties and jackets. Although one of the men is wearing a wedding band, the speaker is not. Edgerton's youth and workmanlike hands are fashioned with a worn and stained jacket, while the other attendees, appear to be older and more neatly and formally dressed. He is shown [...] "standing tall, his mouth open, his shining eyes transfixed, he speaks his mind, untrammeled and unafraid." [...] Edgerton is depicted in a way that resembles Abraham Lincoln. According to Bruce Cole of The Wall Street Journal, the closest figure in the painting is revealing a subject of the meeting as [...] "a discussion of the town's annual report". According to John Updike, the work is painted without any painterly brushwork. According to Robert Scholes, the work shows audience members in rapt attention <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of admiration of this lone speaker.|$|E
500|$|In addition, he was {{featured}} in a Lipton Tea commercial, which first aired during the broadcast of Super Bowl XXVIII. The advertisement paid tribute to The Three Stooges while satirizing his role in Kung Fu. In 1999, he made an appearance as the demon Tempus in the Season 1 finale episode of Charmed. In 2001, he appeared in the episode [...] "The Serpent" [...] of the syndicated TV series Queen of Swords as the sword-wielding bandit El Serpiente filmed at Texas Hollywood studios in Almeria, Spain, home of many spaghetti westerns. David also did a guest appearance in episode 11 of Lizzie McGuire as himself. David Carradine took over hosting duties from his brother Keith on Wild West Tech on the History Channel, in 2005. The same year he also played both himself and {{the ghost of a}} dead man for an episode of the NBC TV show Medium. By 2006, he had become the spokesperson for Yellowbook, a publisher of independent telephone directories in the United States. He also appeared as the ghost of time, Clockwork, in two episodes of the animated series, Danny Phantom. [...] He also starred in the 2008 TV movie, Kung Fu Killer, in which he played a Chinese martial arts master very similar to his Kung Fu series [...] "Caine" [...] persona—his character in this movie named [...] "White Crane", and mostly referred to or addressed as [...] "Crand," [...] frequently spoken <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of accent that minimized the R sound.|$|E
500|$|Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter {{said that}} the scene where Santana comes out to her {{grandmother}} only to be rejected was a [...] "powerful moment and Rivera delivered in a way equal to Chris Colfer and Mike O'Malley's scenes during Kurt's coming out". Bell also complimented the sequence, though she criticized the next scene for showing [...] "a happy, smiling Santana" [...] with no further explanation, and Canning and Kubicek were also unhappy with her abrupt change in mood, {{as if nothing had}} happened. VanDerWerff, though he called the coming-out scene [...] "a moment that's played <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of bracing honesty and moving empathy" [...] for what Santana was going through, stated that the [...] "Santana storyline {{has been one of the}} best things about the back half of season two and this front half of season three, and the scenes that should be its emotional crux are occurring in our imaginations", such as when she comes out to her parents. Goldberg called the fact that Finn suffered no consequences for his outing of Santana [...] "a missed opportunity". Bell, however, thought that his telling Santana that [...] "he cares about her and doesn't want her to hold her feelings for women in anymore" [...] was [...] "one of the most touching scenes of the series", though Kubicek characterized Finn's statement that he cared for her because Santana [...] "was his first" [...] as creepy. MTV's Kevin P. Sullivan derided the choice to perform [...] "I Kissed a Girl" [...] as [...] "poor comprehension of song lyrics", since Santana [...] "is a lesbian and not just [...] drunk girl who kissed another girl after drinking". VanDerWerff wondered why Santana was so happy during the song, since she had just experienced [...] "the sort of outrageous bigotry she'll have to put up with for the rest of her life".|$|E
