50|$|Tensor {{products}} of Hilbert spaces arise often in quantum mechanics. If some particle <b>is</b> <b>described</b> <b>by</b> the Hilbert space H1, and another particle <b>is</b> <b>described</b> <b>by</b> H2, then the system consisting of both particles <b>is</b> <b>described</b> <b>by</b> the tensor product of H1 and H2. For example, the state {{space of a}} quantum harmonic oscillator is L2(R), so the state space of two oscillators is L2(R) ⊗ L2(R), which is isomorphic to L2(R2). Therefore, the two-particle system <b>is</b> <b>described</b> <b>by</b> wave functions of the form φ(x1, x2). A more intricate example {{is provided by the}} Fock spaces, which describe a variable number of particles.|$|R

40|$|In this dissertation, {{we study}} the {{stability}} of hybrid composite dynamical systems. Such systems are composite systems consisting of a plant which <b>is</b> <b>described</b> <b>by</b> an input-output representation and a controller which <b>is</b> <b>described</b> <b>by</b> a state space representation;The plant <b>is</b> <b>described</b> <b>by</b> an operator (usually a differential equation or a partial differential equation). The controller may be a continuous time system or a discrete time system. In the continuous time case the controller <b>is</b> <b>described</b> <b>by</b> a set of ordinary differential equations, while in the discrete time case the controller <b>is</b> <b>described</b> <b>by</b> a set of difference equations. The latter case is of great importance since modern control systems are often computer controlled systems;We establish results for the well-posedness, attractivity, asymptotic stability in the large and exponential stability in the large for both continuous and discrete time cases. The applicability of our results is demonstrated by examples...|$|R
