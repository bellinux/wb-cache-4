5000|$|Esan land is bordered to {{the south}} by Benin City, to the {{south-east}} by Agbor, {{to the north and}} east by Etsako, to the west by River Niger. From Ewu to Benin City, the State capital, is 100 km long. No accurate demographic data of the people is available and the various local governments in Esan appear to lack reliable information in this direction. The people populate areas such as Uromi, Ewohimi, Ewatto, Igueben, Irrua, Ubiaja, Ogwa, Ebelle, Ekpon, Ewossa and Amahor, Ekpoma, Ohordua and Ewu in central Edo State, South-South Nigeria. It has a flat landscape, lacking in rocks and mountains, and good for agricultural purpose. The topography of Esanland Ekpon plateau starts its rise from Ekpon and into six miles slope to Ewohimi, creating [...] "Ekpon mini Plateau" [...] Ekpon is the gateway to Esanland, South East and the first of Esanland Kingdom therein as a border town, where centuries contacts with neighbors south in the Niger Delta, have influenced its Esan dialects by its earlier contacts through subsistence agriculture with the Ika speaking people of Igbanke, Oligie Igbodo etc. While in terms of human geography the people of Ekpon speaks mostly corrupted Ika dialect, they are nevertheless, culturally and traditionally Esan. As could be empirically evidence, most boarder towns in modern Nigeria are in the same situation as Ekpon.Geographically, Esanland is on a plateau, surrounded by slopes would be noticed from a start point at Ekpon, down to the lower Niger river, the valley and wetland towards Etsako, the Kukuruku Hills and the plain around Benin city the state capital. The tableland though reddish-brown in colour, is a fertile land for farming, which is the main occupation of the Esan people. There is a dense thick forest, nutritionally rich in economic crops and herbal plants. However, it is suffering from bush burning, and <b>wood</b> <b>felling</b> for timber and as a major source of fuel (which is in high demand) for the increasing population of the Esan people.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{the paper}} is to present a dynamic {{mathematical}} model developed for assessing the potential greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and economic impact associated with bio-resources from agricultural and forestry wastes. Agriculture is directly associated with climate change issues on environmental, economic and social dimensions. Agricultural activities emit greenhouse gases that, on their turn, influence the agricultural productivity. A part of the agricultural GHG emissions arises from crop production, crop residue decomposition and burning. Conversely, forests work as removers of the GHG emissions from the atmosphere. However, the increasing <b>wood</b> <b>felling</b> generates forestry waste that gradually decomposes, thus also generating emissions. To avoid these emissions and to gain an added value, the agricultural and forestry wastes {{can be turned into}} valuable resource. In this study, a mathematical model is developedfor the simulation of the interaction between agricultural and forestry activities, generated waste and their efficient use andGHG emissions. Several scenarios are developed where application of the waste as a resource for fuel is assessed with respect to environmental and economic aspects. We build a model where system dynamics modeling approach is used. The results show the fuel energycan potentially be generated from agricultural and forestry residues and how net GHG emissions change depending on the selected amount of removed waste materials...|$|E
40|$|Approximately 127 {{million tonnes}} of waste and {{comparable}} by-products were generated in Finland in 2000. Of this total amount, the largest quantities are surplus soil from construction (34 million tones), wall rock, ore dressing sand and other soil material from {{mining and quarrying}} (26 million tones in all), straw and manure from agriculture (25 million tonnes) and <b>wood</b> <b>felling</b> waste from forestry (20 million tonnes). Altogether nearly 17 million tones of waste were generated in manufacturing in 2000, of which the largest quantities were waste wood and bark, slag from the basic metal industry, especially gypsum, and liquid wastes from the food industry. The annual volume of solid municipal waste amounted to 2. 6 million tones. Smaller amounts than those listed above were generated as ash and slag from energy production, construction materials from new building and demolition and as sludge from waste water treatment. On average, 40 per cent of all the generated waste are recovered by the national economy as a whole. In thems of volume this represents approximately 50 million tones. Wastes like surplus soils from construction, as well as manure and straw, were recovered in large volumes.

40|$|As one of {{the most}} {{important}} renewable and sustainable energy sources, the forest biomass energy resource has always been the focus of attention of scholars and policy makers. However, its potential is still uncertain in China, especially with respect to its spatial distribution. In this paper, the quantity and distribution of Chinese forest biomass energy resources are explored based mainly on forestry statistics data rather than forest resource inventory data used by most previous studies. The results show that the forest biomass energy resource in China was 169 million tons in 2010, of which <b>wood</b> <b>felling</b> and bucking residue (WFBR),wood processing residue (WPR), bamboo processing residue, fuel wood and firewood used by farmers accounted for 38 %, 37 %, 6 %, 4 % and 15 %, respectively. The highest resource was located in East China, accounting for nearly 39. 0 % of the national amount, followed by the Southwest and South China regions, which accounted for 17. 4 % and 16. 3 %, respectively. At the provincial scale, Shandong has the highest distribution, accounting for 11. 9 % of total resources, followed by Guangxi and Fujian accounting for 10. 3 % and 10. 2 %, respectively. The actual wood-processing residue (AWPR) estimated from the actual production of different wood products (considering the wood transferred between regions) showed apparent differences from the local wood processing residue (LWPR), which assumes that no wood has been transferredbetween regions. Due to the large contribution of WPR to total forestry bioenergy resources, the estimation of AWPR will provide a more accurate evaluation of the total amount and the spatial distribution of forest biomass energy resources in China...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} the archaeobotanical study (micro-remains: pollen and ferns spores, macro-remains: seeds, fruits, woods and charcoals) of six sites located {{in the city of}} Venice and two in the {{surrounding}} lagoon. The eight sites were investigated starting from 2000 {{under the direction of the}} Soprintendenza per i Beni Archeologici del Veneto-NAUSICAA and are mostly of Medieval age, with some occupation phases in the pre-Roman age, the Roman period, the Renaissance and the post-Renaissance age. The present work represents the first systematic archaeobotanical study which was ever carried out in the town of Venice. All the phases of the analysis have been undertaken according to the current international standards. As a whole, the analysis has involved the study of 106 pollen samples, 9 seeds/fruits and wood/charcoal samples obtained by sieving and 59 wooden artefacts. The samples come from the following sites: A) City of Venice (74 samples) : 1) Piazza San Marco: 17 pollen samples (8 of Medieval age and 9 of the Renaissance period); 2) Cà Vendramin Calergi- Casinò Municipale: 12 pollen samples (8 of Medieval age and 4 of the Renaissance period); 3) Cà Foscari: 12 pollen samples (10 of the Late Roman Age and 5 of Medieval age); 4) Palazzo Carminati: 10 pollen samples (all of which of Medieval age); 5) Palazzo Genovese: 12 pollen samples (8 of the Late Roman Age, 3 of Medieval age and 1 of the Renaissance period); 6) Arsenale: 8 pollen samples (4 of Medieval age, 2 of the Renaissance period and 2 of an uncertain chronology); B) North-eastern lagoon (32 samples) : 7) Cà Ballarin: 10 pollen samples (3 pre-Roman, 5 Roman, 2 Late Roman Age) and 8) Lazzaretto vecchio: 22 pollen samples (7 Medieval period, 11 Renaissance, 4 post-Renaissance). All the samples have undergone the routine treatments. The preservation state of most finds (pollens, seeds/fruits, woods/charcoals) is good/excellent. The list of plants is very rich: 375 taxa have been identified, ca. 90 of which belong to wooden plants; 230 are herbs and 15 pteridophytes. The archaeobotanical data obtained have allowed the evolution of the vegetal and cultural landscape of Venice to be reconstructed from the origin to the Modern period: in the pre-Roman period the area is scantly populated; a wide lagoon is present with some large sandbanks and areas covered with meso-hygrophilous oakwoods and hygrophilous alder forests. During the Roman age the anthropic pressure becomes intense, with <b>wood</b> <b>felling</b> and a substantial increase in agricultural activities; in the Late Roman period the area appears more forested and dominated by extensive oakwoods and hygrophilous forests with a decrease of anthropic activities. In the Medieval age the landscape goes through further changes: it becomes more open, wooden free, with a high anthropic pressure and a good economy (commercial trade, a rich and varied diet, etc.) as it is testified by the presence of numerous botanical finds and exotic species. This trend will continue in the Renaissance period until the beginning of the Modern age, with several finds which give evidence of the refined tastes and the richness of the Venice society...|$|E
