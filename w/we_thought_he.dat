Just the way he always carried himself, just very smart, intelligent, classy. Easy-moving horse, kind of scopey and light, but in a good way — just an athlete... We've got a stallion barn that we want to fill. He was the kind that had enough of the attributes on paper, that if he did what <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> could do, he'd be in our stallion barn. And he hasn't proven us wrong yet." ...|$|E

"There {{are some}} stories, {{especially}} ones {{that occur in}} the bedroom, where mainstream media outlets sometimes can’t venture—or at least they can’t find it in themselves to lead the charge.

[...] (Even in his confession, Mr. Edwards wrinkled his nose and suggested that the allegations had originated with [...] "supermarket tabloids", as if the method of conveyance absolved him of the deeds described.) ...|$|E

2500|$|He {{received}} scholarship {{offers from}} Michigan State, USC, Tennessee, Florida, and Iowa. Ringer was also heavily recruited by Ohio State, {{but did not}} receive a scholarship offer from the school. Ohio State coach Jim Tressel said “(We) were very interested. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was a great player.” One article said the reason why Ringer wasn't given an offer is because OSU compared Ringer to Ryan Brewer, a high school standout from Troy, Ohio who OSU passed on. Brewer had a solid college career at South Carolina for Coach Lou Holtz and helped the Gamecocks beat Ohio State in the 2001 Outback Bowl. Ringer attended summer football camps at Ohio State during high school. One of them was 2004's NIKE Camp in Columbus, Ohio. During that camp, Ringer had a camp best shuttle run of a 3.87 seconds.

2500|$|At the 'Bloody Angle,' Spotsylvania, May 12th, our corps, the Sixth, {{supported}} the Second {{in the famous}} charge against [...] Johnson's Division of the Confederate Army. During the thickest of the fight, Lieutenant Wellman was badly wounded, and I was ordered {{to take him to}} the rear. It was about a mile to the hospital, and the shot and shell came so thick and fast that it was extremely hazardous to venture across with a wounded comrade, but I succeeded in carrying out the order, and after placing the lieutenant in the hospital, I came safely back through the fire. Upon reaching my company, Lieutenant Sparks congratulated me, saying: ' Tracy, I hope you will not have to cross that field on a like errand again.' Scarcely had he finished speaking, when a ball pierced his left breast and he fell into my arms. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was mortally wounded, but discovering signs of life in him, decided {{to take him to the}} hospital, without waiting for orders.|$|E

And my attitude was, I'd rather pay Ken Shamrock to not fight. I'd rather pay him to not fight and just say, [...] "stay home, Ken". Ken is way past his prime, {{it gets to the}} point where it's dangerous for that guy to still be fighting." [...] WWE announcer Jim Ross said before Shamrock's scheduled fight with Bobby Lashley in early 2009; [...] "There was a time that I could see the veteran, 45-year-old Shamrock, a former WWE superstar, schooling the MMA rookie Lashley but that ship has long since sailed. I have great respect for Ken but he's outstayed his welcome in the octagon, cage, whatever and needs to teach and coach and stop fighting...Kenny is fighting for one more pay day while Lashley is fighting to help establish what he hopes will be a long term, lucrative, MMA career." ...|$|E

2500|$|The 79th {{running of}} the Tokyo Yushun took place over 2400 metres on firm ground at Tokyo on 27 May. World Ace headed the betting from Gold Ship with Deep Brillante third choice on 7.5/1. The other runners {{included}} Grandezza, Just A Way, Alfredo, Fenomeno and Historical (Mainichi Hai Stakes). In the build-up to the race the colt's groom had praised his attitude and temperament saying [...] "He's so calm usually it's almost frightening. He doesn't need any babysitting whatsoever. He's an intelligent horse, and he always runs his heart out in races". After tracking the leaders Iwata sent the colt into third approaching the final turn before taking the lead 200 metres out. In an extremely tight finish Deep Brillante held on to win by a nose from Fenomeno, with Tosen Homareboshi, World Ace, Gold Ship and Cosmo Ozora close behind. Less than two lengths covered the first six finishers. After the race Iwata, who was winning {{the race for the}} first time, said [...] "Praise him not me. It was his guts that won it as he was completely empty at the finish. I have always thought he was the best horse in this generation so we trained him very hard to get a big success. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was the best one and I am proud that we could prove it." ...|$|E
2500|$|David Flying Hawk was {{the eldest}} son of Felix Flying Hawk. David was a {{performer}} with Wild West Shows and traveled with his grandfather Chief Flying Hawk. In 1924, David Flying Hawk performed in Rhode Island and had a notable encounter with a horse named “King Tut.” [...] “King Tut was a big bay, very rank horse, that we bought at Tribune, Kansas. [...] The real King Tut’s tomb had been discovered along about this time and papers were still carrying {{quite a bit of}} news about it, therefore the name King Tut. [...] The horse had been bucked away from a snubbing horse a few times and <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> would develop; into a real good, tough bucking horse. [...] A lot of the credit for getting ole Tut started on the road to becoming a great horse must go to a Sioux Indian boy by the name of Dave Flying Hawk, who was on the Knights of Columbus rodeo with us in 1924. [...] This Indian and two others, of the carload that was with us, were bronc riders. [...] Dave was also part of the Indian dance troupe. The program for our opening performance in Providence, Rhode Island was somewhat in turmoil. [...] The Indian dancers had just finished when the arena director, Sammy Garrett, started calling for Flying Hawk to come to the bucking chutes, that his horse was in. [...] King Tut, being pretty wild. Had gone into the chutes first. [...] There being no time for Flying Hawk to change clothes, he came to the chutes in full dance costume—fringed buckskin clothes, feathers, bells—the whole works. [...] While the chute help saddled the big wild King Tut, who hadn’t been to town any more than the Indian had, Flying Hawk put on someone's boots and spurs and eased up over the chute and down onto Tut’s back. [...] When they opened the chute gate and those bells started ringing and those feathers started flopping, that horse went completely berserk. [...] The kid weathered the storm for about five jumps before he went into orbit. [...] It looked as though someone had shot a wild turkey—the crowd went wild. [...] They thought that it was a special act that Flying Hawk was putting on. [...] That was the funniest thong I’ve ever seen happened at a rodeo. [...] We sold King Tut, along with four or five top horses, to McCarty and Elliott of Cheyenne the next year. [...] I heard {{a few years ago that}} they bucked him until he was nearly twenty-six years old, but I’m sure that he was never as scared in his life as we was with Flying Hawk on board.” ...|$|E

60|$|I {{could never}} {{make out what}} his age could be, nor could Jim Horscroft either. Sometimes <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> was an oldish man that looked young, and at others {{that he was a}} youngish man who looked old. His brown, stiff, {{close-cropped}} hair needed no cropping at the top, where it thinned away to a shining curve. His skin too was intersected by a thousand fine wrinkles, lacing and interlacing, and was all burned, as I have already said, by the sun. Yet he was as lithe as a boy, and he was as tough as whalebone, walking all day over the hills or rowing on the sea without turning a hair. On the whole <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> might be about forty or forty-five, though {{it was hard to see}} how he could have seen so much of life in the time. But one day we got talking of ages, and then he surprised us.|$|R

60|$|We {{sent for}} the doctor, {{but he could}} not do {{anything}} really. It had been a death-blow, though the illness lasted a full week. He knew us generally, and liked to see us, but he always had the sense that something dreadful had happened to us; and he would stroke my hand or Jaquetta's, and pity us. He was haunted, too, by the sense that he ought to do something for us which he could not do. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> meant to make a will, securing us something, but he was never in a condition in which my brother would have felt justified in getting him to sign it. Indeed there was so little disease about him, and <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> would get better, if only we could keep him free from distress and excitement; so we made his room as quiet as possible, and discouraged his talking or thinking.|$|E
