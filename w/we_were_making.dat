5|$|Shooting on Edge of Darkness {{began on}} 9 July 1984 {{and ran for}} five months until 5 December 1984. Location filming took place in London (including the Barbican Arts Centre, BBC Television Centre and the Hilton International Kensington), Yorkshire (including the {{headquarters}} of the West Yorkshire Police in Bradford, the Middleton Railway, the headquarters of Systime Computers (now the O2 building) in Leeds where Craven hacks into the MI5 computer and at Westwood Cottage, Ilkley for Craven's home), Scotland (including the Gleneagles Hotel, where Jedburgh addresses the NATO conference and also where President Reagan's Reykjavík policy was formulated) and Wales (including Clogau Gold Mine and Manod, Blaenau Ffestiniog doubling as Northmoor with the hot cell a set constructed at a factory in Penygroes). Throughout the entire shoot, the production continued to be known as Magnox; the title Dark Forces was briefly considered before the serial was renamed Edge of Darkness in April 1985. As the shoot progressed it became apparent to the cast and crew that they had a potential hit on their hands; Bob Peck recalled, “I think we knew when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>making</b> it {{that it was a good}} piece of work” while Kennedy Martin told reporters “I haven't had this feeling about something for 20 years. It's wonderful, after all this time, to get something that actually works”.|$|E

25|$|The {{band was}} a lot of fun. I think there was great rapport between the people in it. And none of us wanted to leave. We were always getting sort of offers from other bands for much more money than <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>making</b> with Woody, and it was always like if you left, you were a rat. You were really letting down the team.|$|E

25|$|I {{just want}} to say that when I was 16 or 17 years old, I went to see Buddy Holly play at Duluth National Guard Armory and I was three feet away from him… and he looked at me. And I just have some kind of feeling that he was – I don’t know how or why – but I know he was with us all the time <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>making</b> this record in some kind of way.|$|E
25|$|Into the '60s, I {{was still}} not of a frame of mind {{that we were not}} only making music, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>making</b> history. But I did {{recognize}} the impact because acts were going all over the world at that time. I recognized the bridges that we crossed, the racial problems and the barriers that we broke down with music. I recognized that because I lived it. I would come to the South {{in the early days of}} Motown and the audiences would be segregated. Then they started to get the Motown music and we would go back and the audiences were integrated and the kids were dancing together and holding hands.|$|E
500|$|Alistair Taylor (Epstein's assistant) later {{admitted}} that financial mistakes were made: [...] "We did our best; {{some people have}} said it wasn't good enough. That's easy to say with 20/20 hindsight but remember {{that there were no}} rules. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>making</b> it up as we went along." ...|$|E

Director Rob Bowman was concerned with [...] "Q Who" [...] for a while, saying that [...] "we didn't know day to day if <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>making</b> a stinker or a winner".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with MusicRadar, Delson stated that the album would feature more guitar solos. He further stated that [...] "this is from someone who was quoted early on as saying I hated them. Not that I hated them as a listener; I just don’t want to play any; I shirked guitar solos. Early on, I felt as though the songs <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>making</b> aesthetically didn't want them. This new batch of songs, to me, always want solos. I feel like every song has one." ...|$|E
500|$|His {{performance}} {{earned him}} another Best Actor Academy Award nomination, 17 {{years after his}} first. Reviews were strong, and the film {{is considered one of}} the best of his later career. In Day, he found a co-star with whom he could build a rapport, such as he had had with Blondell at the start of his career. Day herself was full of praise for Cagney, stating that he was [...] "the most professional actor I've ever known. He was always 'real'. I simply forgot <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>making</b> a picture. His eyes would actually fill up when we were working on a tender scene. And you never needed drops to make your eyes shine when Jimmy was on the set." ...|$|E

500|$|To {{promote the}} album in Europe, Kiedis and Frusciante both agreed {{they would make}} the trip. However, it proved {{difficult}} for Frusciante to adapt to life outside of the mansion, after being in near-seclusion for almost 30 days. Kiedis recalled of the situation: [...] "He had such an outpouring of creativity while <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>making</b> that album that I think he really didn't know how to live life in tandem with that creativity." [...] It was also during this period when Frusciante began to experiment with heroin, which further compromised his mental stability. The European promotional trek took its toll on Frusciante, {{and he decided to}} return home when he and Kiedis reached London.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} Monsters, Inc. was {{conceived}} in a lunch in 1994 attended by John Lasseter, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft during {{the production of}} Toy Story. One of the ideas {{that came out of}} the brainstorming session was a film about monsters. [...] "When <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>making</b> Toy Story", Docter said, [...] "everybody came up to me and said 'Hey, I totally believed that my toys came to life when I left the room.' So when Disney asked us to do some more films, I wanted to tap into a childlike notion that was similar to that. I knew monsters were coming out of my closet when I was a kid. So I said, 'Hey, let's do a film about monsters.|$|E
500|$|... was {{in trouble}} at that time {{because she had a}} couple of engagements that she didn't keep up. But what people didn't realise at that time, that she really knew, and in fact I didn't even know it when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>making</b> the record, and now looking at the whole thing; she knew that she was in a lot of trouble; that she wasn't going to live. And it wasn't drugs. It was alcohol toward the end... It was such a sad thing because... she was the only singer that really sang what I call the 'right way' because she was a great jazz-pop singer... She was really a great jazz singer. A true jazz singer. And I regret that because that's the 'right way' to sing.|$|E

500|$|An {{interview}} with actress Kristin Chenoweth, who was originally cast as Rapunzel, reveals {{that at some}} point Rapunzel was intended to be a squirrel. As directors, Greno and Howard felt it essential that Rapunzel resemble a less [...] "passive" [...] heroine than the way she is depicted in the original fairy tale. [...] "We knew <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>making</b> this movie for a contemporary audience and we wanted Rapunzel to be a real role model in a way. We wanted all this girl power and to really drive this story, so she doesn't wait around for anything ... she's a smart girl, she has these hopes and dreams and she's going to get what she wants out of life." [...] Tangleds production was surrounded by rumors that it would be Disney's last princess film.|$|E
500|$|Ruck {{says that}} with Cameron Frye, Hughes gave him [...] "the best part I {{ever had in}} a movie, and any success that I've had since 1985 is because he took a big chance on me. I'll be forever grateful." [...] "While <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>making</b> the movie, I just knew I {{had a really good}} part", Ruck says. [...] "My {{realization}} of John's impact on the teen-comedy genre crept in sometime later. Teen comedies tend to dwell on the ridiculous, as a rule. It's always the preoccupation with sex and the self-involvement, and we kind of hold the kids up for ridicule in a way. Hughes added this element of dignity. He was an advocate for teenagers as complete human beings, and he honored their hopes and their dreams. That's what you see in his movies." ...|$|E
500|$|Shooting {{commenced}} {{in early}} November and concluded on November 27, 2007. The strike suspended {{the script for}} the next episode and freed {{the cast and crew}} from an immediate deadline, with the result that more time was spent on filming [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] than the average Lost episode. Shooting did not customarily overlap with the surrounding episodes, although it was produced simultaneously with the [...] mobisodes directed by executive producer Jack Bender and one scene from the season premiere overseen by co-executive producer Jean Higgins. Perrineau hoped the audience would enjoy Michael's return since the cast and crew [...] "busted [...] butts doing this one. It felt like <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>making</b> a movie because there's so much stuff that happens in this episode". Lilly called it [...] "one of the best episodes of the first eight." ...|$|E

500|$|... and {{stationed}} it in a 5,000-square-foot rented house. Cory Edwards {{traveled to}} this studio {{a total of}} fifteen times {{over the course of}} the film's three-year production and has explained that although the house was located in an expensive part of Manila, the rent was no more than that of his two-bedroom apartment in Los Angeles. When Cory was not able to be on site, Todd took over directing duties. [...] "Along with Tony, we were kind of a 'three headed monster,'" [...] Cory explains. [...] "We all knew what movie <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>making,</b> and I trusted those guys to make creative calls when I couldn't be there." [...] Lovegren had attempted to start an independent animation studio in the Philippines before in 2001, but the studio, called ImagineAsia, was closed after it failed to attract business. Digital Eyecandy hired approximately twenty animators that had previously been employed by ImagineAsia ...|$|E
500|$|The Masked Avengers {{received}} a sudden burst of fame from the prank. They gave more than 300 interviews about the conversation, and were even flown to New York City by CBS {{to appear on}} The Early Show. In an interview, Marc-Antoine Audette and Sébastien Trudel said that they found it [...] "pretty disturbing to see that idiots like us can go through to a vice-presidential candidate", and claimed {{that they were just}} [...] "two stupid comedians with a bad French accent." [...] The Masked Avengers also admitted that the call was [...] "probably the biggest [...] we've ever done." [...] When recalling the experience, Audette said that [...] "once we [...] started making jokes, she didn't seem to mind, and she didn't seem {{to be aware of the}} fact <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>making</b> jokes", which according to Audette was when [...] "we were like 'Oh my God this [...] is gonna be long'". The duo also said that they weren't trying to make any political statements with the call, they just like to take high-profile people to task.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Murphy commented {{on the structure of}} the series' first season. [...] "I loved how it began. I loved it in the middle and I loved the end. The only thing really frustrating for me, to be honest with you, is that sometimes people would write this idea that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>making</b> it up as we went along and I wanted to say, 'Really?' But I think now people are writing and saying, 'Oh yeah!' I'm excited for people to see it on DVD, because now that they know how it ended, [...] go back and see all of the little things, like people who have no reflections in mirrors. When you go back, you will see everything was set up." [...] When asked if the House [...] "pulled" [...] the Harmons to it, Murphy responded, [...] "I don't know if they were targeted. I don't think the Internet site had any supernatural pull to it...although that would have been hilarious. I thought it was two things: it was house porn because I think that house really is extraordinary. And also I think there's always that allure in American lives of the fresh start, moving West, starting fresh." ...|$|E
