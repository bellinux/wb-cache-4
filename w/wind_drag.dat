2500|$|On October 28, 2015, {{one of two}} JLENS aerostats {{being used}} to conduct a test over Aberdeen Proving Ground in Aberdeen, Maryland, became untethered. It was escorted by two fighter jets as it drifted at an {{altitude}} of approximately 16,000 feet towards Pennsylvania. About three hours later, it was reported by NORAD to be approaching the ground near Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania, about 100 miles north of Aberdeen. Its dragging [...] tether reportedly downed many power lines in the area, with loss of electrical power to as many as 20,000 area residents. The Pennsylvania State Police reported less than an hour later that the aerostat was [...] "contained". It was found tangled in trees in Anthony Township, Pennsylvania. The Pentagon suspended trials of the system after the incident until the Army completed its investigation of how the aerostat broke free. The program was said to be [...] "hanging by a thread" [...] after the incident. By February 2016, the investigation had found that a malfunctioning pressure sensing device caused a loss of air pressure in the tail fins, leading to the loss of aerodynamic efficiency which, along with increased <b>wind</b> <b>drag,</b> exacerbated tension on the tether to the point of breakage. [...] Following the incident, the military initially decided that the JLENS should continue with its operational exercise because of the unique cruise-missile defense capability it provides, determining that changes and procedures will enable it to safely fly again.|$|E

50|$|Propagation is {{affected}} by time of day. During the daytime the solar wind presses this layer closer to the Earth, thereby limiting how far it can reflect radio waves. Conversely, on the night (lee) side of the Earth, the solar <b>wind</b> <b>drags</b> the ionosphere further away, thereby greatly increasing the range which radio waves can travel by reflection, called skywave. The extent of the effect is further influenced by the season, {{and the amount of}} sunspot activity.|$|R

30|$|The {{response}} to the northward (southward) wind is expected because the northward (southward) wind induces decreasing TEC in the northern (southern) hemisphere. This is because the northward (southward) <b>wind</b> <b>drags</b> the plasma away from the southern (northern) hemisphere along the trough across the dip equator to the other hemisphere. The plasma is then forced to lower altitude by the neutral wind and by the Earth’s gravitational force. Since there is no solar input to generate photoionization at night, the plasma that reaches lower altitude thus decreases in content due to the high recombination rate.|$|R

50|$|The National Weather Service posted flood watches {{stretching}} from Dallas, Texas, to Scranton, Pennsylvania, starting March 16.

The northern low, combined with strong upper level <b>winds,</b> <b>dragged</b> large amounts moisture north from the Gulf of Mexico. The southern low produced severe weather and heavy rain on its north side. At one point, the national weather radar composite showed a large shield of heavy rain {{stretching from}} Texas to northern Indiana. River flooding continued through May in some areas, causing additional problems where flash flooding from the heavy rains struck. Numerous locations in Arkansas reported record rainfall totals from March into early April.|$|R

50|$|It was {{postulated}} that small rafts of ice form around {{the rocks and}} the rocks are buoyantly floated off the soft bed, thus reducing the reaction and friction forces at the bed. Since this effect depends on reducing friction, and not on increasing the <b>wind</b> <b>drag,</b> these ice cakes need not have a particularly large surface area if the ice is adequately thick, as the minimal friction allows the rocks to be moved by arbitrarily light winds.|$|E

40|$|Spacecraft {{observations}} {{have established}} {{that all of}} the terrestrial planets interact strongly with the solar wind and possess well developed magnetic tails. At Mercury, Earth, and possibly Mars the tail forms {{as a result of the}} solar <b>wind</b> <b>dragging</b> back field lines intrinsic to the planet. Venus differs dramatically from the other planets in that its magnetotail is composed of interplanetary field lines draped about the ionopause. Accordingly, the observations made at the terrestrial planets provide an opportunity to compare not only induced (Venus) magnetic tail properties with those of intrinsic field tails, but also the variation among intrinsic field tails ion the limits of no ionosphere (Mercury), weak intrinsic magnetic field (Mars), and strong magnetic field and ionosphere (Earth). A comparative investigation is made of terrestrial planet magnetotail structure and dynamics. The results are discussed in terms of the physical properties of these planets and their interactions with the solar wind...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{surveys of}} marine plastic debris density have {{revealed}} high {{levels in the}} center of the subtropical gyres. Earlier studies have argued that the formation of great garbage patches is due to Ekman convergence in such regions. In this work we report a tendency so far overlooked of drogued and undrogued drifters to accumulate distinctly over the subtropical gyres, with undrogued drifters accumulating in the same areas where plastic debris accumulate. We show that the observed accumulation is too fast for Ekman convergence to explain it. We demonstrate that the accumulation is controlled by finite-size and buoyancy (i. e., inertial) effects on undrogued drifter motion subjected to ocean current and <b>wind</b> <b>drags.</b> We infer that the motion of flotsam in general is constrained by similar effects. This is done by using a newly proposed Maxey [...] Riley equation which models the submerged (surfaced) drifter portion as a sphere of the fractional volume that is submerged (surfaced).

40|$|Almost 4 billion {{kilometers}} from the Sun, Pioneer 10 's findings paint a detailed picture of the solar atmosphere. The heliosphere is now {{believed to be a}} huge magnetic bubble created by the solar wind and gets its tear-shape from streamlining due to the motion of the solar system through the interstellar gas. The skin of the bubble, the region between stellar and interstellar gas, is believed to lie between 50 and 100 AU from the Sun. The solar <b>wind</b> <b>drags</b> the Sun's magnetic field with it. The bubble, probably extends far beyond Pluto, and is believed to breathe, expanding and contracting like a giant cosmic lung with each 11 year cycle. The most recent findings show that as storms on the Sun build up toward maximum solar activity, they send out shock waves throughout the bubble which cause ripples. This long lived solar storm turbulence accelerates low energy cosmic ray particles coming in from the galaxy, deflecting them out of the solar system, and shielding the planets. As distance from the Sun increases, more and more cosmic ray particles penetrate the heliosphere...|$|R
50|$|The complex {{motions of}} orbits {{can be broken}} down. The {{hypothetical}} motion that the body follows under the gravitational effect of one other body only is typically a conic section, and can be readily modeled with the methods of geometry. This is called a two-body problem, or an unperturbed Keplerian orbit. The differences between the Keplerian orbit and the actual motion of the body are caused by perturbations. These perturbations are caused by forces other than the gravitational effect between the primary and secondary body and must be modeled to create an accurate orbit simulation. Most orbit modeling approaches model the two-body problem and then add models of these perturbing forces and simulate these models over time. Perturbing forces may include gravitational attraction from other bodies besides the primary, solar <b>wind,</b> <b>drag,</b> magnetic fields, and propulsive forces.|$|E
5000|$|Many modular helmets are {{designed}} to be worn only in the closed position for riding, as the movable chin bar is designed as a convenience feature, useful while not actively riding. The curved shape of an open chin bar and face shield section can cause increased <b>wind</b> <b>drag</b> during riding, as air will not flow around an open modular helmet {{in the same way as}} a three-quarters helmet. Since the chin bar section also protrudes further from the forehead than a three-quarters visor, riding with the helmet in the open position may pose increased risk of neck injury in a crash. Some modular helmets are dual certified as full face and open face helmet. The chin bar of those helmets offer real protection and they can be used in the [...] "open" [...] position while riding. An example of such a helmet would be the Shark Evoline.|$|E
50|$|Semi-{{aerodynamic}} and aerodynamic wheelsets {{are characterized}} by greater rim depth, which is the radial distance between the outermost and the innermost surfaces of the rim; a triangular or pyramidal cross-section; and by fewer numbers of spokes, or no spokes at all—with blades molded of composite material supporting the rim. The spokes are also often flattened in the rotational direction to reduce <b>wind</b> <b>drag.</b> These are called bladed spokes. However, semi-aerodynamic and aerodynamic wheelsets tend to be heavier than more traditional spoked wheelsets due to the extra shapings of the rims and spokes. More importantly, the rims must be heavier when there are fewer spokes, as the unsupported span between spokes is greater. A number of wheel manufacturers are now producing wheels with roughly half the spokes of the highest performance traditional wheel from the 1980s, with approximately the same rotational inertia and less total weight. These improvements have been made possible primarily through improved aluminium alloys for the rims.|$|E
40|$|In part I, {{using an}} {{effective}} computational approach, we have reconstructed {{the population of}} dust sources between Jupiter and Neptune. Here, in part II, we present the results on distribution of dust produced by 157 real sources (100 Jupiter-family comets with semi-major axes a < 20 AU, 51 Kuiper belt, and 6 Centaur objects) as well as 211 fictitious sources taken from our computed sample. The following processes that influence the dust particle dynamics are taken into account: 1) gravitational scattering on four giant planets; 2) planetary resonances; and 3) the Poynting-Robertson (P-R) and solar <b>wind</b> <b>drags.</b> A file consisting of 0. 9 × 106 particle positions has been computed to simulate the dust distribution in the outer parts of the Solar system.

40|$|Water {{interacts with}} soil through pore {{channels}} putting mineral constituents and pollutants into solution. The irregularity of pore boundaries and {{the heterogeneity of}} distribution of soil minerals and contaminants are, among others, two factors influencing that interaction and, consequently, the leaching of chemicals and the dispersion of solute throughout the soil. This paper deals with the interaction of irregular <b>winding</b> <b>dragging</b> paths through soil complex distributions. A mathematical modelling of the interplay between multifractal distributions of mineral/pollutants in soil and fractal pore networks is presented. A Ho¨lder path {{is used as a}} model of soil pore network and a multifractal measure as a model of soil complex distribution, obtaining a mathematical result which shows that the Ho¨lder exponent of the path and the entropy dimension of the distribution may be used to quantify such interplay. Practical interpretation and potential applications of the above result in the context of soil are discussed. Since estimates of the value of both parameters can be obtained from field and laboratory data, hopefully this mathematical modelling might prove useful in the study of solute dispersion processes in soil...|$|R
40|$|Spherical {{harmonic}} {{representations of}} the geomagnetic field based on ground-based and low-altitude spacecraft measurements adequately describe the field within several earth radii of the earth's surface. As the internal field decreases with increasing distance from the earth, external field sources become relatively more important. In the region of 3 to 6 earth radii, magnetospheric plasma inflates the field lines and decreases the field strength by an amount which is typically 10 's of gammas and occasionally 100 's of gammas. At greater distances on the day side of the earth, the solar wind compresses the field and produces equatorial field strengths of approximately 60 gammas at 10 earth radii. Field lines near the magnetopause intersect the earth at approximately 78 deg latitude in the sunward hemisphere. The solar <b>wind</b> <b>drags</b> high latitude field lines away from the earth in the night hemisphere forming the geomagnetic tail and neutral sheet. Asymmetric field inflation in the magnetosphere occurs during magnetic disturbances with the largest effects concentrated in the evening quadrant. The tail configuration can deviate substantially from the average configuration during magnetic disturbances...|$|R
