5|$|The book {{attracted}} academic interest, {{and scholars}} discussed it {{in at least}} three distinct categories: language and style, often in relation to the politics of totalitarianism; trauma studies, given the psychological pressure on the novel's characters, <b>who</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> under a totalitarian regime; and ethnographic and literary studies of the German minority in Romania. On the latter topic, Valentina Glajar, now at Texas State University, published an article in 1997. Müller's Herztier is one of the four titles discussed in Glajar's 2004 monograph The German Legacy, on German-language literature from Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|Family {{issues were}} {{significant}} concerns for lesbians when gay activism became more vocal in the 1960s and 1970s. Custody issues in particular were of interest since often courts would not award custody to mothers who were openly homosexual, {{even though the}} general procedure acknowledged children were awarded to the biological mother. Several studies performed {{as a result of}} custody disputes viewed how children grow up with same-sex parents compared to single mothers who did not identify as lesbians. They found that children's mental health, happiness, and overall adjustment is similar to children of divorced women who are not lesbians. Sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex roles of children <b>who</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> with lesbian mothers are unaffected. Differences that were found include the fact that divorced lesbians tend to be living with a partner, fathers visit divorced lesbian mothers more often than divorced nonlesbian mothers, and lesbian mothers report a greater fear of losing their children through legal means.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{the present}} study was to examine whether women who were {{abandoned}} by their father experience more anxious, preventive and reactive jealousy than women <b>who</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> in the presence of their father. The sample consisted of 186 female undergraduate students from Curacao (age M = 22. 88; SD = 5. 68) who were categorized into two groups: women <b>who</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> without their father and women <b>who</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> in the presence of their father. We found that women who were abandoned by their father reported significantly more anxious and preventive jealousy than women <b>who</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> in the presence of their father. There were no significant differences between these two groups in reactive jealousy. Possible explanations are discussed in light of the potential function of jealousy for females <b>who</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> without a father. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|This {{exploratory}} study compared selected HIV/STD-related risk variables (sexual behavior, condom use, STD diagnosis, and beliefs) between adults <b>who</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> {{in a rural}} area and those <b>who</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> in a non-rural area. Participants were recruited through an electronic mailing list of a large, internet-based sexual enhancement product company and completed a web-based questionnaire. A sample comprising 123 rural men and women and 1131 non–rural men and women, ages 18 to 39 years, were analyzed. No significant differences were found for any of the variables between those <b>who</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> {{in a rural area}} compared to those <b>who</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> in a non-rural area, although both groups reported HIV/STD risk behaviors. Hence, prevention education efforts appear justified in rural, as well urban area...|$|R

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. May 2016. Major: Business Administration. Advisor: Vladas Griskevicius. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); iv, 160 pages. I examine how <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> poor versus wealthy influences consumer behavior in adulthood. Previous {{findings show that}} <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> in resource-deprived conditions is associated with poor judgment and decision making. I develop a model to identify when people <b>who</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> poor make better decisions. I show that people <b>who</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> poor can make better health decisions and be better planners compared to those <b>who</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> wealthy. But these “positive effects of adverse childhoods” emerge only under specific conditions. For example, people <b>who</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> poor made better health decisions when they {{felt a sense of}} financial uncertainty and were provided information about the likelihood of getting sick. By integrating findings from human development and behavioral ecology, my dissertation shows how, when, and why people’s upbringing affects their choices in the marketplace. In addition to showing how specific features of our childhood environment have long-lasting effects on choices in adulthood, my dissertation points to ways of improving decision making for individuals <b>who</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> poor...|$|R
25|$|Manual {{babbling}} is structurally {{identical to}} vocal babbling in its development. Just as hearing and/or speaking infants babble with their mouths, infants <b>who</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> {{with a sign}} language babble with their hands. If a hearing infant has deaf and/or mute parents or parents who otherwise use a sign language, {{he or she will}} still imitate the signs that they see their parents displaying. This is evidence that manual babbling is possible in both hearing and deaf infants, and in both speaking and mute infants.|$|E
25|$|Children are {{especially}} vulnerable to these developmental and psychological consequences of trafficking due to their age. In order to gain complete control of the child, traffickers often destroy {{physical and mental health}} of the children through persistent physical and emotional abuse. Victims experience severe trauma on a daily basis that devastates the healthy development of self-concept, self-worth, biological integrity, and cognitive functioning. Children <b>who</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> in constant environments of exploitation frequently exhibit antisocial behavior, over-sexualized behavior, self-harm, aggression, distrust of adults, dissociative disorders, substance abuse, complex trauma, and attention deficit disorders. Stockholm syndrome is also a common problem for girls while they are trafficked, which can hinder them from both trying to escape, and moving forward in psychological recovery programs.|$|E
25|$|Drugs, supplements, or diets {{are often}} used to alter {{physiology}} {{in an attempt to}} relieve common autistic symptoms such as seizures, sleep disturbances, irritability, and hyperactivity that can interfere with education or social adaptation or (more rarely) cause autistic individuals to harm themselves or others. There is plenty of anecdotal evidence to support medical treatment; many parents who try one or more therapies report some progress, and there are a few well-publicized reports of children who are able to return to mainstream education after treatment, with dramatic improvements in health and well-being. However, this evidence may be confounded by improvements seen in autistic children <b>who</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> without treatment, by the difficulty of verifying reports of improvements, and by the lack of reporting of treatments' negative outcomes. Only a very few medical treatments are well supported by scientific evidence using controlled experiments.|$|E

25|$|It {{is also a}} {{question}} open to debate whether there are genetic influences on the tendency of the co-twins to change, without keeping in mind {{the direction of the}} change. Another factor that can be addressed is biological versus adoptive relatives and can be clearly seen in what is a real-life experiment: adoption. This creates two groups: genetic relatives (biological parents and siblings) and environmental relatives (adoptive parents and siblings). After studying hundreds of adoptive families, researchers discovered that people <b>who</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> together, whether biologically related or not, do not much resemble one another in personality. In characteristics such as extroversion and agreeableness, adoptees are more like their biological parents than their adoptive parents. However, the minute shared-environment effects do not mean that adoptive parenting is ineffective. Even though genetics may limit the family environment's influence on personality, parents do influence their children's attitudes, values, faith, manners, and politics. In adoptive homes, child neglect and abuse and even divorce between the parents is uncommon. This noted it is not surprising, despite a somewhat greater risk of psychological disorder, that most adopted children excel, especially when they are adopted as infants. In fact, seven out of eight have reported feeling a strong connection with one or even both of their adoptive parents.|$|E

He followed these with Charley, Charlotte and the Golden Canary, a modern fairy tale about two children <b>who</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> in the same street, are separated when one family moves to a new tower block, and are reunited thanks to a pet canary, which depicts the gradual disappearance of the London of Keeping's childhood, a theme he would persistently revisit. The full-colour illustrations are messy and spontaneous, using intense colour, sponge texturing and wax resist, and won Keeping his first Greenaway Medal.

2500|$|A {{potential}} important {{influence on}} adolescence is {{change of the}} family dynamic, specifically divorce. With the divorce rate up to about 50%, divorce is common and adds to the already great amount of change in adolescence. Custody disputes soon after a divorce often reflect a playing out of control battles and ambivalence between parents. Divorce usually results in less contact between the adolescent and their noncustodial parent. [...] In extreme cases of instability and abuse in homes, divorce can {{have a positive effect}} on families due to less conflict in the home. However, most research suggests a negative effect on adolescence as well as later development. A recent study found that, compared with peers <b>who</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> in stable post-divorce families, children of divorce who experience additional family transitions during late adolescence, make less progress in their math and social studies performance over time. Another recent study put forth a new theory entitled the adolescent epistemological trauma theory, which posited that traumatic life events such as parental divorce during the formative period of late adolescence portend lifelong effects on adult conflict behavior that can be mitigated by effective behavioral assessment and training. A parental divorce during childhood or adolescence continues to have a negative effect when a person is in his or her twenties and early thirties. These negative effects include romantic relationships and conflict style, meaning as adults, they are more likely to use the styles of avoidance and competing in conflict management.|$|E
2500|$|The Improper Use of Magic Office is {{responsible}} for investigating offences under the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery and the International Confederation of Wizards' Statute of Secrecy. They regulate an under-age wizard's or witch's use of magic and prohibit wizards and witches from performing magic {{in the presence of}} Muggles or in a Muggle-inhabited area in the Harry Potter universe. An enchantment called [...] "the Trace" [...] is placed upon children and helps the department detect offences; it breaks when they reach the age of 17. However, Dumbledore explains to Harry that the Ministry cannot tell who exactly uses magic in a given area, only that it has been used. This can be seen as unfair to young witches and wizards {{who grew up in the}} muggle-world (such as muggle born wizards or those with one magical and one muggle-parent) as they are more likely to be caught using magic than those <b>who</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> in the wizard world. Those living in the muggle-world generally have no contact with other witches or wizards away from school and the Ministry simply presumes that any magic performed where they are is an act of under-age wizardry, while at the same time presuming that any magic performed in a wizard home that has minors present was performed by those aged 17 and over. This means that minors living in the wizard world have a much greater chance of escaping punishment for the use of under-age magic. The Ministry has to rely on wizard and witch parents to enforce the ban on under-age magic within their homes.|$|E
