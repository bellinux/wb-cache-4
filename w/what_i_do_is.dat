25|$|I admire {{a lot of}} what's {{going on}} out there, but the {{oversize}} kind of cartoon action movies is not something I'm terribly comfortable with. I think <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> much more in the tradition that the bullets are real and they'll knock you down. I used to really get criticized for my lack of realism, but now I think my films {{are perceived to be}} vastly more realistic than most of the action movies that are happening out there... I {{think one of the things}} about being a director is, you should always try to re-create within yourself the kind of emotions you had watching film when you were very young. The kind of action movies that I always liked, the kind of comic books I always liked, were the serious ones. The characters were very realistic within the framework of the drama, and that kind of action movie interests me a lot more than the super-heroes. And so in that sense, maybe I'm slightly out of step, I suppose, but so be it.|$|E

Transcend is a {{recovery}} community with nine locations in Houston, New York, and Los Angeles. In an interview with Ellen DeGeneres, he stated, [...] "I started a foundation called the Focus Intensity Foundation, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> I raise money for scholarships for people who can’t afford treatment, mental health treatment." [...] In April, he wrote an article for The Players' Tribune titled [...] "Letter to My Younger Self", describing his NFL career and life after its end.|$|E

For instance Lola Lupin who I mentioned before won't eat her dinner. So <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> say, [...] "yes it is rotten food, let us sing a song", making sure that that particular chanson has a few vowels in it that require her to open her mouth! During which I pop the spoon in and I have won the argument. However if it is an argument with a person that knows their subject <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> nod sagely and smile superciliously, let them ramble on, and at the end I say [...] "well I'm sorry, I think you're completely wrong", turn on my heels and leave.

2500|$|In September 2013 Salmon {{recalled}} [...] "a {{whole lot}} of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> tied up in my past. The Scientists, The Beasts of Bourbon, The Surrealists. This is great, but I still like to make new stuff. I've kept my sanity {{over the years by}} doing new stuff and waiting for it to become old enough to be revived". He described how The Surrealists reformed in 2006, for a one-off concert at Azkena Festival, Spain. The Scientists also reunited in 2006 and recorded their performance at Shepherd's Bush, which was issued as a live album, Sedition in the following year.|$|E
2500|$|The {{music of}} Ghetto Gothic is varied, {{incorporating}} elements of classical music, hip hop, reggae, and blues. Van Peebles stated of the album's musical experimentation, [...] "So many black artists are encouraged {{not to eat}} from the entire cornucopia of creative and technical options. I'm black; so <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> black. Once you don't worry about that, you're free to manifest your artistry however you see it." [...] Van Peebles' lyrics range from lighter, humorous themes to more socially conscious material, such as [...] "Just Don't Make Sense", which focuses on the contradictions of the African American experience.|$|E
2500|$|Technically, Degas {{differs from}} the Impressionists in that he {{continually}} belittled their practice of painting en plein air. [...] "He was often as anti-impressionist as the critics who reviewed the shows", according to art historian Carol Armstrong; as Degas himself explained, [...] "no art was ever less spontaneous than mine. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> the result of reflection and {{of the study of}} the great masters; of inspiration, spontaneity, temperament, I know nothing." [...] Nonetheless, he is described more accurately as an Impressionist than as a member of any other movement. His scenes of Parisian life, his off-center compositions, his experiments with color and form, and his friendship with several key Impressionist artists—most notably Mary Cassatt and Édouard Manet—all relate him intimately to the Impressionist movement.|$|E
5000|$|So <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>was,</b> <b>I</b> {{sit down}} and I ting ting ting, until I get answer lor. (So I sat down, thought, thought and thought, until I understood.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Seth {{was sentenced}} to three years {{probation}} and a $2500 fine. In his court statement, Seth stated [...] "I knew <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> wrong as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> it, but <b>I</b> didn't realize the severity of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing.</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> all <b>I</b> can to remove myself from this situation...I never want to find myself in that situation again." ...|$|R

6000|$|I {{suppose she}} and Solivet {{expected}} me to submit myself to my fate like a good little French girl. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> to turn round and exclaim: 'Eustace, you have not sold me for this?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is not an}} insult," [...] said Keswick quietly. [...] "It was {{a service}} of--of affection. I saw that you were annoyed and troubled by Mr Croft's failure to keep his engagement, and <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> simply--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What I mean is, that I {{hope you}} are not going to quarrel with me on that account? <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> <b>is</b> it not <b>what</b> you would have done in my position--only you would have done it successfully?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I ain't {{going to}} be harsh. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> for her own good, you know that, Mother. Josie is as dear to me as she is to you, but we've got to be stricter with her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Freddie was not right," [...] flared Jill. The {{recollection}} of her conversation with that prominent artist {{still had the}} power to fire her independent soul. [...] "I'm not a child. I can look after myself. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> my own business." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, it's {{the easiest}} thing in life," [...] said the cousin. [...] "Only {{remember}} this: you mustn't get astray; {{that is what they}} call presence of mind, you know. I'll tell you what I do, and I'm often called up, you know; at our agriculturals I always propose the farmers' daughters: well, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> this--I keep my eye steadfastly fixed on one of the bottles, and never move it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> for {{the sake}} of the doctor," [...] {{continued}} Miss Panney.

6000|$|... "You {{think it}} pleases me to spy upon {{you and a}} certain lady," [...] went on Kari with an unruffled voice, [...] "but it is not so. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> for good reasons, amongst others that I may protect you both, and if I can, bring about what you desire. That lady has a great heart, as I learned but now, and after all you did well to love her, as she does well to love you. Therefore, {{although}} the dangers are so many, if I am able, I will help you in your love and bring you together, yes, and save her from the arms of Urco. Nay, ask me not how, for I do not know, and the case seems desperate." ...|$|E
5000|$|... “The {{focus of}} that story was {{obviously}} Dave Bliss, but other people {{got caught up in}} it, which is unfortunate,” Koncak said. “But, yes, there had been some benefits while I was at SMU, and <b>I</b> <b>did</b> accept some of those benefits. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> against the rules." ...|$|R

60|$|THE BURGLAR. I don't {{set up to}} {{be better}} than my fellow-creatures, and never did, as you well know, Captain. But <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> {{innocent}} and pious. I enquire about for houses where the right sort of people live. I work it on them same as I worked it here. I break into the house; put a few spoons or diamonds in my pocket; make a noise; get caught; and take up a collection. And you wouldn't believe {{how hard it is to}} get caught when you're actually trying to. I have knocked over all the chairs in a room without a soul paying any attention to me. In the end I have had to walk out and leave the job.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{knew that}} I could trust you, Martin, and {{the proof of}} it is that I have spoken to you so openly," [...] went on Maldon in a gentler voice. [...] "Well, you shall hear all. The great Emperor of Germany and Spain is on our side, as, seeing his blood and faith, he must be. He will avenge the wrongs of the Church and of his royal aunt. I, who know him, am his agent here, and <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> done at his bidding. But I must have more money than he finds me, and that is why I stirred in this matter of the Shefton lands. Also the Lady Cicely had jewels of vast price, though I fear greatly lest they should have been lost in the fire this night." ...|$|E
6000|$|He.--No doubt, {{gold and}} gold; gold is everything, {{and all the}} [...] rest without gold is nothing. So instead of cramming his head with [...] fine maxims which {{he would have to}} forget, on pain of {{remaining}} a [...] beggar all the days of his life, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> this: when I have a [...] louis, which does not happen to me often, I plant myself in front [...] of him, I pull the louis out of my pocket, I show it to him with [...] signs of admiration, I raise my eyes to heaven, I kiss the louis [...] before him, and to make him understand still better the importance [...] of the sacred coin, I point to him with my finger all that he can [...] get with it, a fine frock, a pretty cap, a rich cake; then I thrust [...] the louis into my pocket, I walk proudly up and down, I raise the [...] lappet of my waistcoat, I strike my fob; and in that way I make him [...] see that it is the louis in it that gives me all this assurance.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> think <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> quite clever. <b>I</b> {{dropped my}} letter unseen at his feet, and sauntered {{back to the}} club. Of course, a gentleman who finds a letter on the {{pavement}} feels bound to post it, and I presumed that he would naturally go to the nearest office.|$|R

6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] he answered. [...] "In Mr. Dowling's place <b>I</b> {{should have}} <b>done</b> the same thing. Every one with {{his way in}} life to make must look out for himself. Strictly speaking, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> wrong. <b>I</b> wish, however, that <b>I</b> had <b>done</b> it before. One must think of one's self first." ...|$|R
