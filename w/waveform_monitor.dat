50|$|Originally, <b>waveform</b> <b>monitors</b> {{were entirely}} analog devices; the {{incoming}} (analog) video signal was filtered and amplified, {{and the resulting}} voltage was used to drive the vertical axis of a cathode ray tube. A sync stripper circuit was used to isolate the sync pulses and colorburst from the video signal; the recovered sync information was fed to a sweep circuit which drove the horizontal axis. Early <b>waveform</b> <b>monitors</b> differed little from oscilloscopes, except for the specialized video trigger circuitry. <b>Waveform</b> <b>monitors</b> also {{permit the use of}} external reference; in this mode the sync and burst signals are taken from a separate input (thus allowing all devices in a facility to be genlocked, or synchronized to the same timing source).|$|R
50|$|Modern <b>waveform</b> <b>monitors</b> {{and other}} {{oscilloscopes}} have largely abandoned old-style CRT technology as well. All new <b>waveform</b> <b>monitors</b> {{are based on}} a rasterizer, a piece of graphics hardware that duplicates the behavior of a CRT vector display, generating a raster signal. They may come with a flat-panel liquid crystal display, or they may be sold without a display, in which case the user can connect any VGA display.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>waveform</b> <b>monitor</b> in {{television}} broadcast engineering {{is very close}} to a standard oscilloscope, but it includes triggering circuits and controls that allow a stable display of a composite video frame, field, or even a selected line out of a field. Robert Hartwig explains the <b>waveform</b> <b>monitor</b> as [...] "providing a graphic display of the black-and-white portion of the picture." [...] The black-and-white portion of the video signal is called the [...] "luminance" [...] due to its fluorescent complexion. The waveform monitor's display of black vs. white levels allows the engineer to troubleshoot the quality of the picture and be certain that it is within the required standards. For convenience, the vertical scale of the <b>waveform</b> <b>monitor</b> is calibrated in IRE units.|$|E

50|$|In video applications, a {{vectorscope}} supplements a <b>waveform</b> <b>monitor</b> for {{the purpose}} of measuring and testing television signals, regardless of format (NTSC, PAL, SECAM or any number of digital television standards). While a <b>waveform</b> <b>monitor</b> allows a broadcast technician to measure the overall characteristics of a video signal, a vectorscope is used to visualize chrominance, which is encoded into the video signal as a subcarrier of specific frequency. The vectorscope locks exclusively to the chrominance subcarrier in the video signal (at 3.58 MHz for NTSC, or at 4.43 MHz for PAL) to drive its display. In digital applications, a vectorscope instead plots the Cb and Cr channels against each other (these are the two channels in digital formats which contain chroma information).|$|E

50|$|A {{vectorscope}} is {{a special}} type of oscilloscope used in both audio and video applications. Whereas an oscilloscope or <b>waveform</b> <b>monitor</b> normally displays a plot of signal vs. time, a vectorscope displays an X-Y plot of two signals, which can reveal details {{about the relationship between}} these two signals. Vectorscopes are highly similar in operation to oscilloscopes operated in X-Y mode; however those used in video applications have specialized graticules, and accept standard television or video signals as input (demodulating and demultiplexing the two components to be analyzed internally).|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of {{instruments}} used {{in a variety of}} technical fields are really oscilloscopes with inputs, calibration, controls, display calibration, etc., specialized and optimized for a particular application. Examples of such oscilloscope-based instruments include <b>waveform</b> <b>monitors</b> for analyzing video levels in television productions and medical devices such as vital function monitors and electrocardiogram and electroencephalogram instruments. In automobile repair, an ignition analyzer is used to show the spark waveforms for each cylinder. All of these are essentially oscilloscopes, performing the basic task of showing the changes in one or more input signals over time in an X‑Y display.|$|R

It is thus important to develop measurement techniques and solutions capable of unambiguously quantifying such signals and associated hardware. Although one can adapt certain techniques developed for wireless signal characterization, significant differences exist between optical and RF wireless implementations of advanced modulation formats. To meet this measurement demand we present a method for characterizing high symbol rate multilevel modulation optical signals with high fidelity, based on coherent optical sampling, as a complement to the standard real-time electrical sampling approach. The technique enables constellation-and <b>waveform</b> <b>monitoring,</b> bit-error rate and error-vector magnitude analysis, which makes it suitable for transmitter characterization...|$|R
50|$|The {{level of}} a video signal usually {{corresponds}} to the brightness, or luminance, of {{the part of the}} image being drawn onto a regular video screen at the same point in time. A <b>waveform</b> <b>monitor</b> can be used to display the overall brightness of a television picture, or it can zoom in to show one or two individual lines of the video signal. It {{can also be used to}} visualize and observe special signals in the vertical blanking interval of a video signal, as well as the colorburst between each line of video.|$|E
50|$|With {{the advent}} of digital {{television}} and digital signal processing, the <b>waveform</b> <b>monitor</b> acquired many new features and capabilities. Modern waveform monitors contain many additional modes of operation, including picture mode (where the video picture is simply presented on the screen, much like a television), various modes optimized for color gamut checking, support for the audio portion of a television program (either embedded with the video, or on separate inputs), eye pattern and jitter displays for measuring the physical layer parameters of serial-digital television formats, modes for examining the serial digital protocol layer, and support for ancillary data and television-related metadata such as timecode, closed captions and the v-chip rating systems.|$|E
5000|$|Time base {{correction}} counteracts errors by buffering {{the video}} signal {{as it comes}} off the videotape at an unsteady rate, and releasing it at a steady rate. TBCs also allow a variable delay in the video stream. By adjusting the rate and delay using a <b>waveform</b> <b>monitor</b> and a vectorscope, the corrected signal can now match {{the timing of the}} other devices in the system. If all of the devices in a system are adjusted so their signals meet the video switcher {{at the same time and}} at the same rate, the signals can be mixed. A single master clock or [...] "sync generator" [...] provides the reference for all of the devices' clocks.|$|E
50|$|On older vectorscopes {{implemented}} with {{cathode ray}} tubes (CRTs), the graticule was often implemented as a silk-screened overlay which was superimposed {{over the front}} surface of the CRT. One notable exception was the Tektronix WFM601 series of instruments, which are combined <b>waveform</b> <b>monitors</b> and vectorscopes used to measure CCIR 601 television signals. The waveform-mode graticule of these instruments is implemented with a silkscreen, whereas the vectorscope graticule (consisting only of bar targets, as this family did not support composite video) was drawn on the CRT by the electron beam. Modern instruments have graticules drawn using computer graphics, and both graticule and trace are rendered on an external VGA monitor or an internal VGA-compatible LCD display.|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{evidence}} shows that goal-directed hemodynamic management can improve outcomes in surgical and intensive care settings. Arterial waveform analysis {{is one of the}} different techniques used for guiding goal-directed therapy. Multiple proprietary systems have developed algorithms for obtaining cardiac output from an arterial waveform, including the FloTrac, LiDCO, and PiCCO systems. These systems vary in terms of how they analyze the arterial pressure waveform as well as their requirements for invasive line placement and calibration. Although small-scale clinical trials using these monitors show promising data, large-scale multicenter trials are still needed to better determine how intraoperative goal-directed therapy with arterial waveform analysis can improve patient outcomes.
