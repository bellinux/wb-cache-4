Club gave [...] "Closing Time" [...] a grade of [...] "B+", feeling that the episode was more about small character moments than the Cybermen plot. Though he wrote it was not as strong as [...] "The Lodger", he praised the way it gave a break before the season finale to bring out the softer side of the Doctor. Digital Spy's Morgan Jeffery praised Smith, Corden, and Lynda Baron as Val, and felt that it was a [...] "relief" [...] to have a fun episode after two emotional heavy ones. However, he did not think it was as good as [...] "The Lodger" [...] and thought the Cybermen were [...] "wasted", citing the conclusion of Craig blowing them up with love as [...] "unsatisfactory". Andrew Blair of Den of Geek defended the Cybermen in the episode, opining that the episode brought out the tragedy of them barely surviving and having to convert people mechanically without any emotional understanding of the situation.|$|E

On approaching this subject, Tancharoen said that there was no nervousness in the writer's room, and Whedon said that the similarities to Trump's America was simply an attempt to [...] "paint the reality where, what if the world just turned upside down?" [...] The pod sees Hydra based out of the Triskelion, a S.H.I.E.L.D. building that was destroyed by Hydra previously in the MCU.

The tour's female-focused concept {{was inspired by}} other male recording artists who [...] "did things special like this for their female fans", such as Teddy Pendergrass, Marvin Gaye and Prince. Enjoying the challenge of a female-only tour, Usher said, [...] "There [...] only a few artists that can pull that off, I feel like I've had such a connection with my audience. This album, I felt like, was definitely the type of one that was more intimate. So <b>what</b> <b>better</b> <b>way</b> to get {{up close and personal}} than to make it all women?" [...] Usher performed the tour with a Dsquared2 wardrobe. At each show, one fan was brought onstage [...] "for an even more intimate experience with the singer". This took place during [...] "Superstar"; a female fan was served champagne and strawberries by Usher while sitting on his lap as he sang to her. Among Usher's own songs, the setlist also included portions of Stevie Wonder's [...] "Rocket Love", Gaye's [...] "I Want You" [...] and Prince's [...] "Do Me, Baby". At the Detroit show he also gave T-Baby's [...] "It's So Cold in the D". Usher was supported by a five-piece band, three backing vocalists and four backup dancers.|$|E

500|$|Lagaan was {{met with}} high {{critical}} acclaim. The film currently scores a 95% [...] "Certified Fresh" [...] approval rating on review aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes, based on 59 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The site's critical consensus is, [...] "Lagaan is lavish, rousing entertainment in the old-fashioned tradition of Hollywood musicals." [...] Derek Elley of Variety suggested that it [...] "could be the trigger for Bollywood's long-awaited crossover to non-ethnic markets". Somni Sengupta of The New York Times, described it as [...] "a carnivalesque genre packed with romance, swordplay and improbable song-and-dance routines" [...] Roger Ebert gave three and half out of four stars and said, [...] "Lagaan is an enormously entertaining movie, like nothing we've ever seen before, and yet completely familiar... At the same time, it's a memory of the films we all grew up on, with clearly defined villains and heroes, a romantic triangle, and even a comic character who saves the day. Lagaan is a well-crafted, hugely entertaining epic that has the spice of a foreign culture." [...] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian described the film as [...] "a lavish epic, a gorgeous love story, and a rollicking adventure yarn. Larger than life and outrageously enjoyable, it's got a dash of spaghetti western, a hint of Kurosawa, with a bracing shot of Kipling." [...] Kuljinder Singh of the BBC stated that [...] "Lagaan is anything but standard Bollywood fodder, and is the first must-see of the Indian summer. A movie that will have you laughing and crying, but leaving with a smile." [...] Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times argued that the film is [...] "an affectionate homage to a popular genre that raises it {{to the level of}} an art film with fully drawn characters, a serious underlying theme, and a sophisticated style and point of view." [...] Sudish Kamath of The Hindu suggested that [...] "the movie is not just a story. It is an experience. An experience of watching something that puts life into you, that puts a cheer on your face, however depressed you might be." [...] The Times of India wrote, [...] "Lagaan has all the attractions of big-sounding A. R. Rahman songs, excellent performances by Aamir Khan... and a successful debut for pretty Gracy Singh. In addition, there is the celebrated David vs Goliath cricket match, which has audiences screaming and clapping." [...] Perhaps one of the most emphatic recommendations for the movie, coming 10 years later, is by John Nugent of the Trenton Independent, who wrote [...] "a masterpiece ... and <b>what</b> <b>better</b> <b>way</b> to learn a bit about India's colonial experience! History and great entertainment, all rolled in to one (albeit long) classic film." ...|$|E

40|$|One of the {{difficulties}} in teaching global sustainability in the introductory political science classes is the different emphases placed on this concept {{and the absence of}} the consensus on where the overall balance between environmental protection, economic development, and social justice should reside. Like many fuzzy concepts with which students struggle, teaching sustainability lends itself to pedagogical examination within the scholarship of threshold concepts. This article investigates students’ understanding of sustainability in the seven semesters when the concept of sustainability was introduced via role-playing simulation and compares it with the similar data from a more recent semester when simulation was supplemented with traditional lecture and classroom exercises. Ultimately, our research question is twofold: (1) How do students define a multifaceted concept like global sustainability and (2) <b>what</b> is the <b>better</b> <b>way</b> to teach it – active learning only or active learning in combination with traditional instruction...|$|R

40|$|There is a <b>better</b> <b>way</b> {{of dealing}} with the needs of {{refugees}} arriving in Australia – whether with or without a visa, by boat or by plane. This 2002 document has been added to APO as it outlines how the process could be done with little need for detention. The <b>Better</b> <b>Way</b> will not compromise Australia’s security, health or community values, and will actually be cheaper. There are alternatives to detention that do not compromise Australia’s security, are cheaper, more humane and which strengthen our sense of community. So <b>what</b> is a <b>better</b> <b>way?</b> Rather than being classified by how they arrived here, asylum seekers should be classified by their care needs and likely security risk. This would allow more refugees to be housed more cheaply in the community. The <b>Better</b> <b>Way</b> is a combination of three approaches:• Early evaluation of refugees to work out whether anyone poses a security risk, and whether there is a risk of absconding if they are placed in low-security housing• Case management by a social worker from a national welfare agency to work with people and families to ensure they understand Australia’s refugee system, and counsel people as they move through the legal process• Three accommodation options that house people according to a security assessment and care needs. Security is a feature. For example:• Community management for those considered at low risk, or no risk to the community or unlikely to abscond (this may include women and children, families and young people) • Medium security hostel accommodation for those considered medium risk or requiring intensive services• Continued detention for those considered high risk. The <b>Better</b> <b>Way</b> booklet is based on the JAS proposed alternative approaches to asylum seekers: Reception and Transitional Processing System   (JAS, June 2002).
