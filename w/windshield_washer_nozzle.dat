50|$|On some vehicles, a <b>windshield</b> <b>washer</b> {{system is}} also used. This system sprays water or an {{antifreeze}} window washer fluid at the windshield using several <b>nozzles.</b> The <b>windshield</b> <b>washer</b> system helps to remove dirt or {{dust from the}} windshield when it is used {{in concert with the}} wiper blades. When antifreeze <b>windshield</b> <b>washer</b> fluid is used, it can help the wipers to remove snow or ice. For winter conditions, some vehicles have additional heaters aimed at the windows or embedded heating wire in the glass. These defroster systems help to keep snow and ice from building up on the windshield. In rare cases, miniature wipers are installed on headlights.|$|R

40|$|Nine liquid {{disinfectants}} {{were tested}} {{for their ability}} to reduce infectivity of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts in cell culture. A 4 -min exposure to 6 % hydrogen peroxide and a 13 -min exposure to ammonium hydroxide-amended <b>windshield</b> <b>washer</b> fluid reduced infectivity 1, 000 -fold. Other disinfectants tested (70 % ethanol, 37 % methanol, 6 % sodium hypochlorite, 70 % isopropanol, and three commercial disinfectants) did not reduce the infectivity after a 33 -min exposure. The results indicate that hydrogen peroxide and <b>windshield</b> <b>washer</b> fluid or ammonium hydroxide disinfectant may be suitable laboratory disinfectants against C. parvum oocysts...|$|R
50|$|Documented sources include cooling towers, {{swimming}} pools (especially in Scandinavian countries), domestic water systems and showers, ice-making machines, refrigerated cabinets, whirlpool spas, hot springs, fountains, dental equipment, Soil, automobile <b>windshield</b> <b>washer</b> fluid, and industrial coolant.|$|R
50|$|The Volga was stylistically in {{line with}} the major United States {{manufacturers}} of the period in which it was introduced, and incorporated such then-luxury features as the reclining front seat, cigarette lighter, heater, <b>windshield</b> <b>washer</b> and 3-wave radio.|$|R
50|$|All of {{the other}} models, Commander, Daytona and Cruiser, were continued. The Commander, however, {{received}} some notable additional standard equipment in January 1966 as the company began including the Climatizer heater/defroster, <b>windshield</b> <b>washer,</b> and other items at no additional cost.|$|R
50|$|Several {{varieties}} of antifreeze are sold under the Prestone name, {{in addition to}} radiator additives, such as stop leaks. The Prestone name is also used for other automotive chemicals, including <b>windshield</b> <b>washer</b> fluid, as well as Prestone Heat, a sidewalk de-icer.|$|R

50|$|In 1995, the U.S. {{state of}} Oregon {{required}} that denatonium benzoate {{be added to}} products containing sweet-tasting ethylene glycol and methanol such as antifreeze and <b>windshield</b> <b>washer</b> fluid to prevent poisonings of children and animals. In December 2012, U.S. manufacturers voluntarily agreed to add denatonium benzoate to antifreeze sold nationwide.|$|R
50|$|Many cars {{display a}} warning when the fluid level is low, and some car makers have {{replaced}} the float sensor generating this signal with a simple two-pin probe in the tank. This requires a (slightly) conductive fluid, but most common <b>windshield</b> <b>washer</b> fluid mixtures will work. Mercedes sells a special fluid for their cars.|$|R
50|$|In {{the built}} environment, central air {{conditioning}} systems in office buildings, hotels, and hospitals are sources of contaminated water. Other places it can dwell include cooling towers used in industrial cooling systems, evaporative coolers, nebulizers, humidifiers, whirlpool spas, hot water systems, showers, <b>windshield</b> <b>washers,</b> fountains, room-air humidifiers, ice-making machines, and misting systems typically found in grocery-store produce sections.|$|R
25|$|A {{videotape}} of Pickton's friend Scott Chubb saying Pickton {{had told him}} {{a good way to}} kill a female heroin addict was to inject her with <b>windshield</b> <b>washer</b> fluid. A second tape was played for Pickton, in which an associate named Andrew Bellwood said Pickton mentioned killing prostitutes by handcuffing and strangling them, then bleeding and gutting them before feeding them to pigs.|$|R

50|$|Consumer {{advocacy}} groups and auto enthusiasts {{believe that the}} alcohols and solvents present in some, but not all, <b>windshield</b> <b>washer</b> fluid can damage the vehicle. These critics point to the corrosive effects of ethanol, methanol, and other components on paint, rubber, car wax, and plastics, and groups propose various alternatives and homemade recipes to protect the finish and mechanics of the motor vehicle.|$|R
50|$|Most {{windscreen}} wipers operate {{together with a}} windscreen (or windshield) washer; a pump that supplies a mixture of water, alcohol, and detergent (a blend called <b>windshield</b> <b>washer</b> fluid) from a tank to the windscreen. The fluid is dispensed through small nozzles mounted on the hood. Conventional nozzles are usually used, but some designs use a fluidic oscillator to disperse the fluid more effectively.|$|R
50|$|The front {{underhood}} compartment {{contains the}} charger, an electric air conditioner, the power steering mechanism, the power brake unit (otherwise conventional), a radiator {{for the air}} conditioner, and a vacuum pump and reservoir for the power brakes and a reservoir for the <b>windshield</b> <b>washer.</b> Charger and battery liquid cooling service is performed here but is not an owner-operator service item.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{technically}} a subseries of the Cadillac Series 62 {{based on}} the regular Series 62 convertible, sharing its engine, it was nearly twice as expensive at US$7,750. The 220.8 in long, 80.1 in wide vehicle came with such standard features as <b>windshield</b> <b>washers,</b> a signal seeking radio, power windows, and a heater. The Eldorado comprised only [...]5% of Cadillac's sales in 1953.|$|R
50|$|Standard {{equipment}} for 1953 included bumper guards, electric clock, lined trunk, dual horns, cigarette lighter, chrome moldings, twin interior sun visors, rear seat robe rails, special rear stainless steel trim, chrome window ventiplanes, <b>windshield</b> <b>washer,</b> and Deluxe steering wheel with horn ring.

50|$|Vibration and {{low-speed}} crash tests ensured {{the cars}} would not shift or suffer damage in transit. The Vega was delivered topped with fluids, ready {{to drive to}} dealerships, so the engine was baffled to prevent oil entering the number one cylinder; the battery filler caps high on the rear edge of the casing prevented acid spills; a tube drained fuel from carburetor to vapor canister; and the <b>windshield</b> <b>washer</b> bottle stood at 45 degrees.|$|R
2500|$|The 1984 {{model year}} saw {{the return of}} the two-door sport coupe making a three model line-up. Styling {{remained}} unchanged. 1984 models were virtually identical to 1981 models. The <b>windshield</b> <b>washer</b> controls were moved from the dashboard to the turn signal stalk to create the multi-stalk. The optional cruise control (which continued to be mounted on the turn signal stalk) now featured acceleration/deceleration in [...] increments. An optional Landau package included a vinyl roof, sport mirrors and reveal moldings.|$|R
50|$|The {{documentary}} Who Killed the Electric Car? shows {{a comparison}} between the parts that require replacement in gasoline-powered cars and EV1s, with the garages stating that they bring the electric cars in every 5000 mi, rotate the tires, fill the <b>windshield</b> <b>washer</b> fluid and send them back out again. Other advantages of electric cars are {{that they do not}} need to be driven to petrol stations and there are often fewer fluids which need to be changed.|$|R
