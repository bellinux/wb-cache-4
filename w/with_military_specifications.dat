40|$|A low-cost, low-mass, {{electrically}} efficient, modular cathode/electron gun assembly {{has been}} developed by FDE Inc. of Beaverton, Oregon, under a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract with the NASA Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field. This new assembly offers significant improvements {{in the design and}} manufacture of microwave and millimeter wave traveling-wave tubes (TWT's) used for radar and communications. It incorporates a novel, low-heater-power, reduced size and mass, high-performance barium dispenser type thermionic cathode and provides for easy integration of the cathode into a large variety of conventional TWT circuits. Among the applications are TWT's for Earth-orbiting communication satellites and for deep space communications, where future missions will require smaller spacecraft, higher data transfer rates (higher frequencies and radiofrequency output power), and greater electrical efficiency. A particularly important TWT application is in the microwave power module (a hybrid microwave/millimeter wave amplifier consisting of a low-noise solid-state driver, a small TWT, and an electronic power conditioner integrated into a single compact package), where electrical efficiency and thermal loading are critical factors and lower cost is needed for successful commercialization. The design and fabrication are based on practices used in producing cathode ray tubes (CRT's), {{which is one of the}} most competitive and efficient manufacturing operations in the world today. The approach used in the design and manufacture of thermionic cathodes and electron guns for CRT's has been optimized for fully automated production, standardization of parts, and minimization of costs. It is applicable to the production of similar components for microwave tubes, with the additional benefits of low mass and significantly lower cathode heater power (less than half that of dispenser cathodes presently used in TWT s). Modular cathode/electron gun assembly. The modular cathode/electron gun assembly consists of four subassemblies the cathode, the focus electrode, the header (including the electrical feedthroughs), and the gun envelope (including the anode) a diagram of which is shown. The modular construction offers a number of significant advantages, including flexibility of design, interchangeability of parts, and a drop-in final assembly procedure for quick and accurate alignment. The gun can accommodate cathodes ranging in size from 0. 050 to 0. 250 -in. in diameter and is applicable to TWT's over a broad range of sizes and operating parameters, requiring the substitution of only a few parts: that is, the cathode, focus electrode, and anode. The die-pressed cathode pellets can be made with either flat or concave (Pierce gun design) emitting surfaces. The gun can be either gridded (pulse operation) or ungridded (continuous operation). Important factors contributing to low cost are the greater use of CRT materials and parts, the standardization of processes (welding and mechanical capture), and tooling amenable to automated production. Examples are the use of simple shapes, drawn or stamped metal parts, and parts joined by welding or mechanical capture. Feasibility was successfully demonstrated in the retrofit and testing of a commercial Kaband (22 -GHz) TWT. The modular cathode/electron gun assembly was computer modeled to replicate the performance of the original electron gun and fabricated largely from existing CRT parts. Significant test results included demonstration of low heater power (1. 5 -W, 1010 C brightness temperature for a 0. 085 -in. -diameter cathode), mechanical ruggedness (100 g shock and vibration tests in accordance <b>with</b> <b>military</b> <b>specifications</b> (MIL specs)), and a very fast warmup. The results of these tests indicate that the low-cost CRT manufacturing approach can be used without sacrificing performance and reliability...|$|E

Both process parameters affect the specular reflectance characteristics when measured using a 660 nm, collimated diode laser source. The etch process time, when varied between 0. 5 to 20 minutes, resulted in a decrease in specular reflectivity with increasing time. The anodization process potential was varied between 10 and 21 volts, with a 15 volt condition producing samples with the greatest specular reflectivity. Between the two parameters, the etch time had the greater effect. Additionally, the dependence of the incident beam angle on specular reflectivity was shown not to have a significant effect when compared to the etch process time and process potential...|$|R

The piezostack actuator connected with the inertial mass generates actively the control force.

40|$|In {{response}} to the Air Force directive to remove Ozone Depleting Chemicals (ODC's) from <b>military</b> <b>specifications</b> and Defense Logistics Agency's Hazardous Waste Minimization Program, {{we are faced with}} how to ensure a quality aviation fuel without using such chemicals. Many of these chemicals are found throughout the fuel and fuel related <b>military</b> <b>specifications</b> and are part of test methods that help qualify the properties and quality of the fuels before they are procured. Many years ago there was a directive for <b>military</b> <b>specifications</b> to use commercially standard test methods in order to provide standard testing in private industry and government. As a result the test methods used in <b>military</b> <b>specifications</b> are governed by the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM). The Air Force has been very proactive in the removal or replacement of the ODC's and hazardous materials in these test methods. For example, ASTM D 3703 (Standard Test Method for Peroxide Number of Aviation Turbine Fuels), requires the use of Freon 113, a known ODC. A new rapid, portable hydroperoxide test for jet fuels similar to ASTM D 3703 that does not require the use of ODC's has been developed. This test has proved, in limited testing, to be a viable substitute method for ASTM D 3703. The Air Force is currently conducting a round robin to allow the method to be accepted by ASTM and therefore replace the current method. This paper will describe the Air Force's initiatives to remove ODC's and hazardous materials from the fuel and fuel related <b>military</b> <b>specifications</b> that the Air Force Wright Laboratory...|$|R
