500|$|Discussing the {{apparent}} {{failure of the}} cinematic universe's first team-up film, , to establish a successful equivalent to the MCU, Todd VanDerWerff noted that where the MCU has a television-like [...] "showrunner" [...] in Feige, [...] "the visionary behind Marvel's entire slate", the DCEU has director Zack Snyder, whose DC films [...] "seemingly start from the assumption that people have come not to see an individual story but {{a long series of}} teases for other ones. It's like he knows <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> but can't focus on the task at hand. TV certainly isn't immune to that problem, but shows that get caught up in high-concept premises and big-picture thinking before doing the necessary legwork to establish characters and their relationships tend to be canceled." [...] Subsequently, in May 2016, Warner Bros. gave oversight of the DCEU to Johns and executive Jon Berg in an attempt to [...] "unify the disparate elements of the DC movies" [...] and emulate Marvel's success. The two were made producers on the Justice League films, on top of Johns' involvement in several [...] "solo" [...] films, such as the post-production process of Suicide Squad or the writing process of a standalone Batman film. After the successful release of Wonder Woman in June 2017, DC decided to begin deemphasizing the shared nature of their films, with DC Entertainment president Diane Nelson stating, [...] "Our intention, certainly, moving forward is using the continuity to help make sure nothing is diverging in a way that doesn’t make sense, but there’s no insistence upon an overall story line or interconnectivity in that universe... Moving forward, you’ll see the DC movie universe being a universe, but one that comes from the heart of the filmmaker who’s creating them." [...] Additionally, DC began focusing on films [...] "completely separate from everything else, set entirely outside the" [...] DCEU as part of a new label, with the first centered on the Joker.|$|E

It's him doing <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to move forward." [...] The petition states that Carter's biggest creditor is the U.S. government; [...] "he owes the Internal Revenue Service $1.3 million in back taxes from his income in 2003, when Carter was just 16." ...|$|E

Interviewed in 2000, Ant's then manager Bryan Stanton claimed that, since the Blend session, a second set of songs had been demoed and that Adam {{intended}} to compile a new album from the highlights of both sets. [...] Stanton reported of Blend that [...] "there's loads of legal nonsense behind it. It was set up with two other people, and one of those people is causing a few problems. So <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is leave that and set up another one".|$|E
2500|$|Souders and Peterson {{revealed}} that the theme for season ten will be [...] "facing the ghosts of your past and how [...] helps you move on in the future"; as such, the return of previous cast members will play into this. Souders and Peterson also chose not to erase Lois's memory of Clark's secret, something she discovered in the season nine finale. Instead, Lois helped Clark do <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to get away and fulfill his destiny without telling him that she knows. The producers explained {{that there would be}} [...] "some twists and turns" [...] before Lois tells Clark that she knows. Initially helping Clark and Oliver at Watchtower, a secret from her past will define whether Tess ultimately ends on the side of good or bad. Chloe's ending will also be told [...] "in a way that's fitting for Chloe." [...] She will [...] "sacrifice" [...] herself for Oliver, who has been informed that she was killed.
