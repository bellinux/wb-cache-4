25|$|After commissioning, Nepal was {{assigned}} to the Home Fleet, based at Scapa Flow. During this time, the ship was filmed to represent the fictional HMS Torrin for the British war film In Which <b>We</b> <b>Serve.</b> In July 1942, the destroyer was reassigned to the British Eastern Fleet, and sailed from Scotland to Kenya. During September, the destroyer was involved in the later parts of the Madagascar Campaign. During the rest of 1942, the destroyer operated on convoy escort runs and anti-submarine patrols from Kilindini. In March 1943, Nepal sailed to Australia for a two-month refit during April and May.|$|E
25|$|While {{the three}} ships were {{rounding}} {{the western side}} of Crete, they were attacked by 24 Stuka dive bombers. Kashmir was hit and sank in two minutes, Kelly was hit and turned turtle soon after and later sank. Kelly shot down a Stuka immediately and another was badly damaged and crashed upon returning to base. Kipling survived 83 bombs, while 279 survivors were rescued from the ships. (The Noël Coward film In Which <b>We</b> <b>Serve</b> was based on this action.) The Royal Navy had suffered so many losses from air attacks that on 23 May, Admiral Cunningham signalled his superiors that daylight operations could no longer continue but the Chiefs of Staff demurred. German search-and-rescue aircraft and Italian motor torpedo boats, spotted and rescued the 262 survivors from the German light convoy sunk off Cape Spatha.|$|E
25|$|Attenborough's {{acting career}} started {{on stage and}} he {{appeared}} in shows at Leicester's Little Theatre, Dover Street, prior to his going to RADA, where he remained Patron until his death. Attenborough's fist major credited role was provided in Brian Desmond Hurst's The Hundred Pound Window (1944) playing Tommy Draper who helps rescue his accountant father who has taken a wrong turn in life. Attenborough's film career had, however, began in 1942 in an uncredited role as a sailor deserting his post under fire in the Noël Coward/David Lean production In Which <b>We</b> <b>Serve</b> (his name and character were accidentally omitted from the original release-print credits), a role which would help to type-cast him for many years as a spiv or coward in films like London Belongs to Me (1948), Morning Departure (1950) and his breakthrough role as Pinkie Brown in John Boulting's film adaptation of Graham Greene's novel Brighton Rock (1947), a part that he had previously played to great acclaim at the Garrick Theatre in 1942.|$|E

25|$|Channel 3 {{signed on}} October 6, 1953 as WSVA-TV (for <b>We</b> <b>Serve</b> Virginia Agriculture). It {{was owned by}} Frederick L. Allman and his Shenandoah Valley Broadcasting Corporation along with WSVA radio (AM 550 and FM 100.7, now WQPO). The station was a primary NBC affiliate, with {{secondary}} CBS and ABC affiliations. The station also carried DuMont programs. It was the only commercial station between Richmond and Roanoke until WVIR-TV signed on from Charlottesville in 1973. Although it was owned by one of Virginia's leading broadcasters, WSVA-TV operated on a shoestring budget. Station engineers switched {{to and from the}} signals of the three network affiliates in Washington, D.C. because it was unable to afford direct network feeds. The station did not air any locally produced programs (except for local newscasts) until 1956, when it built a studio along U.S. Route 33 in unincorporated Rockingham County. That year, Allman sold the WSVA stations to Transcontinent Television of Buffalo, New York, with NBC executive Hamilton Shea as a minority partner. Allman earned a handsome return on his original investment of 21 years earlier. In 1959, the Washington Evening Star, owner of WMAL AM-FM-TV in Washington, acquired Transcontinent's controlling interest, as well as 1% of Shea's stake. The CBS affiliation was dropped in 1963.|$|E

500|$|The first popular Allied war films {{made during}} the Second World War came from Britain and {{combined}} the functions of documentary and propaganda.

The British film industry began to combine documentary techniques with fictional stories in films like Noël Coward and David Lean's In Which <b>We</b> <b>Serve</b> (1942) – [...] "the most successful British film of the war years", Millions Like Us (1943), and The Way Ahead (1944).|$|E

500|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War Coward volunteered for war work, running the British propaganda office in Paris. He also worked with the Secret Service, seeking to use his influence to persuade the American public and government to help Britain. Coward won an Academy Honorary Award in 1943 for his naval film drama, In Which <b>We</b> <b>Serve,</b> and was knighted in 1969. In the 1950s he achieved fresh success as a cabaret performer, performing his own songs, such as [...] "Mad Dogs and Englishmen", [...] "London Pride" [...] and [...] "I Went to a Marvellous Party".|$|E
500|$|Because of its November 1942 release, the New York Film Critics {{decided to}} include the film in its 1942 award season for best picture. Casablanca lost to In Which <b>We</b> <b>Serve.</b> However, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences stated that since the film went into {{national}} release {{in the beginning of}} 1943, it would be included in that year's nominations. Casablanca was nominated for eight Academy Awards, and won three. As Bogart stepped out of his car at the Academy Awards ceremony, [...] "the crowd surged forward, almost engulfing him and his wife, Mayo Methot. It took 12 police officers to rescue the two, and a red-faced, startled, yet smiling Bogart heard a chorus of cries of 'good luck' and 'here's looking at you, kid' as he was rushed into the theater." ...|$|E
500|$|Churchill's {{view was}} that Coward would do more for the war effort by {{entertaining}} the troops and the home front than by intelligence work: [...] "Go and sing to them when the guns are firing – that's your job!" [...] Coward, though disappointed, followed this advice. He toured, acted and sang indefatigably in Europe, Africa, Asia and America. He wrote and recorded war-themed popular songs, including [...] "London Pride" [...] and [...] "Don't Let's Be Beastly to the Germans". His London home was wrecked by German bombs in 1941, and he took up temporary residence at the Savoy Hotel. During one air raid on {{the area around the}} Savoy he joined Carroll Gibbons and Judy Campbell in impromptu cabaret to distract the captive guests from their fears. Another of Coward's wartime projects, as writer, star, composer and co-director (alongside David Lean), was the naval film drama In Which <b>We</b> <b>Serve.</b> The film was popular {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic, and he was awarded an honorary certificate of merit at the 1943 Academy Awards ceremony. Coward played a naval captain, basing the character on his friend Lord Louis Mountbatten. Lean went on to direct and adapt film versions of several Coward plays.|$|E

500|$|Numerous {{books and}} films have taken war at sea as their subject, often dealing with real or fictionalised {{incidents}} in the Second World War. Nicholas Monsarrat's 1951 novel The Cruel Sea follows {{the lives of a}} group of Royal Navy sailors fighting the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II; it was made into a 1952 film of the same name. The novelist Herman Wouk, reviewing [...] "five best nautical yarns", writes that [...] "The Cruel Sea was a major best seller and became a hit movie starring Jack Hawkins. Its authenticity is unmistakable... His description of a torpedoed crew, terrified, clinging to life rafts in the blackest of nights, is, indeed, too authoritative for comfort—we soon feel ourselves in that sea." [...] Anthony Asquith used a dramatised documentary style in his 1943 film We Dive at Dawn, while Noël Coward and David Lean's 1942 In Which <b>We</b> <b>Serve</b> combined information with drama. Pat Jackson's 1944 Western Approaches was, unusually for the time, shot in Technicolor, at sea in rough weather and sometimes actually in battle. Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's 1956 The Battle of the River Plate tells a tale of [...] "gentlemanly gallantry" [...] of the scuttling of the Admiral Graf Spee. A very different message, of [...] "duplicitous diplomacy [...] flawed intelligence" [...] is the theme of Richard Fleischer, Toshio Masuda and Kinji Fukasaku's $22 million epic Tora! Tora! Tora!
