The solubility of high molecular weight paraffins in naphthenic, aromatic or paraffinic solvents is very low and decreases rapidly with decreasing temperature. This property of the paraffins leads {{to the formation of}} gels of complex morphology that deposit on the cold walls of the subsea pipelines during the flow of <b>waxy</b> <b>crudes.</b> This deposition reduces the pipe diameter and decreases the flow capacity of the pipe. These wax-oil gels contain a large fraction of oil trapped in a 3 -D network structure of the wax crystals that behaves as a porous medium. After the incipient gel is formed, wax molecules continue to diffuse into this structure, thereby increasing its wax content. A model system of wax and oil mixture was used to understand the aging process of the wax-oil gels, which hardens the wax deposit with time. To understand the physics of the aging process for incipient thin-film deposits, a series of laboratory flow loop experiments was performed. The aging process was a counterdiffusion phenomenon with a critical carbon number above which wax molecules diffuse into the gel deposit and below which oil molecules diffuse out of the deposit. The aging rate of the gel deposit depends on the oil flow rate and the wall temperature. A mathematical model developed predicted the growth and wax content of the gel deposit on externally cooled pipe walls. The theory agreed with experiments excellently for thin gels...|$|R

Approximately, 20 % of the world oil reserves are <b>waxy</b> <b>crude</b> oil {{and half of the}} recoverable oil reserves are heavy crude oil (Ghannam et al. 2012; Kumar et al. 2015). One of the frequently encountered problems in unconventional oils is the presence of high paraffin wax content (Lira-Galeana and Hammami 2000). Precipitation and deposition of wax on the walls of production pipelines begin when the temperature of bulk oil falls below its wax appearance temperature (WAT). During the transportation of crude oil in the subsea region, where the average temperature can be as low as 5  °C near the seabed, the liquid-phase <b>waxy</b> <b>crude</b> oil undergoes three phase changes (Chala et al. 2018). With the change in the operating conditions (temperature and/or pressure), the wax particles aggregate within the cluster (Ganeeva et al. 2016). When the size of the clusters is large enough, the wax precipitates. The last stage is the gelation of a wax layer, whereby the wax molecules constantly deposit layer-wise and finally lead to a clogging gel that may result in a complete shutdown of production pipeline systems. Therefore, managing wax precipitation and deposition in production has become a major challenge in the oil and gas industry.|$|E

Here, from a previous set of data at a local scale {{with the help of}} Magnetic Resonance Imaging and a new full set of data for various flow and temperature histories, we give a general picture of the rheological behavior of <b>waxy</b> <b>crude</b> oils. The tests include start flow tests at different velocities or creep tests at different stress levels, abrupt changes of velocity level, steady flow, after cooling under static or flowing conditions. We show that when the fluid has been cooled at rest it forms a structure that irreversibly collapses during the startup flow.

Moreover, constant shear rate, constant shear stress, dynamic shear rate, dynamic shear stress, oscillatory, and extensional rheological experiments are performed to investigate the rheological properties of waxy oil samples. Two types of rheological models are established as follows: strain dependent model for stress prediction, strain dependent model for viscosity prediction. Shear history dependent rheological model and gel breakdown kinetics are also discussed in this thesis. Furthermore, wax inhibitor is investigated for industrial applications. Effect of wax inhibitor on wax appearance temperature, gelation point, viscosity, and yield stress are investigated. New polymer/ionic liquid based additive is investigated. The ionic liquid based additive has potential scientific, economic and environment friendly benefits for oil industry. Experimental results show that the conventional ionic liquid can change the oil property significantly, the property of which can be utilized in some branches of oil industry.

Understanding the behavior of crude oil-water flow in a pipe is crucial to many engineering applications, such as design and operation of flow lines and wells, separation systems, logs interpretations, and determination {{of the amount of}} free water in contact with the wall of the pipes that could render erosion or corrosion problems. Presently, there is no two phase flow study done on the Malaysian <b>waxy</b> <b>crude</b> oil-water. Therefore, a research work was conducted at the UTM-MPRC Institute for Oil and Gas, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, to study the flow pattern, pressure drop, and water holdup of the Malaysian <b>waxy</b> <b>crude</b> oil-water flowing in a closed-loop system at an ambient condition through a 5. 08 cm ID stainless steel horizontal pipeline. In the research work, water cuts were varied from 0 % - 90 % with mixture velocities ranging from 0. 1 – 0. 8 m/s. The research works comprised fluid characterization, flow pattern observation using a video camera camcorder, pressure drop, and liquid holdup measurement. Five flow patterns have been identified, namely stratified wavy flow, stratified wavy with semi dispersed flow at interface and oil film, dispersion of water in oil and oil continuous with emulsion, dispersion of oil in water with water continuous, and the newly found semi dispersed flow with semi emulsion at interface and thin oil film. The investigations proved that pressure drop was greatly influenced by flow pattern and mixture velocity. It was also found that the water holdup decreased slightly at higher water cuts due to the presence of emulsion in the crude oil – a great challenge when using a <b>waxy</b> <b>crude</b> oil in a two phase flow system. The experimental results {{could be used as a}} platform to understand better a more complex case of gas, oil, and water concurrent flow in a pipelin...|$|E

In this work, a new approach based on the wax appearance temperature of crude oil was proposed to estimate PC-SAFT parameters in thermodynamic modeling of wax precipitation from crude oil. The proposed approach was verified using experimental data obtained in this work and also with those reported in the literature. In order to compare {{the performance of the}} PC-SAFT model with previous models, the wax precipitation experimental data were correlated using previous models such as the solid solution model and multi-solid phase model. The results showed that the PC-SAFT model can correlate more accurately the wax precipitation experimental data of crude oil than the previous models, with an absolute average deviation less than 0.4  %. Also, a series of dynamic experiments were carried out to determine the rheological behavior of <b>waxy</b> <b>crude</b> oil in the absence and presence of a flow improver such as ethylene–vinyl acetate copolymer. It was found that the apparent viscosity of <b>waxy</b> <b>crude</b> oil decreased with increasing shear rate. Also, the results showed that the performance of flow improver was dependent on its molecular weight.|$|E

Two pilot tests of ASP and SAP flooding have been successful in China. The one (SAP) is in Daqing Oil Field for <b>waxy</b> <b>crude</b> oil of low acid (Gao et al. 1996), and the other (ASP) is in Shengli Oil Field for the high acid oil (Song et al. 1995; Krumrine et al. 1983).|$|E
