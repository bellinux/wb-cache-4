40|$|At its {{inception}} the juvenile court {{was characterized by}} procedural informality and individualized, offender-oriented dispositions. Subsequent to the U. S. Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 7 Gault 2 ̆ 7 decision, which mandated procedural safeguards in the adjudication of delinquency, juvenile court procedures became more formal {{in the interest of}} protecting the rights of juveniles, but individualized, offender-oriented dispositions were preserved. The inability of proponents of juvenile rehabilitation to demonstrate the effectiveness of parens patriae intervention, however, has led an increasing number of States to incorporate 2 ̆ 7 just deserts 2 ̆ 7 sentencing principles in their juvenile justice systems. This emphasis is evidenced in the waiver of juvenile offenders for criminal prosecution that will presumably match the disposition to the crime 2 ̆ 7 s severity. Proponents of just deserts in sentencing contend that there is no reliable clinical basis upon which juvenile court judges can make accurate amenability or dangerousness determinations and that the standardless discretion afforded juvenile court judges results in the inconsistent application of juvenile court waivers. This article examines legislation that has sought to standardize the <b>waiver</b> <b>decision.</b> The implications of waiver for juveniles and justice are discussed.

40|$|Waiver {{legislation}} in Minnesota, {{as in most}} other States, typically requires juvenile court judges to make individualized determinations as to a juvenile 2 ̆ 7 s amenability to treatment and danger to society {{as the basis for}} deciding whether to transfer the juvenile to adult court for disposition. Disposition in adult court allows for a more severe sanction than that permitted under the maximum sentence that can be dispensed in juvenile court.

Little is known about juveniles subject to long-term incarceration and the legal decision making that creates the conditions and length of their imprisonment. Although there is an emerging body of research on the front end of waiver that draws on theories of sentencing, there is little research on postsentencing decisions. Research on the back end of waiver is needed to understand the effect of transferring juveniles to criminal court. Legal decision making at the back end of waiver can be understood in terms of the jurisdictional context of organizational knowledge.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the role of}} audit verification in the resolution process following debt covenant violations. Using two sets of proxies for demand-audit fees and the independence and diligence of audit committees-we find evidence that covenant violations result in a demand for differentially higher levels of audit verification. Further analyses demonstrate {{the link between the}} increased demand for audit verification and the mechanisms designed to control agency costs in debt contracts. We document cross-sectional variations in the observed fee differential with respect to the level of reliance on financial covenants, the type of covenants violated, and <b>waiver</b> <b>decisions.</b> Moreover, we find that the observed audit fee increases are associated with more favorable movements in borrowing costs and the adoption of more conservative investment policies post violation. Our findings suggest that covenant violations increase the demand for audit services to help control contracting costs post violation.

40|$|Millions of {{custodial}} suspects waive {{their rights}} each year {{without the benefit}} of legal counsel. The question posed to psychologists in disputed Miranda waivers is whether this <b>waiver</b> <b>decision</b> was, knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. Mental health professionals must be aware of potential barriers to Miranda comprehension to provide expert opinions regarding a defendant's competency to waive rights. The current study examined how Miranda warning reading level, length, and method of administration affects Miranda comprehension. Recently arrested detainees at Grayson County Jail were administered oral and written Miranda warnings from the Miranda Statements Scale (MSS; Rogers, 2005) to measure their comprehension of the warnings. Surprisingly low levels of Miranda comprehension were found for most warnings. For all warnings at or above 8 th grade, a substantial minority (27. 1 % - 39. 6 %) of defendants exhibited failed (i. e., < 50 % understanding) Miranda comprehension. Regardless of other variables, oral administrations resulted in a substantially larger number of defendants with failed Miranda comprehension.

40|$|This {{entry into}} force of the World Trade Organization (WTO) TRIPS Agreement in 1995 {{transformed}} the international intellectual property system. The harmonization of basic intellectual property standards has operated to protect investment in innovation, limiting risks from unjustified 2 ̆ 7 free riding. 2 ̆ 7 Yet these same harmonized IP standards sharply curtailed the traditional capacity of suppliers of public goods, {{such as health care}} and nutrition, to address the priority needs of less affluent members of society, particularly in (but not limited to) developing countries. In the Doha Declaration, the <b>Waiver</b> <b>Decision</b> of 30 August 2003 and the Article 31 bis Protocol of Amendment, stakeholders concerned with re-opening policy space for the supply of newer pharmaceutical products pushed back against the restrictive elements of the TRIPS Agreement. Governments around the world {{are in the process of}} deciding whether to ratify and accept the Article 31 bis Amendment. Based on their Study for the International Trade Committee of the European Parliament, the authors argue that acceptance of the Amendment will provide a 2 ̆ 7 net benefit 2 ̆ 7 for countries seeking to improve access to medicines. At the insistence of WTO delegations acting on behalf of the originator pharmaceutical industry lobby, Article 31 bis regrettably is saddled with unnecessary administrative hurdles. Nonetheless, through skillful lawyering, political determination and coordinated planning, the system can be made to work. Among other options, expeditious back-to-back compulsory licensing linked with pooled procurement strategies may effectively achieve economies of scale in production and distribution of medicines. The authors doubt that the international political environment would support renegotiation of an 2 ̆ 7 improved 2 ̆ 7 solution. They express concern that failure to bring the Amendment into force will open the door to a campaign to undermine the <b>Waiver</b> <b>Decision.</b> Recent events in Brazil and Thailand illustrate both the opportunities and risks associated with implementing TRIPS exception mechanisms, and help to inform views on the negotiating environment. Specific proposals for regional cooperation in implementing the Amendment are laid out, and the authors emphasize the importance of pursuing concrete transfer of technology measures in support of developing country pharmaceutical manufacturing. Over-reliance on private market mechanisms for the supply of public health goods leaves the international community with an unresolved collective action problem on a large scale...|$|E
40|$|In May 2003, the WTO {{granted a}} waiver for trade {{restrictions}} imposed on WTO members not {{participating in the}} Kimberley Certification Scheme combating so-called 2 ̆ 2 conflict diamonds. 2 ̆ 2 This Article examines {{the implications of this}} <b>waiver</b> <b>decision.</b> It argues that GATT/TBT provisions may already excuse the trade restrictions at issue, especially now that the UN Security Council has explicitly supported them. The waiver, therefore, risks sending out the wrong signals, confirming a WTO 2 ̆ 2 superiority complex. 2 ̆ 2 At the same time, by excluding restrictions between Kimberley participants from its scope, the waiver implies that WTO members considered the Kimberley scheme to be a non-WTO instrument that could play a role before a WTO panel. This convergence of the WTO treaty with other instruments of international law must be applauded. Yet, the same result could have been achieved by other, more conciliatory means, such as an interpretative decision.

40|$|Each year, an {{estimated}} 318, 000 defendants {{who do not}} comprehend the Miranda warnings waive their rights and provide incriminating evidence without the protection of counsel (Rogers, 2008), which make Miranda-related competencies {{one of the most}} pervasive pretrial issues. A wide range of issues could potentially affect an individual's capacity to provide a knowing and intelligent waiver. Previous Miranda research has focused narrowly on the effects of cognitive and developmental factors. The current study added to the Miranda literature by examining the impact of two highly prevalent conditions found in correctional populations, attention deficits and substance abuse. Adult defendants in custody (N = 118) were evaluated within 36 hours of arrest in order to assess both chronic psychological disorders and situational variables. Results indicate that attention deficits {{have a significant impact on}} defendants' ability to provide a knowing Miranda waiver, whereas substance use profoundly affected their reasoning about Miranda <b>waiver</b> <b>decisions.</b> This study represents the first systematic investigation of the effect of transient mental states on Miranda-related abilities with criminal defendants.

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Emissions from mobile sources, such as automobiles and trucks, contribute to air quality degradation and can threaten {{public health and the}} environment. Under the Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates these emissions. The act generally allows one set of federal standards for new motor vehicle emissions and pre-empts states from adopting or enforcing their own standards. However, it also authorizes the EPA Administrator to waive this provision to allow the state of California 1 to enact and enforce emission standards for new motor vehicles that are as protective, in the aggregate, as federal government standards. Other states may also adopt California's standards if they choose. The waiver provision was added to the Federal Air Quality Act (one of the precursors of the current Clean Air Act) in 1967 because of California's severe air pollution problems and because the state had already established its own emission standards for mobile sources. California has used this waiver provision regularly to establish and enforce standards for vehicle emissions more stringent than those required by federal law. However, California must request a waiver of federal pre-emption and the EPA Administrator must approve it before California or any other state can implement such standards. Since being given this authority, California has requested and been granted waivers more than 50 times. In December 2005, California requested a waiver from EPA to allow it to regulate motor vehicle emissions of greenhouse gases, which are closely linked to global climate change. At the time, EPA was responding to litigation initiated by environmental groups and state and local governments regarding whether greenhouse gas emissions were air pollutants that the agency had authority to regulate under the Clean Air Act. EPA delayed action on California's waiver request pending the outcome of that litigation. On April 2, 2007, the U. S. Supreme Court decided the question in Massachusetts v. EPA by holding that EPA did have the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless, on December 19, 2007, the EPA Administrator announced his intent to deny California's request. The Administrator subsequently formalized the denial in a decision document he signed and EPA published in the Federal Register on March 6, 2008. The decision has received a high level of attention for a number of reasons. For example, it departed in certain respects from EPA's previous waiver determinations [...] {{it was the first time}} that EPA denied a formal waiver request outright, and it also was the first time EPA used the "compelling and extraordinary conditions" criterion in the Clean Air Act as the basis for denying a waiver request. Due to the atypical outcome of EPA's decision regarding California's greenhouse gas waiver request, Congress asked GAO to review the decision to deny the waiver. As agreed with Congressional offices, we focused our work on the process for and outcomes of past waiver requests because the greenhouse gas <b>waiver</b> <b>decision</b> is the subject of ongoing litigation. Thus, we did not seek to examine the basis for the greenhouse gas decision itself or the process EPA used in reviewing this waiver request. This report summarizes the information about prior waiver requests and decisions provided to Congressional staff during our November 21, 2008, briefing. ...|$|E
40|$|Politics of {{education}} researchers have long recognized {{the role of}} micropolitics in school decision-making processes. We argue that investigating micropolitical dynamics is key to an important set of school decisions that are fundamental to inequities in access to high-quality teachers: assignments of teachers and students to classrooms. Focusing on the intraorganizational political power of experienced teachers, our analysis of survey and administrative data from a large urban district suggests that more experienced teachers have more influence over which students are assigned to their classrooms. By a variety measures, we also find that more experienced teachers are assigned fewer disadvantaged students, on average, a pattern inconsistent with goals of ameliorating educational inequality by matching more qualified teachers with the students who need them most. Improving the school performance of students from traditionally disadvantaged backgrounds and closing achievement gaps with more advantaged students {{are among the most}} important challenges of modern educational reform. Recognition of the importance of teacher quality for student achievement (Harris & Sass, 2011; Nye, Konstantopoulos, & Hedges, 2004; Rivkin, Hanushek, & Kain, 2005; Rockoff, 2004) has focused recent policy efforts aimed at these goals on inequities in the distribution of effective teachers. As one recent example, in July, 2014, Secretary of Education Arne Duncan unveiled the Department of Education’s “ 50 State Strategy ” for ensuring that students of color and from low-income backgrounds have equitable access to qualified teachers as part of future No Child Left Behind <b>waiver</b> renewal <b>decisions</b> (Klein, 2014). Attention on teacher equity from both policymakers and researchers, however, has focused primarily on the distribution of teachers across schools (Lankford, Loeb, & Wyckoff, 2002). Yet some evidence is beginning to accumulate that teacher quality is also inequitably 2 distributed within schools, with students from less advantaged backgrounds more likely to be placed in classrooms with less qualified or less effective teachers (Clotfelter, Ladd, & Vigdor...|$|R

We {{assess the impact of}} welfare reform <b>waivers</b> on those <b>decisions</b> while controlling for confounding local economic and social contextual conditions. We pool the 1990, 1992, and 1993 panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) which span the calendar time when many states began adopting welfare waivers. For its descriptors of local labor market conditions, the project uses skill specific measures of wages and employment opportunities for counties. We estimate models for levels of female headship and proportional hazard models for entry and exit from female headship. In the hazards, we employ stratified Cox partial likelihood methods and investigate the use of state fixed effects or state stratified hazard models to control for unmeasured state influences. Based on data through 1995, we find limited evidence that workencouraging waivers had a beneficial effect by reducing female headship of families. We find little evidence that family caps, teenage coresidence requirements or termination limits will reduce the number of single-parent families.

40|$|Background: Informed consent is {{an ethical}} {{practice}} {{that should be}} guaranteed before a child {{is involved in a}} research. The position of the child in research has also become a subject of debate with regards to ethics. Though many countries may have unique provisions for conducting research with children, it is the goal of every regulatory mechanism to guarantee the autonomy, rights and protection of children in research.   Discussion: The form in which the information about a research is presented to a child can either weaken or strengthen the capacity of child to provide informed consent. The Medical Research Council suggests that many children would be competent to give consent if the information about the study is provided in an appropriate form and they are helped through the process of decision-making. It is ethically unacceptable to exclude children with cognitive challenges or learning disabilities from research based on their condition. Any research with children should be designed to integrate children with these forms of condition, except it is vital to exclude them. Even when the capacity of a child to provide informed consent is apparent, it is good ethical practice to involve the parents of the child in the decision making process especially for a research that carries any form of risk or discomfort. Notwithstanding this position, researchers always face challenges with obtaining active parental consent. Parental consent waiver is one of the options for dealing with the challenges associated with obtaining active parental consent. Most times parental <b>waiver</b> is a <b>decision</b> reached at recruitment points where a child with capacity to give informed consent insists that his or her parents should not be informed if he or she would participate in the research. Summary: It is now clear that researchers must seek to position a child as one who can make informed choices. These emerging perspectives should support the selection of design, methodology and intervention for children with a goal to strengthen their capacity and autonomy to give informed consent...|$|R
