Now he's become charming. But he knows a lot, that's the problem. When <b>we</b> <b>worked</b> <b>together</b> {{it was my first}} film up and I was the new kid on the block. But we made a good movie." [...] Ford said of Scott in 2000: [...] "I admire his work. We had a bad patch there, and I'm over it." [...] In 2006 Ford {{reflected}} on the production of the film saying: [...] "What I remember more than anything else when I see Blade Runner is not the 50 nights of shooting in the rain, but the voiceover... I was still obliged to work for these clowns that came in writing one bad voiceover after another." [...] Ridley Scott confirmed in the summer 2007 issue of Total Film that Harrison Ford contributed to the Blade Runner Special Edition DVD, and had already recorded his interviews. [...] "Harrison's fully on board", said Scott.|$|E
500|$|Jayma Mays commented {{of their}} relationship: [...] "Oh no! I don’t know if I can say! That’s a hard {{question}} {{because when you}} see the scenes of Emma and Will, you obviously think 'Oh of course they’re supposed to be together, of course, of course!' but the fact is, is that he’s a married man and Emma knows that’s wrong, and she doesn’t want to be a homewrecker. She doesn’t want to ruin a relationship. So I guess in a perfect world, she could find someone like Will, or maybe Ken Tanaka (laughs) can become a little bit more like Will. But maybe it’s all about respect. Maybe if she can respect Ken enough, that will develop into true love." [...] She also commented of her co-star Matthew Morrison (Will): [...] "We were friends. We knew each other before we started this job. <b>We</b> <b>worked</b> <b>together</b> once before. So, that’s always helpful when you know the person that you’re working with, and you already feel comfortable around them. But yeah, he’s a really good friend, so that makes that stuff a little bit easier." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1991 Sondheim {{worked with}} Terrence McNally on a musical, All Together Now. McNally said, [...] "Steve was {{interested}} in {{telling the story of}} a relationship from the present back to the moment when the couple first met. <b>We</b> <b>worked</b> <b>together</b> a while, but we were both involved with so many other projects that this one fell through". The story follows Arden Scott, a 30-something female sculptor, and Daniel Nevin (a slightly-younger, sexually attractive restaurateur). Its script, with concept notes by McNally and Sondheim, is archived in the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin.|$|E

Few details of their relationship or its end were made public. In It's Always Something, this is the one reference Radner made to Murray in the entire book: [...] "All the guys [...] liked to have me around because I would laugh at them till I peed in my pants and tears rolled out of my eyes. <b>We</b> <b>worked</b> <b>together</b> {{for a couple of years}} creating The National Lampoon Show, writing The National Lampoon Radio Hour, and even working on stuff for the magazine.

2500|$|Baker {{described}} {{working with}} Michael E. Knight (Tad Martin) and Eakes as a fun but somewhat intimidating experience. [...] "They are naturals at it!" [...] she stated. She said that Eakes helped her {{feel more comfortable}} during her first few weeks as Babe, {{and to get a}} better understanding of the character. [...] "She came up to me the first day <b>we</b> <b>worked</b> <b>together</b> and offered to go over lines together and help me with anything I needed. She is a sweetheart," [...] said Baker. Baker revealed that in her spare time in between takes as the character, she managed to find something to keep entertained by. [...] "It seems like there is always something to do when you have down time on the set," [...] she said. [...] "I either run lines with the other actors or hang out in the hair and makeup room. I love those ladies!" [...] Adding to Baker's enjoyment on the set was Young. [...] "He is always cracking jokes!" [...] stated Baker.|$|E

2500|$|So {{that the}} distractions {{of a busy}} life should not {{interfere}} with Head's introspective analysis, {{it was decided that}} the experimentation should take place in Rivers's rooms. Here, as Head states, [...] "for five happy years <b>we</b> <b>worked</b> <b>together</b> on week-ends and holidays in the quiet atmosphere of his rooms at St. John's College." [...] In the normal course of events, Head would travel to Cambridge on Saturday, after spending several hours on the outpatient department of the London Hospital. On these occasions, however, he would find that he was simply too exhausted to work on the Saturday evening so experimentation would have to be withheld until the Sunday. If, therefore, a long series of tests were to be carried out, Head would come to Cambridge on the Friday, returning to London on Monday morning. At some points, usually during Rivers's vacation period, longer periods could be devoted to the observations. Between the date of the operation and their last sitting on 13 December 1907, 167days were devoted to the investigation.|$|E

2500|$|Dev Anand is {{credited}} with giving actors like Zarina Wahab in Ishq Ishq Ishq, Jackie Shroff in Swami Dada, Tabu in Hum Naujawan and Richa Sharma (Sanjay Dutt’s first wife) {{a break in the}} film industry, discovering Zeenat Amaan, Tina Munim and encouraging music composer Rajesh Roshan. Amit Khanna started his career with Navketan as executive producer in 1971 and had been secretary to Dev Anand in the 1970s. He adds, [...] "The uniqueness of Navketan today is that it's the only film company in the world still run by the one who started it." [...] Shatrughan Sinha disclosed in an interview that it was Dev Anand who gave him a break in films by giving him a role in [...] "Prem Pujari" [...] and since Dev had given Sinha a very small role in that film, he compensated for it by giving Sinha another role in his next film 'Gambler'. Sinha quoted [...] "Later on <b>we</b> <b>worked</b> <b>together</b> in 'Sharif Badmash' and it was really a privilege to work with him". It was under Dev Anand's Navketan Banner where Guru Dutt, Raj Khosla, Waheeda Rehman, S.D. Burman, Jaidev, Sahir Ludhianvi, Majrooh Sultanpuri, Yash Johar, Shekhar Kapur and Kabir Bedi were given breaks into Hindi films and Dev launched actors Zaheera, Zaheeda Hussain, Zarina Wahab, Natasha Sinha, Ekta Sohini and Sabrina.|$|E

Year 2011 is certainly a bad year for dictators. We pray that God also calls to heaven the few remaining ones". The larger faction of the Movement for Democratic Change – Tsvangirai stated that “Kim Jong- il killed our loved ones and now it is his time to meet his victims in the presence of God”, and a spokesperson for the larger faction added “his party won’t shed a tear for the North Korean dictator and he should rot in hell”.|$|E
