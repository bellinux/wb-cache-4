It was rebuilt by British soldiers, and logically took {{the name of the}} English bridge. Again destroyed during World War II, the bridge was rebuilt in 1950 as a footbridge.The covered market, built in 1908 by architect Albert-Désiré Guilbert (1866-1949).|$|R

30|$|In this study, we set {{the value}} of each {{parameter}} in Fig. 4 based on an article which reported the anthropometry of Asian eyelids [13]. According to this article, the <b>width</b> <b>between</b> {{the upper and lower}} eyelids is 7.5 mm to 9.0 mm, and the <b>width</b> <b>between</b> the rail and inner corners of the eye is 20 mm to 30 mm. Based on these values, we set {{the value of}} each parameter to be 9 mm < H < 10 mm, L = 42 mm, and ψ = 40 ^∘.|$|R
40|$|For {{morphological}} {{characterization of}} the udder of «Merino Beira Baixa» ewes (double aptitude), from centre interior of Portugal, 4 series of measurements were performed with 3 weeks intervals, {{since the beginning of}} milking (57 • 7 days after lambing). We have observed the next parameters: length, width, volume and posterior area of udder; <b>width</b> <b>between</b> teats and their relative positions, the angle between the teats and the vertical axis, length and width of teats; cisternal width. Daily milk production represents about 80 % of the udder volume and the correlation coeficient for these parameters (r= 0. 54), was the highest one founded. Observed coeficient correlation between daily milk production and <b>width</b> <b>between</b> teats was r= 0. 53. All studied variables (morphological characteristics), explain 38, 13 % of milk production variabi¬lity. Udder volume and <b>width</b> <b>between</b> teats explain 37. 99 % of the same variability. Results suggest that udder morphology of «Merino Beira Baixa» ewes is a weak indicator of animal’s milk value...|$|R
