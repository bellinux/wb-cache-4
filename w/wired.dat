Firstly, the decrease of <b>wire</b> diameter due to abrasion causes a slow loss of <b>wire</b> tension along the whole <b>wire</b> web.

5000|$|In {{electrical}} <b>wiring,</b> a T-splice is a splice that is {{used for}} connecting {{the end of one}} <b>wire</b> to the middle of another <b>wire,</b> thus forming a shape like that of the letter [...] "T." [...] This splice can be used with solid or stranded <b>wires.</b> The existing <b>wire</b> is called the main <b>wire.</b> The new <b>wire</b> that connects to the main <b>wire</b> is called the branch <b>wire</b> or tap <b>wire.</b> [...] This is a prevalent junction type used in knob and tube <b>wiring.</b>|$|R
5|$|Despite {{the modest}} {{popularity}} of IBM Token Ring in the 1980s and 1990s, virtually all LANs now use either <b>wired</b> or wireless Ethernet facilities. At the physical layer, most <b>wired</b> Ethernet implementations use copper twisted-pair cables (including the common 10BASE-T networks). However, some early implementations used heavier coaxial cables and some recent implementations (especially high-speed ones) use optical fibers. When optic fibers are used, the distinction {{must be made}} between multimode fibers and single-mode fibers. Multimode fibers {{can be thought of}} as thicker optical fibers that are cheaper to manufacture devices for, but that suffers from less usable bandwidth and worse attenuation – implying poorer long-distance performance.|$|E

50|$|Solid <b>wire,</b> {{also called}} solid-core or single-strand <b>wire,</b> {{consists}} of {{one piece of}} metal <b>wire.</b> Solid <b>wire</b> is useful for <b>wiring</b> breadboards. Solid <b>wire</b> is cheaper to manufacture than stranded <b>wire</b> and is used where there is little need for flexibility in the <b>wire.</b> Solid <b>wire</b> also provides mechanical ruggedness; and, because it has relatively less surface area which is exposed to attack by corrosives, protection against the environment.|$|R
50|$|A braided <b>wire</b> is {{composed}} {{of a number of}} small strands of <b>wire</b> braided together. Similar to stranded <b>wires,</b> braided <b>wires</b> are better conductors than solid <b>wires.</b> Braided <b>wires</b> do not break easily when flexed. Braided <b>wires</b> are often suitable as an electromagnetic shield in noise-reduction cables.|$|R

Piled around the cart were silverware and a metal cash box. Ashes of several bank notes could be seen through a slit in the cash box. Kehoe had placed and <b>wired</b> homemade pyrotol firebombs in the house and all the buildings of the farm.

50|$|A barbed <b>wire</b> {{steel cage}} match {{is one of}} any number of matches that uses strands of barbed <b>wire</b> in some capacity. Simply using barbed <b>wire</b> in an {{otherwise}} regular steel cage match {{does not make the}} match a barbed <b>wire</b> steel cage match; the barbed <b>wire</b> must be part of the match's design. Another variations are the Razor <b>Wire</b> Steel Cage Match, a similar concept to that of the barbed <b>wire</b> cage match, however the barbed <b>wire</b> is replaced by razor <b>wire</b> and is wrapped around the top, corners, and walls of the cage, and Barbed <b>wire</b> Razor <b>wire</b> Steel Cage match {{is the same as the}} barbed <b>wire</b> cage match, however the top, corners, and walls of the cage are covered with barbed <b>wire,</b> further covered with razor <b>wire.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{very simple}} <b>wiring</b> systems, the fault {{location}} is often found through {{inspection of the}} <b>wires.</b> In complex <b>wiring</b> systems (for example, aircraft <b>wiring)</b> where the <b>wires</b> may be hidden, <b>wiring</b> faults are located with a Time-domain reflectometer. [...] The time domain reflectometer sends a pulse down the <b>wire</b> and then analyzes the returning reflected pulse to identify faults within the electrical <b>wire.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Wire</b> {{wrapping}} {{comes from}} the tradition of rope splicing. Early <b>wire</b> wrapping was performed manually; a slow and careful process. <b>Wire</b> wrapping was used for splices and for finishing cable ends in suspension bridge <b>wires</b> and other <b>wire</b> rope rigging, usually with a smaller diameter <b>wire</b> wrapped around a larger <b>wire</b> or bundle of <b>wires.</b> Such techniques were purely mechanical, to add strength or prevent fraying.|$|R

5|$|Thirty-two such modules {{were then}} stacked and <b>wired</b> {{together}} with a mass of twisted-pair wires into a single processor. The basic cycle time was 2.11ns, or 474MHz, allowing each processor to reach about 0.948 GFLOPS, and a 16 processor machine a theoretical 15.17 GFLOP. Key to the high performance was the high-speed access to main memory, which allowed each process to burst up to 8 GB/s.|$|E
5|$|Curtis Silver, in a {{retrospective}} for <b>Wired,</b> collected anecdotes from They Might Be Giants fans, {{many of whom}} were first exposed to the band through Flood. Silver concluded that new fans are drawn just as much to the band's old material as they are their more recent work, due to its sustaining accessibility. In fact, many fans cite the band's earliest albums as their favorites—though often not Flood, despite (or perhaps due to) its longstanding mainstream success.|$|E
30|$|Low-carbon steel <b>wires,</b> {{high-carbon}} steel <b>wires,</b> stainless steel <b>wires,</b> copper <b>wires,</b> aluminum <b>wires,</b> magnesium <b>wires,</b> gold <b>wires,</b> and amorphous <b>wires</b> {{have been used}} as materials for structures, medical devices, electrical devices, meshes, goods for hobby and so on (Yoshida 2000). These <b>wires</b> are required to be much finer than typical <b>wires,</b> because the weight reduction and miniaturization of various products has progressed. For example, gold <b>wires</b> less than 0.02  mm in diameter have been required because of decreasing spacing between bonding <b>wires.</b> Kim et al. investigated mechanical properties of ultra-fine Au <b>wires</b> {{for the development of a}} fine and high-strength Au <b>wire</b> (Kim et al. 2006). Daitoh et al. (Daitoh et al. 2000) and Tarui et al. (Tarui et al. 2005) developed the steel <b>wire</b> with a diameter of 0.02  mm and tensile strength higher than 4  GPa and investigated the microstructure of the <b>wire.</b> Furthermore, Li et al. succeeded in the development of ultra-fine steel <b>wire</b> with a diameter of 0.02  mm and tensile strength of 7  GPa (Li et al. 2014). However, ductility like an elongation of the <b>wire</b> was not measured sufficiently.|$|R
5000|$|Half-hard <b>wire</b> is {{slightly}} stiffer than dead soft <b>wire.</b> Half-hard <b>wire</b> is excellent for making tight, angular bends, for making loops in <b>wire,</b> and for wrapping <b>wire</b> around itself. However, {{it is not}} very useful for making spirals. Finished pieces made with half-hard <b>wire</b> are usually more permanent than pieces made with soft <b>wire.</b>|$|R
50|$|Jump <b>wires</b> (also called jumper <b>wires)</b> for {{solderless}} breadboarding can {{be obtained}} in ready-to-use jump <b>wire</b> sets or can be manually manufactured. The latter can become tedious work for larger circuits. Ready-to-use jump <b>wires</b> come in different qualities, some even with tiny plugs attached to the <b>wire</b> ends. Jump <b>wire</b> material for ready-made or homemade <b>wires</b> should usually be 22 AWG (0.33 mm2) solid copper, tin-plated <b>wire</b> - assuming no tiny plugs are to {{be attached to the}} <b>wire</b> ends. The <b>wire</b> ends should be stripped 3/16 to 5/16 in. Shorter stripped <b>wires</b> might result in bad contact with the board's spring clips (insulation being caught in the springs). Longer stripped <b>wires</b> increase the likelihood of short-circuits on the board. Needle-nose pliers and tweezers are helpful when inserting or removing <b>wires,</b> particularly on crowded boards.|$|R

50|$|EL <b>wire</b> sequencers can flash {{electroluminescent}} <b>wire,</b> or EL <b>wire,</b> in sequential patterns. EL <b>wire</b> {{requires a}} low-power, high-frequency driver {{to cause the}} <b>wire</b> to illuminate. Most EL <b>wire</b> drivers simply light up one strand of EL <b>wire</b> in a constant-on mode, and some drivers may additionally have a blink or strobe mode. A sound-activated driver will light EL <b>wire</b> in synchronization to music, speech, or other ambient sound, but an EL <b>wire</b> sequencer will allow multiple lengths of EL <b>wire</b> to be flashed in a desired sequence. The lengths of EL <b>wire</b> can all be the same color, or a variety of colors.|$|R
