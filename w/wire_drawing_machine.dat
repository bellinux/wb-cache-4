A theoretical consideration of the vibration of the equipment is included and compared with experimental data. Tests were performed on a 3000 lbf bull-block and the oscillatory energy was supplied in a longitudinal mode from a 3000 lbf electro-hydraulic oscillator. Equipment was designed to measure drawing force, drawing torque, amplitude of die and drum oscillation, and drawing speed. Frequencies of die oscillation in the range 0 - 125 Hz were studied with amplitudes up to 0. 070 in peak to peak. A study of process parameters, such as natural frequency of the system, damping of the bull-block drive, torsional oscillation of the drum, and die assembly inertia, showed that the analysis was in good agreement with experimental data and {{that it can be}} used to predict the effect of oscillations on the forces and torques acting during oscillatory wire drawing. Part 2 presents experimental data obtained from mild steel, hard aluminium, stainless steel and hard copper. Results show that there is no reduction in the peak drawing force and negligible reduction in the CO-efficient of friction. The results also confirm that oscillatory drawing is a mechanical process of straining and unstraining the drawn wire, and that the reduction in mean force can be determined by a mechanism of force superposition...|$|E
40|$|With the {{competitive}} challenge facing business today, {{the need to}} keep cost down and quality up is a matter of survival. One way in which wire manufacturers can meet this challenge is to possess a thorough understanding of deformation, friction and lubrication during the wire drawing process, and therefore to make good decisions regarding the selection and application of lubricants as well as the die design. Friction, lubrication and die design during wire drawing thus become the subject of this study. Although theoretical and experimental investigations have been being carried out ever since the establishment of wire drawing technology, many problems remain unsolved. It is therefore necessary to conduct further research on traditional and fundamental subjects such as the mechanics of deformation, friction, lubrication and die design in wire drawing. Drawing experiments were carried out on an existing bull-block under different cross-sectional area reductions, different speeds and different lubricants. The instrumentation to measure drawing load and drawing speed was set up and connected to the <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>machine,</b> together with a data acquisition system. A die box connected to the existing die holder for using dry soap lubricant was designed and tested. The experimental results in terms of drawing stress vs percentage area reduction curves under different drawing conditions were analysed and compared. The effects on drawing stress of friction, lubrication, drawing speed and pressure die nozzle are discussed. In order to determine the flow stress of the material during deformation, tensile tests were performed on an Instron universal test machine, using the wires drawn under different area reductions. A polynomial function is used to correlate the flow stress of the material with the plastic strain, on which a general computer program has been written to find out the coefficients of the stress-strain function. The residual lubricant film on the steel wire after drawing was examined both radially and longitudinally using an SEM and optical microscope. The lubricant film on the drawn wire was clearly observed. Therefore, the micro-analysis by SEM provides a way of friction and lubrication assessment in wire drawing...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. High speed multi pass wet <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> {{has become}} very common for {{production}} of high carbon steel cord because {{of the increase in}} customer demand and production rates in real industrial fields.

However, in the high carbon steel <b>wire</b> <b>drawing,</b> the <b>wire</b> temperature rises greatly as the drawing speed increase.

40|$|Eliminating a Major Cause of <b>Wire</b> <b>Drawing</b> Breakage in A- 15 High-Field Superconductors Phase 1 Summary Purpose of the research: The Phase 1 {{goal was}} to make a {{significant}} improvement in the <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> technology used for difficult to draw superconductor precursor composites. Many ductile Nb-Al and Nb-Sn precursor wire composites have experienced the onset of <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> breakage at about 1. 5 mm diameter. Phase 1 focused on evaluating the role that precision rigid guidance of the <b>wire</b> into the <b>drawing</b> die and the hydrostatic stress state at the die entrance played in preventing wire breakage. Research carried out: The research performed depended upon the construction of both a mechanical wire guide and a hydrostatic pressure stiffened wire guidance system. Innovare constructed the two wire guidance systems and tested them for their ability to reduce <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> breakage. One set of hardware provided rigid alignment of the wires to their <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> die axes within 0. 35 degrees using ''hydrostatic pressure stiffening'' to enable the precision guidance strategy to be implemented for these highly flexible small diameter wires. This apparatus was compared to a guide arrangement that used short span mechanical guide alignment with a misalignment limit of about 0. 75 degrees. Four A- 15 composite wires with breakage histories were drawn to evaluate the use of these wire guiding systems to reduce and/or eliminate wire breakage. Research findings and results: In Phase 1, a breakthrough in <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> technology for A- 15 superconductor composites was achieved by dramatically limiting or eliminating breakage in four different A- 15 composite precursor wire designs during the drawing of these very desirable composites that previously could not be drawn to near final size. Research results showed that the proposed Phase 1 mechanical wire guides were sufficiently effective and successful in eliminating breakage when used along with other advanced <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> technology to justify the development of an integrated compact production type Advanced <b>Wire</b> <b>Drawing</b> Station. New insights into the formation and growth of a shear type defect that causes breakage lead to improved drawing technology and it will be the basis for further study and improvements included in a Phase 2 proposal. Potential application of the research: This new capability now justifies the development of an integrated compact production type Advanced <b>Wire</b> <b>Drawing</b> Station to replace the bulky, slower and research oriented equipment that currently uses four independent operations for each wire diameter reduction. In a Phase 2 proposal, the designs for each operation were to be optimized for their performance and so they could be used to integrate these individual operations into an Advanced <b>Wire</b> <b>Drawing</b> Station. This station will perform all the mechanical conditioning, cleaning, lubrication, guidance and drawing operations simultaneously and it will be tested to verify <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> performance targets.
