25|$|<b>Waterpump</b> {{gained a}} new {{responsibility}} in March 1968. A forward air control operation named Raven FACs {{was formed in}} Laos; incoming volunteers were briefed at <b>Waterpump</b> before entering Laos. Still another task was laid upon them on 17 July 1968. Ambassador William H. Sullivan decided to expand the Air Commando Air Operation Centers from four specialists to about 14. The expanded AOC would have an instructor pilot in command, additional Raven FACs as needed, a senior enlisted flight line chief, a medic, a radio operator, an aircraft ordnance specialist, an avionics specialist, a ground support equipment specialist, and two engine mechanics. The latter were assigned to six month TDYs from <b>Waterpump.</b> The AOC expansion was codified as Palace Dog; many experienced <b>Waterpump</b> veterans would return for repeat tours under this program.|$|E
25|$|<b>Waterpump</b> grew {{beyond its}} {{original}} training mission. From 19–29 July 1964, some Air Commandos were smuggled into Laos as an improvised Tactical Air Control Party for Operation Triangle. The {{success of the}} endeavor led to a forward air control system being {{set up for the}} war's duration. Some <b>Waterpump</b> personnel were later infiltrated into Laos to help staff regional Air Operation Centers. With <b>Waterpump</b> help, by war's end the RLAF had grown from 20 to 75 T-28 strike aircraft; it also operated ten AC-47 gunships and 71 support aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Project <b>Waterpump</b> (alternately, Operation <b>Waterpump,</b> {{or simply}} <b>Waterpump)</b> was a secretive support {{operation}} by the U.S. Air Force {{to train and}} nurture into existence the Royal Lao Air Force (RLAF). The United States had decided to covertly support the Kingdom of Laos in the Laotian Civil War as the Lao fended off a North Vietnamese invasion. The nascent RLAF {{was seen as a}} force multiplier but needed pilots and technicians. The 40-man Detachment 6, 1st Air Commando Wing, code named <b>Waterpump,</b> was forwarded to Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base for this training duty in March 1964. They would remain on duty through the truce of 21 February 1973. Their first hasty assignment was transition training to the T-28 Trojan for American civilian pilots; the resulting A Team would exist through 1967. The Air Commandos also conducted final training for Royal Thai Air Force (RTAF) mercenary pilots; the resultant B Team would serve until 1970. Besides putting a polish on graduate pilots, the <b>Waterpump</b> detachment trained Lao pilots from scratch. The RLAF's high pilot casualty rate made bringing the RLAF rosters up to strength a long grind.|$|E

5000|$|As mayor, Beard {{appointed}} the Republican activist Harriet Belchic to the Shreveport Women's Commission and the Riverfront Redevelopment Advisory Committee. The panel completed Riverfront Park {{although it was}} poorly designed and unable to withstand seasonal overflows of the nearby Red River. Rising waters would flood the fountains {{in the park and}} interfere with the operation of the <b>waterpumps.</b>|$|R
25|$|On 18 March 1969, <b>Waterpump</b> began a {{new mission}} supervising a Mobile Training Team instructing air crew members for AC-47 gunships. In June 1969, a second class of Hmong pilots {{finished}} training and joined Vang Pao {{and the single}} surviving pilot from the first class. On 11 July 1969 that pilot, Lee Lue, was killed in action. Nor was his death in action unusual; after five years, <b>Waterpump</b> was barely able to replace RLAF pilots as they were killed.|$|E
25|$|On 21 February 1973, the ceasefire {{mandated}} by the Vientiane Treaty came into effect. U.S. bombing halted on the 22nd. By this time, <b>Waterpump</b> had grown to a strength of 316 assigned personnel. All the disparate U.S. covert organizations in Laos faced downsizing as they were incorporated into a Defense Attaché's office. In Waterpump's case, Americans were withdrawn from the AOCs in the Military Regions {{as part of the}} downsizing. T-28 missions almost ceased, then resumed limpingly. On 5 April 1974, the new Provisional Government of National Union (PGNU) took charge of Laos. By that time, <b>Waterpump</b> had been subsumed by the Defense Attaché.|$|E
25|$|<b>Waterpump</b> also {{succeeded in}} its civic action program. Beginning with {{informal}} medical missions to villages near the Udorn air base, the civic action program would spread throughout Thailand, {{and result in}} a hospital for RLAF personnel in Savannakhet, Laos.|$|E
50|$|The {{programs}} {{are influenced by}} the Gandhian philosophy of each village being self-reliant. The policy of the Barefoot College is to take students, primarily women from the poorest of villages and teach them skills such as installing, building and repairing solar lamps and <b>waterpumps</b> without requiring them to read or write. In extreme cases, there are students without verbal fluency in the languages of their teachers.|$|R

He was also a talented artist and etcher, wrote poems and epigrams, and composed a singspiel, Andromeda and Perseus, performed in Vienna.|$|R
50|$|After {{the death}} of her husband, Mary Todd Lincoln was an {{involuntary}} resident of the Batavia Institute on May 20, 1875. Mrs. Lincoln was released four months later on September 11, 1875. In the late 19th century, Batavia was a major manufacturer of the Conestoga wagons used in the country's westward expansion. Into the early 20th century, most of the windmill operated <b>waterpumps</b> in use throughout America's farms were made at one of the three windmill manufacturing companies in Batavia. Many of the original limestone buildings that were part of these factories are still in use today as government and commercial offices and storefronts. The Aurora Elgin and Chicago Railway constructed a power plant in southern Batavia and added a branch to the city in 1902. The Campana Factory was built in 1936 to manufacture cosmetics for The Campana Company, most notably Italian Balm, the nation's best-selling hand lotion at the time.|$|R
25|$|On 1 April, the USAF set up Project <b>Waterpump,</b> {{which was}} a pilot {{training}} program in Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base to supply Lao pilots for the Royal Laotian Air Force. The RLAF also began augmenting its ranks with Thai volunteer pilots in 1964.|$|E
25|$|In 1970, the B Team {{would finally}} depart as the RLAF reached its full strength. The 11th group of Thai pilots {{graduated}} from <b>Waterpump</b> on 17 April, but {{were returned to}} the Royal Thai Air Force, thus leaving the tenth group to end the Firefly program.|$|E
25|$|On 6 December 1963, Commander in Chief Pacific {{recommended}} that counterinsurgency {{experts from the}} Special Air Warfare Center at Eglin Air Force Base be detailed to aid the Royal Lao Air Force. On 5 March 1964, U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara approved deployment of Detachment 6, 1st Air Commando Wing on six month temporary duty to Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base. It was an all-volunteer unit; {{most of the men}} already had similar experience serving in Vietnam with Operation Farmgate. Codenamed variously Project or Operation <b>Waterpump,</b> or simply <b>Waterpump,</b> Detachment 6 was attached to 2nd Air Division in Saigon. It carried out training specified by Deputy Chief, Joint United States Military Advisory Group, Thailand (DEPCHIEFJUSTMAGTHAI). However, because the Ambassador controlled all U.S. military activities in Laos, reality said the Air Commandos answered to him.|$|E
2500|$|Flutter as a {{controlled}} aerodynamic instability phenomenon is used intentionally and positively in windmills for generating electricity {{and in other}} works like making musical tones on ground-mounted devices, {{as well as on}} musical kites. Flutter is not always a destructive force; recent {{progress has been made in}} windmills for underserved communities in developing countries, designed specifically to take advantage of this effect. The oscillating motion allows variable-stroke <b>waterpumping</b> to match the variable power in the wind. Semirotary binary flutter can also have an upper critical airspeed at which it stops, affording automatic high wind protection [...] The resulting Wing'd Pump has been designed to mount on the well it pumps or float on the pond it draws from. At its large scale the flutter is coupled by static gravity imbalance as well as dynamic imbalance. Further a gravity pendulum [...] achieves large amplitude elasticity most practically. The same annual output can be achieved with wing length equal to a multiblade rotary windpump's diameter, in half the windspeed regime. P. Sharp and J. Hare showed a toy linear generator run by two flutter wings.|$|R
40|$|In Romania the {{economically}} efficient irrigated area {{is estimated at}} 3. 5 million hectares. On national scale there is nointegrated approach for monitoring {{the quantity and quality}} of the irrigation water, using adequate equipment at thepumping station. On international scale, in many countries the pumping stations are provided with equipment formonitoring, on real time, the quality or the pumped water and for warning about critical situations (emergencies). This paper describes a technical solution consisting of equipment which monitors the following parameters of <b>waterpumped</b> in irrigation systems: turbidity, pH, CE at 25 o C, Na+, Cl-. The lapse of time for monitoring is of 10 to 60 min. The main components are the following: the sampling pump (submersible) the monitoring board, the repression pipe ofthe analyzed water. Warnings are made about values exceeding the programmed level for each monitored parameter,about the fact that the pump and agitator do not work or about any other source of damage. The technical solution and equipment were tested at a pumping station which uses water from Danube, in most casesmixed with water originating from drainage. Results showed a reduction of the total content of soluble salts from soiland of their negative impact upon the crops, a reduction of the degree of river alluvial deposits within the irrigationsystem and reduction of the energetic consumption required for pumping...|$|R
40|$|All {{over the}} world, {{electricity}} {{has turned out}} to be the most preferred form of energy. Even in rural India, wherever electricity has been provided, its acceptance has been quite good. Supply of electricity in rural areas draws the power generated at centralised plants based on coal, hydro and 13; nuclear which is chanellised through a common network and distributed over a vast region. Although, there are a variety of technical and other problems associated with x 2022;quot;. large power generation, transmission and distribution systems, the benefits from such systems are considerably high meriting further,expansion and growth. There has been however, a recurring problem of monsoon failure in catchment areas of hydroelectric power stations. Almost 40 % of installed generation capacity in the country is based on hydro power and some States such as Kamataka are totally dependent on hydro power. It normally takes a minimum 13; of five years for executing a large thermal power project and even longer for hydro projects. Wind electric generators in power ratings of the order of 100 kW can be deployed much faster once a decision is made to support their development and utilisation. It is the proposal of this paper to suggest some possibilities in this direction. 13; Although, applications like <b>waterpumping,</b> crushing and grinding of agricultural produce are traditional examples of wind energy utilisation, generation of electricity from winds has come to stay of its own more firmly during the present century. Small battery chargers and wind electric generators (WEGs) of a few kilowatt capacity have been in the market of industrialised countries for several decades. Principal users of these devices generally are individuals and organisations located in remote areas. There is some scope for the use of similar devices in India as well, but this mode of wind energy utilisation is not discussed further in this paper...|$|R
25|$|By {{the time}} <b>Waterpump</b> ceased operations, the Air Force it {{supported}} {{had grown to}} 75 T-28s, ten AC-47s, 21 C-47s, 26 H-34 helicopters, and 24 O-1 Bird Dogs. However, the RLAF suffered from its ongoing problems with training technicians, and {{was believed to be}} able to handle only 70% of maintenance on the aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Ambassador Leonard Unger {{approved}} his Programs Evaluation Office {{turning over}} bombs to the RLAF on 17 May. He also requested additional T-28s for the RLAF. Major Cochran forwarded the four <b>Waterpump</b> T-28s to Vientiane on the 18th; Thao Ma and his wingmen flew 12 combat sorties that afternoon. That same day, Unger urged his superiors in Washington, DC to approve use of American pilots in T-28s. Three days later, ten replacement T-28s arrived at <b>Waterpump,</b> forwarded from the Republic of Vietnam Air Force as excess to their needs. Approval also came through from Washington allowing use of American pilots. As some Air America pilots were ex-military fighter pilots, {{they were already}} highly experienced. On 25 May 1964, after a week's familiarization training with the T-28, five Air America pilots flew their first combat mission, but to little effect except bullet holes {{in two of the}} planes. Ambassador Unger witnessed the battle damage and decided use of American pilots had to be restricted to emergency situations.|$|E
25|$|Run by a 41-man {{team from}} Detachment 6 of the 1st Air Commando Wing, this {{facility}} was an end {{run around the}} treaty obligation that forbade training in Laos. Besides training pilots, <b>Waterpump</b> encouraged cooperation between the RLAF and the Royal Thai Air Force. It was also tasked, as a last resort, to augment the RLAF to counter a renewed Communist offensive in Laos.|$|E
40|$|A model based {{estimation}} {{process is}} implemented in simulation of a transmissionline {{for the purpose}} of leak detection. The model has one inlet, one branch and twooutlets. The objective of this thesis is aimed at determining, through simulation results,the effectiveness of the Kalman Filter for leak detection in a pipeline network. Water distribution systems often contain a large amount of unknown losses. Themagnitude of the water loss range from 10 to over 50 percent of the total <b>waterpumped.</b> Water leaks and losses lead to an unnecessary increase in energy usedto pump water to users, which means higher costs for the providers and thus thecustomers. Our increasing population and the necessity and limited availability ofwater will, and are already causing problems, so it is obvious that more controlefforts need to be implemented on these systems. Moreover, leaks that are not consideredto be major faults tend to go unnoticed, which in total add up to a lot ofwater loss. The work done in this thesis may also be relevant for the petroleum industry, astransportation of oil and gas also face many of the same problems as the waterdistribution industry. One should also note that the environmental impact of leaksin oil pipes are bigger than those in water pipes. The leak detection process used in this thesis is model based. A model of a transmissionline with a branch and two outlets is derived from two basic partial differentialequations describing mass and momentum balances for a hydraulic transmission line. Simulations are run, and when the system is in its steady state, a leak is introduced. Flow and pressure at all three extremes are used as inputs to the Kalman Filter. The likelyhood of two leaks occuring simultaneously is low, so only one leak will beexpected at a time. Localization of the leaks are not studied, only the detecton and the magnitude. It is shown that a Kalman Filter {{can be used as a}} detection method in this systemto a certain degree. The changes caused by the pressure change is noticable when aleak occurs in a large scale system, even if the leak is very small. The speed of theKalman Filter proved to be a problem area, as some of the estimated states useda long time to reach its final value. More satisfying results may be found throughmore rigorous testing, improvements in the model itself, and changes to the tuningparameters in the Kalman Filter. </p...|$|R
25|$|The {{following}} month, Cochran, his unit's intelligence officer, {{and several}} other Air Commandos were covertly smuggled into Laos to participate in Operation Triangle. They served as an impromptu Tactical Air Control Party, coordinating complex air operations among Triangle's three columns and serving as forward air controllers. The operation was successful. Despite the distraction of Operation Triangle, <b>Waterpump</b> managed to bring the RLAF T-28 force to 15 fully trained pilots, with five more in process.|$|E
25|$|In November 1971, to {{counteract}} a cutback in Raven FACs in Laos from 25 to eight by November 1972, <b>Waterpump</b> began training Lao forward air controllers. With most candidates having already flown over 3,000 combat missions, flying or combat experience {{was not an}} issue. The first class of Nok Ka Tien FACS graduated in January 1972 and began directing RLAF air strikes. By September 1972, four Lao FACs had progressed to directing air strikes for the USAF.|$|E
25|$|As the <b>Waterpump</b> mission continued, it was {{attached}} to the 606th Air Commando Squadron in 1966. General Vang Pao agitated for his own Hmong pilots to support his Clandestine Army. He pointed out that the other four military regions of Laos had an RLAF squadron; that they did not share their air assets with him, and that he had need of the same. CIA case agent James William Lair began a pilot training program for him in Thailand, using scrounged light aircraft and instructor pilots scrounged from the Thai Police Aerial Reinforcement Unit, Continental Air Services, Inc, and the Royal Thai Air Force. By Summer 1967, the improvised program had graduated dozens of neophyte pilots in its three classes. Two of them were the first of 19 Hmong pilots accepted for <b>Waterpump</b> training. The Hmong were unlikely pilot candidates. They were unfamiliar with modern machinery, possessed little English, and were of small stature. However, wood blocks wired to the rudder pedals brought that control within reach of the short-legged cadets. Seat cushions in the T-28s boosted the Hmong high enough they could see out of the cockpit to fly.|$|E
25|$|By mid-morning 21 March 1970, {{the communists}} {{had been pushed}} back out of Skyline One. RLAF Thai {{mercenary}} pilots also attacked, using the Lima strip at Moung Kassy as an improvised forward base as it was nearest to the Plain except Muang Soui. With cloud cover clearing, RLAF T-28s were flown in to begin operations from 20A. With Vang Pao helping to arm the aircraft, two Hmong pilots began bombing Sam Thong. One of the Hmong pilots flew 31 sorties in a day. Twelve more RLAF T-28 strikes were flown by American pilots from Project <b>Waterpump.</b>|$|E
25|$|Thereafter, {{use of the}} A Team {{was always}} highly {{selective}} {{because of the potential}} international media sensation if an American fell into communist hands. However, {{in the absence of any}} other combat search and rescue capabilities, the A Team covered pilot retrieval efforts in Laos. The Thai B Team offered certain advantages; the Thai and Lao languages being mutually understandable helped considerably. Then too, the Thais being paid directly by Americans made them amenable to command. In the first year of <b>Waterpump,</b> 23 B Team pilots served in the RLAF. Amidst all this, Water Pump also began to train Lao pilots.|$|E
25|$|Some Air Commandos now {{began to}} {{infiltrate}} Laos. In May 1964, two formed a skeletal Air Operations Center at Wattay outside Vientiane. The Air Commandos also pushed the envelope to sneakily fly some combat missions {{from time to}} time. Moreover, when U.S. Navy Lieutenant Charles F. Klusman was shot down on an armed reconnaissance mission on 6 June 1964, B and A Team pilots successively flew cover for the combat search and rescue effort. Also in June, a <b>Waterpump</b> officer and two enlisted specialists were covertly sent to Luang Prabang to support B Team efforts there.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{returning}} to Laos, Lair found that enemy activities were spreading outwards from their supply center at Tchepone. As the communists occupied more ground within Laos, {{they began to}} build the road network that was becoming known as the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Lair countered with Project Hardnose, in which reconnaissance teams were dispatched from Savannakhet and Pakse to spy on the nascent logistics route between North and South Vietnam. Air attacks seemed the only method of cutting the trail. The Royal Lao Air Force received its first T-28 Trojans as light strike aircraft. A pilot training program for Lao pilots dubbed Operation <b>Waterpump</b> was established at Udorn.|$|E
25|$|On 13 June, the RLAF flew 17 sorties against Pathet Lao {{artillery}} and antiaircraft guns on Phou Kout Mountain menacing Neutralist positions near Muang Soui. Due to an inadequate forward air control system, {{some of the}} ordnance struck friendly troops. Although this disclosed a dangerous shortcoming in the Lao military's air management, General Thao Ma, commander of the RLAF, refused to supply Air Liaison Officers to direct the RLAF T-28 Trojans for the planned Lao attack. In fact, Ma transferred nine of his 20 T-28s south to Savannakhet, moving them out of possible range of targets on the Plain of Jars. Arranging air support for the upcoming Operation Triangle was thus left to the air attaché, Colonel Robert Tyrell. Two American pilots from Project <b>Waterpump</b> in Udorn, Thailand were forwarded to the Neutralists to fly O-1 Bird Dogs in their support, but their efforts were foiled by restrictions imposed by American ambassador Leonard Unger. Nevertheless, operational planning continued.|$|E
25|$|Lair had {{reservations}} about {{increased use of}} US air power in Laos, fearing that the Hmong and other Lao forces would become too dependent upon it. However, {{in the wake of}} the Battle of Nam Bac, he could see the need for organized forward air control for close air support. His proposal to place Lao interpreters with US fighter pilots in light aircraft to direct air strikes became the Raven Forward Air Controllers. Moreover, he could see the utility of pilots and infantry sharing a common language. Vang Pao had already requested training slots for Hmong cadets at Project <b>Waterpump</b> at Udorn, and had been refused. Lair quietly scrounged a couple of Piper Cubs and began training Hmong pilots at Nong Khai. A PARU pilot, Somboun Sithoon, served as the first instructor. The instructional staff would come to include two pilots on loan from the Royal Thai Air Force and six more from Continental Air Services, Inc. Three classes of Hmong pilots would graduate by mid-1967, including the pilot who would become the star of the RLAF, Lee Lue.|$|E
25|$|By 9 November 1966, Operation <b>Waterpump</b> had {{graduated}} 42 new Lao T-28 pilots. However, because of defections and casualties, only 24 still {{remained on the}} RLAF rolls. In an attempt to project RLAF needs into the future, Ambassador William H. Sullivan predicted that perhaps seven defecting Lao pilots could be recovered from Thailand, and that six more Lao pilot cadets were about to graduate from training. Sullivan foresaw a need for 55 to 60 Lao pilots to man 44 to 48 T-28s. He noted {{the importance of having}} T-28 pilots with a common language with Lao ground troops, for whom the RLAF flew close air support. Until a sufficient number of Lao pilots had been trained, Thai pilots, whose language was akin to Lao, would fill the close air support role, leaving U. S. Air Force planes free to strike interdiction targets. By the end of 1966, over half of the year's combat sorties had been flown by B Team pilots. The B Team pilots had begun using Muang Soui as an advanced base near the Plaine des Jarres, cutting their sortie time and raising their sortie rate.|$|E
500|$|The {{next stage}} of the {{military}} evolution took place during mid-March 1964, when the U.S. Air Force began Project <b>Waterpump,</b> a program to train Laotian, Thai, Hmong, and Air America aircrews in flight and maintenance of U.S.-supplied AT-28 Trojan ground-attack aircraft. This training was conducted by Detachment 6, 1st Air Commando Wing personnel at Udon Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand. The first mission in support of Vang Pao's forces took place on 25 May. Eventually, the Royal Laotian Air Force would consist of five wings of ten aircraft each. Water Pump could never produce enough pilots, however, since graduation rates barely exceeded the death rate of graduates, who simply flew until they died. The American [...] "civilian pilots" [...] program was phased out in 1966 and Detachment 6 (which continued its training program) was absorbed by the 606th Air Commando Squadron in the same year. The air program did, however, create the world's only guerrilla army with air superiority.|$|E
2500|$|Operation <b>Waterpump</b> {{was set up}} in Thailand {{to train}} more Lao pilots in March 1964. It {{consisted}} of 38 Air Commandos and four T-28D trainers stationed at Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base. Also in March 1964, Ambassador Unger lobbied his State Department for an expanded role for the RLAF. The RLAF flew its first T-28 strike missions directed at communists on the Plaine des Jarres on 17 May 1964. Unger released the embassy's ordnance inventory to the RLAF that same day. Operation <b>Waterpump</b> also forwarded its four T-28s to the RLAF. Two days later, ten surplus T-28s arrived from South Vietnam; four were retained by <b>Waterpump</b> so it could resume training operations while the other six were passed on to the RLAF. To bridge the pilot shortage until <b>Waterpump</b> graduated Lao pilots, the American Programs Evaluation Office covertly recruited five volunteer pilots from Air America, dubbing them the [...] "A Team". They flew their first strike on 25 May 1964; two of the T-28s were damaged by antiaircraft fire while missing their target. Because of the possibility of political fallout if an American pilot should fall into enemy hands, PEO brought in Thai pilots from the RTAF's 223rd Squadron on six-month tours of duty, in a classified operation known as Project Firefly. These recruited mercenaries were known as the [...] "B Team", and began flying strike missions on 1 June 1964. To complete the team designations, Lao pilots were designated as the [...] "C Team". The A and B Teams were under control of Ambassador Unger.|$|E
50|$|<b>Waterpump</b> grew {{beyond its}} {{original}} training mission. From 19-29 July 1964, some Air Commandos were smuggled into Laos as an improvised Tactical Air Control Party for Operation Triangle. The {{success of the}} endeavor led to a forward air control system being {{set up for the}} war's duration. Some <b>Waterpump</b> personnel were later infiltrated into Laos to help staff regional Air Operation Centers. With <b>Waterpump</b> help, by war's end the RLAF had grown from 20 to 75 T-28 strike aircraft; it also operated ten AC-47 gunships and 71 support aircraft.|$|E
50|$|<b>Waterpump</b> {{gained a}} new {{responsibility}} in March 1968. A forward air control operation named Raven FACs {{was formed in}} Laos; incoming volunteers were briefed at <b>Waterpump</b> before entering Laos. Still another task was laid upon them on 17 July 1968. Ambassador William H. Sullivan decided to expand the Air Commando Air Operation Centers from four specialists to about 14. The expanded AOC would have an instructor pilot in command, additional Raven FACs as needed, a senior enlisted flight line chief, a medic, a radio operator, an aircraft ordnance specialist, an avionics specialist, a ground support equipment specialist, and two engine mechanics. The latter were assigned to six month TDYs from <b>Waterpump.</b> The AOC expansion was codified as Palace Dog; many experienced <b>Waterpump</b> veterans would return for repeat tours under this program.|$|E
