Stevens was considered a fresh-faced teen star, placing several single releases in the British pop music charts.

25|$|Magnolia Park, {{established}} on Burbank's western {{edge in the}} early 1920s, had 3,500 houses within six years after its creation. When the city refused {{to pay for a}} street connecting the subdivision with the Cahuenga Pass, real estate developer and daily farmer Earl L. White did it himself and called it Hollywood Way. White was owner of KELW, the San Fernando Valley's first commercial radio station, which <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> February 13, 1927. The 1,000-watt radio station was sold in 1935 to the Hearst newspaper company.|$|E
5000|$|Larry [...] "Skip" [...] Morrow owned an FM {{radio station}} but was {{interested}} in also owning an AM station. When he purchased {{what was to become}} KBRD, there wasn't enough radio equipment to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> He was also interested in the KBRD call letters; when the station was ready to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> they belonged to someone else, so <b>the</b> station signed <b>on</b> under his ownership as KLDY. When KBRD became available, Morrow transferred the KLDY callsign to his classical AM station at 1280, making 680 KBRD.|$|R

25|$|In the mid-1940s, {{during a}} {{depressing}} lull {{in his career}} (his radio show Blue Ribbon Town had failed, he failed to sell his proposed sitcom The Flotsam Family only to see it become a huge hit as The Life of Riley with William Bendix in the title role, and the Marx Brothers as film performers were well past their prime), Groucho was scheduled to appear on a radio show with Bob Hope.

25|$|WSMW-TV (Channel 27) in Worcester first {{aired in}} 1970. This {{was one of}} WSMW's inaugural shows when the station first <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> The format was similar to Channel 5's Candlepin Bowling. This show was notable for its use of the 1972 pop hit Roundabout by the British band Yes, {{as well as the}} 1975–1981 {{animated}} opening theme to the tune of The Spinners' Rubberband Man. This show, and all of WSMW's other programming, got cancelled in late 1982 when the station's pay-TV movie block expanded to a 24/7 schedule. Taped at Thunderbird Bowl in Auburn.|$|E
25|$|Gleason (who {{had signed}} a deal in the 1950s that {{included}} a guaranteed $100,000 annual payment for 20 years, even if he never <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air)</b> wanted The Honeymooners {{to be just a}} portion of his format, but CBS wanted another season of only The Honeymooners. The network had cancelled a mainstay variety show hosted by Red Skelton and would cancel The Ed Sullivan Show in 1971 because they had become too expensive to produce and attracted, in the executives' opinion, too old an audience. Gleason simply stopped doing the show in 1970 and left CBS when his contract expired.|$|E

25|$|And, in {{the early}} days of television, Leavitt hosted one of the first outdoor shows on {{national}} television. In 1953 Maine's first TV station <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> and asked sportswriter Leavitt if he would anchor a show on the themes he wrote about in his column. The Bud Leavitt Show debuted that year as one of the first local programs on the air in Maine. For the next 20 years Leavitt appeared every Saturday night to talk about the pressing issues of a Maine outdoorsman: how to remove a fishhook; the death of a favorite dog; snoeshowing and moose hunting and salmon fishing.|$|E
25|$|Because only {{a limited}} number of holes could be made in the disks, and disks beyond a certain {{diameter}} became impractical, image resolution in mechanical television broadcasts was relatively low, ranging from about 30 lines up to about 120. Nevertheless, the image quality of 30-line transmissions steadily improved with technical advances, and by 1933 the UK broadcasts using the Baird system were remarkably clear. A few systems ranging into the 200-line region also <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> Two of these were the 180-line system that Compagnie des Compteurs (CDC) installed in Paris in 1935, and the 180-line system that Peck Television Corp. started in 1935 at station VE9AK in Montreal.|$|E
