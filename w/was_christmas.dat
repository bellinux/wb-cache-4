5|$|Several {{times between}} 1978–89, the two wild-card games {{had to be}} played on {{different}} days. Normally they both would be held on Sunday. In 1983 and 1988, the games were split between Saturday and Monday because Sunday <b>was</b> <b>Christmas,</b> and the NFL had avoided playing on that day at the time. In 1984, both games were played in the Pacific Time Zone, {{so they had to}} be played on Saturday and Sunday to accommodate for time differences. In 1985, both the New York Giants and Jets hosted wild-card games. As they have shared a home stadium since 1984, the games had to be played on different days.|$|E

The episode was also the first time Mr. Garrison was portrayed as an anti-semite and racist, particularly when he asks Mayor McDaniels if she can get rid of all the Mexicans in South Park. Parker said this decision was made because, [...] "Garrison at that point had already shown himself to be the most messed up person in the entire town, and there's obviously so much wrong with him mentally. A person that disturbed being a racist is funny to us." ...|$|E

500|$|As writer Tim Burton's {{upbringing}} in Burbank, California {{was associated}} with the feeling of solitude, the filmmaker was largely fascinated by holidays during his childhood. [...] "Anytime there <b>was</b> <b>Christmas</b> or Halloween, [...] it was great. It gave you some sort of texture all of a sudden that wasn't there before", Burton would later recall. After completing his short film Vincent in 1982, Burton, who was then-employed at Walt Disney Feature Animation, wrote a three-page poem titled The Nightmare Before Christmas, drawing inspiration from television specials of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, How the Grinch Stole Christmas! and the poem A Visit from St. Nicholas. Burton intended to adapt the poem into a television special with the narration spoken by his favorite actor, Vincent Price, but also considered other options such as a children's book. [...] He created concept art and storyboards for the project in collaboration with Rick Heinrichs, who also sculpted character models; Burton later showed his and Heinrichs' works-in-progress to Henry Selick, also a Disney animator at the time. After the success of Vincent in 1982, Disney started to consider developing The Nightmare Before Christmas as either a short film or 30-minute holiday television special. However, the project's development eventually stalled, as its tone seemed [...] "too weird" [...] to the company. As Disney was unable to [...] "offer his nocturnal loners enough scope", Burton was fired from the studio in 1984, and went on to direct the commercially successful films Beetlejuice and Batman.|$|E
