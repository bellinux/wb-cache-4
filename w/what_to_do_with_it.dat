5|$|The Treaty of Paris was {{frequently}} amended as the EC and EU evolved and expanded. With the treaty due to expire in 2002, debate {{began at the}} beginning of the 1990s on <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> It was eventually decided that it should be left to expire. The areas covered by the ECSC's treaty were transferred to the Treaty of Rome and the financial loose ends and the ECSC research fund were dealt with via a protocol of the Treaty of Nice. The treaty finally expired on 23 July 2002. That day, the ECSC flag was lowered for the final time outside the European Commission in Brussels and replaced with the EU flag.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} located on Roosevelt Island, which was once home to a penitentiary and some asylums. Then known as Welfare Island, the island became neglected. During the 1960s, some groups started proposing uses for the island. More {{suggestions}} for <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> were made once the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) {{announced that it would}} build a subway station on the island. The station was intended as a way to encourage transit-oriented development on the island. When construction of the line was delayed, the Roosevelt Island Tram was built in 1973. The Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation was formed in 1984 to develop the island, but was not successful until October 1989 when the subway station opened {{along with the rest of}} the 63rd Street Line. The opening encouraged the development of the island, which has made the station busier.|$|E

When the ship made its final voyage, it was under-crewed by a third. The ship was decommissioned 18 April 1946. As of 2015, the final fate of the ship has not been determined. There was a huge push to convert the U.S. economy from a war basis to a peace time basis. People were flush with money but could not buy anything and people wanted houses and cars. Many patrol craft were immediately scrapped and the steel entered the peace time economy.|$|E

25|$|The {{project was}} largely {{reported}} by the press {{to have been a}} flop: badly thought-out, badly executed, and leaving the government with the embarrassing question of <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> afterwards. During 2000 the organisers repeatedly asked for, and received, more cash from the Millennium Commission, the Lottery body which supported it. Numerous changes at management and Board level, before and during the exhibition, had only limited, if any, results. Jennifer Page was sacked as chief executive of the New Millennium Experience Company just one month after the dome's opening. Press reports suggested that the then Prime Minister Tony Blair personally placed a high priority on making the Dome a success. But part of the problem was that the financial predictions were based on an unrealistically high forecast of visitor numbers at 12 million. During the 12 months it was open there were approximately 6.5 million visitors – significantly fewer than the approximately 10 million paying visitors that attended the Festival of Britain, which only ran from May to September. Empire Exhibition, Scotland 1938 held in Glasgow attracted more than 12 million visitors being open May to October. Unlike the press, visitor feedback was extremely positive. It was the most popular tourist attraction in 2000, second was the London Eye; third was Alton Towers, which had been first in 1999.|$|E
25|$|After the {{surrender}} of the city, the Church of the Holy Sephulcre was ordered to be closed for three days by Saladin while he considered <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> Some of his advisers told him to destroy the Church in order to end all Christian interest in Jerusalem. Most of his advisers however told him to let the Church remain there saying that Christian pilgrimages would continue anyway because of {{the sanctity of the}} place and also reminded him of the Caliph Umar who allowed the Church to remain in Christian hands after conquering the city. Saladin rejected the destruction of the church saying that he had no intention to discourage the Christian pilgrimages to the site and it was reopened after three days on his orders. The Frankish pilgrims were allowed to enter the church upon paying a fee. To solidify Muslim claims to Jerusalem, many holy sites, including the shrine later known as Al-Aqsa Mosque, were ritually purified with rose water. Christian furnishings were removed from the mosque and it was fitted with oriental carpets. Its walls were illuminated with candelabras and text from the Quran. The Orthodox Christians and Jacobites were allowed to remain and to worship as they chose. The Copts who were barred from entering Jerusalem by the Crusader kingdom of Jerusalem as they were considered heretics and atheists, were allowed to enter the city without paying any fees by Saladin as he considered them his subjects. The Coptic places of worship that were earlier taken over by the Crusaders were returned to the Coptic priests. The Copts were also allowed to visit The Church of the Holy Sephulcre and other Christian sites. The Abyssinian Christians were allowed to visit the holy places of Jerusalem without paying any fees.|$|E

Kouandété seized the presidency, though he was unsure <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> Members of his faction urged the new president to remain at his post, though the general public's opinion was against him. Meanwhile, France refused to aid Dahomey and would not recognise Kouandété.

500|$|Creutz {{encountered}} {{several members}} of the faculty at the University of Wisconsin, including Julian Mack, Ragnar Rollefson, Raymond Herb, Eugene Wigner and Gregory Breit. Mack gave Creutz a research project to do in his junior year. Creutz remained at Wisconsin as a graduate student after receiving his Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree in 1936, working for Herb upgrading the departmental Van de Graaff generator from 300 to 600 keV. With this done, the question became <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> and Breit suggested that it had previously been observed that high-energy gamma rays were produced when lithium was bombarded with protons at 440 keV. Creutz therefore wrote his 1939 Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) [...] thesis on Resonance Scattering of Protons by Lithium, under Breit's supervision. Creutz married Lela Rollefson, a mathematics student at Wisconsin, and the sister of Ragnar Rollefson, on September 13, 1937. The couple had three children, two sons, Michael and Carl, and a daughter, Ann Jo.|$|E
500|$|As the Varner–Hogg {{restoration}} {{wound to}} a halt, Hogg refocused her attention on her Houston home, Bayou Bend, which housed {{some of her}} personal collection of antiques and artwork. The New York Times described her [...] "superb Early American furniture" [...] collection in 1953, {{and she had a}} large collection of Americana and colonial Mexican decorative arts, some of which are still in the house. In the late 1950s she said: [...] "I had been collecting American furniture. I collected, and collected, and collected, until I had so much of it I didn't know <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> I decided to give it to a museum." [...] She collaborated with the original architect John Staub on structural changes that would prepare the home to be a museum. She denuded the home of personal items and items that did not meet her concept; the only piece of non-American furniture in the home was her English dining table, which had too many memories for her to remove it.|$|E

500|$|... "Equus October" [...] {{was born}} out of a song that the band were {{considering}} discarding because they were never able to finish it until they entered the studio and changed their minds, wanting more material on the album. They decided to use a riff from it only as an interlude that ran 30 seconds long, but they came up with more ideas about <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> during the mixing process, eventually increasing the length of the song. Rubalcaba explained that the bass guitar line remained a constant fixture on jam sessions between himself and Eginton, and they decided to give it a chance by recording it at the album's sessions. Once Mitchell also began adding material to the song, Rubalcaba felt it started taking on a [...] "strong & majestic yet mournful" [...] sensation, almost as if it were about a ritualistic sacrifice. He later discovered the ritual of the October Horse and based the song's title on that of the ritual. [...] "It took on the feeling I had about the jam & how it just completely comes crashing down so abruptly at the end," [...] he explained. Expanding the song in the studio led the group to want to use it as an interlude that leads into the album's title track.|$|E
