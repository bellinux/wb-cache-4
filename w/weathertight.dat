Polythene sheets were spread on the dust floor of the mill to prevent further water penetration of the structure. The mill was surveyed and recorded. In spring 1980, the dust floor partially collapsed and was removed as a safety measure. Scaffolding was erected to allow the fanstage to be dismantled, and the cap centering wheels were removed in preparation for the removal of the cap frame.|$|E

60|$|I {{will now}} {{go back to}} the year 1867, in which I was still living at Waltham Cross. I had some time since bought the house there which I had at first hired, and added rooms to it, and made it for our {{purposes}} very comfortable. It was, however, a rickety old place, requiring much repair, and occasionally not as <b>weathertight</b> as it should be. We had a domain there sufficient for the cows, and for the making of our butter and hay. For strawberries, asparagus, green peas, out-of-door peaches, for roses especially, and such everyday luxuries, no place was ever more excellent. It was only twelve miles from London, and admitted therefore of frequent intercourse with the metropolis. It was also near enough to the Roothing country for hunting purposes. No doubt the Shoreditch Station, by which it had to be reached, had its drawbacks. My average distance also to the Essex meets was twenty miles. But the place combined as much or more than I had a right to expect. It was within my own postal district, and had, upon the whole, been well chosen.|$|E

50|$|In 1993 with a {{grant from}} the National Heritage Memorial Fund the High Peak Borough Council {{purchased}} the Crescent to act as a temporary caretaker of the building until a suitable buyer could be found. A further £1.5 million from English Heritage was used to make the building <b>weathertight.</b>|$|E
50|$|Prior to 1993 in B.C., {{architects and}} {{engineers}} {{were not required}} to certify that the design met the requirements of the building codes, review the quality of construction, or certify that the construction had been performed in accordance with the codes, permitted drawings, and specifications, including those relating to providing a <b>weathertight</b> building envelope.|$|E
50|$|Lack of {{detailed}} drawings for buildings {{was also a}} contributing factor. Some builders were unable to make a <b>weathertight</b> structure without proper guidance. This has partially been blamed on {{the breakdown of the}} apprenticeship system and unqualified builders in the marketplace. Council staff carrying out building inspections had neither the required construction expertise to ensure weathertightness nor the intuition to look for it.|$|E

50|$|Loading of {{vehicles}} onto G deck was through watertight {{doors at the}} bow and stern. The wheel house was positioned towards the stern, {{making it difficult to}} see the bow doors. Loading {{of vehicles}} onto E deck and F deck was through a <b>weathertight</b> door at the bow and an open portal at the stern. Vehicles could be loaded and unloaded onto E and G deck simultaneously using double-deck linkspans in use at Dover and Calais.|$|E
50|$|Slate {{roof tiles}} are usually fixed (fastened) either with nails, or with hooks as is common with Spanish slate. In the UK, fixing is {{typically}} with double nails onto timber battens (England and Wales) or nailed directly onto timber sarking boards (Scotland and Northern Ireland). Nails were traditionally of copper, {{although there are}} modern alloy and stainless steel alternatives. Both these methods, if used properly, provide a long-lasting <b>weathertight</b> roof with a lifespan of around 80-100 years. Slate roofs are still used today.|$|E
50|$|Compared {{to other}} drive mechanisms, the linear motor is {{typically}} maintenance-free. The pole faces {{on the track}} and moving plate attached to the car {{do not need to}} touch, and the gap between them can be quite wide to accommodate any side-to-side car motion, so there is no friction or wear between them. Further, the magnetic coil assembly on the driving pole plates are either potted or sealed in a <b>weathertight</b> enclosure, so that rain, vibration, and dust do not affect motor performance or cause drive motor slippage.|$|E
50|$|The Legal Services Act 1991 Act {{repealed}} previous {{legislation and}} ensured that legal aid {{was available for}} both civil and criminal cases. At the same time, it widened the proceedings for which legal aid may be awarded and, for the first time, made legal aid available for Waitangi Tribunal claims. The Legal Services Act 2000 further extended the availability of legal aid to cover proceedings in the Environment Court, actions relating to leaky buildings brought under the <b>Weathertight</b> Homes Resolution Services Act 2006, and New Zealand Parole Board hearings.|$|E
5000|$|From 1938 the car {{could also}} be had with a more luxurious Tickford {{drophead}} coupé body by Salmons of Newport Pagnell and 252 were made. The soft top {{could be used in}} three positions, fully open, closed or open just over the seats. Wind-up windows were fitted to the higher topped doors making the car more <b>weathertight</b> and individual bucket seats used in the fully carpeted interior. Complete chassis were fitted with a very basic body at the Abingdon factory and driven to Newport Pagnell to have their coachwork fitted.|$|E

50|$|The primary {{function}} of the cladding system {{is to provide a}} <b>weathertight</b> building envelope, suitable for the intended use of the building.Trapezoidal metal roof sheets with through fix fasteners are generally suitable for slopes of 4% or steeper. This limit is critical to the performance of the cladding. For shallower pitches, down to 1.5%, a fix system with no exposed through fasteners, special side laps and preferably no end laps should be used. For low pitch roof, ponding is a potential problem that must be considered at the design stage {{in order to avoid the}} deleterious effects of prolonged soaking and the increased loading, due to the weight of the water.|$|E
50|$|Although LEDs are {{long-life}} devices, older or lower-quality {{strands of}} LED-based holiday lights can suffer from early failure. This is particularly so with blue ones, {{which are the}} newest and most expensive, and therefore prone to cost-cutting. Most LED-based holiday lights use copper wire which connects to the plated, copper-alloy leads of the LEDs. Having dissimilar metals in contact can result in galvanic corrosion inside of the lamps' sockets, causing them to stop working. Some older sets of LED holiday lights have each LED permanently mounted in a non-removable <b>weathertight</b> base to keep out rain and other moisture, helping to prevent such corrosion; however, this prevents the user from replacing defective lamps.|$|E
50|$|After {{years of}} abandonment, the convent was finally {{converted}} into residential units and the nuns chapel broken up into flats. The adjoining chapel was acquired in a derelict state by the Historic Chapels Trust who have negotiated grant of £143,000 from English Heritage and raised additional donations {{for the first}} phase of repairs, completed in 2011. These have rendered the chapel secure and <b>weathertight.</b> The chapel is available for hire for concerts, meetings and small scale events during the warmer months and occasional services are held. Donations and grants are being sought for the £250,000 needed to complete the restoration. A local committee has been created to help manage the chapel day to day and to explore new uses for the space.|$|E
40|$|An {{electronic}} unit denoted the Miniature Intelligent Sensor Module performs sensor-signal-conditioning functions and local processing of sensor data. The unit includes four channels of analog input/output circuitry, a processor, volatile and nonvolatile memory, and two Ethernet communication ports, all {{housed in a}} <b>weathertight</b> enclosure. The unit accepts AC or DC power. The analog inputs provide programmable gain, offset, and filtering as well as shunt calibration and auto-zeroing. Analog outputs include sine, square, and triangular waves having programmable frequencies and amplitudes, as well as programmable amplitude DC. One innovative aspect of the design of this unit is the integration of a relatively powerful processor and large amount of memory along with the sensor-signalconditioning circuitry so that sophisticated computer programs {{can be used to}} acquire and analyze sensor data and estimate and track the health of the overall sensor-data-acquisition system of which the unit is a part. The unit includes calibration, zeroing, and signalfeedback circuitry to facilitate health monitoring. The processor is also integrated with programmable logic circuitry in such a manner as to simplify and enhance acquisition of data and generation of analog outputs. A notable unique feature of the unit is a cold-junction compensation circuit in the back shell of a sensor connector. This circuit makes it possible to use Ktype thermocouples without compromising a housing seal. Replicas of this unit may prove useful in industrial and manufacturing settings - especially in such large outdoor facilities as refineries. Two features can be expected to simplify installation: the <b>weathertight</b> housings should make it possible to mount the units near sensors, and the Ethernet communication capability of the units should facilitate establishment of communication connections for the units...|$|E
40|$|This thesis chronicles my {{experiences}} with developing a panelized wall system {{for use by}} Habitat for Humanity and with testing that system {{in the design and}} construction of a house. Presented as a series of narratives, it follows the progress of the project from August 2003 to December 2005. Described is my motivation to test my theories through design and construction, the applicability of prefabrication to Habitat for Humanity’s use of unskilled volunteer labour, the incorporation of panelization into the design of a house for the Waterloo Region affiliate of Habitat for Humanity, the prefabrication of preclad wood framed wall panels for this house by students at the University of Waterloo School of Architecture, the erection of these wall panels on-site, and the completion of the house to a <b>weathertight</b> state. The thesis concludes with discussions of the understanding I gained through {{my experiences}}, the necessity for further development and testing of the panelized wall system, and the future use of prefabrication by Habitat for Humanity...|$|E
40|$|When using wood-based {{materials}} as exterior layer {{it is necessary}} to coat this material with a <b>weathertight</b> coating. Examinations of test-methods, criteria and requirements have been carried out to identify the weathertightness of liquid or paste-like done coating system. To this end, test-methods for lacquers, particle boards and other building materials have been examined and, where necessary, modified. Four coating systems weathered on building material in natural climate and on pieces of particle boards in conditioned chambers have been tested. The examinations concerned e. g. the moisture behaviour of wood-based materials in building materials, of the particle boards in conditioned chambers and of the coating systems themselves; further on the water vapour permeability, impact resistance, flexibility and adhesive strength of the coating systems as well as the absorption of wood-based materials by the capillary water flow through the water-repellent layers of the coating system. The results of the examination served to derivate a proposal for the testing of the coatings with at least one water-repellent layer on polyurethane (PUR) base. This proposal contains requirements and criteria for the coatings, general statements as to the testing and pretreatment of samples from house facades, the climates which should be applied, the different test-methods and the practical use of these test-methods.

40|$|In July 2011 the NZ Government {{passed into}} law a {{financial}} compensation package {{in the form}} of the <b>Weathertight</b> Homes Resolution Service (Financial Assistance Package) Amendment Bill to assist homeowners in repairing homes damaged by water entering their buildings. The Financial Assistance Package (FAP) scheme for homeowners was a no-faults scheme that offered a remedy for cash strapped owners where none had existed previously. Why then, some three years after its introduction, has there been limited uptake by homeowners, with some labelling the scheme a failure? This paper explores the reasons leading up to its introduction of this financial package legislation, particularly the thrust of the submissions made to the New Zealand Parliament Local Government and Environment Select committee in the submission period prior to the reporting back to Parliament. It will also examined the construction issues that have plagued the NZ building industry since the 1990 s, and which have led to the passing of this legislation. The paper will outline the main characteristics that set this FAP apart from normal lending systems and explore the implications of the package for the homeowner and the building industry here in New Zealand. The reasons for the low uptake of the scheme three years on from its introduction in July 2011 are examined and analysed...|$|E
40|$|Curtain {{walls are}} lightweight, <b>weathertight,</b> {{exterior}} facades. They {{are capable of}} resisting wind loads, but provide no support for the building it {{to which they are}} attached. Although they are used to enclose many different types of modern building, and although they may be designed to carry any of the outward-facing materials an architect might wish to specify, the stereotypical curtain wall is a skyscraper's fully-glazed outer skin. The materials used in these wall systems, particularly their structural aluminium frames, are produced by energy intensive methods. Even though there is an environmental motive to reduce the embodied energy by minimizing aluminium content, and despite the obvious commercial incentive, it is a difficult mathematical challenge to find optimal extrusion shapes. The authors believe that because of the inherent complexity of the optimization task, in the curtain walls of real buildings, metal is used inefficiently. This paper describes the way in which near-optimal shapes for any particular building's curtain wall extrusions may be found using a parametrically-controlled geometric model in conjunction with a numerical search routine – in this case, a genetic algorithm. When the curtain walls designed for large and recently-constructed buildings by experienced facade engineers are compared with designs developed using the algorithmic techniques described herein, it is consistently the numerically-optimized solutions which are more efficient. The magnitude of the metal savings achieved by applying computational methods will vary from building to building, but this study suggests that in many cases aluminium mass may be reduced by 20 % or more...|$|E
