The report also claimed that references to homosexuality increased the most during that decade - by 24-fold. In 2002, the PTC released a report claiming {{that there was}} an increase in profanity on network programming shown during the first hour of prime time. In a 2006 report titled Wolves in Sheep's Clothing, analyst Kristen Fyfe perceived an increase in violent, profane, and sexual content in children's programming. Among its results, based on research during summer 2005, the PTC stated that Teen Titans was the most violent program, and claimed Cartoon Network had the most violent incidents. Richard Huff of the New York Daily News criticized the report for misinterpreting an episode of SpongeBob SquarePants, [...] "Sailor Mouth", over its intent to satirize profanity implicitly.|$|E

40|$|Thucydides' {{classic work}} {{on the history of}} the Peloponnesian War is the root of Western conceptions of history—including the idea that Western history is the {{foundation}} of everyone else's. Here, Marshall Sahlins takes on Thucydides and the conceptions of history he wrought with a groundbreaking new book that shows <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>an</b> anthropological concept of culture can make to the writing of history. Sahlins begins by confronting Thucydides' account of the Peloponnesian War with an analogous "Polynesian War," the fight for the domination of the Fiji Islands (1843 - 55) between a great sea power (like Athens) and a great land power (like Sparta). Sahlins draws parallels between the conflicts with an eye to their respective systems of power and sovereignty as well as to Thucydides' alternation between individual (Pericles, Themistocles) and collective (the Athenians, the Spartans) actors in the making of history. Characteristic of most histories ever written, this alternation between the agency of "Great Men" and collective entities leads Sahlins to a series of incisive analyses ranging in subject matter from Bobby Thomson's "shot heard round the world" for the 1951 Giants to the history-making of Napoleon and certain divine kings to the brouhaha over Elián Gonzalez. Finally, again departing from Thucydides, Sahlins considers the relationship between cultural order and historical contingency through the recounting of a certain royal assassination that changed the course of Fijian history, a story of fratricide and war worthy of Shakespeare. In this most convincing presentation yet of his influential theory of culture, Sahlins experiments with techniques for mixing rich narrative with cultural explication in the hope of doing justice at once to the actions of persons and the customs of people. And he demonstrates the necessity of taking culture into account in the creation of history—with apologies to Thucydides, who too often did not...|$|R
6000|$|She {{signified}} her assent, {{and leaned}} wearily {{back in her}} chair. The agent began to read. His mistress watched him through half closed eyes. His voice, notwithstanding its strong country dialect, {{had a sort of}} sing-song intonation. He read earnestly and without removing his eyes from the document. His listener made no attempt to arrive at the sense of the string of words which flowed so monotonously from his lips. She was occupied in making a study of the man. Sturdy and weather-beaten, neatly dressed in country clothes, with a somewhat old-fashioned stock, with trim grey side-whiskers, and a mouth which reminded her somehow of a well-bred foxhound's, he represented to her, in his clearly cut personality, the changeless side of life, the side of life which she associated with the mighty oaks in her park, and the prehistoric rocks which had become engrafted with the soil of the hills beyond. As she saw him now, so had he seemed to her fifteen years ago. Only <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference!</b> <b>A</b> volume to her--a paragraph to him! She had gone out into the world--rich, intellectually inquisitive, possessing most of the subtler gifts with which her sex is endowed; and wherever the passionate current of life had flown the swiftest, she had been there, a leader always, seeking ever to satisfy the unquenchable thirst for new experiences and new joys. She had passed from girlhood to womanhood with every nerve of her body strained to catch the emotion of the moment. Always her fingers had been tearing at the cells of life--and one by one they had fallen away. This morning, in the bright sunshine which flooded the great room, she felt somehow tired--tired and withered. Her maid was a fool! The two hours spent at her toilette had been wasted! She felt that her eyes were hollow, her cheeks pale! Fifteen years, and the man had not changed a jot. She doubted whether he had ever passed the confines of her estate. She doubted whether he had even had the desire. Wind and sun had tanned his cheeks, his eyes were clear, his slight stoop was the stoop of the horseman rather than of age. He had the air of a man satisfied with life and his place in it--an attitude which puzzled her. No one of her world was like that! Was it some inborn gift, she wondered, which he possessed, some antidote to the world's restlessness which he carried with him, or was it merely lack of intelligence? ...|$|E
6000|$|Fanny {{was right}} enough in not expecting {{to hear from}} Miss Crawford now at the rapid rate in which their {{correspondence}} had begun; Mary's next letter was after a decidedly longer interval than the last, {{but she was not}} right in supposing that such an interval would be felt a great relief to herself. Here was another strange revolution of mind! She was really glad to receive the letter when it did come. In her present exile from good society, and distance from everything that had been wont to interest her, a letter from one belonging to the set where her heart lived, written with affection, and some degree of elegance, was thoroughly acceptable. The usual plea of increasing engagements was made in excuse for not having written to her earlier; [...] "And now that I have begun," [...] she continued, [...] "my letter will not be worth your reading, for there will be no little offering of love at the end, no three or four lines passionnees from the most devoted H. C. in the world, for Henry is in Norfolk; business called him to Everingham ten days ago, or perhaps he only pretended to call, for the sake of being travelling {{at the same time that}} you were. But there he is, and, by the bye, his absence may sufficiently account for any remissness of his sister's in writing, for there has been no 'Well, Mary, when do you write to Fanny? Is not it time for you to write to Fanny?' to spur me on. At last, after various attempts at meeting, I have seen your cousins, 'dear Julia and dearest Mrs. Rushworth'; they found me at home yesterday, and we were glad to see each other again. We seemed very glad to see each other, and I do really think we were a little. We had a vast deal to say. Shall I tell you how Mrs. Rushworth looked when your name was mentioned? I did not use to think her wanting in self-possession, but she had not quite enough for the demands of yesterday. Upon the whole, Julia was in the best looks of the two, at least after you were spoken of. There was no recovering the complexion from the moment that I spoke of 'Fanny,' and spoke of her as a sister should. But Mrs. Rushworth's day of good looks will come; we have cards for her first party on the 28th. Then she will be in beauty, for she will open one of the best houses in Wimpole Street. I was in it two years ago, when it was Lady Lascelle's, and prefer it to almost any I know in London, and certainly she will then feel, to use a vulgar phrase, that she has got her pennyworth for her penny. Henry could not have afforded her such a house. I hope she will recollect it, and be satisfied, as well as she may, with moving the queen of a palace, though the king may appear best in the background; and as I have no desire to tease her, I shall never force your name upon her again. She will grow sober by degrees. From all that I hear and guess, Baron Wildenheim's attentions to Julia continue, but I do not know that he has any serious encouragement. She ought to do better. A poor honourable is no catch, and I cannot imagine any liking in the case, for take away his rants, and the poor baron has nothing. <b>What</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>a</b> vowel makes! If his rents were but equal to his rants! Your cousin Edmund moves slowly; detained, perchance, by parish duties. There may be some old woman at Thornton Lacey to be converted. I am unwilling to fancy myself neglected for a young one. Adieu! my dear sweet Fanny, this is a long letter from London: write me a pretty one in reply to gladden Henry's eyes, when he comes back, and send me an account of all the dashing young captains whom you disdain for his sake." ...|$|E

40|$|Adherence to {{antiretroviral}} {{combination therapy}} in children. <b>What</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> half <b>a</b> day makes…” has explored {{the opportunities to}} support evidence generation and extrapolation across populations, with special focus on {{the selection of the}} dose, the optimisation of dosing regimens and the impact of patient behaviour towards antiretroviral treatment. A model-based approach for the evaluation of covariate effects and forgiveness of non-adherence, which may allow simplification of current dosing regimens taking into consideration inadequate compliance and its implication for efficacy and drug resistance, has been proposed. In conjunction with clinical trial simulations, this thesis addressed the possibility to evaluate relevant clinical scenarios and predict treatment outcome of simplified dosing regimens, taking into account the differences in the patterns of drug intake and the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynam ic properties of antiretroviral drugs.

40|$|WHAT I {{am going}} to talk about is the {{relation}} of sensing to perceiving. We have all believed that we understood the process of sensation fairly well and that only the process of perception gave us difficulties. But I {{am going to}} suggest on the contrary that a straightforward theory of perception is possible and that it is our understanding of sensation which is confused. First let us make sure that there is really a problem in how to treat sensing and perceiving. Some psychologists now maintain that there is no difference between them in fact. The distinction has broken down; they say it has no validity and we should forget it. I think that what they mean is this. An individual can make discriminations in many ways. We can say either that he is sensitive to many variables of stimulation or that he can experience many kinds of differences between things but what has importance, the argument goes, are only the facts of discrimination, not whether they are called sensory or perceptual. There is something valid in this argument. I would call it the experimentalist's position—stick to the facts and cut the cackle! It is enough to determine just <b>what</b> <b>differences</b> <b>an</b> animal, a child, or a man can respond to and what others he cannot. This limited aim of psychology might be called simple psychophysics (not metric psychophysics) and it is good experimental science. But it provides no explanation of how the individual keeps in touch with the environment around him. The problem of perception, then, the problem of contact with the environment, still remains. The variables of sensory discrimination are radically different from the variables of perceptual discrimination. The former are said to be dimensions like quality, intensity, extensity, and duration, dimensions of hue, brightness, and saturation, of pitch, loudness, and timbre, of pressure...|$|R
