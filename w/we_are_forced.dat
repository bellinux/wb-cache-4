The reality is that the institutional presence of Islam in Tunisia, although strictly circumscribed, is truly a constant reference, implicit or explicit, legitimizing the regime's direction. Certainly, Tunisian public services are accessible to all without distinction of creed and the constitution guarantees religious freedom, so long as it does not threaten public order, but Islam remains the state religion, {{to the extent that it}} is said it is obligatory for the president of the republic to be able to assert it.|$|E
25|$|The {{more closely}} we look into history, the more clearly shall we {{perceive}} {{that the system}} of chivalry is an invention almost entirely poetical. It is impossible to distinguish the countries {{in which it is}} said to have prevailed. It is always represented as distant from us both in time and place, and whilst the contemporary historians give us a clear, detailed, and complete account of the vices of the court and the great, of the ferocity or corruption of the nobles, and of the servility of the people, we are astonished to find the poets, after a long lapse of time, adorning the very same ages with the most splendid fictions of grace, virtue, and loyalty. The Romance writers of the twelfth century placed the age of chivalry in the time of Charlemagne. The period when these writers existed, is the time pointed out by Francis I. At the present day , we imagine we can still see chivalry flourishing in the persons of Du Guesclin and Bayard, under Charles V and Francis I. But when we come to examine either the one period or the other, although we find in each some heroic spirits, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>forced</b> to confess {{that it is necessary to}} antedate the age of chivalry, at least three or four centuries before any period of authentic history.|$|E

500|$|For {{his strong}} {{performance}} {{during the first}} half of the season, Hamels was, for the first time in his career, selected a member of the NL All Star Team. As Hamels had been the Phillies only consistent starter to that point, even to the point that one columnist said the Phillies are a joke [...] "as long as <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>forced</b> to look forward to someone other than Cole Hamels on the mound", the Phillies acquired Kyle Lohse to supplement the rotation soon before the trading deadline. Several weeks later, Hamels was placed on the 15-day disabled list (DL) with a mild left elbow strain. After the Phillies activated him from the DL, on September 28, he helped the Phillies take over first place in the National League East by striking out 13 Washington Nationals over 8 innings in a 6–0 win. Two days later, the team clinched a spot in the playoffs for the first time in 14 years. In the first game of the National League Division Series, he started for the Phillies, but surrendered three runs, three hits, and an [...] "uncharacteristic" [...] four walks, while striking out seven in 6 innings; he was assessed the loss. Ultimately, the Phillies lost the series. Hamels finished with a regular-season record of 15–5, a 3.39 ERA, and 177 strikeouts in 183 [...] innings.

The EBU had requested the Romanian government to repay the debt before 20 April or face exclusion from the contest. The EBU announced on 22 April that after the Romanian government had failed to repay the debt by the deadline, TVR were forced to withdraw from the EBU, consequently forcing the withdrawal of Romania from the contest.

2500|$|Singer was {{a speaker}} at the 2012 Global Atheist Convention. He has debated with Christians such as John Lennox and Dinesh D'Souza. Singer has pointed out the problem of evil as an {{objection}} against the Christian conception of God. He stated: [...] "The evidence of our own eyes makes it more plausible {{to believe that the}} world was not created by any god at all. If, however, we insist on believing in divine creation, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>forced</b> to admit that the god who made the world cannot be all-powerful and all good. He must be either evil or a bungler." [...] In keeping with his considerations of non-human animals, Singer also takes issue with the original sin reply to the problem of evil, saying that, [...] "animals also suffer from floods, fires, and droughts, and, since they are not descended from Adam and Eve, they cannot have inherited original sin." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig argue that, if {{we accept}} Searle's {{description}} of intentionality, consciousness and the mind, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>forced</b> to accept that consciousness is [...] epiphenomenal: that it [...] "casts no shadow", that it is undetectable in the outside world. They argue that Searle must be mistaken about the [...] "knowability of the mental", and in his belief that there are [...] "causal properties" [...] in our neurons {{that give rise to}} the mind. They point out that, by Searle's own description, these causal properties can't be detected by anyone outside the mind, otherwise the Chinese Room couldn't pass the Turing test—the people outside would be able to tell there wasn't a Chinese speaker in the room by detecting their causal properties. Since they can't detect causal properties, they can't detect the existence of the mental. In short, Searle's [...] "causal properties" [...] and consciousness itself is undetectable, and anything that cannot be detected either does not exist or does not matter.|$|E
2500|$|Moravia once {{remarked that}} the most {{important}} facts of his life had been his illness, a tubercular infection of the bones that confined him to a bed for five years and Fascism, because they both caused him to suffer and do things he otherwise would not have done. [...] "It is what <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>forced</b> to do that forms our character, not what we do of our own free will." [...] Moravia was an atheist. His writing was marked by its factual, cold, precise style, often depicting the malaise of the bourgeoisie. It was rooted in the tradition of nineteenth-century narrative, underpinned by high social and cultural awareness. Moravia believed that writers must, if they were to represent reality, [...] "assume a moral position, a clearly conceived political, social, and philosophical attitude" [...] but also that, ultimately, [...] "A writer survives in spite of his beliefs". Between 1959 and 1962 Moravia was president of PEN International, the worldwide association of writers.|$|E

2500|$|Quantum physics works {{differently}} {{in many ways}} from Newtonian physics. Physicist Aaron D. O'Connell explains that understanding our universe, at such small scales as atoms, requires a different logic than day-to-day life does. O'Connell does not deny that it is all interconnected: the scale of human existence ultimately does emerge from the quantum scale. O'Connell argues that we must simply use different models and constructs when dealing with the quantum world. Quantum mechanics {{is the product of}} a careful application of the scientific method, logic and empiricism. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle is frequently confused with the observer effect. The uncertainty principle actually describes how precisely we may measure the position and momentum of a particle at the same time [...] if we increase the accuracy in measuring one quantity, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>forced</b> to lose accuracy in measuring the other. [...] "These uncertainty relations give us that measure of freedom from the limitations of classical concepts which is necessary for a consistent description of atomic processes." ...|$|E

As he expected, Jiang Wei crossed the river to attack Taocheng, but failed to capture the fortress because Deng Ai had already strengthened its defences. Faced with no other viable options, Jiang Wei withdrew his forces back to Shu.|$|E
