5|$|An {{agreement}} was {{made between the}} ministry, the tunnel company and the county municipality on 6 January 1994 to build the tunnel.

The construction would be the responsibility of Hordaland Public Roads Administration, with the tunnel company only responsible for their part of the financing and the collection of tolls. An {{agreement was}} made with Selmer, whereby they would charge NOK59,422,500 and take the risk of the project, including any expenditures for unknown geological conditions or similar costs increases. They were also responsible for an insurance to reclaim the investments should it be proven impossible to build the tunnel.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1910s, a {{passable}} {{dirt and}} gravel road connected Ukiah and Nevada City via the south side of Clear Lake and Marysville. The portion between Lower Lake and Wilbur Springs was impassable in wet weather, at which times the Bartlett Springs and Bear Valley Toll-road via Upper Lake and Bartlett Springs was available for $1.50 each way or $2.50 round trip. This route generally followed the present SR 20, except around Clear Lake and between Marysville and Rough and Ready (where it used Spenceville Road). Beyond Nevada City to Emigrant Gap, the old turnpike was not passable; instead the present SR 174 was available for eastward drivers. Between Williams and Colusa, the road was paved in concrete, as it had been added to the state highway system as part of the first (1910) bond issue, specifically as Route 15, connecting the west Sacramento Valley trunk (Route 7, now I-5) <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>county</b> seat of Colusa.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, the Miami Urban Area Transportation Study {{completed}} by the Dade County metropolitan planning organization recommended the construction for a rapid transit system for Greater Miami. Having experienced a prolonged post-World War II population boom, metropolitan Dade County's permanent population rose by 35% to nearly 1.3 million residents within a decade, among the fastest population growth rates in the United States. Within a year of the study, county residents approved a $132.5 million ($ million, adjusted for current inflation) bond dedicated to transit, with additional funding approved by the Florida Legislature for transit which, up until that time, operated solely on fare revenue. In 1976, with preliminary engineering completed for the system, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA, then, the Urban Mass Transit Administration) committed 80% of the costs for {{the first stage of}} rapid transit system, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>county</b> and state incurring the remaining cost. In the end the system cost over a billion dollars.|$|E

5|$|Today, {{the duties}} of the sheriff include law {{enforcement}} services of the two county courthouses and surrounding property, service of court-ordered warrants, writs, protective orders, and other injunctions, and limited patrol responsibility <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>County</b> Police. The Domestic Violence Unit has expanded its role in the county to include responding to calls for service that are domestic-related. The creation of the School Resource Deputy division has placed a deputy sheriff at all of the local high schools, replacing the County Police. All other law enforcement services of the county are provided by multiple agencies but mostly left to the separate Prince George's County Police Department (PGPD), though some responsibilities are shared by both agencies. The PGSO, like most other county-level law enforcement agencies in the United States, is a progressive agency with an array of services in tom a Specialized Services Team dealing with high-risk arrest warrants and barricaded situations to community services aiding the county's residents in safety education. Although the agency is not yet nationally accredited, it currently has a unit dedicated to accreditation.|$|E
5|$|While {{serving as}} the Eton coach, Hirst also worked with young Yorkshire players during the school holidays, and {{maintained}} his coaching connection <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>county</b> until shortly before his death. Despite {{the differences in the}} backgrounds of the players, Hirst was equally respected at Eton and when he acted as a coach to the Yorkshire team. At Yorkshire Hirst worked with young players in the cricket nets at Headingley, took charge of indoor trials during the winter, and travelled with the team as coach on a tour to Jamaica in 1936. Many Yorkshire players, with vastly differing temperaments, came under his influence and improved as players. One of Hirst's most notable achievements as a coach was improving the bowling of George Macaulay {{to the point where he}} became a key member of the Yorkshire team.|$|E
5|$|Schuster also {{assisted}} Birkenhead in {{his attempts}} to reform {{the administration of the}} court system, particularly in his preparation of the Supreme Court (Consolidation) Act 1925. A committee was also set up to look into the reform of the Supreme Court, the County Courts and the Probate Services, divided into a subcommittee for each institution. Schuster served {{as a member of the}} committee, with his primary goal being to end the patronage and nepotism that filled the judicial system. Although the Supreme Court was resistant the committee did succeed in making some changes, such as introducing mandatory retirement ages for masters and clerks; they were unable, however, to end the patronage. Schuster also attempted to reform the County Courts by increasing their jurisdiction, and a Committee on County Court Procedure (known as the Swift Committee after its chairman Rigby Swift) was set up in 1920, with Schuster serving as a member. The commission concluded that HM Treasury had mismanaged the County Courts, and on 1 August 1922 the Lord Chancellor's Office instead became responsible for the courts, with Schuster becoming Accounting Officer. The committee's final report was used as the basis for the County Courts Act 1924, which did much to correct the problems <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>County</b> Courts. Schuster was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in the 1920 New Year War Honours.|$|E

5|$|The {{rest of the}} 13th {{century was}} {{relatively}} peaceful, and records show that Peveril Castle was maintained by the Crown. In 1235, {{in preparation for the}} king's visit, the north wall and bridge were repaired. After significant work in 1250–52 (£60 spent), 1272–1275 (£40) and 1288–1290 (£151), {{it is likely that the}} castle buildings were complete by 1300. King Henry gave Prince Edward (later King EdwardI) Peveril Castle along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>County</b> Palatine of Chester with the royal holdings in Wales and Ireland. Some of the lands, including Peveril, were made part of Eleanor of Castile's dower, to come into her possession should her husband, Prince Edward, die. At this time, the Peak lordship was worth around £300 a year. At the outbreak of the Second Barons' War in 1264, Peveril Castle was occupied by Robert de Ferrers, 6th Earl of Derby. Simon de Montfort pressured King HenryIII into giving him Peveril, although it was recovered by the Crown after De Montfort's death in 1265. The castle was returned to Eleanor's dower, and as she predeceased her husband the lordship returned into royal hands. Its income was used to provide for members of the royal family such as King EdwardII's queen, Isabella of France, and their children, and royal favourites such as Piers Gaveston. In 1331 EdwardIII gave the lordship to his wife, Philippa of Hainault. It was given to John de Warenne, 7th Earl of Surrey, in 1345. After its return to the Crown, the estate was given to John of Gaunt, EdwardIII's third surviving son, partially in exchange for the Earldom of Richmond.|$|E
