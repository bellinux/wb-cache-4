5|$|John Jackson, Patrick Martin and Harriet Hughes, {{all members}} of the Countryside Alliance, sought {{judicial}} review of the use of the Parliament Acts to pass the Hunting Act. They claimed that the 1949 Act had not been lawfully passed either because the 1911 Act could not be used to amend itself or because it provided a method of making delegated or subordinate legislation which could not alter the process of legislating. Consequently, they claimed, the 1949 Act had not reduced the delay specified in the 1911 Act and the Hunting Act, which was passed only in accordance <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> as amended by the 1949 Act, was invalid.|$|E
5|$|Private {{associations}} and country clubs have no obvious public law function, yet the courts exercise judicial review over their decisions and proceedings, such as hearings relating to disciplinary matters and those held {{to decide if}} persons should be deprived of their memberships in the associations, {{to ensure that they}} are fair and comply <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> of natural justice. It has been suggested that the courts' jurisdiction in such matters depends on contract. The rules of an association form a contract between the members of the association themselves, and the need for hearings to be conducted in accordance with natural justice is an implied term in the contract. Accordingly, the courts are merely enforcing the contract rather than exercising a judicial review function.|$|E

5|$|The western jackdaw {{is one of}} a {{very small}} number of birds that it is legal to use as a decoy or to trap in a cage in the United Kingdom. The other pest species that can be {{controlled}} by trapping are the crow, jay, magpie and rook. An authorised person must comply <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and does not need to show that the birds were a nuisance before trapping them. As of 2003 the western jackdaw was listed as a potential species for targeted hunting in the European Union Birds Directive, and hunting has been encouraged by German hunting associations. Permission to shoot western jackdaws in spring and summer exists in Cyprus as they are thought (incorrectly) to prey on gamebirds.|$|E
5|$|On 6December1961, {{prior to}} the design being {{submitted}} to NATO, {{it was decided that}} the P.1154 would be developed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> for use by both the RAF and the Royal Navy. In February1962, the Royal Navy's Admiralty received the aircraft concept with great interest as the Royal Navy {{was in the process of}} seeking a new interceptor aircraft for use on their aircraft carriers at the time. By March 1962, the Ministry of Defence was openly interested in the potential for the P.1154 being adopted as a replacement for both the RAF's fleet of Hawker Hunters and the Royal Navy's de Havilland Sea Vixens. Accordingly, in April 1962, a first draft of a new joint Naval/Air Staff requirement was issued in the form of Specification OR356/AW406, to which HSA had submitted a response by June of that year. Following the cancellation of the NBMR-3 requirement, HSA focused all its attention onto working upon this joint requirement.|$|E
5|$|The Government {{sought to}} use the MirageIII {{replacement}} program {{as a means to}} increase the capabilities of Australia's manufacturing industry. Accordingly, it was decided to build the aircraft in Australia, though it was recognised that this would lead to higher costs than if the fighters were purchased directly from the United States. While the first two RAAF Hornets were built in the United States, the remainder were assembled at the Government Aircraft Factories plant at Avalon Airport in Victoria, and their engines were produced by the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation at Fishermans Bend in Melbourne. Another twelve Australian companies were involved in other stages of the project. These firms were sub-contracted to McDonnell Douglas and the other major US companies that produced components for the F/A-18, and had to comply <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> of the FMS program. The Australian Government hoped that Singapore and New Zealand would purchase Australian-built Hornets, but this did not eventuate. The Canadian Government expressed interest in purchasing 25 Australian-built F/A-18As in 1988 in order to increase its force of these aircraft after they had ceased to be manufactured in the United States, but this did not lead to any sales.|$|E

5|$|The {{battalion}} {{was withdrawn}} back to Australia in early 1944 for rest and reorganisation. During this period it was stationed at Tenterfield, where the soldiers experienced a bitterly cold winter, {{before moving to}} Petrie and then Kiari on the Atherton Tablelands. The battalion was reorganised to conform <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> of the jungle divisional establishment, {{and as a result}} its vehicles were changed to include jeeps and trailers, instead of trucks, which were considered impractical in the jungle. A change of commanding officer also took place in this time, with Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Haupt– who had previously served as battalion second-in-command before leaving to take over command of the 62nd Battalion in January 1943– returning to take over from Fidock. A long period of training, which included courses in amphibious warfare and various jungle exercises followed, as the focus of the fighting in the Pacific shifted away from Australian forces towards the US military. Consequently, it was not until close {{to the end of the}} war that the battalion went into action again. Before this, the battalion contributed to an Australian contingent that was sent to India to lecture British Army officers on the lessons of jungle warfare.|$|E
5|$|The {{difficulty}} {{of handling the}} divergent requirements was compounded when, in May 1963, shortly following on from the official issuing of Specification OR356/AW406, the option of having two distinct aircraft was rejected; the Secretary of State for Defence, Peter Thorneycroft, had insisted upon {{the development of a}} single common aircraft to meet the requirements of both services. According to Woods, Thorneycroft's decision had been influenced by the American General Dynamics F-111 multirole program, and had sought to duplicate this development concept for the P.1154. Despite a stated Navy preference for a swing-wing fighter, the services agreed that the aircraft would be completely common, with the exception of different radar systems. However, upon requests by various electronics manufacturers to the Ministry of Aviation to be issued <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> for the electronics fit, no response was ever issued; this lack of leadership proved disruptive to the overall programme.|$|E

40|$|While {{land title}} {{formalization}} is still useful in sub-Saharan Africa, Ghana {{like many other}} countries in the sub-region, continues to experience low rate of compliance <b>with</b> <b>the</b> legal title formalization requirement. This is in spite of over a century and half duration of its practices. Administrative inertia, complex title formalization procedures, and the high cost of formalization are usually adduced for this low compliance rate. That notwithstanding, it is suggested that lack of awareness of the legal title formalization requirement and poor perception of relevance for formalization are additional major determinants. Yet the relationship between these factors and compliance <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>requirement</b> still begs empirical examination. This study examines the link between awareness of <b>the</b> <b>requirement</b> and relevance for formalization on one hand, and compliance <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>requirement</b> on <b>the</b> other. The primary aim is to establish {{the extent to which these}} independent variables determine compliance <b>with</b> <b>the</b> title formalization <b>requirement.</b> Data was collected from residential property owners in Kwabenya, a suburb of Accra, Ghana. The study established that awareness of <b>the</b> <b>requirement</b> and relevance for title formalization are not strong predictors of compliance <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>requirement.</b> It also found that low compliance <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>requirement</b> stems from <b>the</b> fact that the current title formalization system favors the highly educated formal sector employees who can manipulate the system. As such, it is recommended that the on-going Land Administration Project should seek to review the system to make it effective and efficient, and ultimately receptive to all and sundry...|$|R
