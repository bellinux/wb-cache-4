25|$|The 2008 novel Ich werde hier sein im Sonnenschein und im Schatten (I <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>here,</b> in {{sunshine}} and in shadow) imagines an alternative {{history of the}} twentieth century in which Lenin never returned to Russia from Switzerland, but instead founded a Swiss Soviet Republic - a Communist state engaged in the colonisation of Africa and in perpetual war with other totalitarian empires, notably with a federation of British and German fascists. Channeling Philip K. Dick's The Man in the High Castle and Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now, the plot of the novel traces a black Swiss political commissar's journey {{to the heart of the}} empire to arrest the rogue officer Brazhinsky in an Alpine tunnel complex called the Réduit.|$|E

[...] Joyce Millman of Salon.com stated that she disliked Seinfelds pilot episode, but after seeing a scene from [...] "The Ex-Girlfriend" [...] in which Jerry and Kramer discuss returning fruit, she was [...] "awed by Seinfeld and co-creator/writer Larry David's brilliant grasp of, A) working-class Jewish craziness, and, B) the absurd humor of the deeply mundane." ...|$|E
500|$|As the band's primary lyricist, McIlrath is {{wary of the}} {{political}} label. [...] "In this sort of current climate of music, we stand out simply because I think there are bands that are avoiding the question. So, it makes us sort of an anomaly and I think that’s where we get the tag 'protest music' or 'political punk rock'". He also noted how the band's lyrics discuss social topics in general terms, instead of delving into the specifics. In a 2006 interview, McIlrath said: [...] "I {{think that a lot}} of the problems we deal with today in the world are the ones that have been plaguing society for centuries and probably <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> a hundred years from now...There's a bigger picture than just the Bush administration and specific problems of 2006, and I want people to relate to that, even if they're listening to [...] 10 years from now." [...] Principe noted the band does not try to preach their beliefs, but instead encourage listeners to become involved, and learn about pertinent issues affecting society.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the song, {{the lyrics}} {{seemingly}} show the evolving {{relationship between the}} couple. Carey sings Anytime you need a friend / I <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> / You'll never be alone again / So don't you fear / Even if you're miles away / I'm by your side / So don't you ever be lonely / Love will make it alright, which hints at a current friendship where more still uncovered emotions are present. Author Chris Nickson explains on the song's switch in relationship, as the lyrics change to If you just believe in me / I will love you endlessly / Take my hand / Take me into your heart / I'll be there forever baby / I won't let go / I'll never let go. The protagonist is {{willing to accept the}} relationship as only a friend, but tells her partner that no matter his feelings for her, she loves him and still wishes to be loved by him, something she will never forget or [...] "let go".|$|E

[...] Writing for The Spokesman-Review, critic Jon Burlingame stated that [...] "Seinfeld is an offbeat take on the standard sitcom concept. While rarely hilarious, it's often smart and amusing." [...] Dave Kehr of The New York Times felt that [...] "The Pony Remark" [...] was a turning point for the show, noting that after the first few episodes, the show [...] "turn into something sharp and distinctive [...] Here, suddenly, is the tight knot of guilt and denial, of hypersensitivity and sarcastic contempt that Seinfeld would explore for the next eight years."
