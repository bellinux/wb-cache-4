40|$|This diploma {{thesis is}} focused on {{structural}} progression of massive <b>wooden</b> <b>structures,</b> requirements to contemporary massive <b>wooden</b> <b>structures,</b> development of carpentry joints and connecting instruments used in constructions and reconstructions of these buildings, and analysis of risks connected with reconstructions of selected historical <b>wooden</b> <b>structures.</b> Another item of this thesis concerns on evaluation of possible risks in particular connecting instruments {{that are used in}} massive <b>wooden</b> <b>structures</b> per the FMEA method. The main content of thesis includes a description of selected historical <b>wooden</b> <b>structures,</b> options of their damages, forms of remediation and a description of possible risks and measures in reconstructions. In conclusion the thesis focuses on comparison of historical massive <b>wooden</b> <b>structures</b> and comparable new buildings...|$|R

The {{cylinder}} of the main dome is built in brick; the rest is a <b>wooden</b> <b>structure</b> covered in copper plates. The tower domes also are built with a <b>wooden</b> <b>structure</b> covered in copper plates, but these plates appear silver on the outside.|$|R

To increase the number of fire-retardant <b>wooden</b> <b>structures,</b> a reduction in the cost of fire-retardant products is essential.|$|R

40|$|In Japan, {{there has}} existed {{a serious problem}} on seismic {{retrofit}} {{for a lot of}} one-story <b>wooden</b> <b>structures</b> such as temples and shrines in famous tourist resort areas, which were built by a Japanese traditional framedconstruction method and have some types of thatched roof instead of tiles. In order to investigate the seismic behaviour of an old one-story thatched roof <b>wooden</b> <b>structure,</b> “Yakushi-doh”, 3 -D non-linear collapsing process analysis of Yakushi-doh structure was conducted against a strong earthquake ground motion with the Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity of “ 6 upper” level. A non-linear behaviour of timber elements in the <b>wooden</b> <b>structure</b> during a strong earthquake ground motion can be simulated by this 3 -D non-linear collapsing process analysis based on the Distinct Element Method. The effect of the post fixing condition under <b>wooden</b> <b>structure</b> floor on seismic response of Yakushi-doh structure was numerically investigated in this paper...|$|R

Special {{attention is paid to}} outer wall systems of <b>wooden</b> <b>structures</b> and to the location of insulation: systems with interjacent thermal insulation, systems with outer insulation, and combined systems. Finally, thermal insulation materials are assessed on selected model walls regarding the heat transmission, heat accumulation, and ecological footprint.
