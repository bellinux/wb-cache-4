25|$|Stevens (1982) {{suggests}} that ethology and analytical psychology are both disciplines trying to comprehend universal phenomena. Ethology {{shows us that}} each species is equipped with unique behavioural capacities that are adapted to its environment and 'even allowing for our greater adaptive flexibility, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> exception. Archetypes are the neuropsychic centres responsible for co-ordinating the behavioural and psychic repertoire of our species'. Following Bowlby, Stevens points out that genetically programmed behaviour {{is taking place in}} the psychological relationship between mother and newborn. The baby's helplessness, its immense repertoire of sign stimuli and approach behaviour, triggers a maternal response. And the smell, sound and shape of mother triggers, for instance, a feeding response.|$|E

There are reports of some beekeepers losing {{almost a third of}} their hives and others losing none." [...] John Chapple, chairman of the London Beekeepers' Association, put losses among his 150 members at between a fifth and a quarter. [...] "There {{are still a lot of}} mysterious disappearances; <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> nearer to knowing what is causing them." [...] The government's National Bee Unit continued to deny the existence of CCD in Britain; it attributes the heavy losses to the varroa mite and rainy summers that stop bees foraging for food.|$|E

At the same time, he lamented what he {{perceived}} as poor treatment of the state as disloyal by the Federal government. He cited examples such as the declaration of martial law in the Commonwealth and the suspension {{of the right of}} habeas corpus for its citizens. He answered President Lincoln's contention [...] "that military necessity is not to be measured by Constitutional limits" [...] by warning [...] "If military necessity is not to be measured by Constitutional limits, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> longer a free people." ...|$|E

500|$|During the 1890s, Walker became {{active in}} politics. [...] Walker's {{activism}} was heightened by {{an incident in}} June 1897 in which residents of Urbana, Ohio, formed a lynch mob, removed a black man named [...] "Click" [...] Mitchell from the town jail, and publicly killed him by hanging. [...] Believing that Ohio's Republican Governor Asa Bushnell had failed to conduct an appropriate investigation into the lynching, Walker and other African Americans in Ohio left the Republican Party and formed the Negro Protective Party. [...] As {{a member of the}} party's Executive Committee, Walker helped organize the party's convention at Columbus, Ohio in September 1897. [...] The party adopted a platform demanding [...] "an immediate recognition of our rights as citizens such as have been repeatedly pledged and as often violated," [...] and declaring an intention [...] "to take immediate political action that we may show to the world that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> longer the plaything of politicians or chattels for sale to the highest bidder." [...] The party also began publishing [...] "The Negro Protector" [...] as its official organ. [...] When former slave and Republican Party official, Nelson T. Gant, attacked Walker and the Negro Protective Party, Walker responded with an open letter that was published in Ohio newspapers. [...] In the letter, Walker wrote:Notwithstanding N. T. Gant there are many [...] "intelligent Negroes" [...] who will support the Negro protective ticket and will hurl back at him with contempt his insults to their manhood that they are not free to leave the republican party without being branded as [...] "betrayers of their party" [...] and [...] "ungrateful to their Creator and their race." [...] Such fumings are manifestly the strongest evidence of an enslaved mind... Republicans... believe, or make pretense of believing, that the Negro owes eternal allegiance to the G. O. P. no matter what the issue... We shall not trespass further upon your valuable space, except to say that the Negro Protective party will live and its supporters hope never to regret the stand taken for free and independent manhood as a protest against every disregard, from whatever source, of the rights and privileges of the Negro as an American citizen.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the same}} time, Richard North {{argues that the}} Beowulf poet {{interpreted}} [...] "Danish myths in Christian form" [...] (as the poem would {{have served as a}} form of entertainment for a Christian audience), and states: [...] "As yet <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> closer to finding out why the first audience of Beowulf liked to hear stories about people routinely classified as damned. This question is pressing, given... that Anglo-Saxons saw the Danes as 's' rather than as foreigners." [...] Grendel's mother and Grendel are described as descendants of Cain, a fact which some scholars link to the Cain tradition.|$|E

2500|$|Einstein {{proposed}} that spacetime is curved by matter, and that free-falling objects are moving along locally straight paths in curved spacetime. These straight paths are called geodesics. Like Newton's first law of motion, Einstein's theory states {{that if a}} force is applied on an object, it would deviate from a geodesic. [...] For instance, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> longer following geodesics while standing because the mechanical resistance of the Earth exerts an upward force on us, and we are non-inertial {{on the ground as}} a result. This explains why moving along the geodesics in spacetime is considered inertial.|$|E

2500|$|Within Temptation is a Dutch symphonic metal band {{founded in}} April 1996 by vocalist Sharon den Adel and guitarist Robert Westerholt. They {{have always been}} {{classified}} by critics as gothic metal, although the [...] "gothic" [...] influence varies with each album. Their most prominent and well-known sound is described as symphonic metal, although their earlier material, such as debut album Enter, was mostly gothic metal. Enter even had a hint of doom metal. In an interview, Den Adel said they fell into a symphonic rock genre with various influences. In a later interview with Dutch music platform 3VOOR12, den Adel stated that [...] "we consider ourselves more a symphonic rock band ... in my opinion, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> gothic band".|$|E

[...] He said that Catholics accounted for 17.4 percent of the world population—a stable percentage—while Muslims were at 19.2 percent. [...] "It is true that while Muslim families, as is well known, continue to make a lot of children, Christian ones on the contrary tend to have fewer and fewer," [...] the monsignor said. Muslims in 2010 represented as much as 23.4% of the total world population and this is expected to increase to 26.3% by 2030.|$|E

We are fighting against a new form of poverty, one caused by the unsustainable path of development that we, as a species, have chosen to embark on.

2500|$|Originally {{the text}} read that God {{has not made}} us like the nations who [...] "bow down to nothingness and vanity, and pray to an {{impotent}} god." ... In the Middle Ages these words were censored, since the church believed they were an insult to Christianity. Omitting them tends {{to give the impression}} that the Aleinu teaches that we are both different and better than others. The actual intent is to say that we are thankful that God has enlightened us so that, unlike the pagans, we worship the true God and not idols. There is no inherent superiority in being Jewish, but we do assert the superiority of monotheistic belief over paganism. Although paganism still exists today, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> longer the only ones to have a belief in one God.|$|E

2500|$|Epicurus' {{philosophy}} {{is based on}} the theory that all good and bad derive from the sensations of what he defined as pleasure and pain: What is good is what is pleasurable, and what is bad is what is painful. His ideas of pleasure and pain were ultimately, for Epicurus, the basis for the moral distinction between good and evil. If pain is chosen over pleasure in some cases it is only because it leads to a greater pleasure. Although Epicurus has been commonly misunderstood to advocate the rampant pursuit of pleasure, his teachings were more about striving for an absence of pain and suffering, both physical and mental, and a state of satiation and tranquillity that was free of the fear of death and the retribution of the gods. Epicurus argued that when we do not suffer pain, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> longer in need of pleasure, and we enter a state of ataraxia, [...] "tranquillity of soul" [...] or [...] "imperturbability".|$|E
2500|$|McManaman {{had also}} been noted for his {{versatility}} in his free role, switching {{from right to left}} wings, and his ability to play in central midfield, behind the front pair, or as a forward, with many notable managers including then Ajax coach Louis van Gaal, describing it as a role few could pull off the way McManaman had. McManaman was credited for making the role manager Evans gave him work, with the result being that Liverpool were playing some of the most aesthetically pleasing attacking football at the time in England. McManaman was also said to have been {{one of only a handful}} of so-called [...] "talismanic" [...] players along with Eric Cantona and Gianfranco Zola in the league at the time believed to have the charisma to lift supporters from their seats each time they got the ball. Managers would deploy a man-marker specifically to follow him for an entire game, with Gianfranco Zola noting that McManaman was the player the Italian national players monitored the most. Howard Wilkinson said McManaman was [...] "virtually unstoppable" [...] at times, while then Middlesbrough manager, Bryan Robson, was quoted as saying that [...] "everyone in the Premiership knows that if you stop McManaman, you stop Liverpool". Roy Evans, attempting to diminish the attention on marking McManaman, stated, [...] "I would hate to think <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> more than a one-man team." [...] German coach Berti Vogts named McManaman as one of only three Premiership players in his select European XI Team.|$|E
