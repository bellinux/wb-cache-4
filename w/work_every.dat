Oh, I'd relieve all right, plenty of times, but I went right from the bench to the box, and I'd take a few warm-up pitches and be ready. Then I had good control. I aimed to make the batter hit the ball, and I threw as few pitches as possible. That's why I was able to <b>work</b> <b>every</b> other day.|$|E

25|$|Formed in 1973, PSFC {{has grown}} to include over 17,000 members. The PSFC {{business}} model requires each of its adult members to contribute 2 hours and 45 minutes of <b>work</b> <b>every</b> four weeks, and that no member share a household with a non-member. In exchange, active members may shop at the store. The store sells a variety of foods and household goods, mostly environmentally friendly products, at a 21% markup over the wholesale price (compared to 26-100% at a supermarket). The savings are possible because labor is contributed by its members. PSFC operates as a New York state cooperative corporation.|$|E
25|$|The Dual Contracts {{resulted}} in the expansion of New York City; people moved to the newly built homes along the newly built subway lines. These homes were affordable, about the same cost as the houses in Brooklyn and Manhattan. The Dual Contracts were the key to dispersion of the city’s congested areas. They helped lower high population areas and probably helped saves lives as people were no longer living in heavily diseased areas. The population in Manhattan below 59th Street decreased between the years of 1910 and 1920. People were allowed to move to better parts the same cost and could have a better and more comfortable life in the suburbs. They could still commute to <b>work</b> <b>every</b> day {{as most of the}} better off city workers who moved to the outer boroughs did.|$|E
25|$|Renames {{are handled}} implicitly rather than explicitly. A common {{complaint}} with CVS {{is that it}} uses {{the name of a}} file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an inode number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage. Source code files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed, and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history. Git addresses the issue by detecting renames while browsing the history of snapshots rather than recording it when making the snapshot. to show code moved between source files (Briefly, given a file in revision N, a file of the same name in revision N−1 is its default ancestor. However, when there is no like-named file in revision N−1, Git searches for a file that existed only in revision N−1 and is very similar to the new file.) However, it does require more CPU-intensive <b>work</b> <b>every</b> time history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file {{and the creation of a}} new file. Developers can work around this limitation by committing the rename and changes separately.|$|E

King Mongkut had sought a Briton to teach his children and wives after trying local missionaries, who used the opportunity to proselytize. Leonowens initially asked for $150 in Singapore currency per month. Her additional request, to live {{in or near the}} missionary community to ensure she was not deprived of Western company, aroused suspicion in Mongkut, who cautioned in a letter, [...] "we need not have teacher of Christianity as they are abundant here".

At a time when most transport in Bangkok was by boat, Mongkut did not wish to have to arrange for the teacher to get to <b>work</b> <b>every</b> day.

500|$|Andrew Keir as Professor Bernard Quatermass: Nigel Kneale {{had long}} been highly {{critical}} of Brian Donlevy's interpretation of Quatermass and lobbied for the role to be recast, arguing that enough time had passed that audiences would not resist a change of actor. A number of actors were considered for the part including André Morell who had played Quatermass in the television version of Quatermass and the Pit. However, Morell {{was not interested in}} revisiting a role he had already played. The producers eventually settled on Scottish actor Andrew Keir who had appeared in supporting roles in a number of Hammer productions including The Pirates of Blood River (1962), The Devil-Ship Pirates (1964) and [...] (1966). Keir found the shoot an unhappy experience: he later recalled, “The director – Roy Ward Baker – didn't want me for the role. He wanted Kenneth More... {{and it was a very}} unhappy shoot. [...] Normally I enjoy going to <b>work</b> <b>every</b> day.

Perhaps I should have interfered more.” Keir went on to appear for Hammer in The Viking Queen (1967) and Blood from the Mummy's Tomb (1971).
