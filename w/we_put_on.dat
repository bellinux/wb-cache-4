5|$|I {{think that}} the band went on... maybe not a tangent, {{but we had a}} goal in mind, {{and at the end of}} the {{recording}} process, we were so proud of how artistic we were. And I think we showed too much. I think maybe we were a little too jaded and a little too dark, and I {{think that the}} lack of hope and faith that <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> this record made us a little less sparkly and light to people. But I think that it's all part of our evolution. We all went a bit too far.|$|E
500|$|Captain America's shield, {{which serves}} as both a {{defensive}} tool and a weapon, came in four types: metal, fiberglass, rubber, and computer graphics (CG). Prop master Barry Gibbs specified that [...] "We had the 'hero shield,' which was made of aluminum, for our beauty shots [...] close-up work. We then created a lighter shield that was aluminum-faced with a fiberglass back, for use on a daily basis.... And then we had a stunt shield made of polyurethane, {{which is sort of}} a synthetic rubber... and we made an ultrasoft one <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> [...] back, so that if there were an accident, it wouldn't hurt him." [...] Visual effects supervisor Christopher Townsend said Evans [...] "would practice swinging the practical shield so he knew the arc and the speed at which he should move. We would take the shield from him and shoot the scene with him miming it. Then we would add in a CG shield".|$|E
2500|$|Dave Brock {{explained}} their {{method of}} working as [...] "we recorded bass, guitar, drums and vocals together, so it's as live {{as it can}} be, and then <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> the other things afterwards... We just let the tapes run and play like we do when we're playing live; do a three-hour track and then cut it up into pieces, use one piece as a complete section, and join it up to another piece with a synthesiser link or something... It's improvised, but it's together in the first place." ...|$|E

2500|$|Production on {{the album}} was difficult. A.C. Newman stated, [...] "I {{remember}} 'Letter From an Occupant' was a pretty belabored song. It ended up being almost minimal, but I remember there's so much shit <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> it. There's a psychedelic 12-string guitar solo, a backwards guitar, there's a kind of really cool synth that's in there but buried. At some point, you have to choose. That was the hardest part about mixing the thing: just making that judgment call. I only feel at peace with the record now because people seem to like it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Defensively, {{the game}} was a {{disappointment}} for Michigan. [...] Wisconsin's 27 points was the most allowed by a Michigan team since 1969, and Wisconsin's 426 yards of offense was the most allowed by Michigan since before Bo Schembechler took over as head coach. [...] After the game, Schembechler told the press: [...] "Twenty seven points that's what we usually give {{up in the first}} half of the season. [...] I wasn't happy with the movement, I wasn't happy with the pursuit, I wasn't happy with the tackling, I wasn't happy with the playing of the ball in the secondary and I wasn't happy with the heat <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> the passer." ...|$|E
2500|$|Geoff Lawson was {{unavailable}} to play {{due to a}} back injury. Leg-spinner Bob Holland was overlooked for selection despite taking more first class wickets that summer than any other bowler. The writers of Wisden later argued this was a major mistake. Bill O'Reilly was delighted with the selections of Steve Waugh ("one of the best selections in the whole era of Greg Chappell's career at the selection committee's wheel") and Bruce Reid ("strong claims to be recognised as the finest left-arm speedster <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> the international arena since Alan Davidson"), but was disappointed {{in the selection of}} Ray Bright over Holland, and Greg Ritchie over Mark O'Neill: ...|$|E

2500|$|The most {{perceptible}} {{element of}} de Forest's design aesthetic in the Deanery is his stenciling, a technique for which his Indian workshop was known. Geometric designs were stenciled {{on the walls}} or on the ceilings throughout the house, as, for example, on {{the ceiling of the}} Blue Room, as an upper border in the dining room, a mid-height border in the corridor between the studies, and as an upper border and on the ceiling in Mamie Gwinn's study. Even the floors of the dining room were stenciled, as Thomas noted in a letter to de Forest: [...] "You remember it was so with my dining room. In four years the stenciling under the wax which <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> the floors was entirely worn off." [...] Several pieces of furniture were also transformed into [...] "art furniture" [...] by the addition of stenciled designs, possibly as a cost-saving measure, as the 1894–1896 renovations cost over $14,000.|$|E
2500|$|When the two steamers {{began their}} journey {{down the coast}} again, it wasn't long before they found three of the prahus. The water was shallow that the Rainbow had the Jolly Bachelor in tow and her captain, the rajah mudah, {{intended}} to release the other ship {{as soon as they}} were in a good firing position. Brooke then asked his Sarawakian followers if the three vessels in front of him were that of pirates, to be sure, and they said yes, so as soon as the Sulus realised they were under attack they began killing the captives while fleeing to dangerous waters. Father McDougall later wrote the following; [...] "So we took to our stations, loaded our guns, and prepared for action. The leading boat had already gained on the other two and was going nearly as fast as the steamer herself. I never saw fellows pull so. <b>We</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> all steam, cast off the Jolly, and tried to get in between her and the point, but she beat us, and passed inside of us into shallow water, where we could not follow. Then she opened her fire upon us, which we returned with interest. She, like the others, had no heavy guns, but they all carried three long brass swivels, called lelahs, and plenty of rifles and muskets." [...] The bishop went on to say that one of the captured pirates revealed to him that each of their swivels took seven men to lift and there was forty rifles and muskets aboard each boat, or more.|$|E
2500|$|On 5 February 2011 Booth {{retained}} his British {{title for}} the fourth time and retained his old Commonwealth title. His opponent, Jamie Arthur, had won the vacant belt beating Kris Hughes after Booth had given it up in order to fight for the World title. The fight, at the Brentwood Leisure Centre, resulted in a split decision win with both fighters suffering cuts during the fight. Speaking after the fight, Booth's manager Jimmy Gill said that the fight had only been arranged with three weeks' notice and said that Jason had only just come back from holiday and so had little time to prepare. Gill said, [...] "Jason is 34 in November and small guys like him don't normally last that long. They burn out". He added that he would never allow Booth to take a fight at such short notice again, saying, [...] "That was a favour to promoter Frank Maloney...It was a big ask but he pulled it off...But it was a one-off, I'll never do it again." [...] Of the fight, Booth paid tribute to Arthur, saying, [...] "That was the hardest fight I've had yet...I had to show heart because I was getting out-foxed by a clever champ. For saying we had three weeks' notice, <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> a good show." [...] Following the fight, it was confirmed that Booth would challenge Spain's Kiko Martínez for the European super bantamweight title, the fourth time Booth would have fought for a variation of the European belt. The fight against Martínez was eventually confirmed for Spain and took place on 15 April 2011 in front of a sell out 30,000 crowd in the city of Madrid. Martínez, a former two time European champion, won the fight in front of his home fans when in the tenth round a left hook was catalyst for the referee to call off the fight early, the first time Booth had been stopped in his career to date.|$|E
