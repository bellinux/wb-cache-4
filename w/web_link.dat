25|$|While the CRIME {{attack was}} {{presented}} as a general attack that could work effectively against {{a large number of}} protocols, including but not limited to TLS, and application-layer protocols such as SPDY or HTTP, only exploits against TLS and SPDY were demonstrated and largely mitigated in browsers and servers. The CRIME exploit against HTTP compression has not been mitigated at all, even though the authors of CRIME have warned that this vulnerability might be even more widespread than SPDY and TLS compression combined. In 2013 a new instance of the CRIME attack against HTTP compression, dubbed BREACH, was announced. Based on the CRIME attack a BREACH attack can extract login tokens, email addresses or other sensitive information from TLS encrypted web traffic in as little as 30 seconds (depending on the number of bytes to be extracted), provided the attacker tricks the victim into visiting a malicious <b>web</b> <b>link</b> or is able to inject content into valid pages the user is visiting (ex: a wireless network {{under the control of the}} attacker). All versions of TLS and SSL are at risk from BREACH regardless of the encryption algorithm or cipher used. Unlike previous instances of CRIME, which can be successfully defended against by turning off TLS compression or SPDY header compression, BREACH exploits HTTP compression which cannot realistically be turned off, as virtually all web servers rely upon it to improve data transmission speeds for users. This is a known limitation of TLS as it is susceptible to chosen-plaintext attack against the application-layer data it was meant to protect.|$|E

Document sharing services, such as those offered by Google and Dropbox, also work by sending a user a security token that's included in the URL. An attacker who obtains such URLs may be able to gain full access to a victim's account or data.|$|E

2500|$|On 18 July 2008, [...] "Girlfriend" [...] {{became the}} most viewed video at that time on YouTube and in August of that year, surpassed 100 million views, {{becoming}} the only YouTube video available {{at that time to}} reach that milestone (although CSS's [...] "Music Is My Hot Hot Sex" [...] had reached that milestone a couple months before, it has been removed from the website under accusations that the views had been frauded). The YouTube video of the song was accused of having an exaggerated number of views due to the use of a <b>web</b> <b>link</b> posted by AvrilBandAids, a fansite devoted to Lavigne. Clicking on the link would automatically reload the YouTube video of Girlfriend every fifteen seconds. Fans of Lavigne were encouraged to: [...] "Keep this page open while you browse the internet, study for exams, or even sleep. For extra viewing power, open up two or more browser windows at this page!" [...] However, the fansite later revealed that no [...] "cheating" [...] had taken place, and that the link had merely been a ruse to draw more attention to the video, thereby attracting additional views. It is expected that Lavigne's YouTube video views have earned in excess of US$2,000,000. In November 2009, RCA Records removed the video of the song from YouTube, by which time it had received around 130 million views. The video is now officially hosted on Vevo and Lavigne's Vevo channel on YouTube, surpassed 400 million views in September 2017.|$|E
