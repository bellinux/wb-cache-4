5|$|Built as a {{replacement}} for Forbes Field, which opened in 1909, the US$55million ($ million today) multi-purpose facility <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>maximize</b> efficiency. Ground was broken in April 1968 and an oft behind-schedule construction plan lasted for 29months. The stadium opened on July 16, 1970, when the Pirates played their first game there. In the 1971 World Series, Three Rivers Stadium hosted the first World Series game played at night. The following year, the stadium was the site of the Immaculate Reception. The final game in the stadium was won by the Steelers on December 16, 2000. Three Rivers Stadium also hosted the Pittsburgh Maulers of the United States Football League and the University of Pittsburgh Panthers football team for a single season each.|$|E
25|$|The State Corporation Commission (SCC) {{was formed}} {{as part of}} the 1902 Constitution, over the {{opposition}} of the railroads, to regulate railroad policies and rates.

25|$|Built before modern {{artificial}} ventilation, {{the building}} <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>maximize</b> air circulation: all offices {{not only had}} exterior windows, but also opened onto the court, {{which was designed to}} admit cool air at ground level and exhaust hot air at the roof. Made of brick and tile, the stairs were designed for the limitations of disabled and aging veterans, having a gradual ascent with low steps. In addition, each step slanted slightly from back to front to allow easy drainage: a flight could be washed easily by pouring water from the top.|$|E

25|$|What {{was unique}} about the Zisapels' {{business}} philosophy was that each company would operate independently, without a holding company, {{but all of}} the companies would be guided by them under a collective strategic umbrella. Companies may cooperate in the development of their solutions, engage in joint marketing activities and benefit from a common management structure. This decentralized business philosophy <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>maximize</b> the advantages inherent in smaller business units, such as flexibility, entrepreneurial spirit and management focus. As a result, since 1984, when the RAD Group came into being, it has spawned more than 185 companies, 8 IPOs and 19 mergers and acquisitions.|$|E

30|$|First, the {{algorithms}} <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>maximize</b> {{the total}} bit rate {{which is not}} directly related to users’ satisfaction, i.e., PSNR. Although the algorithms <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> avoid the worst cases that any user is not available of the BL as far as possible, the given resources still can be wasted. For example, {{a large part of the}} resources can be used to allocate the bit rates exceeding the maximum bit rates (required for transmitting all the video packets) to some of the users, while allocating only the minimum bit rates to others. Other than these algorithms, algorithms in[4 – 7] <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>maximize</b> average received PSNR for unicast services, and therefore such inefficient resource allocation can be avoided. Hence, such objectives need to be considered also for the multicast services in order to improve the PSNR performance.|$|R
