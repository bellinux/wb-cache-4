500|$|Del Rey {{stated the}} use of her lower vocals on the tracks {{claiming}} that [...] "people weren't taking me very seriously, so I lowered my voice, believing that it <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> stand out. Now I sing quite low... well, for a female anyway." [...] The singer's first singles, [...] "Video Games" [...] and [...] "Born to Die" [...] were described variously as [...] "quasi-cabaret balladry", [...] "woozy and sometimes soporific soundtrack soul", [...] "pop", and [...] "indie pop".|$|E
6000|$|... "Doctor Franck {{thought you}} <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> with this man, {{as there are}} many {{patients}} and few nurses or attendants. Have you had the fever?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{wish you}} <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> {{to get over}} that difficulty,' he said gently. 'Remember, I brought back a truant husband to you twenty years ago.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish I'd {{known that}} nice girl. Maybe she <b>would</b> have <b>helped</b> <b>me,</b> I'm so stupid," [...] said Beth, who stood beside him, {{listening}} eagerly.|$|R
6000|$|Arnold {{failed to}} see the wisdom {{embodied}} in that excellent advice. [...] "I thought you <b>would</b> have <b>helped</b> <b>me</b> to put things right with Blanche," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "And I {{would have}} done so, but my father <b>would</b> not <b>help</b> <b>me.</b> Never mind, we will not talk about him. How does Laura get on with her husband?" ...|$|R
60|$|Why not? Don't {{you know}} that I love you? It <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> so much if I knew that you were waiting for me at home.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{it would}} not {{inconvenience}} Miss Barrington, it <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> to understand a good deal I can find no meaning for now," [...] he said.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, no! Fly, don't say that. I don't {{really like}} her half so well, you know, {{only if you}} <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> to be kind to her.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I've sacrificed {{the best}} of my {{possessions}} and destroyed the confidence of folks who, to serve their ends, <b>would</b> have <b>helped</b> <b>me</b> on. Isn't that a serious thing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|And Pau Amma said, 'I do {{not choose}} yet, for, all soft as I am, these gifts <b>would</b> not <b>help</b> <b>me.</b> Give me back my shell, O Eldest Magician, and then I will play your play.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{only you}} <b>would</b> come to <b>help</b> <b>me!</b> Oh! Richard, {{if only you}} <b>would</b> come to <b>help</b> me," [...] the poor, {{worn-out}} girl murmured to herself, and so murmuring fell asleep.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is so," [...] Shillito agreed, smiling {{because he}} noted her relief. [...] "The trouble is, I haven't much money. Five hundred pounds <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> along." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What a pity! Couldn't {{you marry}} to oblige me? It <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> {{a great deal}} with the Dean and Chapter when I suggest {{rebuilding}} your house." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gold is {{generally}} useful, isn't it?" [...] smiled Dane. [...] "It <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> {{to earn a}} little more than my bread when I go back to England." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{do think}} so." [...] She was still {{standing}} and spoke now with great vehemence. [...] "I do think so. You force me to throw aside the reticence I ought to keep. <b>Would</b> it <b>help</b> <b>me</b> in my prospects if your friend Lord Silverbridge knew that I was here?" ...|$|R
60|$|Old Hasluck <b>would</b> have <b>helped</b> <b>me</b> willingly, {{and there}} were others to whom I might have appealed, but a boy's pride held me back. I would make my way alone, win my {{place in the world}} by myself. To Hal, knowing he would sympathise with me, I confided the truth.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I thought I was {{justified}} {{in making the}} promise after {{what you said about}} the pleasure it <b>would</b> be to <b>help</b> <b>me.</b> You remember, that day on the hilltop?' ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{spoke in}} a regretful tone so new to me that I {{inwardly}} repeated, as if that <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> to his meaning, [...] "That I could readily understand!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, sir, if you be not too holy {{to look at}} me {{or speak}} to me! If you <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> to some better knowledge--not only of sword and single-stick!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have an engagement, but I rather {{want the}} shares. My getting them <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> at the meeting," [...] he said. [...] "Shall we say twelve-and-sixpence? This is the limit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing," [...] replied Blakeney. [...] "He refused all bribes, and {{violence}} <b>would</b> not have <b>helped</b> <b>me,</b> for what I wanted {{was not to}} knock him down, but {{to get hold of}} the letters." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose," [...] {{she went}} on, a little drearily, [...] "that even if I told you upon my honour, of my certain knowledge, that the due {{delivery}} of that packet might {{save the lives}} of thousands of your countrymen, might save hearts from breaking, homes from becoming destitute--even if I told you all this, <b>would</b> it <b>help</b> <b>me</b> in my prayer?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{know that}} if you <b>would</b> have <b>helped</b> <b>me</b> I <b>would</b> have done it in spite of papa. What right has he to domineer over me in that way? Why shouldn't I have married the man if I chose? I am old enough to know surely. You talk now of {{shutting}} up girls in convents as being a thing quite impossible. This is much worse. Papa won't do anything to <b>help</b> <b>me.</b> Why shouldn't he let me do something for myself?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We talked--some time ago," [...] he went on, [...] "about my getting away. You {{promised that}} you <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>me.</b> You said that I could {{get off to}} Africa or America to-morrow." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{thought that}} {{if one of them}} <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> with the sea-feather, which seemed awfully heavy, two of us could {{certainly}} swim to the boat with four legs and two arms between us.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh no," [...] {{said the}} artist; [...] "it's a studio. The light's all wrong. I {{wonder if you}} would mind {{standing}} just as you are for one second; it <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> a lot!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And now I see,' said Gillian, 'that it {{all came}} of a nasty sort of {{antagonism}} to Aunt Jane. I never guessed how like I was to Dolores, and I thought her so bad. But if I had only trusted Aunt Jane, and had no secrets, she <b>would</b> have <b>helped</b> <b>me</b> in it all, I know now, and never have brought the Whites into trouble.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I MUST learn it! Do {{come and}} give me lessons at our house. I called for Maud and must go now. Will you come, Jessie? I'll be glad to pay you if you don't mind. I hate to be laughed at; and I know if some one <b>would</b> just <b>help</b> <b>me</b> alone I should {{do as well as}} the rest, for Professor Ludwig raves at us all." ...|$|R
60|$|At {{the best}} she was blinded, and where she lay in her {{darkness}} no man might come because of the superstitions of these folk. Even if Kari became Inca, it <b>would</b> not <b>help</b> <b>me</b> or her, should she still live, since he was the fiercest bigot of them all and swore that he would kill me, his friend, rather than that I should touch her, the vowed to his false gods.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, Stephen, {{you are a}} {{good old}} sort! No mistake about it. Do you mean to say you <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> to pay my debts, when the {{governor}} has refused to do so any more?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Could you do that, sir? If {{you could}} it <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> out a whole lot. My brother has {{a wife and}} two little children, and she'll be scared to death if Bill is injured." ...|$|E
60|$|Before I retired for {{the night}} he promised {{to give me a}} letter to a nearby {{agricultural}} officer who <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> on my way to Zodanga, which he said, was the nearest Martian city.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come now, my boy, you mustn't {{give way}} to that. It is death, you know. Hold up! Be a man! Act as Lumley would have acted in similar circumstances. Dear Lumley! How he <b>would</b> run to <b>help</b> <b>me</b> if he only knew!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{tell you}} you are not {{interested}}. You would only be interested through <b>me.</b> That <b>would</b> not <b>help</b> <b>me.</b> I should just be dealing out my premature ideas to you. If you cared as I care, {{if you wanted to}} know as I want to know, it would be different. But you don't. It isn't your fault that you don't. It happens so. And there is no good in forced interest, in prescribed discovery." ...|$|R
6000|$|JACK. [Turning {{upon his}} sire, with {{unexpected}} fierceness.] All right, I won't then, {{and see how}} you like it. You <b>would</b> n't have <b>helped</b> <b>me</b> this time, I know, {{if you had n't}} been scared the thing would get into the papers. Where are the cigarettes? ...|$|R
