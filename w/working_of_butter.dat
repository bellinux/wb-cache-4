40|$|The {{bacteria}} in butter are largely {{contained in the}} moisture droplets. Since water is not the continuous phase, as in milk and cream, migration does not take place readily, and growth is restricted primarily to infected droplets. As pointed out by various investigators, the <b>working</b> <b>of</b> <b>butter</b> disperses the moisture into finer droplets. In under worked butter the droplets are relatively large while in thoroughly worked butter they are smaller and well separated by fat. The number of {{bacteria in}} a portion of butter remains practically constant during working, consequently {{an increase in the}} number of water droplets through a finer dispersion of the moisture results in a decrease in the percentage of infected droplets. Decreasing the size of the droplets also decreases the nutrients available to the bacteria in the infected droplets. Accordingly, the distribution of moisture in butter is a factor tending to influence the growth of bacteria, and changes due to bacterial action should take place more slowly in thoroughly worked than in under worked butter...|$|E
40|$|Statistical {{estimation}} of the demand function for most industrial, and many agricultural, products is inhibited by price fixing or price stabilizing arrangements which prevent observation of {{the full range of}} possible price-quantity combinations. In the period 1956 to 1961 the London butter market has illustrated how markedly price can fluctuate, when not subject to a stablizing agreement. In the period 1958 to 1961 estimates of retail sales <b>of</b> <b>butter</b> are available, and these permit the {{estimation of}} the demand for butter at retail. The time lag between production and consumption decisions means that there is no problem of identification. The present study uses weekly price and quantity information, and there is a serious problem of auto-correlation of the observations. The interesting story of the development <b>of</b> the London <b>butter</b> market in Tooley Street has been ignored. Rather, this study provides a brief description <b>of</b> the current <b>working</b> <b>of</b> the <b>butter</b> market, together with new estimates for the demand function for butter in the United Kingdom. Previous estimates of the United Kingdom price elasticity <b>of</b> demand for <b>butter</b> have been published by Brown as -. 6, in 1954 - 58, by Stone as -. 37 in 1921 - 38 and anonymously in Economic Trends as -. 34.

The effect of HS on micro-and nanostructure of developed types <b>of</b> <b>butter</b> was studied. It was established that the introduction of HS reduces the value of nanostructure's elements <b>of</b> <b>butter</b> in a 5 - 25 times. The nature and properties of HS influence the formation <b>of</b> the <b>butter's</b> nanostructure, the architecture and morphology of its nanoelements. According to comprehensive studies {{it was found that the}} decreasing of the size <b>of</b> <b>butter's</b> nanostructure's elements improves the structure, texture and rheological parameters <b>of</b> <b>butter</b> - it increases the thermal stability and plasticity, the ability of the structure to retain the liquid phase of fat and a structure's connection, prevents the formation of layered and brittle consistency <b>of</b> <b>butter,</b> promotes the formation of coagulation-crystallization structure dominated by coagulation, inhibits microbiological and biochemical spoilage <b>of</b> <b>butter.</b> According to the results of clinical trials and the conclusions of the Ministry of Health developed the kinds <b>of</b> <b>butter</b> are recommended to use in health care and dietary nutrition.

40|$|Over {{the years}} the demand for butter in Canada has {{decreased}} resulting in a surplus <b>of</b> <b>butter.</b> In 1965 the per capita consumption <b>of</b> <b>butter</b> in Canada was 8. 23 Kg which decreased by about 70 % to 2. 66 Kg in 1994. Previous research indicates that consumers are switching from butter to margarine due to concerns about heart disease and high cholesterol levels in butter. Therefore, a market {{study was conducted in}} Montreal to estimate the potential demand for a new product called "modified" butter which would create 50 % less cholesterol in the body than regular butter. When the concept <b>of</b> "modified" <b>butter</b> was introduced, out of 157 respondents about 80 % {{of the respondents indicated that}} they would buy "modified" butter. Also, the total quantity of margarine demanded in a month decreased by 47 % and the regular butter demand decreased by 85 %. The market share <b>of</b> "modified" <b>butter</b> comes to about 67 %. The average of the price that the consumers are willing to pay for a kilogram <b>of</b> "modified" <b>butter</b> is $ 7. 50. A detailed cost analysis shows that the production cost <b>of</b> ``modified'' <b>butter</b> at the experimental level is high, but the average costs show a decreasing trend when the scale of production is increased. If the economies of scale were to continue along the derived cost curves, 7 tons <b>of</b> "modified" <b>butter</b> would have to be produced to reach the break-even point of $ 7. 50 /Kg cost of production. This shows the industrial potential of producing large quantities <b>of</b> ``modified'' <b>butter</b> by taking advantage of the economies of scale. Furthermore, the overall sales <b>of</b> <b>butter</b> (regular butter plus ``modified'' butter) would increase by about 25 % which would boost the consumption <b>of</b> <b>butter</b> in Canada...|$|R
