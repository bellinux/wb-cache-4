5|$|After World War II many Polish sport clubs resumed slowly their activity. After the {{communist}} takeover {{of power in}} Czechoslovakia in February 1948 communists began to curb number of organizations {{in the country and}} tried to achieve the state of only several active nationwide organizations. Therefore, many Polish clubs after 1948 stopped their activity. The ones who still operated <b>were</b> <b>subjected</b> to rising pressure since 1951. Last independent Polish organizations were dissolved in 1952.|$|E
5|$|After the Muslim {{conquest of}} Persia, Zoroastrians were given dhimmi status and {{subjected}} to persecutions; discrimination and harassment began {{in the form of}} sparse violence.

Zoroastrians who were captured as slaves in wars were given their freedom if they converted to Islam.|$|E
5|$|All {{but four}} of the women from Lidice were {{deported}} immediately to Ravensbrück concentration camp (four were pregnant– they <b>were</b> <b>subjected</b> to forced abortions at the same hospital where Heydrich had died and the women were then sent to the concentration camp). Some children were chosen for Germanization, and 81 were killed in gas vans at the Chełmno extermination camp. Both towns were burned and Lidice's ruins were levelled. At least 1,300 people were massacred after Heydrich's death.|$|E

5|$|All {{publications}} and media <b>were</b> <b>subjected</b> to censorship. The Soviets sought to recruit Polish left-wing intellectuals {{who were willing}} to cooperate. Soon after the Soviet invasion, the Writers' Association of Soviet Ukraine created a local chapter in Lwów; there was a Polish-language theater and radio station. Polish cultural activities in Minsk and Wilno were less organized. These activities were strictly controlled by the Soviet authorities, which saw to it that these activities portrayed the new Soviet regime in a positive light and vilified the former Polish government.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, the 12th Devons {{had arrived in}} the divisional area from the landing beaches and were ordered to take over the defence of the Bas de Ranville from the 12th Parachute Battalion.

The area remained under Carib control until the Second Carib War of 1795.|$|E

Racial laws were introduced, Jewish property was confiscated, and the Jews <b>were</b> <b>subjected</b> to mass arrests and deportations to death camps in Croatia and abroad.|$|E

Following intense criticism in the press—especially the black press, because of the high percentage of African Americans who received blue discharges—and in Congress, the blue discharge was discontinued in 1947, replaced by two new classifications: general and undesirable.|$|E
