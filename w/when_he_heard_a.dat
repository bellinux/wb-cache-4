During his studies he took a study tour to Austria-Hungary and found a new method of producing yeast, which fascinated him. Later, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> baker in Delft complain about the varying quality and poor availability of yeast in the Netherlands, he recalled the method which he learnt during his tour, and decided to produce industrial baker's yeast of consistently high quality.|$|E
5|$|Horses appear {{frequently}} in accounts concerning miraculous {{events in the}} context of Anglo-Saxon Christianity. In the 7th century, a horse is reported to have revealed warm bread and some meat when St Cuthbert was hungry, by pulling straw from the roof of a hut; and, when Cuthbert was suffering from a diseased knee, he was visited by an angel on horseback, who helped him to heal his knee. In the 8th century, the Anglo-Saxon Bishop Willibald of Eichstätt wrote that, when a source of fresh water was needed for a monastery on the site where St Boniface had died, in the kingdom of Frisia, the ground gave way under the forelegs of a horse, and, when the horse was pulled free, a fountain of spring water came out of the ground and formed a brook. In the 10th century, King Edmund I is reported to have been saved from death while chasing a deer on horseback when he prayed for forgiveness for his maltreatment of St Dunstan, and thereafter made him abbot of Glastonbury: the horse stopped {{at the edge of a}} cliff, over which the deer and hunting dogs had already fallen. On a later occasion, a horse fell dead under Dunstan <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> voice from heaven telling him that King Eadred had died.|$|E

25|$|Kenny G {{was born}} in Seattle, Washington. His mother was {{originally}} from Saskatchewan, Canada. His family was Jewish, and {{he grew up in}} Seattle's Seward Park neighborhood, which is a center of the city's Jewish community.

25|$|Corrigan {{had just}} stepped {{out the front}} door <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> second shot behind him. He turned and saw Switzer sliding down the wall with a {{surprised}} look on his face. Stiltz had shot him. Corrigan said he saw a closed penknife at Switzer's side, which he presumed fell out of his pocket or his hand. He then saw his stepfather shove Piott against the kitchen counter and threaten to kill him too. As Piott begged for his life, they heard emergency sirens. Corrigan thought this was the only reason Stiltz did not kill Piott. Corrigan said his stepfather lied in his account of the event before the coroner's jury.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} idea {{was created by}} Noé Santillán-López <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>an</b> old recording of the poem [...] "Por Qué Me Quité del Vicio" [...] written by Carlos Rivas Larráuri, in 2006, and began developing a story based on it. Classmate and producer Cayman Eby collaborated with López to shoot the short on location in Guadalajara, México. This became the first narrative short in SCAD to be shot outside of the continental U.S.A.|$|R
60|$|Morris {{was amazed}} at all this. He could not persuade himself that he had rightly {{understood}} what had been said. There was something beneath the man's words which puzzled him and forbade his inquiry. He sat down near the oldest child and opposite Mrs. Miner. Miner began to eat, and Morris was speaking pleasantly to the child nearest him, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>an</b> oath and a slap.

25|$|The next part in Guth's path came <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> lecture by Steven Weinberg {{in early}} 1979. Weinberg talked in two lectures about the Grand Unified Theory (GUT) {{that had been}} {{developed}} since 1974, and how it could explain the huge amount of matter in the universe compared {{to the amount of}} antimatter. The GUT explained all the fundamental forces known in science except for gravity. It established that in very hot conditions, such as those after the Big Bang, electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force, and the weak nuclear force were united to form one force. Weinberg also was the one who emphasized the idea that the universe goes through phase transitions, similar to the phases of matter, when going from high energy to low energy. Weinberg’s discussion of why matter is so dominant over anti-matter showed Guth how precise calculations about particles could be obtained by studying the first few seconds of the universe.|$|E
25|$|All guests retire for bed except Lord Charles and Sir George. Mr. Carlile {{is sent to}} get {{the plans}} for the fighter from the safe, so he set off for the study, colliding with Mrs. Vanderlyn who wants to {{retrieve}} her handbag. The two men walk along the terrace, when Lord Charles is startled by a figure leaving the study by the French window, although Sir George sees nothing. When they enter the study, Mr. Carlile has the papers out but Lord Charles quickly sees that the plans of the fighter itself are gone. Carlile is adamant that they were in the safe and he put them on the table. He was distracted <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> woman's scream in the hallway and ran out to find Leonie, Mrs. Vanderlyn's maid, who claimed that she had seen a ghost. Carlile had not otherwise left the study. Sir George suggests calling in Hercule Poirot immediately.|$|E
500|$|A {{mandatory}} three-day mini-camp {{was held}} in early May. Hines Ward, Aaron Smith and Troy Polamalu attended the camp, but did not fully participate because of injuries. First round draft pick, Rashard Mendenhall was welcomed by Steelers current running back Willie Parker. Parker was [...] "surprised" [...] <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> running back was selected in the first round, but hoped to work with Mendenhall like Jerome Bettis worked with Parker during his rookie season. During the mini-camp, the offense experimented with formations using Parker and Mendenhall in the backfield simultaneously. Receiver Hines Ward took a similar approach to Parker's in welcoming second round draft pick Limas Sweed. As with other receivers in the past, Ward was [...] "very hands-on with Sweed throughout the weekend". Coach Mike Tomlin called the new draft picks [...] "humble", adding that he liked their [...] "spirit and attitude"; however, {{it was too early}} to tell how well they will ultimately perform.|$|E

500|$|Gagnon's {{fascination with}} Peru and the Asháninka [...] began after World War II, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> bishop give a talk about them. He then worked {{for three years}} in a shoe factory and {{restaurant}} in New Hampshire to save money to allow him to visit Lima. In 1948, he came to Peru, entered the Franciscan order, and took the name Mariano. Gagnon was ordained a priest in 1957, and spent three years working with those who spoke Cocama, an indigenous language of Peru. He said of the people that he served, [...] "They are the most virtuous people I have ever met. They never lie and have great respect for personal property. Their language is very sharp. There is no word for 'maybe' in Campa." [...] He also observed that they did not chew coca leaves and were not prone to sharing food and drink, which had been a major cause of rampant tuberculosis. There was also a high infant mortality rate. By 1969, he had established two missions and began work on a third.|$|E
500|$|In 1969, King again {{tried and}} failed to {{circumnavigate}} in Galway Blazer II. In 1970, he was ready for another attempt, again using Galway Blazer II. Ill-health and hull damage forced him to put ashore at Australia. After departing on 12 December 1971, a large sea creature (a whale or shark) damaged his boat about [...] southwest of Fremantle. [...] "Only his skill and heroic efforts were able to keep the vessel afloat until jury repairs could be made". King was below deck <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> shattering sound and saw the hull below the water line bulge inward and splinter. He rushed upstairs and heeled the boat so that the hole was lifted out of the water. He had to hang over the side and submerge himself to carry out emergency repairs with material that included thirteen ropes, sticky tape, collision covers, sheet copper, and sponge rubber. Then he had to fix the inside of the hull as well. After three days of work, he was able to return to Fremantle, [...] "barely able to limp into port".|$|E
500|$|The {{comic book}} series was {{announced}} at the 2009 Comic-Con International, and was scheduled to debut in October 2009, but its launch was delayed to coincide with that of God of War III. Scott A. Steinberg, Vice President of Product Marketing at SCEA said, [...] "we are thrilled {{to work with the}} world's largest comic book publisher to bring one of our most beloved PlayStation franchises...to comic book fans." [...] In an interview with IGN, the series writer Marv Wolfman stated that <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> rumor of the series, he [...] "put [...] name right away and kept pushing" [...] to be chosen as the writer because God of War is one of his favorite video games. Wolfman said that he had already played the first two games, so there was no research to be done and [...] "it's because [...] loved the game that [...] wanted to do the comic." [...] He received copies of the scripts for all the games to ensure his work was as accurate as possible, and stated that he worked very closely with Sony Santa Monica—the developer of the video games—and tied the comic book's narrative directly to the story they created for the games. Wolfman said that Santa Monica ensured the mythology was consistent while revealing new facts about Kratos' past.|$|E
60|$|The launch quivered {{and leaped}} {{ahead with the}} foam curling at her bows, and Dick did not look round <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>an</b> expostulating shout. Jake and Bethune must get ashore as they could; his errand was too {{important}} to stop for them, particularly as {{he could no longer}} see the boat in front. She had crossed the glittering belt of moonlight and vanished into the shadow near the mole. Her occupant had had some minutes' start and had probably landed, but {{it might be possible to}} find out where he had gone.|$|R

2500|$|Lieutenant Wilson later {{testified at}} his court martial {{proceedings}} that he first {{realized that the}} two aircraft had collided <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> [...] "noise and a wrenching of my ship up... to my left." [...] He also testified that he noticed that his aircraft handled sluggishly and the right engine felt [...] "rough." [...] He was informed by his copilot that they had hit the airliner. The B-34 called the Palm Springs tower to notify them of the accident and then subsequently landed at Palm Springs Army Airport.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Howard Brennan, a steamfitter who {{was sitting}} {{across the street from}} the Texas School Book Depository, {{notified}} police that he was watching the motorcade go by <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> shot that came from above and looked up to see a man with a rifle take another shot from a corner window on the sixth floor. He said he had seen the same man minutes earlier looking out the window. Brennan gave a description of the shooter, and Dallas police subsequently broadcast descriptions at 12:45p.m., 12:48p.m., and 12:55p.m. After the second shot was fired, Brennan recalled, [...] "This man I saw previous was aiming for his last shot... and maybe paused for another second as though to assure himself that he had hit his mark." ...|$|E
50|$|The 'Thottiyars' clan {{of people}} lived at Karamadai. A cow {{of one of}} the thottiyars failed to yield milk all of a sudden. He found out that the cow was {{shedding}} milk at a bush.

On hearing this, the other people in the village came there and found a 'Suyambu Lingam' inside the bush. The same night, God appeared in his dream and asked him to adorn the 'Lingam' with 'Chandana Kaapu'. It is believed that the lingam 'Ranganathar Suyambu' is growing in size every year.|$|R

5000|$|According {{to police}} reports, after {{listening}} to audio recordings of the 9-1-1 calls, Martin's father, Tracy Martin, told police investigators {{that it was not}} Trayvon Martin's voice yelling for help. Martin has since told reporters he was uncertain at that time, but that <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>an</b> enhanced recording on March 16 he was convinced it was his son yelling for help. Investigators interviewed Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton, who reviewed the 9-1-1 calls to police and identified the voice crying for help as her son. Investigators also interviewed Martin's cousin who stated that without a doubt [...] "on a stack of bibles" [...] it was Martin yelling for help on the 9-1-1 tape.|$|R
2500|$|The captain {{used the}} navigational method of dead {{reckoning}} to estimate his position <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> whistle {{of an approaching}} pilot boat. The pilot came aboard to guide the Letitia through the fog, between the unseen buoys and into the harbour. The pilot continued the course, but he hadn't realized that the captain had incorrectly estimated the ship's position. Ten minutes after the pilot boarded the ship, the captain saw a dark object coming closer and ordered the ship full astern. The order however, came too late and the Letitia was forcefully stopped when she ran aground on Portuguese Cove in Halifax Harbour. Captain McNeil tried to reverse the engines in order to free the ship from her stricken position, but the holds were perforated and the ship {{was in danger of}} breaking up, sliding off the shoal and sinking beneath the waves with all of the wounded men still onboard.|$|E
2500|$|Robbie Robertson of the Band {{described}} Lightfoot as [...] "a national treasure". Bob Dylan, also a Lightfoot fan, {{called him}} {{one of his favorite}} songwriters and, in an often-quoted tribute, Dylan observed that <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> Lightfoot song he wished [...] "it would last forever". Lightfoot was a featured musical performer at the opening ceremonies of the 1988 Winter Olympic Games in Calgary, Alberta. He received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree (arts) in 1979 and the Companion of the Order of Canada—Canada's highest civilian honour—in 2003. In November 1997, Lightfoot was awarded the Governor General's Performing Arts Award, Canada's highest honour in the performing arts. On February 6, 2012, Lightfoot was presented with the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal by the Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario. In June that year he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. On June 6, 2015, Lightfoot received an honorary doctorate of music in his hometown of Orillia from Lakehead University.|$|E
2500|$|The British {{left their}} camp at Burlington Heights at 11:30p.m. on 5 June. [...] While Vincent was the senior officer present, {{the troops were}} placed under the conduct and {{direction}} of Lieutenant Colonel Harvey, who led them silently toward Stoney Creek. They had removed the flints from their muskets {{to ensure that there}} were no accidental discharges and dared not utter even a whisper. [...] A sentry post of American soldiers was surprised and either captured or killed by bayonet. Billy Green is said to have bayoneted one of the American sentries personally, although this is not mentioned in any official British record. [...] The British continued advancing toward the American campfires in silence. However at the repeated urging of Second Lieutenant Ephraim Shaler, the U.S. 25th Regiment which had earlier been camped there had been moved from their previous exposed position, leaving behind only the cooks who were preparing the troops' meal for the next day. Shaler had returned to the original position <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> sentry cry out as he was being tomahawked after being shot with an arrow from one of John Norton's small band of First Nations warriors.|$|E
