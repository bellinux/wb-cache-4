40|$|Additive Schwarz preconditioners are {{developed}} for the h-version of the boundary element method for the hypersingular integral equa-tion on surfaces in three dimensions. The first preconditioner consists of decomposing into local spaces associated with the subdomain inte-riors, supplemented with a <b>wirebasket</b> space associated with the the subdomain interfaces. The <b>wirebasket</b> correction only involves the inversion of a diagonal matrix, while the interior correction consists of inverting the sub-blocks of the stiffness matrix corresponding to the interior degrees of freedom on each subdomain. It is shown that the condition number of the preconditioned system grows at most as H− 1 (1 + logH/h) 2 where H {{is the size of}} the subdomains and h is the size of the elements. A second preconditioner is given that incor-porates a coarse space associated with the subdomains. This improves the robustness of the method with respect to the number of subdo-mains: theoretical analysis shows that growth of the condition number of the preconditioned system is now bounded by (1 + logH/h) 2...|$|E
40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of Additive Schwarz preconditioners for the h-version of the boundary element method for the hypersingular integral equation on surfaces in three dimensions.

40|$|International audiencePHIDAL (parallel {{hierarchical}} interface decomposition algorithm) is {{a parallel}} incomplete factorization method which exploits a hierarchical interface decomposition of the adjacency graph of the coefficient matrix. The {{idea of the}} decomposition {{is similar to that}} of the well-known <b>wirebasket</b> techniques used in domain decomposition. However, the method is devised for general, irregularly structured, sparse linear systems. This paper describes a few algorithms for obtaining good quality hierarchical graph decompositions and discusses the parallel implementation of the factorization procedure. Numerical experiments are reported to illustrate the scalability of the algorithm and its effectiveness as a general purpose parallel linear system solver...|$|E
40|$|Schwarz Method We {{consider}} linear systems, Ax = f, where A {{arises from}} the discretization of a partial differential operator. The prototype solution algorithm, the additive Schwarz method, can be written as B = X j R j B j R j (2. 1) with approximate solvers B j operating on a subspace V j and restrictions R j and adjoint interpolations R j. In particular we consider the following methods and its variants (see also [SBG 96]), which all can be written in the framework: multilevel iteration additive, multiplicative, nonlinear overlapping Schwarz additive, multiplicative, nonlinear with, without coarse grid Schur complement iteration exact, inexact local solves Schur complement preconditioner Neumann-Neumann, <b>wirebasket</b> with, without coarse grid The interface basically consists of ffl transfer or restriction operators such as R j and R j, ffl (approximate) subspace solvers B j, ffl evaluation of residuals (f Γ A j x) on a subdomain (optional) ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis extends earlier {{research}} {{in numerical analysis}} and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to obtain a novel finite element method for the transient, 3 -D, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, along with efficient, parallelizable algorithms to carry out an implementation of the method in such a fashion as to be useful in mainstream industrial settings. ^ This new finite element procedure employs alternating-direction operator splittings to model problems of increasing complexity in a step-by-step and natural manner. The scheme employs a characteristic-Galerkin method for the numerical treatment of the nonlinear advection operator. Non-overlapping domain decomposition schemes are employed for the solution of linear Stokes-type subproblems and for the matching of the inviscid and viscous solutions in different subdomains. These problems are solved by Bramble-Pasciak-Schatz <b>wirebasket</b> domain decomposition methods in a stabilized mixed finite element method formulation. The scheme is coupled to an existing grid generator code that provides globally unstructured, but locally structured grids, within each subdomain. Numerical results obtained include incompressible viscous flows over a backward facing steps at various Reynolds numbers and show very good to excellent agreement with experiments {{as well as other}} published numerical results. ...|$|E
