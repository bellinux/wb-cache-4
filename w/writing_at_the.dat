5|$|After leaving school, Smith studied {{drama and}} {{creative}} <b>writing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of East Anglia, graduating in 2005. His first theatre roles {{as part of}} the National Youth Theatre were Thomas Becket in Murder in the Cathedral and Bassoon in The Master and Margarita. His role in the latter earned him an agent and his first professional jobs, Fresh Kills and On the Shore of the Wide World. His new professional roles led him to seek an agreement with his university so that he could graduate without attending lectures in his final year.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of his <b>writing,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time of his death Wallace had been for many years a {{well-known}} figure both as a scientist and as a social activist. He was often sought out by journalists and others for his views on a variety of topics. He received honorary doctorates and a number of professional honours, such the Royal Society's Royal Medal and Darwin Medal in 1868 and 1890 respectively, and the Order of Merit in 1908. Above all, his role as the co-discoverer of natural selection and his work on zoogeography marked him out as an exceptional figure.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{continuing}} popularity of Jerome's Chronicon and Orosius' Historia, the medieval writers who wrote about Philip called him the first Christian emperor. The Chronica Gallica of 452, Prosper of Aquitaine (d. ca. 455), Cassiodorus (d. ca. 585), Jordanes (fl. 551), Isidore of Seville (d. 636), and Bede (d. 735) all follow Jerome on this point. One early medieval historian <b>writing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> eve of the millennium, the Lombard Landolfus Sagax, held that Philip had confessed to Fabian, Bishop of Rome, instead of Babylas.|$|E

5|$|Anderson {{initially}} {{intended it}} to be a stand-alone short film, but shortly before filming commenced, he realized that Schwartzman's character bore a close resemblance to one of the protagonists of a feature film he was <b>writing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time. That film would begin production a year later as The Darjeeling Limited. Chevalier takes place two weeks before Schwartzman's character (named Jack Whitman in the feature) joins his two older brothers on a journey in India in Darjeeling. The dialogue between the characters at the end of Chevalier is recounted by Schwartzman's character to his brothers {{at the close of the}} feature film, in the form of an excerpt from a short story he has composed. Portman's character has a brief cameo in the feature. Fox Searchlight Pictures, the studio that backed Darjeeling, was unaware of the short until the feature had been made and claimed to have no financial interest in it.|$|E

5|$|<b>Writing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{end of the}} 19th century, the Brazilian {{abolitionist}} leader Joaquim Nabuco {{said that}} Rio Branco was—of all the politicians who held the office during PedroII's reign—the most fitted to the post of President of the Council of Ministers. Nabuco considered {{him one of the}} greatest statesmen of the Empire. However, he also argued that as a leader, a lawmaker, and a creator of doctrines, there were many other politicians far better than Rio Branco. But unlike all the others, who were brilliantly accomplished in one or a few skills, but lacking in many others, Rio Branco was good—though unexceptional—in all. In other words, he was a competent generalist. Nabuco's view was that due to Rio Branco's lack of first-rate abilities, he would not have been the best leader in troubled times—such as the anarchy which existed during PedroII's minority, or {{at the end of a}} period of chaos when strong action was needed to rebuild. Rio Branco was, however, the perfect choice in a time of peace and stability where his multiple skills could shine. His ability exactly fit the situation in Brazil when he became President of the Council of Ministers in 1871.|$|E
