5|$|A {{group of}} thieves stole, {{on a summer}} day, horses {{that belonged to the}} Monastery of StJovan Vladimir. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> the nearby stream of Kusha to take the horses across, it {{appeared}} to them like an enormous river. They moved away from it in fear, but when they looked back from a distance, the stream appeared small. As they approached it again, the Kusha again became huge and impassable. After several such attempts to cross the stream, the thieves realized that this was a miracle of the saint, so they released the monastery's horses and ran away in horror.|$|E
5|$|Another origin tale {{claims that}} King Solomon {{was given a}} pure Arabian-type mare named Safanad ("the pure") by the Queen of Sheba. A {{different}} version says that Solomon gave a stallion, Zad el-Raheb or Zad-el-Rakib ("Gift to the Rider"), to the Banu Azd people <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> {{pay tribute to the}} king. This legendary stallion was said to be faster than the zebra and the gazelle, and every hunt with him was successful, thus when he was put to stud, he became a founding sire of legend.|$|E
5|$|I {{remember}} <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> record 'Spice Up Your Life'. It was in {{the middle}} of the chaos. It had been booked in, that they were coming in to record their next single, and write it, with us. It was at Whitfield Street Studios and there was going to be an MTV crew there filming them as they did this, which there was. Well, how on earth can you possibly do this? You can't write and record a song in half-an-hour with a film crew watching.|$|E

5|$|In 1931, he was {{transferred}} to Fort Myer in Virginia. While stationed there, Matthews {{and some of his}} troops were escorts for King George VI and his wife Queen Elizabeth <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> visit President Franklin D. Roosevelt at the White House. He earned acclaim for his horse shows, which helped sell war bonds during World War II and he tended to First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt's personal horses. He also played on the polo team while stationed in the state.|$|E
5|$|Sir Nicholas' kindertransport efforts {{remained}} largely unrecognised until 1988, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> public attention {{after his wife}} found a scrapbook in their attic documenting the details. Only then did the individuals whom Winton arranged to have transported to safety as children learn {{the story of how}} they survived the Holocaust. As the majority of 'Winton's Children' (as they came to be known) were Jewish, it is believed this saved them from certain death had they stayed in Czechoslovakia. As of 2009, the direct descendants of Winton's Children numbered over 5000 people.|$|E
5|$|The English Great Horse was valued {{during the}} reign of Henry VIII, when stallions {{measuring}} less than 'fifteen handfuls' could not be kept, but the increasing role of gunpowder brought an end to the use of heavy horses in battle. Oliver Cromwell's cavalry favoured lighter, faster mounts and the big horses began to be used for draught work instead. During the 16th century, Dutch engineers brought Friesian horses with them <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> England to drain the fens, and these horses probably had a significant influence on what became the Shire breed.|$|E

5|$|On {{the south}} {{eastern side of}} the house is an orangery, which was built as a {{greenhouse}} in 1701 and has a glazed roof which was added around 1800 by Humphrey Repton. The orangery hides the view of the servants' quarters from the main house. The servants' quarters was revised and modernised in the 1840s. It contains the kitchen, dairy, bakehouse and several larders for raw and cooked meat. There is also a servants' hall where the staff would take their meals and a tenants' hall which was used by the tenant farmers to eat on the days <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> pay their rent. In addition to the designs for the house, William Talman created the large 15-bay stable block. It is now used as a tea-room for visitors.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, {{six days}} {{before the start of}} the 1947 season, the Dodgers called Robinson up to the major leagues. With Eddie Stanky entrenched at second base for the Dodgers, Robinson played his initial major league season as a first baseman. On April 15, 1947, Robinson made his major league debut at the relatively advanced age of 28 at Ebbets Field before a crowd of 26,623 spectators, more than 14,000 of whom were black. Although he failed to get a base hit, he walked and scored a run in the Dodgers' 5–3 victory. Robinson became the first player since 1880 to openly break the major league baseball color line. Black fans began flocking to see the Dodgers <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> town, abandoning their Negro league teams.|$|E

25|$|The {{cemetery}} was fenced by the 1860s, {{according to}} one account to keep Texas longhorn cattle out. In 1868 one Doswell donated some land and in the 1870s a new fence was constructed. Family plots were fenced by those who could afford to do so. Each family took care of its own area, showing up for all day meetings and dinner <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> clear weeds and do any needed restoration.|$|E
25|$|In 1836, Caroline {{left her}} husband. Caroline managed to subsist on her {{earnings}} as an author, but Norton claimed these as his own, arguing successfully in court that, as her husband, Caroline's earnings were legally his. Paid nothing by her husband, her earnings confiscated, Caroline used {{the law to}} her own advantage. Running up bills in her husband's name, Caroline told the creditors <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> collect, that if they wished to be paid, they could sue her husband.|$|E
25|$|At the zoo, Bobo {{became a}} big tourist attraction. The zoo {{was able to}} use the {{publicity}} surrounding Bobo to garner public support for a new primate house. While at the zoo, Bobo never forgot about the Lowmans, instantly recognizing any of them <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> visit. In 1956, the zoo introduced a female gorilla named Fifi to Bobo's cage in the hopes that they would mate. Although Fifi remained with Bobo until his death, they never mated, which perplexed zookeepers and the media who followed them.|$|E

The ultimately agreed purchase price was paid by Abu Ayyub al-Ansari who thus became the واقِف (waqif, or creator of an endowment or mortmain; donor) of Al-Masjid an-Nabawi on behalf of, or in favor of Muhammad.|$|E
25|$|All {{the while}} the hostages {{were kept in}} the {{polishing}} plant.

On the advice of Amichai Paglin, the Irgun's Chief of Operations, who arrived from Tel Aviv {{on the day of}} the kidnapping, a decoy was arranged: a pickup truck was loaded with kidnapping equipment and sent to Herzliya, where it was left at the beach, leaving clear traces. Paglin also arranged for oxygen tanks to be brought to the bunker, before returning to Tel Aviv.|$|E
25|$|David {{gathered}} {{together all the}} chosen men of Israel — 30,000 in all — and went to retrieve the Ark of the Covenant from Baale-judah. They brought the Ark {{out of the house}} of Abinadab and set it on a new cart. Abinadab's sons Uzzah and Ahio drove the cart, with Ahio going before the Ark. David and the Israelites played with all manner of instruments — harps, psalteries, timbrels, sistra, and cymbals. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> the threshing-floor of Nacon, the oxen stumbled, and Uzzah put out his hand to the Ark.

25|$|In the {{beginning}} of its colonization, many of Pennsylvania’s settlers occupied the land not through acquiring the legal rights, but by building on any unclaimed land they found, or squatting. The squatters came to the Palmyra area between 1717 and 1740. Because the squatters had no official documents stating <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> the land, {{it is difficult to}} precisely trace family migrations to and from the area. From looking at what records do exist, and by the people still living in the Palmyra area, {{it is clear that the}} first settlers to live near Palmyra came from two distinct nationalities, the Scotch-Irish and the German Palatinates.|$|E

The Mets won both games to close within a half game of the Cubs. The following day, the Mets swept a double header from the Montreal Expos. Coupled with a Cubs loss (who had slumped to a 9–17 record in their final 26 games), the Mets moved into first place {{for the first time ever}} during the 1969 season.|$|E
