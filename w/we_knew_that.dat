25|$|Was it a mistake? No, said Lise Meitner; Hahn was {{too good}} a chemist for that. But how could barium be formed from uranium? No larger {{fragments}} than protons or helium nuclei (alpha particles) had ever been chipped away from nuclei, and to chip off a large number not nearly enough energy was available. Nor {{was it possible that}} the uranium nucleus could have been cleaved right across. A nucleus was not like a brittle solid that can be cleaved or broken; George Gamow had suggested early on, and Bohr had given good arguments that a nucleus was much more like a liquid drop. Perhaps a drop could divide itself into two smaller drops in a more gradual manner, by first becoming elongated, then constricted, and finally being torn rather than broken in two? <b>We</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> there were strong forces that would resist such a process, just as the surface tension of an ordinary liquid drop tends to resist its division into two smaller ones. But nuclei differed from ordinary drops in one important way: they were electrically charged, and that was known to counteract the surface tension.|$|E

Because Deconstruction wanted to distribute a limited-edition version of the album, Sednaoui had to photograph a separate artwork and dedicate it to those editions.

[...] Doug Savant commented, [...] "For many years on this show, <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> Tom and Lynette were the grounding force on the street.

[...] Both actors expressed their desire for the couple to reunite by the series' end. Charles Mesure made his debut as new neighbor Ben Faulkner, a self-made contractor and Renee's new love interest.

500|$|Weiss {{said that}} they wanted to depict a {{full-fledged}} battle, [...] "From the beginning <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> one thing we'd never had on the show was a true medieval pitched battle where two sides bring all the forces they can into play in some battlefield that's somehow negotiated or agreed upon and they go at each other until one of them wins and the other one loses. This is a staple of human history, and we started to look through film samples of it. There really wasn't one that both made you feel {{what it was like to}} be there on the ground and gave you a sense of the geography of the battle." [...] According to Benioff, they also wanted to demonstrate the role luck plays in battle, [...] "Just to feel the kind of randomness of it where there's arrows falling from everywhere, people are getting killed, people are getting trampled by horses, and so much of it is just luck. Jon Snow is a very skilled combatant, but part of the reason he survives this battle is just he gets lucky".|$|E

He made his debut the next day, scoring the only {{goal of the}} game in the club's 1–0 win over Lincoln City at Sincil Bank. Three days later, Holroyd scored a hat-trick in Stevenage's 4–1 victory against Hereford United, taking his tally up to four goals in two games. Stevenage manager Graham Westley said [...] "He's lethal, <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> before he came to the club. He's been very {{impressive}} in his two games so far, his work ethic is excellent and he is a constant menace for opposition defences". Holroyd scored his fifth goal for Stevenage in the club's 2–1 home win against Burton Albion, turning sharply in the box to restore Stevenage's lead in the second-half. Earlier on in the same game, he missed a penalty after originally being fouled in the area. Holroyd scored his sixth goal for Stevenage in a 1–1 draw against Shrewsbury Town. Due to a host of postponements, Holroyd's final game for the club was a 1–0 home loss to Northampton Town on 11 December, and he returned to his parent club on Boxing Day. During his three-month loan spell, Holroyd scored six goals in twelve games.|$|E

[...] Bell also talked about the cliffhanger involving Simmons being absorbed by a Kree monolith: [...] "When we first started talking about the Monolith, <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> it needed to present a threat and we needed to demonstrate some of that threat and the promise of more story... It's easy to kill a character for shock value or whatever, and we did have a number of deaths this season, but ... we prefer to leave you with something to talk about, to walk away with. This is something that came up in the room, we talked about what it meant ...

[...] Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard also praised West Ham, stating: [...] "West Ham were brilliant, they gave us a really good game {{but we had a}} never-say-die attitude and we stuck in there, our best chance was on penalties as we did not have any energy left." [...] Due {{to the nature of the}} comeback, the match has come to be regarded as The Gerrard Final, teammate Peter Crouch summed up the effect Gerrard had on the match: [...] "When the injury-time board went up we thought our chance had gone, but it is always good to have a player like Steven Gerrard in your team."
