5|$|The Storm <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>going</b> to go {{with the}} colours of their state, Victoria (Navy blue with a white 'V'), but club {{consultant}} at the time, Peter McWhirter of the JAG fashion house, suggested that they should also have purple and gold to make their merchandise more attractive. These colours appear in the logo, however, on the home jersey they have varied. Between 1998 and 2004 these four colours also appeared but between 2005 and 2009, gold was completely removed and silver introduced. Between 2010–2012, gold returned and silver was omitted, purple also became the dominant colour in the jersey. For 2013 a new design was announced featuring a deeper V, with more navy blue in the jersey, gold disappeared along with most of the white, the lightning bolts were also changed to purple. During 2015 the jersey changed again for the first time not featuring a V at all, but the V returned somewhat along with the lightning bolts in 2016 with a manufacturer change. Over the years and in all variations of the Jersey, Navy Blue and Purple always remain the main colours.|$|E
25|$|Jermaine Lawson was {{the lone}} wicket-taker for West Indies in the second innings, but the target of 172 <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>going</b> to be too small, {{although}} there was hope with the score on 49 for 3. Mahela Jayawardene with 41 not out and Thilan Samaraweera with 51 steadied the ship with a partnership of 86, and Jayawardene and Dilshan saw Sri Lanka to the predictable six-wicket win – but, in all fairness, West Indies had overperformed.|$|E
25|$|In May 2015, Tonga took on Samoa in the 2015 Polynesian Cup at Cbus Super Stadium. The International {{was part}} of a triple header which also {{included}} the Melanesian Cup, between Papua New Guinea and Fiji, and the Junior Kangaroos against the Junior Kiwis. The game was an absolute thriller with the lead alternating between the teams and the biggest margin throughout the match was only 6 points. However, there <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>going</b> to be one winner in the see-saw affair and it was Samoa who upended Mate Ma'a Tonga to win the Polynesian Cup by 18–16.|$|E

25|$|With Luton's spell {{in the top}} flight finally over, it <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>going</b> to be {{difficult}} to keep hold of prize assets. So it proved when Mick Harford signed for Chelsea for £300,000. The first season in the new, three-division Football League almost saw Luton drop into the third tier of English football. The team was not helped by the involvement of Scottish duo Paul Telfer and Darren Salton in a motor accident early on in the season – under-21 international defender Salton was nearly killed, and never played again. Luton were bottom of the table shortly into the New Year, and Pleat reacted by procuring a loan deal to bring Luton-born England international Kerry Dixon to the club on loan from Southampton. Dixon gelled well alongside Phil Gray up front, and Luton stayed up.|$|E
25|$|The Grand Final {{against the}} Sydney Roosters <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>going</b> to be a tense battle with neither club having much {{affection for the}} other. The Bulldogs came from 13-6 down at halftime to triumph 16-13. This victory saw desperate Bulldogs defence absorb much {{punishment}} and keep the Roosters scoreless for the entire second half. It was a sweet result for the Bulldogs after enduring a number of nightmare seasons {{on and off the}} field. It showed the great character in the club and the values that can't be bought or manufactured. To defeat the Roosters made it even sweeter considering the rivalry and backgrounds of both clubs. Matt Utai scored two tries with Hazem El Masri also scoring. Willie Mason was named Clive Churchill Medal Winner. Stand-in captain Andrew Ryan, who ultimately make the winning tackle, stopping Roosters forward Michael Crocker from scoring the final seconds of the match.|$|E
25|$|Don {{signed a}} new {{contract}} with the Dodgers on February 16, 1959 for $8,500. At the Dodgers camp in Vero Beach, Florida, Demeter {{took the time to}} try to reinvent himself as a hitter. He <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>going</b> for the home run swing, which resulted in 32 strikeouts in just 106 at bats last season. Manager Walter Alston and new coach Pee Wee Reese would be his teachers. Reese stated that Don was upper-cutting at the ball with each swing, and Pee Wee had him cut down on his swing, which led to immediate results. Alston had Demeter stand outside the batting cage and hit ground balls to the infielders while waiting for his turn in the cage. Don and Alston agreed that the simple exercise helped level off Demeter's swing. While adapting his new batting style, Demeter injured himself on February 27 by pulling a muscle in his right leg. It was not serious, and Demeter returned to spring training play in less than a week. On March 12, he had a game-winning single with the bases loaded against the Cincinnati Reds in the 9th inning to give the Dodgers the 7-6 win.|$|E

25|$|Registration 1 {{sold for}} £7.25million {{and is the}} highest price paid for a plate – in the United Arab Emirates. It was {{purchased}} by Abu Dhabi businessman Saeed Abdul Ghaffar Khouri in 2008. As of 2014, the registration 25O broke a new record of being the highest priced plate sold at a DVLA auction. Registration 25O was purchased for £518,000 by Ferrari dealer John Collins in 2014; the plate now sits pride of place on a Ferrari 250 SWB once owned by rock star Eric Clapton. Registration F1 and RAC3R have been considered as the most desirable plates amongst supercar and Formula One fanatics. The registration RAC3R is a suffix style plate that was issued {{in the same year}} British racing driver James Hunt won the Formula One World Championship in 1976. The plate covers an endless list of all the different forms of racing, making it extremely desirable. Since there has been a big fuss over race related plates the Driver & Vehicle Licensing Agency has made a racer game for motorists to celebrate the huge profits made from the sales of private plates. The celebration took place at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in 2010. Unlike horse racing, Formula One racing has become more popular in the last few years, hence why the F1 plate <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>going</b> to sell well. On 25 January 2008 the registration F1 sold for £440,000 to Bradford Car design entrepreneur Afzal Kahn. The plate was previously owned and sold by Essex County Council and was sold to raise money for training young drivers. Today the F1 plate has a valuation less than the winning bid with the price tag stagnating on that particular plate. Originally the plate was affixed in 1904 to the Panhard et Levassor of the then County Surveyor. Previously, a few months before the F1 plate was purchased, the S1 plate sold for £397,500 at an auction in September 2007 by an anonymous buyer making it the second most expensive number plate ever sold in the UK. The S1 plate was originally owned by Sir John H A MacDonald, the Lord Kingsburgh and was Edinburgh's first ever number plate. Within the space of two years the S1 plate sold for £65,500 more than the M1 plate that sold at auction in Goodwood on 7 July 2006. Registrations 1D VIP1 51NGH K1NGS and 1O are also marked as considerably expensive plates that have sold publicly in excess of six figures.|$|E

[...] Although the film <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>going</b> to be centered on Gary, Roy Scheider was offered a cameo.

500|$|On April 25, 2014 it was {{announced}} that Hundred Proof Club, Think Famous Productions, Akela Family and JDK Entertainment were suing Sony Music and King for fraud in the Sony and FIFA's SuperSong competition.

500|$|In August 2016, the new {{director}} of S.H.I.E.L.D. was explained {{to be a new}} character to the series, portrayed by Jason O'Mara. The character was described as having [...] "Marvel roots [...] go back to the 1940s". The {{new director}} <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>going</b> to be new to the series, as the executive producers felt that replacing Coulson with someone he knows [...] "wouldn’t [...] as much tension to mine from". With the airing of the episode, the character was revealed to be an Inhuman with super strength called Jeffrey. Closed captions for the episode gave his last name as Mace, and a week later the executive producers confirmed the character to be Jeffrey Mace, who goes by Patriot in the comics.|$|E

He continued, [...] "Whenever I came back, I was excited to come back, and the scenes all seemed pretty amazing. I was so happy to re-embrace the character." [...] According to Parkinson, he was sorry that Rickon would die but his manner of death was a compensation: [...] "It was a cool death, and it <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>going</b> to be a good death, so at the same time, I was pretty happy." ...|$|E
500|$|Responsible for the film's {{production}} design was Rick Heinrichs, who Burton {{intended to use}} on Superman Lives. While the production crew <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>going</b> to build {{a substantial number of}} sets, the decision was taken early on that to fulfill Burton's vision best would necessitate shooting Sleepy Hollow in a totally controlled environment at Leavesden Film Studios. The {{production design}} was influenced [...] by Burton's love for Hammer Film Productions and Black Sunday—particularly the supernatural feel they evoked as a result of being filmed primarily on sound stages. Heinrichs was also influenced by American colonial architecture, German Expressionism, Dr. Seuss illustrations, and Hammer's Dracula Has Risen from the Grave. One sound stage at Leavesden was dedicated to the [...] "Forest to Field" [...] set, for the scene in which the Headless Horseman races out of the woods and into a field. This stage was then transformed into, variously, a graveyard, a corn field, a field of harvested wheat, a churchyard, and a snowy battlefield. In addition, a small backlot area was devoted to a New York City street and waterfront tank.|$|E
500|$|St. Gatien made a full recovery, {{and made}} his {{seasonal}} debut in the Gold Cup over {{two and a half}} miles at Royal Ascot on June 18. Much interest in the Gold Cup was created by a [...] "sealed entry" [...] in the race by the Duke of Portland, with hopes that it would contain the name of St. Simon. St. Simon did not appear, but St. Gatien's opponents for the race included Eole, the outstanding older horse in America in 1883, and the 1884 2000 Guineas winner Scot Free. St. Gatien, who started the 1/3 favourite <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>going</b> easily and overtook Eole a furlong out before pulling clear to win [...] "in a canter" [...] by three lengths. On the following day he faced Eole again in the three mile Alexandra Plate which also attracted the leading French colt Hermitage.

500|$|Russell T Davies {{announced}} that Astrid Peth {{would be the}} next companion after Martha Jones (played by Freema Agyeman) on 14 August 2007. Astrid's surname, Peth, was confirmed in the Christmas edition of Radio Times. Davies has stated that the character <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>going</b> to be a [...] "one-off" [...] even before Minogue was cast and that Astrid would demonstrate [...] "a whole new take– again– on what a companion can be". The name Astrid Peth generated some speculation before the episode's broadcast over the findings that Astrid is an anagram of TARDIS, and that Peth means thing in Welsh. However, the episode established no such connection. On Doctor Who Confidential, Minogue describes Astrid as a [...] "dreamer" [...] and that meeting with the Doctor rekindles Astrid's desire to explore. Later in his book A Writer's Tale Davies discussed with co-author Benjamin Cook how he had originally named the character [...] "Peth" [...] in a treatment but it bugged him, he later renamed her to [...] "Astrid" [...] giving the reason that it [...] "...sounds more spacey, more like a futuristing [...] Doctor's companion".|$|E

Halliwell wanted the video for the song to be very different in style to her previous single [...] "Look At Me", as that one was filmed in Prague in the freezing cold, and she wanted something to connect with her fans. According to her, the video was also pretty easy to get: [...] "a yacht, {{a girl in a}} bikini and some sexy boy dancers to keep both sets of fans [...] happy". After the video was released, the singer got a huge amount of attention from it. [...] "People {{came up to me and}} told me how great and how sexy it was. They also told me I looked really healthy, but how wrong they were. I wasn't healthy because I wasn't eating properly and although I was slim at the time, that was a mirage too because the tough regime of the diet <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>going</b> to lead me to binge and put the weight back on", and later, she began taking recovery meetings for bulimia.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the official EastEnders website, Oberman detailed the background dynamic to Chrissie and Den's relationship as it existed before their appearance on the show: [...] "They were a real match for each other and ran a successful wine bar. The couple made a good team, but he <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>going</b> off with other women. She'd end up leaving him, but they'd always end up back together." [...] Den's womanising and philandering nature was deliberately set against Chrissie's strong and forceful personality, and culminated on-screen in his affair with Kate Mitchell (Jill Halfpenny). The plot was praised by television editor Ru Green as being one of the [...] "better storylines" [...] during an otherwise weak year for the show, with media attention at the time profiling Chrissie's dramatic plans for revenge. Commenting on the storyline's climax, a report in The Sun spotlighted how [...] "instead of collapsing in tears" [...] as many female characters in EastEnders are wont to do, Chrissie [...] "proves that hell hath no fury like a woman scorned". The climax, which saw Chrissie cut off Kate Mitchell's hair in retribution for the affair, was a highlight for Oberman and an important dramatic milestone for her character: [...] "cutting off Jill Halfpenny's hair in the salon... was a really great episode. I loved working with Jill and I think that put Chrissie on the map." ...|$|E
