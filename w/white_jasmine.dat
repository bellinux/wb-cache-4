40|$|Abstract Among {{the total}} of 146 {{volatiles}} extracted by SPME from the headspace of some black and white rice bran samples, twenty-eight terpenoid odorants were acculately identified. Most of these terpenoids possess good aroma character and are varied among three groups of Thai rice; black glutinous, black non-glutinous, and white non-glutinous. Of these three groups, black non-glutinous rice contains the greater number of these monoterpenoids. However, {{the content of the}} major terpenoid odorants, which are limonene, trans-β-ocimene, β-cymene, and linalool, is the highest in the bran of <b>white</b> Thai <b>jasmine</b> rice, Khao Dawk Mali 105 (KDML 105). An herbaceous odorant, myrcene, occurs in the bran of all black rice varieties but not in the bran of white rice. The flavor type of rice bran using these rice bran terpenoids was successfully classified using the chemometric principle component analysis method...|$|R

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to study the relationship between the eating quality of cooked rice and near infrared spectra measured by a Fourier Transform near infrared (FT–NIR) Spectrometer. Samples of milled: parboiled rice, <b>white</b> rice, new <b>Jasmine</b> rice (harvested in 2012) and aged Jasmine rice (harvested in 2006 or during the period 2007 – 2011) were used in this study. The eating quality of the cooked rice, i. e., adhesiveness, hardness, dryness, whiteness and aroma, were evaluated by trained sensory panelists. FT–NIR spectroscopy models for predicting the eating quality of cooked rice were established using the partial least squares regression. Among the eating quality, the stickiness model indicated its highest prediction ability (i. e., R_ val^ 2 = 0. 71; RMSEP = 0. 65; Bias = 0. 00; RPD = 1. 87) and SEP/SD of 2.
