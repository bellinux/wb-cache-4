25|$|The {{far field}} pattern is thus seen {{to consist of}} a {{transverse}} electromagnetic (TEM) wave, with electric and magnetic fields {{at right angles to}} each other and at right angles to the direction of propagation (the direction of r, as <b>we</b> <b>assumed</b> the source to be at the origin). The electric polarization, in the θ direction, is coplanar with the source current (in the Z direction), while the magnetic field is at right angles to that, in the φ direction. It can be seen from these equations, and also in the animation, that the fields at these distances are exactly in phase. Both fields fall according to 1/r, with the power thus falling according to 1/r2 as dictated by the inverse square law.|$|E

500|$|Bure was {{selected}} 113th {{overall in the}} sixth round Draft by the Vancouver Canucks, following his rookie season with CSKA Moscow. The pick was controversial, as the Canucks had chosen him seemingly a year ahead of his eligible draft season.
