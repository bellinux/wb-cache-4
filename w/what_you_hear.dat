500|$|In {{response}} to the positive reception from listeners, Williams said, [...] "We love the reaction that we get [...] They know what we're talking about." [...] Shay Haley, {{a member of the}} band, went on saying, [...] "Me, personally, I'm shocked it's being embraced the way it is. I feel like it sticks out like a sore thumb in comparison to <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> every day on the radio… It's just our personal observation of what we've seen {{over the past couple of}} years, so we felt like making a party record out of it." ...|$|E
500|$|Hogarth {{aimed to}} [...] "bring Ed's guitar sound {{into the modern}} era, but {{maintaining}} all the DNA of the past." [...] He suggested that the guitar sound be split naturally between stereo channels, instead of separating lead guitar to the left channel and panning effects to the right by using two guitar amplifiers placed far apart. The idea {{was to have a}} guitar sound [...] "that was wide and mono, and not digital delay-driven, and it's <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> on the record, with only a few overdubs". A more complex structure would be utilized for Wolfgang's bass, as the band wanted [...] "a bass sound that covered the whole spectrum, from high to low and clean to dirty", and his instrument was recorded by up to eight separate microphones. A multi-mic set-up was also employed for Alex's drums, with most of the final drumming coming from overhead microphones. Roth's vocals were all recorded at Henson, without compression.|$|E
500|$|Motolla {{selected}} Cory Rooney as {{the executive}} producer of Irresistible. Most of the recording and mixing works were done at Sony Music Studios, New York City and was completed over a time span of eight months. Rooney also coordinated the recording process while Robert Williams miked the vocals. Sony's C-800G Tube Condenser Microphone, equipped with a dual large diaphragm and electronically selectable pick-up pattern, was used to record the vocals. In an interview with Sony's SoundByte magazine in 2002, Williams said of his choice: [...] "In the studio, it comes down to <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear.</b> [...] She has such a big range, from a whisper to really belting it out, and you need a microphone that can handle the range without distortion." [...] He had used the microphone for Simpson's first album and felt that it suited her well. He also noted that on ballads, [...] "the S's and wet sounds of lips" [...] are important to the texture of the song. According to him, as Simpson's vocals tended to be [...] "bright", he edited the lower ends of her voice to equalize the track.|$|E

500|$|In 1969, the Revue's {{profile in}} their home country was raised after opening for the Rolling Stones on their US tour. In 1970, they {{performed}} on The Ed Sullivan Show. The tour's success resulted in the Revue signing with Liberty Records, where they released two albums, Come Together and Workin' Together, released in 1970 and 1971 respectively. Come Together produced the duo's first top 40 single with their cover of Sly and the Family Stone's [...] "I Want to Take You Higher." [...] Come Together marked {{a turning point in}} their careers in which they switched from their usual R repertoire to incorporate more rock tunes. In early 1971, their cover of Creedence Clearwater Revival's [...] "Proud Mary" [...] became their biggest hit, reaching number 4 on the Hot 100 and selling over a million copies, winning them a Grammy for Best R Performance by a Duo or Group. Later in 1971, their live album, <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>Hear</b> Is What You Get, taken from a performance at Carnegie Hall, was their first to be certified gold. In 1972, Ike Turner created the studio, Bolic Sounds, near their home in Inglewood. After Liberty was bought by United Artists Records, the duo was assigned to that label, releasing ten albums in a three-year period. The duo's final major hit single, [...] "Nutbush City Limits", was released in 1973, reaching number 22 on the Hot 100, and peaking at number 4 in the UK. In 1974, Tina released her first solo album, Tina Turns the Country On!, winning a Grammy nomination.|$|E
500|$|St. Anger {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics; the album holds {{a score of}} 65 out of 100, based on 20 reviews, on review-aggregating website Metacritic. Adrien Begrand of PopMatters noted positive and negative aspects of the album, saying: [...] "While it's an ungodly mess at times, <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> on this album is a band playing with passion {{for the first time}} in years." [...] Producer Bob Rock said that it was intended to sound like [...] "a band jamming together in a garage for the first time, and the band just happened to be Metallica." [...] Talking about the album, Greg Kot of Blender said, [...] "It may be too late to rehabilitate Metallica's image, but once again, their music is all about bringing the carnage." [...] Writing for NME, Ian Watson said that: ...the songs are a stripped back, heroically brutal reflection of this fury. You get the sense that, as with their emotional selves, they've taken metal apart and started again from scratch. There's no space wasted here, no time for petty guitar solos or downtuned bass trickery, just a focused, relentless attack. Johnny Loftus of AllMusic praised the album and described it as a [...] "punishing, unflinching document of internal struggle—taking listeners inside the bruised yet vital body of Metallica, but ultimately revealing the alternately torturous and defiant demons that wrestle inside Hetfield's brain. St. Anger is an immediate record." [...] Barry Walter of Rolling Stone magazine also had a positive reaction to the direction taken in [...] "St. Anger", stating: [...] "No wonder there's an authenticity to St. Anger's fury that none of the band's rap-metal followers can touch." [...] He also went further to note the lack of commercial influence and modern rock aspects of previous albums, continuing: [...] "There's no radio-size, four-minute rock here, no pop-friendly choruses, no ballads, no solos, no wayward experimentation." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Acrobat" [...] {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{personal}} songs on Achtung Baby with Bono acknowledging personal weakness, contradictions, and inadequacy. The Edge noted that the song contained [...] "a bit of venom", likening it to [...] "the bitter, John Lennon tradition of 'Working Class Hero', slightly snarling and cynical." [...] Bono stated [...] "as we moved from the eighties to the nineties, I stopped throwing rocks at the obvious symbols of power and the abuse of it. I started throwing rocks at my own hypocrisy... 'Acrobat' [...] 'Don't believe <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear,</b> don't believe what you see / If you just close your eyes / You can feel the enemy...' I can't remember it, but the point is: you start to see the world in a different way, and you're part of the problem, not just part of the solution". In 2006, he noted it was [...] "a song about being a hypocrite, and I think we all can be and I certainly have been. And you know, you exact very high standards on people in the world but then you don't live them personally", noting the theme was most evident in the lyric [...] "I must be an acrobat to talk like this and act like that". Hot Press editor Niall Stokes felt The Edge's guitar playing combined elements of [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] with [...] "Bullet the Blue Sky". Speaking of its theme he said [...] "at its heart is an awareness of the ravages of time, and what it does to people and to relationships. But beyond that, there is the self-awareness that, itself, comes only with experience... Bono acknowledges his own weakness and inadequacy. He is more conscious now than ever before of the contradictions in his own position." [...] Andy Greene of Rolling Stone believed the [...] "aggressive and venomous" [...] song reflected Bono's thoughts during the album sessions, saying [...] "Nearly every lyric brims with rage... It was a new decade and it was quite possible they were about to be dismissed as a relic of the past." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{third and}} final session, in the evening on 15 October, {{produced}} four more recordings that completed the album— [...] "The Way Young Lovers Do" [...] "Sweet Thing", [...] "Ballerina" [...] and [...] "Slim Slow Slider". Davis expressed to Rolling Stone {{that there was a}} [...] "certain feel about a seven-to-ten o' clock session" [...] and that [...] "the ambience of that time of day was all through everything we played". Both [...] "Sweet Thing" [...] and [...] "Ballerina" [...] were originally scheduled for the session, but the search for a 'closer' consumed a considerable amount of time. [...] They attempted (and rejected) a number of songs until Morrison suggested [...] "Slim Slow Slider". [...] "I don't think we'd ever done [...] live," [...] recalls Payne. [...] " [...] had a book full of songs... I don't know why he decided to do it...And we were first doing it with the drums, with Richard Davis and Connie Kay and the guitar player and the vibe player and me and Van— all of us were playing. Then I started playing soprano sax on the thing, and Lew said, 'OK, I wanna try it again. Start again. And I want just the bass, the soprano sax, and Van.'" [...] It was a successful take, but it also came with a very long coda, prompting Merenstein to make a large cut during the editing process. Many of the tracks on Astral Weeks would be subjected to edits (mainly to tighten the performances), but the one on [...] "Slim Slow Slider" [...] was easily the most substantial. [...] "I would estimate three, five minutes of instrumental stuff," [...] says Payne. [...] "We went through stages [...] we got to be avant-garde kind of weird, which is <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> after the splice – all that weird stuff we're playing – but there was a whole progression to that." [...] According to Merenstein, before he cut it, the coda [...] "was a long, long ending that went nowhere, that just carried on from minute to minute...If it had [...] relativity to the tune itself, I would have left it there." ...|$|E

[...] Skip Lievsay, the film's sound editor called this approach [...] "quite a remarkable experiment," [...] and added that [...] "suspense thrillers in Hollywood are traditionally done almost entirely with music.

I got to work with some people who were instrumental in shaping the careers of artists who heavily influence me. Artists like Otis Redding, Sam & Dave and Sam Cooke. Being entrenched {{in that sort of}} environment really caused me to go 'You know what dude. Do what you want to do. Do what comes natural to you'." [...] Sebastian said it was a turning point for him, adding, [...] "From that Memphis thing a few years ago it's always going to start with me being true to who I want to be and what I enjoy singing." [...] Sebastian feels his soul roots remained even when he delved into electro dance music with the single [...] "Who's That Girl" [...] from his previous album, explaining it was an old school Sam Cooke type of melody, with modern lyrics, over a dance track. He said, [...] "I had that melody, and I could have gone so many ways with it.

2500|$|Rock {{and roll}} music {{first came to}} Carnegie Hall when Bill Haley & His Comets {{appeared}} in a variety benefit concert on May 6, 1955. Rock acts were not regularly booked at the Hall however, until February 12, 1964, when The Beatles performed two shows during their historic {{first trip to the}} United States.

[...] "Led Zeppelin became the first hard rock act to play Carnegie Hall since the Rolling Stones tore the place up some five years ago." [...] Two concerts were performed October 17, 1969. Since then numerous rock, blues, jazz and country performers have appeared at the hall every season. Jethro Tull released the tapes recorded on its presentation in a 1970 Benefit concert, in the 2010 re-release of the Stand Up album. Ike & Tina Turner performed a concert April 1, 1971, which resulted in their album <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>Hear</b> is What You Get.
