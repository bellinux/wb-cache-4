The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate associations between the timing of infant motor development and subsequent sports participation during adolescence. Prospective observational study. The study population consisted of 9, 009 individuals from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966. Motor development was assessed by parental report at age 1 year, using age at <b>walking</b> with <b>support</b> and age at standing unaided. At follow up aged 14 years, data were collected on the school grade awarded for physical education (PE). Self report was used to collect information on the frequency of sports participation and number of different sports reported. Earlier infant motor development was associated with improved school PE grade, for age at <b>walking</b> <b>supported</b> (p< 0. 001) and standing unaided (p = < 0. 001). Earlier infant motor development, in terms of age at <b>walking</b> <b>supported,</b> was {{positively associated with}} the number of different sports reported (p = 0. 003) and with a greater frequency of sports participation (p = 0. 043). These associations were independent of gestational age and birth weight, as well as father's social class and body mass index at age 14 years. Earlier infant motor development may predict higher levels of physical activity as indicated by higher school PE grade, participation in a greater number of different types of sports and increased frequency of sports participation. Identification of young children with slower motor development may allow early targeted interventions to improve motor skills and thereby increase physical activity in later life...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{purpose of}} this study is the {{development}} of an admittance motion command generator for controlling the motion of a robotic <b>walking</b> <b>support</b> system used to guide a user walking at a uniform or user-adjustable walking velocity along a preplanned walking path, as illustrated by parametric spline functions. The correlation between a preplanned walking path and the force exerted by a user is usually complicated and indirect because of the high nonlinearity of parametric spline functions. Therefore, an interpolation algorithm based on Taylor’s expansion is developed in this study to correlate the preplanned walking path with a desired linear velocity. When the desired linear velocity is set as a uniform walking velocity command, the robotic <b>walking</b> <b>support</b> system can guide a user walking along a preplanned walking path at uniform walking velocity. Furthermore, for the robotic <b>walking</b> <b>support</b> system to be able to guide the user at user-adjustable walking velocity, the concept of admittance motion control is employed to correlate the desired linear velocity with the force exerted by the user. Several experiments are conducted using a robotic cane that was developed in this study, and the experimental results show the validity of the proposed approaches.

This sole shape is designed to provide a recovery force by pressing onto a floor in cases where the bodyinclines too much.

A “Health Economic Assessment Tool (HEAT) for cycling” was developed which is being used in several countries. Conclusions: There is a need for a more consistent approach to the quantification of health benefits from cycling and walking. This project is providing guidance and an illustrative tool for cycling for practical application. Results show that substantial savings can be expected.

Temporal cortical neurons {{are known to}} respond to visual dynamic-action displays. Many human psychophysical and functional imaging studies examining biological motion perception have used treadmill walking, in contrast to previous macaque single-cell studies. We assessed the coding of locomotion in rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) temporal cortex using movies of stationary walkers, varying both form and motion (i. e., different facing directions) or varying only the frame sequence (i. e., forward vs backward walking). The majority of superior temporal sulcus and inferior temporal neurons were selective for facing direction, whereas a minority distinguished forward from backward <b>walking.</b> <b>Support</b> vector machines using the temporal cortical population responses as input classified facing direction well, but forward and backward walking less so. Classification performance for the latter improved markedly when the within-action response modulation was considered, reflecting differences in momentary body poses within the locomotion sequences. Responses to static pose presentations predicted the responses {{during the course of}} the action. Analyses of the responses to walking sequences wherein the start frame was varied across trials showed that some neurons also carried a snapshot sequence signal. Such sequence information was present in neurons that responded to static snapshot presentations and in neurons that required motion. Our data suggest that actions are analyzed by temporal cortical neurons using distinct mechanisms. Most neurons predominantly signal momentary pose. In addition, temporal cortical neurons, including those responding to static pose, are sensitive to pose sequence, which can contribute to the signaling of learned action sequences. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the relationship between}} the age of development of 5 locomotor behaviors, the level of infant activity for the locomotor behaviors, and the performance of the sample of infants on standardized indices of infant development (Fagan Test of Infant Intelligence, FTII; Bayley Scales of Infant Development, BSID-II). A total of 157 infants were assessed at 6, 9, and 12 months for their activity levels on the 5 locomotor behaviors of interest, and the age at which each locomotor behavior occurred was obtained through records maintained by each infants 2 ̆ 7 caregiver. The results of the regression path analysis indicates that the timing of acquisition of locomotor behaviors is reciprocally related to how active infants are, and that over time these factors contribute to how infants perform on more global measures of development. The main implications of these findings are that the rate of development of future infant locomotor behavior was influenced by how active the infant was in a current locomotor behavior. The acquisition of specific locomotor behaviors (i. e., standing unsupported and <b>walking</b> <b>supported)</b> was significantly and negatively correlated with infant performance on a Psychomotor Development Index of a standardized measure of infant development (BSID-II, Bayley, 1993). ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} a model was {{introduced}} which simulates {{the effects of}} passive <b>walking</b> <b>support</b> on the human body. Passive support was designed with the goal to reduce human energy expenditure for walking. The XPED exoskeleton and three alternative exoskeleton configurations were tested. The XPED is an exoskeleton with two artificial tendons, passive elastic structures which provide a moment at the hip, knee and ankle joint. In previous research, simulation showed 42. 5 % reduction in joint work. In experiments however, no reduction in energy expenditure was measured. The old simulation model lacks modelling of human anatomy. This was considered a very important reason for the mismatch which was seen between reduction in energy expenditure in the model and with experiments. The new model includes the modelling of human muscles, tendons, and dissipation of negative work. This also enabled new measures for energy expenditure: muscle work, in which eccentric muscle work contributes less than concentric muscle work, and muscle moments. It was hypothesised that with this new model the work efficiency, the amount of reduction in work, of the XPED exoskeleton would be predicted much lower. The new model showed 37. 0 % reduction in muscle work. Although efficiency was lower, the presence of anatomic structures in the model did not greatly affect the functionality of the XPED. An optimisation of the XPED parameters to the new work measure for energy expenditure even brought work efficiency up to 43. 6 %. The other support configurations provided support at the hip, at the knee, or at the hip and the knee joint. It was hypothesised that these configurations were as efficient as the XPED, since mechanical work at the ankle is already performed passively to large extent. This had to be rejected. Work efficiencies of the hip, knee and combined support were respectively 18. 7 %, 18. 4 % and 37. 1 %. Although efficiencies were lower, these configurations are still worth evaluating since they have the benefit that the exoskeleton can be smaller and that the naturally present and very efficient energy saving mechanism in the ankle is not disturbed. A pilot experiment where these configurations were tested with the LOPES exoskeleton did not prove reduction in energy expenditure.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{critical}} factors in the quality of elderly lives is their ability to move. As the size of the ageing society grows, more elderly people suffer from walking impairments. Most of them prefer to stay at home due to the shortage of the nursing care staff, since they deal with the daily challenges alone. Robotics researchers have developed various intelligent <b>walking</b> <b>support</b> systems {{to meet the needs of}} elderly and handicapped people. A particular problem in path tracking for such systems is maintaining the tracking performance, which is affected by the center of gravity (CG) shifts and load changes due to human-walker interactions. This thesis focuses on design of feedback controllers for safe motion of intelligent walker (i-walker) systems robust to CG shifts and load changes. Our design follows a two level approach, one for kinematics, the other for dynamics. The high level kinematic controller is designed based on integrator backstepping to produce desired velocities required for trajectory tracking. The low level dynamic controller is composed of a feedback linearization unit and a linear feedback controller to apply the control torque for tracking the desired velocity produced by the high level kinematic controller. As dynamic controllers, proportional-derivative (PD) and sliding mode controllers (SMCs) are designed. In our initial design, we assume that all system states are available. However, in the actual case, even if the wheel velocities can be measured with some sensor devices like tachometers, the measurements carry noise, which poses important problems in control algorithms. To obtain the estimates of the wheel velocities, avoiding the noise problems, the design of sliding mode observers and high gain observers is studied. The state feedback PD and SMC schemes are later integrated with these observers to form implementable output feedback controllers. In practice, the human mass and the distance due to the CG shift depend on the user. To address this issue, the output feedback control designs are further made adaptive, integrating with a parameter identifier to estimate these variables. The parameter identifier design involves a linear parametric model of the i-walker system dynamics and a least-square adaptive law based on this parametric model. Adaptive versions of the above observers and control designs are done utilizing estimated parameters and states. The effectiveness and applicability of the proposed controllers are verified via various simulations in MATLAB/Simulink environment...|$|E

60|$|After {{this the}} bride ascended by steps {{to one of}} the shelves or stone recesses, which formed {{convenient}} sofas or couches round the walls of the apartment, and there, seated on cushions, submitted to be arrayed in bridal apparel. None but a lady's pen could do full justice to her stupendous toilet. We shall therefore do no more than state that the ludicrously high head-dress, in particular, was a thing of unimaginable splendour, and that her ornaments generally were so heavy as to render her incapable of <b>walking</b> without <b>support.</b>|$|R

The article presents new results on room-level indoor localization, using cellular Received Signal Strength fingerprints collected with a standard cellular handset programmed to perform fast scans of the 900 and 1800 Megahertz GSM bands as a user explores an indoor environment at a normal <b>walking</b> pace. <b>Support</b> Vector Machines are used {{to deal with the}} high dimensionality of the fingerprints. The study demonstrates that an appropriately programmed standard cellular handset can provide a simple, inexpensive solution for accurate room-level indoor localization...|$|R

Monitoring of {{physical activity}} is possible in daily life by using mobile sensors such as acceleration sensors. The recognition of periodic activity types like walking, cycling, car driving etc. is easy to perform. However, the identification of transitions between physical activities is difficult, because those events are nonrecurring and unique. The estimation about the share of standing or sitting during work is interesting {{for the design of}} the modem workplace. Human ergonomics demand for a limitation of standing work; this may even be enforced by the legal protection of working mothers to improve the working condition. The recognition of standing und sitting is furthermore useful within the home living area design. Hereby a detection of staying, sitting and <b>walking</b> <b>supports</b> the assessment of the activities of daily life. This paper addresses the methodology of mobile physical activity recognition of transitions between sitting und standing by using only one three-dimensional acceleration sensor. The recognition is performed by using n synthetic kernel signal arid a correlation of the measurement signal. For the evaluation, a detection application has been developed which uses the build-in sensors of a standard mobile phone. The evaluation inc 1 uded 12 subjects and the result show that mobile recognition of activity transitions is possible...|$|R
