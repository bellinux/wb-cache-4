5|$|Angelou's {{primary role}} in Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas was stage performer, but in The Heart of a <b>Woman</b> <b>she</b> changes {{from someone who}} uses others' method of expression—the songs and dances of the African, Caribbean, and African-American oral tradition—to a writer. Angelou makes this {{decision}} for political reasons as she becomes more involved with the civil rights movement, and {{so that she can}} care for her son. For the first time in Angelou's autobiographies, she begins to think of herself as a writer and recounts her literary development. Angelou begins to identify with other Black women writers {{for the first time in}} The Heart of a <b>Woman.</b> <b>She</b> has been influenced by several writers since her childhood, but this is the first time she mentions female authors. Up to this point, her identification has been with male writers; her new affiliations with female writers is due to her emerging feminism.|$|E

5|$|In June 1903, {{supervised}} by Gabriel Lippmann, Curie was awarded her doctorate from the University of Paris. That month {{the couple were}} invited to the Royal Institution in London {{to give a speech}} on radioactivity; being a <b>woman,</b> <b>she</b> was prevented from speaking, and Pierre alone was allowed to. Meanwhile, a new industry began developing, based on radium. The Curies did not patent their discovery and benefited little from this increasingly profitable business.|$|E
5|$|In the flashback, Byers, {{a public}} affairs {{officer for the}} FCC, attends a {{computer}} and electronics convention.

5|$|Internet venues {{unrelated}} to medical issues {{have also been}} the audience for such cases. A member of an online fan club for the musical Rent divulged numerous illnesses that caused her to slip {{in and out of}} comas, prompting some cast members to send sympathy cards. When other fan club members expressed their concern, even purchasing airline tickets to visit the sick <b>woman,</b> <b>she</b> reported that she had immediately improved.|$|E

5|$|Angelou later gained fame as {{an author}} and a poet, most notably her first autobiography, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings. In her fourth autobiography, The Heart of a <b>Woman,</b> <b>she</b> downplays her singing career and assigns little {{importance}} to Miss Calypso. In 1995, the album was re-released as a CD {{during a period of}} customer interest in 1950s exotica. Its artistry was re-examined in light of Angelou's later fame; it was said to exemplify the calypso music of the period, spiced with a feeling for the tradition's roots.|$|E
5|$|Je Me Souviens was {{published}} in 1910, after Vivien's death. That same year, Barney published Actes et Entr'actes (Acts and Interludes), {{a collection of short}} plays and poems. One of the plays was Equivoque (Ambiguity), a revisionist version on the legend of Sappho's death: Instead of throwing herself off a cliff for the love of Phaon the sailor, she does so out of grief that Phaon is marrying the <b>woman</b> <b>she</b> loves. The play incorporates quotations from Sappho's fragments, with Barney's own footnotes in Greek.|$|E

5|$|Palomino Sue {{hails from}} Abilene, Texas. Her {{father was a}} wagon master. She arrived at Boys' Ranch after a trip on the wagon her father was driving was intercepted by Indians. She was the only survivor. When expressing a desire to get {{involved}} in fighting, Clay Duncan insists that, because it's too dangerous for a <b>woman,</b> <b>she</b> must remain at the ranch. She agrees, but her acquiescence was a pretence, as she later joins the fray, offering opportune assistance. Similar scenes recur in her two subsequent appearances in issues #5 and 6.|$|E

The agents talk to Sharon, who says that the {{marriage}} failed because of Skinner's emotional distance.

However, Mulder believes that Skinner may be having visions of a succubus, a female demon, with the mention of similar symptoms of people's bad dreams they've experienced.|$|E

5|$|Two years later, when Wollstonecraft {{published}} the Rights of <b>Woman,</b> <b>she</b> extended {{many of the}} arguments she had begun in Rights of Men. If all people should be judged on their merits, she wrote, women {{should be included in}} that group. In both texts, Wollstonecraft emphasizes that the virtue of the British nation is dependent on the virtue of its people. To a great extent, she collapses the distinction between private and public and demands that all educated citizens be offered the chance to participate in the public sphere.|$|E
5|$|When she was {{ten years}} old, Maria began {{attending}} the boarding school of J. Sikorska; next she attended a gymnasium for girls, from which she graduated on 12 June 1883 with a gold medal. After a collapse, possibly due to depression, she spent the following year in the countryside with relatives of her father, {{and the next year}} with her father in Warsaw, where she did some tutoring. Unable to enroll in a regular institution of higher education because she was a <b>woman,</b> <b>she</b> and her sister Bronisława became involved with the clandestine Flying University (sometimes translated as Floating University), a Polish patriotic institution of higher learning that admitted women students.|$|E
5|$|After {{eight other}} {{publishers}} had rejected Philosopher's Stone, Bloomsbury offered Rowling a £2,500 advance for its publication. Despite Rowling's statement {{that she did}} not have any particular age group in mind when beginning to write the Harry Potter books, the publishers initially targeted children aged nine to eleven. On the eve of publishing, Rowling was asked by her publishers to adopt a more gender-neutral pen name in order to appeal to the male members of this age group, fearing {{that they would not be}} interested in reading a novel they knew to be written by a <b>woman.</b> <b>She</b> elected to use J. K. Rowling (Joanne Kathleen Rowling), using her grandmother's name as her second name because she has no middle name.|$|E

5|$|As a child, Dalton felt {{jealous of}} boys {{for the freedom}} they enjoyed. They could travel alone without {{worrying}} about their reputation and were often bribed to attend school, while girls were, in her opinion, educated reluctantly. One of her teachers {{thought it would be}} wasteful for her to study algebra, as she already had sufficient education for a housewife. As a young <b>woman,</b> <b>she</b> felt that women lived on a higher moral level than men. She saw polygamy as a way to allow more women to marry the few good men, arguing that it gave more women the opportunity to marry. She also considered it ironic that prostitution was tolerated but polygamy was considered depraved.|$|E
5|$|Beatrice Hicks {{was born}} in 1919 in Orange, New Jersey, to William Lux Hicks, a {{chemical}} engineer, and Florence Benedict. Hicks decided {{at an early age}} that she wished to be an engineer. While her parents neither supported nor opposed Hicks' desired career path, some of her teachers and classmates tried to discourage her from becoming an engineer, viewing it as a socially unacceptable role for a <b>woman.</b> <b>She</b> graduated from Orange High School in 1935 and received a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from Newark College of Engineering (now New Jersey Institute of Technology) in 1939, one of only two women in her class. During college, Hicks worked in the treasury office of an Abercrombie & Fitch store as a telephone operator, and in the university's library. After receiving her undergraduate degree, Hicks stayed at Newark College of Engineering for three years as a research assistant, where she studied the history of Edward Weston's inventions and took additional classes at night.|$|E
5|$|Ferrari {{undertook}} additional medical {{study in}} Europe and the United States, learning pioneering techniques that she {{brought back to}} Argentina. She studied urinary tract monitoring at the Medical Faculty of Paris, earning the first diploma ever given to a <b>woman.</b> <b>She</b> designed a vaginoscope, studied radiation therapy at the Curie Institute, and performed a Caesarean section at Columbia University. She was responsible for bringing these innovations back with her to Argentina and implementing them at the maternity and gynecological unit she established at the Military Hospital. An ardent feminist, she established the Argentina Federation of University Women in 1936, and pushed for recognition of both {{civil and political rights}} for women. When the government of Argentina took a conservative turn in the late 1930s, she was pushed out of the hospital and later, in the early 1950s, out of teaching. She died in 1956.|$|E
