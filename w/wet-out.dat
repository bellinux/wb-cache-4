Fibersteel rod is composed of seven pre-impregnated rods twisted into a spiral shape to act as a substitute for steel reinforcement rod in concrete;A polycarbonate matrix which had been solvent treated was tested according to Rockwell Hardness Test (ASTM 785). An 80 % glass loading was achieved by implementing a resin <b>wet-out</b> tank, which contains rollers designed to spread and submerge fibers in a polycarbonate/solvent solution. Percent of glass loading was obtained according to Ignition Test (ASTM 2584). Prototype pultrusion and pulforming equipment was designed and built at Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa;There were significant differences among all different temperature and speed combinations for the Rockwell Hardness on the polycarbonate matrix.

40|$|The present {{work was}} {{undertaken}} {{to develop a}} composite osmotic distillation (OD) membrane consisting of a thin hydrogel coating on a microporous hydrophobic substrate for the concentration of aqueous feeds containing surface-active agents. The range of OD applications using the hydrophobic membrane alone have been severely limited by the propensity for membrane <b>wet-out</b> when contacted by amphiphilic agents such as oils, fats and detergents. <b>Wet-out</b> allows the feed solution to track freely through the membrane pores with a resulting loss of solutes {{and a decrease in}} selectivity. The rationale for the approach taken was based on the hypothesis that the high water selectivity of the hydrophilic coating would maintain good water mass transfer to the underlying hydrophobic substrate but exclude other components including surface-active agents. The first stage of this work involved the identification of potential coating materials and the fabrication and structural characterization of films of these materials to determine their suitability. The second stage involved the development of techniques to facilitate adhesion of the hydrophilic coatings to the hydrophobic substrate, and the testing of the resulting composite membranes for OD performance and resistance to <b>wet-out</b> by surface-active agents. Sodium alginate was selected as the major coating component {{on the basis of its}} non-toxicity and its potential for stable hydrogel formation. Structural characterization of noncrosslinked films and films crosslinked using a water-soluble carbodiimide (WSC) was carried out using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and swelling measurements. Maximum crosslinking through esterification of hydroxyl and carboxylic acid groups on adjacent polymer strands using the film immersion method was achieved with a non-solvent (ethanol) concentration of 60 vol % and a WSC concentration of 100 mM at pH 4. These conditions resulted in a hydrogel with an equilibrium water content of 60 wt %. DSC measurements of noncrosslinked and crosslinked alginate films showed an increase in crystallinity and hence rigidity on crosslinking. Therefore, several coatings were prepared as blends of sodium alginate and amorphous highly flexible carrageenan gum in order to meet the flexibility requirements of a membrane subjected to varying operating pressures in an industrial OD plant. Structural characterization with respect to polymer blend ratio was carried out using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), DSC, X-ray diffraction (XRD). The optimisation for crosslinking conditions was undertaken as for sodium alginate alone. Optimum conditions for film preparation were 20 wt % carrageenan content and a crosslinking medium containing 60 vol % non-solvent (ethanol) and 120 mM WSC at pH 4. These conditions produced a hydrogel with an equilibrium water content of 85 wt %. Two different techniques were employed to anchor the coatings on substrate PTFE membranes. For membranes with a nominal diameter of 0. 2 µm, the technique involved surface tension adjustment of the coating solution by ethanol addition in order to enhance penetration of the coating solution meniscus into the substrate pores. This was followed by polymer precipitation by the selective removal of water using OD to provide structural interlocking. T-peel strength measurements showed that this technique resulted in a ten-fold increase in adhesion strength when compared with a coating cast without surface tension adjustments. For membranes with a nominal diameter of 0. 1 µm, an interfacial bonding agent, myristyltrimethylammonium bromide (MTMA), was used. This technique gave a three-fold increase in adhesion strength relative to that of coating cast without the use of MTMA. The composite membranes were tested in extended OD trials using pure water and feeds containing limonene, the major surface-active components of orange oil. The sodium alginate-carrageenan blend membrane, which was the preferred membrane based on flexibility and water sorption considerations, was also tested against full-cream milk and an industrial detergent, sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (DBS). The results indicated that the coatings offered little resistance to water transport and were effective in providing protection against membrane <b>wet-out.</b> Durability trials showed that the composite membranes retained their integrity in water for a minimum of 30 days. Overall, this study has expanded the potential applications of OD to include many important industrial concentration steps that are currently being undertaken by conventional processes with unsatisfactory results. These include the concentration of citrus juices, full-cream milk and nuclear power plant liquid waste. These feeds contain limonene, fats and detergents respectively, all of which wet out unprotected hydrophobic membranes...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The present work {{addresses}} the processing parameters, methodology, {{and limitations of}} {{vacuum assisted resin transfer}} molding (VARTM) of carbon fabric-reinforced thermoplastic polyamide 6 (PA 6) matrix panels on the laboratory scale. VARTM is a mature technology for producing large-scale thermoset composite parts/structures but has not been used for thermoplastic composites, which are manufactured primarily by compression molding, extrusion, and/or injection molding. In general, liquid molding of thermoplastics has limitations, such as high resin viscosity, high temperature processing requirements, and a short processing window. The materials used in this study are casting grade PA 6, "-caprolactam with a sodium-based catalyst, and an initiator. This system allows the resin to maintain a very low viscosity (< 1 Pa s) for a reasonable period of time, at relatively low temperatures (100 C). The carbon fabric preform is infused using VARTM after which the resin is fully polymerized in situ. The process developed for using VARTM to produce carbon fabric-reinforced PA 6 matrix composites is explained in detail. Microscopic studies are presented to evaluate <b>wet-out</b> of th...|$|E
40|$|Styrenic block {{copolymers}} (SBCs) are {{the base}} polymers {{for the vast}} majority of hot melt PSAs. The phase separation of the high Tg styrene blocks upon cooling allows these materials to exhibit low melt viscosity yet high adhesive shear strength. Recently, new polymerization technologies have been developed to provide acrylics with the same type of blocky structure. The hard phase is ordinarily methyl methacrylate and the soft phase is composed of low Tg monomers with lower polarity, such as butyl acrylate. These new polymers combine the traditional property advantages of acrylics (such as UV and thermo-oxidative resistance, and high moisture vapor transmission rate (MVTR)) with the processing advantages of hot melts (low capital and operating costs, and fast line speeds). Utilizing this new block acrylic technology, adhesives have been developed for medical and industrial tapes. For medical tapes, formulas with exceptional softness and fast <b>wet-out</b> have been obtained, which provide excellent skin grab and long term wear with painless removal. For industrial tapes, block acrylic formulas exhibit improved heat resistance and thermo-oxidative stability vs. those based on SBCs...|$|E
40|$|Carbon fibre {{reinforced}} polymers (CFRP) {{were introduced}} to the aerospace, automobile and civil engineering industries for their high strength and low weight. A key feature of CFRP is the polymer sizing - a coating applied {{to the surface of the}} carbon fibres to assist handling, improve the interfacial adhesion between fibre and polymer matrix and allow this matrix to <b>wet-out</b> the carbon fibres. In this paper, we introduce an alternative material to the polymer sizing, namely carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on the carbon fibres, which in addition imparts electrical and thermal functionality. High quality CNTs are grown at a high density as a result of a 35 [*]nm aluminium interlayer which has previously been shown to minimise diffusion of the catalyst in the carbon fibre substrate. A CNT modified-CFRP show 300 %, 450 % and 230 % improvements in the electrical conductivity on the ‘surface’, ‘through-thickness’ and ‘volume’ directions, respectively. Furthermore, through-thickness thermal conductivity calculations reveal a 107 % increase. These improvements suggest the potential of a direct replacement for lightning strike solutions and to enhance the efficiency of current de-icing solutions employed in the aerospace industry...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} paper we present a novel finite element method capable of {{handling}} most of the physics arising in the resin <b>wet-out</b> step for any composite system and processing case. The method {{is based on a}} compressible two-phase continuum formulation where a key feature is to model the involved physics via innovative use of the compressibility of the phases. On the one hand, the fluid phase compressibility is used to capture the physics of the advancing resin front as well as the physics behind the flow front. On the other hand, solid phase compressibility is used to model micro infiltration of the resin and the corresponding preform compaction, essentially considered as a fluid sink problem. Finally, the generic porous media model is formulated in the finite strain regime. The model has been implemented and demonstrated for different manufacturing methods and the results with respect to each example is presented. The degree of saturation, pressure distribution, preform deformation and reaction forces are some of the post-processed results for different manufacturing methods. The ultimate goal of this contribution is to establish an unified generic and general simulation tool for structural (long fiber) composite processing where, to this date, there is no single FE based tool available commercially for this purpose...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{thermoplastic}} composites {{based on}} poly(lactic) acid and phosphate glass fibres over metallic alloys for clinical restorative treatment is highly beneficial {{due to their}} biocompatibility and biodegradability. However, difficulties in achieving a thorough melt impregnation at high fibre contents while limiting polymer degradation {{is one of the}} main issues encountered during their manufacture. This paper reports for the first time on the effects of pressure cycling on the mechanical properties of compression moulded polylactic acid-phosphate glass fibre composites. The strength of the composites consolidated under pressure cycling were at least 30 % higher than those in which conventional static pressure was used. The marked disparity was attributed to the influence of pressure cycling on the fibre preform permeability, the melt viscosity and the capillary pressure, leading to improved fibre <b>wet-out</b> with respect to static pressure. Implementation of a cyclic pressure appeared to promote the occurrence of transcrystallinity in the polymer matrix as suggested by DSC traces. The fibre content influenced PLA thermal degradation since the matrix molecular weight decreased as the fibre content increased on account of the moisture adsorbed by the glass surface. However, this extent of degradation did not impair the matrix mechanical performance in the composites...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{properties of the}} glass fiber reinforced Polyamide (PA 6) composites made by prepreg tapes and commingled yarns were studied by in-plane compression, short-beam shear, and flexural tests. The composites were fabricated with different fiber volume contents (prepregs— 47 %, 55 %, 60 %, and commingled— 48 %, 48 %, 49 %, respectively) by using vacuum consolidation technique. To evaluate laminate quality in terms of fiber <b>wet-out</b> at filament level, homogeneity of fiber/matrix distribution, and matrix/fiber bonding standard microscopic methods like optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used. Both commingled and prepreg glass fiber/PA 6 composites (with Vf ? 48 %) give {{mechanical properties}} such as compression strength (530 – 570 MPa), inter-laminar shear strength (70 – 80 MPa), and transverse strength (80 – 90 MPa). By increasing small percentage in the fiber content show significant rise in compression strength, slight decrease in the ILSS and transverse strengths, whereas semipreg give very poor properties with the slight increase in fiber content. Overall comparison of mechanical properties indicates commingled glass fiber/PA 6 composite shows much better performance compared with prepregs due to uniform distribution of fiber and matrix, better melt-impregnation while processing, perfect alignment of glass fibers in the composite.

The No. 1 acknowledged challenge of constructing an OTEC plant is the Cold Water Pipe (CWP), which draws cold water from 1000 m depths up to the surface, {{to serve as the}} coolant for the OTEC Rankine cycle. For a commercial-scale plant, the CWP is on the order of 10 m in diameter. This report describes work done by LMSSC developing the CWP for LM MS 2 New Ventures emerging OTEC business. The work started in early 2008 deciding on the minimum-cost CWP architecture, materials, and fabrication process. In order to eliminate what in previous OTEC work had been a very large assembly/deployment risk, we took the innovative approach of building an integral CWP directly from theOTEC platform and down into the water. During the latter half of 2008, we proceeded to a successful small-scale Proof-of-Principles validation of the new fabrication process, at the Engineering Development Lab in Sunnyvale.

However, silicone elastomers will eventually <b>wet-out</b> leading to leakage current and dry-band arcing giving rise to erosion of the silicone housing material, and eventually insulation failure. Well-established formulations of insulation housing composites have been developed and validated for erosion performance using the standard inclined plane tracking and erosion test, yet no such formulations have been developed and validated for DC. With the assumption that equivalent performance will be obtained, an adjustment to the creepage distance has been the measure taken in using the AC insulators for DC, without taking into consideration the differing aspects of the DC {{as compared to the}} AC dry-band arcing. This practice questions the existing DC insulators as an unknown entity that requires further investigation to ensure the reliability of the power supply. In addition recent demands have been raised to develop housing composites specifically for DC outdoor insulation, particularly with the increased interest in DC. It follows that developing a standard DC inclined plane tracking and erosion test is necessary for the development of more suitable materials for outdoor DC insulation applications. This thesis provides a thorough study of the DC dry-band arcing mechanism as opposed to the well understood mechanism of the AC dry-band arcing and provides a mechanistic understanding to the dry-band arcing leading to erosion as a foundation {{for the development of a}} standard DC inclined plane tracking and erosion test. To this end, the influence of inorganic fillers in silicone rubber on resisting erosion due to dry-band arcing is also presented, as an essential step towards obtaining more suitable silicone composite for DC outdoor insulation applications...|$|E
40|$|A {{continued}} {{desire for}} increased mobility {{in the aftermath}} of natural disasters, or on the battlefield, has lead to the need for improved light-weight bridging solutions. This research investigates the development of a carbon/ epoxy composite bridging system to meet the needs for light-weight bridging. The research focuses on two main topics. The first topic is that of processing composite structures and the second is the design and testing of these structures. In recent years the Vacuum Assisted Resin Transfer Molding (VARTM) process has become recognized as a low-cost manufacturing alternative for large Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) composite structures for civil, military, and aerospace applications. The success of the VARTM process (complete <b>wet-out)</b> is very sensitive to the resin injection strategy used and the proper placement of flow distribution materials and inlet and vacuum ports. Predicting the flow front pattern, the time required for infusing a part with resin, and the time required to bleed excess resin at the end of filling, is critical to ensure that the part will become completely impregnated and desired fiber volume fractions achieved prior to the resin gelling (initiation of cure). In order to eliminate costly trial and error experiments to determine the optimal infusion strategy, this research presents a simulation model which considers in-plane flow as well as flow through the thickness of the preform. In addition to resin filling, the current model is able to simulate the bleeding of resin at the end of filling to predict the required bleeding time to reach desired fiber volume fractions for the final part. In addition to processing, the second portion of the dissertation investigates the design and testing of composite bridge deck sections which also serve as short-span bridging for gaps up to 4 m in length. The research focuses on the design of a light-weight core material for bridge decking as well as proof loading of short-span bridge sections in the lab and extensive field testing using a variety of wheeled and tracked vehicles at different crossing speeds and crossing condition...|$|E
40|$|Fiber-reinforced {{plastics}} are hybrid materials {{designed for}} the needs of the 21 st century. With their capability to form low weight structures, while preserving high stiffness and excellent damping, these composites provide solutions for a broad range of markets. Unfortunately, some of these advantages are not used in practice because there exist no fast and automated manufacturing processes for efficient production. In the research field of continuous-reinforced thermoplastic composites, industry is facing a challenge of high viscose polymer melt and thereby an imperfect fiber <b>wet-out.</b> As a result, synergy effects of fibers within a polymer could not be fully exploited. The topic of this work is to adapt new processing technologies for reactive thermoplastic polymers. On one hand, fast heating and cooling options offer processes with shorter cycle time, and on the other hand, low viscosity of reactive polymers impregnates the textile structures faster. This results in faster and cheaper manufacturing of composites that are yet to be realized for the market. All FRPCs were produced on a continuous compression molding press. As a noncontinuous technology, an inductive heated CageSystem® from RocTool has been selected. Entropically driven ring-opening cyclic oligomers form Cyclics with waterlike melt viscosities are chosen as reactive matrix. The viscosity of Cyclic Butylene Terephthalate (CBT*) was measured using a rheometer. The rheological behavior is determined under isothermal conditions for various temperatures. The chemical transformation from oligomer to macromolecule pCBT 1 was assessed by size exclusion chromatography. Based on these studies, a kinetic polymerization model was constructed which involved an Arrhenius-type equation. By using the activation energy and pre-exponential factor, it was possible to offer an exact mathematical solution for the prediction of isothermal conversion. A numerical solution of the Arrhenius equation helped to predict the polymerization for any timetemperature conditions. Furthermore, the polymerization model was extended to describe the chemo-rheology. Inserting specific material parameters, the bipartite model was able to provide a numerical prognosis for the viscosity with the input parameters time-temperature. All models were calibrated and validated with the experimental data. The continuous compression molding press was used to consolidate CBT-prepregs and PBT-prepregs. As reinforcing phase, a multiaxial non-crimp-fabric from Ahlstrom was used. This fabric contained glass fibers with a “CBT*-compatible” sizing. The design of experiments was mainly focusing on the variation in the temperature distribution in process direction with respect to process speeds. An extensive analysis, from optical to energy absorption, was performed on the resulting FRPC-product, called organic sheet. All test results showed a better performance for GF-pCBT compared to GF-PBT. Even for much higher process speed, the material properties of GF-pCBT did not deteriorate strongly in contrast to GF-PBT. The enhancement was traced to a better fiber-matrix interface (e. g., ILSS values) and to an excellent fiber <b>wet-out</b> with pCBT (e. g., SEM pictures). Viscosity and impregnation are the main factors behind the transversal visco-elastic impregnation model that was deduced. An arithmetic function that tracks the impregnation process for the classical thermoplastic PBT and its reactive pendant CBT* was derived. This was based on the dimensionless B-factor which was considered as technology independent performance indicator. The model was able to link the fast impregnation with CBT* - the viscosity of which is 10 - 5 magnitude lower than PBT - to all temperature-time-conditions. An optimization method was used to find process parameters to realize a minimum cycle time for the continuous process. This model was adapted to the non-continuous pressing technology to find the minimum cycle time. To evaluate the economic potential, a transparent process analysis was set up in form of a static cost calculation. In a first step, all monetary activities from each technology were identified and rated. The cycle time - as main capacity indicator - was based on the chemo-rheological model introduced above. Different break-even analyses and production costs highlighted the techno-economic potential of the related process-material-combination. A synergistic effect between innovative process technologies and reactive thermoplastic polymer was found. Faster and more efficient technologies for the production of fiber-reinforced plastics have been systematically developed and evaluated. The results were achieved with an intelligent combination of manufacturing technology and modern reactive thermoplastic polymers. Moreover, the approach of this work can be transferred to the other reactive thermoplastic matrix-based composites...|$|E

Initial studies were undertaken to determine {{the location of the}} constituent species present in the size to produce an image of its structure. The film-former formulation was then altered to produce a range of physical properties. The performance of sizes produced from these film-formers were then investigated in the areas of clarity, film formation, wetting ability and strength. Alterations to the size formulation was then undertaken to determine whether this produced any effect in the performance of the size over some of the same areas of investigation. The conclusions drawn are listed below:• The coupling agent species present in the size formulation migrates to the glass interface of the size during drying. • A minor amount of lubricant migrates to the air interface of the size during drying. • Migration of species in the size only occurs during drying when the size is in its liquid state. • The molecular weight and particle size of a film-former {{is directly related to the}} initiator and first stage monomer concentrations respectively. • The molecular weight of a film-former does not alter the size's ability to form a continuous film if dried under suitable conditions. Film-formers with large particle sizes produce inhomogeneous films due to incomplete diffusion occurring during film formation. • The inhomogeneity of films with larger particle sizes present produces an increasingly optically active film with an increased <b>wet-out</b> rate. • The molecular weight and particle size of a film-former do not alter the corresponding sizes ability to wet a bare glass fibre due to the large amount of water present in the size formulation. • A size can be redistributed following successive re-wetting and drying under certain conditions. •The stiffness of a size is directly related to the molecular weight of the sizes film-former. • An inhomogeneous, discontinuous size will be formed with excessive deviation from the size formulation. • An excess of coupling agent is present in the standard size formulation...|$|E
40|$|Hybrid organic-inorganic {{coatings}} impart desirable {{properties to}} textiles, but can adversely affect properties such as bending rigidity and extensibility. This study {{aimed to develop}} effective organo-silicate coatings for wool textiles. Formulations based on silanes with contrasting properties were applied to fabrics by padding and to single fibres and rovings by dip coating, and examined by microscopy. The bending rigidities and water repellencies of fabrics, and the tensile properties of rovings were determined. The silanes used were methyltriethoxysilane (MTES) and (3 -glycidoxypropyl) trimethoxysilane (GLYMO). Methylimidazole (MI) was used to catalyse the reaction between the epoxy groups of GLYMO and the amine groups of wool. MTES coatings of up to 3. 0 % solids on mass of wool {{could be applied to}} woven fabric without causing unacceptable stiffness. MTES coatings of as little as 0. 3 % solids on mass of wool imparted water repellency. The water repellency was increased by adding hydrophobic compounds to the formulation. Hydrophilic GLYMO-MI formulations gave greater wetting and coverage of dip coated single fibres than MTES formulations, due to the greater reactivity of the fibre surface towards GLYMO, and the flocculation of hydrophobic MTES during drying. On roving, inter-fibre bonding masked the differences between MTES and GLYMO-MI coatings observed in single fibre studies. At low levels (&# 61603; 0. 05 % by mass of formulation solids), a non-ionic surfactant improved the ability of GLYMO-MI coatings to <b>wet-out</b> wool, while at higher levels it caused flocculation. The surfactant had an inconsistent effect on MTES coatings. Increasing the critical surface tension of wool by chlorination, lowered the minimum GLYMO-MI solids level needed for continuous coating from 4. 0 % to 3. 0 %. In contrast, chlorination gave only small improvements to MTES coatings. The surface of wool accommodates extension by the separation of cuticle scales. Continuous coatings hinder this separation and crack at the scale junctions. It has been shown that these undesirable effects are avoided with discontinuous coatings, such those produced by MTES formulations. This work has shown that organo-silicate coatings can be tailored by choice of silane precursors, addition of surfactant, controlling reactivity between coating and wool, and modifying wool's surface energy, to effectively coat wool textiles...|$|E

Their field of application spreads from the aerospace up to automotive and general industry sector. Typical examples of components made of unidirectional reinforced composite materials are rocket motor cases, drive shafts or pressure vessels for hydrogen storage. The filament winding technology, the pultrusion process and the tape placement are processes suitable for the manufacturing using UD semi-finished products. The demand for parts made of UD composites is constantly increasing over the last years. A key feature for the success of this technology is the improvement of the manufacturing procedure. Impregnation {{is one of the most}} important steps in the manufacturing process. During this step the dry continuous fibers are combined with the liquid matrix in order to create a fully impregnated semi-finished product. The properties of the impregnated roving have a major effect on the laminate quality, and the efficient processing of the liquid matrix has a big influence on the manufacturing costs. The present work is related to the development of a new method for the impregnation of carbon fiber rovings with thermoset resin. The developed impregnation unit consists of a sinusoidal cavity without any moving parts. The unit in combination with an automated resin mixing-dosing system allows complete <b>wet-out</b> of the fibers, precise calibration of the resin fraction, and stable processing conditions. The thesis focuses on the modeling of the impregnation process. Mathematical expressions for the fiber compaction, the gradual increase of the roving tension, the static pressure, the capillarity inside the filaments of the roving, and the fiber permeation are presented, discussed, and experimentally verified. These expressions were implemented in a modeling algorithm. The model takes into account all the relevant material and process parameters. An experimental set-up based on the filament winding process was used for the validation of the model. Trials under different conditions have been performed. The results proved that the model can accurately simulate the impregnation process. The good impregnation degree of the wound samples confirmed the efficiency of the developed impregnation unit.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{interest}} {{has grown in}} the use of composite components within the automotive industry. Fibre reinforced plastic (FRP) components are of particular interest to the industry, since lower tooling costs and part consolidation can be utilised, whilst lighter, stiffer components can be produced. Several methods are available to produce FRP components at high volumes, including compression moulding (using dough and sheet moulding compounds), reinforced reaction injection moulding (RRIM) and liquid moulding processes (resin transfer moulding (RTM) and structural reaction injection moulding (SRIM)). RTM is a closed mould process, which is widely used to produce components economically in low volumes using matched moulds to produce two good surfaces. The absence of a high volume manufacturing technology, however, has impeded the acceptance and advance of RTM within the automotive industry. A research programme was established at the University of Nottingham to address the problems {{associated with the use of}} RTM for high volume manufacture. This programme has considered the topics of process technology, processing characteristics of polyester resin systems and fibre preforms, fibre <b>wet-out</b> and interfacial bonding, mould design, microwave pre-heating of reactive resin systems and process modelling. This thesis concerns the research which was undertaken to identify the causes of void formation during the impregnation and polymerisation stages of RTM, and methods of reducing the final void content within the component. The impregnation phase of the RTM process was identified as being the stage where the majority of voids were formed. A study of oil impregnation (having a similar viscosity to that of resin) into reinforcement was undertaken to determine the reasons for uneven flow and air entrapment. The dry reinforcements were studied to assess the microstructure of the preforms in order to determine reasons for obstruction of the resin flow. Fabric stitching, thermoplastic binder and size deposits were identified as potential causes of flow impediment. Fibre orientation and preform stacking were also assumed to assist in the development of uneven flow, leading to air entrapment. A major factor determining the formation of microvoids within fibre bundles was identified as the transverse impregnation of resin into high Tex fibre bundles. The major moulding process variables of injection pressure, vent pressure, fibre volume fraction, mould temperature and resin pre-heating have been assessed, to determine their effect on the void content within unidirectional and CFRM reinforced polyester laminates. It was observed that vacuum assistance during impregnation reduced void formation, although higher exotherm pressures and the possibility of monomer boiling arise from its use. A simple impregnation model was developed to assess the microscopic impregnation rates between fibre bundles, in the capillary between fibres and transversely into fibre bundles. The results from this model were compared with actual moulding histories. The findings of the overall work are discussed and suggestions proposed for the reduction of void content in RTM automotive components...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} to {{investigate}} theory and application of Osmotic Distillation (OD). OD is a new novel membrane separation process used for the concentration of aqueous solutions such as fruit juices without the application of heat. The present work was undertaken to investigate flux limitations focusing on feedside, membrane and stripper side characteristics of OD. Once the limiting areas were identified, further studies were undertaken to determine methods of minimizing those limitations without losing the quality and integrity of the liquid feed. A laboratory scale OD system was used to simulate the industrial process which takes place during the production of grape juice concentrate for the fruit juice industry. Results of a UF pretreatment study showed that the use of UF membranes with pore diameters of 0. 1 fÝm or less as a pretreatment for the subsequent OD of grape juice resulted in significant increases in OD flux over that observed for juice not subjected to UF. The study of the physical properties of the feed {{played an important role in}} the explanation of the OD process. The increase in OD flux was attributed to a reduction in juice viscosity as the result of the removal of protein and other high molecular weight components. Apart from an increase in OD flux, UF pretreatment of the grape juice proved to be beneficial in other areas of the OD process. HPLC measurements showed that the normal concentration of fermentable sugars in standard 68 oBrix concentrate can be achieved at a lower Brix value in feed subjected to UF pretreatment, further reducing the need to handle highly viscous feeds. UF pretreatment also resulted in an increase in juice surface tension consequently reducing the tendency for membrane <b>wet-out</b> to occur. The study of the deoxygenation of the feed solution shows that the removal of dissolved gases by the pre boiling method and the perstraction with chemical reaction (PCR) method both had a positive affect on OD flux. Pre boiling the brine resulted in an indirect reduction in dissolved oxygen in the feed. Pre boiling both the feed and brine, further increased the flux. Throughout the PCR study, it was evident that stripper side mass transfer of O 2 was not limited by flowrate but was limited by higher stripper concentration. However, the latter had an insignificant effect when the sulfite-oxygen reaction was catalysed. The use of a catalyst and increase in temperature gave a significant improvement in overall mass transfer coefficient. Ten types of hydrophobic microporous membranes were tested for their influence on OD flux. While the pore diameter is a considerable factor in mass transport of gases through the membrane, it was also noted that the type of membrane material used had an affect on the overall mass transfer. All top three performing membranes had pore diameters of 0. 2 x 10 - 6 m and were made from polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). The choice of brine to use as the stripper was based on criteria that were confirmed by the brine studies performed here. The best performing stripper solutions demonstrating the greatest improvement in OD flux over the most commonly used brines, NaCl, CaCl 2 and CH 3 COOK were aqueous solutions of potassium salts of phosphoric acid, pyrophosphoric acid and blends thereof. These salts agreed with all the required characteristics of a suitable brine, demonstrating high solubility rates, supporting the ability to lower water vapour pressure. The study of the corrosion effects of brine salts confirmed the phosphate salts are superior demonstrating some of the lowest corrosion rates and highest pH...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, natural fibre-reinforced polymer {{composites}} {{have been}} attracting {{attention from the}} viewpoint of reducing the impact on the natural environment. Currently, the use of thermoplastic resins in composites is clearly of higher potential than the use of thermoset. There are many thermoplastic polymers derived from renewable raw materials, which are also biodegradable. Polylactic acid (PLA) is one such candidate, and it shows rather good properties that are suitable for applications that do not require long-term durability or elevated mechanical performance at higher temperatures. In order to make their possible use in many technical applications more attractive, the mechanical properties of the PLA can be enhanced by using reinforcements. Hemp fibres can be considered to be a good choice for reinforcing polymer composites, due to their high stiffness, strength, and aspect ratio. Highly ordered textile reinforcements, such as interlaced woven fabrics and unidirectional fabrics made from natural-fibre yarns, perform considerably better than random non-woven mats in natural-fibre composites. At present, the commercially available plant-fibre yarns are not intended for structural composites, but for textiles, which have entirely different demands on the yarns. Thus, work is needed to tailor-make the best plant-fibre yarn for reinforcement of composites. This also includes investigation of the possibility of combining plant-fibre yarns with the matrix polymer in fibre form into one hybrid yarn (a composite preform), and how to do it (twisting or blending). It is well known that fibres provide the highest strength and stiffness when they are continuous and aligned {{in the direction of the}} applied load. Natural fibres are naturally discontinuous and conventional spun staple yarns tend to be highly twisted, which leads to fibre misalignment and poor resin <b>wet-out.</b> The structured natural-fibre composites reported so far are based on twisted yarns produced by long-established conventional spinning methods, mainly ring spinning. In this paper, we report our work on improving the orientation of hemp fibres in composites by using our recent development of co-wrapped yarn structures. This novel co-wrapped yarn consists of low twist and very fine hemp yarns next to PLA filaments in the core part, which are wrapped by PLA filaments. By varying the composition of hybrid yarn, it is possible to vary the hemp fibre content from 10 to 45 wt %. An exciting recent advancement has been a new family of aligned natural-fibre reinforcements, which has overcome these issues by using low twist yarns. We also report the influence of fibre content and wrap density (number of wraps per unit length) on the properties of composites. Before compression moulding, multilayer 0 / 90 bidirectional hybrid yarn prepregs were prepared by winding the hybrid yarn around a steel rectangular frame. We investigated the mechanical and thermo-mechanical properties of hemp-reinforced PLA composites. Compared to neat PLA, the tensile and flexural modulus and the strength of the PLA-hemp composites were significantly higher as a result of the increased fibre content. Impact strength of the composites decreased initially up to 10 wt % fibre loading, but even higher fibre loading caused an improvement in impact strength. From the DMTA results, it is evident that incorporation of the fibres gives a considerable increase in storage modulus and a decrease in tan δ values. These results show the reinforcing effect of hemp on PLA matrix. From the general trend in the results obtained, it can be affirmed that co-wrapped hybrid yarn with lower wrapping density leads to lower mechanical properties in the composite. The study performed with DSC revealed that the glass transition temperature and the crystalline melting point of PLA were not affected significantly after reinforcement with hemp. The crystallisation temperature of the hemp-reinforced PLA composites decreased compared to pure PLA, which indicates that the hemp fibres hinder the migration and diffusion of PLA molecular chains to the surface of the nucleus in the composites. No noteworthy differences in calorimetric data from DSC for composites were observed between the hybrid yarn preforms with different wrapping density. Future work will concentrate on efforts to evaluate the biodegradability of these developing and promising composites...|$|E
