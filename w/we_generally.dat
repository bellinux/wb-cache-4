25|$|All {{models are}} {{simplified}} abstractions of the real-life situation. There exists a basic tradeoff between model precision and parameter precision. A fixed {{amount of information}} collected, will, if split amongst the many parameters of an overly precise model, result {{in at least some}} of the parameters being represented by inadequate sample sizes. Because of the often limited quantities and limited precision of data from which to calculate parameters values in non-human behavior studies, such models should generally be kept simple. Therefore, <b>we</b> <b>generally</b> should not expect models for social insect task allocation or task partitioning to be as elaborate as human workflow ones, for example.|$|E
25|$|The central {{uncovered}} {{area in a}} Roman domus {{was referred}} to as an atrium. Today, <b>we</b> <b>generally</b> use the term courtyard to refer to such an area, reserving the word atrium to describe a glass-covered courtyard. Roman atrium houses were built side by side along the street. They were one-storey homes without windows that took in light from the entrance and from the central atrium. The hearth, which used to inhabit the centre of the home, was relocated, and the Roman atrium most often contained a central pool used to collect rainwater, called an impluvium. These homes frequently incorporated a second open-air area, the garden, which would be surrounded by Greek-style colonnades, forming a peristyle. This created a colonnaded walkway {{around the perimeter of the}} courtyard, which influenced monastic structures centuries later.|$|E

2500|$|Coleman and Brown {{returned}} {{to the home of}} Reverend and Mrs. Gay in Dayton. Reverend Gay recognized Coleman, who at this time {{was the subject of a}} huge nationwide manhunt, and Coleman accosted Millard and Kathryn with guns. Reverend Gay asked Coleman, [...] "Why you want to do us like that, like this?", and according to Gay, Coleman responded: [...] "I'm not going to kill you, but <b>we</b> <b>generally</b> kill them where we go." [...] Coleman and Brown took their car and headed back toward Evanston, Illinois. Along the way, they stole another car in Indianapolis and killed its owner, 75-year-old Eugene Scott.|$|E
2500|$|I wouldn't say we're {{overwhelming}} favourites but I think <b>we</b> <b>generally</b> {{start as}} favourites against most teams at home. Touring teams often take {{a bit of}} time to adapt to our conditions and I think we saw a bit of that in the way Sri Lanka began the most recent series. The Windies haven't played any one-day cricket for a while and we're in the middle of our season, so I suppose we are the team to beat. But having said that, if they find their feet they're a very good side and we'll have to play very well to win." ...|$|E

They always show some photographs with Nanjing refugees selling some food in the streets or Chinese people smiling in the camps. They are forgetting about Japanese propaganda. The Imperial Army imposed strict censorship. Any photographs with dead bodies couldn't get through. So photographers had to remove all the bodies before taking pictures of streets and buildings in the city (...) Even if the photos were not staged, the refugees {{had no choice but}} to fawn on the Japanese soldiers. Acting otherwise meant their deaths..." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{previous}} version, {{according to}} Fielding, was criticised as [...] "a Burlesque on the loftiest Parts of Tragedy, {{and designed to}} banish what <b>we</b> <b>generally</b> call Fine Things, from the Stage." [...] This idea is developed by {{the focus of the}} tragedy being on a low-class citizen of the kingdom, even smaller in stature than a regular commoner. Tragedies normally deal with royalty and high-class families, so the focus on little Tom Thumb establishes the satirical nature from the beginning. In addition, the over the top nature of the plot, the intricacies of the characters' relationships, and the littering of bodies {{at the end of the}} play all serve to further mock and burlesque eighteenth century tragedies. The burlesque aspects posed a problem for Fielding, and people saw his show more for pleasure than for its biting satire. In altering his ending to having the ghost of Tom's father die instead of Tom's ghost, Fielding sought to remove part of the elements that provoked humour to bolster the satiric purpose of the play.|$|E
