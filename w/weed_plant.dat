Through analysis of the results, it can be concluded that a high percentage of <b>weed</b> <b>plants</b> (> 85 % related to the highest registered value) was obtained with more than 90 mm of accumulated rainfall from the beginning of September. Thus, in those years in which this amount of rainfall (90 mm) is registered until the end of October, the appearance of potential <b>weed</b> <b>plants</b> can be ensured, under Mediterranean conditions, in a period before sowing the autumn-winter crops...|$|R

Two sites of the same pasture were evaluated, one site located close (0. 5 m) to the main stalk of the weed and the other located at a distance where no weed was growing within a radius of 2. 0 m. The number, weight and morphology of the tillers were evaluated in a completely randomized design with three repetitions. At the site distant from the weed, a higher population density of defoliated tillers without apical meristem was observed. The number of basal and aerial tillers was smaller close to the <b>weed</b> <b>plant.</b> This site was also characterized by smaller numbers of vegetative, reproductive, live, dead and total tillers when compared to the site distant from the <b>weed</b> <b>plant.</b> The weight of vegetative and reproductive tillers was higher at the site close to the <b>weed</b> <b>plant.</b> Tillers close to the <b>weed</b> <b>plant</b> exhibited a greater length of the pseudostem and leaf blade, a larger number of live leaves, and fewer grazed leaves compared to distant tillers.

Rhamphicarpa fistulosa infestation, therefore, may influence the competitive balance between rice and its weeds and shape weed community structure.

This <b>weed</b> <b>plant</b> has received attention for its natural ability to significantly accumulate the poly-unsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) stearidonic acid (SDA, C 18 : 4 n- 3) in its seeds, which is uncommon for most plant species.

Abundance of these gene transcripts was analyzed across different tissues and growth regimes. Two of the most widely used algorithms, geNorm and NormFinder, showed variation in expression levels of these RGs.
