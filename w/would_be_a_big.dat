25|$|On September 30, 1995 Damascus opened {{contacts}} with high ranking German CDU MP Heinrich Lummer and intelligence officials in Damascus. The CDU demanded PKK end all its activities in Germany. The PKK demanded {{that it should}} be recognized as a legitimate entity and not as a terrorist organization. The PKK had been banned in Germany in 1993. If the PKK's demand had passed, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> step for Damascus, not just for the water issues and Hatay demands, but also because a Western country was negotiating with a banned organization. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> blow to Turkey as the inability to stop terrorism in the country could end with balkanization of the region.|$|E

Soon afterward, Jericho repeatedly called out World Heavyweight Champion Goldberg, {{in an attempt to}} begin a feud with him, but never actually wrestled him. Jericho cites Eric Bischoff, Goldberg, and Hulk Hogan's refusal to book Jericho in a pay-per-view squash match loss against Goldberg, which Jericho felt <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> draw, as a major reason for leaving the company.|$|E
25|$|The Wilkinson brothers' {{first season}} at Iowa was in 1944–45. They joined {{incoming}} freshman star Murray Wier and three solid sophomores—Dick Ives, Jack Spencer and Dave Danner—in what <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>Big</b> Ten Conference-winning season. The Hawkeyes finished 17–1 overall (11–1 in conference play) and their only loss came to Illinois by one point. Herb averaged 9.6points per game (ppg) while Clay, a junior, averaged 11.5ppg as the team's starting center. Despite Clay's slightly better numbers, Herb was honored as a consensus Second Team All-American along with fellow sophomore teammate Ives. It was Herb's ball-handling, leadership, {{and ability to}} score long-range shots that would deflate opponents' morale that played a large part in his selection. That year's team {{was also the first}} in school history to win an outright Big Ten championship.|$|E

25|$|However, the 1988–89 season <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> {{turning point}} for the franchise. In 1987, coin {{collector}} Bruce McNall purchased the Kings from Buss and turned the team into a Stanley Cup contender almost overnight. On August 9, 1988, McNall acquired the league's best player, Wayne Gretzky, in a blockbuster trade with the Edmonton Oilers. The trade rocked the hockey world, especially {{north of the border}} where Canadians mourned the loss of a player they considered a national treasure. McNall changed the team colors to silver and black. Gretzky's arrival generated much excitement about hockey and the NHL in Southern California, and the ensuing popularity of the Kings is credited with the arrival of another team in the region, the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim (later renamed to Anaheim Ducks in 2006), and the NHL's expanding or moving into other Sun Belt cities such as Dallas, Phoenix, Tampa, Miami and Nashville.|$|E
25|$|Vivian Vance {{became a}} {{consideration}} {{on the recommendation}} of Lucy director Marc Daniels. Daniels had worked with Vance in New York on Broadway in the early 1940s. Vance had already been a successful stage star performing on Broadway for nearly 20 years in a variety of plays, and in addition, after relocating to Hollywood in the late 1940s, had two film roles to her credit. Nonetheless, by 1951, she was still a relatively unknown actress in Hollywood. Vance was performing in a revival of the play The Voice of the Turtle in La Jolla, California. Arnaz and Jess Oppenheimer went to see her in the play and hired her on the spot. Vance was reluctant about giving up her film and stage work for a television show, yet was convinced by Daniels that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> break in her career. Ball, however, had many misgivings about hiring Vance, who was younger and far more attractive than the concept of Ethel as an older, somewhat homely woman. Ball was also a believer in the Hollywood adage at the time that there should be only one pretty woman on the set and Ball, being the star of the show, was it. Arnaz, however, was impressed by Vance's work and hired her. The decision was then made to dress Vance in frumpier clothing to tone down her attractiveness. Ball and Vance's relationship during the series' early beginnings were lukewarm at best. Eventually realizing that Vance was no threat and was very professional, Ball began to warm to her. In 1954, Vance would become the first actress to win an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress. Vance and Ball would develop a lifelong close friendship. Ball would go on to ask Vance to co-star in Ball's new series The Lucy Show after the end of I Love Lucy.|$|E

Upon its release, IGN labeled it as an [...] "Editor's Choice" [...] and awarded it [...] "Game of the Month" [...] for the Nintendo DS, citing the game as a [...] "great achievement" [...] of the system's capability. In 2005, the game won a Golden Joystick Award for best handheld game of year. Prior to the game's release, Craig Harris of IGN reviewed the early demonstration. He commented on the accurate recreation of the original graphics, and stated that the small Nintendo DS screen helps hide any visual flaws. Harris criticized the game's controls calling them a little [...] "sluggish" [...] and [...] "clumsy". Though he praised the graphics and new gameplay additions, Harris expressed disappointment that the Mario launch title for the new system was a remake instead of a full game. IGN's Anoop Gantayat anticipated the game <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> hit among American video game enthusiasts. In Japan, Famitsu ranked Super Mario 64 DS the 29th most wanted title.|$|E
500|$|The South Vietnamese {{eventually}} {{had their}} way. As the generals and Hương {{were unwilling to}} reinstate the HNC, Taylor sent General John L. Throckmorton to meet them and mend relations. Throckmorton told the Vietnamese generals they had read too much into Taylor's comments and that the US {{had no intention of}} pressuring them out of power with aid cuts. Cang appeared unimpressed, while Thiệu and Kỳ made indirect and vague comments about what they perceived to be misleading tactics during the talks. Khánh appeared reassured by Throckmorton's overtures and made a public statement on December 30, saying he was not as hostile to the Americans as reported, and he wanted Thiệu and Cang to meet the Americans to relieve any remaining tension. He also claimed privately that the statements attributed to him by Deepe were false and set up a bilateral committee to discuss tensions. The generals eventually won out, as the Americans did not move against them in any way for their refusal to reinstate the HNC. The South Vietnamese won in large part because the Americans had spent so much on the country, and could not afford to abandon it and lose to the communists over the matter of military rule, as a communist takeover <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> public relations coup for the Soviet bloc.
