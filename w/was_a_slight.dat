5|$|The ethnic {{diversity}} of the American AG is increasing; however, its constituency is still largely white. From 1990 to 2000, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> decline in white AG churches while ethnic churches, mainly Hispanic, were responsible {{for much of the}} denomination's numerical growth. In 2010, the AG reported 61.1 percent of its adherents as white, 20.4 percent as Hispanic, 9.1 percent as black, 4.1 percent as Asian/Pacific Islander, and 1.6 percent as Native American. The remaining 3.7 percent were listed as other/mixed.|$|E
5|$|In July and August, Carlsen won the Biel Grandmaster Tournament with a 6/10 {{record and}} a PR of 2753. His score was matched by Alexander Onischuk and they played a match to break the tie. After drawing two rapid and two blitz games, Carlsen won the armageddon game. Immediately after the Biel tournament, Carlsen entered the open Arctic Chess Challenge in Tromsø, but his fourth-place result with +5=4 <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> {{underperformance}} in terms of rating. In the first round, Carlsen conceded a draw to his classmate Brede Hagen (rated 2034) after having a lost position at one point. A game which attracted some attention was his sixth-round win over his father, Henrik Carlsen.|$|E

Additional {{sets were}} {{required for the}} scenes at the Xindi Council, while the sets for Degra's ship had been created for an earlier episode. Although most scenes were filmed between February 12 and 23, the scenes featuring the Sphere-Builders were filmed {{in conjunction with the}} following episode on February 26. Two reviewers praised the episode, and it was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Visual Effects.

The episode was released on DVD on October 28, 2002 in Region 2, and December 9, 2003 in Region 1.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Kristy in 2006 was a {{relatively}} long-lived tropical cyclone in the 2006 Pacific hurricane season. It developed on August30 from a tropical wave off the southwest coast of Mexico, and quickly intensified to attain hurricane status, reaching peak winds of 80mph (130km/h). Subsequently, Kristy weakened from cooler waters and increased wind shear from Hurricane John to its northeast. Steering currents weakened, and turning to a southerly drift, it weakened to a tropical depression by September2. The next day it briefly regained tropical storm status, only to again deteriorate to depression status. After turning to the west, Kristy encountered marginally favorable conditions and attained tropical storm status for a third time, though unfavorable conditions caused it to dissipate on September9. The storm never affected land, although initially there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> threat to Clarion Island. Within the National Hurricane Center area of warning responsibility east of 140°W, Hurricane Kristy was the longest-lasting tropical cyclone of the season.|$|E

5|$|In 1926, {{a boxing}} venue was opened in a {{military}} facility known as Cuartel de Ballajá; a fight card was organized weekly. Legislator Lorenzo Coballes Gandía redacted a proposal to legalize boxing, which was signed by governor Horace Mann Towner in May 1927. Consequently, the Primera Comisión Atlética de Boxeo (The First Athletic Boxing Commission) was created; this became the first organization dedicated to sanctioned boxing in Puerto Rico. Estadio Universal (Universal Stadium) became the first venue to organize legal boxing cards. The first event featured a fight between Enrique Chaffardet and Al Clemens as the main event, which was declared a draw by the judges. New stadiums were built in Bayamón, Caguas, Mayagüez, Ponce, Aguadilla and San Juan. The first Puerto Rican to win a world championship was Sixto Escobar, who won it on June 26, 1934. During the 1960s and 1970s, {{there was an increase}} in the number of pugilists who achieved this recognition. Including Wilfred Benítez who on March 6, 1976, became the youngest world champion in history at 17 years old. This tendency continued during the following two decades, reaching its peak between the 1980s and 1990s. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> decline in the 1990s. Félix Trinidad was Puerto Rico's most notable champion during this period. The 2000s brought another increase, as over a dozen boxers won world championships.|$|E
5|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> {{delay in}} {{the start of the}} game as some of the glass needed to be fixed. Once the game was under way it took just 1:50 before the Crunch's Jon Mirasty and the Senators' Jeremy Yablonski engaged in the first fight in Outdoor Classic history. Mirasty had {{previously}} stated {{that he was going to}} be involved in the first outdoor fight. The physical play continued and minutes later at the 3:29 mark Paul Baier and Mike Radja were given matching roughing minor penalties. Not long after the matching minors Mike Blunden made a pass to Alexandre Picard to send him on a breakaway. Picard became the first player to score in an Outdoor Classic when he beat Senators' goaltender Mike Brodeur putting the Crunch up 1–0. The score remained the same at the end of a penalty-filled first period. Eight total penalties were called on the two clubs through the first 20 minutes of the game.|$|E

25|$|Newfoundland went decimal in 1865, {{but unlike}} the Province of Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia, it decided to adopt a unit based on the Spanish dollar {{rather than on the}} U.S. dollar, and there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> {{difference}} between these two units.
