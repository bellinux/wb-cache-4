30|$|Rank {{and type}} of coal are {{fundamental}} factors that control coal characteristics such as the coking properties {{as well as other}} numerous technological applications[3]. The effort to source for coking coals, for Nigerian iron and steel industries, has led to the evaluation of coal deposits {{in different parts of the}} country; it was discovered that majority of the Nigerian coals are sub-bituminous and lignitic in rank[4, 5]. The coals that were explored and documented are lignites of high volatile matter content, <b>weakly</b> <b>coking</b> <b>coals</b> and medium-coking coals[6]. Therefore, most Nigerian coals are known to be non-coking, but some of them can be blended to obtain blast furnace coke[7, 8, 9].|$|E

The quarterly data of Australian dollar exchange rate with the US dollar, Australian <b>coking</b> <b>coal</b> price and the Australian <b>coking</b> <b>coal</b> export from 1992 – 2009 are employed to examine the relationships. This study reveals that the Australian <b>coking</b> <b>coal</b> export has positive relationships with the exchange rate of A$/US$ and price of Australian <b>coking</b> <b>coal.</b> This study finds that the Australian <b>coking</b> <b>coal</b> exporters lose revenues when the value of Australian dollar is high {{and at the same}} time, the Australian <b>coking</b> <b>coal</b> exporters earns more revenues from the higher price of Australian <b>coking</b> <b>coal.</b> The empirical results of this analysis confirm that for each one cent increase in Australian dollar value against the US$, the Australian <b>coking</b> <b>coal</b> export increases by 249, 724 tonnes and for each one dollar price increase of Australian <b>coking</b> <b>coal,</b> the Australian <b>coking</b> <b>coal</b> export increases by 10, 232 tonnes...|$|R

50|$|Unscientific mining {{practices}} {{adopted by}} some of them and poor working conditions of labor {{in some of the}} private coal mines became matters of concern for the Government. On account of these reasons, the Central Government took a decision to nationalize the private coal mines. The nationalization was done in two phases, the first with the <b>coking</b> <b>coal</b> mines in 1971-72 and then with the non-coking coal mines in 1973. In October, 1971, the <b>Coking</b> <b>Coal</b> Mines (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1971 provided for taking over in public interest of the management of <b>coking</b> <b>coal</b> mines and coke oven plants pending nationalization. This was followed by the <b>Coking</b> <b>Coal</b> Mines (Nationalization) Act, 1972 under which the <b>coking</b> <b>coal</b> mines and the coke oven plants other than those with the Tata Iron & Steel Company Limited and Indian Iron & Steel Company Limited, were nationalized on May 1, 1972 and brought under the Bharat <b>Coking</b> <b>Coal</b> Limited (BCCL), a new Central Government Undertaking. Another enactment, namely the Coal Mines (Taking Over of Management) Act, 1973, extended the right of the Government of India to take over the management of the <b>coking</b> and non-coking <b>coal</b> mines in seven States including the <b>coking</b> <b>coal</b> mines taken over in 1971. This was followed by the nationalization of all these mines on May 1, 1973 with the enactment of the Coal Mines (Nationalization) Act, 1973 which now is the piece of Central legislation determining the eligibility of coal mining in India.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Industrial washing oil as solvent, super pure coal was {{extracted}} {{and prepared}} from raw coal using heat extraction technology. The structures of raw coal and super pure coal {{were characterized by}} thermogravimetry and Fu Liye infrared spectrum. The {{results showed that the}} heat extraction rate of super pure coal was decreased with the increasing of coalification degree. The ash of raw coal which were silicate and alumina can be concentrated by heat extraction technology into coal residue and the mixtures of various structure were mainly composed of aromatic hydrocarbons also can be extracted effectively. With the production capacity of China's iron and steel industry continues to expand, the amount of coke continued to rise. Coking process is current still in <b>coking</b> <b>coal</b> (<b>coking</b> <b>coal,</b> fat coal, fat gas coal, gas coal, 1 / 3 <b>coking</b> <b>coal,</b> lean <b>coal,</b> etc.). Although <b>coking</b> <b>coal</b> is the full range in our country, it is a relatively small species, especially the quality of <b>coking</b> <b>coal</b> is scarce varieties. It is mainly distributed in the Permian and Carboniferous, Permian coal-bearing strata in Southern China.
