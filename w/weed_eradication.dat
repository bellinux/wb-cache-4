40|$|There {{has been}} recent {{interest}} {{in determining the}} upper limits to the feasibility of <b>weed</b> <b>eradication.</b> Although a number of disparate factors determine the success of an eradication program, ultimately eradication feasibility must be viewed {{in the context of}} the amount of investment that can be made. The latter should reflect the hazard posed by an invasion, with greater investment justified by greater threats. In simplest terms, the effort (and hence investment) to achieve <b>weed</b> <b>eradication</b> comprises the detection effort required to delimit an invasion plus the search and control effort required to prevent reproduction until extirpation occurs over the entire infested area. The difficulty of estimating the required investment at the commencement of a <b>weed</b> <b>eradication</b> program (as well as during periodic reviews) is a serious problem. Bioeconomics show promise in determining the optimal approach to managing weed invasions, notwithstanding ongoing difficulties in estimating the costs and benefits of eradication and alternative invasion management strategies.

40|$|Divergence {{in plant}} traits and trait {{plasticity}} after invasion {{has been proposed}} as an important mechanism favoring invasion success.

A correlation between responses to a controlled aging test performed at 45 degrees C, 60 % relative humidity (RH) and seed persistence in the field has recently been suggested. Here we investigated whether collections of differing quality of two closely related invasive weeds, Chrysanthemoides monilifera ssp. monilifera and ssp. rotundata (boneseed and bitou bush, respectively), had different seed longevity using the controlled aging test. Chrysanthemoides monilifera ssp. monilifera fruits were collected from across five Australian states, and C. monilifera ssp. rotundata from one state, covering their invasive ranges. Seed quality was assessed visually and using tetrazolium staining, and a series of germination tests established appropriate germination conditions. The controlled aging test was run for a subset of collections. Chrysanthemoides monilifera ssp. rotundata seeds died more quickly (time to lose 50 % viability, P(50) = 16 days) than the C. monilifera ssp. monilifera collections (P(50) = 47 days) when aged at 45 degrees C and 60 % RH. This difference was significant even considering the large differences in longevity between C. monilifera ssp. monilifera populations (P(50) = 35 - 61 days; probably due to differences in maturity at collection). Based on a published correlation, we predict that mature C. monilifera ssp. monilifera may have a long-lived (> 3 years) seed bank and C. monilifera ssp. rotundata may have a transient (< 1 year) seed bank.

40|$|<b>Weed</b> <b>eradication</b> {{programs}} {{often require}} 10 {{years or more}} to achieve their objective. It is important that progress is evaluated {{on a regular basis}} so that programs that are 'on track' can be distinguished from those that are unlikely to succeed. Earlier research has addressed conformity of eradication programs to the delimitation criterion. In this paper evaluation in relation to the containment and extirpation criteria is considered. Because strong evidence of containment failure (i. e. spread from infestations targeted for eradication) is difficult to obtain, it generally will not be practicable to evaluate how effective eradication programs are at containing the target species. However, chronic failure of containment will be reflected in sustained increases in cumulative infested area and thus a failure to delimit a weed invasion. Evaluating the degree of conformity to the delimitation and extirpation criteria is therefore sufficient to give an appraisal of progress towards the eradication objective. A significant step towards eradication occurs when a weed is no longer readily detectable at an infested site, signalling entry to the monitoring phase. This transition will occur more quickly if reproduction is prevented consistently. Where an invasion consists of multiple infestations, the monitoring profile (frequency distribution of time since detection) provides a summary of the overall effectiveness of the eradication program in meeting the extirpation criterion. Eradication is generally claimed when the target species has not been detected for a period equal to or greater than its seed longevity, although there is often considerable uncertainty in estimates of the latter. Recently developed methods, which take into consideration the cost of continued monitoring vs. the potential cost of damage should a weed escape owing to premature cessation of an eradication program, can assist managers to decide when to terminate <b>weed</b> <b>eradication</b> programs...|$|E

40|$|Invasive garden plants, also {{referred}} to as garden escapes, make up the bulk of environmental and agricultural weeds in Australia and gardening remains the most significant contributor to its spread. Gardening is also regarded as the most popular recreational activity in Australia, particularly among older adults who continue to seek new and exotic plants. As a result of this, and despite the notoriety of some of these plants which are considered to be noxious, garden escapes continue to be sold in nurseries and cultivated in domestic gardens. This research is, therefore, founded upon the prevalence of invasive plants on nursery shelves and in domestic gardens from where they spread into the wider environment. It explores the links between gardening and the spread of garden escapes so as to determine how current remediation efforts might be improved upon. Weed management strategies typically seek to provide gardeners with more information about the invasiveness of some garden plants, with the aim of fostering a change in their gardening behaviour. However, research has shown that there are factors other than an information deficit which lead to the presence of invasive species in gardens, hence the need for a shift in management outlook. Using social practice theory, this study reconceptualises gardening as a ‘practice’ that is made up of several constituting elements which work together to determine the way it is performed. These elements include the materials which aid the performance of the practice, the competences which practitioners need for a successful performance, and the meanings associated with the practice. All three have to be present in a particular configuration in order for gardening to be successfully performed and changing any one element results in a corresponding change in the practice itself. On the basis of this theoretical framework, this research explores gardening enactments to determine which elements are currently associated with it and how these relate to garden escapes. This will, in turn, highlight potential avenues through which management interventions might be better directed to ultimately foster the much needed change in enactments that lead to garden escapes. To achieve the objectives of this study, 15 weed managers were interviewed to elicit baseline knowledge {{about the extent to which}} garden escapes are a problem within the Sydney Basin. This information was then incorporated into subsequent semi-structured interviews with 27 gardeners who were asked to give detailed accounts of their gardening enactments. The recruitment of weed managers was done mostly through snowballing from existing contacts while the gardeners were recruited through garden clubs and using radio broadcasts. All participants involved were located within the Sydney Basin Bioregion, New South Wales, which was chosen as the study site for its rich abundance of plants and nurseries as well as its eclectic diversity of gardeners. The findings revealed that gardening is in fact shaped by underlying elements which determine its performance, and this was evident in four main ways. First, gardeners’ approach to gardening was shown to largely stem from a desire for the presence of animals in the garden space, and this led to a passive involvement in <b>weed</b> prevention and <b>eradication.</b> Secondly, experiential and social learning were shown to be the preferred way by which gardeners learn and this had to do with a perception that friends and family are the most reliable sources of gardening advice. Plant choices made by gardeners were not only driven by aesthetic ideals but also age and time constraints, which led to the cultivation of flamboyant and low maintenance plant species respectively. The fourth aspect of gardening enactments that holds some relevance for the spread of garden escapes relates to plant exchanges which the gardeners described as being a normal part of the practice. These exchanges were understood to be a physical demonstration of shared friendship ideals, and were also driven by gardeners’ need to obtain plants as cheaply as possible. So not only are plant choices determined by aesthetics and low maintenance needs but affordability was also important, especially considering that most participants are retired and on a pension. Plant swapping, however, is one obvious way by which gardeners aid the spread of potentially invasive plants from one location to another, thereby perpetuating the garden escapes problem. Conceptually, this research advances the utility of practice theory in the area of natural resource management where it has previously not been applied. The theory offers a more comprehensive way of apprehending gardening enactments, in contrast to other research approaches which focus exclusively on either the human gardeners or non-human actors. In this way, it opens up points of management intervention that may not have been previously considered. Recommendations have been made regarding potential intervention strategies that are based on the practice approach adopted here, and these offer a more targeted way of managing garden escapes. This research also contributes to ongoing debates surrounding the suitability of interviews as a methodological tool for eliciting accounts of routine practices. The merits of this data collection instrument are evident in the detailed and uninhibited responses given by the participants of this study, in relation to such a routine practice as gardening...|$|R
