5|$|The Ashleys and Ashley-Coopers {{have made}} Wimborne St Giles their home since the 15th century. The small village of Wimborne St Giles rests {{within the family}} estate itself.

5|$|The {{aircraft}} was a Boeing 707 which had accumulated 26,319 airframe hours since its first flight in 1959. It was piloted by Captain Volney D. Matheny, 45, who had 18,753 hours of pilot time. The copilot was First Officer Ronald G. Reichardt, 26, with 1,629 total piloting hours, {{and the flight}} engineer <b>was</b> <b>Robert</b> D. Barron, 39, who had accumulated 11,182 hours as a flight engineer. The stewardesses were Janan Perkins, 21, Roswitha Neal, 25, Kathleen Fankhouser, 21, and Sara Muir, 25.|$|E
5|$|The casting of Hopper, the film's villain, proved problematic. Lasseter's top choice <b>was</b> <b>Robert</b> De Niro, who {{repeatedly}} {{turned the}} part down, as did {{a succession of}} other actors. Kevin Spacey met John Lasseter at the 1995 Academy Awards and Lasseter asked Spacey {{if he would be}} interested in doing the voice of Hopper. Spacey was delighted and signed on immediately.|$|E
5|$|The justice married Mabel de Limesy, {{daughter}} of Gerard de Limesy, and coheir with her sisters of their brother John de Limesy, with the marriage {{taking place in}} 1200. When he died, his heir <b>was</b> <b>Robert</b> Bardulf, his brother. Hugh Bardulf gave land capable of pasturing 500 sheep to Barlings Abbey. Robert, his heir, offered a £1,000 fine to receive the inheritance, and William de Briouze made an identical offer {{for the right to}} marry his son to Mabel, Hugh's widow.|$|E

5|$|The only item of note {{to emerge}} from No Sirree! <b>was</b> <b>Robert</b> Benchley's contribution, The Treasurer's Report. Benchley's disjointed parody so delighted those in {{attendance}} that Irving Berlin hired Benchley in 1923 to deliver the Report as part of Berlin's Music Box Revue for $500 a week. In 1928, Report was later made into a short sound film in the Fox Movietone sound-on-film system by Fox Film Corporation. The film {{marked the beginning of}} a second career for Benchley in Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|Among the bishops, {{only two}} stood out as {{significant}} political figures, the more prominent of whom <b>was</b> <b>Robert</b> Winchelsey, Archbishop of Canterbury. Long a formidable presence in English public life, Winchelsey {{had led the}} struggle against Edward I to uphold {{the autonomy of the}} church, and for this he had paid with suspension and exile. One of Edward II’s first acts as king had been to reinstate Winchelsey, but rather than responding with grateful loyalty, the archbishop soon reassumed a leadership role in the fight against the king. Although he was trying to appease Winchelsey, the king carried an old grudge against another prelate, Walter Langton, Bishop of Lichfield. Edward had Langton dismissed from his position as treasurer of the Exchequer and had his temporal possessions confiscated. Langton had been an opponent of Winchelsey during the previous reign, but Edward II’s move against Langton drew the two Ordainers together.|$|E
5|$|Another {{person to}} testify <b>was</b> <b>Robert</b> Havelka, {{who worked as}} a {{security}} guard the night of the incident. Havelka said that the guardrail was too close to the stage, but not so close as to make a platform for climbing the stage. He testified that he pulled one person off the stage and that another person fell off before he could be secured. He further said that the fan's fall might have been helped by someone else, perhaps the singer, though he did not see it precisely.|$|E

5|$|Cunard, who {{was back}} in Halifax, {{unfortunately}} {{did not know of}} the tender until after the deadline. He returned to London and started negotiations with Admiral Parry, who was Cunard's good friend from when Parry was a young officer stationed in Halifax 20 years earlier. Cunard offered Parry a fortnightly service beginning in May 1840. While Cunard did not then own a steamship, he had been an investor in an earlier steamship venture, Royal William, and owned coal mines in Nova Scotia. Cunard's major backer <b>was</b> <b>Robert</b> Napier whose Robert Napier and Sons was the Royal Navy's supplier of steam engines. He also had the strong backing of Nova Scotian political leaders at the time when London needed to rebuild support in British North America after the rebellion.|$|E
5|$|Ifs {{new owner}} <b>was</b> <b>Robert</b> Guinn, of Galaxy Publishing. The change of {{ownership}} was abrupt {{and led to a}} delay in publication, with the first issue under new editorship not appearing until July 1959. The editor was Horace Gold, who was also the editor of Galaxy Science Fiction; Galaxy had gone from a monthly to a bimonthly schedule at the start of 1959, and If and Galaxy appeared in alternate months for the next few years. In a 1975 retrospective article, Gold commented that his policy with If was to experiment, using new writers who had not yet established themselves. In the judgement of science-fiction historian Mike Ashley, the effect was that If became the weaker of the two magazines, printing stories that were of lower quality than those Gold selected for Galaxy.|$|E
5|$|In August 2007, {{incumbent}} Pryce {{announced her}} retirement {{at the end}} of her elected term. The Democrats felt that the seat continued to be vulnerable. Kilroy announced her intention to again seek the 15th District seat in 2008. She ran against Republican Steve Stivers, a State Senator from the 16th District, Libertarian Mark M. Noble, and Independent candidate Don Elijah Eckhart. The race was considered to be one of the most important U.S. House of Representatives races to watch in the country. The last Democrat to hold the 15th district <b>was</b> <b>Robert</b> T. Secrest in the mid-1960s, but with Republican voters moving out of the district into the northern suburbs of Columbus, Ohio since the 1990s, the district became more evenly matched.|$|E

5|$|Matilda's half-brother, Robert of Gloucester, {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{powerful}} Anglo-Norman barons, controlling estates in Normandy as well as the Earldom of Gloucester. In 1138, he rebelled against Stephen, starting the descent into civil war in England. Robert renounced his fealty to the King and declared his support for Matilda, which triggered a major regional rebellion in Kent and across the south-west of England, although he himself remained in Normandy. Matilda had not been particularly active in asserting her claims to the throne since 1135 and in many ways it <b>was</b> <b>Robert</b> who took the initiative in declaring war in 1138. In France, Geoffrey took advantage of the situation by re-invading Normandy. David of Scotland also invaded the north of England once again, announcing that he was supporting the claim of Matilda to the throne, pushing south into Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|Michael de la Pole {{had been}} {{instrumental}} in the marriage negotiations; he had the king's confidence and gradually became more involved at court and in government as Richard came of age. De la Pole came from an upstart merchant family. When Richard made him chancellor in 1383, and created him Earl of Suffolk two years later, this antagonised the more established nobility. Another member of the close circle around the king <b>was</b> <b>Robert</b> de Vere, Earl of Oxford, who in this period emerged as the king's favourite. Richard's close friendship to de Vere was also disagreeable to the political establishment. This displeasure was exacerbated by the earl's elevation to the new title of Duke of Ireland in 1386. The chronicler Thomas Walsingham suggested {{the relationship between the}} king and de Vere was of a homosexual nature, due to a resentment Walsingham had toward the king.|$|E
5|$|No limit {{was placed}} on the number of {{appointments}} which could be made. King EdwardVII appointed 97 Knights Grand Cross, plus an additional 239honorary Knights Grand Cross, between his accession to the throne on 22January 1901 and his death on 6May 1910. Of those 97, 6 were members of his own family, 3 were Indian princes, 1 was an archbishop, 31 were already peers and 56 were knights (including 8 baronets). Of the total substantive appointments, 30 were to serving commissioned officers, including General Sir John French and Admiral of the Fleet John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher. Amongst the civilian appointments <b>was</b> <b>Robert</b> Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury, who had been Prime Minister of the United Kingdom three times: 1885–86, 1886–92 and 1895–1902.|$|E
