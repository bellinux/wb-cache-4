40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{is to provide a}} robust and {{efficient}} method to design a flap assembly to be resistant to a full scale experimental bird strike in according to the airworthiness certifications. In particular this paper analyses the full assembly of a CFRP flap including <b>wing</b> <b>track</b> attachments ready to be tested a birdstrike scenario. Before to introduce the impact simulations on the entire flap, a dedicated model calibration, which fully reflect ASTM procedure of tensile and compression tests have been prepared and simulation results, have been compared with typical experimental tests expected for a CFRP material. Furthermore the dimensioning of the roller carriages, which are the links between the flap tracks, has represented a critical issue in the interference aspects between the flap and the wing box, then a detailed evaluation of the links allowed to size the fixture for a fullscale test case. Using of an iterative approach, all failure parameter requested have been properly tuned. Then the calibration impact projectile is introduced to study the interaction between the bird (equivalent gelatine) and the target including the equation of state and contacts. Flap object of this work is equipped on a medium rage turbojet aircraft of about one hundred twenty seats. The flap model is a single slotted flap fixed to the main component with two tracks respectively, staring from the wing root. The impact condition presents for all flap deflections not affected by wing, fan cowl and track shadow. This paper present the analysis of bird strike with flap assembled on wing tracks. For this particular topic, a dedicated session has been developed in order to apply the most representative track installation. Finally an extensive campaign of impacts were performed on the inboard flap. Particular attention on the track zones is dedicated when the flap is fully opened. These zones are very critical because failure of links is a failure of complete systems. Results of the impacts analysis are presented in terms of visual damage and history forces reaction on link and carriage. Moreover the strain of the most critical items will be surveyed (rear spar damage). Result overview allows the selection of the bird impact points based on links and composite failure criteria, in particular on the flap tracks metallic attachments, and lower skin and rear spar damage; Result of current work have allowed to establish robust criteria and to define most critical impact points need to be investigated by means of a strike test. Reducing number of shots a two location allow laboratories to perform test bus using of a unique test specimen saving time and cost. The conclusion of this activity is dedicated a comparison of test result performed and relevant analysis. For the two shots strain gauge and force reaction history acquisition will be compared...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} an algorithm for {{the automated}} deformation capture of hoverfly wings from multiple camera image sequences. The algorithm {{is capable of}} extracting dense surface measurements, {{without the aid of}} fiducial markers, over an arbitrary number of wingbeats of hovering flight and requires limited manual initialisation. A novel motion prediction method, called the ‘normalised stroke model’, makes use of the similarity of adjacent wing strokes to predict wing keypoint locations, which are then iteratively refined in a stereo image registration procedure. Outlier removal, wing fitting and further refinement using independently reconstructed boundary points complete the algorithm. It was tested on two hovering data sets, as well as a challenging flight manoeuvre. By comparing the 3 -d positions of keypoints extracted from these surfaces with those resulting from manual identification, the accuracy of the algorithm is shown to approach that of a fully manual approach. In particular, half of the algorithm-extracted keypoints were within 0. 17 mm of manually identified keypoints, approximately equal to the error of the manual identification process. This algorithm is unique among purely image based flapping flight studies in the level of automation it achieves, and its generality would make it applicable to <b>wing</b> <b>tracking</b> of other insects...|$|R

40|$|Insects exhibit {{impressive}} navigational abilities, {{from long}} distance migrations of monarch butterflies to path integration of desert ants in the genus Cataglyphis. Celestial cues — including polarized light and solar position — provide valuable information to navigating insects, {{and the brain}} regions that process this information appear largely conserved. Although not generally considered migratory, mark-recapture experiments indicate that Drosophila can cover 10 km of open desert in perhaps {{as little as a}} few hours without stopping to refuel. This impressive feat required flies to adopt a fairly straight path, likely accomplished by visually-guided navigation using celestial cues. Like many insects Drosophila possess the ability to navigate using the polarization pattern of skylight but sun-compass navigation in this genus has not been examined. Using a flight simulator with machine-vision <b>wing</b> <b>tracking,</b> we found that tethered D. melanogaster can use the position of a simulated sun to fly straight, and individuals vary in their heading preference. This preferred heading is maintained over short intervals, but fidelity decays as the time between flights is increased. By training flies with a stimulus restricted to one half of the arena, we could bias subsequent headings towards the side of the training stimulus. These findings suggest that flight and/or visual experience can influence heading, although the neural basis remains unknown. Drosophila sun compass navigation has the potential for future behavioral, ecological and neurobiological studies that could shed light on the deep evolutionary roots of visually-guided locomotion...|$|R

2500|$|Columbias {{flight data}} {{recorder}} was found near Hemphill, Texas, on March 19, 2003. Unlike commercial jet aircraft, the space shuttles did not have {{flight data recorder}}s intended for after-crash analysis. [...] Instead, the vehicle data were transmitted in real time to the ground via telemetry. Since Columbia was the first shuttle, it had a special flight data OEX (Orbiter EXperiments) recorder, designed to help engineers better understand vehicle performance during the first test flights. After the initial Shuttle test-flights were completed, the recorder was never removed from Columbia, {{and it was still}} functioning on the crashed flight. It recorded many hundreds of parameters, and contained very extensive logs of structural and other data, which allowed the CAIB to reconstruct many of the events during the process leading to breakup. Investigators could often use the loss of signals from sensors on the <b>wing</b> to <b>track</b> how the damage progressed.

40|$|AbstractA 6 -degree {{of freedom}} (6 -DOF) {{aircraft}} wing position and pose automatic adjustment method {{is presented to}} improve ARJ 21 wing-fuselage connection precision and efficiency. Wing position and pose are adjusted by three pillars which are driven by six high-precision servo motors. During the adjustment process, <b>wing</b> is <b>tracked</b> and positioned by laser tracker. Wing initial position and pose are calibrated by using the measurement coordinates of assembly reference points. Wing target position and pose are calculated according to wing initial, fuselage position and pose, and relative position and pose requirements between wing and fuselage for the connection. Combining Newton-Euler method with quaternion position and pose analyzing method, the inverse kinematics of servo motors, together with the adjustment system dynamics is obtained. Wing quintic polynomial trajectory planning algorithm based on quaternion is proposed; the initial, target position and pose need to be solved and the intermediate moving path is uncertain. Simulation {{results show that the}} adjustment method has good dynamic characteristics and satisfies engineering requirements. Preliminary engineering application indicates that ARJ 21 wing adjustment efficiency and precision are improved by using the proposed method...|$|R
50|$|In the {{sideslip}} condition, the airplane's {{longitudinal axis}} remains {{parallel to the}} original flightpath, but the airplane no longer flies straight along its original track. Now, the horizontal component of lift forces the airplane to move sideways toward the low wing. This is the still-air, headwind or tailwind scenario. In case of crosswind, if the wing is lowered into the wind, the wind may push the airplane downwind and airplane may fly the original track. This is the sideslip approach technique used by many pilots in crosswind conditions without slipping. Other method is the crab-technique in which nose is pointed into {{the wind and the}} resulting drift keeps the airplane on the desired <b>track.</b> <b>Wings</b> are maintained level all the time.|$|R
