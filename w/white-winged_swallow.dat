50|$|The <b>white-winged</b> <b>swallow</b> is {{classified}} as Least Concern by the IUCN, based on its very large range, apparently stable population, and large population size.|$|E
50|$|The <b>white-winged</b> <b>swallow</b> (Tachycineta albiventer) is a {{resident}} breeding swallow in tropical South America from Colombia, Venezuela, and Trinidad south to northern Argentina. It is not found {{west of the}} Andes. This swallow is largely non-migratory.|$|E
50|$|The <b>white-winged</b> <b>swallow</b> is {{native to}} Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela. Occasional vagrants reach Panama. They are usually not found on the Pacific coast, {{especially}} in the southern portion of South America.|$|E
50|$|<b>White-winged</b> <b>swallows</b> can be {{distinguished}} from the similar mangrove swallow {{by the lack of}} a white line above its lores and a greater amount of white on its wings.|$|R
50|$|The <b>white-winged</b> <b>swallow</b> feeds {{primarily}} in flight {{at a low}} altitude, catching flying insects. It usually forages over water but may also feeds over land. In between foraging attempts, it usually perches on branches near bodies of water. Flight paths are direct and they fly with a flapping flight.|$|E
50|$|The <b>white-winged</b> <b>swallow</b> is {{resident}} {{in most of}} its range, although it is migratory in the southernmost part of its range. In Brazil and Argentina, it is only present from approximately mid September to mid April. Where this population winters is not well known, but it is most likely in the Guianas, Venezuela, and Columbia.|$|E
50|$|Species seen: bananaquit, palm tanager, blue-gray tanager, spectacled thrush, ruddy ground dove, yellow oriole, least grebe, {{southern}} lapwing, <b>white-winged</b> <b>swallow,</b> pied water-tyrant, golden-headed manakin, bay-headed tanager, white-bearded manakin, laughing gull, royal tern, large-billed tern, cattle egret, black skimmer, common potoo, scarlet ibis, white-necked jacobin, tufted coquette, oilbird, red-legged honeycreeper, tropical kingbird, red-crowned woodpecker, rufous-vented chachalaca and red-billed tropicbird.|$|E
50|$|The <b>white-winged</b> <b>swallow</b> {{builds a}} cup nest lined with other birds' {{feathers}} and some seed inside a tree hole, between boulders or in man-made structures. Nests are usually built a few metres above water; pairs nest separately. The clutch is {{three to six}} white eggs, measuring 17 - 20 x 13 - 14.6 mm in size and weighing 1.9 g.|$|E
50|$|Threatened and {{vulnerable}} species include West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus), pearly parakeet (Pyrrhura lepida), bearded bellbird (Procnias averano), wattled jacana (Jacana jacana) and American purple gallinule (Porphyrula martinica).Other bird species include striated heron (Butorides striata), black-bellied whistling duck (Dendrocygna autumnalis), great egret (Ardea alba), ringed kingfisher (Megaceryle torquata), blue dacnis (Dacnis cayana), rufescent tiger heron (Tigrisoma lineatum), white-faced whistling duck (Dendrocygna viduata), Neotropic cormorant (Phalacrocorax brasilianus) and <b>white-winged</b> <b>swallow</b> (Tachycineta albiventer).|$|E
50|$|The {{species was}} {{formerly}} considered a subspecies of the Chilean swallow, most {{likely due to}} the similarity in morphology and calls. It is occasionally placed in the genus Iridoprocne with the tree swallow, mangrove swallow, <b>white-winged</b> <b>swallow,</b> and Chilean swallow. A study of the mitochondrial DNA of Tachycineta supports the split, although studies do show that the white-rumped swallow forms a superspecies, leucorrhoa, with the Chilean swallow. This species is monotypic, with no known subspecies.|$|E
50|$|These {{birds are}} {{insectivores}} and feed in the air. When foraging, they fly rapidly in a zigzag path or circle above the water, skimming {{the water in}} some cases. They occasionally perch on boulders or small outcroppings above the water. They forage low over the water and occasionally near forests, clearings, or grassy areas with bushes. These birds usually forage alone or in small groups, occasionally with the black-collared swallow and the <b>white-winged</b> <b>swallow.</b> Although this is true, they usually stay closer to rocks.|$|E
50|$|The adult <b>white-winged</b> <b>swallow</b> is 14 cm {{long and}} weighs 14 - 17 g. It has {{iridescent}} blue-green upperparts, white underparts and rump, and white edgings to the secondary flight feathers. The wings are otherwise black, {{along with the}} tail. It has dark brown eyes and a black bill and legs. The sexes are similar, although {{it is noted that}} the females have slightly less white on the wing. Juveniles have grayer underparts and are duller in general when compared to the adults. The juvenile also has less white on the wing.|$|E
5000|$|All nine Tachycineta {{species have}} glossy {{blue or green}} backs and white underparts, but the five species with white rumps [...] - [...] the {{mangrove}} swallow, Tumbes swallow, <b>white-winged</b> <b>swallow,</b> white-rumped swallow and Chilean swallow [...] - [...] are particularly closely related, the first three and the last two forming two superspecies. The Tumbes swallow of coastal Peru was formerly {{considered to be a}} subspecies of the mangrove swallow, but its calls, behaviour, and cytochrome b data indicate that it should be considered as a separate species. It is also differentiated from the mangrove swallow by its lack of a supraloral white line and by its slight difference in size.|$|E
