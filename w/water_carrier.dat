5|$|A notable {{feature on}} the wall of the front porch on the ground floor is a foot print on a stone slab. It is said that this foot print belonged to a {{resident}} of the monastery, who was a <b>water</b> <b>carrier,</b> known as Chitenpa. He served in the monastery for a long time and on one fine day he announced that he had completed his service to the monastery and then stamped his left foot on the stone slab which created a dented formation of his step. This step is venerated as a miracle in view of a belief among the people of the region that such an imprint on a stone slab could only be created by a divine person who was a true devotee of the monastery.|$|E
5|$|In September 1923, new {{regulations}} were promulgated, dividing the navy into a fleet, a river flotilla, and naval aviation. Later that month a Naval Command was established, based in Zemun, near Belgrade. The Navy Department, {{now known as}} Navy Section, was then only responsible for purely administrative matters, with Naval Command responsible for all operational questions. The service's initially unrealistic expansion goals of 24 destroyers and 24 submarines were soon shelved, {{and by the end}} of 1923 the fleet consisted of eight 250t-class torpedo boats, four Kaiman-class torpedo boats, six s, four Schichau-class minesweepers, the <b>water</b> <b>carrier</b> Perun (ex-Cyclop), the yachts Vila (ex-Dalmat) and Lada (ex-Quarnero), the training ship Vila Velebit, the salvage vessel Moćni (ex-Gigant), and four tugs. Kumbor (ex-Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf) had been sold for scrap in 1922, and three of the minesweepers were disposed of in 1924, as were the four hulks. The four river monitors remained in service, as Vardar, Drava, Morava and Sava respectively. They were supported by two motor patrol boats and three river tugs.|$|E

25|$|In September 1953, Israel {{advanced}} {{plans for}} its National <b>Water</b> <b>Carrier</b> to help irrigate the coastal Sharon Plain {{and eventually the}} Negev desert by launching a diversion project on a nine-mile (14km) channel midway between the Huleh Marshes and Lake Galilee (Lake Tiberias) in the central DMZ to be rapidly constructed.

25|$|In 1964, Israel began {{operating}} a pumping station that diverts {{water from the}} Sea of Galilee to the National <b>Water</b> <b>Carrier.</b> Also in 1964, Jordan constructed a channel that diverted water from the Yarmouk River, another main tributary of the Jordan River to the East Ghor Canal. Syria has also built reservoirs that catch the Yarmouk's waters. Environmentalists blame Israel, Jordan and Syria for extensive damage to the Jordan River ecosystem.|$|E

25|$|In January 2009 Mekorot said {{it would}} invest more than NIS 2 billion (US$500 million) in a new National Water System with several east-west arteries relying on pumping, {{complementing}} and partly substituting for the National <b>Water</b> <b>Carrier</b> running {{from north to south}} that relied on gravity. The new pipelines would connect the five new desalination plants along the coast with water users. The project would include the construction of 100-kilometer water channels, advanced quality control and command systems, and water reservoirs. When completed, most drinking water supplied to Israel’s residents from Hadera southwards – in other words, most of the country’s population – would come from desalinated seawater.|$|E

25|$|Artificial {{groundwater}} recharge is practiced extensively in Israel from flood water, potable {{water from the}} National <b>Water</b> <b>Carrier</b> and treated wastewater. Artificial recharge has increased groundwater levels in the Coastal Aquifer and counteracted further seawater intrusion. Groundwater recharge from flood water is done by collecting runoff from winter rains in a drainage basin and directing it into recharge ponds. The groundwater is then pumped back up during summer through wells around the recharge ponds. The cost of the recharge process is limited to maintenance, with pumping costs amounting to only $0.02–0.03 per cubic meter. About 40–50% more water than the average recharge is pumped from the aquifer {{in order to create}} a temporary hydrological depression that creates space for artificial recharge the following winter.|$|E

Shortly thereafter she was engaged as permanent member of the company. She went on to sing many leading roles with the Hofoper and appeared in several world premieres.

Stivers was discharged on August 5, 1876, while encamped with his unit at the mouth of Rosebud Creek in the Montana Territory, and returned to Kentucky where he attempted to go into business for himself. He died less than a year later, murdered over a business dispute, in Kingston on June 28, 1877, at age 27. Stivers was buried in the city cemetery of nearby Richmond, Kentucky.|$|R
