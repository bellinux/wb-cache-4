25|$|Wright {{relocated}} {{his practice}} {{to his home}} in 1898 in order to bring his <b>work</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> lives closer. This move made further sense as the majority of the architect's projects at that time were in Oak Park or neighboring River Forest. The birth of three more children — Catherine in 1894, David in 1895, and Frances in 1898 — prompted Wright to sacrifice his original home studio space for additional bedrooms and necessitated his design and construction of an expansive studio addition {{to the north of the}} main house. The space, which included a hanging balcony within the two-story drafting room, was one of Wright's first experiments with innovative structure. The studio was a poster for Wright's developing aesthetics and would become the laboratory from which the next ten years of architectural creations would emerge.|$|E

Despite never referring to herself as feminist within the show, Clair proudly embodies several feminist themes and beliefs, remaining, according to The Daily Dots Nico Lang, [...] "an outspoken advocate for equality in her household, fighting sexism while setting an example for her daughters." [...] From the sitcom's earliest stages, Cosby had always intended for Clair to reflect the ever-changing <b>work</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> dynamic, explaining, [...] "If this was 1964 ... my wife could do the cooking and I could be {{the guy on the}} sofa who just says, ‘Let your mother handle this.’ But today a lot of things have changed and I want the show to reflect those changes." [...] According to Rotten Tomatoes' Alex Vo, Clair represents [...] "the rapidly changing gender and household roles from the 1980s and onward." [...] MeTV agreed that Clair is [...] "the '80s response to the '50s housewife." [...] Although feminism was hardly a new concept to sitcoms by the time The Cosby Show premiered, feminist television characters remained scare during the early 1980s. The Huffington Posts Dr. Mlsee Harris observed that, during this time, [...] "The stereotypical role of the black woman on television ... had been that of a financially struggling, single woman with dysfunctional relationships, trying to get her life together with no distinct direction", stereotypes Clair worked to defy.

[...] Additionally, the character is skilled in 17 different types of kung fu. At one point an indestructible supersuit complete with special abilities was created for Kim, but the outfit was ultimately abandoned to avoid contradicting with the character's [...] "she can do anything" [...] motto. Elaborating on her role in the pilot, Schooley believes that [...] "Kim's mix of tenacity, intelligence and heart makes for a very strong female role model for kids," [...] however, [...] "Sure she can save the world, but that doesn't help her a bit when she comes face-to-face with her latest school crush." [...] Furthermore, the writers envisioned the character having her own website and hand-held communicator – named the [...] "Kimmunicator" [...] after the character – with video chat, both of which were considered revolutionary back in 2000, a time when few young people owned cellphones.
