500|$|In {{the early}} years of preservation, the line {{struggled}} to operate using the original rolling stock. When the line was taken over in 1950 Dolgoch was the only operating locomotive and it was apparent that it was in need of a major overhaul. To enable operations to continue two further steam locomotives, Nos.3 and 4, were purchased from the recently closed Corris Railway in 1951 and named Sir Haydn and Edward Thomas respectively. Because both railways were built to the unusual gauge of [...] it was relatively easy to adapt the Corris locomotives to work on the Talyllyn. No.3 became the first new locomotive to travel on the railway for over 80years in 1951, but it frequently derailed, and on inspection {{it turned out that the}} Talyllyn track was laid approximately half an inch (13mm) wider than the official gauge, a deliberate policy by the old company to accommodate the long wheelbase of Talyllyn. Both Talyllyn and Dolgoch had unusually wide <b>wheel</b> <b>treads</b> that allowed them to stay on the wide-of-gauge track. This problem was eventually cured by relaying the railway to its correct gauge and altering Talyllyns trailing wheels to allow them to swivel horizontally, shortening the locomotive's fixed wheelbase. No.4 was unserviceable when it arrived, but John Alcock, the chairman of the Hunslet Engine Company, was a member of the Preservation Society and had No.4 overhauled free of charge at his works. No.4 then began service on the railway in 1952 and worked the majority of the trains that season.|$|E

Because both railways were built to the unusual gauge of [...] it was relatively easy to adapt the Corris locomotives to work on the Talyllyn Railway.

Its use was however discontinued in view of the frequent breakages of the cast-iron rails, by which the working of the line was interrupted, and accordingly horses were again employed as before.|$|E

40|$|The {{wheelset}} {{maintenance cost}} {{is an important}} part of train maintenance cost. Researchers and railway operators have been closely concerned about the way to minimize residual stress at <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> and surface roughness during wheel reprofiling, thereby reducing the wheel damage during operation, extending the wheelset service life, and cutting down wheelset maintenance cost. The present study involves dynamic simulation of tread reprofiling process by building a finite element model of wheel reprofiling, taking the wheel steel as research object. This paper makes a comprehensive analysis of surface roughness and residual stress distribution of <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> under different milling parameters. The simulation results indicate that the increase in cutting speed and back cutting depth causes the chip morphology to change while impairing the machined surface quality. Once serrated chip occurs, it means <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> machining quality deteriorates remarkably. In this way, the paper associates macroscopic chip morphology with microcosmic surface roughness and internal residual stress to provide theoretical basis for optimization of wheel reprofiling process...|$|R
5000|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognised}} that conical wheels and rails that are sloped by the same amount follow curves better than cylindrical wheels and vertical rails.

50|$|If, {{however, the}} {{wheelset}} is displaced to one side, the diameters of {{the regions of}} contact, and hence the tangential velocities of the wheels at the running surfaces are different and the wheelset tends to steer back towards the centre. Also, when the train encounters an unbanked turn, the wheelset displaces laterally slightly, so that the outer <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> speeds up linearly, and the inner <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> slows down, causing the train to turn the corner.

40|$|Roughness (corrugation, waviness) on {{the tread}} of a rolling railway wheel leads to {{vibrations}} in wheels, bogies and superstructure {{and also in}} rails, sleepers and roadbed. These vibrating components radiate noise to the surroundings. A lowering of the noise levels from tread braked freight cars is of utmost importance {{for the future of}} rail traffic. The thermomechanical interaction between brake block and <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> during braking has been found to cause hot spots on the <b>wheel</b> <b>tread.</b> This phenomenon is believed to be a main contributor {{to the development of a}} wavy tread surface. Due to thermal expansion of the rim material, the hot spots will protrude from the <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> and be more exposed to wear during the wheel/block contact than the rest of the tread surface. The non-even wear results in roughness on the <b>tread</b> of the <b>wheel</b> after cooling.

50|$|The wheel diameter(tread) reduces due {{to brake}} {{application}} as the brake blocks rub against the <b>wheel</b> <b>tread.</b> Over {{a period of}} time, the wheel diameter reduces up to 819 mm. 819mm is the condemnation diameter for the wheels.
