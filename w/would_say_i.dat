And I <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> {{was impressed}} by Dizzy Gillespie {{when he was with}} Cab Calloway. I {{was impressed by}} those three trumpet players of the people I saw in person... I thought Harry Edison and Dizzy Gillespie were the most unique of the trumpet players I heard.|$|E
500|$|On 11 November 2005, he and Rupert Grint {{presented}} Liz Carnell {{with the}} Daily Mirrors Pride of Britain Award {{for all of}} her work {{to raise awareness of}} the dangers of bullying. Felton worked on Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix throughout 2006. Having read more of the Harry Potter books, Felton reflected: [...] "I have had input into Draco. If they give me a line and I do not think it is something he <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> <b>I</b> suggest changing it. They do listen to you and you do feel a part of it." ...|$|E
500|$|Cody crafted {{the story}} to follow a night that ends in a tragic fire, after which Jennifer is kidnapped and set up as a {{sacrifice}} which goes awry. Jennifer, now possessed by a demon and subsequently altered into a succubus, sets out on a bloody rampage in which she devours boys, and {{it is up to}} Needy to stop her. In sort of a reversal aspect of how puberty changes a girl's life, Jennifer must consume the blood of others once a month or she becomes weak and plain-looking. [...] "It's a meek shall inherit the Earth sort of thing. I think it's always really satisfying and cathartic to see a character that was previously bullied become super human", said Cody. Cody said the script is not a reflection of any part of her own life, but that she is more like character Needy. [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> was more of a Needy than a Jennifer. I was never an Alpha female, and I've never gotten off with bullying other people", she said. [...] "If I had to choose, I was definitely the one being shoved, not the one shoving." ...|$|E

500|$|Tarwater {{was raised}} in a Christian home, but growing up he [...] "sort of went through the motions" [...] and didn't really hold strong beliefs. By college, he had {{abandoned}} any pretense of faith. [...] He later said that [...] "the Olympics had become an idol in my life." [...] After not making the Olympics in 2008, he met Doug Banister who challenged Tarwater to re-examine his worldview. [...] "The 'A-ha' moments were many," [...] Tarwater later recalled. [...] "y the time I had the ability to prayerfully repent and rebuke the stuff in my life, I was finally at a good time in life.... I <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> recommitted my life because I grew up in a Christian home, but really {{it was the first time}} where I knew what I was doing and committed my life to Christ." [...] Tarwater credits his Christian faith for helping him get through the ups and downs of being a competitive swimmer. On his 2012 Olympic experience, he said [...] "It was a real gift from God. [...] I felt His presence so much the past few weeks. [...] It was an unbelievable feeling." [...] Tarwater attends Hope Community Church in Charlotte.|$|E

2500|$|Tutu {{came out}} in support of {{assisted}} dying on July 2014, stating that life shouldn't be preserved [...] "at any cost". He also said that laws that deny the right to assisted dying deprive those who are dying of their [...] "human right to dignity". He gave the example of Nelson Mandela, whose long and painful illness was in his opinion [...] "an affront to Madiba's dignity". Tutu stated that {{in a similar situation}} he would not want to have his own life [...] "prolonged artificially", saying [...] "I {{think a lot of people}} would be upset if I said I wanted assisted dying. I <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't mind actually." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1972, {{soon after}} {{his return to the}} United States, Spitz landed several lucrative {{corporate}} endorsement contracts. [...] He earned about $7 million in a two-year period. [...] However, as the memory of his feats receded, so did his endorsement and promotional deals. [...] As his endorsements faded he started a successful real-estate company in Beverly Hills. He bought a Ferrari and says he made more than $1 million. [...] "A million dollars in 1972 would be equivalent to more than $10 million today," [...] Spitz said. [...] "I did very well, thank you very much." [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> was a pioneer. There wasn't anyone who'd gone to the Olympics before me who capitalized the same way on opportunity. It depends on timing, it depends on hype, it depends on the economy, and most importantly, it depends on looks. I mean, I've never seen a magazine of uglies. That's our society. I'm not saying it's right. That's just the facts." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album gained media {{attention}} for its explicit themes and exploration of homosexuality, suggested as a [...] "queer-studies thesis." [...] Singapore law officials banned the album {{due to its}} lyrics supporting homosexuality. [...] "Free Xone" [...] speaks of gay, lesbian and bisexual pairings, as Jackson protests discrimination. [...] "Together Again" [...] recalls a departed friend lost to AIDS. Her cover of Rod Stewart's [...] "Tonight's the Night" [...] suggests losing her virginity to another woman, also alluding to bisexuality. Media attention led Stewart to announce [...] "that's an original song by Janet Jackson" [...] when performed in concerts. In response to criticism, Jackson said, [...] "I {{have a lot of}} gay friends, men and women, and that's why I did it. I knew people <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> was gay, and I didn't care." [...] She also stated, [...] "I caught a lot of hell for that... religious groups have been upset with me for certain songs on the album, but it’s not going to stop me from writing what I feel inside." [...] Media reports of Jackson involved in intimate relationships with dancers Tina Landon and Shawnette Heard surfaced following its release, although denied.|$|E
2500|$|Meyer {{decided to}} include the {{pregnancy}} in her story while she was researching vampires, early in 2003, and came across {{the legend of the}} incubus, a demon who could father children. Bella's insistence to not let her child die was inspired by Meyer's reaction when asked if she would let one of her children die so she could live, which was to deliver the child no matter what the consequences were. Meyer {{said in an interview with}} Shannon Hale, published in , that the birth scene published is a little less grotesque than the one she wrote before editing due to her editor, agent and publisher's requests to [...] "tone down the violence a little". She stated that Bella's pregnancy and childbirth, for her, were [...] "a way to kind of explore that concept of what childbirth used to be" [...] in the past and acknowledged that they were [...] "taking Bella in a new direction that wasn't [...] relatable for a lot of people." [...] Concerning the subject of the relatability of Bella, Meyer admitted that she lost some of her relatability to the character when she became a vampire and said, [...] "every point up until that point in the story [...] I <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> could step into this story right here and I could do everything she could do which made it really fun." [...] Meyer wanted to experience Bella's vampiric experiences and [...] "enjoyed very much" [...] writing about them and wanted to end the book from her perspective, but still thought it was [...] "a little bit harder" [...] as she couldn't step in into the story anymore.|$|E

2500|$|Ringer was not {{selected}} in the first 4 rounds of the draft, where he was projected to go by some. Instead, Ringer was selected by the Tennessee Titans in the 5th round of the 2009 NFL Draft, 173rd overall, the 11th RB taken overall. At the time of being drafted, {{he was one of}} eight Running Backs on the Titans roster. Terry McCormick of the Nashville City Paper, when grading the Titans draft, gave the Ringer pick an [...] "A". Ringer said on his Twitter page about being drafted “Titans! I can’t tell you how excited I am!”. He was the first (and only) MSU player drafted this year. Ringer said of his future pro career, [...] "I definitely have something to prove with me showing that I am just as good, if not better, than a lot of the running backs that went above me. I don't want {{to be one of those}} running backs who is titled as, He was a good running back in college and went to the NFL and became a bust. I want to make sure I continue to be called a great running back also in the NFL." [...] He mentioned of where he would fit in, [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> fit in pretty well. I know Chris Johnson is kind of like the super-fast one, and LenDale White is like the really big one. I would kind of be in the middle." [...] Ringer is expected to [...] play special teams and operate as a third-down back. Ringer said of the running back situation in Tennessee, [...] "I feel very confident in my abilities. I feel like I'm definitely going to learn a lot from the vets. I'm very happy to be in a room with LenDale White and Chris Johnson. I'm going to make sure to play my role and push them in practice. I'm also going to make sure I ... continue to do what I can do to help Tennessee." [...] Because 23 was taken by Donnie Nickey, Ringer was assigned #3, a number normally prohibited for use by running backs. He kept the number until early August, when he switched to number 21.|$|E
