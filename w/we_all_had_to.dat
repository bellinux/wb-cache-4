500|$|Aside from touring, Korn also {{released}} three singles {{following the}} album's release. [...] "No Place to Hide" [...] was the album's first single. The single features the song [...] "Proud", {{a song that}} was previously unreleased. Other versions include both original and remixed versions of songs featured on Korn.]. Amazon. Retrieved 2010-02-20. The song [...] "A.D.I.D.A.S." [...] was released as a single on March 4, 1997. The song's music video was directed by Joseph Kahn. Reginald [...] "Fieldy" [...] Arvizu said that [...] "It {{was one of the}} hardest videos we ever made because <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> lie still on cold metal slabs for hours, pretending to be dead. We wore dirty blue contacts in our eyes that made us partially blind while they were in." ...|$|E
500|$|The user {{interface}} design (UI) for The Last of Us underwent various different iterations throughout development. User interface designer Alexandria Neonakis {{originally intended to}} integrate the weapon upgrade system into the weapon slotting system, in order to constantly remind players to upgrade their weapons. Upon further iterations, Neonakis discovered that this integration resulted in a cluttered interface. Ultimately, {{it was decided that}} the upgrade system would be integrated in the form of upgrade benches, occasionally found throughout the game's world; this also solved another problem that Neonakis witnessed, in which players would upgrade to the lowest possible option, as opposed to saving parts for the higher options. Once it was decided to split the upgrade and slotting systems, the initial design was to select the weapons from a circle. This design, eventually considered [...] "clunky and slow", was replaced in preference of a list system. Neonakis has identified that the main problem with the list design was that it forced players to focus on navigating through menus during intense combat. This led to the final design, which allows players to swap and slot weapons in the same menu. To integrate the UI into the game, Neonakis separated the individual elements and changed their format. User interface programmer Paul Burg provided Neonakis with tools to move elements using their coordinates. All animated transitions were hard coded, which led to difficulty in creating smooth transitions. [...] "This was tedious and at times incredibly frustrating, but it also meant that <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be pretty creative in how things were designed," [...] Neonakis said. The game's crafting system was implemented into immediate gameplay, in order for players to feel involved. [...] "We needed to make it streamlined and fast enough that you felt like you could take just that moment and be able to craft that thing that's going to mean your survival in the next thirty seconds, or your failure to survive," [...] lead game designer Jacob Minkoff said.|$|E

We had a great year were we made like a hundred songs. Nobody’s ever heard that stuff. But once it went public, everything was different.

M. d'Aubepine appeared, and was quite cheerful, for she figured to herself once more that her husband was only detained by his duties and his value to his Prince, and was burning every moment to see his little ones. She asked questions about him, and became radiant when she heard of his courage at Lens, and the compliments that M. le Prince had paid to him.|$|E
60|$|DEAR JOHN,--Your {{letter of}} June 19 arrived {{just one day}} after {{we ought to have}} been in Elmira, N. Y. for the summer: but at the last moment the baby was seized with scarlet fever. I had to {{telegraph}} and countermand the order for special sleeping car; and in fact <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> fly around in a lively way and undo the patient preparations of weeks--rehabilitate the dismantled house, unpack the trunks, and so on. A couple of days later, the eldest child was taken down with so fierce a fever that she was soon delirious--not scarlet fever, however. Next, I myself was stretched on the bed with three diseases at once, and all of them fatal. But I never did care for fatal diseases if I could only have privacy and room to express myself concerning them.|$|E
60|$|Sir James, meantime, had heartily shaken {{the hand}} which, though begrimed at the moment, Harold held out to him, and plunged into {{inquiries}} at once, not letting him go again; for Harold, with the intuition {{that nothing was}} idly asked, and that each observation told, answered to the point as no man could do better, or in fewer words. When the round was over, and Eustace was prepared with the carriage to drive the grandees the mile up to Arghouse, Sir James returned his thanks, but {{he was going to}} walk up with Mr. Harold Alison, who was going to show him his workmen's reading-room, cottages, &c. Eustace looked about for someone to whom to resign the reins, but in vain, and <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> set off, my housewifely mind regretting that time and Eustace had combined to make the luncheon a hot instead of a cold one.|$|E

There they were on the deck, and had to be driven back again; and we set about the work like Englishmen and honest men and, thanks to our pikes and axes, we had not very much trouble about it; especially when we once became fairly angered, on seeing some of our friends undone by the heathen.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Greene said nothing, but I {{could see}} that his eyes were as anxiously fixed on {{what was going on}} as were those of his wife. At last, however, the three Greens were in the boat, as also were all the packages. Then I {{followed}} them, my portmanteau having gone down before me, and we pushed off for Bellaggio. Up to this period most of the attendants around us had understood a word or two of English, but now it would be well if we could find some one to whose ears French would not be unfamiliar. As regarded Mr. Greene and his wife, they, I found, must give up all conversation, as they knew nothing of any language but their own. Sophonisba could make herself understood in French, and was quite at home, as she assured me, in German. And then the boat was beached on the shore at Bellaggio, and <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> go again to work with the object of getting ourselves lodged at the hotel which overlooks the water.|$|E

6000|$|My call thrilled everybody. Vern spurred {{his horse}} and took to the right. Teague advised that we climb the slope. So we made for the timber. Once there {{we had to get}} off and climb on foot. It was steep, rough, very hard work. I had on chaps and spurs. Soon I was hot, laboring, and my heart began to hurt. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> rest. The baying of the hounds inspirited us now and then, but {{presently}} we lost it. Teague said they had gone over the ridge and as soon as we got up to the top we would hear them again. We struck an elk trail with fresh elk tracks in it. Teague said they were just ahead of us. I never climbed so hard and fast in my life. We were all tuckered out when we {{reached the top of the}} ridge. Then to our great disappointment we did not hear the hounds. Mounting we rode along the crest of this wooded ridge toward the western end, which was considerably higher. Once on a bare patch of ground we saw where the grizzly had passed. The big, round tracks, toeing in a little, made a chill go over me. No doubt of its being a silvertip! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{very nice}} of you," [...] replied the Woman of the World, [...] "and shows more tact than I should have given you credit for. It could, as you say, have been only twenty-three years ago. I know I was a very little girl at the time. I think {{there must be some}} subtle {{connection}} between clothes and thought. I cannot imagine men in those trousers and Dundreary whiskers talking as you fellows are talking now, any more than I could conceive of a woman in a crinoline and a poke bonnet smoking a cigarette. I think it must be so, because dear mother used to be the most easy-going woman in the world in her ordinary clothes, and would let papa smoke all over the house. But about once every three weeks she would put on a hideous old-fashioned black silk dress, that looked as if Queen Elizabeth must have slept in it during one of those seasons when she used to go about sleeping anywhere, and then <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> sit up. 'Look out, ma's got her black silk dress on,' came to be a regular formula. We could always make papa take us out for a walk or a drive by whispering it to him." ...|$|E

Griff afterwards declared churchgoing {{to be as good as}} a comedy, and <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> learn to avoid meeting each other's eyes, whatever we might hear. When the scuffle and tramp of the departing congregation had ceased, we came forth from our sable box, and beheld the remnants of a once handsome church, mauled in every possible way, green stains on the walls, windows bricked up, and a huge singing gallery. Good bits of carved stall work were nailed anyhow into the pews; the floor was uneven; no font was visible; there was a mouldy uncared-for look about everything. The curate in riding-boots came out of the vestry,--a pale, weary-looking man, painfully meek and civil, with gray hair sleeked round his face. He 'louted low,' and seemed hardly to venture on taking the hand my father held out to him. There was some attempt to enter into conversation with him, but he begged to be excused, for he had to hurry back to Wattlesea to a funeral. Poor man! he was as great a pluralist as his vicar, for he kept a boys' school, partially day, partially boarding, and his eyes looked hungrily at Martyn.|$|E
