40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{algorithm}} {{to detect a}} chain of cooperative malicious node in ad-hoc network that disrupts transmission of data by feeding <b>wrong</b> <b>routing</b> information along with the detection algorithm. We also propose a mechanism to detect and remove the black and gray hole attacks. Our technique is based on sending data in terms of equal but small sized blocks instead of sending whole of data in one continuous stream. The flow of message is monitored independently at the neighborhood of both source and destination. The result of monitoring is gathered by a backbone network of trusted nodes. Our algorithm takes O(n) time on average to find the chain of malicious nodes which is better than earlier O(n 2) time bound for detecting a single black hole network...|$|E
40|$|QoS routing is {{considered}} a very promising method for enhancing integrated services networks performance and possibly one of the enabling techniques for the deployment of the future Internet, where heterogeneous multimedia traffic flows should coexist. However, benefits of QoS routing are often questioned, mainly {{on the basis of}} the additional costs (both in term of computing complexity and increased signaling), and the risk that stale information about the network status may lead to <b>wrong</b> <b>routing</b> decisions. This paper analyzes the impact of out-of-date information on several QoS routing algorithms, either taken from the literature or newly proposed by the authors. The latter are devised with the explicit aim of providing robust QoS algorithms that also reduce computing complexity. Routing algorithms introduced in this paper are based on the notion of Multimetric Sequential Filtering (MSF). MSF splits a (generally intractable) multimetric constraint-based routing problem in a [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Bloom filter (BF) is a space-efficient data {{structure}} {{that represents a}} large set of items and supports efficient membership queries. It has been widely proposed to employ Bloom filters in the routing entries so as to facilitate data-centric routing in network applications. The existing designs of Bloom filters, however, cannot effectively support in-network queries. Given a query for a data item at a node in the network, the noise in unrelated routing entries very likely equals to the useful information of the item in the right routing entries. Consequently, the majority of queries are routed towards many wrong nodes besides those destinations, wasting large quantities of network traffic. To address this issue, we classified the existing designs as CUBF (Cumulative Bloom filters) and ABF (Aggregated Bloom filters), and then evaluate their performance in routing queries under the noisy environments. Based on the evaluation results, we propose a receiver-oriented design of Bloom filters to sufficiently restrict {{the probability of a}} <b>wrong</b> <b>routing</b> decision. Moreover, we significantly decrease the delay of a routing decision in the case of CUBF by using the bit slice approach, and reduce the transmission size of each BF in the case of ABF by using the compression approach. Both the theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that our receiver-oriented design of Bloom filters apparently outperforms the existing approaches in terms of the success probability of routing and network traffic cost.

60|$|From {{the first}} the voyage was going <b>wrong.</b> <b>Routed</b> {{out of my}} hotel on a bitter March morning, I had crossed Baltimore and reached the pier-end {{precisely}} on time. At nine o'clock the tug was to have taken me down the bay and put me on board the Elsinore, and with growing irritation I sat frozen inside my taxicab and waited. On the seat, outside, the driver and Wada sat hunched in a temperature perhaps half a degree colder than mine. And there was no tug.|$|R

Paisley Canal station did the same; and so did Elderslie. Right out at the cow's tail and getting all the wag, the {{distinguished}} party had a pretty stormy trip {{all the way to}} Ayr, at which point the murder of Coutts was strongly advocated. But when they found that Coutts had actually lost a minute to Paisley, they began to think something must be <b>wrong</b> with the <b>routing,</b> so the 5.10 was altered to run via the Glasgow and Paisley Joint Line, which was at least straight.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Different {{geographic}} {{routing protocols}} have different requirements on routing metric designs to ensure proper operation. Combining a <b>wrong</b> type of <b>routing</b> metric with a geographic routing protocol may produce unexpected results, such as geographic routing loops and unreachable nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel routing algebra system {{to investigate the}} compatibilities between routing metrics and three geographic routing protocols including greedy, face and combined-greedyface routing. Four important algebraic properties, respectively named odd symmetry, transitivity, source independence and local minimum freeness, are defined in this algebra system. Based on these algebraic properties, the necessary and sufficient conditions for loop-free and delivery guaranteed routing are derived when greedy, face and combined-greedy-face routing serve as packet forwarding schemes or as path discovery algorithms respectively. Our work provides essential criterions for evaluating and designing geographic routing protocols. Index Terms—geographic routing, routing algebra, loopfreeness, delivery guarantee. I...|$|R
40|$|Wireless body area {{networks}} are {{wireless sensor networks}} whose adoption has recently emerged and spread in important healthcare applications, such as the remote monitoring of health conditions of patients. A major issue associated with the deployment of such networks is represented by energy consumption: in general, the batteries of the sensors cannot be easily replaced and recharged, so containing the usage of energy by a rational design of the network and of the routing is crucial. Another issue is represented by traffic uncertainty: body sensors may produce data at a variable rate that is not exactly known in advance, for example because the generation of data is event-driven. Neglecting traffic uncertainty may lead to <b>wrong</b> design and <b>routing</b> decisions, which may compromise the functionality of the network and have very bad effects {{on the health of}} the patients. In order to address these issues, in this work we propose the first robust optimization model for jointly optimizing the topology and the routing in body area networks under traffic uncertainty. Since the problem may result challenging even for a state-of-the-art optimization solver, we propose an original optimization algorithm that exploits suitable linear relaxations to guide a randomized fixing of the variables, supported by an exact large variable neighborhood search. Experiments on realistic instances indicate that our algorithm performs better than a state-of-the-art solver, fast producing solutions associated with improved optimality gaps.
