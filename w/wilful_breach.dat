Her father had {{intended}} her to marry a Danish nobleman, the future High Justiciar David Thorsteinsen. Folke Algotsson, a knight from Gothenland (and, according to myth, a descendent of Algaut), abducted her {{with the help of}} some of his brothers and fled with her to Norway. King Magnus III, reportedly livid about the <b>wilful</b> <b>breach</b> of women's safety in convents, had {{one of the}} brothers executed.|$|E

After {{being placed on}} the list of endangered World Heritage Sites in 2006, the city had its status as world heritage site formally removed in June 2009, for the <b>wilful</b> <b>breach</b> of the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, due to the construction of a highway bridge across the valley within 2 km of the historic centre. The [...] "Free State of Saxony" [...] is responsible for the destruction of this unique cultural landscape. It thereby became the first location ever in Europe to lose this status, and the second ever in the world.|$|E

Examples include insanity, permanent incapacity, one partner's conduct which a court finds detrimental to the business, <b>wilful</b> or persistent <b>breach</b> of the partnership agreement, or whenever a court finds dissolution of the partnership to be just and equitable.|$|R
40|$|This article {{seeks to}} trace the {{evolution}} of equity’s jurisdiction to relieve against the forfeiture of leases from the early 17 th century cases through {{to the present day}} in the United Kingdom jurisdiction. Although the celebrated case of Sanders v Pope, decided in 1806, marked a trend towards a more flexible (discretionary) approach to equitable relief, this was to be short lived following Lord Eldon’s judgment in Hill v Barclay in 1811 declining to grant relief against forfeiture of a lease for a <b>wilful</b> <b>breach</b> of covenant not involving the failure to pay rent even where the same was capable of adequate compensation. This remained the position until 1973, when the House of Lords in Shiloh Spinners Ltd v Harding took the opportunity to review the whole question of the scope of equity’s jurisdiction to relieve against forfeitures. What emerged was a principled approach to the grant of equitable relief which was not limited to the two orthodox heads of relief: (a) where the right to forfeit was inserted by way of security for the payment of rent and (b) where the breach had been occasioned by fraud, accident, mistake or surprise. The Shiloh ruling {{paved the way for the}} granting of relief for breaches of other covenants in the same way as that in the case of rent, namely, to prevent a forfeiture where the landlord may be adequately compensated and receive proper undertakings as to future performance, so that the forfeiture clause is merely security to achieve these results. The article also examines the current scope of equity’s jurisdiction to relieve against forfeiture given that the court’s statutory power to grant relief has been gradually extended in the landlord and tenant context from the single case of non-payment of rent till it has reached its present dimensions of a broadly based jurisdiction to relieve against virtually all forms of default by the tenant, sub-tenant or mortgagee. What emerges is a more limited, but no less significant, equitable power to grant relief outside the court’s statutory jurisdiction. In jurisprudential terms, it is argued, equity’s ability to prevent the unconscionable exercise of legal rights remains at the heart of our common law tradition...|$|E
40|$|Verifikation ist ein Prozess, durch den sich die an einem internationalen Abkommen beteiligten Staaten ein bestimmtes Mass an Gewissheit verschaffen wollen, ob ihre Partner die Regelungen eines Abkommens befolgen oder nicht. In den Verhandlungen zur Klimarahmenkonvention (KRK) spielte die Verfikation keine bedeutsame Rolle. Das lag u. a. daran, dass die Regelungstiefe der KRK als zu gering erachtet wurde, um absichtliche Vertragsverstoesse zu provozieren. Um aber Perspektiven fuer die Verifikation zu eroeffnen, wurde in der KRK die Grundlage fuer ein Verifikationssystem geschaffen: Die KRK verpflichtet die Vertragsstaaten, regelmaessig Nationalberichte zu erstellen, in denen sie ihre Emissionsentwicklung und zum Klimaschutz ergriffene Massnahmen dokumentieren. Diese Berichtspflicht wurde 1994 noch durch ein Ueberpruefungsverfahren ergaenzt. Somit war zumindest die technische Stufe der Verifikation im Klimaregime institutionell ausgestaltet. Da aber das Stabilisierungsziel in der KRK zu vage formuliert ist und als nicht rechtlich verbindlich gilt, konzentriert sich die Ueberpruefung der Einhaltung von Pflichten auf die Nationalberichte der Staaten: Neben der rein formalen Feststellung, dass Nationalberichte uebermittelt wurden, findet auch eine inhaltliche Ueberpruefung der Angaben in den Berichten durch Experten statt. Dazu gehoert, ob die Staaten wirklich die Politiken und Massnahmen zum Klimaschutz umsetzen, die sie im Bericht angegeben haben. Eine Ueberpruefung beschraenkt sich hier jedoch auf eine reine Implementierungskontrolle. Ausserdem werden die quantitativen Daten ueber die Treibhausgasemissionen ueberprueft, wobei aufgrund der Eigenschaften dieser Verifikationsobjekte nur festgestellt werden kann, ob die Daten vollstaendig und plausibel erscheinen, nicht aber, ob sie 'richtig' sind. (orig.) Verification is {{a process}} {{established}} by the parties to an international convention, intended to yield information about the degree of compliance of the parties with {{the provisions of the}} convention. At the time when the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change was negotiated, compliance control and verification were not so important issues, because the regulatory provisions of the FCCC were considered to be of a low compulsory nature, and hence would not provoke <b>wilful</b> <b>breach</b> of contract. The basis for a compliance control regime however was laid at the time, in order {{to pave the way for}} a verification regime to be negotiated in a later phase: The FCCC obliges the parties to the Convention to prepare and submit at regular intervals documentation reporting their activities for emissions mitigation and protection of the global climate. This obligation to render account was supplemented in 1994 by more specific provisions governing the regime and procedures for verification of compliance. Thus, at least the general legal setting and the institutional framework were created, which however were weakened by rather vague formulations of the primary goal, i. e. to halt continuing growth of emissions, on a legally not binding basis at that, so that compliance control was reduced to screening the national reports of the states. The contribution here explains the oversight procedure applied, checking reporting intervals and contents of reports by experts. The contents include implementation activities, and information on quantities and omposition of greenhouse gas emissions, whicomposition of greenhouse gas emissions whichh is he ked for plausibility and ompleteness, but not for 'a urateness'.
