40|$|This paper {{presents}} a laboratory scale experimental technique {{to study the}} performance of the encapsulated sand barrier systems in mitigating shock waves. The geotextile encapsulated sand barrier systems are made of cubical <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> formwork <b>lined</b> with geotextile and form a thick protective barrier when filled with granular materials. In the present study, dry sand particles of size varying from microns to few millimeters (fine and coarse) are used as infill granular material. Spherical shaped glass beads are also used as the infill material to study the influence of shape of the infill particle on the attenuation behavior. The process of shock wave attenuation by the sand barrier, with and without the geotextile facing formwork is examined. The experiments are performed using a conventional shock tube, where shock waves with incident Mach number in the range of 129 - 1. 70 are generated. The experimental results show that the presence of geotextile layer has contributed significantly towards shock wave attenuation. The geotextile also plays an important role as a regulator, which is able to deliver gradual pressure rise at the downstream end of the barrier. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

Combustor {{was made from}} quartz glass tube with an inner diameter of 3, 5 mm and an outer diameter of 5 mm. Two pieces of <b>wire</b> <b>meshes</b> were made from stainless steel inserted at 10 and 13 mm {{from the end of}} combustor. Propane was used as fuel in this research. Flame was stabilized in the region between two <b>wire</b> <b>meshes.</b> The flame has a blue luminosity, indicate no soot formation condition. However, the second <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> and combustor wall has red luminousity at high velocity reactant, indicate that they have high temperature and emmited heat radiation. Meso-scale combustor with double <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> has broader flame stability area if compared to combustor with single <b>wire</b> <b>mesh.</b> Extention of this region occured toward lower equivalence ratio for lean fuel mixture, as well as toward higher equivalence ratio for rich fuel mixture. The most important extention region of flame stability area is toward higher reactant flow rate. It was caused by existing of second <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> which has function to prevent occurence of blow–off at relatively high reactant flow rate, as well as to increase heat recirculation to unburnt reactant as a results of higher wall temperature...|$|R

40|$|<b>Wire</b> <b>mesh</b> dampers {{are under}} {{investigation}} {{because they are}} seen as replacements for squeeze film dampers {{as a source of}} direct stiffness and damping at bearing locations. There are several advantages of <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> dampers over squeeze film dampers, including: temperature insensitivity, oil-free operation, and the ability to contain large amplitude vibrations. Furthermore, due to their direct damping and lack of cross-coupled stiffness, the <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> reduces the response to imbalance and increases the stability of the system. The objective of this research was to determine the properties of <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> dampers under large amplitude vibrations. Impact testing was first conducted on the <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> as a means of obtaining the large amplitudes that were of interest. Next, to verify the results, a second methodology was employed using shaker testing. It was found that both the stiffness and hysteretic damping decrease with increasing displacement. However, they both approached asymptotes around 2 mils of displacement, and further increases in displacement had significantly less effect on the properties. Once the results were verified to be consistent, equations were obtained to describe the response of the <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> dampers. These equations were then used to create a new design workbook, which would allow an engineer to determine the properties of <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> dampers under conditions that they might experience...|$|R

Their capability to provide damping for a wide range of temperatures (even cryogenic), fluid free operation and ability to perform even when soaked with lubricants makes them a suitable option as a bearing damper. Experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of design parameters like axial thickness and axial compression that influence the characteristics of <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> as a bearing damper. Two groups of <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> were tested to show that the stiffness and damping are directly proportional to the axial thickness, if all the other parameters are kept constant.

40|$|Abstract — Corrugated <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> {{laminates}} (CWML) are a {{class of}} engineered open cell structures that have potential for applications in many areas including aerospace and biomedical engineering. Two different methods of fabricating corrugated <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> laminates from stainless steel, one using a high temperature Lithobraze alloy and the other using a low temperature Eutectic solder for joining the corrugated <b>wire</b> <b>meshes</b> are described herein. Their implementation is demonstrated by manufacturing CWML samples of 304 and 316 stainless steel (SST). It is seen that due to the facility of employing <b>wire</b> <b>meshes</b> of different densities and wire diameters, {{it is possible to}} create CWML laminates {{with a wide range of}} effective densities. The fabricated laminates are tested under uniaxial compression. The variation of the compressive yield strength with relative density of the CWML is compared to the theory developed by Gibson and Ashby for open cell structures [22].

The hexagonal <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> specimens with 80 x 100 mm cell sizes were pulled {{at a rate of}} 1 mm/min. In the conventional pullout test wherein the clamping system is outside the pullout box, the deformation and movement of hexagonal <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> known as necking phenomenon occurred simultaneously during the pullout process. In order to reduce this phenomenon, the large pullout test was modified to install the clamping system inside the pullout box hereinafter called “in-soil pullout test”. The total pullout resistance of hexagonal <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> reinforcement consists of two components, namely: friction and bearing resistance. An elastic-perfectly plastic model was used to simulate the friction resistance and relative displacement relation of hexagonal <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> while a hyperbolic model was applied to simulate the passive bearing resistance of the individual bearing member. The bearing resistance is approximately 4 to 6 times greater than the friction resistance.
