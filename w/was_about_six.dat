5|$|Tropical Depression Nine caused minor {{flooding}} in Central America in September2001. The ninth tropical cyclone of the 2001 Atlantic hurricane season, the depression developed from a tropical wave {{in the southwestern}} Caribbean Sea on September19. Without significant intensification, the depression made landfall in Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua early on September20, which <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>six</b> hours after becoming a tropical cyclone. Once inland over Central America, the depression significant deteriorated and dissipated later that day, after lasting for less than 24hours. The remnants emerged into the Pacific Ocean and later developed into Hurricane Juliette. Impact from the depression was rather minor. Although sustained winds on land did not exceed 30mph (55km/h), a fallen tree injured three children in El Salvador. In addition, heavy rainfall flooded at least 200homes in San Salvador and inundated 15farms. The depression {{did not result in}} fatalities and damage caused by it is unknown.|$|E

Prisoners were held in the cargo holds where criminals ruled; the guards stayed outside and above and would spray the holds with ice-cold ocean water if things became too unruly. Women prisoners were abused.|$|E

25|$|When she <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>six</b> years old, Edith and {{her sister}} Mary were sent to Romsey Abbey, near Southampton in {{southern}} England, where their maternal aunt Cristina was abbess. During her stay at Romsey and, some time before 1093, at Wilton Abbey, both institutions known for learning, the Scottish princess was much sought-after as a bride; refusing proposals from William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey, and Alan Rufus, Lord of Richmond. Hériman of Tournai claimed that William Rufus considered marrying her. Her education went beyond the standard feminine pursuits. This was not surprising as {{her mother was a}} great lover of books.

25|$|Dot Robinson {{was born}} April 22, 1912 in Australia. James Goulding, Robinson's father, was a {{motorcyclist}} {{who worked as}} a sidecar designer and an amateur racer. When Robinson <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>six</b> years old her father moved him and his family to the United States in 1918 in hopes to expand his sidecar designing business. Robinson was almost destined to ride a motorcycle because Robinson's father was into the business and ran a motorcycle dealership, so at a young age Robinson became well acquainted with operating a bike. In high school Dot met her future husband Earl who she would eventually marry in 1931 and together they partook in multiple races. Dot entered herself in a Jack Pine National Endurance Championship in 1934, and by 1940 she won Jack Pine and became known as the first woman to win an AMA national competition. In 1935 Harley-Davidson asked Dot and her high school sweetheart, Earl, to run a dealership. Shortly after Davidson requested they help him by opening a dealership the Robinsons moved to Detroit where they operated a successful Harley-Davidson dealership until 1971. Linda Dugeau and Dot Robinson met in 1940 at the Laconia national and within months the Motor Maids organization was in full motion. Dot was president of the organization and Linda secretary of the organization. The motorcyclist image was always black with leather until Dot Robinson changed the attire allowing women to continue to have their femininity. Robinson was always seen as a very classy lady and she wanted all women who were included in her organization to have the same image. The change Dot made the attire of her organization made a statement of empowerment while still feminine. When the Robinsons retired from the dealership in 1971 they begin to travel together by motorcycle until Earl died I 1996. Even after Dot's husband died she continued to ride and explore until 1998 when a knee replacement slowed her down, and on October 8, 1999 Dot Robinson died at age 87.|$|E

500|$|The track {{included}} the highly compressed drums that the Beatles currently favoured, with reverse cymbals, reverse guitar, processed vocals, looped tape effects, a sitar and a tambura drone. The {{use of these}} ¼-inch audio tape loops resulted primarily from McCartney's admiration for Stockhausen's Gesang der Jünglinge. By disabling the erase head of a tape recorder and then spooling a continuous loop of tape through the machine while recording, the tape would constantly overdub itself, creating a saturation effect, a technique also used in musique concrète. The tape could also be induced to go faster and slower. McCartney encouraged the other Beatles {{to use the same}} effects and create their own loops. After experimentation on their own, the various Beatles supplied a total of [...] "30 or so" [...] tape loops to Martin, who selected 16 for use on the song. Each loop <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>six</b> seconds long.|$|E
