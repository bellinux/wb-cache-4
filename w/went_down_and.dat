5|$|After a {{month of}} {{classroom}} instruction in aviation, Shepard was posted to a destroyer, , in August 1944; it was US Navy policy that aviation candidates should first have some service at sea. At the time the destroyer was deployed on active service in the Pacific Ocean. Shepard joined it when it returned to the naval base at Ulithi on October 30. After just two days at sea Cogswell helped rescue 172 sailors from the cruiser , which had been torpedoed by a Japanese submarine, then escorted the crippled ship back to Ulithi. The ship was buffeted by Typhoon Cobra in December 1944, a storm in which three other destroyers <b>went</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> battled kamikazes in the invasion of Lingayen Gulf in January 1945.|$|E
25|$|After 1998, {{football}} <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> Cricket {{took the}} centre-stage for many years, drawing sell-out and high money grossing games. In fact, the highest money grosser at the venue {{was made in}} a cricket ODI match between India and its arch-rival Pakistan on April 2005. The first ODI played on this ground was between India and Australia on 1 April 1998.|$|E
25|$|The first boxing rules, {{called the}} Broughton's rules, were {{introduced}} by champion Jack Broughton in 1743 to protect fighters {{in the ring}} where deaths sometimes occurred. Under these rules, if a man <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> could not continue after a count of 30 seconds, the fight was over. Hitting a downed fighter and grasping below the waist were prohibited. Broughton encouraged the use of 'mufflers', a form of padded bandage or mitten, {{to be used in}} 'jousting' or sparring sessions in training, and in exhibition matches.|$|E

50|$|The chain {{can have}} two bends, {{so there is}} one at a pole, two on the equator and one at the {{opposite}} pole. None of the triangles of coordinating atoms and the central atom are coplanar. This is termed cis-α (alpha). This arrangement is chiral, so there are two possible mirror images. The arrangement where the chain <b>goes</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> clockwise <b>and</b> <b>down</b> is termed lambda Λ, <b>and</b> where is <b>goes</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> anticlockwise <b>and</b> <b>down</b> is called delta Δ.|$|R
25|$|After the {{suspension}} was over, NASCAR president Brian France summoned Kenseth and Logano {{for a meeting}} to resolve any further issues. Kenseth's original explanation was that a tire <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> caused him to crash into Logano, but he later admitted following his suspension that it was deliberate and had no remorse for his actions. Kenseth's actions had ultimately caused Logano to miss {{the final round of}} the Chase, due to Logano finishing badly at Texas and not winning the rain-shortened Quicken Loans Race For Heroes 500 at Phoenix.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Jones {{retained}} {{his title}} by knocking out Australian boxer Glen Kelly in seven rounds via knockout. Jones put both {{hands behind his}} back. As Kelly moved in behind a jab, Jones went over the jab with a right to the head. Kelly <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> was counted out. Jones landed 124 of 249 punches (50%) and Kelly connected on 42 of 171 (25%). Before this bout, Jones was controversially awarded The Ring Championship belt, despite Dariusz Michalczewski still being regarded as the Lineal champion in the same weight class.|$|E
25|$|The {{story of}} the Tower of Babel is meant to explain the origin of {{different}} languages. According to the story, which is recorded in , everyone on earth spoke the same language. As people migrated from the east, they settled {{in the land of}} Shinar. People there sought to make bricks and build a city and a tower with its top in the sky, {{to make a name for}} themselves, so that they not be scattered over the world. God came down to look at the city and tower, and remarked that as one people with one language, nothing that they sought would be out of their reach. God <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> confounded their speech, so that they could not understand each other, and scattered them over the face of the earth, and they stopped building the city. Thus the city was called Babel.|$|E

25|$|Utor {{made its}} {{landfall}} in Casiguran, Aurora at 3 AM (local time) on August 12. Power lines and telecommunications <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> many houses were destroyed. In Nueva Vizcaya, heavy rainfall had been recorded. Some {{residents in the}} said province were forced to evacuate due to flooding. Moreover, the Magat River in the province reached the critical level, resulting in the partial opening of four gates in a dam. Electricity was also out in the province. One man died on Baguio City {{after he had been}} buried alive after a mudslide hit his home. In Isabela, more than 100 families had been affected by Utor. About 200 million pesos in agriculture was blamed on Utor in Isabela alone. Around 1,000 residents in the central Bicol region spent the night in shelters, and 23 fishermen who were out at sea failed to return home in four towns in Catanduanes province. Some cars in North Luzon Expressway used hazard signals as roads were nearly impossible to see. Intense rainfall throughout the day had been recorded in Zambales, which created flash flooding in low lying areas. The major river on the province then overflowed, flooding homes. The flood is expected to get higher as high tide is expected in the morning. At least 700 passengers were stranded in the ports of Albay, Catanduanes, Sorsogon and Samar. Additionally, 10 flights had also been canceled as Utor brought intense rainfall in many parts of Luzon.|$|E

500|$|Alex Browning, {{the last}} role cast, went to Canadian actor Devon Sawa, who {{previously}} {{starred in the}} 1999 film Idle Hands. [...] Sawa said that when [...] " [...] read the script on a plane, [...] found [...] peeking {{out the window at}} the engine every couple of minutes" [...] and [...] " [...] <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> met Glen and Jim and [...] thought they were amazing and already had some great ideas". However, Morgan and Wong were undecided about casting him for the part, so they requested him to perform again as they reviewed his previous works. Morgan was astounded by Sawa's performance in Idle Hands, and Sawa was hired.|$|E
500|$|The D-Day {{scenes were}} shot in Ballinesker Beach, Curracloe Strand, Ballinesker, {{just east of}} Curracloe, County Wexford, Ireland. Hanks {{recalled}} to Roger Ebert that although {{he realized it was}} a movie, the experience still hit him hard, stating, [...] "The first day of shooting the D-Day sequences, I was {{in the back of the}} landing craft, and that ramp <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> I saw the first 1-2-3-4 rows of guys just getting blown to bits. In my head, of course, I knew it was special effects, but I still wasn't prepared for how tactile it was." [...] Filming began June 27, 1997, and lasted for two months. Some shooting was done in Normandy, for the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial in Colleville-sur-Mer and Calvados. Other scenes were filmed in England, such as a former British Aerospace factory in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, Thame Park, Oxfordshire and Wiltshire. Production was due to also take place in Seaham, County Durham, but government restrictions disallowed this.|$|E
500|$|Two riders very {{disappointed}} with their results were Michael Matthews and Fabian Cancellara. Matthews crashed {{at high speed}} shortly before the Cipressa and arrived at the finish with a bandaged right elbow. He said: [...] "Obviously I'm devastated. [...] This was everything, this was my world championships {{for the start of}} the season. [...] I was really looking forward to making a good finale, it's really unfortunate that a crash stopped me from doing that." [...] Cancellara, who was riding the event for the last time before retirement at the end of the 2016 season, was held up in Gaviria's crash after having stayed in the leading group. He described his final kilometres as difficult, as he had been isolated from his teammates, saying that the other riders mainly attacked him and did not work with him. Another rider who was almost involved when Gaviria fell was Peter Sagan, who confirmed that the peloton had covered Cancellara in particular. He went on to describe the moment of Gaviria's crash: [...] "Then I got away with Boasson Hagen, Gaviria and someone else. Then with about 500 metres to go, Gaviria looked around because the group was coming up. He <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> I only just managed to avoid him. I stayed up but I lost a lot speed and never managed to get going again in the final metres." ...|$|E

500|$|The British column {{arrived at}} the base of Arnold's {{barricade}} at the northern end of Ridgefield's town center sometime after noon. [...] Following an hour-long artillery barrage of the barricade, Tryon dispatched flanking parties to test both sides of the American position. Having anticipated this move, General Silliman posted forces at both flanks that blunted initial thrusts. Outnumbering the Patriot forces by more than three to one, Tryon chose to advance on all three fronts including a 600-man column under covering artillery fire against the barricade itself under the leadership of General Erskine. [...] Tryon directed General Agnew to send out flankers, whose enfilading fire helped breach the barricade. The British then pursued the Patriot forces in a running battle the length of Town Street, and gained control of the town. With 12 dead and 24 wounded, the Americans withdrew under General Arnold's orders. [...] After the barricade was breached, Arnold was positioned between his men and an advancing enemy platoon when his horse was struck by nine musket shots. [...] The horse <b>went</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> Arnold was pinned and tangled in its trappings. A British soldier charged him shouting for Arnold to surrender. [...] Arnold shouted [...] "Not Yet" [...] and shot and killed the soldier. [...] He then ran off with his troops with a slightly injured leg. [...] This entire engagement took around fifteen minutes.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{begins with a}} brief scene of an {{astronaut}} on Mars uncovering a stone slate featuring {{the cover of the}} album Oops!... I Did It Again. A scientist back on Earth sees it through a video transmitter and says, [...] "Cute. What is it?" [...] As the astronaut replies, [...] "Oh, it's cute alright. It couldn't be...", the ground begins to shake as a large stage rises from the ground. Spears then descends from a platform onto a stage in a red catsuit as the track begins to play. As she continues to sing and dance, she suspends the astronaut mid-air above her. Interspersed throughout the video are scenes of Spears wearing a short white top and skirt, lying barefoot on a white web pad with dancers on the ground around her. During its bridge, Spears does a flip in the air to where the astronaut is and appears in a white jacket, short black leather skirt, and leather boots. As a symbol of his love for her, the astronaut gifts Spears with the Heart of the Ocean, the blue diamond from the blockbuster film Titanic (1997). She questions that she [...] "thought the old lady [...] dropped it into the ocean in the end", to which he responds, [...] "Well, baby, I <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> got it for you". Spears comments [...] "Oh, you shouldn't have" [...] and walks away, the astronaut shrugs and leaves. The video concludes as Spears and her performers continue to dance.|$|E
500|$|His final race of 2016 was the Winter Challenge Stakes at Los Alamitos, {{the only}} time the horse had ever run at the track that had been his home {{training}} base. [...] In a race of a mile and a sixteenth against light competition, where he was as much as 6 horses wide, he won easily by 12 lengths and set a track record. The final race of his career was the Pegasus World Cup on January 28, 2017, where he drew the far outside post and ran a surprisingly poor race, was eased in the stretch, and finished ninth, well behind the winner, Arrogate. Arrogate's jockey, Mike Smith, commented, [...] "Chrome just didn't fire his race today at all." [...] Sherman commented [...] "This was the first bad race he has run for me." [...] The horse had fluid on his right knee after the race, and although the injury did not appear serious, Sherman theorized about the cause: [...] "It looks like he scrambled away from there and couldn't get his footing." [...] Arrogate's trainer, Bob Baffert, was also disappointed: [...] "I kept waiting for the matchup with Chrome, but he just didn't bring his race today. It's too bad." [...] X-rays taken after the race showed no bone injury, but California Chrome was a bit [...] "off" [...] in his gait. [...] Frank Taylor explained that no one knew what exactly happened, [...] "We don't know if he just wrenched it or strained it, but it had a little filling, fluid and heat in it." [...] An equine chiropractor got a small [...] "pop" [...] when he stretched out the horse's leg. Clinical signs of injury <b>went</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> he was shipped to Taylor Made Farm the next day, Sunday. By Monday he was allowed to go out and exercise in a paddock.|$|E
