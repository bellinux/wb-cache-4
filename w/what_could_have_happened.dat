40|$|Story {{understanding}} {{is a central}} competence that illuminates all other aspects of human intelligence. In this work, I demonstrate how our story understanding ability sheds light on our ability {{to think in terms}} of hypothetical situations. Using the Genesis story understanding system as a substrate, I develop a story-enabled hypothetical reasoning system that models several high-level human abilities, including judging actions in terms of moral alternatives, contextualizing stories by considering <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> otherwise <b>happened,</b> and deliberating about personality to decide what characters will do next. In developing this system, I built many new computational mechanisms and representations, including a program for answering what-if questions, a side-by-side story comparator, rules for making presumptive inferences, heuristics for evaluating personality fit, and a problem-solving approach for evaluating moral character. Together, they take Genesis's story understanding capabilities to another level and advance our understanding of human intelligence. by Dylan Alexander Holmes. Thesis: S.

Other studies, however, have suggested that a more controlled use of counterfactual thinking may reduce reference to legally irrelevant norms. These results suggest that instructions and training programmes aimed at fostering the generation and comparison of several counterfactual alternatives may improve the quality of judicial decision making...|$|R

60|$|When Asaph {{came within}} sight of his sister's house he was amazed to see a phaeton and a gray horse {{standing}} in front of the gate.

And if so, why did she send for a physician who lived at a distance, instead of Doctor McIlvaine, the village doctor? In a very anxious state of mind Asaph reached the gate, and irresolutely went into the yard. His impulse was to go to the house and see what had happened; but he hesitated. He felt that Marietta might object to having a comparative stranger know that such an exceedingly shabby fellow was her brother. And, besides, his sister <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> been overtaken by any sudden illness.

6000|$|Bernard lost {{no time in}} {{learning}} that his friend had in fact departed by the eight o'clock train--the morning was now well advanced; and then, over his breakfast, he gave himself up to meditative surprise. What <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> during the evening--what <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> after their conversation in Gordon's room? He had gone to Mrs. Vivian's--what <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> there? Bernard {{found it difficult to}} believe that he had gone there simply to notify her that, having talked it over with an intimate friend, he gave up her daughter, or to mention to the young lady herself that he had ceased to desire the honor of her hand. Gordon alluded to some definite occurrence, yet it was inconceivable that he should have allowed himself to be determined by Bernard's words--his diffident and irresponsible impression. Bernard resented this idea as an injury to himself, yet it was difficult to imagine <b>what</b> else <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened.</b> There was Gordon's word for it, however, that there was no [...] "traceable" [...] connection between the circumstances which led to his sudden departure and the information he had succeeded in extracting from his friend. What did he mean by a [...] "traceable" [...] connection? Gordon never used words idly, and he meant to make of this point an intelligible distinction. It was this sense of his usual accuracy of expression that assisted Bernard in fitting a meaning to his late companion's letter. He intended to intimate that he had come back to Baden with his mind made up to relinquish his suit, and that he had questioned Bernard simply from moral curiosity--for the sake of intellectual satisfaction. Nothing was altered by the fact that Bernard had told him a sorry tale; it had not modified his behavior--that effect would have been traceable. It had simply affected his imagination, which was a consequence of the imponderable sort. This view of the case was supported by Gordon's mention of his good spirits. A man always had good spirits when he had acted in harmony with a conviction. Of course, after renouncing the attempt to make himself acceptable to Miss Vivian, the only possible thing for Gordon had been to leave Baden. Bernard, continuing to meditate, at last convinced himself that there had been no explicit rupture, that Gordon's last visit had simply been a visit of farewell, that its character had sufficiently signified his withdrawal, and that he had now gone away because, after giving the girl up, he wished very naturally not to meet her again. This was, on Bernard's part, a sufficiently coherent view of the case; but nevertheless, an hour afterward, as he strolled along the Lichtenthal Alley, he found himself stopping suddenly and exclaiming under his breath--"Have I done her an injury? Have I affected her prospects?" [...] Later in the day he said to himself half a dozen times that he had simply warned Gordon against an incongruous union.|$|R
40|$|How) Can classic {{literary}} texts be re-read from a subversive feminist perspective? And moreover, can those texts be re-interpreted/re-written? In order {{to answer these}} questions I focus on two novels: The Penelopiad (orig. 2005), by Margaret Atwood, and Weight (orig. 2005), by Jeanette Winterson. The official version of these myths has been previously accepted as aletheia, or the truth. This feminist re-writing shows that those myths had never been properly understood and, consequently, the official version does not match what really happened (though in fiction). The first person narration to tell the stories, along with the rhetorical irony, imposes a distant perspective of those myths. Even the feminist parody in those texts reaches the classical Aristotelian poetics, which deals with the differences between the historical genre and the other genres, as well as the problem of the verisimilitude. Now, at the beginning of 21 st century, the history is suspicious: what has been accepted must be put into question. The feminist fiction makes up the events to open new interpretations highlighting areas that had remained in semi-darkness in the previous transmission. Since absolute knowledge is impossible, since forgetting is inevitable, Atwood and Winterson suggest another (way of) reading. They offer variations; and alter the perspective in the stories in order to get new insights of <b>what</b> (in fiction) <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened.</b> Regarding methodological issues, I distinguish between methods and methodology. I do not think that there are specific feminist methods, that is to say tools we use in order to construct our research. But there is definitely a feminist approach to those tools, that is a particular discourse that sustains both our methods and the relevance of our research question. This distinction between methods and methodology is useful to tackle any kind of research, as well as it allows a sort of distance in relation to the tools themselves and the approach with which those tools can be used. Therefore I used discursive analysis by means of deconstructing and questioning different instances. At the same time that applying one methodology, I intend to show how a certain methodology, any methodology is in fact, always used in the very process of making fiction. In terms of epistemology, meaning how I am in relation to the knowledge, the discursive region where I locate myself is a post-structuralist feminist one. This way of reading (a post-structuralist feminist one) enables me to see the different levels in the discourse, assuming that a text is a multi-layered space where not just meaning, but also the syntax and the rhetoric of ‘silence’ are at stake...|$|R
