5|$|Despite the {{violence}} of the suppression, the government and local lords were relatively circumspect in restoring order after the revolt, and continued to be worried about fresh revolts for several decades. Few lords took revenge on their peasants except through the legal processes of the courts. Low-level unrest continued for several more years. In September 1382 there <b>was</b> <b>trouble</b> in Norfolk, involving an apparent plot against the Bishop of Norwich, and in March the following year there was an investigation into a plot to kill the sheriff of Devon. When negotiating rents with their landlords, peasants alluded to the memory of the revolt and the threat of violence.|$|E
5|$|Karluk left Esquimalt on 17 June 1913, sailing north towards Alaska. The {{immediate}} destination was Nome, {{on the coast}} of the Bering Sea. There <b>was</b> <b>trouble</b> from the beginning with the steering gear and with the engines, both of which needed frequent attention. On 2 July Karluk reached the Bering Sea in mist, fog and rapidly falling temperatures; six days later she arrived at Nome where she joined Alaska and Mary Sachs. While the ships were being loaded in Nome, some of the scientists pressed for a meeting with the leader to clarify plans, particularly with regard to the Northern Party whose schedule was vague. The meeting was unsatisfactory. Stefansson's attitude offended several of the men, some of whom threatened to leave the expedition. They had read press reports in which Stefansson had apparently said that he expected Karluk to be crushed, and that the lives of the staff were secondary to the scientific work. Stefansson would not explain these matters, nor give further details of his plans for the Northern Party. Despite the scientists' alarm and dissatisfaction, none resigned.|$|E
25|$|The first {{unmanned}} launch {{was originally}} planned in April 1967, requiring delivery at the Cape around September 1966. But delays kept occurring. Although the Lunar Module was fully designed, there <b>was</b> <b>trouble</b> fabricating the custom-made parts. The engines were also having problems. The descent engine was not burning smoothly, and the ascent engine was having fabrication and welding difficulties.|$|E

50|$|Why all Jerusalem should <b>be</b> <b>troubled</b> <b>is</b> a more {{important}} question. Throughout this chapter Matthew shows the leaders of Jerusalem allied with Herod against the new messiah. These passages have been quoted in support of Christian anti-Semitism. That all Jerusalem is agitated also seems to conflict with later in the Gospel when the people are oblivious to Jesus. France suggests that the passage could perhaps be read as showing {{that the people of}} Jerusalem <b>were</b> <b>troubled</b> because of the possibility of Herod's wrath. Other scholars see this interpretation as being fairly implausible. Brown notes that this phrase originates in Exodus. There is a theory that this part of Matthew is heavily influence by the story of Moses. In Exodus all Egypt <b>is</b> <b>troubled</b> by Moses, not just the Pharaoh. Thus in parallel all Jerusalem must also <b>be</b> <b>troubled.</b> This view <b>was</b> shared by St. Chrysostom.|$|R
25|$|Kulottunga {{spent the}} first few years of his reign {{fighting}} the war and rebellion that had sprung up in the various parts of the empire. Apart from the residues of the rebellion that caused Athirajendra's death, there <b>was</b> <b>trouble</b> in Lanka where the southern provinces had declared independence. Kulottunga also had to deal with the Chalukya Vikramaditya who never reconciled Kulottunga's accessiont to the Chola throne. Kulottunga devoted {{the first few years}} of his reign to deal with these troubles and made preparations for war.|$|E

I did that and I was quite successful. I think at the end of the tour I finished about fifth in the batting averages. But that didn't seem to make any difference. I was the only one who didn't play a Test match.|$|E
25|$|There <b>was</b> <b>trouble</b> {{from the}} moment Lankester put forward his {{candidature}} for the office vacated by Sir William Flower, {{who was on the}} point of death. The Principal Librarian, Sir Edward Maunde Thompson, the palaeographer, was also the Secretary to the Trustees, and hence in a strong position to get his own way. There is good evidence that Thompson, an efficient and authoritarian figure, intended {{to take control of the}} whole Museum, including the Natural History departments. In the absence of Huxley, who had led most of the battles for over thirty years, it was left to the younger generation to struggle for the independence of science, Mitchell, Poulton, and Weldon were his main supporters, and together they lobbied the Trustees, the Government and in the press to get their point over. Finally Lankester was appointed instead of Lazarus Fletcher (a relative nonentity).|$|E

25|$|Mansell {{began to}} attack Senna {{and after the}} stops got ahead of him. There <b>was</b> <b>trouble</b> when Berger spun after his stop and {{lost a lot of}} time. After the stops, Mansell led Alesi (who planned to go without stopping), Senna, Piquet, a {{recovering}} Patrese and de Cesaris. Then on lap 22, Mansell slowed to a halt with an electrical failure, giving Alesi the lead of the race. Senna's engine then stopped for some time and because of that Piquet, Patrese and de Cesaris were right with him and allowing Alesi to remain in the lead. Senna was unable to pull away because he had gearbox troubles. On lap 31 — still intending to run non-stop — Alesi's engine blew up and Senna was back in the lead. Patrese tried to pass Piquet but went wide and de Cesaris was able to take third.|$|E
25|$|Bouillé only {{managed to}} summon seven {{witnesses}} – Guillaume Manchon, Isambart de la Pierre, Martin Ladvenu, Guillaume Duval, Jean Toutmouillé, Jean Massieu, and Jean Beaupere – when his inquiry was suddenly broken off in March 1450. He {{had not even}} managed to review the dossiers and minutes of the trial of condemnation. Of the seven witnesses, most denounced the English for their desire for revenge against Joan, and their attempt to dishonor Charles VII's title by associating him with a finding of heresy against Joan. Only one was hostile against Joan – Jean Beaupere, the Canon of Rouen. Interviewed by Bouillé, he refused {{to answer questions about}} the procedure at the trial of condemnation. He stated that Joan was a fraud, believing that if Joan ‘had wise and frank teachers, she would have said many things serving to justify her, and withheld many which led to her condemnation.’ His testimony {{was not included in the}} report which Bouillé wrote up for Charles written later that year after Charles had closed down the inquiry. Circumstances had changed – the war against the retreating English was still occupying much of his attention, and there <b>was</b> <b>trouble</b> brewing with the Papacy over the Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges. Charles could afford to wait, but Bouillé made it clear that it was in the king's interest to clear up the matter once and for all.|$|E
500|$|From {{his general}} reading, Larkin had {{acquired}} a considerable knowledge of girls' school fiction, and had formed definite views on the authors of such works: [...] "stupid women without a grain of humour in their minds", who lacked [...] "erotic sensibility" [...] and treated the lesbian perspective [...] "too casually". His intention to write in this genre is expressed {{in a letter to}} his friend Norman Iles, dated 5 June 1943, just before Larkin sat his degree Finals: [...] "I am spending my time doing an obscene Lesbian novel in the form of a school story". The novel <b>was</b> <b>Trouble</b> at Willow Gables, a school adventure story in the manner of Dorita Fairlie Bruce or Dorothy Vicary, which Larkin completed at home while awaiting his Finals results. That was the prelude to a busy summer's writing: [...] "Leaving Oxford was like taking a cork out of a bottle. Writing flooded out of me", Larkin later told his biographer.|$|E

500|$|He {{lingered in}} Verona until 18 December, then {{spending}} some days in Venice with the Tsar {{and then by}} himself in Munich. He returned to Vienna in early January 1823 and remained until September; after Verona he travelled much less than before, partly because of his new post as Chancellor {{and partly because of}} his declining health. He was buoyed by the arrival of his family from Paris in May. He shone once more in Viennese society. Politically, the year was one of disappointments. In March the French crossed the Pyrenees unilaterally, undoing the [...] "moral solidarity" [...] established at Verona. Likewise, Metternich thought the new Pope Leo XII too pro-French, and there <b>was</b> <b>trouble</b> between Austria and several German states over why they had not been included at Verona. Furthermore, Metternich, in discrediting the Russian diplomat Pozzo di Borgo, instead renewed the Tsar's former suspicion of him. Worse came in late September: while accompanying the Emperor to a meeting with Alexander at Czernowitz, an Austrian settlement now in the Ukraine, Metternich fell ill with a fever. He could not continue and had to make do with brief talks with the Russian Foreign Minister, Karl Nesselrode. At the Czernowitz talks, in Metternich's absence, an impatient Tsar asked for a congress in the then Russian capital Saint Petersburg to discuss the Eastern Question. Metternich, wary of letting the Russians dominate affairs, could only play for time.|$|E

500|$|With the 2012 {{continuation}} of Dallas, {{there was talk}} of some Knots Landing characters returning to air. Rumors began surfacing that both Van Ark and Shackelford would reprise their roles as Valene and Gary. Ted Shackelford passed on the small role the producers offered him to reprise his role as Gary Ewing on the new series. [...] Van Ark refuted the claims, saying: [...] "Well, rumor has it… I’m having lunch with Ted tomorrow. They asked him to come down and be part of it. It was several months ago, and he’s deeply into filming The Young and the Restless, the daytime soap for CBS. But if they asked Gary, maybe they’ll ask [...]" [...] She would, however, love to be involved if the producers asked her, especially to torment fellow cast-member Larry Hagman. [...] "There is no doubt about it. This man I loved so much, Larry Hagman… I was just at his birthday party several months ago… I would kill, that if Val came back, if it <b>was</b> <b>trouble</b> for J.R.. Because they were always at odds." [...] However, Gary and Valene's daughter, Lucy Ewing, along with Ray Krebbs have made appearances in the new series. Although both Shackleford and Van Ark appeared in the 1991 series finale of Dallas playing [...] "alternative" [...] versions of Gary and Valene (the episode depicted a fantasy world in which J.R. had never been born), there have been no real crossovers of story or characters from Knots Landing to Dallas or vice versa since the 1985-86 season of each show (which, on Dallas, {{turned out to be a}} dream had by Pamela Ewing).|$|E
500|$|Crossland {{was named}} in the initial twelve-man squad for the first Test against Australia, which was played at Lancashire's Old Trafford ground. An {{official}} from the home ground chose the England team for each match. Lord Harris {{announced that he would}} not participate in the Test at Old Trafford if Crossland was selected. As a result, Lord Harris was withdrawn from the team and replaced by Tim O'Brien, although in the end Crossland did not play either. Lord Harris, who was both the captain of Kent and England in 1884, led the protests against throwing. He forced the retirement of two of Kent's bowlers, but was reasonably satisfied with Lancashire in 1884: for their match against Kent at Old Trafford, they dropped Nash, and by the meeting of the two sides in August that year, neither Crossland nor Nash were in the side. Lord Harris had hoped that this indicated that Lancashire were making efforts to [...] "of [...] own free will, and without agreement with other counties, to place [...] eleven in an irreproachable position", though Lancashire later clarified that Crossland had only missed the match as he was suffering from a shoulder injury; while Nash's bowling was not suited to the hard pitches those matches were played on. Crowd protests against Crossland spread; there <b>was</b> <b>trouble</b> during matches at both Yorkshire and Derbyshire in 1884. Towards the end of that season, the London Truth reported that during a club match in his home town of Sutton-in-Ashfield, Crossland was no balled by an umpire on account of throwing. Upon this, Crossland demanded the umpire retire from the match, and when the opposing captain refused, the match was abandoned. Crossland then announced, via the town crier, that his bowling would [...] "pass unquestioned" [...] in his next county match.|$|E
500|$|Frink is {{a popular}} {{character}} on The Simpsons and he has received acclaim from critics. Mark Hughes Cobb of The Tuscaloosa News named him his favorite secondary character from the show. Fort Worth Star-Telegrams Robert Philpot called the professor {{one of the five}} best supporting characters on The Simpsons, writing that [...] "Springfield's mad scientist is a triumph of style over substance, with Hank Azaria giving him a ripoff Jerry Lewis voice that reminds you why we once thought Lewis was funny." [...] On their list of the top twenty-five peripheral Simpsons characters, IGN's Eric Goldman, Dan Iverson, and Brian Zoromski listed Frink at number fourteen, commenting that he fits nicely into the Simpsons universe [...] "as the town's brilliant mad scientist." [...] They highlighted a scene from the episode [...] "The PTA Disbands", in which Frink becomes a kindergarten substitute teacher and keeps one of the children's toys to himself because the children [...] "wouldn't enjoy it on as many levels" [...] as he did. Nick Griffiths of Radio Times named Frink one of the best characters of the show, stating that he has [...] "always loved Professor Frink", particularly because of his appearance, gibberish talking, and overuse of the word [...] "the", and because of his inventions such as the matter teleporter that turns Bart into half-human half-fly. The Sydney Morning Heralds David Hollingworth profiled Frink in his list of [...] "TV's great tech figures", writing that apart from being smart, the professor {{is best known for his}} [...] "rather idiosyncratic speech patterns— hmmguyvin-whey-hey."
