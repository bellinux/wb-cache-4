5|$|Aberdaron hosts {{numerous}} sailing regattas featuring clinker built boats {{unique to}} the area; there is a popular regatta every August where the races are open to everyone. Sea angling trips are operated from Porth Meudwy, fishing for pollock, coley and mackerel; <b>wrasse,</b> bass, mullet and gurnard are also possible. Bass and coley can be caught from the rocks at Porth Iago; and <b>wrasse,</b> pollock and mackerel are plentiful. Access is difficult at Uwchmynydd, but pollock, mackerel, <b>wrasse</b> and conger are caught; huss are plentiful; and ling are found occasionally.|$|E
5|$|Notable {{marine species}} include the ormer, conger, bass, {{undulate}} ray, grey mullet, ballan <b>wrasse</b> and garfish. Marine mammals include the bottlenosed dolphin and grey seal.|$|E
5|$|The sabre-toothed blenny (Aspidontus taeniatus) is a predatory blenny, an {{aggressive}} mimic which accurately resembles the bluestreak cleaner <b>wrasse,</b> {{not only in}} colour and pattern, {{but also in the}} ritualised dance the cleaner <b>wrasse</b> makes when potential client fish swim nearby. However, instead of providing the cleaning service that it signals, it bites off pieces of healthy skin, scales and mucus from the host and then swims rapidly away to safety.|$|E
5|$|Another {{aggressive}} mimic of the cleaner <b>wrasse,</b> the bluestriped fangblenny, {{has evolved}} an opioid-containing venom which dulls pain and lowers blood pressure, confusing the bitten host {{and giving the}} cheating mimic time to escape.|$|E
5|$|Cheating, where {{either a}} cleaner {{sometimes}} harms its client, or a predatory species mimics a cleaner, also occurs. Predatory cheating {{is analogous to}} Batesian mimicry, as where a harmless hoverfly mimics a stinging wasp, though with the tables turned. Some genuine cleaner fish, such as gobies and <b>wrasse,</b> have the same colours and patterns, in an example of convergent evolution. Mutual resemblance among cleaner fish is analogous to Mullerian mimicry, as where stinging bees and wasps mimic each other.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} predator of S.latus is the grey triggerfish, Balistes capriscus, although {{a number of}} other fish species have also been reported to prey on S.latus, including dusky groupers (Epinephelus guaza), combers (Serranus spp.), Mediterranean rainbow <b>wrasse</b> (Coris julis), red groupers (Epinephelus morio) and gag groupers (Mycteroperca microlepis). An Octopus vulgaris has been observed to eat S.latus in an artificial setting, but it is unclear whether S.latus is preyed on by octopuses in nature.|$|E
5|$|Known predators of the bluespotted ribbontail ray include {{hammerhead sharks}} (Sphyrna) and {{bottlenose}} dolphins (Tursiops); {{it is also}} potentially preyed upon by other large fishes and marine mammals. When threatened, this ray tends to flee at high speed in a zigzag pattern, to throw off pursuers. Numerous parasites have been identified from this species: the tapeworms Aberrapex manjajiae, Anthobothrium taeniuri, Cephalobothrium taeniurai, Echinobothrium elegans and E. helmymohamedi, Kotorelliella jonesi, Polypocephalus saoudi, and Rhinebothrium ghardaguensis and R. taeniuri, the monogeneans Decacotyle lymmae, Empruthotrema quindecima, Entobdella australis, and Pseudohexabothrium taeniurae, the flatworms Pedunculacetabulum ghardaguensis and Anaporrhutum albidum, the nematode Mawsonascaris australis, the copepod Sheina orri, and the protozoan Trypanosoma taeniurae. This ray has been observed soliciting cleanings from the bluestreak cleaner <b>wrasse</b> (Labroides dimidiatus) by raising the margins of its disc and pelvic fins.|$|E
5|$|Like other caprellids, C. mutica are preyed upon {{predominantly}} by {{fish and}} crabs. In their native habitats, the predators of Caprellamutica include the shore crab Carcinus maenas and the goldsinny <b>wrasse</b> (Ctenolabrus rupestris) which consume them in large numbers. Other predators include nudibranchs, starfish, nemertean worms, sea anemones, and hydrozoans. They constitute a valuable food source for these organisms {{due to their}} high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids and carotenoids. They also provide an important link in the food chain between plankton and larger fish. This, {{in addition to their}} relative abundance and fast growth rates, make them a potentially important resource for marine fish feed in aquaculture. Introduced populations of C.mutica have become {{a major part of the}} diets of native wild and farmed fish.|$|E
5|$|Mimesis is practised by {{animals such as}} {{the leafy}} sea dragon, Phycodurus eques, and the leaf scorpionfish, Taenianotus triacanthus, which {{resemble}} parts of plants, and gently rock their bodies as if swayed by a current. In the fish species Novaculichthys taeniourus, the rockmover or dragon <b>wrasse,</b> there is a striking difference in appearance between the adults and the juveniles. A juvenile Rockmover resembles a loose piece of sea weed. It swims in a vertical position with its head pointing downwards, and behaves {{in a way that}} perfectly resembles the movement of a piece of seaweed: moving {{back and forth in the}} surge, as if it was inanimate.|$|E
5|$|Mimicry of mutualistic {{species is}} seen in coral reef fish, where the models, certain cleaner fish, are greatly {{disadvantaged}} {{by the presence of}} the mimic. Cleaner fish are the allies of many other species, which allow them to eat their parasites and dead skin in a mutually beneficial cleaning symbiosis. Some allow the cleaner to venture inside their mouths and gill cavities to hunt these parasites. However, one species of cleaner, the bluestreak cleaner <b>wrasse</b> (Labroides dimidiatus), is the unknowing model of a mimetic species, the sabre-toothed blenny (Aspidontus taeniatus). This <b>wrasse,</b> shown in the image cleaning a grouper of the genus Epinephelus, resides in coral reefs in the Indian and the Pacific Oceans, and is recognized by other fishes who then allow it to clean them. Its imposter, a species of blenny, lives in the Indian Ocean and not only looks like it in terms of size and coloration, but even mimics the cleaner's 'dance'. Having fooled its prey into letting its guard down, it then bites it, tearing off scales or a piece of fin before fleeing the scene. Fish grazed upon in this fashion soon learn to distinguish mimic from model, but because the similarity is close between the two they become much more cautious of the model as well, such that both are affected. Due to victims' ability to discriminate between foe and helper, the blennies have evolved close similarity, right down to the regional level.|$|E
5|$|The {{best known}} {{cleaning}} symbioses are among marine fishes, where {{several species of}} small fish, notably of <b>wrasse,</b> are specialised in colour, pattern and behaviour as cleaners, providing a cleaning and ectoparasite removal service to larger, often predatory fish. Cleaner species, {{as shown in the}} table, vary widely in their degree of dependence on their clients. Some are essentially pure obligate symbionts like the cleaner wrasse; some are opportunistic or facultative symbionts, like the orange chromide or some cleaner shrimps; and some, like the oxpeckers, combine a little eating of parasites (beneficial to client) with taking of blood (harmful to client), their favoured food.|$|E
5|$|Protandry is when an {{individual}} starts out male and becomes female while the reverse condition is known as protogyny, the latter being more common. Changing sex can occur in various contexts. In the bluestreak cleaner <b>wrasse,</b> where males have harems of up to ten females, if the male is removed {{the largest and most}} dominant female develops male-like behaviour and eventually testes. If she is removed, the next ranking female takes her place. In the species Anthias squamipinnis, where individuals gather into large groups and females greatly outnumber males, if a certain number of males are removed from a group, the same number of females change sex and replace them. In clownfish, individuals live in groups and only the two largest in a group breed: the largest female and the largest male. If the female dies, the male switches sexes and the next largest male takes his place.|$|E
25|$|Labroides bicolor is {{a species}} of <b>wrasse</b> endemic to the Indo-Pacific, Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean and is known by various names {{including}} bicolor cleanerfish, bicolor cleaner <b>wrasse,</b> bicolored cleaner <b>wrasse,</b> bicolour cleaner <b>wrasse,</b> cleaner <b>wrasse,</b> two-colour cleaner <b>wrasse</b> and yellow diesel <b>wrasse.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Formigas Bank is {{essentially}} a submarine volcano, inhabited by deep-dwelling marine species, coral and sponges. The cone is delimited approximately by the islets of the northwest and the Dollabarats reef to the southeast. In the ancient crater there is a rich community of species common to the Azores. Among the species typical of the area are <b>wrasse</b> (Mediterranean rainbow <b>wrasse,</b> ornate <b>wrasse),</b> damselfish, sergeant fish (yellow and black), grouper, Mediterranean parrotfish, and the emblematic Atlantic goliath grouper, Serranidae and barred hogfish. Alongside these are pelagic predators that also reside in the bank (African threadfish, longbill spearfish) and migratory species that travel between destinations (like the manta ray and whale shark).|$|E
25|$|Feeding {{intensity}} varies {{throughout the}} year, and is strongly correlated {{to changes in}} the precipitation and wind during cyclical shifts in the climate. Young fish tend to feed intensively throughout the year, but show a peak in the spring and autumn months, while adults intensify their feeding during the dry and rainy seasons, with feeding declining during intermediate periods (winter and early summer). Daily intakes during the period of intensive feeding reach 3–7% of the fishes body weight, and during the periods of decline to 0.5–2%, with the annual intake being 1000–1500% of the body weight. In a 1993 paper, Troy Baird reported a foraging association between bar jacks and puddingwife <b>wrasse,</b> Halichoeres radiatus, in which a jack followed a single <b>wrasse</b> while it foraged for food. These associations were initiated by both jacks and <b>wrasse,</b> with apparently little pilfering of uncovered items, suggesting a beneficial relationship to both parties. While foraging with the <b>wrasse,</b> the jack increases its prey detection levels, which is useful for a species which is more adept at pelagic hunting, allowing it to be more efficient at this less common mode of food gathering.|$|E
25|$|It {{is found}} to {{interact}} with 36 species including Striated surgeonfish, Acanthurus nigrofuscus, parrotfish and its cousin bluestreak cleaner <b>wrasse.</b> Like other cleaners, Labroides bicolor will dance {{as a form of}} communication and may also dance to reduce client aggression.|$|E
25|$|Examples of such {{shallow water}} {{demersal}} fish, found in both tropical and temperate waters around the world, are triplefins, seahorses, <b>wrasse</b> and flounder. As demersal fish, all these fish {{spend most of}} their time on or near the sea floor.|$|E
25|$|Wenyukela was {{a success}} in South Africa, {{prompting}} its release in Britain in March 2003 on <b>Wrasse</b> Records. Following the repeated success of the album, the American-based Heads Up International released the album in January 2004 and it garnered the group their second Grammy Award.|$|E
25|$|Cleaner fish, {{including}} five species of <b>wrasse</b> (Labridae), are used on fish farms in Norway {{and to a}} lesser extent in Scotland, Shetland and Ireland. Their potential has not been researched in other fish farming regions, such as Pacific and Atlantic Canada or Chile.|$|E
25|$|The reef {{lizardfish}} secretes a mucus coating {{which reduces}} drag when they swim and also protects it from some parasites. But other parasites find the mucus itself good to eat. So lizardfish visit the cleaner <b>wrasse,</b> which clean the parasites from the skin, gills and mouth.|$|E
25|$|On the 21 July 2011 {{a further}} eight designs were added {{featuring}} the beadlet anemone, the squat lobster, the cuckoo <b>wrasse,</b> the common frog, the green huntsman, the elephant hawk-moth, the goldfinch {{and the red}} deer. A third phase is scheduled for 9 August 2012 featuring green crab, raft spider, pike and the kestrel.|$|E
25|$|Approachable only by boat, the bay, {{which has}} water depth of about , {{provides}} opportunities for scuba diving {{during the day}} in the summer. The islet and the waters around it are protected for its rich biodiversity; ninety-six species of flora and fauna have been identified congregating on or in the waters of the islet, including the species of brown algae, limpets, barnacles and Mediterranean rainbow <b>wrasse.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sleep in fish is not {{extensively}} studied. Typically fish exhibit {{periods of}} inactivity but show no significant reactions to deprivation of this condition. Some species that always live in shoals or that swim continuously (because {{of a need}} for ram ventilation of the gills, for example) are suspected never to sleep. There is also doubt about certain blind species that live in caves. Other fish seem to sleep, however. For example, zebrafish, tilapia, tench, brown bullhead, and swell shark become motionless and unresponsive at night (or by day, {{in the case of}} the swell shark); Spanish hogfish and blue-headed <b>wrasse</b> can even be lifted by hand all the way to the surface without evoking a response. A 1961 observational study of approximately 200 species in European public aquaria reported many cases of apparent sleep. On the other hand, sleep patterns are easily disrupted and may even disappear during periods of migration, spawning, and parental care.|$|E
25|$|Another {{adaptive}} use of fluorescence is {{to generate}} red {{light from the}} ambient blue light of the photic zone to aid vision. Red light can only be seen across short distances due to attenuation of red light wavelengths by water. Many fish species that fluoresce are small, group-living, or benthic/aphotic, and have conspicuous patterning. This patterning is caused by fluorescent tissue and is visible to {{other members of the}} species, however the patterning is invisible at other visual spectra. These intraspecific fluorescent patterns also coincide with intra-species signaling. The patterns present in ocular rings to indicate directionality of an individual’s gaze, and along fins to indicate directionality of an individual’s movement. Current research suspects that this red fluorescence is used for private communication between members of the same species. Due to the prominence of blue light at ocean depths, red light and light of longer wavelengths are muddled, and many predatory reef fish have little to no sensitivity for light at these wavelengths. Fish such as the fairy <b>wrasse</b> that have developed visual sensitivity to longer wavelengths are able to display red fluorescent signals that give a high contrast to the blue environment and are conspicuous to conspecifics in short ranges, yet are relatively invisible to other common fish that have reduced sensitivities to long wavelengths. Thus, fluorescence can be used as adaptive signaling and intra-species communication in reef fish.|$|E
500|$|The lagoon is {{a nursery}} habitat for many fish species {{including}} important and heavily exploited {{species such as}} the Blacktip reef shark (Carcharhinus melanopterus) and the endangered Napoleon <b>wrasse</b> (Cheilinus undulatus).|$|E
500|$|The {{effect of}} {{aggressive}} mimicry in a cleaning symbiosis {{is analogous to}} Batesian mimicry, where a harmless [...] "edible mimetic species copies the warning signal of a noxious, aposematic model species, thereby gaining protection from predators". As in Batesian mimicry, the rate of successful attacks on cleaning clients by the bluestriped fangblenny (Plagiotremus rhinorhynchos), which like the sabre-toothed blenny mimic the bluestreak cleaner <b>wrasse</b> (Labroides dimidiatus), is frequency-dependent, meaning that the mimicry is more effective when the cheating fangblenny is rare compared to the cleaner <b>wrasse.</b> The difference, however, is that the aggressive mimic is inserting itself into a co-operative relationship (between cleaner and client), whereas [...] "Batesian mimics insert themselves into an antagonistic predator–prey interaction (where the models are the unpalatable prey)." [...] The fangblenny has evolved an opioid-containing venom which dulls pain and lowers blood pressure, confusing the bitten host and giving the cheating mimic time to escape.|$|E
500|$|Many {{cleaner fish}} in {{different}} families, {{such as the}} Caribbean neon goby (Elacatinus evelynae) and the Indo-Pacific cleaner <b>wrasse</b> (Labroides dimidiatus) share the distinctive combination of a long narrow body, a longitudinal stripe, a blue colour, and small size. [...] "Convergent signalling among cleaners, using size, stripes and colour, should facilitate their recognition by fish clients." [...] This is analogous to Mullerian mimicry where genuinely aposematic species (such as wasps) mimic each other's warning colours.|$|E
500|$|The {{tapeworm}} Parachristianella monomegacantha is a known parasite of the tasselled wobbegong. This {{species has}} been observed being attended by cleaner shrimp (Leander urocaridella, Stenopus hispidus) and bluestreak cleaner <b>wrasse</b> (Labroides dimidiatus). Reproduction is presumably aplacental viviparous like other wobbegongs, with the developing embryos sustained by yolk. There is a report of mating being observed inside a cave at night. Newborns measure approximately [...] long. Size at sexual maturity is uncertain; one recorded male {{was found to be}} adult at [...] long.|$|E
500|$|A case of {{the latter}} {{situation}} is a species of cleaner fish and its mimic, though in this example the model is greatly disadvantaged {{by the presence of}} the mimic. Cleaner fish are the allies of many other species, which allow them to eat their parasites and dead skin. Some allow the cleaner to venture inside their body to hunt these parasites. However, one species of cleaner, the bluestreak cleaner <b>wrasse</b> (Labroides dimidiatus), is the unknowing model of a mimetic species, the sabre-toothed blenny (Aspidontus taeniatus).

500|$|The group {{moved to}} <b>Wrasse</b> Records to release Boomerang in 2003. It {{featured}} performances by guests including Rokia Traoré. The album's title {{is based on}} the idea that hip hop music was born in Africa, spread around the world, then returned to the continent. Daara J note similarities between rap and tassou—a traditional African verbal performance technique used to discuss the social and political environment, daily life, and future aspirations. They believe it traveled from Africa by way of the United States slave trade. [...] A year after the release of the album, Daara J won the Best African Act award from BBC Radio 3.|$|E
500|$|Bushwalking, {{natural history}} tours, talks, and guided walks take place along the many tracks, the most {{challenging}} being the eight-hour guided hike {{to the top of}} Mount Gower. There are 11 beaches and hand-feeding the [...] kingfish (Seriola lalandi) and large <b>wrasse</b> at Ned's Beach is very popular. Walking tracks cover the island with difficulty graded from 1–5, they include – in the north: Transit Hill 2 hours return, Clear Place, 1–2 hours return; Stevens Reserve; North Bay, 4 hours return, Mount Eliza; Old Gulch, 20 minutes return, Malabar Hill and Kims Lookout, 3 hours, or 5 hours return, [...] and – in the south: Goat House Cave, 5 hours return, Mount Gower, 8 hours return, Rocky Run and Boat Harbour; Intermediate Hill, 45 minutes return, Little Island, 40 minutes return, [...] Recreational climbers must obtain permission from the Lord Howe Island Board.|$|E
500|$|Important predators of the whitetip reef shark include tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier), Galapagos sharks (Carcharhinus galapagensis), and {{possibly}} also silvertip sharks (Carcharhinus albimarginatus), though they usually occur at depths {{greater than those}} favored by whitetip reef sharks. An [...] long whitetip reef shark has also {{been found in the}} stomach of a giant grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus), though these groupers are unlikely to be significant predators of this species due to their rarity. Known parasites of the whitetip reef shark include the copepod Paralebion elongatus and the praniza (parasitic) larvae of the isopod Gnathia grandilaris. While resting during the day, these sharks have been observed being cleaned by the <b>wrasse</b> Bodianus diplotaenia and the goby Elacatinus puncticulatus. Unusually, there is also a report of seven whitetip reef sharks adopting a cleaning posture (mouth agape and gills flared) {{in the midst of a}} swarm of non-cleaning hyperiid amphipods; the mechanical stimulation from the moving amphipods are thought to have evoked this behavior through their similarity to actual cleaner organisms.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Wrasse</b> are a {{large family}} of mainly small fish, usually less than [...] long. Most <b>wrasse</b> are loners that prefer {{habitats}} such as coral reefs and rocky shores. They live close to the substrate, eating small invertebrates and almost anything else that lurks on the bottom. Many are brightly coloured. They have thick lips and use their sharp teeth to pick small creatures off the rocks. Many smaller wrasses follow the feeding trails of larger fish, picking up invertebrates disturbed by their passing.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{species of}} wrasses have been {{observed}} using rocks as anvils to crack bivalve (scallops, urchins and clams) shells. It [...] in an orange-dotted tuskfish (Choerodon anchorago) in 2009 by Giacomo Bernardi. The fish fans sand to unearth the bivalve, takes it into its mouth, swims several metres to a rock which it uses as an anvil by smashing the mollusc apart with sideward thrashes of the head. This behaviour has been recorded in a blackspot tuskfish (Choerodon schoenleinii) on Australia's Great Barrier Reef, yellowhead <b>wrasse</b> (Halichoeres garnoti) in Florida and a six-bar <b>wrasse</b> (Thalassoma hardwicke) in an aquarium setting. These species are {{at opposite ends of}} the phylogenetic tree in this [...] family, so this behaviour may be a deep-seated trait in all wrasses.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} internationally renowned Somali rappers is Canada-based K'naan (real name Kanaan Warsame). The award-winning artist is a rapper and a poet with three albums, The Dusty Foot Philosopher (on BMG Music), The Dusty Foot on the Road (on <b>Wrasse</b> Records) and Troubadour (on A/OctoScope Music) ...|$|E
2500|$|Several species {{build up}} mounds of coral pieces either {{to protect the}} {{entrance}} to their burrows, as in tilefishes and gobies of the genus Valenciennea, or to protect the patch of sand in which they will bury themselves for the night, as in the Jordan's tuskfish Choerodon jordani [...] and the rockmover <b>wrasse</b> Novaculichthys taeniourus.|$|E
