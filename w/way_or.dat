5|$|A {{successful}} Allied {{offensive in}} May finally {{broke through the}} Gustav Line, and Rome fell to Clark's army on 4 June. On 13 June, Devers ordered Larkin to shift priority for supplies from Fifth Army in Italy to Seventh Army. Two days later, Wilson ordered VI Corps to be withdrawn from the front line in preparation for Anvil. Virtually all the material needed for the assault was on hand, on the <b>way,</b> <b>or</b> promised, thanks to Devers' efforts to preserve the stockpile of Anvil stores and supplies even when the operation was in doubt. To command the assault, he created a special headquarters on Corsica called Advanced Detachment AFHQ, with Devers in command.|$|E
5|$|After small planetesimals—about 1km in diameter—have {{formed by}} one <b>way</b> <b>or</b> another, runaway {{accretion}} begins. It is called runaway because the mass growth rate {{is proportional to}} , where R and M are the radius and mass of the growing body, respectively. It {{is obvious that the}} specific (divided by mass) growth accelerates as the mass increases. This leads to the preferential growth of larger bodies at the expense of smaller ones. The runaway accretion lasts between 10,000 and 100,000years and ends when the largest bodies exceed approximately 1,000km in diameter. Slowing of the accretion is caused by gravitational perturbations by large bodies on the remaining planetesimals. In addition, the influence of larger bodies stops further growth of smaller bodies.|$|E

If an attack is suspected or detected in its early stages, it takes some time for encryption to take place; immediate removal of the malware (a relatively simple process) before it has completed would stop further damage to data, without salvaging any already lost.|$|E
5|$|Coropuna is drained by deep gorges, {{with water}} {{eventually}} reaching the Arma and Majes rivers, {{both of which}} empty into the Pacific Ocean. During the dry season, Coropuna's glaciers are {{a major source of}} water for the region, and concern has been raised that their disappearance may result in water shortages at a time when population growth has increased water consumption and begun to create conflict over water distribution. 30,000 people depend on the Coropuna glacier in one <b>way</b> <b>or</b> the other, 8,000 of them just for their water supply.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the native {{language}} of {{a significant part of the}} country's population is Russian, the language occupies a modest role in Israel's education system. Hebrew University started teaching Russian in 1962. In public schools, the first Russian-language classes were opened in the 1970s in large cities. The number of students enrolled in these programs dropped in the 1980s as immigration from the Soviet Union slowed down. In the 1990s, a Russian-language program carried out by local governments called Na'leh 16 included some 1,500 students. In 1997, about 120 schools in Israel taught Russian in one <b>way</b> <b>or</b> another.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Smoking Man was an {{aspiring}} writer of espionage (and later, science-fiction) novels starring a fictional version of himself, Jack Colquitt, {{and based on}} his own secret activities, but all his drafts were rejected or altered by publishers who found them unrealistic and poorly written. This left him {{no choice but to}} continue working for the United States government. By 1991, the Smoking Man's power was pretty much absolute. He was in direct talks with Saddam Hussein and involved in one <b>way</b> <b>or</b> another on the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas controversy, moving the Rodney King trial to Simi Valley, keeping the US government from interferring in the independence of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Academy Awards nominations, keeping the Buffalo Bills from ever winning the Super Bowl, drugging the Soviet goalkeeper before the Miracle on Ice, and executing extraterrestrials that survived landing on American soil.|$|E

5|$|Bribery. Doing {{any one of}} {{a number}} of acts to induce a person to vote or refrain from voting or to reward him for having done so, such as giving or lending money; and giving or {{procuring}} an office or employment, amounts to bribery. It is also bribery for a person to procure or promise to procure that a voter exercise his vote in a certain <b>way</b> <b>or</b> that a candidate be elected as President in return for some inducement; to give money to someone else, knowing that he will use the money for bribery at an election; to accept an inducement for voting or not voting or agreeing to do so; and to induce a person to consent to being nominated as a candidate, or refrain or withdraw from being a candidate in return for some inducement. The penalty is a fine of up to $5,000 or imprisonment not exceeding three years or both; and disqualification from being registered as a voter, voting at any election, or being elected to Parliament or the office of President for seven years.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1910s, a {{passable}} {{dirt and}} gravel road connected Ukiah and Nevada City via the south side of Clear Lake and Marysville. The portion between Lower Lake and Wilbur Springs was impassable in wet weather, at which times the Bartlett Springs and Bear Valley Toll-road via Upper Lake and Bartlett Springs was available for $1.50 each <b>way</b> <b>or</b> $2.50 round trip. This route generally followed the present SR 20, except around Clear Lake and between Marysville and Rough and Ready (where it used Spenceville Road). Beyond Nevada City to Emigrant Gap, the old turnpike was not passable; instead the present SR 174 was available for eastward drivers. Between Williams and Colusa, the road was paved in concrete, as it had been added to the state highway system as part of the first (1910) bond issue, specifically as Route 15, connecting the west Sacramento Valley trunk (Route 7, now I-5) with the county seat of Colusa.|$|E
5|$|If it was {{necessary}} to seize control of a castle an army could either launch an assault or lay siege. It was more efficient to starve the garrison out than to assault it, particularly for the most heavily defended sites. Without relief from an external source, the defenders would eventually submit. Sieges could last weeks, months, and in rare cases years if the supplies of food and water were plentiful. A long siege could slow down the army, allowing help to come or for the enemy to prepare a larger force for later. Such an approach was not confined to castles, but was also applied to the fortified towns of the day. On occasion, siege castles would be built to defend the besiegers from a sudden sally and would have been abandoned after the siege ended one <b>way</b> <b>or</b> another.|$|E

5|$|In 1080°s two trick modes, trick {{attack and}} contest, players accrue points from {{completed}} tricks. In contest mode, players perform tricks and snowboard past flags for points. Trick attack mode requires players {{to perform a}} series of tricks throughout a designated level. The game features 25 tricks, {{all of which are}} performed by using a combination of circular positions of the control stick, the R button, and the B button; point values are allocated based on complexity and required time. The two types of tricks are grab tricks, in which the board is grabbed in a specific <b>way,</b> <b>or</b> spin tricks, in which the snowboarder spins the board a certain number of degrees. The 1080° spin requires nine actions, the most of any trick in the game.|$|E
5|$|In late 1869, Earp courted 20-year-old Urilla Sutherland (c. 1849–1870), the {{daughter}} of William and Permelia Sutherland, who operated the Exchange Hotel in Lamar. They were married by his father Nicholas in Lamar on January 10, 1870, and in August 1870, Wyatt bought {{a lot on the}} outskirts of town for $50, where he built a house. Urilla was pregnant and about to deliver their first child when she suddenly died from typhoid fever. In November, Earp sold the lot and a house on it for $75. Hoping to keep the office to which he had been appointed, he ran against his elder half-brother Newton for the office of constable. The Earps may have hoped to keep the job in the family one <b>way</b> <b>or</b> another. Wyatt won by 137 votes to Newton's 108, but their father Nicholas lost the election for justice of the peace in a very close four-way race.|$|E
5|$|Most {{vertebrate}} {{species have}} a cerebellum {{and one or}} more cerebellum-like structures, brain areas that resemble the cerebellum in terms of cytoarchitecture and neurochemistry. The only cerebellum-like structure found in mammals is the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN), {{one of the two}} primary sensory nuclei that receive input directly from the auditory nerve. The DCN is a layered structure, with the bottom layer containing granule cells {{similar to those of the}} cerebellum, giving rise to parallel fibers that rise to the superficial layer and travel across it horizontally. The superficial layer contains a set of GABAergic neurons called cartwheel cells that resemble Purkinje cells anatomically and chemically—they receive parallel fiber input, but do not have any inputs that resemble climbing fibers. The output neurons of the DCN are pyramidal cells. They are glutamatergic, but also resemble Purkinje cells in some respects—they have spiny, flattened superficial dendritic trees that receive parallel fiber input, but they also have basal dendrites that receive input from auditory nerve fibers, which travel across the DCN in a direction at right angles to the parallel fibers. The DCN is most highly developed in rodents and other small animals, and is considerably reduced in primates. Its function is not well understood; the most popular speculations relate it to spatial hearing in one <b>way</b> <b>or</b> another.|$|E
