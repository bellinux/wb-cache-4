5|$|In 87, Vestal Virgins {{were found}} to have broken their sacred vows of lifelong public chastity.

Ethical value denotes something's degree of importance, {{with the aim of}} determining what action or life is best to do, or at least attempt to describe the value of different actions.

Diminutive and unassuming, his subsequent rise to the Pro Football Hall of Fame has been touted as one of American football's Cinderella stories. He made up for his lack of athleticism through rigorous practice and attention to detail, and was known for his near-perfect route running and sure handedness.

5|$|After the {{appointment}} of Geoff Henke—who {{had been unable to}} compete in 1956 after the administrators neglected to endorse his ice hockey team's application—as team manager in 1976, the results slowly began to improve, and by the 1990s, some Australians <b>were</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> medal prospects. The upturn in performance was accompanied by increased government funding for winter sports, the creation of the Olympic Winter Institute of Australia and the purchase of an alpine training base in Austria.|$|E
