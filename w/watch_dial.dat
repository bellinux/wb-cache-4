These variants sometimes also had differing Rolex reference numbers. Some of these non-standard Sea-Dweller watches had the Comex S.A. logo depicted on the <b>watch</b> <b>dial,</b> which led to an unofficial [...] "COMEX watches" [...] designation by collectors. These watches were either issued to Comex staff members or were given as business gifts.|$|E

50|$|Movado is a Swiss watchmaker {{best known}} for its Museum Watch. Designed in 1947 by Bauhaus-influenced artist Nathan George Horwitt, the <b>watch</b> <b>dial</b> has a very simple design dial defined by a solitary dot at 12, symbolizing the sun at high noon. It was first made by Vacheron & Constantin-Le Coultre Watches, Inc., and later {{produced}} by Movado. Horwitt's dial was selected for the permanent design collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1960, the first <b>watch</b> <b>dial</b> awarded this distinction. The single dot dial now appears in many of Movado's timepieces.|$|E

From the first steps his company had a cross-border success all over the old continent.|$|E
5000|$|Loupes are {{employed}} to assist watchmakers in assembling mechanical watches. Many aspects {{require the use}} of the loupe, in particular the assembly of the watch mechanism itself, the assembly and details of the <b>watch</b> <b>dial,</b> as well as the formation of the watch strap and installation of precious stones onto the watch face. Some families like Kruder which were into watchmaking and working with glass started producing high-quality loupes in addition to their watches ...|$|E
50|$|After 1924, he and William McGavock {{fabricated}} {{a laboratory}} for the refining of mesothorium (from monazite ore) and radium (from discarded <b>watch</b> <b>dials).</b> It was a unique source of thorium and was resorted to by many noted scientists, for example Marie Curie. The lab received national press notice in 1930 and shortly thereafter closed.|$|R
50|$|As Schnyder <b>watched</b> <b>dials</b> {{materialize}} in {{the skilled}} hands of factory workers, a blue flash of inspiration blazed through him. He was {{absolutely certain that}} Thai workers could learn the trade of dial-making given the opportunity. The vastly lower cost of human labor in the Far East meant that Schnyder could craft <b>watch</b> <b>dials</b> of similar quality at a far lower price per unit which would permit the Swiss watch industry to stay competitive against the lower-priced products emerging from the Japan's Seiko. Charles and Marcel Stern were immediately sold on the idea, but the rigid Swiss syndicate that presided over the Swiss dial manufacturers was more difficult to convince. Finally, in 1968 Schnyder helped forge a joint partnership between Swiss and Asian investors to open the Cosmo dial and watchcase factory in Thailand. Schnyder immediately quit his job with Philip Morris and took the helm of this new enterprise.|$|R

50|$|Apart {{from the}} Geneva Seal, some watches carry the name Geneva or Genève on their dials. The {{use of the}} name Geneva on a <b>watch</b> <b>dial</b> is governed by the Bureau de contrôle des Montres de Genève. To wear this badge, a watch must be a Swiss watch {{and at least one}} of the major {{operations}} in fabrication— either assembly of the movement or insertion of the movement into the case— must have been performed in the Swiss canton of Genève so that at least 50% of the total cost of production is incurred there.|$|E
5000|$|In 1986, {{documentary}} film maker Carole Langer made {{a film that}} covered {{the plight of the}} so-called [...] "Radium Girls" [...] who worked in the <b>watch</b> <b>dial</b> industry. The women, who had been told the paint was harmless, ingested deadly amounts of radium after being instructed to lick their paintbrushes to sharpen them; some even painted their fingernails with the glowing paint.Many of the women began to suffer from anemia, bone fractures and necrosis of the jaw, a condition now known as radium jaw. Many of these women died young.|$|E
5000|$|In 1922, the Radium Dial Company (RDC) {{moved from}} Peru, Illinois {{to a former}} high school {{building}} in Ottawa.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} a reinterpretation of early modern clock and <b>watch</b> <b>dials</b> {{on the basis}} of use, in response to an immense gap left in horological historiography where dial designs have been dismissed as insignificant beyond aesthetic concerns. By 1770 a standard design had emerged, which represented hours, minutes and seconds. Yet, between 1550 and 1770 dials represented combinations of calendrical, lunar and astronomical information using multiple concentric rings, subsidiary dials and apertures. Change was gradual, but significant. I have developed a unique methodology for unlocking the meaning embedded within these early combinations and the significance of dial change, by closely comparing a selection of clock and <b>watch</b> <b>dials</b> from different museum collections with printed paper sources such as almanacs, astronomical, astrological and mnemonic diagrams, craft books, and art works. Multiple concentric rings and subsidiary dials bore similarity to circular and tree diagrams and were conducive to perceptions of stepped knowledge acquisition. Both media became plainer in appearance from the mid-late seventeenth century as these perceptions declined. Some makers utilised different formats to generate trust in their work, from alternative hour schemes during the late-sixteenth century to imitation of precision timepieces from the early-eighteenth century. Others utilised touch-pins, during the mid-late sixteenth century, and illumination of numerals, from the late-seventeenth to the early-eighteenth century, to enable users who were otherwise excluded. The calendar, lunar and astronomical functions were useful as a prompt for recalling astrological advice up until its decline during the mid-late seventeenth century. After which, the three functions enjoyed different lifespans, while they continued to be useful for other purposes, but none survived {{to be part of the}} standard format. It is only through the lens of use and comparison with the wider context that the significance of early modern clock and <b>watch</b> <b>dials</b> can be fully appreciated. ...|$|R
5000|$|Modern {{implementations}} typically {{allow the}} tourbillon {{to be seen}} through a window in the watch face. In addition to enhancing the charm of the piece, the tourbillon {{can act as a}} second hand for some watches as it generally rotates once per minute. However some tourbillons spin faster (Greubel Forsey's 24-second tourbillon for example). There are many watches that feature the oscillating balance wheel visible through the <b>watch</b> <b>dial</b> that are not tourbillons. This feature {{is often referred to as}} [...] "open heart" [...] though it is often called a tourbillon by unscrupulous dealers.|$|E

50|$|Dr. Martland made {{important}} {{contributions in the}} fields of pathology and forensic medicine. The work that attracted the most attention was his research begun in 1924, on the effects of radioactive material on the human body. Dr. Martland determined that minute traces of radioactivity contained in luminous paint had caused the deaths of <b>watch</b> <b>dial</b> painters employed at the US Radium Corporation in Orange, NJ. The Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) credits Dr. Martland's work with having made it possible for atomic development to proceed with comparative safety. At the request of the AEC, Dr. Martland prepared a permanent exhibit on radioactive dangers and precautions which is on display in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. In 1916, Dr. Martland alerted dynamite manufacturers to the dangers of occupational poisoning in TNT.|$|E
