25|$|By {{the start}} of the Continuation War, the ability of the Finnish Navy to lay mines was {{improved}} significantly. In the spring of 1941, two state-of-the-art mine layers had been built, the mine supplies <b>were</b> <b>bigger,</b> and German influence mines of the latest design had been acquired, and Finland was also producing sea mines of its own.

Heavy casualties led to the OKH Operations Order No. 1, which ordered Army Group North to defense during the winter. In November, the German reinforcements and other units were stripped from Army Group North to deal with a major Soviet offensive at Stalingrad and Operation Northern Light was aborted.|$|E

The cost had increased to between $11 and $12 million. The basement of the old school had been removed and {{the third floor of the}} 1925 building was left for future expansion.

40|$|In this dissertation, {{we study}} the partial and generic {{uniqueness}} of block term tensor decompositions in signal processing. We present several conditions for generic uniqueness of tensor decompositions of multilinear rank (1, L 1, L 1), [...] ., (1, LR, LR) terms. Our proof {{is based on}} algebraic geometric methods. Mathematical preliminaries for this dissertation are multilinear algebra, and classical algebraic geometry. In geometric language, we prove that the joins of relevant subspace varieties are not tangentially weakly defective. We also give conditions for partial uniqueness of block term tensor decompositions by proving that the joins of relevant subspace varieties are not defective. The main result is the following. For a tensor Y belong to the tensor product of three complex vector spaces of dimensions I, J, K, we assume that L 1, L 2, [...] ., LR is from small to large, K <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to J, and J <b>is</b> strictly <b>bigger</b> than LR. If the dimension of ambient space is strictly less than IJK, then for general tensors among those admitting block term tensor decomposition, the block term tensor decomposition is partially unique {{under the condition that}} the binomial coefficient indexed by J and LR <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to R, and I <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to 2; it has infinitely many expressions under the condition IJK is strictly less than the sum from L_ 1 ^ 2 to L_R^ 2; it is essentially unique under any of the following there conditions: (i) I <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to 2, J, K <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to the sum from L 1 to LR (ii) R is 2, I <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to 2 (iii) I <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to R, K <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to the sum from L 1 to LR, J <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to 2 LR, the binomial coefficient indexed by J and LR <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to R...|$|R
25|$|Recently emerged {{individual}} young wasps {{have black}} or brown eyes, while older individuals have pink eyes and grow wings to fly.

Since worker production extends until the end of January, workers arising this month <b>were</b> <b>bigger</b> in size than those born in the earlier part of the season, around November and December. Variations in reproductive capacity and body size of the female young are due to changes in the amount of food given to them when they were larvae.|$|E
25|$|Despite his optimism, O'Neal {{found it}} {{difficult}} to break into the first team the following season. Brian Grant was acquired from free agency and new coach Mike Dunleavy, Sr. planned to use Sabonis, Wallace and Grant as the starting frontcourt, while the presence of veteran Gary Trent also further reduced the sophomore's chances. Thus, O'Neal was not given meaningful minutes {{in the early part of}} the campaign, although he showed glimpses of his potential with occasional double double performances when he returned from an early-season injury. Portland eventually produced a similar win–loss record as the preceding season with 46 wins, finishing fourth in the division. In the playoffs, Dunleavy opted to go with a more youthful lineup: before the trade deadline, he had acquired point guard Damon Stoudamire, as well as forwards Carlos Rogers and Walt Williams. The move was designed to bolster the team's chances in the playoffs against teams that <b>were</b> <b>bigger</b> and more physical. Nevertheless, for the second time in two years, the Trail Blazers were eliminated by the Lakers in four games in the first round. And just like the season before, O'Neal hardly featured for Portland, playing only three minutes in one game.|$|E
25|$|With Chancellor abroad, and the Zionist Commission itself, {{with its}} leader Colonel Frederick Kisch, in Zurich for the 16th Zionist Congress (attended also by Ze'ev Jabotinsky), the SMC resumed works, confidentially authorised, on the Haram {{only to be}} met with outcries from the Jewish press. The {{administration}} rapidly published the new rules on 22 July, with a serious error in translation that fueled Zionist reports of a plot against Jewish rights. A protest in London led to a public declaration {{by a member of}} the Zionist Commission that Jewish rights <b>were</b> <b>bigger</b> than the status quo, a statement which encouraged in turn Arab suspicions that local agreements were again being overthrown by Jewish intrigues abroad. News that the Zurich Congress, in creating the Jewish Agency on 11 August., had brought unity among Zionists and the world Jewish community, a measure that would greatly increase Jewish investment in British Palestine, set off alarm bells. On 15 August, Tisha B'Av, a day memorializing the destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem, the revisionist Betar movement, despite Pinhas Rutenberg's plea on 8 August to the acting High Commissioner Harry Luke to stop such groups from participating, rallied members from Tel Aviv to join them in the religious commemoration. Kisch, before leaving, had banned Jewish demonstrations in Jerusalem's Arab quarters. The Betar youth gave the ceremony a strong nationalist tinge by singing the Hatikvah, waving the flag of Israel, and chanting the slogan 'The Wall is Ours'. The following day coincided with mawlid (or mawsin al-nabi), the anniversary of the birth of Islam's prophet, Muhammad. Muslim worshippers, after prayers on the esplanade of the Haram, passed through the narrow lane by the Wailing Wall and ripped up prayer books, and kotel notes (wall petitions), without harming however three Jews present. Contacted by Luke, al-Husseini undertook to do his best to maintain calm on the Haram, but could not stop demonstrators from gathering at the Wall.|$|E
