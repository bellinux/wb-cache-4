5|$|After their father's {{death in}} 1906, Hogg and her {{brothers}} {{tried to sell}} the Varner plantation, but a provision in his will specified that the land be kept for 15years.

A second strike the following year provided oil income amounting to $225,000 a month shared among the four siblings. According to Hogg biographer Gwendolyn Cone Neely, the Hoggs {{did not believe that}} the oil money was rightfully theirs, as it had come from the land and not hard work, and they were determined to use it for the good of Texas.|$|E

5|$|As birds began nesting on the island, soil {{conditions}} improved, and more vascular plant species {{were able to}} survive. In 1998, the first bush <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island—a tea-leaved willow (Salix phylicifolia), which can grow to heights of up to 4metres (13ft). By 2008, 69species of plant had been found on Surtsey, of which about 30 had become established. This compares to the approximately 490 species found on mainland Iceland. More species continue to arrive, at a typical rate of roughly 2–5new species per year.|$|E
5|$|Bales burned {{some of the}} victims' bodies, an act {{considered}} desecration under Islamic law.

5|$|Because Poe <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> day of an election, it was {{suggested}} as early as 1872 {{that he was the}} victim of cooping. This was a ballot-box-stuffing scam in which victims were shanghaied, drugged, and used as a pawn to vote for a political party at multiple locations. Cooping had become the standard explanation for Poe's death in most of his biographies for several decades, though his status in Baltimore may have made him too recognizable for this scam to have worked. More recently, analysis suggesting that Poe's death resulted from rabies has been presented.|$|E

5|$|Bisporella citrina is saprobic, and so obtains {{nutrients}} {{by breaking}} down complex organic molecules into simpler ones. Fruit bodies are typically encountered growing in dense clusters {{on the surface}} of rotten wood (especially deciduous trees), particularly beech. They have also been found growing on the fruit bodies of the polypore fungus Daedaleopsis confragosa. In a study of the succession of fungi associated with the decay of a 120-year-old healthy beech tree uprooted by strong winds, B.citrina <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wood about three years after the fall. It appeared after early colonizers such as Quaternaria quaternata, Tubercularia vulgaris (the anamorph form of Nectria cinnabarina), and Bulgaria inquinans, and was followed by Stereum hirsutum and Nectria cinnabarina.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the fire was under control, the house was almost totally destroyed, leaving behind only the garage and some front stonework. The fire had spread rapidly, and {{although}} high winds contributed to the intensity, authorities deemed {{the speed with which}} the house had become fully involved suspicious enough to bring in arson investigators. The bodies of Tim and Kelly were not recovered until the following morning, when the house had cooled enough to permit safe searching. Kelly had perished in her bed, most likely of smoke inhalation. Tim's body <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground floor, near the kitchen. Investigators at first assumed he had died trying to escape, but later determined that he had perished in or near his bedroom, most likely of smoke inhalation and heat, and that his body had fallen through burned flooring to where it was discovered.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{apparent}} {{success of the}} cane toad in eating the beetles threatening the sugarcane plantations of Puerto Rico, and the fruitful introductions into Hawaii and the Philippines, a strong push was made for the cane toad {{to be released in}} Australia to negate the pests ravaging the Queensland cane fields. As a result, 102 toads were collected from Hawaii and brought to Australia. After an initial release in August 1935, the Commonwealth Department of Health decided to ban future introductions until a study was conducted into the feeding habits of the toad. The study was completed in 1936 and the ban lifted, when large-scale releases were undertaken; by March 1937, 62,000 toadlets had been released into the wild. The toads became firmly established in Queensland, increasing exponentially in number and extending their range into the Northern Territory and New South Wales. In 2010, one <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> far western coast in Broome, Western Australia.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, Canadian Davidson Black {{identified}} two fossilized teeth {{he had found}} in Zhoukoudian near Beijing as belonging to an ancient human, and named his specimen Sinanthropus pekinensis, now better known as Peking Man. In December 1929, {{the first of several}} skullcaps <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same site, and it appeared similar but slightly larger than Java Man. Franz Weidenreich, who replaced Black in China after the latter's death in 1933, argued that Sinanthropus was also a transitional fossil between apes and humans, and was in fact so similar to Java's Pithecanthropus that they should both belong to the family Hominidae. Eugène Dubois categorically refused to entertain this possibility, dismissing Peking Man as a kind of Neanderthal, closer to humans than the Pithecanthropus, and insisting that Pithecanthropus belonged to its own family, the Pithecanthropoidae.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a 23-year-old {{woman in}} India, over eight months pregnant, hanged herself after contractions had begun.

The healthy infant <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor, still {{tethered to the}} body of the mother by the umbilical cord. The primary cause of the delivery was the otherwise normal contractions, which had begun prior to death, and was therefore not related to processes of decomposition. While this is not postmortem fetal extrusion, it may be referred to as a case of postmortem delivery, a term which is applied to a broad range of techniques and phenomena with a resultant delivery of a live infant.|$|E
