5|$|In 1451, {{the very}} {{powerful}} Bosnian regional lord Herzeg Stjepan Vukčić Kosača attacked Dubrovnik, and laid siege to the city. He had earlier been made a Ragusan nobleman and, consequently, the Ragusan government now proclaimed him a traitor. A reward of 15,000 ducats, a palace in Dubrovnik worth 2,000 ducats, {{and an annual}} income of 300 ducats was offered to anyone who <b>would</b> <b>kill</b> <b>him,</b> along {{with the promise of}} hereditary Ragusan nobility which also helped hold this promise to whoever did the deed. Stjepan was so scared by the threat that he finally raised the siege.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Szilard was {{diagnosed}} with bladder cancer. He underwent cobalt therapy at New York's Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital using a cobalt 60 treatment regimen that he designed himself. A second round of treatment with an increased dose followed in 1962. The doctors tried {{to tell him that}} the increased radiation dose <b>would</b> <b>kill</b> <b>him,</b> but he said it wouldn't, and that anyway he would die without it. The higher dose did its job and his cancer never returned. This treatment became standard for many cancers and is still used.|$|E

5|$|When questioned, Patrick Darby {{testified that}} in 1824, Beauchamp had {{solicited}} his services {{in order to}} bring suit against Sharp for unspecified charges. During their ensuing conversations, Beauchamp had related the story of Sharp's abandonment of Anna Cooke and her child, swearing that he <b>would</b> <b>kill</b> <b>him</b> one day, even if he had to come to Frankfort and shoot him down in the street. The combined testimonies of Eliza Sharp and Patrick Darby were sufficient to persuade the city magistrates to hold Beauchamp for trial during the circuit court's next term, which began in March 1826.|$|E
5|$|With Simmons' help, Johnson {{discovers that}} the Watchdogs have hacked S.H.I.E.L.D.'s list using {{tracking}} wristwatches given to all registered Inhumans. The next Inhuman {{on the list}} is J.T. James, an Inhuman with explosive abilities who spent time with Johnson {{under the influence of the}} parasitic Inhuman Hive. Johnson and Simmons remove James's wristwatch, but he betrays them to the Watchdogs with the promise that they <b>would</b> <b>kill</b> <b>him</b> once he helped destroy the other Inhumans—James hates himself and his Inhuman identity. Before they can investigate the Darkhold, Coulson and Mack are alerted to James's wristwatch being removed, and arrive to help Johnson and Simmons fight off the Watchdogs and arrest James.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, Fatima Jinnah {{joined her}} brother in England. From then on, Muhammad Jinnah would receive {{personal}} care {{and support from}} her as he aged and began to suffer from the lung ailments which <b>would</b> <b>kill</b> <b>him.</b> She lived and travelled with him, and became a close advisor. Muhammad Jinnah's daughter, Dina, was educated in England and India. Jinnah later became estranged from Dina after she decided to marry a Christian, Neville Wadia from a prominent Parsi business family. When Jinnah urged Dina to marry a Muslim, she reminded {{him that he had}} married a woman not raised in his faith. Jinnah continued to correspond cordially with his daughter, but their personal relationship was strained, and she did not come to Pakistan in his lifetime, but only for his funeral.|$|E

5|$|In Krishna charitas, Krishna is born to Devaki and her husband, Vasudeva of the Chandravanshi clan. Devaki's {{brother is}} a tyrant named Kamsa. At Devaki's wedding, {{according}} to Puranic legends, Kamsa is told by fortune tellers {{that a child}} of Devaki <b>would</b> <b>kill</b> <b>him.</b> Kamsa arranges to kill all of Devaki's children. When Krishna is born, Vasudeva secretly carries the infant Krishna away across the Yamuna and exchanges him. When Kamsa tries to kill the newborn, the exchanged baby appears as the Hindu goddess Durga, warning him that his death has arrived in his kingdom, and then disappears, according to the legends in the Puranas. Krishna grows up with Nanda and his wife Yasoda near modern-day Mathura. Two of Krishna's siblings also survive, namely Balarama and Subhadra, according to these legends. The day of birth of Krishna is celebrated as Krishna Janmashtami.|$|E
5|$|Bartholomew meets Jeremy and Alysa {{at the top}} of the mountain, and {{informs the}} pair that the vampires have already summoned a {{powerful}} demon that will slaughter mankind. Bartholomew has called upon the army of Rome, led by the powerful First Paladin of Rome, to defeat the demon. Jeremy, knowing that the First Paladin of Rome <b>would</b> <b>kill</b> <b>him</b> and Alysa on sight, sets off to defeat the demon before the army of Rome arrives. When Jeremy and Alysa confront the demon, it explains that it was summoned because the humans have become too numerous, and with increased numbers they have gone from fearing vampires to hunting them. Jeremy and Alysa kill the demon and Bartholomew recovers the Blood Seal. As he does this, the First Paladin of Rome arrives and demands the seal for himself. Bartholomew gives the seal to Jeremy instead, and battles the Paladin to delay the army of Rome.|$|E
5|$|Mamie Till Bradley and Emmett lived {{together}} in a busy neighborhood in Chicago's South Side, near distant relatives. She began working as a civilian clerk for the U.S. Air Force for a better salary. She recalled that Emmett was industrious enough to help with chores at home, although he sometimes got distracted. His mother remembered {{that he did not}} know his own limitations at times. Following the couple's separation, Bradley visited Mamie and began threatening her. At eleven years old, Emmett, with a butcher knife in hand, told Bradley he <b>would</b> <b>kill</b> <b>him</b> if the man did not leave. Usually, however, Emmett was happy. He and his cousins and friends pulled pranks on each other (Emmett once took advantage of an extended car ride when his friend fell asleep and placed the friend's underwear on his head), and they also spent their free time in pickup baseball games. He was a natty dresser and was often the center of attention among his peers.|$|E

5|$|On July 4, 1939, Ruth {{spoke on}} Lou Gehrig Appreciation Day at Yankee Stadium {{as members of}} the 1927 Yankees and a sellout crowd turned out to honor the first baseman, who was forced into {{premature}} retirement by ALS disease, which <b>would</b> <b>kill</b> <b>him</b> two years later. The next week, Ruth went to Cooperstown, New York, for the formal opening of the Baseball Hall of Fame. Three years earlier, {{he was one of the}} first five players elected to the hall. As radio broadcasts of baseball games became popular, Ruth sought a job in that field, arguing that his celebrity and knowledge of baseball would assure large audiences, but he received no offers. During World War II, he made many personal appearances to advance the war effort, including his last appearance as a player at Yankee Stadium, in a 1943 exhibition for the Army-Navy Relief Fund. He hit a long fly ball off Walter Johnson; the blast left the field, curving foul, but Ruth circled the bases anyway. In 1946, he made a final effort to gain a job in baseball when he contacted new Yankees boss MacPhail, but he was sent a rejection letter.|$|E

On June 29, IDF combat engineers and Shabak agents, acting on intelligence, found Asheri's body in an abandoned car in an open field outside of Ramallah. The youth {{appeared to have been}} shot to death, and findings indicated that he may have been killed as early as Sunday, casting doubt on the PRC's earlier claims that he was alive and kept in captivity.|$|E
25|$|Oedipus {{was the son}} of Laius and Jocasta, {{king and}} queen of Thebes. Having been childless for some time, Laius {{consulted}} the Oracle of Apollo at Delphi. The Oracle prophesied that any son born to Laius <b>would</b> <b>kill</b> <b>him.</b> In an attempt to prevent this prophecy's fulfillment, when Jocasta indeed bore a son, Laius had his ankles pierced and tethered together so that he could not crawl; Jocasta then gave the boy to a servant to abandon ("expose") on the nearby mountain. However, rather than leave the child to die of exposure, as Laius intended, the servant passed the baby on to a shepherd from Corinth and who then gave the child to another shepherd.|$|E
25|$|Though freely {{sharing his}} {{knowledge}} of the occult and occasionally using his powers, Seishirō obscures his true identity and personal details. After a year passes and Subaru finally realises his love for Seishirō, but at this point Seishirō reveals he is the Sakurazukamori, Japan's top one assassin. Having become the Sakurazukamori, Seishirō was supposed to kill the young Subaru when being found by him. Impressed with kid's purity, Seishirō made a bet with him: Should Seishirō come to love him after living a year with him he would spare him and otherwise he <b>would</b> <b>kill</b> <b>him.</b> As a result, he almost kills the young onmyōji, but Subaru's grandmother intervenes to free him from the illusion, leaving herself crippled as a result.|$|E

25|$|Emir Yusuf rallied his Druze {{forces to}} {{dislodge}} al-Jazzar, but {{the latter was}} able, through bribes, to manipulate the deeply factional Druze clans against each other and stave off Emir Yusuf's attempts. Emir Yusuf then sought to form an alliance with Zahir to oust al-Jazzar, gaining Emir Yusuf the enmity of al-Wakil. A punitive expedition sent by al-Wakil targeting Emir Yusuf in September 1773 was repelled by Zahir. Zahir's success prompted Emir Yusuf to seek {{the assistance of the}} Russian fleet by appealing to Zahir, the Russians' ally, to intercede with the Russians on Emir Yusuf's behalf. The Russians agreed to the request and began bombarding Beirut on 2 August. Al-Jazzar initially refused to surrender despite the heavy naval bombardment. However, after the Russians managed to land artillery pieces near Beirut and cut the city off by land, al-Jazzar decided to surrender to Zahir, four months after the siege. Fearing that Emir Yusuf <b>would</b> <b>kill</b> <b>him</b> in custody, al-Jazzar only agreed to surrender if placed in Zahir's custody because the latter promised to protect him and his Maghrebi garrison.|$|E
25|$|Kelly's first {{documented}} {{brush with}} the law was on 15 October 1869 {{at the age of}} 14 when he was charged with the assault and robbery of Ah Fook, a pig and fowl trader of Chinese descent from Bright. According to Fook, as he was passing Kelly's house, Kelly approached him with a long bamboo stick, announcing that he was a bushranger and <b>would</b> <b>kill</b> <b>him</b> if he did not hand over his money. Kelly then allegedly took him into the bush, beat him with the stick and stole 10 shillings. According to Kelly, his sister Annie and two witnesses, Bill Skilling and Bill Grey, Annie was sitting outside the house sewing when Fook walked up and asked for a drink of water. Given creek water, he abused Annie for not giving him rain water, and Kelly came outside and pushed him. Fook then hit Kelly three times with the bamboo stick, causing him to run away. The visitor then walked away, threatening to return and burn the house down, and Kelly did not return until sundown. Historians find neither account convincing and believe that Kelly's account is likely true up to being hit by Fook but then Kelly probably took the stick from him and beat him with it.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, late {{at night}} on Tuesday, May 7, a 45-year-old black man named Herbert Thomas was flagged down by a {{hitchhiker}} in Kilgore. The man said that he needed a ride to Henderson because his mother was seriously ill and offered $5. Thomas {{said that he would}} not have given the man a ride but felt like he needed to because the man told such a sad story. When they neared Henderson, the man pulled out a pistol and told Thomas to keep driving or he <b>would</b> <b>kill</b> <b>him</b> like the five people he killed in Texarkana, mentioning Paul Martin and Betty Jo Booker by name. The man told Thomas that he was not done killing and was planning on killing more. He {{said he was going to}} return to Texarkana and kill Martin's father. The suspect apparently did not know that Martin's father was already dead. The man then made Thomas stop in Lufkin and told him to drive back to Kilgore and that if he followed him, he would trail him and kill him. The man stole back the $5 as well as an additional $3. Thomas drove back to Kilgore and reported the incident to the police. Thomas described the man as being 5'8, about 130pounds, approximately 27 or 28 years old, with red hair and wore khaki trousers and a GI jacket.|$|E
