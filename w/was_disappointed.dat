5|$|For XIII-2, Game Informers Joe Juba <b>was</b> <b>disappointed</b> that Lightning {{had been}} {{transferred}} to a supporting role in favor of Serah and Hope, whom he saw as weaker characters than Lightning. Simon Parkin of Eurogamer found that the story suffers without {{the driving force of}} Lightning's single-minded determination. VanOrd <b>was</b> <b>disappointed</b> that Lightning and Caius Ballad have relatively limited screen-time, since they come off as stronger characters than the protagonists.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1891, Berkman {{learned that}} Russian anarchist Peter Kropotkin, whom he admired, had {{canceled}} an American speaking tour {{on the basis that}} it was too expensive for the struggling anarchist movement. While Berkman <b>was</b> <b>disappointed,</b> the frugality of the action further elevated Kropotkin's stature in his eyes.|$|E

5|$|Shyamalan {{admitted}} he <b>was</b> <b>disappointed</b> by the reaction Unbreakable {{received from the}} public and critics. Shyamalan also disliked Touchstone Pictures' marketing campaign.

5|$|Although Brumund's {{publication}} included {{drawings of}} Borobudur, the Batavia Society still {{felt that it}} was incomplete. In April 1873, van Kinsbergen set off to the monument. Cleaning, digging and other technical difficulties delayed his start in taking pictures until August that year. The wet monsoon season further hampered his work, resulting in a series of only 43 photographs taken between August to December. The Society <b>was</b> <b>disappointed</b> with the number of photographs, although satisfied with the printing and artistic quality.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{was also}} {{concerned}} with easing overland {{transport of goods}} to Virginia. In mid-1795, he, Robert Barr, Elijah Craig, and Harry Toulmin formed a committee {{to raise funds for}} a road connecting the Cumberland Gap to central Kentucky. Breckinridge <b>was</b> <b>disappointed</b> with the quality of the route, which was finished in late 1796, concluding that the individual maintaining it was keeping most of the tolls instead of using them for the road's upkeep.|$|E
5|$|Elements of {{the game}} were criticized. Sullivan found some side {{missions}} repetitive, and Sliwinski <b>was</b> <b>disappointed</b> {{with some of the}} boss battles. Miller wrote that some Shadow of Mordor features are too complex and inaccessible for new players or those unwilling to use strategy. Critics disagreed about the Nemesis system. Miller wrote that the system fell flat in the game's final hours; according to VanOrd, the system was unappealing until the game's second half. Carter found the unskippable cutscenes after a player died annoying.|$|E

5|$|In 1852 Staunton {{published}} his book The Chess Tournament, which recounted {{in detail the}} efforts required to make the London International Tournament happen and presented all the games with his comments on the play.

Though he gave his consent, his father <b>was</b> <b>disappointed</b> that his second son did not do more to advance the concerns of Coburg. The marriage did not produce any issue, though Ernest apparently fathered at least three illegitimate children in later years.|$|E
5|$|James Villiers as MI6 Chief of Staff Bill Tanner. The role of Tanner first {{appeared}} on film in The Man with the Golden Gun, although in an un-credited capacity.

5|$|Johnson's primary {{interest}} lay {{in improving}} the state's mental and penal institutions. These improvements began under Governor Chandler, and while Johnson stated that the mental hospitals and prisons were in their best condition in forty years {{by the end of}} his term, he <b>was</b> <b>disappointed</b> that he was not able to do more. In light of the financial obligations brought about by World War II, he had to curb state construction.|$|E
5|$|Kristoff, meanwhile, {{expressed}} {{disappointment with}} his second-place finish and {{his failure to}} defend his 2014 title. He suggested that another rider in the final part of the race could have given a better result, as Paolini's tiredness after a long spell {{at the front of}} the race meant that Kristoff had to start his sprint too early. Michael Matthews's third-place finish was the most significant result of his career, but he too <b>was</b> <b>disappointed</b> at having fallen short, after feeling strong on the climb of the Poggio.|$|E
5|$|Lee {{took the}} Korea Open {{title for the}} third time. A week later, he {{captured}} his ninth Malaysia Open title, which broke the record of eight titles previously held by Wong Peng Soon.
