5|$|In {{these early}} years, Harrison also earned {{money from his}} {{contributions}} to a biography written by James Hall, entitled A Memoir of the Public Services of William Henry Harrison, published in 1836. That year, he made an unsuccessful {{run for the presidency}} as a Whig candidate. Between 1836 and 1840, Harrison served as Clerk of Courts for Hamilton County. This <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>job</b> when he was elected president in 1840. About this time, Harrison met African-American abolitionist and Underground Railroad conductor George DeBaptiste who lived in nearby Madison. The two became friends, and DeBaptiste became his personal servant, staying with Harrison until his death. By 1840, when Harrison campaigned for president a second time, over a dozen books had been published on his life. He was hailed by many as a national hero.|$|E

Cmdr Lane had previously been CO of an Admiralty torpedo establishment and received an award in 1959 from the Admiralty in connection with an invention related to torpedoes, and torpedo development <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>job.</b> The Report stated that Dolphin may {{have been influenced by}} that award to make his own claim.|$|E

An ad hoc U.S. Air Force unit called the Raven Forward Air Controllers was founded to direct the swelling tide of airpower being unleashed in support of the Hmong and other irregulars. Rather than continuing to craft a strategy to defend Laos, the new emphasis in the war became the support of the combat in South Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|At {{one point}} in the proceedings, Smith {{attempted}} to press a point he was making, by quoting from a signal sent to British ships. Lord Mersey queried which message this was, and it transpired that the message in question existed in the version of evidence given to Smith by the Board of Trade Solicitor, Sir Ellis Cunliffe, but not in versions given to others. Cunliffe explained the discrepancy by saying that different versions of the papers had been prepared for use, depending whether the enquiry had been in camera or not, but the message quoted appeared never to have existed. Lord Mersey observed that it <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>job</b> to get at the truth, and thereafter became more critical of Admiralty evidence.|$|E

500|$|As War Secretary, Benjamin was {{responsible}} for a territory stretching from Virginia to Texas. [...] It <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>job,</b> with Davis looking over his shoulder, to supervise the Confederate Army and to feed, supply, and arm it—in a nascent country with almost no arms manufacturers. [...] Accordingly, Benjamin saw his job as closely tied to foreign affairs, as the Confederacy was dependent on imports to supply its troops. Davis had determined on a [...] "defensive war" [...] strategy—the Confederacy would await invasion by the North, then seek to defeat its armies until Lincoln tired of sending them. Davis and Benjamin worked together closely, and as Davis {{came to realize that}} his subordinate was loyal both to the Confederacy and to Davis personally, he returned complete trust in Benjamin. [...] Varina Davis wrote, [...] "It was to me a curious spectacle, the steady approximation to a thorough friendliness of the President and his War Minister. [...] It was a very gradual rapprochement, but all the more solid for that reason." ...|$|E

2500|$|That evening, angry {{youths in}} republican districts burnt hijacked {{vehicles}} and attacked the RUC. Immediately after the attack, {{the two main}} loyalist paramilitary groups—the UDA and the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF)—denied responsibility. The leader of the UDA West Belfast Brigade, Tommy Lyttle, said that Stone was a rogue loyalist acting without orders from the UDA, {{although he did not}} condemn the attack. Lyttle told other UDA leaders to keep to this line. UDA member Sammy Duddy said: [...] "After Milltown, two UDA brigadiers from two Belfast battalions telephoned the IRA to say they didn't know Michael Stone [...] But Michael was UDA, he was a travelling gunman who went after the IRA and Republicans and he needed no authority for that because that <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>job.</b> Those two brigadiers were scared in case the IRA would retaliate against them [...] so they disclaimed Michael, one of our best operators".|$|E

2500|$|There {{was another}} member of the {{expedition}} whose presence conforms still less to this hypothesis: the Veedor ("Overseer" [...] or [...] "Supervisor") Bernardino Íñiguez. This public office had functions that we would now call fiscal and administrative. It <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>job</b> to count the treasure gathered by the expeditions, in metals and precious stones, in order to assure the correct allotment of the quinto real [...] the [...] "royal fifth": 20% of all treasure gained in the conquests was destined for the Spanish royal treasury, a fiscal norm that originated in the Reconquista, the re-conquest of Spain from the Muslims [...] and of other legal requisites, such as reading to the Indians, before attacking them, a declaration of intentions and a warning, to legalize the aggression in the face of possible future investigations. (Cortés was especially scrupulous with this formal requirement, useless when one lacked interpreters who could translate the message to the Indians). If the expedition went to Guanajes to kidnap Indians, the Veedors presence would have been downright inconvenient for them. Although, on the other hand, according to Bernal, Íñiguez was nothing but a soldier who carried out the role of veedor, his being so designated in advance indicates that there was at least some thought of the possibility of exploration.|$|E
2500|$|Barruels third volume {{addresses}} the antisocial conspiracy {{that was the}} objective of the Freemasons and the Order of the Illuminati. The philosophes and their attacks against the church and the throne {{paved the way for the}} conspiracy that was led by these secret societies. These groups were believed to have constituted a single sect that numbered over 300,000 members who were [...] "all zealous for the Revolution, and all ready to rise at the first signal and to impart the shock to all others classes of the people". Barruel surveyed the history of Masonry and maintained that its higher mysteries had always been of an atheist and republican cast. He believed the Freemasons kept their words and aims secret for many years but on August 12, 1792, two days after the fall of the French monarchy, they ran though the streets openly announcing their secrets. The secret words were [...] "Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity" [...] and the secret aim was the overthrow of the French monarchy and the establishment of the republic. Barruel claimed he heard them speak these words in France but that in other countries the Masons still kept their secrets. A division of the group into numerous lodges ensured that if the secrets of one lodge were discovered, the rest would remain hidden. He believed that it <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>job</b> to warn all governments and people of the goals of the Freemasons. Barruel described in detail how this system worked in the case of the Illuminati. Even after Johann Adam Weishaupt, the leader of the sect, was discovered and tried in court, the proceedings could not uncover the universal influence of the Illuminati and no steps were taken against the group. The majority of the secret societies could always survive and carry on their activities because of the organization of the group. The Illuminati, as a whole, functioned to radicalize the movement against the throne and altar and influenced more members of the population to subscribe to their hidden principles. They refined the secret structure that had been provided by the Masons basic framework.|$|E

60|$|Wiborn, the Lone Angler, {{is also in}} a {{class by}} himself. To my mind Wiborn is the ideal angler of the sea. I have aspired to his method, but realize it is {{impossible}} for me. He goes out alone. Hence the name Lone Angler. He operates his motor-launch, rigs his tackle and bait and teasers, flies his kite, finds the fish, fights the one he hooks, and gaffs and hauls it aboard or releases it, all by himself. Any one who has had the slightest experience in Pacific angling can appreciate this hazardous, complicated, and laborsome job of the Lone Angler. Any one who ever fought a big tuna or swordfish can imagine where he would have been without a boatman. After some of my fights with fish Captain Danielson has been as tired as I <b>was.</b> <b>His</b> <b>job</b> had been as hard as mine. But Wiborn goes out day by day alone, and he has brought in big tuna and swordfish. Not many! He is too fine a sportsman to bring in many fish.|$|E
