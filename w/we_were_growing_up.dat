In a 1993 interview for The New York Times, Wiggins elaborated on their direction for the album, stating [...] "We're paying homage to a lot of older artists who paved the way for us artists like the Temptations, Sly and the Family Stone, Earth, Wind and Fire. They're the people who inspired us when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up,</b> people like Aretha Franklin, James Brown. We feel we're the sons of everything and all those people who came before us." [...] He also explained the album's title as a declaration of them being descendants of those artists, [...] "not in a grandiose sense, but from the standpoint that we really are the musical offspring of all that's come before us... paying homage to our past, but creating in a contemporary environment." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bobby Gillespie of Primal Scream was {{inspired}} by both [...] "Happy House" [...] and [...] "Christine" [...] because they were pop songs with dark subject matter. He stated: [...] "That's the idea, yeah—to use the conventional way of constructing a pop song to communicate what I feel about the world and my take on relationships. It's a twist that makes it darker than it seems. When <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up,</b> Siouxsie and the Banshees were {{doing this kind of}} stuff—they were getting in the charts with songs about mental hospitals! [...] "Happy House"? That was nearly number fucking 10 in the charts! 'Christine, the strawberry girl, Christine, banana split lady'—they were writing about a girl with schizophrenia! They were getting in pop magazines and on TV; they were getting played on daytime radio. It's fucking subversive! They were outsiders bringing outsider subjects to the mainstream".|$|E

When <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up,</b> we saw it sort of first hand. A lot of our friends were pushed into doing jobs their parents were telling them to do. It's about being pushed around and told how to live your life and standing up for yourself." ...|$|E

5000|$|The Gaddises {{were not}} only {{dedicated}} to service to the United States of America, they were devoted to family. In the unpublished memoir Gaddis wrote in 2009, he stated: [...] “Hazel and I tried our best to be thinkers and planners. We wanted to give our children and their children more opportunities than we had while <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up.</b> Although world events, over which we had no control, played a huge role in our lives; nevertheless, we tried {{to stay focused on}} our goals.

5000|$|When <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> {{we listened}} to Tartak, TNMK, Druha Rika, Dymna Sumish, Krykhitka Tsakhes, Okean Elzy, BoomBox. If talking about {{examples}} to follow, Andriy Hlyvniuk was no doubt an authority for us. And we strongly respect his as an author, musician and frontman. Svyatoslav Vakarchuk shows on his example that this is possible to remain popular for 20 years. That is very wonderful. I like the band SINOPTIK, which on its example also shows that they keep {{in step with the}} world music....The biggest authority and mentor, a man, with whom I wanted to keep on working, listen to the advices and always talk to, was Andriy Kuzmenko from the band Skryabin.|$|E
5000|$|Martin is {{very vocal}} about {{his love for}} Norwegian new wave/Synthpop band a-ha. In 2005 he stated the {{following}} in an interview: [...] "I found myself in Amsterdam {{the other day and}} I put a-has first record on. I just remembered how much I loved it. Its incredible songwriting. Everyone asks what inspired us, what weve been trying to steal from and what we listened to as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> - the first band I ever loved was a-ha." [...] Martin has also performed live together with Magne Furuholmen of a-ha, introducing him as [...] "the best keyboard player in the world". In November 2011, he stated that [...] "back when we didnt have any hits of our own we used to play a-ha songs." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{was during}} the sixth winter in our cave that Lop-Ear and I {{discovered}} that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> really <b>growing</b> <b>up.</b> From the first {{it had been a}} squeeze to get in through the entrance-crevice. This had had its advantages, however. It had prevented the larger Folk from taking our cave away from us. And it was a most desirable cave, the highest on the bluff, the safest, and in winter the smallest and warmest.|$|R

5000|$|Their Influences include Faith No More, Mr. Bungle, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Alice in Chains, Ani DiFranco, Stone Temple Pilots, Primus, Fishbone, Suicidal Tendencies, Beastie Boys, Soundgarden, Rage Against the Machine, The Police and Jane's Addiction. Boyd {{reflected}} on the band's initial influences in 2012, stating [...] "At that time early '90s music got turned on its ear. We were listening to bands like Primus, Mr. Bungle, John Zorn, we also got into Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine. What’s amazing is those bands are still good now, they’re still relevant now. Alice in Chains, Red Hot Chili Peppers, these bands that were coming of age right when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up,</b> at that most important, kind of pliable time in your youth. We were basically so inspired by music, that we decided to make music on our own.” Critics have compared Boyd's deep-voiced style of singing to Faith No More/Mr. Bungle vocalist Mike Patton, whom the band have also credited as a major influence.|$|E

40|$|OURS IS {{an age of}} {{globalization}} in which our nation {{is not only the}} country in which <b>we</b> <b>are</b> born, <b>grow</b> <b>up,</b> and live, but also the entire earth itself; in which ???each of us dwells, in effect, in two communities ??? the local community of our birth, and the community of human argument and aspiration that ???is truly great and truly common, in which we look neither to this corner nor to that, but measure the boundaries of our nation by the sun?????? (Nussbaum, 1997, 6). It is one in which, in Kant???s words, ???The peoples of the earth has thus entered in varying degrees into a universal community, and it has developed to the point where a violation of rights {{in one part of the}} earth is felt all over it [the earth]??? (Kant, 1972, 142). Ours is an age in which concepts such as basic human rights and crimes against humanity are among those that express most characteristically the spirit of the time. In short, ours is an age of cosmopolitanism. The ideal of cosmopolitanism is that the time will dawn when ???the first form of moral affiliation for the citizen should be her affiliation with rational humanity??? (Nussbaum, 1997, 5); an important legal norm on the earth is the norm of humanity. Cosmopolitanism affirms the Kantian motto: out of the crooked timber of humanity, nothing straight can be built. It rekindles the light of the Confucian ideal of Tian Xia Gui Ren (????????????) ???that is, the world will be united by the norm of humanity...|$|R
5000|$|... "It was a track D-Moet Produced for Foxy Brown, and she didn't {{want the}} record, she didn't like it. It fit with my album, I Am..., so I did the D-Moet track {{and it sounded}} perfect for Puff to be on, so I gave it to him, went to the studio, and he rocked it, knocked it out. I wanted him to talk that shit on there, because that [...] "Victory" [...] record was my {{favorite}} record, with him and B.I.G., and I just wanted him to talk some of his shit on there. I had him screaming {{a whole bunch of}} wild shit on here, and cats were slam-dancing to it in New York. It was really crazy, out of this world. At that point, I started wearing a huge chain, and I think me and Puff at that point started that bling shit and took it to the next level, and we did the video, and it was out of this world.There's a play in New York City where a black man played Jesus, and caught a lot of flak. I think, even the mayor at the time, Giuliani, was against it. So my thing was I wanted to be crucified like Jesus in the video, to get back at all those people that don't want to see a black man doing his thing. Me and Puff got hammered to the cross, but after Puff expressed his religious beliefs and speaking to his pastor, he wasn't ready to take that stance, so it was really my idea anyway, so we took his part out. For some reason, I think former manager Steve Stoute let it fly with Puffy still being crucified to the cross, so there was that fight at the office, where Puff jumped on Steve or some shit like that. Both of them were friends of mine, so I kind of stepped in and squashed the whole thing, and it's all in the past. Just <b>growing</b> pains. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> all <b>growing</b> <b>up.</b> That brings back a lot of memories. Even when I throw it on onstage now, it still kills." ...|$|R
50|$|According to Martin (1976), the Dagombas {{pushed back}} the Konkomba and {{established}} divisional chiefs among them. The main towns had {{the character of}} outposts, strategically located on the east bank of the River Oti but Bikpakpaam {{were by no means}} assimilated. Relations between them and the Dagombas were distant and hostile. There was little, if any, mixing by marriage. Part of the oral history of the creation of Dagbon suggests that the Dagombas conquered Bikpakpaam when they moved into {{the eastern part of the}} Northern Region. Bikpakpaam however have vehemently and consistently refused the claim that they were in the battle against Dagombas. The Konkomba have often insisted that they voluntarily moved away, in search for fertile lands and greener pastures for their livestock, when Dagombas arrived. David Tait (1964) quotes an elder of Bikpakpaam as saying “When <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> and met our fathers, they told us they (our forefathers) stayed in Yaan/Chare (Yendi) with the Kabre and Bikwom. The Dagombas at the time lived mainly in Tamale and Kumbungu from where they rose, mounted their horses and moved towards Yendi”. We saw the horses and had to move further east.|$|E
5000|$|As of 2016, {{the sisters}} {{are in their}} mid-thirties and enjoy a {{reputation}} as popular female flautists in India. Concerning this, Suchismita says: [...] "I think it {{is due to a}} lack of prominent women flautists that girls these days don't think of it as an instrument to be played by women... We had no woman role model when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up.</b> One of the things we can do to change that is teach other children ourselves". To that end, the sisters have worked with several organisations, like the Society for the Promotion of Indian Classical Music and Culture Amongst Youth, to give interactive performances for students in order for them to learn about India's musical heritage. In January 2014, the sisters gave a presentation combining talk and musical demonstrations at a cultural programme organized by the Symbiosis Institute of Mass Communications of Pune. They consider the flute to be [...] "a full-fledged member of the Indian classical music family". The sisters hold that at its root, the flute is a folk instrument with a history embedded by legends of the Mahabharata period when Krishna wooed gopis with his bansuri or flute.|$|E

He was one of seven children, and at the age of ten he was taken out of school and sent to Nicosia to work as a shop assistant for his uncle. He lived and worked with his uncle’s family until his twenties, when he was able to open his own shop, selling materials for making clothes and other items for the home.

40|$|Children witness {{violence}} in the home {{in a number of}} different ways. They may see or hear the abusive episode, will experience the aftermath, and sense the tension in the build-up to the abuse. Even when the parents believe the children were unaware of what was happening, the children can often give detailed accounts of the events. Quite apart from possible physical involvement or direct abuse, these emotionally damaging actions have a detrimental and often long-lasting effect on the children. This research focuses on the problem field of Domestic violence as a devastating social problem that impacts every segment of the population. Primary system responses are principally targeted toward adult victims of this violence and abuse. However recent increased attention is now being focused on the children who witness domestic violence. Children are often the 'forgotten victims' of Domestic violence and abuse. They are affected not only by directly witnessing abuse. But also by living in an environment where one of their parent, who usually is the main caregiver, is being repeatedly victimised. Children in a home where one parent is being abused are also at a risk of being abused themselves. Number of factors comes into play as far as the extent to which children exposed to domestic violence are affected. Age and gender, how much they witness and whether or not they are personally involved in the abuse, their personality, among others will play a role in this regard. Children who live with domestic violence are exposed to increased risks. Among others, the risk of exposure to traumatic events and the risk of losing one or both of their parents. These have the potential to lead to negative outcomes for children and affect their well-being, and stability. Children who have had exposure to domestic violence are likely to experience any or all of the following problems: emotional; behavioural; cognitive and attitudinal; physical; and long-term problems. Children's risk levels and reactions to domestic violence exist on a continuum where some children demonstrate enormous resiliency while others show signs of significant maladaptive adjustment. This has the ability and potential to lead to very serious psychological trauma with possible long-term effects, affecting not only the child's well-being during or shortly after the violence. But affecting the child's ability to build and maintain healthy relationships in his/her adult life. There is no classic of conceptual understanding and treatment of traumatized and troubled children. There is no archetypal therapeutic practice for traumatised children buttressed by pastoral counselling, forming a framework of shared assumptions, practices, and interpretive ideas. One suspects that the many clergypersons who seek to work with and help such children are struggling to find their way, with little to guide them and certainly no comprehensive model with which to work. This research does not seek to become a manual to aid clergy in helping traumatized children. But a navigation tool for the clergypersons who journeys with this young ones. The research will give attention to the issue of domestic violence, and provide a stark reminder that domestic violence breeds discomfort, disrupts normal life, especially in children. Furthermore the focus of this research is that domestic violence leaves a child traumatized. Thus the purpose here is inter alia, to reach out to such traumatized child as well as tapping into a child’s world; and to find healing for the traumatized child. A Childhood Lost I am the eldest one of three I have two brothers younger than me When <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> our lives were sad Living at home with our mum and dad We had no money and very little food He spent it on drink and came home in a mood The teachers at my school said how well I did They must have known the secrets I hid How may pairs of glasses can one woman break? The bruises, the marks, the lives at stake That's why we slept out on the streets at night For me it was safer, so we used to take flight Away from the man supposed to protect Out into the darkness, did anyone suspect? For if we stayed I knew what it would mean A beating for mum would be heard or seen I envied my friends, they had happy lives With dads who actually loved their wives I am now older with kids of my own My dad's 56 and now lives alone He lost his kids, his home and his wife He's dying of cancer, now he's losing his life He’s no longer scary, he's no longer bad He's a Grandad who's dying, but he's still my dad. ~ T.
