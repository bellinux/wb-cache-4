30|$|Our paper {{contributes}} to the literature on earnings inequality by considering the role of hours worked and not only that of hourly wages, in order to address the question of whether, for a given distribution of <b>wages,</b> the <b>dispersion</b> of working time tends to dampen or magnify initial inequalities. To do so, we decompose our inequality index to quantify the contribution of inequality in hourly <b>wages</b> and the <b>dispersion</b> in hours worked to overall inequality in earnings. Hours dispersion affects overall inequality through two mechanisms, inequality in hours and the correlation between hours worked and hourly wages. As a result, if the latter term is negative (i.e., if poorly paid workers are those that work most), hours inequality may have a substantial equalizing impact.|$|R

50|$|The terms {{compensation}} differential, pay differential, {{and wage}} differential (see <b>wage</b> <b>dispersion</b> or economic inequality) {{are also used}} in economics, but normally have a different meaning.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} openness on wages in developing countries and developed economies separately using the ILO’s October Inquiry data for wages. The findings suggest that in developing countries increased openness will not enhance wage rates directly although they may do so via growth, and may even produce (temporary) declines in real wage rates, as well as increase <b>dispersions</b> across <b>wage</b> rates. If openness generates economic growth it could allow some recovery of wages from the initial damage. However, it is quite clear that despite {{the positive effect of}} openness on growth, and that of growth on wages, the recovery from initial damage on the wage regime may not quite proceed in to full fledged enhancement of real wages in the developing world. While the explanation for the initial shock on real wages in the developing world {{may have something to do}} with sectoral demand shifts and their effects on wages, it may also importantly lie in the effect that increased openness has on inflation in the short run. On the other hand, in the developed world, wage earners in general will gain in the medium run with enhanced trade openness, and <b>wage</b> <b>dispersions</b> in these countries will not increase as a result.

40|$|This study {{presents}} some stylised {{facts on}} wage growth differentials across the euro area {{countries in the}} years before and in the first eight years after the introduction of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in 1999. The study shows that <b>wage</b> growth <b>dispersion,</b> i. e. the degree of difference in wage growth at a given point in time, has been on a clear downward trend since the early 1980 s. However, <b>wage</b> growth <b>dispersion</b> across the euro area countries still appears to be higher than the degree of <b>wage</b> growth <b>dispersion</b> within West Germany, the United States, Italy and Spain. Differences in wage growth rates between individual euro area countries and the euro area {{in the years before}} and in the first eight years after the introduction of EMU appear to be positively related to the respective differences between their Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) inflation and average HICP inflation in the euro area. Conversely, relative wage growth differentials across euro area countries have been somewhat unrelated to relative productivity growth differentials. Some countries combine positive wage growth differentials and negative productivity growth differentials vis- 0 -vis the euro area average over an extended period 2 ̆ 013 and hence positive unit labour cost growth differentials. These countries run the risk of accumulating competitiveness losses and it is therefore a challenge to ensure that the necessary adjustment mechanisms operate fully, in the sense that wage developments are sufficiently flexible and reflect productivity developments. Wage growth persistence within individual euro area countries 2 ̆ 013 largely reflecting inflation persistence and certain institutional factors 2 ̆ 013 might also have contributed somewhat to wage growth differentials across the euro area countries. Moreover, wage level convergence has also played a role in explaining wage growth patterns in the 1980 s and the 1990 s. However, since 1999, the link between the initial compensation level and the subsequent growth rate of compensation per employee appears barely significant. The study also shows a limited co-movement of wage growth across countries, even {{in the context of a}} high degree of business cycle synchronisation seen in the last few years. This suggests that the impact on wage growth of country-specific developments across euro area countries has been larger than the impact of common cyclical developments and external shocks. This could reflect the normal and desirable working of adjustment mechanisms, which 2 ̆ 013 in an optimally functioning currency union with synchronised business cycles 2 ̆ 013 would take place via price and cost and wage developments. On the other hand, structural impediments, for example a relatively low degree of openness in domestically-oriented sectors in some countries, might prevent a stronger link between the degree of synchronisation of wage growth rates and business cycles...|$|R

40|$|In Chapter 1, I study an {{infinitely}} repeated {{moral hazard}} problem {{in which the}} principal privately observes and publicly reports the agent 2 ̆ 7 s output, as in Fuchs (2007). The role of the agent 2 ̆ 7 s private strategies, which depend {{on the history of}} his private efforts, is examined in providing incentives for the principal to be truthful. I show that in order for his effort history to work as an incentive device, the agent has to use a mixed strategy, since otherwise his efforts are predictable by the principal and thus, in effect, public information. However, hiding the agent 2 ̆ 7 s efforts from the principal incurs a non-negligible efficiency loss, which may, or may not be justified by the efficiency gain from the use of the agent 2 ̆ 7 s private strategies. Moreover, the agent 2 ̆ 7 s optimal strategy is shown to be consistent with empirical studies on how employees respond to subjective performance evaluations. In Chapter 2, we studies an equilibrium model of the labor market with moral hazard in which jobs are dynamic contracts, job separations are terminations of optimal dynamic contracts, and terminations are used as an incentive device. Transitions from unemployment to new jobs are modeled as a process of matching and bargaining. Non-employed workers make consumption and saving decisions as in a typical growth model, but they must also {{decide whether or not to}} participate in the labor market. The equilibrium of the model is characterized. We then calibrate the model to the U. S. labor market to study quantitatively worker turnover, compensation dynamics and distribution.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the impact of <b>wage</b> <b>dispersion</b> on {{sickness}} absenteeism observed in Belgian firms. Design/methodology/approach – The authors use detailed linked employer-employee panel data for the period 1999 - 2006 that allow the authors to compute a conditional <b>wage</b> <b>dispersion</b> indicator following the Winter-Ebmer and Zweimüller (1999) methodology and to estimate the relationship between sickness absenteeism and <b>wage</b> <b>dispersion</b> while controlling for time-invariant workplace characteristics. Findings – The authors find a positive and hump-shaped relationship between intra-firm <b>wage</b> <b>dispersion</b> and sickness absenteeism, the turning point of this relation being extremely high. In addition, the magnitude of the influence of <b>wage</b> <b>dispersion</b> on sickness absenteeism is found to be stronger in firms employing a larger share of blue-collar workers. Practical implications – The results could therefore suggest that <b>wage</b> <b>dispersion,</b> suggestive of larger pay-for-performance mechanisms, decreases worker satisfaction and the workplace climate in general. Only a minority of workers, who are less sensitive to equity and cohesion considerations, would be less absent as pay-for-performance increases. Originality/value – While numerous approaches analyse the link between <b>wage</b> <b>dispersion</b> and firm productivity, very few studies we are aware of are devoted to the relationship between <b>wage</b> <b>dispersion</b> and sickness absenteeism. Yet, the outcomes in terms of productivity and sickness absenteeism may be different. Furthermore, the influence of <b>wage</b> <b>dispersion</b> on sickness absenteeism does not seem unambiguous from a theoretical point of view.
