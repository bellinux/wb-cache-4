[...] This use of Helen as a mythological exemplum might be seen as problematic: after all, Helen is the most beautiful mortal, and yet Sappho has her judging Paris to be the most beautiful. [...] Harold Zellner explains this apparent paradox {{as an integral part of}} the argument that Sappho makes that the most beautiful is the one that one loves: the apparent contradiction between Helen being the most beautiful, and Helen finding Paris the most beautiful, can be resolved if <b>we</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Sappho's definition of beauty.|$|E

2500|$|While Overbeck did {{not live}} to see his dream successful, {{the idea of a}} Western Orthodox church did not disappear. The early part of the twentieth century was {{characterized}} by a series of false starts. In 1911, Arnold Harris Matthew (a former Roman Catholic priest, later consecrated an Old Catholic bishop), entered into union with the Oriental Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch under Metropolitan Gerasimos (Messarah) of Beirut and, in 1912, with the Eastern Orthodox Pope Photios of Alexandria. Bishop Mathew's 1909 [...] who wrote: [...] "...We have thanked God...that you omit the Filioque clause, and that you do not accept money for celebrating Masses. [...] <b>We</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> you as to the observance of your autonomy, and of the Latin Rite in actual use, so long and so far as they agree with the Holy Dogmas and with the canonical ordinances of the Seven Oecumenical Synods, which form the basis of the Orthodox Faith." [...] Both unions were contracted in quick succession and only lasted for an effective period of a few months. Though the union was protested by the Archbishop of Canterbury to Photios and the Patriarch of Antioch, Matthew's group claimed that communion was never formally broken off.|$|E
