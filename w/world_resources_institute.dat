5000|$|Carbon neutral fuels {{are those}} that neither {{contribute}} to nor {{reduce the amount of}} carbon into the atmosphere. Before an agency can certify an organization or individual as carbon neutral, it is important to specify whether indirect emissions are included in the Carbon Footprint calculation. Most Voluntary Carbon neutral certifiers such as Standard Carbon in the US, require both direct and indirect sources to be reduced and offset. As an example, for an organization to be certified carbon neutral by Standard Carbon, it must offset all direct and indirect emissions from travel by 1 lb CO2e per passenger mile, and all non-electricity direct emissions 100%. [...] Indirect electrical purchases must be equalized either with offsets, or renewable energy purchase. This standard differs slightly from the widely used <b>World</b> <b>Resource</b> <b>Institute</b> and may be easier to calculate and apply.|$|R
5000|$|In 2007, Hammond {{and a team}} of {{researchers}} from the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Bank Group’s International Finance Corporation and the <b>World</b> <b>Resource</b> <b>Institute</b> concluded that poverty afflicts four billion people worldwide, many of whom are living in capitalistic countries or countries transitioning towards capitalism (Hammond et al. 2007). Poverty is defined as “those with incomes below $3,000 in local purchasing power” (Hammond et al. 2007:3). Based on this evidence, the lived experiences of most human beings is that they are living in countries practicing different degrees of capitalism, which has proven itself to be highly exclusive. The opening pages of the 2007 report by Hammond et al. reveal additional funding for the report came from Intel, Microsoft, Royal Dutch Shell and Visa International. This suggests that crony capitalism and inclusive capitalism may have overlapping interests.|$|R

25|$|Live food {{fish are}} often transported in tanks at high expense for an {{international}} market that prefers its seafood killed immediately before it is cooked. This process originally was started by Lindeye. Delivery of live fish without water is also being explored. While some seafood restaurants keep live fish in aquaria for display purposes or for cultural beliefs, the majority of live fish are kept for dining customers. The live food fish trade in Hong Kong, for example, is estimated to have driven imports of live food fish to more than 15,000 tonnes in 2000. Worldwide sales that year were estimated at US$400million, according to the <b>World</b> <b>Resources</b> <b>Institute.</b>|$|E
25|$|Rather than {{encouraging}} mutli-national {{businesses to}} meet the needs of the poor, some organizations such as iDE, the <b>World</b> <b>Resources</b> <b>Institute,</b> and the United Nations Development Programme began to focus on working directly with helping bottom-of-the-pyramid populations become local, small-scale entrepreneurs. Since so much of this population is engaged in agriculture, these NGOs have addressed market gaps that enable small-scale (i.e., plots less than 2 hectares) farmers to increase their production and find markets for their harvests. This is done by increasing the availability of farming equipment (e.g., pumps, tillers, seeders) and better quality seed and fertilizer, as well as expanding access for training in farming best practices (e.g., crop rotation).|$|E
30|$|There {{is a real}} {{potential}} that, if applied too broadly, the supply-side perspective {{could be used to}} justify tree-planting in areas with limited water supply. Ellison et al. support tree planting in Spain to increase precipitation (Ellison et al. 2012). This view runs contrary to a significant body of hydrological evidence from Spain (not to mention studies from comparable climates elsewhere in the world) that shows strong correlations between increased forest-cover and decreased water-supply (see for instance Buendia et al. 2016; Gallart and Llorens 2003). Supply-side thinking has the potential to reinforce calls for widespread tree-planting in Africa. Hydrologists and ecologists are already alarmed at proposals such as the <b>World</b> <b>Resource</b> <b>Institute</b> goal to “restore” 100 million hectares in Africa by planting trees because they fear these efforts will cause decreases in streamflow, as they have done in other regions (Jackson et al. 2005; Pittock et al. 2013; Bond 2016). Supply-side thinkers have mentioned some of these concerns (Ellison et al. 2012), but have said little about what regions would need revisions of policy and what regions should keep existing protocols.|$|R

30|$|This study {{sets out}} to verify the key {{predictors}} {{of the dynamics of}} the arable production per capita index, the arable production and permanent crop land and forest area at a national scale in Cameroon. To achieve this objective, data for twelve time series data variables spanning the period 1961 – 2000 were collected from Oxford University, the United Nations Development program, the World Bank, FAOSTAT and the <b>World</b> <b>Resource</b> <b>Institute.</b> The data were analysed using structural equation models (SEM) based on the two stage least square approach (2 SLS). To optimize the results, variables that showed high correlations were dropped because they will not add any new information into the models. The results show that the arable production per capita index is impacted more by population while the influence of rainfall on the arable production per capita index is weak. Arable production and permanent cropland on its part has as the main predictor arable production per capita index. Forest area is seen to be more vulnerable to trade in forest products and logging than any other variable. The models presented in this study are quite reliable because the p and t values are consistent and overall, these results are consistent with previous studies.|$|R

Summary Over the last two decades, China has introduced forest resources management reforms, aimed to protect forests and enhance rural livelihoods. As part of these reforms, some powers over forestry management have been decentralized to village-level institutions. However, this decentralization has so far failed to give local communities adequate control over forest resources, especially in areas like Yunnan, where the ethnic minority population is heavily dependent on these resources for its livelihood. Insufficient powers have been decentralized, the village-level institutions are not sufficiently accountable to the public, and some of the reforms designed to protect forest resources have had a negative impact on rural livelihoods...|$|R
40|$|Geographic {{information}} systems and remote sensing technologies {{have become an}} important tool for visualizing conservation management and developing solutions to problems associated with conservation. When multiple organizations separately develop spatial data representations of protected areas, implicit error arises due to variation between data sets. We used boundary data produced by three conservation organizations (International Union for the Conservation of Nature, <b>World</b> <b>Resource</b> <b>Institute,</b> and Uganda Wildlife Authority), for seven Ugandan parks, to study variation in the size represented {{and the location of}} boundaries. We found variation in the extent of overlapping total area encompassed by the three data sources, ranging from miniscule (0. 4 %) differences to quite large ones (9. 0 %). To underscore how protected area boundary discrepancies may have implications to protected area management, we used a landcover classification, defining crop, shrub, forest, savanna, and grassland. The total area in the different landcover classes varied most in smaller protected areas (those less than 329 km 2), with forest and cropland area estimates varying up to 65 %. The discrepancies introduced by boundary errors could, in this hypothetical case, generate erroneous findings and could {{have a significant impact on}} conservation, such as local-scale management for encroachment and larger-scale assessments of deforestation...|$|R

40|$|The World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and the <b>World</b> <b>Resource</b> <b>Institute</b> (WRI) set the scope-based carbon {{footprint}} accounting standards {{in which all}} possible supply-chain related indirect greenhouse gas emissions are captured. Although this {{carbon footprint}} accounting standards are widely used in regional policy making, there is little effort in analyzing the scope-based carbon footprints of nations using a multi-region input–output (MRIO) analysis in order to consider the role of global trade. This research aims to advance the body of knowledge on carbon footprint analysis of the manufacturing sectors with a holistic approach combining the WBCSD & WRI’s scope-based carbon footprint accounting standards with a time series MRIO framework. To achieve this goal, a global scope-based carbon footprint analysis of the Turkish manufacturing sectors has been conducted as a case study. We employed a time series MRIO analysis by using the World Input–Output Database on the world’s 40 largest economies covering 1440 economic sectors. The results showed that electricity, gas and water supply was the most dominant sector in the supply chains of the Turkish industrial sectors with the largest carbon footprint. On average, indirect emissions of the Turkish manufacturing industry {{are found to be}} higher than direct emissions during the period from 2000 to 2009.

A study by the <b>World</b> <b>Resource</b> <b>Institute</b> of material flows in a number of industrialised countries, showed that one half to three quarters of the annual material input to these societies was returned to the environment as waste within one year [1]. The international community started realising that resources are finite and that nature can no longer absorb the vast quantities of waste continually released to it. Achieving ‘zero waste’ will be a breakthrough strategy for a world in an environmental crisis, however, this is a highly challenging target in construction, but by involving and committing all stakeholders to reduce waste at source and developing efficient waste management strategies by reusing and recycling materials and components, can take the industry closer to the ‘zero waste’ vision, hence, moving from myth to reality. The aim of this chapter is to rethink construction waste management by re-engineering processes and practices to reduce construction waste at source. The chapter examines the concept of waste and definitions; discusses construction waste quantification and source evaluation; explores current thinking on construction waste research; and appraises the current construction waste management and minimisation status in the United Kingdom (UK) in terms of drivers and pressures for change, design and onsite practices, and challenges and enablers...|$|R
