5|$|Lek {{systems are}} known to exist among some populations of walruses. These males cluster around females and try to attract them with {{elaborate}} courtship displays and vocalizations. Lekking may also exist among California sea lions, South American fur seals, New Zealand sea lions and harbor seals. In some species, including elephant seals and grey seals, males will try to lay claim to the desired females and defend them from rivals. Elephant seal males establish dominance hierarchies with the highest ranking males—the alpha males—maintaining harems {{of as many as}} 30–100 females. These males commonly disrupt the copulations of their subordinates while they themselves can mount without inference. They will, however, break off mating to chase off a rival. Grey seal males usually claim a location among a cluster of females whose members may change over time. Male harp seals, crabeater seals and hooded seals follow and defend lactating females in their vicinity—usually one or two at a time,—and <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> reach estrus.|$|E
25|$|The Americans were {{supportive}} of Kỳ and his {{prosecution of the}} war against the communists, and they opposed Thi, regarding him as not being firm enough against communism. Thi did, however, have the support of Marine Lieutenant General Lewis Walt, who commanded American forces in I Corps and was the senior adviser to Thi's ARVN forces. This caused problems during the dispute. The dismissal caused widespread demonstrations in the northern provinces. Civil unrest grew, as civil servants, disaffected military personnel, and the working under-class joined the anti-government demonstrations led by the Buddhists. At first, Kỳ tried to ignore the demonstrations and <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> peter out, but the problem escalated and riots broke out in some places.|$|E
25|$|The {{first and}} only episode, The Taxidermist, follows Madison as she visits Leland White, a taxidermist, to {{question}} him about the Origami Killer. Finding his house empty, Madison breaks in and discovers an upstairs area containing several female corpses, stuffed and posed in various positions (including a freshly killed cadaver in a bathroom), which Leland created {{in order to satisfy}} his agalmatophilia fetish. After collecting information, Madison hears Leland's car return. From here the player's actions can lead to several different endings – she can surprise Leland and kill him, be killed herself and added to his collection, escape, or contact the police and <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> arrest Leland. Regardless of what happens, it becomes clear that he has no connection to the Origami murders.|$|E

25|$|During a game, {{players are}} given a pre-determined amount of {{reinforcement}} points, with which to purchase units with varying costs. Once the player deploys the units they purchase, they must wait 20 seconds {{for them to be}} airdropped to the field. If a unit is destroyed, the points are refunded to the player in order to allow them to bring in more units. During the single-player campaign, most missions vary what units the player can recruit, while some missions will offer the opportunity to recruit free units, though these cannot be replaced if destroyed. Each unit has strengths and weaknesses, such as mobile anti-air guns being most effective against enemy helicopters, and repair tanks being most effective at keeping vehicles and armor repaired. Each unit possesses a defensive ability, such as deploying smokescreens, while some units possess an offensive ability, such as marking targets for bombardment or using grenade launchers on enemy infantry. Once a unit's special ability(ies) has been spent, players must <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> recharge before they can be used again.|$|E
500|$|Swift {{began work}} on her third studio album Speak Now two years prior to its release in 2010. [...] "Sparks Fly" [...] was written by Swift when she was sixteen years old, prior the release of her eponymous album in 2006. She {{performed}} the song live during several bar shows [...] "of forty and fifty people". A recorded live performance of the song during one of her concerts made its way onto the internet in 2007. The song became a favorite among Swift's fans, leading Swift to rework the song and include it on Speak Now after having so many requested {{for it to be}} included on the album. Of the song, Swift said that: [...] "This is a song I wrote {{a few years ago and}} I have been working on it ever since. It's been awesome to see it change over the years. The fans have heard it before in concert, but there have been some really cool changes that I am very proud of and can't <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> hear." ...|$|E
500|$|Kaladze {{was limited}} to just six league {{appearances}} and 11 total appearances in the 2003–04 season. In the next season, Kaladze played just 19 Serie A matches and five in the Champions League as Milan finished as runners-up in both competitions. He was an unused substitute in that season's Champions League final, where Milan lost on penalties to Liverpool after a 3–3 draw. He {{was said to be}} frustrated with his lack of first-team options and a move to Chelsea, in exchange for Hernán Crespo or for £4 million, was widely reported. Kaladze himself said, [...] "I have agreed everything with the Chelsea management. Now it is necessary to <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> reach an agreement with Milan and I think I could become a Chelsea player next week." [...] Chelsea opted to sign Asier del Horno instead and Kaladze later declared himself [...] "glad" [...] that the deal fell through. On 30 June 2005, he extended his contract with Milan until 2010 and again on 4 September 2006, this time until 2011. In 2005–06, an injury to Paolo Maldini meant that Kaladze was moved back into the centre of defence, his favoured position. Milan finished third that season, although they would have finished second if there were no 2006 Italian football scandal which resulted in a 30-point deduction.|$|E

2500|$|In {{carrying}} out his crimes, Krajcir would travel to various towns {{that he had}} no connection to, stalk his victims, and then break into their homes and <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> arrive. [...] In 1977, Krajcir was released from prison after serving time for rape, and as a condition of his parole, he was required to enroll at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. [...] There, in 1981, he earned a degree in Administrative Justice with a minor in psychology.|$|E
2500|$|The {{dismissal}} caused widespread {{demonstrations in}} the northern provinces. Initially, the pro-Buddhist demonstrations in I Corps and Saigon were mild and orderly. However, the unrest steadily grew, as civil servants, disaffected military personnel, and the working under-class, in part upset with the economic problems, joined the anti-government demonstrations. At first, Prime Minister Kỳ {{tried to ignore the}} demonstrations and <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> peter out, and to do not fight the dissidents, so as to [...] "not to provide any martyrs". Thi was immensely popular in the Buddhist stronghold of Huế. A general strike had incapacitated 90% of Da Nang, the largest city in central Vietnam and the second biggest in the entire country. In Saigon, 10,000 attended a Buddhist rally to call for elections and civilian rule and the monks used Thi's dismissal to focus attention on the junta's rule.|$|E
2500|$|A {{month after}} its début, German troops were still panicking {{when confronted by}} the {{machines}} but on 28 September, a party of Germans attacked a bogged tank and managed {{to get on the}} roof, only to find that there was still no way to fire inside. Rifle-fire was seen to be futile and machine-gun fire appeared only to work only with S.m.K. bullets, when concentrated in one place. It was considered that a hand-grenade would be just as useless but that one with the heads of six more wired around it would have enough explosive power, if thrown against the tracks. Advice was to lie still rather than run and <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> go past, to be engaged by artillery of at least [...] calibre firing at close range. Passive defences such as road obstacles were suggested but not anti-tank ditches or mines.|$|E

2500|$|... "Scotland {{had lost}} both Tests against the All Blacks {{earlier in the}} season but the second, in Auckland, had been close: the Blacks just sneaked home by 21-18. Perhaps that persuaded people that, in the light of our Test series win over the French, we were favourites. Whoever made public that {{sentiment}} did us scant favour. We were lulled into {{a false sense of security}} and yet, on the day, we were also intimidated because we didn't play our natural game, preferring instead to sit back and <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> come at us. Also, we didn't kick well that day, particularly Michael Lynagh. I hardly saw the ball, and when I did I was clobbered. Not feeling the ball in my hands destroys me anyway; I cannot take it. That day we were more afraid of making a mistake, worrying about who we were playing against, rather than getting on with our own game. And when we did run it we were totally predictable. The Blacks knew the ball would head out to me when it was shifted, and so whenever I got it they hammed me." ...|$|E
