With the development of the transport industry output and commercial trade, Vehicle <b>weigh-in-motion</b> technology is playing a more and more important role. At the same time, the accuracy of the <b>weigh-in-motion</b> data has become the centre of attention.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} of measuring a bridge’s characteristic allowance for dynamic interaction {{in the form}} of Assessment Dynamic Ratio. Using a Bridge <b>Weigh-in-Motion</b> system, measurements were taken at a bridge in Slovenia over 58 days. From the total observed traffic population, 5 -axle trucks were extracted and studied. The Bridge <b>Weigh-in-Motion</b> system inferred the static weights of the trucks, giving each measured event’s dynamic increment of load. Theoretical simulations were carried out using a 3 -dimensional vehicle model coupled with a bridge plate model, simulating a traffic population similar to the population measured at the site. These theoretical simulations varied those properties of the 5 -axle fleet that influence the dynamic response; simulating multiple sets of total (dynamic + static) responses for a single measured static strain response. Extrapolating the results of these theoretical simulations to a 50 -year Assessment Dynamic Ratio gives similar results to those obtained by extrapolating the data measured using the Bridge <b>Weigh-in-Motion</b> system. A study of the effect of Bridge <b>Weigh-in-Motion</b> system errors on the predictions of Assessment Dynamic Ratio is conducted, identifying a trend in the Bridge <b>Weigh-in-Motion</b> calculations of maximum static response. The result of this bias is in turn quantified in the context of predicting characteristic maximum total load effect...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new level I damage {{identification}} method for short span statically indeterminate bridges using the information provided by a Bridge <b>Weigh-in-Motion</b> system. Bridge <b>Weigh-In-Motion</b> systems measure the bridge deformation due to the crossing of traffic to estimate traffic attributes, namely axle weights and distances between axles for each vehicle. It is theoretically shown that it is convenient to introduce a fictitious weightless axle, which has been termed 2 ̆ 7 Virtual Axle 2 ̆ 7, in the Bridge <b>Weigh-in-Motion</b> calculations to derive a damage indicator. The latter can be used both as a new robust output-only model-free level I structural health monitoring technique and as a new self-calibration method for Bridge <b>Weigh-In-Motion</b> systems. The response of a fixed-fixed beam traversed by a 2 -axle vehicle travelling over an irregular profile is used to validate the proposed method. By means of Monte Carlo simulation {{the influence of the}} key parameters such as the degree and location of damage, noise levels, span lengths and profile irregularities on the accuracy of the method are investigated.

40|$|Abstract- Bridge <b>Weigh-in-Motion</b> {{systems can}} be used to {{estimate}} vehicle parameters such as velocity, axle loads, or the distance between axles without affecting the traffic. These parameters and the classification of vehicles are necessary to determine vehicle overload and hence may help to reduce risks for road users and road infrastructure and allow optimized planning of maintenance work. The Bridge <b>Weigh-in-Motion</b> system developed is based on a crack displacement sensor with intelligent data processing algorithms: In a first step, the number of axles, the distance between axles, and the velocity of the vehicle is obtained from the crack displacement signal by means of wavelet decomposition. In a subsequent step, the axle loads are found by means of optimizing the weights for axle loads that the measured crack displacement signal can be approximated by a superposition of (shifted and extended/compressed) ‘Lines of Influence’. Intensive test runs have been performed to verify results of the Bridge <b>Weigh-in-Motion</b> system...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} use of archived <b>weigh-in-motion</b> (WIM) data to estimate link-based heavy-vehicle emissions for Oregon highways. This research combined data on vehicle speed, highway grade, and gross vehicle weight and relationship between these elements in published research to estimate the carbon dioxide (CO 2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from trucks. Sensitivity analysis {{was conducted on the}} impact of uphill grade and gross vehicle weight on truck speed and emissions. The results suggest that with the data available in the <b>weigh-in-motion</b> archive and with a reasonable set of assumptions, link-based emissions for heavy-duty vehicles can be estimated. The carbon dioxide (CO 2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions are found to increase when the speed, gross vehicle weight, or road grade increases. The relationship between nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions and vehicle weight was estimated to be linear.

40|$|Systems which {{permit the}} {{weighing}} of vehicles in motion are called dynamic <b>Weigh-in-Motion</b> scales. In such systems, axle load sensors {{are embedded in}} the pavement.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} use of Bayesian {{updating}} to improve estimates of characteristic bridge traffic loading. Over recent years the use <b>Weigh-In-Motion</b> technologies has increased hugely. Large <b>Weigh-In-Motion</b> databases are now available for multiple sites on many road networks. The objective of this work is to use data gathered throughout a road network to improve site-specific estimates of bridge loading at a specific <b>Weigh-In-Motion</b> site on the network. Bayesian updating is a mathematical framework for combining prior knowledge with new sample data. The approach is applied here to bridge loading using a database of 81. 6 million truck records, gathered at 19 sites in the US. The database represents the prior knowledge of loading throughout the road network and a new site on the network is simulated. The Bayesian approach is compared with a non-Bayesian approach, which uses only the site-specific data, and the results compared. It is found that the Bayesian approach significantly improves the accuracy of estimates of 75 -year loading and, in particular, considerably reduces the standard deviation of the error. With the proposed approach less site-specific WIM data is required to obtain an accurate estimate of loading. This is particularly useful where there is concern over an existing bridge and accurate estimates of loading are required {{as a matter of}} urgency...|$|E
