40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} changing energy prices on Australian ambulance systems. Methods: Generalised estimating equations were used to analyse contemporaneous and lagged relationships between changes in energy prices and ambulance system performance measures in all Australian State/Territory ambulance systems for the years 2000 – 2010. Measures included: expenditures per response; labour-to-total expenditure ratio; full-time equivalent employees (FTE) per 10, 000 responses; average salary; median and 90 th percentile response time; and injury compensation claims. Energy price data included State average diesel price, State average electricity price, and world crude oil price. Results: Changes in diesel prices were inversely associated <b>with</b> <b>changes</b> in salaries, and positively associated <b>with</b> <b>changes</b> in ambulance response times; changes in oil prices were also inversely associated <b>with</b> <b>changes</b> in salaries, as well with staffing levels and expenditures per ambulance response. Changes in electricity prices were positively associated <b>with</b> <b>changes</b> in expenditures per response and changes in salaries; they were also positively associated <b>with</b> <b>changes</b> in injury compensation claims per 100 FTE. Conclusion: Changes in energy prices are associated <b>with</b> <b>changes</b> in Australian ambulance systems' resource, performance and safety characteristics in ways that could affect both patients and personnel. Further {{research is needed to}} explore the mechanisms of, and strategies for mitigating, these impacts. The impacts of energy prices on other aspects of the health system should also be investigated...|$|R

25|$|A {{number of}} strategists use {{scenario}} planning techniques to deal <b>with</b> <b>change.</b> The way Peter Schwartz {{put it in}} 1991 is that strategic outcomes cannot be known in advance so the sources of competitive advantage cannot be predetermined. The fast changing business environment is too uncertain for us to find sustainable value in formulas of excellence or competitive advantage. Instead, scenario planning is a technique in which multiple outcomes can be developed, their implications assessed, and their likeliness of occurrence evaluated. According to Pierre Wack, scenario planning is about insight, complexity, and subtlety, not about formal analysis and numbers.|$|E

[...] The Mint began striking clad dimes and quarters, replacing the silver pieces which the public would not spend. [...] Although coinage had been stopped at San Francisco after 1955, the California facility began to issue cents again, though without mintmarks. [...] In 1968, mintmarks were restored to the cent. [...] San Francisco began minting a limited number of circulation strikes (which it would cease to do after 1974) and began striking proof coins. [...] By this time the master hub had become quite worn and Lincoln's features were becoming indistinct. [...] For the 1969 coins a new master was produced for use in all three mints and the features were sharpened and moved further from the edge of the coin, while the lettering was broadened.|$|E
