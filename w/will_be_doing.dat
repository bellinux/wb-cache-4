40|$|ABSTRACT—Recognition of {{emotions}} in facial expressions {{has become a}} famous technique in 21 st century. In this paper the facial emotion recognition <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> using the hybridization of neural network with ICA as well as genetic algorithm. Firstly the feature extraction <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> using ICA then the feature reduction <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> using genetic algorithm in which features are reduced to small dataset. Then classification of five emotions <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> like SAD, HAPPY, SURPRISE ANGRY and NEUTRAL using neural network classifiers. The whole simulation has been taken place in MATLAB environment. The result value obtained by this approach is good and efficient and requires less effort of extracting different features individually...|$|R
