60|$|The patient <b>winced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> last {{experiment}} and uttered a low cry.|$|E
60|$|I <b>winced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{thought of}} my story being ruined by a housemaid.|$|E
60|$|Anna's falseness {{would surely}} break his heart, and Alma <b>winced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{thought of his}} pain.|$|E
60|$|Now, for {{the first}} time, Harry began to <b>wince</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> words of his young lecturer.|$|R
60|$|Even then, numb as was {{her flesh}} with cold, {{he felt her}} <b>wince</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> question.|$|R
60|$|He {{paused at}} that, for {{he saw his}} father <b>wince</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> picture like a man {{physically}} struck; and again there was silence.|$|R
60|$|The {{merchant}} <b>winced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{use of a}} nickname, {{but after}} an instant's hesitation passed it over.|$|E
60|$|I <b>winced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{thought of}} my story being ruined by a housemaid. And yet nothing was more probable.|$|E
60|$|Rulledge <b>winced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> outrage, but {{he would}} not stay Halson's answer even for the sake of righting himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Uncle," [...] said she, <b>wincing</b> {{a little}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> name, {{as a horse}} with a sore back <b>winces</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> touch of the saddle, [...] "it wasn't about the sheep that I was going to speak to you. I {{want you to do}} me a favour." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Our S'r Ann, wheer's thy knittin' needles?" [...] asked <b>the</b> woman, <b>wincing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time, {{and putting}} {{her hand to}} the mouth of the sucking child. Catching my eye, she said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] said Deronda, {{with some}} {{softening}} of voice. [...] "But experience differs for different people. We don't all <b>wince</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same things. I have {{had plenty of}} proof {{that you are not}} dense." [...] He smiled at her.|$|R
60|$|She <b>winced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> insult, and {{the tears}} which she fain would have hidden from him, rose involuntarily to her eyes.|$|E
6000|$|How at Bankside, a boy {{drowning}} kittens [...] <b>Winced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> business; whereupon {{his sister}} [...] (Lady Macbeth aged seven) thrust 'em under, [...] Sombrely scornful.|$|E
6000|$|The captain rather <b>winced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sight. 'Well, well,' he said hastily, 'that's enough.... Now, at any rate, you {{understand}} my objection to know Miss Power.' ...|$|E
50|$|I'd {{spent a month}} {{preparing}} for that by starving myself. I was 8st 5lbs. When I look <b>at</b> pictures I <b>wince</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sight of the jutting collarbone. I can see I looked too thin, but <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time I was delighted by my protruding bones and concave stomach.|$|R
6000|$|Maisie {{knew all}} about bolting, but, decidedly, she WAS older, and there was {{something}} in her that could <b>wince</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> way her father made the ugly word--ugly enough at best--sound flat and low. It prompted her to amend his allusion, which she did by saying: [...] "I don't know what she'll do. But she'll be happy." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was hard}} for Barbara {{to realize that she}} had {{associated}} with a thief--just for a moment it was hard, until recollection forced upon her the unwelcome fact of the status of another whom she had known--to whom she had given her love. The girl did not <b>wince</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> thought--instead she squared her shoulders and raised her chin.|$|R
6000|$|She visibly <b>winced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> deep but {{unintended}} {{irony of}} this; but even while {{she did so}} she panted quickly: “Then in the lights on your altar—?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, it's {{so sweet}} {{and clean and}} homelike," [...] said the girl quickly. At any other time he would have <b>winced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> last adjective. It struck him now as exactly the word.|$|E
6000|$|I <b>winced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fair show of {{the scene}} in Mrs. Grose's face; she looked for a minute as if she sharply saw them together. [...] "And him who thinks so well of you!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Fleda faltered again, <b>wincing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> term of endearment, <b>at</b> what <b>the</b> words {{took for}} granted, {{charged with the}} {{confidence}} she had now committed herself to betray. [...] "I told him I would tell you!" [...] She smiled, but she felt that her smile was rather hollow and even that Mrs. Gereth had begun {{to look at her}} with some fixedness.|$|R
60|$|For Miltoun {{was not one}} {{of those}} who take things lying down; he took things desperately, deeply, and with revolt. He took them like a rider riding himself, {{plunging}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dig of his own spurs, chafing and <b>wincing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> cruel tugs of his own bitt; bearing in his friendless, proud heart all the burden of struggles which shallower or more genial natures shared with others.|$|R
5000|$|Commemorating the book's fiftieth {{anniversary in}} 2010, Frank Keating of The Guardian wrote that [...] "This Sporting Life has {{stood the test}} of 'classic' {{category}} ... The novel's uneasy love story of insecure anti-hero tough, Machin, and his world-weary landlady, Mrs Howard, earthily provides harrowing off-field narrative, but it is in the raw sporting passages where <b>the</b> reader can <b>wince</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> resonance of uncomfortable truths." ...|$|R
6000|$|Porportuk <b>winced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{laughter}} {{that went}} down the table. His eyes burned malevolently. “We were boys together, of the same age,” he said. “In your throat is death. I am still alive and strong.” ...|$|E
6000|$|He <b>winced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{mention of}} his grandfather. He had hateful {{memories}} of him. [...] "That does not matter," [...] he answered. [...] "I simply {{want to see the}} place--that is all. Give me the key." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What a beard you've got, Uncle Foster!" [...] were Randy's first words, as he <b>winced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> close grip Foster Portney {{gave his}} hand. [...] "You look {{like all the}} rest of the Westerners around here!" ...|$|E
60|$|Soames {{watched his}} {{daughter}} give her hand, saw her <b>wince</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> squeeze it received, and distinctly heard the young man's sigh {{as he passed}} out. Then she came from the window, trailing her finger along the mahogany edge of the billiard-table. Watching her, Soames {{knew that she was}} going to ask him something. Her finger felt round the last pocket, and she looked up.|$|R
5000|$|Birch {{claims that}} teenage {{children}} would <b>wince</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> kind of confession Paula {{is about to}} make: [...] "It's toe-curling, too, when she regales them with how wonderful sex is for her and their dad. 'I have to confess it, a great lust for your father, for your father's body,' for this man with whom 'I made the tenderest of sweetest love just two hours ago.' Believe me, Paula, your 16-year-olds don't wish to know this." ...|$|R
6000|$|I am the hounded slave, I <b>wince</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{bite of the}} dogs, [...] Hell {{and despair}} are upon me, crack and again crack the marksmen, [...] I clutch the rails of the fence, my gore dribs, thinn'd with the [...] ooze of my skin, [...] I fall on the weeds and stones, [...] The riders spur their unwilling horses, haul close, [...] Taunt my dizzy ears and beat me violently {{over the head with}} whip-stocks.|$|R
6000|$|... "You must {{understand}} me very little, Mrs. Quest" [...] (it {{had always been}} Belle before, and she <b>winced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> changed name), [...] "if you think me capable of such conduct. You {{have nothing to fear}} from me." ...|$|E
6000|$|I <b>winced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> question. [...] "Your papa {{has gone}} on a journey, dear," [...] I said, [...] "and left me to look after you. We shall find him one day. You don't mind going with Heer Allan, do you?" ...|$|E
60|$|One {{glance at}} the man's face was enough to prove his sincerity. The great stern Anabaptist, who had not <b>winced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> news of his mother's death, dropt right on his knees on the floor, and burst into violent sobs.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Huh! she's adopted you,' Seth grins. And {{it looked}} like it. She just stood there and looked at me--at us--like a loving hound dog that you love, that you've caught {{with a string of}} {{sausages}} inside of him, and that just knows you ain't going to lift a hand to him. 'Go chase yourself!' I told her pronto." [...] (Mrs. Jones her proximity noticeable with a <b>wince</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Spanish word.) [...] "You see, Sarah, I'd no use for her, even <b>at</b> <b>the</b> start." ...|$|R
60|$|Philammon <b>winced</b> {{somewhat}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> hint; {{which seemed}} to have an ugly verisimilitude in it: but still, philosophy he must learn, and bread he must eat; so he submitted.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{does seem}} clear," [...] said the bishop, who had <b>winced</b> visibly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> words {{servants}} and stipend, which, however, {{appeared to have}} caused no uneasiness to the archdeacon.|$|R
