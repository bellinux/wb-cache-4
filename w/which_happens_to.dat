Studying Porites coral provides a stable foundation for geochemical interpretations that is much simpler to physically extract data in comparison to Platygyra species where the complexity of Platygyra species skeletal structure creates difficulty when physically sampled, <b>which</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> be one of the only multidecadal living coral records used for coral paleoclimate modeling.|$|E
5|$|One aetosaur, Typothorax coccinarum, {{has been}} used to define the Revueltian land {{vertebrate}} faunachron. A land vertebrate faunachron (LVF) is a time interval that is defined by the first appearance datum (FAD), or first occurrence, of a tetrapod index fossil and is commonly used to date Late Triassic and Early Jurassic terrestrial strata. Since the FAD of T. coccinarum is {{at the beginning of the}} Norian stage, the Revueltian LVF starts at the beginning of the Norian around 216 million years ago. The Revueltian ends with the next FAD, <b>which</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> be that of the phytosaur Redondasaurus and the start of the Apachean LVF.|$|E

His helper robot Rock, having a strong sense of justice, offers to be converted into a fighting robot to stop Dr. Wily's plan, becoming Mega Man. In time, he defeats the six robots and recovers their central cores, then confronts Dr. Wily within his Pacific-based robot factory (<b>which</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> be mass-producing Light's robots). After a final showdown, Wily is defeated and Mega Man returns to his family.|$|E

25|$|Sorting is {{typically}} done in-place, by iterating up the array, growing the sorted list behind it. At each array-position, it checks the value there against the largest {{value in the}} sorted list (<b>which</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> be next to it, in the previous array-position checked). If larger, it leaves the element in place {{and moves to the}} next. If smaller, it finds the correct position within the sorted list, shifts all the larger values up to make a space, and inserts into that correct position.|$|E
25|$|The past participle of {{the weak}} verbs has the ending -et or -t. The past participle of the strong verbs {{originally}} had the ending -en, neuter -et, but the common form is now restricted to the use as an adjective (e.g. en bunden opgave), {{and it has not}} been preserved in all verbs. When it is combined with er and har to form passive and perfect constructions, the neuter form, <b>which</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> be identical to the ending {{of the weak}} verbs, is used. In the Jutlandic dialects, -en is frequently used in such constructions.|$|E

The Sarimanok ID became utmostly associated with the channel that ABS-CBN opted it to become the station's mascot.

25|$|Lamarck {{is usually}} remembered for {{his belief in}} the {{inheritance}} of acquired characteristics, and the use and disuse model by which organisms developed their characteristics. Lamarck incorporated this belief into his theory of evolution, along with other more common beliefs of the time, such as spontaneous generation. The inheritance of acquired characteristics (also called the theory of adaptation or soft inheritance) was rejected by August Weismann in the 1880s when he developed a theory of inheritance in which germ plasm (the sex cells, later redefined as DNA), remained separate and distinct from the soma (the rest of the body); thus nothing <b>which</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> the soma may be passed on with the germ-plasm. This model underlies the modern understanding of inheritance.|$|E
25|$|Using {{techniques}} of seismic sequence stratigraphy the English Permo-Triassic megasequence {{can be divided}} into three sequences bounded at the top and base by local or regional unconformities. Construction of a seismic sequence stratigraphy allows the examination of the interaction of tectonics and sedimentation. On this basis the Cheshire Basin can be divided roughly into two areas - a westerly area close to the western basin margin and an easterly area nearer to the Carboniferous WEM / Red Rock Fault. The Red Rock fault - really a group of faults, is the name given locally to one <b>which</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> throw Carboniferous and Permo-Triassic rocks together. It runs north - south a trend followed by the Kirkleyditch and the Alderley faults.. Seismic interpretation shows that deposition in the western area was essentially post-rift - resulting in packages of parallel reflectors on seismic data.|$|E
