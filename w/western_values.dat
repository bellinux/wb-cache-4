The MDC was also negatively impacted by its time in coalition government, with perceptions that it had been just as corrupt as ZANU-PF.

40|$|Abstract. With {{penetration}} {{and influence}} of <b>western</b> mainstream <b>value,</b> Chinese socialist value outlook is promoted to make some changes, so as to adapt to social development needs. At the same time, we should guarantee advancement of socialist ideology, {{so as to guarantee}} stable and healthy socialist development. While accepting <b>western</b> mainstream <b>value,</b> we should convert its superior parts, so as to promote continuous improvement to Chinese socialist <b>value</b> outlook. Facing <b>western</b> mainstream <b>value,</b> we should show respect, seek common points while reserving difference, and allow our socialist value outlook standing in the forest of world ideology. Thus, we can clearly see advantages and disadvantages of our cultural values, so as to promote development of our socialist culture and give correct guidance. International social competition becomes more and more fierce. National cultural soft power is an important pattern of manifestation for comprehensive national strength. At the same time, we should also pay attention to differences between socialist <b>value</b> outlook and <b>western</b> mainstream <b>value.</b> This is an essential link for promotion of exchange and cooperation between different countries. Preface Formation and development of socialist value outlook is resulted from continuous exploration an...|$|R

30|$|We first {{introduce}} the main findings and hypotheses of <b>Western</b> <b>value</b> change research.

Based on this, we deduce hypotheses for East Asia, shedding light on the region’s shared cultural background (Confucianism) and the related value system; here, we limit our analysis to Japan, China, and South Korea. Next, we empirically test our hypotheses concerning value change, based on the WVSs. Besides structural settings and the cultural-ethical background, we acknowledge different paths to modernity, as suggested by S.N. Eisenstadt (2000).|$|R

The connections with the traditional aristocratic families did not manage to stop these people from having strong beliefs in nationalism.

25|$|Free {{movement}} of people across the EU will give many Turkish people the opportunity to easily migrate {{to other parts of}} Europe in search of work, or a higher standard of living.

Conversely, some non-secularists in Turkey envisage that accession will contribute to the further growth and acceptance of Islam in Europe.

In a survey carried out under guidance of Okakura Kakuzō and Ernest Fenollosa from 1888 to 1897 all over Japan, about 210,000 objects of artistic or historic merit were evaluated and catalogued. The end of the 19th century saw a drastic change in political climate and cultural values: from an enthusiastic adoption of <b>western</b> <b>values</b> to a returned interest in the Japanese cultural heritage. Japanese architectural history appeared on curricula and the first books on architectural history were published, stimulated by the newly compiled inventories.|$|E

25|$|Many {{academics}} {{argue that}} peacebuilding is {{a manifestation of}} liberal internationalism and therefore imposes <b>Western</b> <b>values</b> and practices onto other cultures. Mac Ginty states that although peacebuilding does not project all aspects of Western culture on to the recipient states, it does transmit some of them, including concepts like neoliberalism that the West requires recipients of aid to follow more closely than most Western countries do. Barnett also comments that the promotion of liberalization and democratization may undermine the peacebuilding process if security and stable institutions are not pursued concurrently. Richmond has shown how 'liberal peacebuilding' represents a political encounter that may produce a post-liberal form of peace.

25|$|The textbook's {{political}} ideas became historiographic theses and quickly turned into requirements {{for all the}} official history writing of the period. Class struggle was presented as {{the driving force of}} history, with social conflicts taken out of context and exaggerated in importance. A special case is the ancient history chapter, on Roman Dacia. There, commentators note, Roller veers into pseudohistory, creating a narrative about social revolts among the Dacians, none of which actually occurred. Historic figures were relegated to the exploitative classes, the suppression of these classes by the dictatorship of the proletariat being justified by their centuries of misdeeds. The Soviet Union was lavished with praise, the contributions of Slavs in Romanian history being highlighted, from the migratory period to the medieval period, to the War of Independence and the present. The very origin of the Romanians was narrated differently than before: Roller himself concluded that the influence of Slavic polities—Danube Bulgaria, Kievan Rus', Halych—was fundamental in shaping the lives of early Romanians. Classical <b>Western</b> <b>values</b> were attacked, more violently in later editions as the Cold War deepened.|$|E
25|$|In {{particular}} {{during the}} 1960s and 1970s many gurus acquired groups of young followers in Western Europe and the USA. According to the American sociologist David G. Bromley this was partially {{due to the}} repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1965 which permitted Asian gurus entrance to the USA. According to the Dutch Indologist Albertina Nugteren, the repeal was only one of several factors and a minor one compared with the two most important causes for the surge of all things 'Eastern': the post-war cross-cultural mobility and the general dissatisfaction with established <b>Western</b> <b>values.</b> According to the professor in sociology Stephen A. Kent at the University of Alberta and Kranenborg (1974), {{one of the reasons why}} in the 1970s young people including hippies turned to gurus was because they found that drugs had opened for them the existence of the transcendental or because they wanted to get high without drugs. According to Kent, another reason why this happened so often in the USA then, was because some anti-Vietnam War protesters and political activists became worn out or disillusioned of the possibilities to change society through political means, and as an alternative turned to religious means. Some gurus and the groups they lead attracted opposition. One example of such group was the Hare Krishna movement (ISKCON) founded by A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada in 1966, many of whose followers voluntarily accepted the demandingly ascetic lifestyle of bhakti yoga on a full-time basis, in stark contrast to much of the popular culture of the time.|$|E

40|$|The present {{research}} investigated how host and foreign cultures impacted on multiply enculturated individuals, specifically {{on how they}} integrate values from foreign cultures. We argued that whether foreign values are integrated into an individual's host cultural meaning system depends on the compatibility of the values with implicit beliefs in the host culture. Hence some parts of a foreign culture {{are more likely to}} be embraced than others. Specifically with regard to Western achievement versus moral values, we contend that because <b>Western</b> achievement <b>values</b> are relatively more compatible with implicit beliefs in Hong Kong society, they are more cognitively accessible than <b>Western</b> moral <b>values.</b> We investigated the cognitive accessibility of cultural values to contemporary Hong Kong students by measuring the associations triggered by role models. Study 1 found that Chinese moral values were relatively more accessible than other values when Chinese role models were presented whereas competence values were more accessible than other <b>values</b> when <b>Western</b> role models were presented. In studies 2 to 5, participants generated examples of role models; the Chinese role models generated tended to exemplify Chinese moral <b>values</b> best whereas <b>Western</b> role model generated tended to exemplify <b>Western</b> competence <b>values</b> better than <b>Western</b> moral <b>values.</b> This implied that impact of Chinese culture on contemporary Hong Kong students occurs mainly in moral domain, whereas that of Western culture was mainly in competence domain. Implication for the dynamic use of values from different cultures by bicultural individuals is discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presented}} {{the result of}} a comparative research on the Top-ten International News Reports voted in China and the United States between 2006 and 2010. The research was aimed at exploring the convergences and divergences of Chinese and <b>Western</b> news <b>value</b> perceptions. It is primarily concerned with two questions: What are the factors determining news worthiness in China and the United States? What are the similarities and differences between Chinese and Western journalism theories and practices? Chinese and <b>Western</b> news <b>value</b> theories were reviewed to establish the theoretical framework for content analysis and discussion of the analysis result. The research found that despite ideological and cultural distinctions, there were considerable similarities between Chinese and <b>Western</b> news <b>value</b> theories. However, significant disparities were found in practices of news selection and construction in China and the United States. The research results demonstrated the dual aspects of the globalising media system: the increasing interconnection and homogenisation between national media systems, and the reinforced segmentation and localities of the world information communication. 10 page(s...|$|R
