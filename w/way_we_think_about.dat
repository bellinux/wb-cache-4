500|$|To Kill a Mockingbird {{has been}} a source of {{significant}} controversy since its being the subject of classroom study as early as 1963. The book's racial slurs, profanity, and frank discussion of rape have led people to challenge its appropriateness in libraries and classrooms across the United States. The American Library Association reported that To Kill a Mockingbird was number 21 of the 100 most frequently challenged books of 2000–2009. Following parental complaints about the racist language it contains, the novel was removed from classrooms in Virginia in 2016 and Biloxi in 2017, where it was described as making people [...] "uncomfortable." [...] In the Mississippi case, the novel was removed from the required reading list but subsequently made available to interested students with parental consent. Such decisions have been criticised: the American Civil Liberties Union noted the importance of engaging with the novel's themes in places where racial injustice persists. Becky Little of The History Channel and representatives of the Mark Twain House pointed out the value of classics lies in their power to [...] "challenge the <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> things" [...] (Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn has attracted similar controversy). Arne Duncan, who served as Secretary of Education under President Obama, noted that removal of the book from reading lists was evidence of a nation with [...] "real problems." [...] In 1966, a parent in Hanover, Virginia protested that the use of rape as a plot device was immoral. Johnson cites examples of letters to local newspapers, which ranged from amusement to fury; those letters expressing the most outrage, however, complained about Mayella Ewell's attraction to Tom Robinson over the depictions of rape. Upon learning the school administrators were holding hearings to decide the book's appropriateness for the classroom, Harper Lee sent $10 to The Richmond News Leader suggesting it to be used toward the enrollment of [...] "the Hanover County School Board in any first grade of its choice". The National Education Association in 1968 placed the novel second on a list of books receiving the most complaints from private organizations—after Little Black Sambo.|$|E

According to Harris, science [...] "reveals {{you to be a}} biochemical puppet." [...] People's thoughts and intentions, Harris says, [...] "emerge from background causes of which we are unaware and over which we exert no conscious control." [...] Every choice we make is made as a result of preceding causes. These choices we make are determined by those causes, and are therefore not really choices at all. Harris also draws a distinction between conscious and unconscious reactions to the world. Harris argues that this realization about the human mind does not undermine morality or diminish the importance of social and political freedom, but it can and should change the <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> {{some of the most important}} questions in life.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike the {{founding}} farther of criminology, Cesare Lombroso, {{who thought that}} crime was fundamentally biological in its origin and criminals lacked free will altogether, contemporary neurocriminologists seem to take the middle ground approach. They do not argue that biological factors alone cause behavioral problems, but recognize that behavior results from interaction between biology and environment. Some authors, however, are more determinist in their views. As one author writes: [...] "Free will may exist (it may simply be beyond our current science), but one thing seems clear: if free will does exist, it has little room in which to operate. It can at best be a small factor riding on top of vast neural networks shaped by genes and environment. In fact, free will may end up being so small that we eventually think about bad decision-making in the same <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> any physical process, such as diabetes or lung disease." ...|$|E
2500|$|His Theology in the Flesh: How Embodiment and Culture Shape the <b>Way</b> <b>We</b> <b>Think</b> <b>about</b> Truth, Morality, and God is {{the first}} book to apply the field of {{cognitive}} linguistics to theology. According to cognitive linguistics, the specific types of bodies humans have shape how we interact with and understand our world. We have concepts such as up/down and in/out because we have bodies that can experience these sorts of things. Embodied experience also gives rise much of our metaphorical thinking. For instance, {{we know what it}} is like to go on a journey in which we experience getting to a destination together and perhaps overcoming obstacles on the way. Many, but not all, languages use the experience physical journeys as the framework in which to understand the experience of love. We say, [...] "Our relationship has come a long way together" [...] and [...] "We have overcome many bumps in the road." [...] We reason about our love relationship in terms of a journey. Yet, in English, we also conceive of love in terms of strong physical forces ("He's blown away by love"), magnetism ("She is attracted to him"), and even insanity ("He is crazy about her"). That means that metaphors can be cognitive and not merely rhetorical. We actually think with metaphors.|$|E
2500|$|... "Researchers at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a Department of Energy lab in Tennessee, have {{discovered}} a mechanism for converting carbon dioxide into ethanol. Their method takes advantage of nanotechnology, creating a catalyst that produces ethanol from a solution of carbon dioxide in water. 'We discovered somewhat by accident that this material worked,' said Adam Rondinone, the lead {{author of a new}} study in the journal ChemistrySelect. 'We were trying to study the first step of a proposed reaction when we realized that the catalyst was doing the entire reaction on its own.' The discovery may change the <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> carbon dioxide. If it could be captured and turned into a fuel, then carbon dioxide – the earth-polluting byproduct of global dependence on fossil fuels – could help high-energy societies work toward energy independence. Repurposing carbon dioxide could be invaluable for the environment, the researchers say. Converting it into ethanol can turn a greenhouse gas into a gasoline-like fuel source. Ethanol contains one-third less energy than gasoline but produces far fewer byproducts when burned in engines, which can limit further carbon emissions. 'Closing the carbon cycle by utilizing CO2 as a feedstock for currently used commodities, in order to displace a fossil feedstock, is an appropriate intermediate step towards a carbon-free future,” the researchers wrote in the study." ...|$|E

However, beyond the general imperative to participate, major policy bodies offer little guidance on what this entails. We suggest that the dominance of Arnstein's ladder of citizen participation in policy discourses constrains the <b>ways</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>about,</b> and critically the purposes we ascribe to, participation in a climate change context. We suggest an alternative framing of climate change, where no single group has clear access to understanding the issue and its resolution. Thus adaptation is fundamentally dependent on new forms of learning. Drawing on experiences of social learning approaches to natural resource managing, we explore how a commitment to social learning more accurately embodies the new kinds of role, relationship, practice and sense of purpose required to progress adaptive climate change agendas and practices...|$|R

I asked {{in the early days of}} the 21 stC why terms like “performance mastery”, “virtuosity” and “disciplinary expertise” figured so rarely in performance and dance studies writing, even though each of these plays its role in judgements made every day in the working environments as well as the performance spaces of dance/performance. Today I want to talk about the vital role of intuitive process in creative decision-making in performance, a role that tends to increase (rather than diminish) as the practitioner’s own expertise increases. Intuitive process, from this perspective, is a vital knowledge practice (epistemics) in art-making, rather than the poor and frivolous cousin of rational and analytic thought...|$|R
40|$|Sociological {{research}} has hitherto largely focused on majority and minority ethnic identities or citizenship identities. However, the social connections between youth {{are not simply}} ethnic dynamics but also political dynamics involving citizenship categories. This article argues that in postmodern societies, {{it is important to}} reconsider the <b>ways</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> youth identities. Drawing upon qualitative data from a study into the political identities of majority (German and British) youth and Turkish youth, educated in two Stuttgart and two London secondary schools, the research found that fifteen-year-olds had no singular identity but hybrid ethnonational, ethno-local and national-European identities as a result of governmental policies, their schooling and community experience, social class positioning, ethnicity and migration history. In working-class educational contexts,many majority and Turkish youth privileged the ethnic dimension of hybridity whereas majority and Turkish youth in the two middle-class dominated schools emphasized the political dimension of hybridity. The article demonstrates that social class and schooling (e. g. ethos and peer cultures) have a considerable role to play in who can afford to take on the more hybridized cosmopolitan identities on offer...|$|R
