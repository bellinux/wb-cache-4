25|$|On 23 October 2016, while Mourinho's Manchester United was {{trailing}} 4–0 against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea manager Antonio Conte waved up {{the home}} crowd, {{urging them to}} make more noise to support the team. At {{the end of the}} match, Mourinho shook Conte's hand and <b>whispered</b> <b>into</b> his ear, with media reports claiming Mourinho had accused Conte of trying to humiliate United with his actions. Both managers refused to confirm or deny the report, but Conte refuted claims {{that he was trying to}} antagonise Mourinho. Chelsea midfielder Pedro supported Conte, claiming Mourinho's reaction was out of context.|$|E

It is outrageous." [...] Duchess Sophie then <b>whispered</b> <b>into</b> Franz Ferdinand's ear, and after a pause, Franz Ferdinand said to the mayor: [...] "Now you may speak." [...] He then became calm and the mayor gave his speech. Franz Ferdinand had to wait as his own speech, still wet with blood from being in the damaged car, was brought to him. To the prepared text he added a few remarks about the day's events thanking the people of Sarajevo for their ovations [...] "as I see in them an expression of their joy at {{the failure of the}} attempt at assassination." ...|$|E
2500|$|Muslims {{expect that}} their {{last word in}} this world would be their {{profession}} of faith (which reads [...] "I testify {{that there is no}} God but Allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah"). That's why, those near a dying person encourage him to pronounce these words. Sometimes, it is <b>whispered</b> <b>into</b> the ear of the dying. Basically death is nothing to fear in Islam and accepted as wholly natural. It merely marks a transition between the material realm and the unseen world.|$|E

2500|$|In this connection, {{another thing}} {{also should be}} kept in mind: evil {{suggestion}} is not <b>whispered</b> <b>into</b> the heart of man only from outside by the satans from among men and jinn, but also by the self of man from within. His own wrong theories misguide his intellect, his own unlawful motives and desires lead his power of discrimination, will and power of judgment astray, and {{it is not only the}} satans from outside but within his satan of the self also beguiles him. This has been expressed in the Quran: [...] "and We know the evil suggestions arising from his self." [...] (Qaf : 16). On this very basis, Muhammad said: [...] "We seek Allah's refuge from the evils of our self." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 28 October, after {{performing}} on V Graham Norton {{to promote the}} Singles compilation, Anderson {{made the decision to}} call it a day. This decision coincided with the release of the band's biography, Love and Poison on 3 November. On 5 November, the band announced {{that there would be no}} more projects under the Suede name for the foreseeable future – effectively announcing the end of the band, as they stated on their website: [...] "There will not be a new studio album until the band feel that the moment is artistically right to make one." [...] Anderson also made a personal statement saying: [...] "There has been speculation about record sales and chart positions, but the bottom line is I need to do whatever it takes to get my demon back." [...] Suede's last concert at the London Astoria on 13 December 2003 was a two-and-a-half-hour marathon show, split into two parts plus encore. Anderson made an announcement, saying, [...] "I just want you to know. There will be another Suede record. But not yet." [...] Later, Osman would reveal that as they were walking to the studio set, Anderson <b>whispered</b> <b>into</b> his ear: [...] "Let's not do this anymore." ...|$|E
