Selena sings to her absent lover about how much she misses him, saying that he is [...] "always on [...] mind" [...] and that she feels lonely {{when he is not}} with her. Three times she sings, [...] "I often think of the happy times we spent together / And I just can't <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you that I love you". In the chorus, she sings of wanting to hold him tight and feel his heartbeat.|$|E
500|$|The episode also {{explores the}} idea that Reyes made a deal that {{involved}} becoming the Ghost Rider, {{and now he has}} [...] "this thing in" [...] him that wants to murder people which Reyes is [...] "ambivalent" [...] about. Bell said that this is the main aspect of their version that grounds him in [...] "a sadness ... and a weight", particularly when interacting with his brother Gabe. In terms of the season's overarching plot, Bell said it was important to tell Reyes' origin story in the episode, rather than earlier or later, because it also reveals the [...] "truth about Eli, and they're very connected." [...] He also drew comparison to the Marvel Netflix television series which often <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the origin story of their heroes later in the season, using flashbacks, saying, [...] "It kind of helps {{to know more about the}} character, and be emotionally invested in the character, before you then go back and show what turned them into this person. And so part of it was that if you just began with a guy and showed the origin right away, I don't know if it would have been as compelling, I don't know if it would have been as emotional as I think it is. Bell noted that the series always shows Reyes' transformations into Ghost Rider as painful, but when that is shown happening for the first time in this episode [...] "he screams in pain like a lunatic".|$|E

6000|$|... "Of course he'll keep you," [...] said Eda, warmly. [...] "If that isn't {{just like}} you, not {{saying a word}} about it. Gee, if I'd had a raise like that I just couldn't <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you. But then, I'm not smart like you." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{all this}} time George {{was still in the}} carriage, {{and as soon as the}} boys {{realized}} this, they began to make arrangements for helping him out, content to <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the good news more fully after he should be in his room once more.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Wyvil thereupon {{advised her}} not to express any opinion, until {{she was in a}} better {{position}} to judge for herself.

6000|$|Then {{suddenly}} she {{would become a}} goddess. She would turn upon me frankly and nobly, with shining eyes, with arms held out. [...] "No," [...] she would say, [...] "we love one another.

6000|$|Arthur {{had written}} {{once or twice}} during the month; but in none of his letters was there any mention of Lady Muriel. Still, I did not augur ill from his silence: to me {{it looked like the}} natural action of a lover, who, even while his heart was singing [...] "She is mine!", would fear to paint his {{happiness}} in the cold phrases of a written letter, but would <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> it by word of mouth. [...] "Yes," [...] I thought, [...] "I am to hear his song of triumph from his own lips!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Reminding {{her that}} she had herself {{proposed}} writing to me when we met that evening, I suggested that she should <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the sad story of her troubles until it was convenient to her to send me the narrative {{in the form of a}} letter. [...] "In the mean time," [...] I added, [...] "I have the most perfect confidence in you; and I beg as a favor that you will let me put it to the proof. I can introduce you to a dressmaker in London who is at the head of a large establishment, and I will do it before I leave you to-night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After his evidence, the {{sensation}} of the day occurred. A tall, dark-haired man, with the word 'City' written metaphorically all over him, had kissed the book, and was <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the truth, {{and nothing but the}} truth.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come and see, then," [...] said Meta. [...] "Flora told me {{to bring}} you home--and it is my birthday, you know. Never mind <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Ethel. Margaret will {{let her know that}} I'll keep you out of mischief." ...|$|R
6000|$|HIGGINS. Pickering: this chap has {{a certain}} natural gift of rhetoric. Observe the rhythm of his native woodnotes wild. [...] "I'm willing <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you: I'm wanting <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you: I'm <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you." [...] Sentimental rhetoric! That's the Welsh strain in him.

6000|$|But of these, {{and of his}} charities, we {{will not}} here speak, nor even of his {{influence}} for good on the King and Queen themselves. The whole tenor of his life was 'golden' in one sense, and if we told all his golden deeds they would fill an entire book. So we will only <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> how he showed his remembrance {{of what he had}} gone through in his African captivity. The redemption of the prisoners there might have seemed his first thought, but that he did so much in other quarters. At different times, with the alms that he collected, and out of the revenues of his benefices, he ransomed no less then twelve hundred slaves from their captivity. At one time the French Consul at Tunis wrote to him that for a certain sum a large number might be set free, and he raised enough to release not only these, but seventy more, and he further wrought upon the King to obtain the consent of the Dey of Tunis that a party of Christian clergy should be permitted to reside in the consul's house, and to minister to the souls and bodies of the Christian slaves, of whom there were six thousand in Tunis alone, besides those in Algiers, Tangier, and Tripoli! ...|$|E
6000|$|Let me beg {{you first}} of all not to be disconcerted by this chill legibility. I want to write to you to-day, immediately, your {{delightful}} letter of Dec. 29th having arrived this morning, and I can only manage it by dictation as I am, in consequence of some obscure indiscretion of diet yesterday, temporarily sick, sorry, and seedy; so that I can only loll, rather listless (but already better of my poison), in an armchair. My feelings don't permit me to <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you that the communication I have just had from you surpasses for pure unadulterated charm any communication I have ever received. I am really quite overcome and weakened by your recital of the generous way in which you threw yourself into {{the scale of the}} arrangement, touching my so long unserialized serial, which is manifestly so excellent a thing for me. I had begun to despair of anything, when, abruptly, this brightens the view. For I like, extremely, the place the N.A.R. makes for my novel; it meets quite my ideal in respect to that isolation and relief one has always fondly conceived as the proper due of one's productions, and yet never, amid the promiscuous petticoats and other low company of the usual magazine table-of-contents, seen them in the remotest degree attended with. One had dreamed, in private fatuity, that one would really be the better for [...] "standing out" [...] a little; but one had, to one's own sense, never really [...] "stood" [...] at all, but simply lain very flat, for the petticoats and all the foolish feet aforesaid to trample over with the best conscience in the world. Charming to me also is the idea of your own beneficent paper in the same quarter--the complete detachment of which, however, from the current fiction itself I equally apprehend and applaud: just as I see how the (not-to-be-qualified) editorial mind would indulge one of its most characteristic impulses by suggesting a connection. Never mind suggestions--and how you echo one of the most sacred laws of my own effort toward wisdom in not caring to know the source of that one! I care to know nothing but that your relation to my stuff, as it stands, gives me clear joy. Within a couple of days, moreover, your three glorious volumes of illustrated prose have arrived to enrich my existence, adorn my house and inflame my expectations. With many things pressing upon me at this moment as preliminary to winding-up here and betaking myself, till early in the summer, to London, my more penetrative attention has not yet been free for them; but I am gathering for the swoop. Please meanwhile be tenderly thanked for the massive and magnificent character of the gift. What a glorious quantity of work it brings home to me that you do! I feel like a hurdy-gurdy man listening outside a cathedral to the volume of sound poured forth there by the enthroned organist.... But good-night, my dear Howells, with every feebly-breathed, but forcibly-felt good wish of yours always and ever, ...|$|E
