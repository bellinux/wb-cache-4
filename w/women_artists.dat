5|$|In 1939 {{the museum}} began hosting the annual {{exhibitions}} of American Abstract Artists, a group devoted to expanding appreciation of non-objective art {{that had been}} formed in 1936. The show included more than 300 oils, watercolors, pastels, collages, drawings, constructions, and sculpture. That year it also began hosting exhibitions held by the New York Society of <b>Women</b> <b>Artists,</b> a group that had been founded in 1926 to promote the work of avant garde <b>women</b> <b>artists.</b> Other 1939 shows included contemporary works by artists from Poland, documentary photographs of child laborers by Lewis Hine, an international exhibition of works by <b>women</b> <b>artists,</b> and a large display of Pan-American art. Over {{the next few decades}} the museum would specialize in exhibitions by members of artists' groups. In addition to the two already named, these included the Silvermine Guild of Artists (a Connecticut summer art colony), the Manhattan Camera Club, the Photo-Engravers' Art Society, the Brooklyn Society of Artists, the Artists Equity Group, and USCO (a collective from the Woodstock, New York art colony and Garnerville, New York). The museum was organized as a unit of the Master Institute of United Arts. As it had previously done, the institute gave art classes, provided studio space, and sponsored lectures, concerts, poetry readings, art clinics, and other cultural events.|$|E

Nevertheless, the secondary market for Rae's works has been relatively strong, with one work selling in 2012 for 10,000 Euros, as against a pre-auction estimate of two-thirds that sum. Works by Rae are held in the collections of the National Gallery of Australia, National Gallery of Victoria, and the Australian War Memorial. Outside Australia, her work is represented in the Musée du Touquet, just outside Étaples township.|$|E

5|$|Louise had artistic {{training}} from childhood, {{first with}} Susan Durant from 1864, then Mary Thornycroft from 1867, and further lessons with Edgar Boehm. She also then attended National Art Training School, or NATS, which {{marks the first}} time a member of the British royal family attended a public education institution. Like many <b>women</b> <b>artists</b> in the nineteenth century, Louise had to make do with training intended for industrial designers and art teachers rather than fine artists. There was no training from the nude model, as there was for male art students.|$|E
5|$|While Lazzell is most {{well known}} for her white-line woodcuts, she also created ceramics, hooked rugs, paintings, and gouache studies. The {{subjects}} of her paintings and prints included landscape scenery and harbor scenes in Provincetown as well as flowers and still lifes. These and her abstract works incorporated elements of both Synthetic and Analytic cubism and frequently comprised arrangements of vibrantly colored geometric shapes. She was among the earliest <b>women</b> <b>artists</b> in the United States {{to work in a}} modernist style.|$|E
5|$|At the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam Knight won the Silver Medal in Painting {{with the}} {{painting}} Boxer (1917), {{one of the}} series she had painted at Witley in 1916. In 1929 Knight was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, and in June 1931 she received an honorary degree from St. Andrews University. Knight {{was elected president of}} the Society of <b>Women</b> <b>Artists</b> in 1932 and held the post until 1967. In 1936 she became the first woman since 1769 elected to full membership of the Royal Academy. The same year Knight published her first autobiography, Oil Paint and Grease Paint, which became a best-seller, with four hardback editions followed in 1941 by a Penguin paperback printing.|$|E

5|$|Her husband's {{early death}} in 1962 forced Stokes {{to return to}} {{painting}} as a career, resulting in a successful one-woman show in 1964, her first in thirty years. She continued to paint and exhibit through the 1970s and 1980s, and {{was the subject of}} a retrospective exhibition that toured Victorian regional galleries including Swan Hill Regional Art Gallery and Geelong Art Gallery in 1985. She died in 1991 and is little-known in comparison to some other <b>women</b> <b>artists</b> including Grace Cossington Smith and Clarice Beckett, but her fortunes were revived somewhat as a central figure in Anne Summers' 2009 book The Lost Mother. Her art is represented in most major Australian galleries, including the National Gallery of Australia and the National Gallery of Victoria; the Art Gallery of New South Wales is the only significant Australian collecting institution not to hold one of her works.|$|E
