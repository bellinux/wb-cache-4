5|$|Hall, who had {{converted}} to the Roman Catholic Church in 1912, was devoutly religious. She {{was also a}} believer in communication with the dead who had once hoped to become a medium– a fact that brought her into conflict with the church, which condemned spiritualism. Both these beliefs {{made their way into}} The <b>Well</b> <b>of</b> Loneliness.|$|E
5|$|In {{her later}} life {{she was in}} a {{relationship}} with the Australian author I. A. R. Wylie; the two of them supported Radclyffe Hall during the obscenity trial of Hall's book, The <b>Well</b> <b>of</b> Loneliness.|$|E

5|$|The pair {{travels to}} Cairo, where they {{meet up with}} Indy's friend Sallah, a skilled excavator. Sallah informs them that Belloq and the Nazis are digging for the <b>Well</b> <b>of</b> Souls with {{a replica of the}} {{headpiece}} (created from the scar on Toht's hand). They quickly realize the Nazi headpiece is incomplete and that the Nazis are digging in the wrong place. The Nazis kidnap Marion and it appears to Jones that she is killed in an exploding truck. After a confrontation with Belloq in a local bar, Indy and Sallah infiltrate the Nazi dig site and use their staff to correctly locate the Ark. Indy discovers Marion is alive, bound and gagged in a tent, but does not release her for fear of alerting the Nazis. Indy, Sallah, and a small group of diggers unearth the <b>Well</b> <b>of</b> Souls and acquire the Ark. Belloq and Nazi officer Colonel Dietrich arrive, seize the Ark from Jones, throwing Marion into the <b>Well</b> <b>of</b> Souls with him before sealing it back up. Jones and Marion escape to a local airstrip, where Jones has a fistfight with a Nazi mechanic and destroys the flying wing that was to transport the Ark to Berlin. The panicked Nazis remove the Ark in a truck and set off for Cairo, but Jones catches them and retakes it. He makes arrangements to take the Ark to London aboard a tramp steamer.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} of prohibition of alcohol {{was a major}} issue in South Carolina during Tillman's governorship. Tillman opposed banning alcohol, but was careful to speak <b>well</b> <b>of</b> temperance advocates, many of whom were women. The concern Tillman had with alcohol issues was that they divided the white community, leaving openings for black Republicans to exploit.|$|E

5|$|After Hitler {{took control}} in Germany in 1933, Borah thought <b>well</b> <b>of</b> the new chancellor's {{repudiation}} of the war guilt and other clauses of the Versailles treaty, and saw much of value in his new social and economic programs. But he was utterly disgusted and alienated by the Nazi treatment of the Jews. This did not initially lead him {{to speak out against}} Nazi Germany, though many urged him to do so, as he felt that each nation had the right to run its own affairs. Borah opposed large-scale immigration by Jews from Germany, feeling that was impractical with millions of Americans unemployed. By 1938, Borah was speaking out against the continued persecutions, but still felt that the European issue could be settled if Germany's former colonies were returned. After the Munich Conference in September 1938, Borah issued a statement far more critical of Britain and France for deceiving Czechoslovakia into dismemberment, than of Germany for her aggression.|$|E
5|$|After Princess Bubblegum {{falls into}} the Lich's <b>well</b> <b>of</b> power, she is rushed to the Candy Kingdom {{hospital}} and saved. However, the Ice King feels that something is awry and tries to warn Finn, but Finn angrily scolds him and tells {{him to leave the}} kingdom. Finn and Jake then focus their energy on taking care of Princess Bubblegum, whose behavior seems off. At first, she claims that she needs some rest, but soon she begins acting strangely, such as convulsing in her bed. Finn leaves to acquire items that Bubblegum requests—which includes weapons-grade plutonium, ammonium, and gasoline among other items—and Jake tries to cheer Bubblegum up with a song.|$|E

They refused, telling Hall that nothing they could do would keep the book from being treated as pornography.|$|E
5|$|Chrissie {{plans to}} sell the pub to Johnny Allen (Billy Murray) and a mystery second buyer, and flee the country, {{although}} Phil and Grant Mitchell try to taunt her. Chrissie though, is unfazed, as Sharon still supports her – however, Grant finally convinces Sharon to visit Sam in prison. Sharon still believes Chrissie is innocent, but finally learns the truth when Chrissie makes an innocuous, but telling, comment. Realising that Sharon knows, Chrissie becomes distraught as she felt that so long as Sharon, Den's daughter, thought <b>well</b> <b>of</b> her, she could think <b>well</b> <b>of</b> herself. Panicking, she begins to make mistakes, arguing with Jake outside of Johnny's club. Chrissie had confessed her role in Den's death to Jake, and lets information regarding her guilt slip as they argue. This is caught on CCTV by Johnny, who delights in telling Jake {{that he has a}} recording. Chrissie asks to get the money for The Queen Victoria right away, and Johnny takes advantage, saying the only way she will get the money is if she sleeps with him. Chrissie resists, saying that she will not hurt Jake. Johnny tells her that she will not receive the money, and tells Phil and Grant about the tape.|$|E
5|$|Gradually, {{women began}} to author their own {{thoughts}} and literary works about lesbian relationships. Until {{the publication of}} The <b>Well</b> <b>of</b> Loneliness, most major works involving lesbianism were penned by men. Foster suggests that women would have encountered suspicion about their own lives had they used same-sex love as a topic, and that some writers including Louise Labé, Charlotte Charke, and Margaret Fuller either changed the pronouns in their literary works to male, or made them ambiguous. Author George Sand was portrayed as a character in several works in the 19th century; writer Mario Praz credited the popularity of lesbianism as a theme to Sand's appearance in Paris society in the 1830s. Charlotte Brontë's Villette in 1853 initiated a genre of boarding school stories with homoerotic themes.|$|E

5|$|In 33 AD, Tiberius gave Caligula {{an honorary}} quaestorship, a {{position}} he held until his rise to emperor. Meanwhile, both Caligula's mother and his brother Drusus died in prison. Caligula was briefly married to Junia Claudilla, in 33, though she died in childbirth the following year. Caligula spent time befriending the Praetorian prefect, Naevius Sutorius Macro, an important ally. Macro spoke <b>well</b> <b>of</b> Caligula to Tiberius, attempting to quell any ill will or suspicion the Emperor felt towards Caligula.|$|E
5|$|In {{its third}} year in London, the 2015 show had 15,000 visitors. The fourth London show in October 2016 was {{three times the size}} of the {{original}} exhibition, and had expanded from a wing of the Somerset House to the rest of the building and its courtyard, where Zak Ové installed a site-specific work that was purchased for a sculpture park in Berkshire. The 2016 fair featured 130 artists, including the fair's first artists representing Egypt, Ethiopia, and Ghana. Koyo Kouoh's forum series returned to the event as <b>well.</b> <b>Of</b> the 40 exhibitors from 18 countries, 40 percent were from Africa and 17 galleries debuted at the show. The fair's founder viewed these expansions as a sign of progress for the African art market. She hopes to hold future 1:54 fairs in Africa.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1920s Radclyffe Hall drew a crowd after her novel The <b>Well</b> <b>of</b> Loneliness had been {{banned in the}} UK.

At another Friday salon in the 1930s Virgil Thomson sang from Four Saints in Three Acts, an opera based on a {{libretto}} by Gertrude Stein.|$|E
5|$|Jones {{returns to}} his {{teaching}} position at a New England college, where he is interviewed by two Army Intelligence agents. They inform him that the Nazis are searching for his old mentor, Abner Ravenwood, under whom Jones studied at the University of Chicago. The Nazis know that Ravenwood is the leading expert on the ancient city of Tanis in Egypt, and that he possesses the headpiece of the Staff of Ra. Jones deduces that the Nazis are searching for the Ark of the Covenant – the Nazis believe that if they acquire the Ark, their armies will become invincible. The Staff of Ra {{is the key to}} finding the <b>Well</b> <b>of</b> Souls, a secret chamber in which the Ark is buried.|$|E
5|$|Lesbians {{depicted}} in literature were relatively {{rare in the}} 1950s. It was the publisher's policy in any novel involving lesbianism that the characters would never receive any satisfaction from the relationship. One or both usually ended up committing suicide, going insane, or leaving the relationship. Marijane Meaker discusses this in the 2004 foreword of Spring Fire: she was told by editor Dick Carroll that because the books were distributed by the U.S. Post Office instead of private companies delivering directly to stores, postal inspectors would send the books back to the publisher if homosexuality was depicted positively. The Postal Service relaxed their censorship after several First Amendment obscenity trials, including Roth v. United States and another regarding Allen Ginsberg's Howl in the mid-1950s, which gave Bannon a modicum of freedom in her plots. Although the ending to Odd Girl Out did not veer {{too far from the}} unsatisfactory resolution formula of Spring Fire, Women's Barracks, and Radclyffe Hall's The <b>Well</b> <b>of</b> Loneliness, it examined Laura's internal struggle in the realization that despite her femininity, she was deeply in love with another woman, and at the end she embraced it, which was rare in lesbian fiction.|$|E
