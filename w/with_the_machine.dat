5|$|Franklin's {{electrostatic}} {{machine is}} a high-voltage static electricity generating device used by Benjamin Franklin in the mid-eighteenth century for research into electrical phenomena. Its key components are a glass globe which turned on an axis via a crank; a cloth pad {{in contact with}} the spinning globe; a set of metal needles to conduct away the charge developed on the globe by its friction with the pad; and a Leyden jara high-voltage capacitorto accumulate the charge. Franklin's experiments <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> eventually led to new theories about electricity and inventing the lightning rod.|$|E
5|$|As CTroop {{reached the}} forming up {{point for the}} assault it met heavy machine gun fire from the gun battery. ATroop {{bypassed}} them to occupy houses to cover the assault. The next to arrive was DTroop, which had a special ladder to cross the anti-tank ditch around the battery. Realising that the man carrying the ladder had been killed crossing the beach and the ladder left behind, they looked for another way to cross. They discovered wooden planks bridging the gap that the defenders used to access the town. DTroop crossed and captured the machine gun posts around the battery. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> guns taken, EandFTroops began their assault. The attack was successful but they discovered the guns were only wooden dummies made from telegraph poles. The real guns had been removed three days previously and positioned further inland.|$|E

5|$|The RLM {{considered}} {{setting up}} production facilities in Slovakia. But this would delay production until {{the buildings and}} factories could be furnished <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> tools. These tools were also in short supply, and the RLM hoped to purchase them from Switzerland and Italy. The Slovaks could provide 3,500–4,000 workers, but no technical personnel. The move would only produce another 25 machines per month {{at a time when}} demand was increasing. In October, production plans were dealt another blow when one of WFGs plants burned down, leaving a chronic shortage of tailwheels and undercarriage parts. Junkers director and member of the Luftwaffe industry council Carl Frytag reported that by January 1943 only 120 Ju 87s could be produced at Bremen and 230 at Berlin-Tempelhof.|$|E
5|$|This {{conversation}} {{coincided with}} the Gotha Raids in which German heavy bombers attacked London. He attempted interceptions against the high-flying machines and on 13 June finally got to within range of one. He fired but it swerved and resumed course. He chased the formation 21 miles out to sea but could not get closer than 500 feet. On 7 July he succeeded in hitting the Gotha crewed by Leutnant Erwin Kollberg and Walter Aschoff (of bomber unit Bogohl 3). He damaged a second and narrowly avoided a collision <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> as he flew by. On one raid a Gotha gunner's bullet struck his windshield.

5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{reception}} to Galaxy Game, Pitts and Tuck started work on an expanded prototype. For the second machine, they built a full blue fiberglass casing for the consoles, improved the quality of the joysticks {{with the help of a}} machine shop, and modified the computer with a newer display processor to support up to four games at once on different monitors—either multiple simultaneous separate games or up to four players playing the same game on two screens. They also placed the PDP-11 inside one of the consoles rather than in a separate location. While the original plan had been to work on driving down the development costs after the initial prototype, the popularity of the game convinced the pair to instead focus on making a better machine that could run multiple games to recoup the upfront investment. The new version was installed in a cafe in the student union building in June 1972, though with only two monitors due to space restrictions. The original Galaxy Game prototype was displayed at several locations around the area, but was not as successful as it had been at the student union building. By the time the second prototype was completed the pair had spent US$65,000 on the project and had no feasible way of making up the cost <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> or commercial prospects for a wider release. Pitts later explained that he and Tuck had been focused on the engineering and technical challenges of producing a faithful coin-operated Spacewar game and paid little attention to the business side of the project; he felt that Computer Space had been more commercially successful because Bushnell had focused more on the business side of his idea than the technical.|$|E

5|$|In 1809, Napoleon I of France {{arrived at}} Schönbrunn Palace {{to play the}} Turk. According to an {{eyewitness}} report, Mälzel took responsibility {{for the construction of}} the machine while preparing the game, and the Turk (Johann Baptist Allgaier) saluted Napoleon {{before the start of the}} match. The details of the match have been published over the years in numerous accounts, many of them contradictory. According to Bradley Ewart, it is believed that the Turk sat at its cabinet, and Napoleon sat at a separate chess table. Napoleon's table was in a roped-off area and he was not allowed to cross into the Turk's area, with Mälzel crossing back and forth to make each player's move and allowing a clear view for the spectators. In a surprise move, Napoleon took the first turn instead of allowing the Turk to make the first move, as was usual; but Mälzel allowed the game to continue. Shortly thereafter, Napoleon attempted an illegal move. Upon noticing the move, the Turk returned the piece to its original spot and continued the game. Napoleon attempted the illegal move a second time, and the Turk responded by removing the piece from the board entirely and taking its turn. Napoleon then attempted the move a third time, the Turk responding with a sweep of its arm, knocking all the pieces off the board. Napoleon was reportedly amused, and then played a real game <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>machine,</b> completing nineteen moves before tipping over his king in surrender. Alternate versions of the story include Napoleon being unhappy about losing to the machine, playing the machine at a later time, playing one match with a magnet on the board, and playing a match with a shawl around the head and body of the Turk in an attempt to obscure its vision.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the society}} seems {{on the edge}} of a {{revolution}} (or some other unspecified major change), the future of the novel is optimistic. As Katin reveals in one of his expository monologues, the problem of labor alienation has been overcome through the use of technology: practically all humans have cyborg socket implants that allow them to interface directly <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>machines</b> they use. These sockets are highly adaptable. Characters plug them into everything from small vacuum cleaners to the navigational systems of starships. By directly interfacing <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>machines,</b> workers are able to identify with their work, and the result is greater psychological wellbeing and less labor alienation.|$|R

50|$|Fully {{automatic}} systems {{allow the}} ability of <b>the</b> <b>machine's</b> implements {{to be controlled by}} the GPS guidance system. This is typically used in the fine grading applications where precise levels of material need to be moved on a predetermined design or grade. The advantages to this system is due to the accuracy that can be achieved with GPS and RTK, but requires an onsite base station. These systems can use either one or two GPS receivers and are mounted on <b>the</b> <b>machine's</b> blade. <b>The</b> more advanced systems use two receivers since it allows <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> to be controlled in a three-dimensional design. Fully automatic systems require the GPS guidance system to be integrated in <b>the</b> <b>machine's</b> implement controls. Some manufacturers sell <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>with</b> these controls already integrated into <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> as an option. Aftermarket kits are available that can retrofit your existing machine to fully automatic control, but requires the GPS system to interface <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>machine's</b> implement controls. This is typically done one of two ways. If <b>the</b> <b>machine's</b> implements are controlled using electric over hydraulic (EH), the GPS system can input lever commands in parallel <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>machine's</b> implement lever. <b>The</b> output from the GPS system is interpreted by <b>the</b> <b>machine's</b> electronic control module as a lever command given by the operator and moves the implements accordingly. The second method for integrating GPS in <b>the</b> <b>machine's</b> implement controls is by adding a second pilot hydraulic valve in parallel <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>machine's</b> pilot hydraulic valve. This second valve is controlled by the GPS system and moves the implement valve according to the system design and blade location. Types of machines that use fully automatic GPS systems include TTT and MG.|$|R
