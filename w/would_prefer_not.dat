25|$|For example, {{people with}} Tourette {{syndrome}} and related tic disorders make involuntary movements and utterances (called tics) {{despite the fact}} that they <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>not</b> to do so when it is socially inappropriate. Tics are described as semi-voluntary or unvoluntary, because they are not strictly involuntary: they may be experienced as a voluntary response to an unwanted, premonitory urge. Tics are experienced as irresistible and must eventually be expressed. People with Tourette syndrome are sometimes able to suppress their tics for limited periods, but doing so often results in an explosion of tics afterward. The control exerted (from seconds to hours at a time) may merely postpone and exacerbate the ultimate expression of the tic.|$|E
25|$|In {{the longer}} term, FWS plans to create up to 30 acres (12 ha) of {{additional}} grassland {{by removing the}} runway pavement and restoring the original cover.

While grasses are already beginning to grow through cracks in the runways, the agency <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>not</b> to wait as aircraft continue to make illegal landings at the refuge, disturbing the birds, despite markings on the runways themselves and on aviation charts of the area indicating that the facility is closed. It has not yet determined how this will be done in the most environmentally sensitive fashion. Similarly, it hopes to restore the original stream pattern through the property by removing the culverts and other reroutings made during construction of the airfield.|$|E

25|$|A {{panel of}} The Heart Rhythm Society, a {{specialist}} {{organization based in}} Washington, DC {{found that it was}} legal and ethical to honor requests by patients, or by those with legal authority to make decisions for patients, to deactivate implanted cardiac devices. Lawyers say that the legal situation is similar to removing a feeding tube, though there is currently no legal precedent involving pacemakers in the United States of America. A patient in the United States is thought to have a right to refuse or discontinue treatment, including a pacemaker that keeps him or her alive. Physicians have a right to refuse to turn it off, but are advised by the HRS panel that they should refer the patient to a physician who will. Some patients believe that hopeless, debilitating conditions, like those brought on by severe strokes or late-stage dementia, can cause so much suffering that they <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>not</b> to prolong their lives with supportive measures, such as cardiac devices.|$|E

[...] The lawyer cannot bring himself to remove his clerk from his office and finally resorts to moving out himself. Leading scholar on the short fiction Merton Sealts notes that in [...] "Bartleby" [...] knowing references to current events occur, and the supporting characters of Nippers, Turkey, and the errand boy Ginger Nut [...] "could easily have come from the pen of Dickens, Lamb, or Irving." ...|$|E

But one day, when asked to help proofread a document, Bartleby answers with what soon becomes his perpetual response to every request [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>not</b> to." [...] To the dismay of the lawyer and the irritation of the other employees, Bartleby performs fewer and fewer tasks and eventually none, instead staring {{for long periods of}} time at a brick wall just outside one of the office's windows. The narrator makes several futile attempts to reason with him and to learn something about him; when he stops by the office one Sunday morning, he discovers that Bartleby has started living there.|$|E

2500|$|Bartleby the Scrivener {{explores the}} theme of {{isolation}} in American life and the workplace through actual physical and mental loneliness. [...] Although all of the characters at the office are related by being co-workers, Bartleby {{is the only one}} whose name is known to us and seems serious, as the rest of characters have odd nicknames, such as [...] "Nippers" [...] or [...] "Turkey", this excludes him from being normal in the workplace. Bartleby's former job was at the [...] "Dead Letter Office" [...] that received mail with nowhere to go, representing the isolation of communication that Bartleby had at both places of work, being that he was given a separate work area for himself at the lawyer's office.

2500|$|Despite this success, Belisarius {{was well}} aware that his {{situation}} was still dangerous. He therefore {{wrote a letter to}} Justinian, asking for aid. Indeed, Justinian had already dispatched reinforcements under the tribunes Martinus and Valerian, but they had been delayed in Greece due to bad weather. In his letter, Belisarius also added cautionary words concerning the loyalty of the populace: [...] "And although at the present time the Romans are well disposed toward us, yet when their troubles are prolonged, they will probably not hesitate to choose the course which is better for their own interests. [...] Furthermore, the Romans will be compelled by hunger to do many things they <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>not</b> to do." [...] For fear of treason, extreme measures were taken by Belisarius: Pope Silverius was deposed on suspicions of negotiating with the Goths and replaced by Vigilius, the locks and keys of the gates were changed [...] "twice each month", the guards on gate duty regularly rotated, and patrols set up.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tone of the}} Moria {{sequence}} was altered. In the book, {{following the}} defeat on the Caradhras road, Gandalf advocates the Moria road against {{the resistance of the}} rest of the Fellowship (save Gimli), suggesting [...] "there is a hope that Moria is still free...there is even a chance that Dwarves are there," [...] though no one seems to think this likely. [...] Frodo proposes they take a company vote, but the discovery of Wargs on their trail forces them to accept Gandalf's proposal. [...] They only realize the Dwarves are all dead once they reach Balin's tomb. [...] The filmmakers chose instead for Gandalf to resist the Moria plan as a foreshadowing device. Gandalf says to Gimli he <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>not</b> to enter Moria, and Saruman is shown to be aware of Gandalf's hesitance, revealing an illustration of the Balrog in one of his books. The corpses of the dwarves are instantly shown as the Fellowship enter Moria. One detail that many critics commented upon is the fact that, in the novel, Pippin tosses a mere pebble into the well in Moria ("They then hear what sounds like a hammer tapping in the distance"), whereas in the film, he knocks an entire skeleton in ("Next, the skeleton ... falls down the well, also dragging down a chain and bucket.

In the past, St. John's College chose {{not to participate in}} any collegiate rankings surveys and did not provide requested survey information. However, the school was still included in many ranking guides. In 2014, Annapolis President Christopher B. Nelson wrote a post to address the issue in his SignPosts for Liberal Education blog: After many years of refusing to participate at all in the rankings generated by U.S. News & World Report—one of the most prominent providers of college rankings—St. John's this year submitted statistical information for its survey. This change in practice was prompted by engaged parents who increasingly were asking whether the underlying data about St. John's in U.S. News was reliable. Since we were not submitting information, we could not vouch for its reliability. Although St. John's <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>not</b> to be ranked, and has long asked not to be ranked, U.S. News continued to rank us. We concluded, therefore, that we had to supply statistical data in order to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information U.S. News was publishing about us.St. John's experienced an unprecedented leap upward in the 2014 U.S. News rankings after submitting data (as opposed to not providing information and still being ranked), as reported in the Washington Post.|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, British Prime Minister Tony Blair advised Queen Elizabeth II {{to confer}} on Black a life peerage {{with the title}} of Baron Black of Crossharbour. He would sit as a {{conservative}} peer, and his name had been put forward by the then conservative leader, William Hague. Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien advised the Queen not to appoint Black a peer, citing the Nickle Resolution of 1919 and a long history since then of objections to Canadian citizens accepting British peerages. Black at the time held both Canadian and British citizenship. Black {{pointed out that the}} Nickle Resolution referred to Canadian resident citizens, not dual citizens living in the U.K and was not binding, but when Prime Minister Blair said the Queen <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>not</b> to choose between the conflicting recommendations of two prime ministers of countries of which she was the monarch, Black asked that the matter be deferred. He litigated in Canada, claiming that Chrétien had no jurisdiction to create a class of citizen in another country, consisting of one person (as there were other dual citizens in the House of Lords), ineligible to receive an honour in that country for services deemed to have been rendered in that country, because of the personal objections of the Canadian Prime Minister of the day. Later in 2001, after the Ontario Superior Court and Court of Appeal had ruled that they had no jurisdiction in this area, Black renounced his Canadian citizenship, remaining a United Kingdom citizen, which allowed him to accept the peerage without further controversy.|$|E
