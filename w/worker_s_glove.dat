Learning together is a good, practical handbook for that purpose, dealing with both practice and theory. One section deals with communication and best and worst practices. Another describes the various steps to define the need, content, planning and implementation of training. Links with agriculture and related issues cover participation, gender issues, local knowledge and cultural aspects. Taking these into account will heighten the impact of your training. Finally, while practical examples, tools, role-plays can be found throughout the entire book, there is also a concluding section dedicated to making your own materials.

40|$|A Segurança Alimentar e Nutricional do trabalhador brasileiro é uma das formas de garantia de saúde e conseqüente aumento de produtividade refletido pelo compromisso do PAT Programa de Alimentação do Trabalhador que completou 30 anos em 2006. O objetivo do estudo é relacionar a variação de preços das {{commodities}} de alimentos presentes na refeição do trabalhador de acordo com o sistema normativo do PAT, identificando possíveis conseqüências negativas à Segurança Alimentar do Trabalhador no Brasil. A metodologia, por meio da análise de regressão múltipla, utiliza os dados de ICV Índice de Custo de Vida - de alimentação fora do domicílio como proxy a alimentação do trabalhador. Os resultados sugerem que os alimentos que apresentaram variação negativa com os tipos de refeições analisadas, como a carne suína e a soja, podem ser substituídos por outro valor nutricional semelhante como a carne bovina, o frango e o óleo de milho. Apenas a variação do preço do feijão foi seguida pelo aumento do preço do prato comercial, cuja alternativa é a mudança na maneira de oferecer a refeiç ão ao trabalhador, como os restaurantes por quilo. Diante do cenário exposto, há indícios de que a variação de preços dos alimentos no mercado de commodities teria pouca influência no preço final das refeições, mas a discussão em torno da futura escassez de oferta de alimentos devido ao aumento da população mundial e a mudança dos padrões alimentares com as sociedades urbanizadas insere o risco da SAN no contexto político e econômico da nutrição.

According to the exposed scenery, there are indications that the variation of prices in the food commodities market would have little influence in the final price of the meals, but the discussion around the future shortage of offer of foods due to the increase of the world population and the change of the alimentary patters with the urbanized societies inserts the risk of the Nutrition and Food Security in the political and economical context of the nutrition.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{characterize}} the equilibrium in a labor market where employed workers search {{on the job}} and firms direct the search by announcing wages and employment probabilities for the applicants. All workers/jobs are homogeneous and free entry of firms determines the number of jobs. The equilibrium features a wage ladder, with a finite number of rungs. Workers on each particular rung of the ladder choose (optimally) to apply to only the jobs at one level above their current wage, despite that they observe all higher wage offers. Workers choose not to leap several rungs at a time on the wage ladder because the jobs at one level above their current wage provide a significantly higher employment probability, and hence a higher expected surplus, than the jobs at two or more levels above. The wage ladder has the following properties: (i) The gap between two adjacent rungs on the ladder becomes smaller and smaller as wage increases; (ii) A <b>worker</b> <b>s</b> quit rate decreases with wage; (iii) A <b>worker</b> <b>s</b> wage, on average, increases with the employment duration; (iv) The average length of time an unemployed worker will take to return to his previous wage increases with that wage; (v) The density of offer wages decreases with wage; (vi) The density of employed wages can be decreasing, increasing, or hump-shaped. The directed search framework replicates empirical regularities on the wage path of workers and the distribution of offer and employed wages that undirected search cannot.
