2500|$|Following this, the Congressional Union {{sent two}} {{organizers}} {{to each of}} the nine states where women had the right to vote. [...] Burns went to San Francisco, California with suffragist Rose Winslow. Organizing women in these states was not an easy task, and raising adequate funds was found to be particularly troublesome; Burns is quoted as saying “If the <b>women</b> <b>here,</b> however, would only give me the money they are willing to spend on luncheons and dinners I will get along admirably.” Burns spread the message about suffrage in theaters, on the streets, by going door-to-door, and by circulating cartoons and pamphlets. By election time in 1914 the Democratic Party had become an extremely vocal critic of the Congressional Union, and ultimately the Congressional Union claimed responsibility for five Democratic losses.|$|E
