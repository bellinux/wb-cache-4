40|$|We {{consider}} the compatibility of the {{equations of motion}} <b>which</b> <b>follow</b> from d’Alembert’s principle {{in the case of}} a general autonomous non-holonomic mechanical system in N dimensions, with those equations <b>which</b> <b>follow</b> for the same system by assuming the validity of a specific variational action principle, in which the non-holonomic conditions are implemented by means of the multiplication rule in the calculus of variations. The equations of motion <b>which</b> <b>follow</b> from the principle of d’Alembert are not identical to the equations <b>which</b> <b>follow</b> from the variational action principle. We give a proof that the solutions to the equations of motion <b>which</b> <b>follow</b> from d’Alembert’s principle do not in general satisfy the equations <b>which</b> <b>follow</b> from the action principle with non-holonomic constraints. Thus the principle of d’Alembert and the minimal action principle involving the multiplication rule are not compatible in the case of systems with non-holonomic constraints. For simplicity the proof is given for autonomous systems only, with one general non-holonomic constraint, which is linear in the generalized velocities of the system...|$|R

The simplest architecture is the ripple carry adder, <b>which</b> <b>follows</b> the standard multi-digit algorithm.

The third ending is similar, having Billy die and Kelli's parents picking her up, however his body disappears and the last shot shows someone moving through the vents, indicating that either Agnes or Billy are still alive. The first ending, <b>which</b> <b>follows</b> the original script, ends with both Kelli and Leigh surviving and Kelli getting a call from someone using Kyle's cellphone.|$|E
