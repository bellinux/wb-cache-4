In case the pressure wave has created a leak downstream of the {{flashback arrestor}}, it will remain switched off until someone resets it.|$|E

The DVLMF accepted another $200,000 combined donation that month from the DAV, which reported that it had contributed less than $2 million of its $3 million matching-fund commitment. The DAV's donation pushed the total funds raised for the memorial past the $70 million mark.

500|$|The primary {{place in}} which SQL three-valued logic intersects with SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) {{is in the form}} of check {{constraint}}s. A check constraint placed on a column operates under a slightly different set of rules than those for the DML WHERE clause. While a DML WHERE clause must evaluate to True for a row, a check constraint must not evaluate to False. (From a logic perspective, the designated values are True and Unknown.) This means that a check constraint will succeed if the result of the check is either True or Unknown. [...] The following example table <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>check</b> constraint will prohibit any integer values from being inserted into column i, but will allow Null to be inserted since the result of the check will always evaluate to Unknown for Nulls.|$|E
