5|$|It {{was written}} in the L.A. sun on an {{afternoon}} with my friend David Poe. We <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> how you sometimes know that you would be better at love if only you were older. But you can't rush old. You have to be young and dumb and let time do its thing before you get the experience you need to handle love right.|$|E
5|$|Rees {{writes that}} Gröning {{describes}} {{his time at}} Auschwitz as if he <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> another Oskar Gröning at Auschwitz — and as a result, the post-war Gröning speaks more candidly about his time there by segregating the Gröning {{that contributed to the}} running of a death camp from the modern Gröning that condemns Nazi ideology.|$|E
5|$|A Naval Board of Inquiry was convened on July 21, 1944, to {{find out}} what had happened. The {{official}} proceeding lasted for 39 days and included interviews with witnesses who were officers, civilians and enlisted men. Ordnance experts were questioned as well as inspectors who had overseen previous loading procedures. Five African Americans were questioned, none of whom were later to refuse to load ammunition. Captain Kinne's posted division tonnage results came to light in the inquiry but Kinne stated that the competition to load the most tonnage did not make for unsafe conditions; he implied that any junior officers who said so did not know what they <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b>|$|E
5000|$|During a Frontline {{interview}} {{describing the}} former president's ascendance {{into the national}} political arena, McKinnon said, [...] "Governor Bush was doing some things that really got my attention. He <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> education reform. He <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> immigration reform. He <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> issues that had typically been Democratic issues. He <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> them in a really compassionate way."

5000|$|On the show, James said, [...] "Well, I don't {{know who}} he <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> for sure, Chris, but if he wasn't <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> Barack Obama, he should have <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> Barack Obama, I hope he <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> Barack Obama." [...] The other guest, Air America Radio {{president}} and Democratic politician Mark J. Green, denounced Bush's comparison.|$|R

5|$|Globocnik and I <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> Operation Reinhard, {{which was}} in full effect {{following}} Heydrich's murder, and also the construction of Sobibor and Treblinka. I know I asked him about Höss, who was also standing there and had been summoned by Himmler regarding logistics or something regarding the new camp (Auschwitz). Then Globocnik mentioned to me and Kaltenbrunner that Lidice had been cleared, and all the Jews and Czechs had been dealt with. I noticed that this young pilot, who I later learned was Marseille, must have overheard, and I debated whether I should go over and say something to him. I decided against it.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the episode come from a {{conversation}} between Jane O'Brien and Mike Scully, when the two <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> how girls always want to grow up so fast, as Scully has five daughters; {{so they decided to}} produce an episode with a storyline based on this. The idea behind the episode plot came from Jace Richdale, {{who came up with the}} idea of Homer stealing grease and the grease business, having read about in a magazine. Several aspects of the characters used throughout the episode had been improvised significantly by Lisa Kudrow. Ron Hauge, a writer for The Simpsons, came up with the initial character of Alex, and Jane O'Brien named the character after her best friend. The scene showing Homer's hemorrhaged eye as Groundskeeper Willie strangles him got a big laugh in the studio. Mike Scully comments that he now uses it in college clip shows.|$|E

As of version 1.4 the multiplayer still only supported small maps, which is not enough for 16 players.|$|E

25|$|Fernando de Alva Cortés Ixtlilxóchitl, a mestizo {{historian}} and descendant of Coanacoch, wrote {{an account of}} the executions in the 17th century partly based on Texcocan oral tradition. According to Ixtlilxóchitl, the three lords were joking cheerfully with one another because of a rumor that Cortés had decided to return the expedition to Mexico, when Cortés asked a spy to tell him what they <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> The spy reported honestly, but Cortés invented the plot himself. Cuauhtémoc, Coanacoch, and Tetlepanquetzal were hanged as well as eight others. However, Cortés cut down Coanacoch, the last to be hanged, after his brother began rallying his warriors. Coanacoch did not have long to enjoy his reprieve, as Ixtlilxóchitl wrote that he died a few days later.|$|E

25|$|During {{this time}} Bunyan, whilst on his travels as a tinker, {{happened}} to be in Bedford and pass a group of women who <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> spiritual matters on their doorstep. The women were in fact some of the founding members of the Bedford Free Church or Meeting and Bunyan, who had been attending the parish church of Elstow, was so impressed by their talk that he joined their church. At that time the nonconformist group was meeting in St John's church in Bedford under the leadership of former Royalist army officer John Gifford. At the instigation of other members of the congregation Bunyan began to preach, both in the church and to groups of people in the surrounding countryside. In 1656, having by this time moved his family to St Cuthbert's Street in Bedford, he published his first book, Gospel Truths Opened, which was inspired by a dispute with Quakers.|$|E
25|$|Finding {{the barrio}} Capaya {{completely}} deserted, the platoon ganged-up on Duman who was brusquely interrogated regarding the Katupunero band that raided Bo. Capaya and {{the whereabouts of}} the entire barrio population. The poor Duman, knowing nothing of what transpired in his village as his field was quite far from the village, answered he knew nothing what the soldiers <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> Immediately, he was branded as a big liar and was quickly {{accused of being a}} Katipunero himself! The guards took turns in hitting him with their rifle butts on the head, chest and back to force him to talk, but Duman only wept in pain and insisted that he knew nothing. The soldiers continued to beat him up until nothing but blood came out of his mouth, nose and ears. Exasperated, the soldiers tied his elbows in miquit-a-sicu fashion, and with a long rope tied around his neck, the bloodied Duman was taken on foot to the town hall for further interrogation. Once inside the municipal jail, the guards mercilessly beat him up with solid bamboo clubs to extract revolutionary information to no avail. No food or water was given him.|$|E
