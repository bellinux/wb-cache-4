5|$|After the Gold Rush had concluded, gold {{recovery}} operations continued. The final stage to recover loose gold was to prospect for gold that had slowly <b>washed</b> <b>down</b> into the flat river bottoms and sandbars of California's Central Valley and other gold-bearing areas of California (such as Scott Valley in Siskiyou County). By the late 1890s, dredging technology (also invented in California) had become economical, {{and it is}} estimated that more than 20million ounces (620t) were recovered by dredging (worth approximately US$28billion at December 2010 prices).|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1950s Waugh was troubled {{on a number}} of fronts. He was afflicted with writer's block, and was unable to make {{progress}} with his current novel, the second in his Sword of Honour trilogy. He had financial worries, a legacy of his free-spending post-war habits combined with accumulated tax liabilities and a lack of remunerative productivity. His general health was poor; he suffered from toothache, sciatica and rheumatism, and his memory was faulty. He was also drinking heavily, the effects of which were aggravated by a large intake of chloral and bromide <b>washed</b> <b>down</b> with crème de menthe—a treatment for insomnia that he concealed from his doctors.|$|E

5|$|Tremo gained Poniatowski's trust as {{the cook}} able to satisfy both his palate and his dietary requirements. The teetotal king {{suffered}} from gastric ailments {{from an early}} age. He usually started his day {{with a cup of}} hot chocolate or bouillon. His favourite dish was roast or stewed mutton, which he <b>washed</b> <b>down</b> with spring water. Tremo often consulted royal menus with the court physician and occasionally prepared separate dishes specifically for the king to accommodate his sensitive stomach. Tomatoes, for example, were considered detrimental to the monarch's health and were never used in Tremo's recipes.|$|E
5|$|A {{storm in}} June 2011 caused public {{utilities}} including the Briarcliff library and Law Memorial Park's public pool and playing fields to be flooded. When Trump had renovated the course, his workers made unauthorized changes to its drainage system, {{which made the}} course look and play better for golfers. The alterations lowered the system's water capacity and thus raised water levels by about six feet. The Trump Organization met with the village over the issue, though {{it did not take}} corrective actions. After negotiations ended, the village billed the club $238,353. The Trump Organization blamed the flooding on a village drainage pipe which lacked a grate, and blamed the conflict on then-Briarcliff mayor William Vescio, who owns a company that previously came into conflict with Trump. Vescio denied the relation to the previous conflict and claimed that the flooding was caused by rocks and trees at <b>washed</b> <b>down</b> the hill from the golf club.|$|E
25|$|There were {{occasionally}} men {{and women}} who so longed after the other that some jumped into the river that separated them in a vain attempt to reunite with their loved ones. Unfortunately the currents of the river were too strong and the swimmers were <b>washed</b> <b>down</b> the river, never to be seen again.|$|E
40|$|Vehicles {{are one of}} {{the major}} vectors of long-distance weed seed spread. Viable seed removed from {{vehicles}} at roadside <b>wash</b> <b>down</b> facilities was studied at five locations in central Queensland, Australia over a 3 -year period. Seed from 145 plant species, belonging to 34 different families, were identified in the sludge samples obtained from the wet particulate matter collection pit of the <b>wash</b> <b>down</b> facilities. Most of the species were annual forbs (50 %) with small or very small seed size...|$|R

25|$|The Hell Hole dam, a rock-fill-type dam, was {{completed}} across the Rubicon River in December 1964. As the reservoir began filling the dam sprung a leak during a flood event and failed completely the next day.

25|$|On 9 August 1967, Kenneth Halliwell bludgeoned 34-year-old Orton {{to death}} {{at their home}} at 25 Noel Road, Islington, London, with nine hammer blows to the head, and then {{committed}} suicide with an overdose of 22 Nembutal tablets <b>washed</b> <b>down</b> with the juice from canned grapefruit. Investigators determined that Halliwell had died first, because Orton's sheets were still warm.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other 4x4s {{such as the}} Jeep Wagoneer, the {{original}} Range Rover was not designed as a luxury-type vehicle. While certainly up-market compared to preceding Land Rover models, the early Range Rovers had fairly basic, utilitarian interiors with vinyl seats and plastic dashboards that were designed to be <b>washed</b> <b>down</b> with a hose. Convenience features such as power steering, carpeted floors, air conditioning, cloth/leather seats, and wooden interior trim were fitted later.|$|E

The landing ellipse also contains a rock type that is very dense, very brightly colored, and unlike any rock type previously investigated on Mars. It may be an ancient playa lake deposit, and it will likely be the mission's first target in checking for the presence of organic molecules.|$|E
25|$|The vast {{majority}} of the South Fork watershed is mountains, with the only level land found in the Hyampom Valley at the confluence of the river and Hayfork Creek, along the Hayfork valley, and along narrow river terraces. There are large parts of the watershed where the ground is composed of stable bedrock, while large portions of hillsides are composed of loose soil and rock. Historically, riverbeds in the watershed were narrow and rocky, but due to vast amounts of silt <b>washed</b> <b>down</b> by poor logging practices, streambeds have become wide, braided, elevated and shallow.|$|E
25|$|At first no {{suitable}} coffin for {{the body}} could be located. The muddy roads were too flooded for anyone to get {{in or out of}} the town of Lexington. An undertaker had ordered three from Richmond that had reached Lexington, but due to unprecedented flooding from long-continued heavy rains, the caskets were <b>washed</b> <b>down</b> the Maury River. Two neighborhood boys, C.G. Chittum and Robert E. Hillis, found one of the coffins that had been swept ashore. Undamaged, it was used for the General's body, though it was a bit short for him. As a result, Lee was buried without shoes. He was buried underneath Lee Chapel at Washington and Lee University, where his body remains.|$|E
5000|$|Cape May is {{the home}} of the {{so-called}} [...] "Cape May Diamonds". They show up at Sunset Beach and other beaches in the area. These are in fact clear quartz pebbles that <b>wash</b> <b>down</b> from the Delaware River. They begin as prismatic quartz (including the color sub-varieties such as Smoky Quartz and Amethyst) in the quartz veins alongside the Delaware River that get eroded out of the host rock and <b>wash</b> <b>down</b> 200 miles to the shore. Collecting Cape May diamonds is a popular pastime and many tourist shops sell them polished or even as faceted stones.|$|R

25|$|Much of the state's lands {{were formed}} from {{sediment}} <b>washed</b> <b>down</b> the Mississippi River, leaving enormous deltas and vast areas of coastal marsh and swamp. These contain a rich southern biota; typical examples include birds such as ibis and egrets. There are also {{many species of}} tree frogs, and fish such as sturgeon and paddlefish. In more elevated areas, fire is a natural process in the landscape, and has produced extensive areas of longleaf pine forest and wet savannas. These support an exceptionally large number of plant species, including many species of orchids and carnivorous plants. Louisiana has more Native American tribes than any other southern state, including four that are federally recognized, ten that are state recognized, and four {{that have not yet}} received recognition.|$|E
25|$|Modification of {{the river}} began in earnest {{with the arrival of}} the Florida East Coast Railway in Miami in 1896. There was much {{dredging}} and filling along the river. The rapids at the head of the South Fork were removed in 1908. From 1909 to 1912, the Miami Canal was dug, bypassing the rapids at the head of the North Fork. The canal was dammed off from the river for most of the construction period. When the canal was opened to the river in March 1912 large amounts of Everglades muck and finely ground stone from the dredging were <b>washed</b> <b>down</b> the river, silting it. As a result, the lower river had to be dredged three times in two years.|$|E
25|$|Miller {{ended his}} tour against the Combined Services at Kingston. Miller {{came to the}} crease at 1/2 after Morris was bowled for a duck. He counterattacked and reached his century before lunch, which he <b>washed</b> <b>down</b> with champagne. He then {{proceeded}} to 262notout with 34boundaries. This included a 377-run fourth-wicket stand by Jim de Courcy in only 205 minutes, followed by an unbeaten 126-run partnership with Craig. He particularly targeted Fred Trueman's bowling as Australia declared at 4/592. Trueman ended with 0/95 from 14 overs. He then took the first two wickets of the innings, both bowled, to leave the hosts at 2/28. He then returned to bowl Trueman and end with 3/17 as the Combined Services were bowled out for 161 and forced to follow on. He took another wicket, again castling the batsman, in the second innings as Australia easily won by an innings and 261 runs.|$|E

25|$|In {{the nave}} of the church, {{there are four}} burial graves, heavily damaged by digging after the funeral. Something better {{preserved}} is the grave no.23, buried along the southern wall. In the oak chest, of which only parts visible, was buried a young aristocrat woman. Judging from the preserved parts, she had a gilded robes on which was identified the ornaments of two-headed eagles, {{at the time of}} the excavation. On the ribbon of made of silver thread, thrown over her head, there were luxurious earrings. In her tomb was found the crop, one-third of the small silver coin. By hers tomb was another similar wooden oak chest, grave 22., from which remained only smaller parts. On the place where was one been head of the deceased, laid on a stone slab, was discovered a crop, one-third small silver coin – the same as in the tomb of the young aristocrat woman. Both coffins were simultaneously <b>washed</b> <b>down</b> with a plaster mass with a little stone, which were well preserved in the gap between sides they shared by.|$|E
25|$|The Susquehanna Boom {{lost its}} {{profitability}} for three main reasons. First was the periodic floods that swept down the West Branch Valley following the winter snow melt and the spring rains. The West Branch Valley was devastated by a flood in 1894. The sawmills {{along the river}} were largely destroyed. The boom was washed away close to two million of board feet (5,000 m³) of freshly cut timber were <b>washed</b> <b>down</b> the Susquehanna River. Second were the newly constructed railroads in North Central Pennsylvania. These railroads were able to transport the fresh timber more quickly and were less risky, expensive and dangerous than floating the logs down the West Branch Susquehanna River and its tributaries. Thirdly, little thought for the future was placed when the massive stands of old growth forest were harvested during the 19th century. The mountains were clear cut. The tops of the trees were left to dry. The passing steam trains spread burning embers along the railroad tracks. These embers would spark devastating fires that prevented the forests from regrowing. Without trees the sawmills could no longer process timber, the mills closed and eventually the boom itself was forced to close in 1908.|$|E
25|$|During November {{a series}} of floods {{affected}} many parts of Britain. On 22 November a man died after his car was <b>washed</b> <b>down</b> a flooded brook in Chew Stoke, Somerset and trapped against a small bridge. A 26-year-old man was also killed as his car overturned in torrential rain in Devon. In Sonning, Berkshire a 91-year-old was apparently witnessed to have gone swimming in the flooded Thames and was missing, feared dead. A Downing Street spokesman said that 300 properties were flooded in 24 hours in England and Wales on 22 November. Heavy rains led to overtopping of the Grand Western Canal near to Halberton, Devon forcing homes to be evacuated as the canal wall breached, spilling the canal contents on lower land. The Environment Agency and Police via the media stressed that motorists should take great care when driving through flood waters after {{a series of}} fatalities involving motorists during the flooding of 2012. In Welney, Norfolk a man who posted a video of driving a 4x4 vehicle through deep floodwaters along the closed A1101 road online, was branded as irresponsible and dangerous by Norfolk Police. While Cambridgeshire Police said that drivers who drove through floods and got stuck could face prosecution, after several vehicles were stranded in floodwaters.|$|E
