For a birth occurring without medical assistance or outside a medical center, the government may authorize late registration up until one year after the birth; thereafter, only judges may order birth registrations.|$|E
25|$|The American coot, {{unlike other}} parasitized species, {{has the ability}} to {{recognize}} and reject conspecific parasitic chicks from their brood. Parents aggressively reject parasite chicks by pecking them vigorously, drowning them, preventing them from entering the nest, etc. They learn to recognize their own chicks by imprinting on cues from the first chick that hatches. The first-hatched chick is a reference to <b>which</b> <b>parents</b> discriminate between later-hatched chicks. Chicks that do not match the imprinted cues are then recognized as parasite chicks and are rejected.|$|E
25|$|On 2 February 2012, Garrett, with Jenny Macklin, the Federal Indigenous Affairs Minister, {{announced}} {{an expansion of}} the Improving School Enrollment and Attendance through Welfare Reform Measure (SEAM), a controversial program under <b>which</b> <b>parents</b> of indigenous students in the Northern Territory can have their Centrelink payments suspended for three months if their children are not attending or enrolled in school. Though the Government claimed that the program improved indigenous school attendance, it was heavily criticised by indigenous spokespeople and academics for being excessively punitive rather than implementing other policies that have been far more effective in improving school attendance, such as reinstating bilingual learning. Furthermore, the Government was criticised for being deceptive about getting a mandate for this from consultation with indigenous leaders.|$|E

25|$|Early in the 20th century polio {{would become}} the world's most feared disease. The disease hit without warning, tended to strike white, {{affluent}} individuals, required long quarantine periods during <b>which</b> <b>parents</b> were separated from children: {{it was impossible to}} tell who would get the disease and who would be spared. The consequences of the disease left polio victims marked for life, leaving behind vivid images of wheelchairs, crutches, leg braces, breathing devices, and deformed limbs. However, polio changed not only the lives of those who survived it, but also affected profound cultural changes: the emergence of grassroots fund-raising campaigns that would revolutionize medical philanthropy, the rise of rehabilitation therapy and, through campaigns for the social and civil rights of the disabled, polio survivors helped to spur the modern disability rights movement.|$|E
25|$|Forced begging is a {{profitable}} practice in which exploiters {{are motivated by}} economic incentives. The business structures of major rings of children trafficked {{for the purpose of}} begging have been examined as comparable to a medium-size business enterprise. In the most severe cases networks of children forced to beg may generate $30–40,000 USD for the profiteer. Though family networks are not nearly as extensive, a study conducted in Albania showed that a family with multiple children begging can earn up to fifteen euros a day, an amount greater than the average national teacher salary. Anti-Slavery International asserts that because this income is relatively high many families believe it is the best option available given the lack of existing capabilities. Capability deprivation, meaning the routine absence of adequate resources that serve in facilitating opportunities, may account for cross-generational begging practices within families. UNICEF studies have found that begging is especially prevalent among families in <b>which</b> <b>parents</b> are incapacitated in some way, leading children to be the sole providers.|$|E
25|$|People {{possess an}} {{inherent}} ensemble of basic beliefs about themselves, others, the world, etc. Such “naïve theories” are what compose our symbolic universe. One’s symbolic universe {{is part of}} a socially shared knowledge, transmitted principally as a result of education and social communication, with a large emphasis on the process of attachment through <b>which</b> <b>parents</b> impart their visions of the world, their symbolic universes, to their children. Such symbolic universes guide how we make sense of the world, and are composed of a relatively stable network of ideologies. Therefore, if one of these beliefs is compromised, the stability of the entire network could be jeopardized. It is very important for people to maintain a sense of stability within such a system of beliefs, so they have a natural psychological motivation to try to protect these beliefs. Because such beliefs have a fundamentally social origin, their revalidation can only be legitimized through a social consensus. Along these lines, aforementioned social rituals came {{to be used as a}} more structured way of re-substantiating beliefs that have been invalidated as a result of an emotional event.|$|E

25|$|On January 20, 2005, District Court Judge Gary L. Lancaster {{dropped the}} charges, agreeing {{with the defense}} that the federal anti-obscenity {{statutes}} were unconstitutional, as they violated a person's fundamental right to possess and view whatever they want {{in the privacy of}} their own home. As a fundamental right had been violated, the government had to establish that a compelling state interest was involved. The prosecution argued that the government had a legitimate interest in protecting adults from unwitting exposure to obscenity, and protecting children from exposure to obscenity. These arguments were rejected by the court, which also ruled that the federal obscenity laws were not narrow enough to meet these interests, and could not justify a complete ban on obscene material. Lancaster ruled that children and unwitting adults are protected from the content because the website requires a credit card to join, and because software is available by <b>which</b> <b>parents</b> can restrict children's access to Internet pornography. The court did agree with the government that Lawrence had not created a new broad fundamental right to engage in any private sexual conduct. Instead the court relied on Stanley, which had established there was a fundamental right to private possession of obscene material. The court did rely on Lawrence for its assertion that the government could not use public morality as a legitimate state interest which justified the infringement of consensual, adult, private sexual conduct. The court also made reference to the dissenting opinion of Justice Scalia, who said that Lawrence had questioned the validity of U.S. obscenity laws, since the government could not enforce a moral code of conduct. Judge Lancaster also cited numerous constitutional scholars who had observed that the Lawrence ruling calls federal obscenity laws into question.|$|E

500|$|In 1962, {{the book}} was {{published}} in Britain. Siriol Hugh-Jones wrote for The Times Literary Supplement, [...] "The Phantom Tollbooth is something every adult seems sure will turn into a modern Alice... The obvious {{guess is that the}} appeal of this sort of writing is directed towards just the sort of adults who derive a perfectly grown-up pleasure from regularly rereading the Alices. As one might expect, it is illustrated by every grown-up's favourite child-like pictures with the built-in sad sophistication, the work of Jules Feiffer." [...] Jennifer Bourdillon reviewed it for The Listener, [...] "This is the story of an imaginary journey, a sort of Pilgrim's Progress of a little boy in his car... One would hardly have thought from the sound of this that it would have so magnetic an appeal, but the brilliant verbal humour and the weird and wonderful characters (the Dodecahedron. the Watchdog, Faintly Macabre) make it that rare delight, a book <b>which</b> <b>parents</b> and children can share."

2500|$|The term [...] "unschooling" [...] as {{coined by}} John Holt {{describes}} an approach in <b>which</b> <b>parents</b> do not authoritatively direct the child's education, but {{interact with the}} child following the child's own interests, leaving them free to explore and learn as their interests lead. [...] "Unschooling" [...] does not indicate {{that the child is}} not being educated, but that the child is not being [...] "schooled", or educated in a rigid school-type manner. Holt asserted that children learn through the experiences of life, and he encouraged parents to live their lives with their child. Also known as interest-led or child-led learning, unschooling attempts to follow opportunities as they arise in real life, through which a child will learn without coercion. Children at school learn from 1 teacher and 2 auxiliary teachers in a classroom of approximately 30. Kids have the opportunity of dedicated education at home with a ratio of 1 to 1. An unschooled child may utilize texts or classroom instruction, but these are not considered central to education. Holt asserted that there is no specific body of knowledge that is, or should be, required of a child.|$|E
2500|$|Proponents of {{the view}} that PCS has a {{physiological}} basis point to findings that children demonstrate deficits on standardized tests of cognitive function following a mild TBI. A few {{studies have shown that}} people with PCS score lower than controls on neuropsychological tests that measure attention, verbal learning, reasoning, and information processing, but issues related to effort and secondary gain {{can not be ruled out}} as contributing to these differences. [...] Recovery as measured by scores on cognitive tests frequently do not correlate with resolution of symptoms; individuals diagnosed with PCS may still report subjective symptoms after their performance on tests of cognitive functioning have returned to normal. Another study found that although children with PCS had poorer scores on tests of cognitive functioning after the injury, they also had poorer behavioral adjustment before the injury than children with no persistent symptoms; these findings support the idea that PCS may result from a combination of factors such as brain dysfunction resulting from head injury and preexisting psychological or social problems. Different symptoms may be predicted by different factors; for example, one study found that cognitive and physical symptoms were not predicted by the manner in <b>which</b> <b>parents</b> and family members coped with the injury and adjusted to its effects, but psychological and behavioral symptoms were.|$|E

In most areas, families were allowed to apply to have a second child if their first-born is a daughter. Furthermore, families with children with disabilities have different policies and families whose first child suffers from physical disability, mental illness, or intellectual disability were allowed to have more children. However, second children were sometimes subject to birth spacing (usually 3 or 4 years). Children born in overseas countries were not counted under the policy if they do not obtain Chinese citizenship. Chinese citizens returning from abroad were allowed to have a second child.
