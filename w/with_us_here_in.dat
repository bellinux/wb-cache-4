6000|$|On {{this account}} Henchard's manner towards Farfrae insensibly became more reserved. He was courteous--too courteous--and Farfrae was quite {{surprised}} at the good breeding which {{now for the first}} time showed itself among the qualities of a man he had hitherto thought undisciplined, if warm and sincere. The corn-factor seldom or never again put his arm upon the young man's shoulder so as to nearly weigh him down with the pressure of mechanized friendship. He left off coming to Donald's lodgings and shouting into the passage. [...] "Hoy, Farfrae, boy, come and have some dinner <b>with</b> <b>us!</b> Don't sit <b>here</b> <b>in</b> solitary confinement!" [...] But in the daily routine of their business there was little change.|$|R

It {{is not so}} terrible a thing as you imagine: we have long lived under it: and whenever you are disposed {{to know how to}} behave yourself in your new condition, you need go no further than me for a director. But, because we are resolved to go beyond you, we have transmitted a bill to England, to be returned here, giving the Government and six of the Council power for three years to imprison whom they please for three months, without any trial or examination: and I expect to be among the first of those upon whom this law will be executed." ...|$|E

60|$|At about half-past nine George {{escaped from}} his father and {{returned}} to the house. They had been sitting in the balcony which runs round the billiard-room {{on the side of the}} court opposite to the front door. He returned to the house, and caught Marie in one of the passages up-stairs, as she was completing her work for the day. He caught her close to the door of his own room and asked her to come in, that he might speak a word to her. English readers will perhaps remember that among the Vosges mountains there is less of a sense of privacy attached to bedrooms than is the case <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> England. Marie knew immediately then that her cousin had not come to Granpere for nothing,--had not come with the innocent intention of simply pleasing his father,--had not come to say an ordinary word of farewell to her before her marriage. There was to be something of a scene, though she could not tell of what nature the scene might be. She knew, however, that her own conduct had been right; and therefore, though she would have avoided the scene, had it been possible, she would not fear it. She went into his room; and when he closed the door, she smiled, and did not as yet tremble.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{would rather}} not for the moment. But I should like to make you observe that the Boston to be has more to hope and less to fear from the newer Americans than this {{metropolis}} where these {{are so much more}} heterogeneous. Here salvation must be of the Jews among the swarming natives of the East Side; but in Boston {{there is no reason why}} the artistic instincts of the Celtic and Pelasgic successors of the Puritans should not unite in that effect of beauty which is an effect of truth, and keep Boston the first of our cities in good looks as well as good works. <b>With</b> <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> New York a civic job has the chance of turning out a city joy, but it is a fighting chance. In Boston there is little doubt of such a job turning out a joy. The municipality of Boston has had almost the felicity of Goldsmith--it has touched nothing which it has not adorned. Wherever its hand has been laid upon Nature, Nature has purred in responsive beauty. They used to talk about the made land in Boston, but half Boston is the work of man, and it shows what the universe might have been if the Bostonians had been taken into the confidence of the Creator at the beginning. The Back Bay was only the suggestion of what has since been done; and I never go to Boston without some new cause for wonder. There is no other such charming union of pleasaunce and residence as the Fenways; the system of parks is a garden of delight; and now the State has taken up the work, no doubt at the city's suggestion, and, turning from the land to the water, has laid a restraining touch on the tides of the sea, which, ever since the moon entered on their management, have flowed and ebbed through the channel of the Charles. The State has dammed the river; the brine of the ocean no longer enters it, but it feeds itself full of sweet water from the springs in the deep bosom of the country. The Beacon Street houses back upon a steadfast expanse as fresh as the constant floods of the Great Lakes." ...|$|E
5000|$|On September 1st, 2006, {{original}} bassist Hiroyuki Tanaka {{died from}} heart failure. He was 46 years old. Tragedy would strike again in April 2008, {{just two months}} after releasing the album Metal Mad, Loudness went on hiatus when drummer Munetaka Higuchi was diagnosed with liver cancer. They played with Mötley Crüe in October 2008 at the Greater Tokyo Area's Saitama Super Arena, with session drummer Kozo Suganuma (Fragile, Ded Chaplin) filling in for Higuchi. On November 30, 2008 Munetaka died from his illness {{at a hospital in}} Osaka at age 49.In December 2008, the band issued the following statement on their website about the death of original drummer Munetaka Higuchi:"Munetaka Higuchi passed away from liver cancer at a hospital in Osaka city in the morning of 30 November 2008. With permission from his family, we are officially announcing his passing. We realize this announcement came late and we apologize for that. With his and his family's request, a wake and funeral will be held privately. For the press and the fans, we will make sure that you have an opportunity to say your goodbyes to him at later time. For the last eight months since he was diagnosed with liver cancer, he had {{been in and out of}} the hospital several times for the treatment. For the entire time, he was very positive and bravely fighting this disease. He had this strong desire to come back to the stage to play for the fans again. His death came very suddenly and was a very immature one. He lived his life to the fullest as a rock drummer who always gave us hopes and dreams. His heart and soul for music will be succeeded for a long time to come. Munetaka, we are grateful for all your hard work and the great 49 years you lived <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> this world. We would like to express our appreciation for all your condolences sent here for him." ...|$|E
