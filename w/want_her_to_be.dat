500|$|The film's title {{came from}} the song [...] "Naan Paadum Mouna Ragam", from Ratnam's Idaya Kovil (1985). Although he began work on the script while making Pallavi Anu Pallavi, Mouna Ragam did not begin {{production}} until after Idaya Kovil release. Ratnam said that due to budgetary constraints {{it would have been}} easier to send the female lead to Bangalore instead of Delhi, but he did not <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to easily return to her parents because she could not adjust to her husband. The line [...] "Neenga thottaa kambilipoochi oorraa madhri irukku", spoken by Divya to Chandrakumar, expressed how she would feel on her wedding night.|$|E
500|$|Northrup {{went to a}} {{psychiatrist}} to obtain advice about Hubbard's increasingly violent and irrational behaviour, {{and was told that}} he probably needed to be institutionalized and that she was in serious danger. She gave Hubbard an ultimatum: get treatment or she would leave with the baby. He was furious and threatened to kill Alexis rather than let Northrup care for her: [...] "He didn't <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> brought up by me because I was in league with the doctors. He thought I had thrown in with the psychiatrists, with the devils." [...] She left Palm Springs on February 3, leaving Hubbard to complain that Northrup [...] "had hypnotized him in his sleep and commanded him not to write." ...|$|E

500|$|Discussing May's {{sickness}} in {{the episode}} after being [...] "infected" [...] by the ghost Lucy {{in the season}} premiere, Wen explained that [...] "It starts to affect May’s perception of things. It’s almost like being on LSD, but worse. It’s not good. You never want May out of control. You don’t <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> paranoid." [...] Regarding Reyes' choice to work with Johnson {{at the end of}} the episode, Luna said that [...] "a lot of that is I respect her power and I respect her.

500|$|A {{high school}} classmate and love {{interest}} of Parker's, a smart and charismatic {{girl who is}} the chief Intern at Oscorp. For the role, Stone kept her natural blonde hair color, rather than maintaining her usual dyed red hair.

I always assumed that Mary [...] Jane was his first love", and having only been familiar with her The Help co-star Bryce Dallas Howard's portrayal in Spider-Man 3. Stone said, [...] "There's {{a part of me that}} really wants to please people [...] love Spider-Man or Gwen Stacy and <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done justice.

500|$|... "Boyz 4 Now" [...] {{was written}} by Lizzie and Wendy Molyneux and {{directed}} by Anthony Chun. Upon hearing the writers' pitch of the episode, series creator Loren Bouchard found its plot to be [...] "such an immediately appealing story" [...] and [...] "a great way to have Louise peek over {{the other side of}} adolescence and look into the abyss." [...] In an interview with Rolling Stone, Bouchard cited [...] "Boyz 4 Now" [...] as one of his favorite episodes of the series and revealed his liking of [...] "episodes where Louise is a little vulnerable...you don't <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> as invulnerable as she pretends to be. If you try to keep the show grounded, then you periodically have to say, she's a nine-year-old girl." [...] He added that while the character has [...] "an adult sensibility about a lot of stuff," [...] he and the writing staff try to [...] "look for ways to bring her back down to earth," [...] citing the episode's depiction of Louise [...] "fighting against growing up," [...] with Tina acting as [...] "her strange ambassador into that world...in some ways, you couldn't ask for a better guide." ...|$|E

After commenting that America generates better, glossier pop than the British, such as the [...] "holy trinity of 21st century pop music", Christina Aguilera, Britney Spears, and Justin Timberlake, Whitehouse said that the video looked and sounded American, [...] "dripping" [...] with [...] "dollar signs and expensive lenses". The review commending Burke's look in the video calling her, [...] "the gutsier, sassier alternative to the anaemic, high school warbling of, say, Kelly Clarkson or the pre-pubescent offal piped into our children by Miley Cyrus." [...] Whitehouse stated, [...] "It has pomposity, big dance routines, cars built like tanks, moody street hunks (also built like tanks), stunts, jewellery and a rapper, Flo Rida, who in honesty, could have been anyone". He went on to say, [...] "If {{we want to make}} a megastar, let the Americans do it for us. They make megastars.

500|$|Discussing Cordelia's {{relationship}} with Xander, Carpenter says, [...] "A lot of Cordy's conflict, {{and a lot}} of who she is, comes out around Xander. Because she is in love with him in spite of herself, or in spite of him. I have my best moments with [...]" [...] However, her character's growing involvement with Buffy and her friends caused the actress some concern; [...] "I wasn't sure how I felt about it, because I didn't want to lose my edge. I didn't <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> nice; I didn't want her to change because that's who she is." [...] Carpenter's challenge was to find a balance between the good and bad sides of Cordelia, and she explains, [...] "That's why I enjoy playing her so much. She's got to be somewhat tolerable or why would they hang out with her? But I [...] not to lose her edge, her honesty." [...] Carpenter claims that Cordelia's [...] "rough edges" [...] made for difficult experiences with fans, who expected her to be snobby like her character. Charisma continually pleaded to get to slay a vampire, which the writers let her do in her final Buffy appearance, [...] "Graduation Day, Part Two".|$|E

At his suggestion, Lohr contacted the German manufacturers who had supplied U-505s original components and parts, asking for replacements. As the Admiral reported in his autobiography, Eight Bells and All's Well, to his and the museum's surprise, every company supplied the requested parts without charge.

He {{asked her if she}} thought her daughter would <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in so much pain—and Compton said no. [...] "Maybe the betrayal is focusing on the day of her death, rather than celebrating the event of her life," [...] Phil continued. [...] "She lived for 18 vibrant years, and you focus on the day she died." [...] After a moment, Compton uttered her breakthrough sentence: [...] "I never thought of it that way." [...] Later, she sobbed while revealing that she had been planning to end her life after the show. When Compton returned to the show in 2011, she had a new viewpoint on the daughter she lost: [...] "She continues to stay alive every time I do something positive."
