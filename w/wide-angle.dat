5|$|Pale Blue Dot, {{which was}} {{taken with the}} narrow-angle camera, was also {{published}} {{as part of a}} composite picture created from a <b>wide-angle</b> camera photograph showing the Sun and the region of space containing the Earth and Venus. The <b>wide-angle</b> image was inset with two narrow-angle pictures: Pale Blue Dot and a similar photograph of Venus. The <b>wide-angle</b> photograph was taken with the darkest filter (a methane absorption band) and the shortest possible exposure (5 milliseconds), to avoid saturating the camera's vidicon tube with scattered sunlight. Even so, the result was a bright burned-out image with multiple reflections from the optics in the camera and the Sun that appears far larger than the actual dimension of the solar disk. The rays around the Sun are a diffraction pattern of the calibration lamp which is mounted in front of the <b>wide-angle</b> lens.|$|E
5|$|The only {{physical}} {{controls on}} the lens are the AF/MF toggle switch and the two rings, controlling the zoom and focus. The lens does not have image stabilization. This is common for <b>wide-angle</b> photography which can be performed well using hand-held techniques. Over the range of focal lengths, the minimum and maximum aperture vary.|$|E
5|$|To {{visually}} {{enhance the}} size of this set, the camera was equipped with a 40mm Panavision <b>wide-angle</b> lens and mounted {{at the opposite end of}} the stage, giving Crosby the ability to frame the scenes in his camera with extra space at the bottom and at either side. These areas were filled in later by printing-in process extensions of the set, doubling its size onscreen.|$|E
5|$|Film noir is {{also known}} for its use of low-angle, <b>wide-angle,</b> and skewed, or Dutch angle shots. Other devices of {{disorientation}} relatively common in film noir include shots of people reflected {{in one or more}} mirrors, shots through curved or frosted glass or other distorting objects (such as during the strangulation scene in Strangers on a Train), and special effects sequences of a sometimes bizarre nature. Night-for-night shooting, as opposed to the Hollywood norm of day-for-night, was often employed. From the mid-1940s forward, location shooting became increasingly frequent in noir.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Lotterby {{returned}} to the show {{at the insistence of}} Brian Wilde, who preferred Lotterby's use of tight shots focused on the trio as they talked rather than Bell's <b>wide-angle</b> scenes. Lotterby produced and directed one additional series before departing again the same year. Bell then {{returned to}} the show beginning with the 1983 Christmas special and produced and directed all episodes of the show {{to the end of the}} 31st series.|$|E
5|$|The lens {{exhibits}} significant distortion {{in keeping}} with the problems of <b>wide-angle</b> lenses. The complex barrel distortion is approximately 2.9% at 8mm focal length but is fairly insignificant as the focal length is raised above 12mm, according to Photozone.de. PC Magazine reports 3.1% distortion at 8mm and 0.7% at 12mm. It also reports that distortion switches to pincushion distortion of 1.4% at 16mm. SLAR Gear reports that the point of convergence between barrel and pincushion is about 13mm. Foreground subjects seem abnormally large compared to similar background subjects with this lens.|$|E
5|$|The notable {{properties}} of germania (GeO2) are its high {{index of refraction}} and its low optical dispersion. These make it especially useful for <b>wide-angle</b> camera lenses, microscopy, and the core part of optical fibers. It has replaced titania as the dopant for silica fiber, eliminating the subsequent heat treatment that made the fibers brittle. At the end of 2002, the fiber optics industry consumed 60% of the annual germanium use in the United States, but this is less than 10% of worldwide consumption. GeSbTe is a phase change material used for its optic properties, such as that used in rewritable DVDs.|$|E
5|$|Voyager 1s Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS), now disabled, {{consisted}} of two cameras: a 200mm focal length, low-resolution <b>wide-angle</b> camera (WA), used for spatially extended imaging, and a 1500mm high-resolution narrow-angle camera (NA) – the one that took Pale Blue Dot – intended for detailed imaging of specific targets. Both cameras were of the slow-scan vidicon tube type and were fitted with eight colored filters, mounted on a filter wheel {{placed in front of}} the tube.|$|E
5|$|The {{show was}} {{primarily}} filmed using Sony DSR-570 cameras, although special equipment {{was needed for}} some unique footage. For scenes inside the animals' burrows, mini fibre-optic infra-red cameras were employed; <b>wide-angle</b> shots were filmed with a seven-metre crane and a remote-controlled camera platform. An off-camera wireless microphone was also used to record many meerkat vocalizations, only partially audible to cameras' on-board systems. Most filming was done by a single cameraman and a single sound engineer; researchers have required a minimal human presence to avoid stressing the animals. Eye-level shots were difficult to achieve at times, due to the meerkats' small size and the limited height of even the smallest tripods.|$|E
5|$|Being {{designed}} for low-level operations, the Tornado required modification {{to perform in}} medium level operations that the RAF adopted in the 1990s. The RAF's GR1 fleet was extensively re-manufactured as Tornado GR4s. Upgrades on Tornado GR4s included a Forward looking infrared, a <b>wide-angle</b> HUD (Head-up display), improved cockpit displays, NVG (Night vision devices) capabilities, new avionics, and a Global Positioning System receiver. The upgrade eased the integration of new weapons and sensors which were purchased in parallel, including the Storm Shadow cruise missile, the Brimstone anti-tank missile, Paveway III laser-guided bombs and the RAPTOR reconnaissance pod was integrated. The first flight of a Tornado GR4 was on 4 April 1997, on 31 October 1997 the RAF accepted the first delivery and deliveries were completed in 2003. In 2005, the RSAF opted to have their Tornado IDSs undergo a series of upgrades to become equivalent to the RAF's GR4 configuration. On 21 December 2007 BAE signed a £210m contract for CUSP, the Capability Upgrade Strategy (Pilot). This project would see RAF GR4/4A improved in two phases, starting with {{the integration of the}} Paveway IV bomb and a communications upgrade, followed by a new tactical datalink in Phase B.|$|E
5|$|Screenwriter Gidding, who {{had worked}} with {{director}} Wise on the 1958 film I Want to Live!, began a six-month write of the script after reading the book, which Wise had given to him. He perceived the book to be more about mental breakdown than ghosts, and although he was informed after meeting author Shirley Jackson that it was very much a supernatural novel, elements of mental breakdown were introduced into the film. The film was shot at MGM-British Studios in the United Kingdom on a budget of US$1.05 million, with exteriors and the grounds shot at Ettington Park (now the Ettington Park Hotel) in the village of Ettington, Warwickshire. Julie Harris was cast by Wise who found her ideal for the psychologically fragile Eleanor, though during production she suffered from depression and had an uneasy relationship with her co-stars. The interior sets were by Elliot Scott, credited by Wise as instrumental in the making of The Haunting. They were designed to be brightly lit, with no dark corners or recesses, and decorated in a Rococo style; all the rooms had ceilings to create a claustrophobic effect on film. Numerous devices and tricks were used in the filming. Wise used a 30mm anamorphic, <b>wide-angle</b> lens Panavision camera that was not technically ready for use and caused distortions. It was only given to Wise on condition that he sign a memorandum in which he acknowledged that the lens was imperfect. Wise and cinematographer Davis Boulton planned sequences that kept the camera moving, utilizing low-angle takes, and incorporating unusual pans and tracking shots.|$|E

25|$|A {{decorative}} reflecting {{sphere of}} thin metal-coated glass, {{working as a}} reducing <b>wide-angle</b> mirror, is sold as a Christmas ornament called a bauble.|$|E
25|$|Light falloff is also {{sensitive}} to f-stop. Many <b>wide-angle</b> lenses will show a significant light falloff (vignetting) {{at the edges}} for large apertures.|$|E
25|$|<b>Wide-angle</b> tail {{normally}} {{refers to}} a source intermediate between standard FRI and FRII structure, with efficient jets and sometimes hotspots, but with plumes rather than lobes, found {{at or near the}} centres of clusters.|$|E
25|$|The {{posterior}} lateral eyes (PLE) are <b>wide-angle</b> motion detectors which sense motions {{from the}} side and behind. Combined with the other eyes, it gives the spider a near 360-degree view of the world.|$|E
25|$|OSIRIS (Optical, Spectroscopic, and Infrared Remote Imaging System). The {{camera system}} has a narrow-angle lens (700mm) and a <b>wide-angle</b> lens (140mm), with a 2048×2048 pixel CCD chip. The {{instrument}} {{was constructed in}} Germany.|$|E
25|$|While {{the crop}} factor of APS-C cameras {{effectively}} narrows {{the angle of}} view of long-focus (telephoto) lenses, {{making it easier to}} take close-up images of distant objects, <b>wide-angle</b> lenses suffer a reduction in their angle of view by the same factor.|$|E
25|$|To {{the south}} of Epsilon Cygni is the Veil Nebula (NGC 6960, 6962, 6979, 6992, and 6995), a 5,000-year-old {{supernova}} remnant covering approximately 3 degrees of the sky - it is over 50 light-years long. Because of its appearance, it is also called the Cygnus Loop. The Loop is only visible in long-exposure astrophotographs. However, the brightest portion, NGC 6992, is faintly visible in binoculars, and a dimmer portion, NGC 6960, is visible in <b>wide-angle</b> telescopes.|$|E
25|$|The film {{received}} {{a budget of}} $25 million at first, but its final budget was about $30 million. For The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, Gilliam and his cinematographer Nicola Pecorini went wider than ever before on focal length with a new 8mm Zeiss lens, unusual even for a Gilliam movie which are usually trademarked by <b>wide-angle</b> imagery. The widest lens that had been employed before on a Gilliam film had been a 9.8mm Kinoptic. Production of the remaining computer generated imagery effects shots were carried out in Vancouver.|$|E
25|$|The Imaging Science Subsystem, {{made up of}} a {{wide angle}} and a narrow angle camera, is a {{modified}} version of the slow scan vidicon camera designs that were used in the earlier Mariner flights. The Imaging Science Subsystem consists of two television-type cameras, each with eight filters in a commandable filter wheel mounted in front of the vidicons. One has a low resolution 200mm focal length <b>wide-angle</b> lens with an aperture of f/3 (the wide angle camera), while the other uses a higher resolution 1500mm narrow-angle f/8.5 lens (the narrow angle camera).|$|E
25|$|Shadows on the Moon are {{complicated}} by reflected light, uneven ground, <b>wide-angle</b> lens distortion, and lunar dust. There are several light sources: the Sun, sunlight reflected from the Earth, sunlight reflected from the Moon's surface, and sunlight reflected from the astronauts and the Lunar Module. Light from these sources is scattered by lunar dust in many directions, including into shadows. Shadows falling into craters and hills may appear longer, shorter and distorted. Furthermore, shadows display {{the properties of}} vanishing point perspective, leading them to converge to a point on the horizon.|$|E
25|$|The {{refractive}} index (1.7) and optical dispersion properties of germanium dioxide makes it useful as an optical material for <b>wide-angle</b> lenses, in optical microscope objective lenses, {{and for the}} core of fiber-optic lines. See Optical fiber for specifics on the manufacturing process. Both Germanium and its glass oxide, GeO2 are transparent to the infrared spectrum. The glass can be manufactured into IR windows and lenses, used for night-vision technology in the military, luxury vehicles, and Thermographic cameras. GeO2 is preferred over other IR transparent glasses because it is mechanically strong and therefore preferred for rugged military usage.|$|E
25|$|Linear {{magnification}} M is {{not always}} the most useful measure of magnifying power. For instance, when characterizing a visual telescope or binoculars that produce only a virtual image, one would be more concerned with the angular magnification—which expresses how much larger a distant object appears through the telescope compared to the naked eye. In the case of a camera one would quote the plate scale, which compares the apparent (angular) size of a distant object {{to the size of the}} real image produced at the focus. The plate scale is the reciprocal of the focal length of the camera lens; lenses are categorized as long-focus lenses or <b>wide-angle</b> lenses according to their focal lengths.|$|E
25|$|Each of {{the block}} III Ranger {{spacecraft}} had six cameras on board. The cameras were fundamentally the same with differences in exposure times, fields of view, lenses, and scan rates. The camera system was divided into two channels, P (partial) and F (full). Each channel was self-contained with separate power supplies, timers, and transmitters. The F-channel had two cameras: the <b>wide-angle</b> A-camera and the narrow angle B-camera. The P-channel had four cameras: P1 and P2 (narrow angle) and P3 and P4 (wide angle). The final F-channel image was taken between 2.5 and 5 seconds before impact (altitude about 5km) and the last P-channel image 0.2 to 0.4 seconds before impact (altitude about 600 m). The images provided better resolution than was available from Earth-based views {{by a factor of}} 1000.|$|E
25|$|Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS): The ISS is {{a remote}} sensing {{instrument}} that captures most images in visible light, {{and also some}} infrared images and ultraviolet images. The ISS has taken {{hundreds of thousands of}} images of Saturn, its rings, and its moons. The ISS has a <b>wide-angle</b> camera (WAC) that takes pictures of large areas, and a narrow-angle camera (NAC) that takes pictures of small areas in fine detail. Each of these cameras uses a sensitive charge-coupled device (CCD) as its electromagnetic wave detector. Each CCD has a 1,024 square array of pixels, 12μm on a side. Both cameras allow for many data collection modes, including on-chip data compression. Both cameras are fitted with spectral filters that rotate on a wheel—to view different bands within the electromagnetic spectrum ranging from 0.2 to 1.1μm.|$|E
25|$|All-round pilot {{vision was}} {{provided}} by a wrap-around windshield and bubble canopy. Unlike the F-16's steeply raked seat and sidestick controller, however, the Lavi employed a conventional upright seat and central control column. The cockpit employed HOTAS (hands-on-throttle and stick) controls, while a Hughes Aircraft <b>wide-angle</b> diffractive optics head up display (HUD) was integrated onto a single El-Op up-front control panel. There were {{a total of three}} conventional display units, two of which were color. Display redundancy was ensured via data-sharing between the HMDs. A fully computerised Elta ARC-740 ultra high frequency (UHF) radio was incorporated along with a navigation suite, the latter of which included the Tuman TINS 1700 advanced inertial navigation system. Aspects such as flexibility and situational awareness were emphasized to reduce pilot workload while under high g-forces and within a dense threat environment.|$|E
25|$|Xbox One {{consoles}} {{ship with}} {{an updated version}} of Kinect; the new Kinect uses a <b>wide-angle</b> time-of-flight camera, and processes 2 gigabits of data per second to read its environment. The new Kinect has greater accuracy with three times the fidelity over its predecessor and can track without visible light by using an active IR sensor. It has a 60% wider field of vision that can detect a user up to 3 feet from the sensor, compared to six feet for the original Kinect, and can track up to 6 skeletons at once. It can also detect a player's heart rate, facial expression, the position and orientation of 25 individual joints (including thumbs), the weight put on each limb, speed of player movements, and track gestures performed with a standard controller. The color camera captures 1080p video that can be displayed in the same resolution as the viewing screen, allowing for a broad range of scenarios. In addition to improving video communications and video analytics applications, this provides a stable input on which to build interactive applications. Kinect's microphone is used to provide voice commands for actions such as navigation, starting games, and waking the console from sleep mode.|$|E
25|$|The third-generation RX comes {{standard}} with a twin-chamber {{front passenger}} airbags, side torso airbags {{for the front}} row, side curtain airbags for front and rear rows, and knee airbags for the front row. Active headrests become standard to help reduce whiplash injuries. Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) and Hill Assist Control (HAC) which helps prevent the vehicle from rolling backwards on inclines are standard while a more advanced Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management (VDIM) system is optional. VDIM {{is designed to be}} more subtle and less intrusive in performance than VSC alone, VDIM can also engage prior to an actual skid taking place acting as a preventative measure. The Adaptive Front-lighting System (AFS) remains optional, while a new bi-xenon optional Intelligent Highbeam feature is added, this system can dim the high-beams automatically whenever traffic is detected. Other optional safety features include a Pre-Collision System (PCS) and a Head-up Display (HUD) which helps the driver keep attention on the road ahead by displaying navigation, speed, and audio information on the windshield; the HUD uses high-intensity LEDs displaying high contrast white figures on the windshield allowing it to be read in direct sunlight. The optional navigation system offers a backup camera and a Wide-View Side Monitor utilizes a camera on the passenger side view mirror to help eliminate blind spots on the passenger side at low speeds, this system does not include the 180° <b>wide-angle</b> front camera found in the LX 570. To further help improve visibility, water-repellent glass is used on the front doors.|$|E
500|$|The {{aperture}} stop-down focal lengths {{make the}} lens a laggard among <b>wide-angle</b> lenses. [...] Thus, {{it is not}} strong at gathering light for stop action photography. [...] However, DSLR cameras have improved at higher ISO settings. However, <b>wide-angle</b> photography (below 16mm) continues to need stronger lighting than is possible by built in flashes if {{trying to make up}} for low light situations.|$|E

500|$|The lens {{measures}} [...] {{and weighs}} [...] It has a bulb-like aspherical lens, similar to notable <b>wide-angle</b> and fisheye lenses {{such as the}} Nikon AF-S NIKKOR 14-24mm f/2.8G ED, Nikon AF DX Fisheye-Nikkor 10.5mm f/2.8G ED, or Tokina AT-X 107 DX AF 10-17mm f/3.5-4.5 fisheye lens. Because of the shape of front element, it is not compatible with many filters, including UV filters, but the frontal exposure is rectified by a petal-shaped lens hood element. Because the lens has a permanent lens hood affixed, {{it comes with a}} friction-fit aluminum element, variously described as a sleeve, ring or shroud, that surrounds the hood to enable the placement of a front cap on the lens. PC Magazine Jim Fisher says the lens is relatively large and heavy; A reviewer at photozone.de says that for a <b>wide-angle</b> lens the dimensions are unusually narrow but long.|$|E

Gilroy {{believes}} that, in contrast to desaturated, man-made feel {{that the city is}} often depicted as, Los Angeles is a [...] "landscape of primal struggle and survival". Gyllenhaal's animalistic approach to the script influenced this belief, and the idea was to film Nightcrawler like a wildlife documentary. To achieve this goal, Elswit used <b>wide-angle</b> lens, depth of field, and avoided soft focus to bring a sense of landscape.|$|E
500|$|The lens is {{the first}} that {{incorporated}} Sigma's FLD glass elements, designed to correct color aberrations like fluoride glass does. [...] Chromatic aberrations are indeed superior to earlier Sigma <b>wide-angle</b> lenses. In fact, although they might be noticeable at 100% image magnification, they are not at the magnifications now common with prints relative {{to the number of}} megapixels that images are commonly captured at. According to Sigma's website, Super Multi-Layer Coating reduces flare and ghosting. As one zooms out with this lens chromatic aberration becomes significant at the corners.|$|E

500|$|Sednaoui {{experimented with}} a variety of {{cinematography}} techniques including <b>wide-angle</b> lenses, shots from below the subjects, superimposition, vertically cut screens displaying different angles of the same shot, reverse film effects, multiple lighting situations and flashy clothing to convey his concept. Frusciante noted the feeling of the video to be extremely vibrant and over the top: [...] "When it was us just painting ourselves silver and wearing these big silver boots and stuff, I mean it felt like glam rock or something." [...] The video begins with a <b>wide-angle</b> shot of Flea in a desert setting wearing pants with several gold colored horns protruding from each leg. The bassist is standing in a meditative stance and brings his arms together above his head when the music begins to play. The video then transitions between a variety of shots edited together that consist of the four band members standing with their eyes closed; the band dancing around in a dimly lit setting; a ground view of Frusciante playing a reflective silver Fender Stratocaster in between his legs while wearing pants made up entirely of small pieces of mirror; the band members moving around with full makeup on; and the band members dancing frenziedly. Kiedis adopted a deliberately outlandish wardrobe which incorporated gold lipstick, thinly braided hair, revealing meshed shorts and bright silver boots.|$|E
