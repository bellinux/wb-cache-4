The Supreme Court, like many state supreme courts, was a minor organ of government. In his 34-year tenure, Marshall gave it the energy, weight, and dignity of what many <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>is</b> a third co-equal branch of the U.S. government. With his associate justices, especially Joseph Story, William Johnson, and Bushrod Washington, Marshall's Court brought to life the constitutional standards of the new nation.|$|E
25|$|After Wyatt's death, Josephine {{collaborated with}} two of her husband's cousins, Mabel Earp Cason and her sister Vinolia Earp Ackerman, to {{document}} her life. The cousins recorded events in her later life, but they found Josephine evasive about the timing and nature of events during her time in the Arizona Territory and Tombstone. She would not even talk about the key events of 1881-82, their key years in Tombstone. The most she <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>is</b> that {{she returned to the}} Arizona Territory in 1881 and joined Johnny Behan in Tombstone. She said that she had believed Behan was planning to marry her, but he kept putting it off, and she grew disillusioned.|$|E

He said, [...] "I've seen the video [...] It's like a thing she has, you know, that I guess people <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>is</b> like a charisma kinda thing that it zooms, you know, comes up. It's beautiful [...] It's magic, it's spirit." [...] The video aired on MTV on October 10, 1995. According to Marla Shelton, a writer for Camera Obscura, a journal of feminism and film theory, [...] "the video concept's originality stops with Houston's hair style as its stark simplicity underscores the 'straight and narrow' politics of the film." [...] When the film was released, the video was shown as a trailer prior to the beginning of films on 450 General Cinema screens in some major US media markets.|$|E

Kirsty Young, the presenter, suggested that Black was [...] "somebody who might think that a simplistic political soundbite isn't even beginning to address the underlying issues of, culturally, what we're finding such a problem right now".

2500|$|SCO {{executives}} Darl McBride and Blake Stowell also denigrated Jones, {{and claimed}} that she worked for IBM. Jones denied this allegation, as did IBM in a court filing. During an SCO conference call on April 13, 2005, McBride said, [...] "The reality is the web site is full of misinformation, including {{the people who are}} actually running it" [...] when talking about Groklaw, adding also [...] "What I <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>is</b> that it is not what it is purported to be". Later developments in the court cases showed that McBride's statements to the press regarding the SCO litigation had limited credibility; very few such statements were ever substantiated and most were shown to be false. For example, McBride claimed that SCO owned the copyrights to UNIX, and SCO filed suit to try to enforce these claims. The outcome went against McBride's claims. The jury found that SCO had not purchased these copyrights.|$|E

During the interview she criticized Barack Obama for his association with Jeremiah Wright and Bill Ayers, saying [...] "...usually we associate with people who have similar ideas to us, and it seems that it calls into question what Barack Obama's true beliefs, and values, and thoughts are... I am very concerned that he [...] may have anti-American views." [...] She noted the bombing campaign orchestrated by Bill Ayers before discussing his association with Barack Obama, arguing that [...] "Bill Ayers is not someone the average American wants to see their president have an association with." [...] Matthews followed up by asking [...] "But he [...] is a Senator from the State of Illinois; he's {{one of the members of}} Congress you suspect of being anti-American. How many people in the Congress of the United States do you think are anti-American? You've already suspected Barack Obama, is he alone or are there others?"
