I have no fear of making changes, {{destroying}} the image, etc., because the painting has {{a life of its}} own. I try to let it come through. It is only when I lose contact with the painting that the result is a mess. Otherwise there is pure harmony, an easy give and take, and the painting comes out well.|$|E
500|$|Bosi {{completed}} the deal in June 2007 {{for a new}} site at 29 Maddox Street in London. He intended for the new Hibiscus to be open by September, and to transfer over the style of cooking he had used in Ludlow, saying, [...] "I'm transferring Hibiscus, not starting a new restaurant. The idea is to continue and build on <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> doing." [...] Purchasing and fitting out the London premises cost around £1 million.|$|E
500|$|Stanley was a {{powerful}} orator who used dramatic flourishes to emphasize his points. He would often loosen his tie before he ever started speaking, {{and by the end}} of his speech have thrown off his vest and coat. In one instance, the candidates debated a tax on dog owners of one dollar per dog. Stanley favored the tax, while Morrow contended that everyone should be allowed one dog tax-free. Stanley ridiculed the idea as [...] "Free Old Dog Ring," [...] and sometimes howled like a dog in speeches deriding the proposal. On another occasion Stanley, who had too much to drink, vomited in front of the audience as Morrow spoke. When Stanley took the podium, he remarked, [...] "That just goes to show you <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> saying all over Kentucky. Ed Morrow plain makes me sick to my stomach." ...|$|E

500|$|Give Me My Remote writer Kath Skerry {{liked the}} cast's scenes with the sumo suits, but saved {{most of her}} praise for Pam's speech. She {{declared}} that it [...] "was AMAZING. Jenna Fischer blew me away with that speech. It’s <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> hoping for since the first episode of this season. It didn’t end with Jim swooping in and kissing Pam but there’s still one episode left in the season. So that’s {{what we have to}} ponder over the next week." [...] Jay Black of AOLTV also enjoyed the episode. He wrote, [...] "I thought that it was a bit more low key than some of the previous episodes (hilarious sumo outfits not withstanding) and that suited me just fine. I thought that Michael's ridiculousness, always a difficult balancing act, was reigned-in to just this side of believable where it belongs. I thought that it was filled with a great assortment of gags, both character-based and farcical." [...] However, Black was critical of Pam's speech because it felt both [...] "forced" [...] and out of character for Pam to publicly state her feelings.|$|E
2500|$|Near {{the end of}} {{his life}} Barlow was quoted in the Manchester Guardian: [...] "I don't think any cricketer has enjoyed his cricketing career better than I have done, and if I had my time to come over again I should {{certainly}} be <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> all my life – a professional cricketer".|$|E

2500|$|Nogradi won the Janikovszky-Eva {{award in}} 2003, {{but he has}} never {{received}} any national awards. As he says, [...] "They look at me as an outsider, {{because the people who}} give the awards in our country do not fully understand <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> trying to accomplish with my work and my projects. Fortunately, my readers, the children (and their parents) do, so as long as they love and read my books, I am happy. As a famous Hungarian poet, Sandor Weöres, once said, a writer, if he is any good, must live a sort of life that the powers that be do not even consider him for an award.... I agree." ...|$|E

Anabela {{plays the role}} of Anita, the sensual and confident woman whose boyfriend {{is the leader of the}} Sharks, a gang composed by the first generation of Americans from Puerto Rico. Again, her part is performed in turns with Lúcia Moniz. Talking about her character, Anabela confessed it is her [...] "career's greatest challenge. Completely different from <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> doing so far." [...] She further explains that [...] "the attitude, poise and voice are very distinct from mine and clash with the roles of young innocent girl that I am used to performing." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wright later {{claimed that}} his {{decision}} to join the YCV had {{been influenced by the}} Kingsmill massacre of January 1976, when ten local Protestant civilians were killed by republicans. Wright's cousin Jim Wright, future father-in-law Billy Corrigan, and brother-in-law Leslie Corrigan, were also killed by republicans in this period. Wright later said of the Kingsmill massacre, [...] "I was 15 when those workmen were pulled out of that bus and shot dead. I was a Protestant and I realised that they had been killed simply because they were Protestants. I left Mountnorris, came back to Portadown and immediately joined the youth wing of the UVF. I felt it was my duty to help my people and that is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> doing ever since." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 21st century, Rawat {{gave some}} TV-interviews. Rawat made the {{following}} {{comments on the}} subject of criticism during an interview on a Taiwan News channel in June 2014, [...] "So far I’m concerned, my focus in life is not to appease critics, but is to bring the message of peace to people. [...] When you’ve been doing <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> doing for 5 decades plus, yes you’re gonna get critics. [...] People said, [...] "He’s going to fade away." [...] Well, how about fifty-two years. And I’m still doing strong, because it is about my conviction. And my conviction is [...] "peace is possible". And I will do everything that I must do, because it’s important to me that people find that peace in their life." ...|$|E
2500|$|The filmmakers {{obscured}} the explicitly Biblical {{character of the}} Authority to avoid offending viewers. Weitz declared {{that he would not}} do the same for the planned sequels. [...] "Whereas The Golden Compass had to be introduced to the public carefully", he said, [...] "the religious themes {{in the second and third}} books can't be minimised without destroying the spirit of these books. ...I will not be involved with any 'watering down' of books two and three, since <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> working towards the whole time in the first film is to be able to deliver on the second and third". In May 2006, Pullman said of a version of the script that [...] "all the important scenes are there and will have their full value"; in March 2008, he said of the finished film that [...] "a lot of things about it were good.... Nothing can bring out all that's in the book. There are always compromises".|$|E
60|$|This {{was really}} such a {{confusing}} question that Ada {{looked at me}} in perfect dismay. As to the guilty nature of my own consciousness after <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> thinking, it must <b>have</b> <b>been</b> expressed in the colour of my cheeks.|$|R

2500|$|Mohamed ElBaradei, former {{director}} general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, wrote that [...] "the only way to resolve the Iranian issue is to build trust. Moving 1200, half, or at least {{more than half of the}} Iranian nuclear material out of Iran is a confidence-building measure would defuse the crisis and enable the US and the West [...] the space to negotiate. I hope that it would be perceived as a win-win situation. If we see <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> observing in the last couple of days that it is an [...] "empty dressing", I think it is a wrong approach...we lost six years of failed policy frankly vis-à-vis Iran. And it's about time now to understand that the Iranian issue is not going to be resolved except, until and unless we sit with the Iranians and try to find a fair and equitable solution." [...] "If this deal is followed up with a broader engagement of the IAEA and the international community, it can be a positive step to a negotiated settlement," [...] UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon said.|$|E
2500|$|The visa {{program was}} {{suspended}} on September 3, 1940, and officially ended on November 20, 1941. The Spanish and Portuguese governments had already refused to issue travel visas for those using the immigration visas to Brazil. [...] Innitzer updated the Vatican {{again on the}} increased pace of the deportations on May 20, 1942, and the Vatican tried {{for the last time}} to appeal to the Brazilians in July 1942. Maglione wrote in December 1941 to the bishop whose request had initiated the project that: [...] "as you have certainly been informed [...] many emigrants have departed andI regret to sayfrom <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> told, a good many of them, both by their improper conduct and alleged demands, have not corresponded to the concern which the Holy See has shown in their behalf". The emphasis of Maglione's letter was not on the failure of a diplomatic effort, but chagrin at the alleged conduct and lack of gratitude of the recipients of the visas. According to the Encyclopedia of the Holocaust, by [...] "improper conduct", Maglione could only have meant that the recipients continued to practice Judaism.|$|E
2500|$|The {{personal}} and vocational {{experiences of the}} four co-writers were central to writing the script. Dinelaris' exposure to Broadway shaped the depictions of rehearsals and events backstage, though he admitted exaggerating these. He also felt his background writing long scenes of dialogue helped since scenes in the film [...] "were really more like play scenes". Iñárritu's own experiences influenced many of Birdmans themes. [...] "What this film talks about, I have been through," [...] Iñárritu recalled. [...] "I have seen and experienced all of it; it's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> living through {{the last years of}} my life." [...] Dinelaris described this aspect as [...] "a laughing look at oneself", but said {{it had to be done}} in a comedic way otherwise [...] "it would have been the most unbelievably self-absorbed look at the subject". Themes from Raymond Carver's short story [...] "What We Talk About When We Talk About Love", which Riggan adapts for stage in the story, also influenced the script. Iñárritu wanted to find the connection between the themes in Riggan's story and those of Carver's. Because of this, it was important to the director that Carver's story be the subject of the play depicted within the film. Therefore, Iñárritu stated that his desire to use Carver's work was [...] "terrifying" [...] because the rights to using the Carver material were still subject to the possibility of being rejected during development of the film, but no issues arose. Carver's widow, writer Tess Gallagher, loved the script and permitted the adaptation, saying that Carver would be laughing about the film.|$|E
