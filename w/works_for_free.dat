30|$|Recently, my close friend, Farhad Naini (London, UK), {{published}} a textbook entitled “Orthognathic Surgery: Principles, Planning and Practice” [1]. Though {{there have been}} many textbooks for orthognathic surgery, this textbook is unique. There are 61 chapters and 95 contributing authors. The book begins with a wonderful introductory chapter on the historical background of orthognathic surgery written by the father of modern orthognathic surgery, Prof. Hugo Obwegeser. As Dr Naini is an orthodontist, he has included many chapters on pre-operative and post-operative orthodontic consideration for orthognathic surgery. The details about surgical technique are also covered in detail. This book should be added to the catalogue of must-read books for both oral and maxillofacial surgeons and orthodontists. In addition, Dr Naini has published very interesting articles in Maxillofacial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery [2, 3]. As Maxillofacial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery is an open access journal, you can read Dr Naini’s recent <b>works</b> <b>for</b> <b>free.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Screenwriting is a {{freelance}} profession. No education is required to become a professional screenwriter, just good storytelling abilities and imagination. Screenwriters are not hired employees but contracted freelancers. Most, if not all, screenwriters start their careers writing on speculation (spec) and so write without being hired or paid for it. If such a script is sold, it is called a spec script. What separates a professional screenwriter from an amateur screenwriter is that professional screenwriters are usually represented by a talent agency. Also, professional screenwriters do not often <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>free,</b> but amateur screenwriters will often <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>free</b> and are considered [...] "writers in training." [...] Spec scripts are usually penned by unknown professional screenwriters and amateur screenwriters.|$|R
