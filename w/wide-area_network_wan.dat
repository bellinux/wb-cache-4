50|$|Optical {{networking}} is a {{means of}} communication that uses signals encoded onto light to transmit information among various nodes of a telecommunications network. They operate from the limited range of a local-area network (LAN) or over a <b>wide-area</b> <b>network</b> (<b>WAN),</b> which can cross metropolitan and regional areas all the way to national, international and transoceanic distances. It is a form of optical communication that relies on optical amplifiers, lasers or LEDs and wave division multiplexing (WDM) to transmit large quantities of data, generally across fiber-optic cables. Because it is capable of achieving extremely high bandwidth, it is an enabling technology for today’s Internet and the communication networks that transmit the vast majority of all human and machine-to-machine information.|$|E

5000|$|The merger gave Madge {{the ability}} to combine the rival {{networking}} technologies into hybrid systems {{and the capacity to}} bridge the company's products into the latest networking technology, ATM, or asynchronous transfer mode. By the mid-1990s companies were straining the limits of the existing networking technologies. As corporations joined more and more of their work force to the company network, their networks quickly ran short of bandwidth for transmitting data. The arrival of new networking applications - in particular, video conferencing and video data transfers, not only pushed bandwidth needs to the extreme, but threatened to cripple networks entirely. ATM's more efficient use of packet technology offered the prospective of dramatic bandwidth gains. Adoption of the technology would require corporations to rebuild their networking infrastructure, and Madge Networks readied not only its own ATM products, but also the hubs and switches needed to bridge existing Token Ring and Ethernet equipment to the new technology. The Lannet merger enhanced Madge's portfolio of LAN switches, needed to connect Ethernet and Token Ring stations to corporate ATM installations.An important consideration is that Madge focussed on ATM as a Local Area Network (LAN) technology, and not as a carrier backbone <b>Wide-Area</b> <b>Network</b> (<b>WAN)</b> solution. In fact, Madge bet on ATM replacing not just Token-Ring and Ethernet, but even TCP/IP as THE desktop PC and laptop networking technology. This proved to be a costly mistake, when enterprise customers did not adopt ATM, opting to go to switched Ethernet instead. The company's ATM products were mostly unsuitable for the Carrier market, and so most of the company's investment in future products did not produce any returns. This wrong market/technology focus was a large factor in Madge's eventual failure.|$|E
40|$|This note {{addresses}} {{the question of}} whether self-similar processes are sufficient to model packet network traffic, or whether a broader class of multifractal processes is needed.

It is also used in adaptive application resource remapping [35]. It is a very useful technique in cluster and cloud environment. It has many benefits like load balancing, energy saving, preserving service availability. It also avoids process level problem such as residual dependencies [33], process dependency on its original (source) node.

40|$|Abstract — Virtually all network {{applications}} requiring reliable end-toend communication {{depend on}} TCP. Unfortunately, {{the performance of}} any stock TCP is abysmal over <b>wide-area</b> <b>networks</b> (<b>WANs)</b> and even over localarea networks (LANs) with very high-bandwidth links. Currently, network researchers manually optimize TCP buffer sizes to achieve acceptable performance over a given connection. Unfortunately, this manual optimization requires changes to the kernel on both end hosts involved in the network connection (changes that are only effective for connections between these two hosts). Furthermore, because two administrative domains must be coordinated to perform this optimization, this process can be tedious and time consuming. To address these problems, this paper illustrates {{the benefits of a}} new technique called dynamic right-sizing. This technique dynamically and automatically determines the best buffer size, and hence flow-control window size in TCP. Our simulation study shows that dynamic right-sizing can improve the performance of flows by two orders of magnitude over stock TCP implementations that have static flow-control windows...|$|R

While a few utilities in Texas presently employ synchrophasors in their service territories to increase overall service reliability, many challenges have prevented the development of a large-scale synchrophasor measurement network spanning the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) interconnection. New comprehensive analyses of data gathered from measurement units strategically placed throughout ERCOT will ultimately allow these utilities to make more informed control decisions. This paper discusses the ongoing development of a synchrophasor network by the University of Texas and the network applications, including modal analysis of measured angle differences between measurement locations. Understanding how high penetration levels of wind generation in West Texas affect overall system stability is of key interest.
