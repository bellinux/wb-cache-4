The intelligentsia should be aware of this. And it is the intelligentsia specifically that should keep this in mind and prevent society from radical steps and revolutions of all kinds. We’ve had enough of it. We’ve seen so many revolutions and wars. We need decades of calm and harmonious development.|$|E
500|$|A French battery {{advanced}} to within 300 {{yards of the}} 1/1st Nassau square causing heavy casualties. When the Nassauers attempted to attack the battery they were ridden down by a squadron of cuirassiers [...] Yet another battery deployed on the flank of Mercer's battery and shot up its horses and limbers and pushed Mercer back. Mercer later recalled, [...] "The rapidity and precision of this fire was quite appaling. Every shot almost took effect, and I certainly expected <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> annihilated. ... The saddle-bags, in many instances were torn from horses' backs ... One shell I saw explode under the two finest wheel-horses in the troop down they dropped".|$|E

In the foreword to the book The Auschwitz Volunteer: Beyond Bravery, Michael Schudrich, the Chief Rabbi of Poland, wrote as follows: [...] "When God created the human being, God had in mind that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> like Captain Witold Pilecki, of blessed memory." [...] In the introduction to that book Norman Davies, a British historian, wrote: [...] "If there was an Allied hero who deserved to be remembered and celebrated, this was a person with few peers." [...] At the commemoration event of International Holocaust Remembrance Day held in the US Holocaust Memorial Museum on 27 January 2013 Ryszard Schnepf, the Polish Ambassador to the US, described Pilecki as a [...] "diamond among Poland's heroes" [...] and [...] "the highest example of Polish patriotism".|$|E

In late 2002, Bruno finally gave in; the bill passed the Senate and was signed into law by Pataki. Bruno also admitted in the spring of 2009 (while out-of-power and facing trial on corruption charges) that he personally favored same-sex marriage but never brought it the floor of the State Senate because the majority of his conference was against it, stating [...] "This is America, and we have inalienable rights... Life is short, and <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> afforded the same opportunities and rights to enjoy it." ...|$|E

2500|$|In March 1943, Royal Air Force Squadron Leader Roger Bushell {{conceived}} a {{plan for}} a mass escape from the North Compound, which occurred on the night of 24/25 March 1944. He was being held with the other British and Commonwealth airmen and he was in command of the Escape Committee that managed all escape opportunities from the north compound. Falling back on his legal background to represent his scheme, Bushell called a meeting of the Escape Committee to advocate for his plan. He said: [...] "Everyone here in this room is living on borrowed time. By rights <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> dead! The only reason that God allowed us this extra ration of life is so we can make life hell for the Hun... In North Compound we are concentrating our efforts on completing and escaping through one master tunnel. No private-enterprise tunnels allowed. Three bloody deep, bloody long tunnels will be dug – Tom, Dick, and Harry. One will succeed!" ...|$|E

[...] Gingrich also said that the Obama administration had failed to take the Middle East seriously and that Obama's 2009 speech in Cairo designed to improve relations with the Muslim world was a mistake. Gingrich said, [...] "The president went to Cairo and gave his famous speech in which he explained that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> friends together because we're all the same people doing the same things and there are no differences between us. Well, I {{think there are a lot}} of differences between the Muslim Brotherhood and the rest of us." ...|$|E
