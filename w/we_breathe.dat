5|$|Men {{are like}} plants: the {{goodness}} and flavour {{of the fruit}} proceeds from the peculiar soil and exposition in which they grow. We are nothing but what we derive from the air <b>we</b> <b>breathe,</b> the climate we inhabit, the government we obey, the system of religion we profess, {{and the nature of}} our employment.|$|E
25|$|Human {{physiology}} {{is adapted}} to living within the atmosphere of Earth, and {{a certain amount of}} oxygen is required in the air <b>we</b> <b>breathe.</b> The minimum concentration, or partial pressure, of oxygen that can be tolerated is 16 kPa (0.16 bar). Below this, the astronaut is at risk of becoming unconscious and dying from hypoxia. In the vacuum of space, gas exchange in the lungs continues as normal but results in the removal of all gases, including oxygen, from the bloodstream. After 9 to 12 seconds, the deoxygenated blood reaches the brain, and it results in the loss of consciousness. Death would gradually follow after two minutes of exposure—though the absolute limits are uncertain.|$|E
500|$|Along with Pierce Brosnan, Cindy Crawford, Jane Seymour, Dick Van Dyke, Téa Leoni, and Daryl Hannah, Berry {{successfully}} {{fought in}} 2006 against the Cabrillo Port Liquefied Natural Gas facility that was proposed {{off the coast}} of Malibu. Berry said, [...] "I care about the air <b>we</b> <b>breathe,</b> I care about the marine life and the ecosystem of the ocean." [...] In May 2007, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed the facility. Hasty Pudding Theatricals gave her its 2006 Woman of The Year award. Berry took part in a nearly 2,000-house cell-phone bank campaign for Barack Obama in February 2008. In April 2013, she appeared in a video clip for Gucci's [...] "Chime for Change" [...] campaign that aims to raise funds and awareness of women's issues in terms of education, health, and justice. In August 2013, Berry testified alongside Jennifer Garner before the California State Assembly's Judiciary Committee in support of a bill that would protect celebrities' children from harassment by photographers. The bill passed in September.|$|E

2500|$|Regarding {{spirituality and}} its {{relationship}} with science, Sagan stated: 'Spirit' comes from the Latin word 'to breathe'. What <b>we</b> <b>breathe</b> is air, which is certainly matter, however thin. Despite usage to the contrary, there is no necessary implication in the word 'spiritual' {{that we are talking}} of anything other than matter (including the matter of which the brain is made), or anything ...|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the death}} of the Marquis de Montcalm and the fall of Québec on 18 September – after the colonel's aborted attempt to {{resupply}} the besieged city – Bougainville was dispatched to the western front by his new commanding officer, the Chevalier de Lévis. He attempted to stop the British advance from his entrenchments at Île-aux-Noix. He was among the officers who accompanied Lévis to Saint Helen's Island off Montreal for the last French stand in North America before the general capitulation of 1761. Of the war, Bougainville wrote in his journal: [...] "It is an abominable kind of war. The very air <b>we</b> <b>breathe</b> is contagious of insensibility and hardness".|$|E
2500|$|In {{its first}} press release, Scott Jones, President of Artist View Entertainment stated, [...] "We are {{very pleased to}} be working with Tristan Loraine and his {{powerful}} independent film. The production values and tightly crafted Direction are the key factors in pushing home a frightening message {{for those of us who}} travel by air on a daily basis." [...] Other reviews were also positive about the film, highlighting the importance of the issues for public interest: Ted Jeory, Home Affairs Editor of the , London, wrote, [...] "It's got the lot. A film that has suspense, drama, action, intrepid journalism, and perhaps most importantly–a cause. A Dark Reflection shines a light on aviation's dirty secret: the quality of the air <b>we</b> <b>breathe</b> on board planes. It's an important step in the decades long challenge to Big Oil and Big Aviation." [...] Ross Coulthart of Sunday Night on Channel 7, Sydney, wrote, [...] "A Dark Reflection is a gripping thriller based on the true-life scandal of a major toxic air health problem widespread on modern passenger jets. The most confronting thing about this extraordinary film is that it's all true." ...|$|E

60|$|And {{from the}} same center acts the great {{function}} {{of the heart and}} breath. Ah, the aspiration, the aspiration, like a hope, like a yearning constant and unfailing with which we take in breath. When <b>we</b> <b>breathe,</b> when we take in breath, it is not as when we take in food. When <b>we</b> <b>breathe</b> in we aspire, we yearn towards the heaven of air and light. And when the heart dilates to draw in the stream of dark blood, it opens its arms as to a beloved. It dilates with reverent joy, as a host opening his doors to an honored guest, whom he delights to serve: opening his doors to the wonder which comes to him from beyond, and without which he were nothing.|$|E

60|$|It {{is not the}} sun {{which we}} see in heaven. It is the rushing thither and the rushing thence of the {{vibrations}} expelled by death {{from the body of}} life, and returned back again to the body of life. Possibly even a dead soul makes its journey to the sun and back, before we receive it again in our breast. Just as the breath <b>we</b> <b>breathe</b> out flies to the sun and back, before <b>we</b> <b>breathe</b> it in again. And as the water that evaporates rises right to the sun, and returns here. What we see is the great golden rushing thither, from the death exhalation, towards the sun, as a great cloud of bees flying to swarm upon the invisible queen, circling round, and loosing again. This is what we see of the sun. The center is invisible for ever.|$|E

One of the key methods that Hanh presents is learning to be aware of breathing.|$|R

But I climbed out just in time. I'd hitched the signallin' lamp to her tail so's we could track her. Otherwise, with my Rush Silencer, we might's well have shooed an owl out of a barn. She left just that way when we let her go. No sound except the propellers--Whoo-oo-oo! Whoo-oo-oo! There was {{a dip in the}} ground ahead. It hid her lamp for a second--but there's no such thing as time in real life. Then that lamp {{travelled}} up the far slope slow--too slow. Then it kinder lifted, we judged. Then it sure was liftin'. Then it lifted good. D'you know why? Our four naked perspirin' souls was out there underneath her, hikin' her heavens high. Yes, sir. We did it!... And that lamp kept liftin' and liftin'. Then she side-slipped! My God, she side-slipped twice, which was what I'd been afraid of all along! Then she straightened up, and went away climbin' to glory, for that blessed star of our hope got smaller and smaller till we couldn't track it any more. Then <b>we</b> <b>breathed.</b> <b>We</b> hadn't <b>breathed</b> any since their arrival, but we didn't know it till <b>we</b> <b>breathed</b> that time--all together.
