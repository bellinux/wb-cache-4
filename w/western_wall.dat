5|$|It is a centuries-old custom for Jews {{to place}} kvitelach {{containing}} personal prayers to God between {{the stones of}} the <b>Western</b> <b>Wall</b> in Jerusalem. This practice has been also adopted by Christian pilgrims and foreign dignitaries as well. More than a million prayer notes are placed in the <b>Western</b> <b>Wall</b> each year.|$|E
5|$|Some medieval rabbis {{claimed that}} today's <b>Western</b> <b>Wall</b> is a {{surviving}} {{wall of the}} Temple itself and cautioned Jews from approaching it, lest they enter the Temple precincts {{in a state of}} impurity. Many contemporary rabbis believe that the rabbinic traditions were made in reference to the Temple Mount's <b>Western</b> <b>Wall,</b> which accordingly endows the Wall with inherent holiness. Most secular scholars believe however that these traditions originally pertained to a <b>western</b> <b>wall</b> of the Temple itself, and since the 1500s, were gradually applied to the surviving retaining <b>Western</b> <b>Wall</b> of the Mount.|$|E
5|$|The kvitelach {{placed in}} the <b>Western</b> <b>Wall</b> differ from the kvitelach given in Hasidic courts, as they contain prayers, {{requests}} or messages written directly to God. These prayer notes are folded and wedged into the cracks and crevices of the Wall. The rationale for this practice has been traced to the Midrashic teaching that the Divine Presence has never moved from the <b>Western</b> <b>Wall,</b> and the Kabbalistic teaching that all prayers ascend to Heaven through the Temple Mount, which the <b>Western</b> <b>Wall</b> abuts. More than a million prayer notes are {{placed in the}} <b>Western</b> <b>Wall</b> each year.|$|E

5|$|The {{location}} of the arch along the <b>western</b> <b>wall</b> of the Temple Mount, yet {{at a distance from}} the <b>Western</b> <b>Wall</b> plaza, has prompted the Israeli Government to allow the area to be used for alternative (non-Orthodox)services.|$|E
5|$|Based on the 11th century French rabbi Rabbeinu Gershom's ban against reading another person's mail, Jewish law forbids {{the reading}} of notes that have been {{inserted}} in the <b>Western</b> <b>Wall.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} of placing prayer {{notes in the}} <b>Western</b> <b>Wall</b> has also been adopted by Christian pilgrims and people of other faiths. Foreign dignitaries who have publicly placed a kvitel in the <b>Western</b> <b>Wall</b> include Pope John Paul II in 2000, U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton in 2005, Pope Benedict XVI in 2008, U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama in 2008, and U.S. presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his wife Ann in 2012. Pope Francis inserted a handwritten Spanish language text of the Lord's Prayer in the Wall during his visit in 2014. On May 22, 2017, Donald Trump became the first sitting U.S. President to visit the Wall; he also inserted a note.|$|E

50|$|Some of the {{original}} fabric {{of the house was}} altered when renovations were carried out in the 1980s. The brickwork on the eastern and <b>western</b> <b>walls,</b> damaged in an earlier storm, was replaced with modern bricks and cement mortar. The brickwork in the gable at the western end of the building was replaced with glass installed between {{the original}} timber members. Windows in the eastern and <b>western</b> <b>walls</b> have been replaced with aluminium-framed windows and new awnings have been constructed over these windows.|$|R
5|$|In 2005, the <b>Western</b> <b>Wall</b> Heritage Foundation {{initiated}} a major renovation effort under Rabbi-of-the-Wall Shmuel Rabinovitch. Its {{goal was to}} renovate and restore the area within Wilson's Arch, the covered area {{to the left of}} worshipers facing the Wall in the open prayer plaza, in order to increase access for visitors and for prayer.|$|E
5|$|In Judaism, the <b>Western</b> <b>Wall</b> is venerated as {{the sole}} remnant of the Holy Temple. It has become a place of pilgrimage for Jews, {{as it is the}} closest {{permitted}} accessible site to the holiest spot in Judaism, namely the Even ha-shetiya or Foundation Stone, which lies on the Temple Mount. According to one rabbinic opinion, Jews may not set foot upon the Temple Mount and doing so is a sin punishable by Kareth. While almost all historians and archaeologists and some rabbinical authorities believe that the rocky outcrop in the Dome of the Rock is the Foundation Stone, some rabbis say it is located directly opposite the exposed section of the <b>Western</b> <b>Wall,</b> near the El-kas fountain. This spot was the site of the Holy of Holies when the Temple stood.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} source mentioning {{this specific}} site {{as a place}} of worship is from the 16th century. The previous sites used by Jews for mourning the destruction of the Temple, during periods when access to the city was prohibited to them, lay to the east, on the Mount of Olives and in the Kidron Valley below it. From the mid-19th century onwards, attempts to purchase rights to the wall and its immediate area were made by various Jews, but none was successful. With the rise of the Zionist movement in the early 20th century, the wall became a source of friction between the Jewish and Muslim communities, the latter being worried that the wall could be used to further Jewish claims to the Temple Mount and thus Jerusalem. During this period outbreaks of violence {{at the foot of the}} wall became commonplace, with a particularly deadly riot in 1929 in which 133 Jews were killed and 339 injured. After the 1948 Arab-Israeli War the Eastern portion of Jerusalem was occupied by Jordan. Under Jordanian control Jews were completely expelled from the Old City including the Jewish quarter, and Jews were barred from entering the Old City for 19 years, effectively banning Jewish prayer at the site of the <b>Western</b> <b>Wall.</b> This period ended on June 10, 1967, when Israel gained control of the site following the Six-Day War. Three days after establishing control over the <b>Western</b> <b>Wall</b> site the Moroccan Quarter was bulldozed by Israeli authorities to create space for what is now the <b>Western</b> <b>Wall</b> plaza.|$|E

Two rivers drain the notch; the Ellis River drains {{the south end}} and is {{a tributary of the}} Saco, and the Peabody River drains the north end and is a tributary of the Androscoggin.|$|E
5|$|According to the Quran and Islamic traditions, al-Aqsa Mosque is {{the place}} from which Muhammad went on a night journey (al-isra) during which he rode on Buraq, who took him from Mecca to al-Aqsa. Muhammad {{tethered}} Buraq to the <b>Western</b> <b>Wall</b> and prayed at al-Aqsa Mosque and after he finished his prayers, the angel Jibril (Gabriel) traveled with him to heaven, where he met several other prophets and led them in prayer.|$|E

50|$|On 20 March 2012, what {{remained}} of the station's façade (the southern and <b>western</b> <b>walls,</b> their windows and doorways bricked up) was demolished. Network Rail cited public safety as the reason, claiming the façade had become unsafe after sustaining storm damage.|$|R
50|$|As Saturno, Stuart and Taube have argued, {{the murals}} on the {{northern}} and <b>western</b> <b>walls</b> of the chamber {{in the base of}} the temple pyramid ('Pinturas Sub-1') depict elements of Maya creation mythology reminiscent of the Popol Vuh as well as of Yucatec cosmological traditions.|$|R
5|$|Although Herod's {{renovation}} of the Second Temple was initiated in late 1st century BCE, excavations beneath the street near the arch revealed three oil lamps of a type common {{in the first century}} CE and 17 identifiable coins, several of which were struck by Valerius Gratus, Roman procurator of Judea, in the year 17/18 CE. This means that the arch and nearby sections of the <b>Western</b> <b>Wall</b> were constructed after this date.|$|E
5|$|As constructed, {{the main}} {{facade of the}} station faced Glenwood Avenue. The two-story {{entrance}} loggia consisted of seven arched bays, with a three-bay wing to the northeast and a two-bay wing to the southwest, and acted as a transition point between {{the street and the}} station interior. The first floor (at track level) featured a large waiting room occupying the entire center block, with vault lights providing natural illumination and a fountain set into the <b>western</b> <b>wall.</b> Restrooms, a kitchen, and a cafe occupied the wings.|$|E
5|$|At the {{southern}} end of the <b>Western</b> <b>Wall,</b> Robinson's Arch along with a row of vaults once supported stairs ascending from the street to the Temple Mount. Because it does not come under the direct control of the Rabbi of the Wall or the Ministry of Religious Affairs, the site has been opened to religious groups that hold worship services that would not be approved by the Rabbi or the Ministry in the major men's and women's prayer areas against the Wall.|$|E
50|$|Bektöre died on 18 December 1961 in Istanbul. He {{was buried}} at Adrianopole Gate, {{outside of the}} <b>western</b> <b>walls</b> of old Constantinople.

50|$|In December 2014, ISIL {{blew up the}} city's {{northern}} and <b>western</b> <b>walls,</b> causing extensive damage. The militants also excavated some of the ruins within the citadel, probably to look for antiquities which they could sell. UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova strongly condemned {{the destruction of the}} citadel.|$|R
50|$|The temple {{stood at}} the edge of Colonia Patricia, at the edge of the <b>western</b> <b>walls.</b> A small stretch of the wall was {{destroyed}} to build the temple. The land was cleared and leveled, creating a square artificial terrace at the center of which stood the temple.|$|R
5|$|During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War the Old City {{together}} with the Wall was controlled by Jordan. Article VIII of the 1949 Armistice Agreement provided for Israeli Jewish access to the <b>Western</b> <b>Wall.</b> However, for the following nineteen years, despite numerous requests by Israeli officials and Jewish groups to the United Nations and other international bodies to attempt to enforce the armistice agreement, Jordan refused to abide by this clause. Neither Israeli Arabs nor Israeli Jews could visit their holy places in the Jordanian territories.|$|E
5|$|From October 1928 onward, Mufti Amin al-Husayni {{organised}} {{a series}} of measures to demonstrate the Arabs' exclusive claims to the Temple Mount and its environs. He ordered new construction next to and above the <b>Western</b> <b>Wall.</b> The British granted the Arabs permission to convert a building adjoining the Wall into a mosque and to add a minaret. A muezzin was appointed to perform the Islamic call to prayer and Sufi rites directly next to the Wall. These were seen as a provocation by the Jews who prayed at the Wall. The Jews protested and tensions increased.|$|E
5|$|In 1895 Hebrew {{linguist}} {{and publisher}} Rabbi Chaim Hirschensohn became entangled in a failed effort {{to purchase the}} <b>Western</b> <b>Wall</b> and lost all his assets. Even the attempts of the Palestine Land Development Company to purchase the environs of the <b>Western</b> <b>Wall</b> for the Jews just before the outbreak of World War I never came to fruition. In {{the first two months}} following the Ottoman Empire’s entry into the First World War, the Turkish governor of Jerusalem, Zakey Bey, offered to sell the Moroccan Quarter, which consisted of about 25 houses, to the Jews in order to enlarge the area available to them for prayer. He requested a sum of £20,000 which would be used to both rehouse the Muslim families and to create a public garden in front of the Wall. However, the Jews of the city lacked the necessary funds. A few months later, under Muslim Arab pressure on the Turkish authorities in Jerusalem, Jews became forbidden by official decree to place benches and light candles at the Wall. This sour turn in relations was taken up by the Chacham Bashi who managed to get the ban overturned. In 1915 it was reported that Djemal Pasha closed off the wall to visitation as a sanitary measure.|$|E
50|$|The {{ruins of}} the medieval church in Aglish, which was built of stone and lime, still show the {{northern}} and <b>western</b> <b>walls.</b> The old graveyard is {{to the rear of}} the western gable. A new graveyard was opened in the 1970s, and is still being used for families in the area.|$|R
50|$|After {{the capital}} {{was moved to}} Beijing in 1406, the {{southern}} city wall was moved south by 2 li (about a kilometre). The original Dadu city walls were not destroyed, except for a small section that overlapped the planned Ming Imperial city. Nevertheless, Dadu's southern city walls were gradually torn down by people looking for free bricks and stones. Dadu's eastern and <b>western</b> <b>walls</b> remained standing. During the Yongle era (1402-1424), the southern, eastern, and <b>western</b> <b>walls</b> were reinforced with stones and bricks. In 1435 construction began on gate towers, watchtowers, barbicans, sluice gates, and corner guard towers for the nine city gates. In 1439 bridges were built leading to the gates. In 1445 the interior walls of the city were reinforced with bricks. The wall and moat system of the Inner city was thus complete.|$|R
5000|$|The {{sculpture}} is {{an outdoor}} circular concrete pad [...] in diameter circumscribed by eight walls [...] high by [...] wide. Four {{of the walls}} are in the cardinal directions, with four adjacent walls situated at angular distances of 23.4 degrees (corresponding with the axial tilt of the Earth) {{north and south of}} the east and west walls. The cardinal East and West walls have square windows, the four adjacent walls have isosceles trapezoid windows. At sunrise of any given day, the sunlight hitting the eastern walls will cast shadows across the circle, as light passes through the windows. As the Sun rises the shadows will shorten, appearing to shrink away from the <b>western</b> <b>walls</b> until the Sun reaches solar noon. The shadows of the three <b>western</b> <b>walls</b> then grow towards the eastern walls as the Sun continues west.|$|R
