25|$|The folk {{religious}} practices offer {{a very different}} aspect of life from the Buddhist practices. Burmese folk faith consists of {{many different kinds of}} festivals that all involve singing and dancing, drinking and merriment, or nat-pwes. These festivals are a <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> let go, and enjoy themselves. This idea of relieving stress and indulging in various pleasures {{is very different from the}} traditional doctrine of Buddhism, which emphasises losing all desires. This can often be done by fasting or through deep meditation in a quiet temple. These traditional Buddhist practices offer a starkly different way of achieving religious consciousness.|$|E

This is the state-funded {{institution}} for people with disabilities in American Fork, Utah. In 1983 Congress added section 1915(c) to the Social Security Act. This addition provided for the creation of Medicaid waivers. It also outlined the contractual obligations of states choosing to establish waiver programs with Medicaid. Waiver programs were considered a positive step as they provided a <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> lead less-restricted lives in the community. Studies that supported waivers cited cost-effectiveness as the main reason why they should be enacted. It was argued that providing the same institutional care in the community cost less.|$|E

Witte has said that in less than 10 years, online dating will be the predominant <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> start a relationship.

After a few {{performances}} in 2003, the band began to record demos at 2fly studios in Sheffield. 18 songs were demoed in all and the collection, {{now known as}} Beneath the Boardwalk, was burned on to CDs to give away at gigs, which were promptly file-shared amongst fans. The name Beneath the Boardwalk originated when the first batch of demos were sent around. The first sender, wanting to classify the demos, named them after where he received them, the Boardwalk. Slowly, as more demos were spread, they were all classified under this name. This has led to many people falsely believing that Beneath the Boardwalk was an early album, or that the early demos were all released under this title. The group did not mind the distribution, saying [...] "we never made those demos to make money or anything.

Originally, it was considered a somewhat expensive fad, as it lacked the live atmosphere of a real performance and 100 yen in the 1970s was the price of two typical lunches, but it caught on as a popular kind of entertainment. Karaoke machines were initially placed in restaurants and hotel rooms; soon, new businesses called karaoke boxes, with compartmented rooms, became popular.

In hunter/gatherer tribes, there are no formal laws, only inherent practices that determine the identity of the tribe.

[...] Instead, he argues that the laws and customs that arise from each tribe are sustainable and “right” in their own way because they work for the tribe.
