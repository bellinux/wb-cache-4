5|$|Although {{the eyes}} of most microbat species are small and poorly developed, leading to poor visual acuity, no species is blind. Microbats have mesopic vision, meaning that they can only detect light in low levels, whereas other mammals have {{photopic}} vision, which allows colour vision. Microbats may use their vision for orientation and <b>while</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> travelling between their roosting grounds and their feeding grounds, as echolocation is only effective over short distances. Some species can detect ultraviolet (UV). As the bodies of some microbats have distinct coloration, {{they may be able}} to discriminate colours.|$|E

5|$|At {{least in}} some species, {{juvenile}} ctenophores appear capable of producing small quantities of eggs and sperm <b>while</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> well below adult size, and adults produce eggs and sperm {{for as long as}} they have sufficient food. If they run short of food, they first stop producing eggs and sperm, and then shrink in size. When the food supply improves, they grow back to normal size and then resume reproduction. These features make ctenophores capable of increasing their populations very quickly.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the play, {{the actors}} file out slowly (most {{important}} first, with gaps between actors), and <b>while</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> on the bridge (hashigakari), the audience claps restrainedly.

A play may end with the shite character leaving the stage as part of the story (as in Kokaji, for instance)—rather than ending with all characters on stage—in which case one claps as the character exits.|$|E

Terri arrives <b>while</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> talking and is angered by Holly's presence. Will asks her to leave, telling her that their reunion was a mistake and concluding their relationship for good.|$|E
5|$|The American Water Spaniel, (often {{abbreviated}} to AWS), is a breed of spaniel which {{originated in the}} United States. Developed {{in the state of}} Wisconsin during the 19th century from a number of other breeds, including the Irish and English Water Spaniels. The breed was saved by Dr. Fred J. Pfeifer, who set up the breed club and standard, and whose work led to recognition for the breed by the United Kennel Club, and later, the American Kennel Club. <b>While</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> the state dog of Wisconsin, they remain a rare breed.|$|E
