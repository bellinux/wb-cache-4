5|$|The Central Committee elected Stalin General Secretary of the Central Committee at its 1st Plenary Session. Vyacheslav Molotov {{served as}} Stalin's deputy, an {{informal}} post {{referred to by}} Sovietologists as Second Secretary, and was empowered to manage party business and sign Politburo resolutions when Stalin <b>was</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Moscow. Upon Molotov's appointment as SNK Chairman in December 1930, Lazar Kaganovich took his place as Second Secretary.|$|E

5|$|Church members {{reported}} that Father Feit's confession line moved slowly {{that night and}} that he <b>was</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the sanctuary several times. When the canal {{at the crime scene}} was drained several days after the discovery of Garza's body, Feit's photo slide viewer was found in the canal. Fellow priests noticed scratch marks on Feit's hands after midnight mass, and they said it was irregular for Feit to have taken Garza to the church rectory to hear her confession. The McAllen Police Department initially said that Feit passed polygraph tests, but the tests were later said to be inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|The cirque where Castle Lake {{is found}} {{is a classic}} Northern Hemisphere cirque. The cirque {{headwall}} (the highest part of the mountain where the glacier began to form) was in the south or southwest, and {{the part of the}} mountain that sloped downward to the northeast <b>was</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the prevailing winds. The resulting shaded area was sheltered from direct sun, and from the evaporating effects of wind. These conditions encouraged snow which had fallen in the winter to remain throughout the summer and fall, creating a year-round snow pack which grew deeper each year.|$|E

5|$|During a {{game against}} the Canucks on March 8, 2004, Canucks player Todd Bertuzzi punched Colorado's Steve Moore from behind, leaving Moore unconscious. It was said to be {{retaliation}} for a hit Moore had delivered to Canucks captain Markus Naslund the month before. Because of the punch and the consequent fall on the ice with Bertuzzi on top of him, and numerous other players from both teams piling on top, Moore sustained three fractured neck vertebrae, among other injuries, that ended his career. Bertuzzi <b>was</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> professional hockey for 17 months as a result of suspensions. In Denver, ever since the Moore hit, it has become tradition for the home fans to boo Todd Bertuzzi every time he gains possession of the puck, whenever his team faces the Avalanche at Pepsi Center.|$|E
5|$|During that era, {{hospital}} {{nurses and}} midwives were {{trained on the}} job. Schwester Selma trained and supervised all the nurses, operating-room nurses, and midwives in the hospital, teaching the former {{how to make a}} hospital bed and the latter how to diaper newborns and swaddle infants. Sometimes she also substituted for the midwives, who did not live on the premises. For many years, Schwester Selma was Dr. Wallach's right-hand assistant in the areas of uterine curettages, tracheotomies, and ritual circumcisions, accompanied him on house calls, and stood in for him as hospital director when he <b>was</b> <b>away.</b> <b>From</b> 1916 to 1930 she was also in charge of supplies and building maintenance, and making sure the kashrut in the kitchen met Dr. Wallach's strict standards.|$|E
5|$|From Methone, {{the fleet}} sailed up the Ionian Sea to Zacynthus, {{from where they}} crossed over to Italy. The {{crossing}} took longer than expected {{due to lack of}} wind, and the army suffered of lack of fresh water when the supplies they had brought aboard went bad. Eventually, the fleet reached Catania in Sicily, from where Belisarius sent Procopius ahead to Syracuse to gather intelligence on the Vandals' activities. By chance, Procopius met a merchant friend of his there, whose servant had just arrived from Carthage. The latter informed Procopius that not only were the Vandals unaware of Belisarius' sailing, but that Gelimer, who had just dispatched Tzazon's expedition to Sardinia, <b>was</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Carthage at the small inland town of Hermione. Procopius quickly informed Belisarius, who immediately ordered the army to re-embark and set sail for the African coast. After sailing by Malta, they reached Cape Caputvada on the eastern shore of modern Tunisia some 162 Roman miles (240km) south from Carthage.|$|E

5|$|On February 15, {{with the}} fort surrounded, the Confederates, {{commanded}} by Brig. Gen. John B. Floyd, launched a surprise {{attack against the}} right flank of Grant's army {{in an attempt to}} open an escape route to Nashville, Tennessee. Grant, who <b>was</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the battlefield {{at the start of the}} attack, arrived to rally his men and counterattack. Despite achieving partial success and opening the way for a retreat, Floyd lost his nerve and ordered his men back to the fort. The following morning, Floyd and his second-in-command, Brig. Gen. Gideon Johnson Pillow, escaped with a small detachment of troops, relinquishing command to Brig. Gen. Simon Bolivar Buckner, who accepted Grant's terms of unconditional surrender later that day.|$|E
5|$|To {{make matters}} worse for Aberhart, Minister of Lands and Mines Charles Cathmer Ross {{resigned}} late in 1936, followed by Provincial Treasurer Charles Cockroft on January29, 1937. Neither minister's resignation was {{directly related to the}} dissidents' complaints: Ross resigned over disagreements with Aberhart on oil policy, while Cockroft left over a combination of ill health, clashes with Aberhart over the issue of a federal-provincial loan council, government investment policies, and Aberhart's approach to patronage. Nevertheless, the resignations were the public's first clue of dissent in Social Credit's ranks. Cockroft's resignation was followed by that of his deputy, J. F. Perceval, and there were rumours that Hugill and Minister of Agriculture and Trade and Industry William Chant would soon follow. This left Minister of Health Wallace Warren Cross, Minister of Public Works and Railways and Telephones William Fallow, and Provincial Secretary Ernest Manning as Aberhart's only indisputably loyal ministers, and Manning <b>was</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the legislature, ill with tuberculosis. On February19, William Carlos Ives of the Supreme Court of Alberta dealt the government another blow when he struck down key provincial legislation, including one act reducing the interest paid on the province's bonds by half (though this was only a technical defeat, since the government had been defaulting on its bond payments since the previous April).|$|E
