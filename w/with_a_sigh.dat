5|$|Sandy, Patrick, and Squidward {{arrive at}} a gas station and from reading a {{newspaper}} article, discover SpongeBob's appointment as mayor of New Kelp City. But when they go to New Kelp City to retrieve him, SpongeBob cannot remember who they are. Squidward hi-jinks SpongeBob's limousine and gets away from the city with SpongeBob, Patrick and Sandy in tow and they return to the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob still does not recall the eatery and wants to return to New Kelp City to resume his job as mayor. Delighted that SpongeBob is leaving again, Squidward requests for his jewel encrusted egg but slips and accidentally throws the egg onto SpongeBob's head, which causes his memory to come back. Patrick, Sandy and Mr. Krabs apologize to SpongeBob for selfishly running him out of Bikini Bottom and are happy to have him back. But even so, SpongeBob still wants to return to New Kelp City. He changes his mind after a breaking news report comes on, saying that the bubbles in New Kelp City are blinding the citizens, and a thug threatens to do something to SpongeBob if he ever comes back. SpongeBob starts cooking Krabby Patties again, much to his friends' delight. <b>With</b> <b>a</b> <b>sigh</b> of happiness, SpongeBob says that it looks like he will be back in Bikini Bottom. Upon hearing this, Squidward takes out his brain and drops it in a trash can.|$|E
500|$|The {{game has}} been called a flawed {{masterpiece}} by critics. The scale and variety of choice and effect was highlighted by reviewers as Bloodlines greatest success, including the variety of clans, with specific dialog options, and the specific reactions from other characters, each with their own clan loyalty and bias. GameSpy called it a nearly flawless classic role-playing game; The New York Times described it as brilliant but unfinished. Eurogamer praised its [...] "effortlessly intelligent" [...] script, saying that [...] "no other game has come close. Nothing's even tried". VideoGamer.com opined that at its best, Bloodlines stands among the greatest RPGs of the preceding five years, although its technical problems should be remembered. According to HonestGamers, the game [...] "may not be polished and may end <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sigh</b> instead of a shout, but for its ambition alone it deserves stream after stream of compliments." [...] Reviewers compared it to other successful role-playing games, including Fallout, , , , , and Deus Ex; Eurogamer described Bloodlines as Deus Ex with vampires.|$|E
500|$|... "Pink Matter" [...] is a bluesy lament with {{themes of}} sex and betrayal, as its narrator struggles between {{pleasure}} and universal meaning. Its lyrics allude to philosophical conundrums, extraterrestrial life, Japanese manga comics, and cotton candy. The playful [...] "Forrest Gump" [...] likens the titular film character to an adolescent crush, with homoerotic, tongue-in-cheek lyrics, and allusions to scenes in the film. It has a bright, Motown-inspired chorus, a simple rhythmic cadence, gently strummed guitar, wistful vocals, and a perkily whistled coda. The skit [...] "End" [...] depicts an exchange between Ocean and a woman as they make love {{in the backseat of}} a car with his 2012 song [...] "Voodoo" [...] playing over the stereo. She says to him, [...] "You're special. I wish you could see what I see", repurposing a line from the 2006 film ATL, and Ocean leaves the car in response, walks home through the rain, and sets his keys down <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sigh.</b> The lighthearted, lovelorn [...] "Golden Girl" [...] has up-tempo synths, gradual fades, and Tyler, The Creator rapping in a low-pitched, demonic voice. It is about a girl that provides salvation and peace of mind for the narrator, who likens her to an island.|$|E
60|$|She {{left him}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> little <b>sigh.</b> It sounded like <b>a</b> <b>sigh</b> of relief.|$|R
5000|$|In {{his review}} for AllMusic, Steve Loewy states [...] "Moondoc is an underrated heavyweight of the saxophone: The elder statesman drinks {{from the well}} of Ornette Coleman, but Moondoc plies his own sound <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sighing</b> lyricism that lures the {{listener}} into his den." ...|$|R
60|$|Hypatia throws aside {{her work}} <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{enormous}} <b>sigh</b> of relief.|$|R
2500|$|As a child, Sheehan was fair-haired and {{delicate}} with [...] "large wistful blue eyes". [...] He {{was described as}} [...] "a bit of a dreamer, and when other lads were shouting at play, he went alone to some copse or thicket, and with a book, or more often without one, would sit and think, and look dreamily at floating clouds or running stream; and then, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sigh</b> {{go back to his}} desk".|$|E
2500|$|... “Are there woman, really? Most assuredly {{the theory}} of the eternal {{feminine}} still has its adherents who will whisper in your ear: ‘Even in Russia women are still women’; and other erudite persons—sometimes the very same—say <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sigh,</b> ‘Woman is losing her way, woman is lost.’” (34) De Beauvoir refers, to the “eternal feminine,” it can be what define some kind of spiritual being that connect all women to each other.|$|E
2500|$|... "The speaker begins <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sigh</b> that {{suggests}} the same weariness that he attributes to the Sunflower (a suggestion emphasized by the heavy stresses in the song). The wistful tone and the implied {{sympathy for the}} time-bound victims are disarming. But, as many critics have noted, the poem is not without irony...the sense of timeless rest is soon complicated by the ambiguous syntax." [...] Indeed, Bloom {{goes so far as}} to say that [...] "the lyric's tone can be characterized as a kind of apocalyptic sardonicism." ...|$|E
60|$|She was {{certainly}} difficult. Francis realised that <b>with</b> <b>a</b> little <b>sigh.</b>|$|R

2500|$|... "Bati" [...] is a {{traditional}} song, telling of a man longing for his beloved woman, and going after her to Bati. The western listener may be familiar with this song from Ethiopiques Volume 15, which opens with a pounding performance of this song. Barihun and Yedid formulate a contemplative arrangement for this composition, which preserves its original mode. The piano silently accompanies Barihun's sobbing soprano sax, then his singing. Towards the fifth minute Yedid interprets the piece on his piano, to which Barihun joins for a penetrating duet. The composition ends with Barihun's singing, sealed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sigh.</b>|$|E
2500|$|An exultant Stilwell {{immediately}} delivered {{this letter}} to Chiang despite pleas from Patrick J. Hurley, Roosevelt's special envoy in China, to delay delivering {{the message and}} work on a deal that would achieve Stilwell's aim in a manner more acceptable to Chiang. Stillwell wrote in his diary about handing over Roosevelt's message: [...] "I handed this bundle of paprika to the Peanut and than sank back <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sigh.</b> The harpoon hit the little bugger right in the solar plexus and went right through him. It was a clean hit, but beyond turning green and losing his powers of speech, he did not bat an eye". The British journalist Jonathan Fenby wrote about Roosevelt's letter: [...] "Unless the President was ready for America to take over effective control of China, or halt Lend-Lease supplies and abandon the KMT to its fate, his stern words merely amounted to bluff". Seeing this act as a move toward the complete subjugation of China, Chiang gave a formal reply {{in which he said}} that Stilwell must be replaced immediately and he would welcome any other qualified U.S. general to fill Stilwell's position. Chiang called Roosevelt's letter the [...] "greatest humiliation I have been subjected to in my life" [...] and stated it was [...] "all too obvious that the United States intends to intervene in China's internal affairs". Chiang told Hurley the Chinese people were [...] "tired of the insults which Stillwell has seen fit to heap upon them". Chiang delivered a speech before the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, which was leaked to the press, which called Roosevelt's letter a form of imperialism and stated that to accept Roosevelt's demands would make him no different from the Japanese collaborator Wang Jingwei in Nanking. On 12 October 1944, Hurley reported to Washington that Stilwell was a [...] "fine man, but was incapable of understanding or co-operating with Chiang Kai-shek", going on to say that if Stilwell remained in command, all of China might be lost to the Japanese. Before sending his cable, Hurley showed it to Stilwell who accused Hurley [...] to his face of [...] "cutting my throat with a dull knife".|$|E
