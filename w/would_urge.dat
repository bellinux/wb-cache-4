25|$|Charmaine Bucco: {{the wife}} of Artie Bucco and a {{childhood}} friend of Carmela and Tony Soprano. Throughout the series, she <b>would</b> <b>urge</b> Artie not {{to deal with the}} mobsters in his career and life, but eventually started to seemingly tolerate their gatherings in their restaurant.|$|E
25|$|Goldman contends Ono {{encouraged}} Lennon's {{heroin addiction}} {{as a way}} of controlling him and his vast fortune, to her own ends. She also supposedly used tarot-reading charlatans to feed Lennon readings that <b>would</b> <b>urge</b> him to take various courses of action Ono supported. These readings would determine seemingly trivial choices of Lennon's life, such as which route the limo would take home from the studio or which day was most propitious on which to record, but were, in fact, according to Goldman, often part of Ono's constant machinations. Ono's concern for routes and directions reflects a belief in Japanese traditional katatagae, but this is overlooked by Goldman, who has been accused of racism.|$|E
25|$|As a young child, Gould {{was taught}} piano by his mother. At {{the age of}} 10, he began {{attending}} The Royal Conservatory of Music (known until 1947, when it received a Royal Charter from King George VI, as the Toronto Conservatory of Music) in Toronto. He studied music theory with Leo Smith, the organ with Frederick C. Silvester, and piano with Alberto Guerrero. Around the same time, he injured his back {{as a result of}} a fall from a boat ramp on the shore of Lake Simcoe. This incident is almost certainly related to the adjustable-height chair his father made shortly thereafter. Gould's mother <b>would</b> <b>urge</b> the young Gould to sit up straight at the keyboard. He used this chair for the rest of his life and took it with him almost everywhere. The famous chair was designed so that Gould could sit very low at the keyboard. The chair allowed him to pull down on the keys rather than striking them from above, a central technical idea of his teacher at the Conservatory, Alberto Guerrero.|$|E

25|$|Dr. Elliot Kupferberg: Dr. Melfi's own {{psychotherapist}} {{and mentor}} who <b>would</b> often <b>urge</b> her to drop Tony Soprano as a patient. Also, an enthusiast of the Mafia.|$|R

25|$|But Lillinonah {{refused to}} eat or drink. Her once lovely face turned sallow {{and she began to}} shrink before the very eyes of her distraught father. As summer waned, the once {{beautiful}} daughter of Waramaug became a pale shadow of her former self, so great was her pain and powerful her will. Finally, although he still regarded marriage between his daughter and a white man as a burden almost too heavy to bear, Waramaug relented. Reluctantly, he consented to the marriage of his beloved Lillinonah to the man she had found lost in the woods on that long ago winter's day. Before the marriage could take place, the betrothed couple agreed, the fair young man should return to his own people, {{to let them know that}} he was still alive and well, and to tell them of his plans to wed Lillinonah and live for the rest of his life in the company of the Pootatucks. Both lovers realized that his people <b>would</b> <b>urge</b> him not to go back to his lovely Indian princess. They would remind him that there were plenty of young English women in the colonies just looking for a husband as attractive as he was. What right had he to wed a dusky maid from a foreign and inferior race? But he promised Lillinonah that no argument would ever persuade him to break their vow to marry. After one final winter with his own people, he would return to Lillinonah -- in the early spring. Sadly, he took his leave.|$|E
500|$|His {{mother was}} deeply {{religious}} and disciplined, {{and had a}} major influence on him in religious matters. During church service, his mother <b>would</b> <b>urge</b> him to contribute his few pennies to the congregation. He came to associate the church with charity. A Baptist preacher once encouraged him to [...] "make as much money as he could, and then give away as much as he could". Later in his life, Rockefeller recalled: [...] "It was at this moment, that the financial plan of my life was formed". Money making was considered by him a God-given gift.|$|E
500|$|McCain {{stated that}} the American public wanted a First Lady of the United States who would tend toward a {{traditional}} role in that position. [...] She would not attend Cabinet meetings, but would continue her involvement in overseas non-profit organizations and <b>would</b> <b>urge</b> Americans {{to do the same}} globally or locally. She envisioned herself as a possible figurehead for humanitarian work, along the lines of Diana, Princess of Wales. [...] She continued to expand her roles in such organizations, joining in April 2008 the board of Grateful Nation Montana, which provides scholarships and services to the children of Montana service personnel killed in Iraq and Afghanistan.|$|E

60|$|Is it {{generally}} realized {{that every day}} at least one fatal accident occurs in our streets? So many of these take place at crossings that we <b>would</b> strongly <b>urge</b> the public never to venture across a busy street until all the vehicles have passed.|$|R
500|$|The Dodgers {{assigned}} Stengel to the Montgomery Rebels of the Class A Southern Association for the 1912 season. Playing for manager Kid Elberfeld, Stengel batted [...]290 and led {{the league}} in outfield assists. He also developed a reputation as an eccentric player. Scout Mike Kahoe referred to Stengel as a [...] "dandy ballplayer, but it's all from the neck down." [...] After reporting to Brooklyn in September and getting a taste of the big leagues, he spent a third offseason at dental school in 1912â€“1913. He did not graduate, though whenever his baseball career hit a bad patch in the years to follow, his wife Edna <b>would</b> <b>urge</b> him to get his degree.|$|E
500|$|The BNA {{downplayed the}} effect of the protests, saying it was [...] "business as usual" [...] in the country. [...] "Bahrainis and expatriates {{reported}} to work on Wednesday just like any other day, defying calls by radical opposition groups of road blockades and attack on properties," [...] the state-run agency added. Critics said the protests failed as most streets were empty and protests disorganized. Abdulla Al Junaid of the pro-government National Union Gathering said an opposition cleric criticized Tamarod as a [...] "stillborn". The United States expressed its concern at the possibility of violence. [...] "We remain very concerned about continuing incidents of violence in Bahrain and, of course, the possibility for violence and <b>would</b> <b>urge</b> all parties to strongly condemn violence and contribute to fostering a climate of dialogue and reconciliation," [...] said the spokesperson of State Department. The spokesperson added that they [...] "support the right of individuals to peacefully assemble and of course, the right of freedom of expression, including in Bahrain".|$|E
500|$|African-American {{travelers}} faced real physical risks {{because of}} the widely differing rules of segregation that existed from place to place, {{and the possibility of}} extrajudicial violence against them. Activities that were accepted in one place could provoke violence a few miles down the road. Transgressing formal or unwritten racial codes, even inadvertently, could put travelers in considerable danger. Even driving etiquette was affected by racism; in the Mississippi Delta region, local custom prohibited blacks from overtaking whites, to prevent their raising dust from the unpaved roads to cover white-owned cars. A pattern emerged of whites purposefully damaging black-owned cars to put their owners [...] "in their place". Stopping anywhere that was not known to be safe, even to allow children in a car to relieve themselves, presented a risk; Milloy noted that his parents <b>would</b> <b>urge</b> him and his brother to control their need to use a bathroom until they could find a safe place to stop, as [...] "those backroads were simply too dangerous for parents to stop to let their little black children pee".|$|E
60|$|The men shivered--more with vague superstitious fear {{than with}} cold. They <b>would</b> have <b>urged</b> their horses on, but {{the wheels of}} the coaches stuck {{persistently}} in the mud, and now and again a halt had to be called so that the spokes and axles might be cleared.|$|R
6000|$|... "They had reference, without doubt, to the {{inclination}} of your father's daughter," [...] answered the attendant. [...] "I {{will not do}} my late noble lord--(may God assoilzie him!)--the injustice to suppose he <b>would</b> have <b>urged</b> aught in this matter which squared not with your free choice." ...|$|R
2500|$|The European Union Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson {{characterized}} the collapse as a [...] "collective failure". On a more optimistic note, India's Commerce Minister, Kamal Nath, said [...] "I <b>would</b> only <b>urge</b> the director-general to treat this [...] as a pause, not a breakdown, {{to keep on}} the table what is there." ...|$|R
500|$|Not {{only did}} Grant {{believe that the}} island would be of use to the Navy tactically, {{particularly}} SamanÃ¡ Bay, but also he sought {{to use it as}} a bargaining chip. By providing a safe haven for the freedmen, he believed that the exodus of black labor would force Southern whites to realize the necessity of such a significant workforce and accept their civil rights. Grant believed the island country would increase exports and lower the trade deficit. He hoped that U.S. ownership of the island <b>would</b> <b>urge</b> Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Brazil to abandon slavery. On March 15, 1870, the Foreign Relations Committee, headed by Sen. Charles Sumner, recommended against treaty passage. Sumner, the leading spokesman for African American civil rights, believed that annexation would be enormously expensive and involve the U.S. in an ongoing civil war, and would threaten the independence of Haiti and the West Indies, thereby blocking black political progress. On May 31, 1870 Grant went before Congress and urged passage of the Dominican annexation treaty. [...] Strongly opposed to ratification, Sumner successfully led the opposition in the Senate. On June 30, 1870 the Santo Domingo annexation treaty failed to pass the Senate; 28 votes in favor of the treaty and 28 votes against. Grant's own cabinet was divided over the Santo Domingo annexation attempt, and Bancroft Davis, assistant to Sec. Hamilton Fish, was secretly giving information to Sen. Sumner on state department negotiations.|$|E
500|$|The Princess of Wales {{opposed the}} match between her {{daughter}} and the Prince of Orange, and had great public support: [...] when Charlotte went out in public, crowds <b>would</b> <b>urge</b> her not to abandon her mother by marrying the Prince of Orange. [...] Charlotte informed the Prince of Orange that if they wed, her mother {{would have to be}} welcome in their homeâ€”a condition sure to be unacceptable to the Prince Regent. [...] When the Prince of Orange would not agree, Charlotte broke off the engagement. [...] Her father's response was to order that Charlotte remain at her residence at Warwick House (adjacent to Carlton House) until she could be conveyed to Cranbourne Lodge at Windsor, where she would be allowed to see no one except the Queen. [...] When told of this, Charlotte raced out into the street. [...] A man, seeing her distress from a window, helped the inexperienced Princess find a hackney cab, in which she was conveyed to her mother's house. [...] Caroline was visiting friends and hastened back to her house, while Charlotte summoned Whig politicians to advise her. [...] A number of [...] family members also gathered, including her uncle, the Duke of Yorkâ€”with a warrant in his pocket to secure her return by force if need be. [...] After lengthy arguments, the Whigs advised her to return to her father's house, which she did the next day.|$|E
2500|$|Defense lawyer Sharp {{expressed}} scepticism regarding {{both the}} terrorism and assault charges: [...] "I think it's interesting {{that they make}} all these allegations about the dirty bombs and other items she supposedly had, but they haven't charged her with anything relating to terrorism... I <b>would</b> <b>urge</b> people to consider her as innocent unless the government proves otherwise." ...|$|E
60|$|Lambert's scruples and {{his desire}} to please {{struggled}} hopelessly in his mind. Mistress Endicott's eye held him silent even while it urged him to speak. What could he say? Sir Marmaduke, toward whom he felt gratitude and respect, surely <b>would</b> not <b>urge</b> what he thought would be wrong for Lambert.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes papa;' and it {{was plain}} enough how it had been. Lord Martindale sighed. The rest being equal, {{it was not in}} human nature not to prefer an Earl to an almost penniless author. 'I <b>would</b> not <b>urge</b> you on any account,' he said; 'but I wish it could have been otherwise.' ...|$|R
50|$|Had Kurtzman {{stayed with}} Mad, {{he said he}} <b>would</b> have <b>urged</b> Gaines to include advertising, as did Feldstein to no avail. Ad revenue might have allowed for higher {{production}} values, such as color interiors. Kurtzman intended to keep the focus on a teenage and adult audience, rather than the younger audience Feldstein's Mad appealed to.|$|R
2500|$|... â€“ The Foreign Office stated, [...] "We <b>would</b> <b>urge</b> Turkey to {{withdraw}} from Iraqi territory {{as early as possible}} and take the greatest possible care to avoid causing harm to the civilian population." [...] On February 23 Turkish Foreign Minister Ali Babacan called British Foreign Minister David Miliband to update him on the operation's progress and exchange views.|$|E
2500|$|On 3 June 2015, Minister Vidar Helgesen said Norway {{had asked}} Israel {{to abolish the}} {{restrictions}} against Vanunu leaving Israel for humanitarian considerations. Centre Party foreign policy spokesman Navarsete stated, [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>urge</b> the government to make a differenceâ€¦it would attract international attention if Norway gave nuclear whistleblower asylum or emergency passport â€“ despite the Israeli sanctions against him." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the U.S. State Department's daily {{briefing}} for Friday, February 3, official spokesman Sean McCormick, {{speaking for}} the current administration, said (in part), [...] "Our response {{is to say that}} while we certainly don't agree with, support, or in some cases, we condemn the views that are aired in public that are published in media organizations around the world, we, at the same time, defend the right of those individuals to express their views. For us, freedom of expression {{is at the core of}} our democracy and it is something that we have shed blood and treasure around the world to defend and we will continue to do so. ... So we <b>would</b> <b>urge</b> all parties to exercise the maximum degree of understanding, the maximum degree of tolerance when they talk about this issue. And we <b>would</b> <b>urge</b> dialogue, not violence. And that also those that might take offense at these images that have been published, when they see similar views or images that could be perceived as anti-Semitic or anti-Catholic, that they speak out with equal vigor against those images." ...|$|E
50|$|In April 2012, Flanagan stated he <b>would</b> be <b>urging</b> {{people to}} vote No in the {{referendum}} on ratification of the European Fiscal Compact Treaty {{on the grounds that}} Ireland would lose power to bigger countries in Europe. He also stated that Ireland should leave the economic and monetary union (EMU), based on the euro currency.|$|R
50|$|This title <b>would</b> also <b>urge</b> the Chief of the United States Forest Service and the Director of the Bureau of Land Management to {{cooperate}} with state and local authorities and other entities to carry out waste removal and other activities on any federal land used as a public target range to encourage its continued use for target practice or marksmanship training.|$|R
60|$|Toby felt {{relieved}} at {{the tone}} of this leave taking. He had feared that Old Ben, who thought a circus rider was almost on the topmost round of fortune's ladder, <b>would</b> have <b>urged</b> him to stay, since {{he had made his}} debut in the ring, and he was almost afraid that he might take some steps to prevent his going.|$|R
2500|$|Democratic Representative Tim Bishop of New Yorks 1st District also {{disagrees with}} the location, [...] "As a New Yorker, I believe Ground Zero is sacred ground and should unite us. If the group seeking to build the mosque is sincere {{in its efforts to}} bring people together, I <b>would</b> <b>urge</b> them to seek an {{alternative}} location which is less divisive. I dispute the wisdom of building at that location, not the constitutional right." ...|$|E
2500|$|The phrase [...] "Bush Doctrine" [...] {{was rarely}} used {{by members of}} the Bush administration. The {{expression}} was used at least once, though, by Vice President Dick Cheney, in a June 2003 speech in which he said, [...] "If there is anyone in the world today who doubts the seriousness of the Bush Doctrine, I <b>would</b> <b>urge</b> that person to consider the fate of the Taliban in Afghanistan, and of Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq." ...|$|E
2500|$|India later updated its {{response}} to the crisis. After Modi returned to New Delhi, the High Commissioner of Bangladesh met with the Foreign Secretary of India. After the meeting, the Indian foreign ministry issued a statement: [...] "We <b>would</b> <b>urge</b> that the situation in Rakhine be handled with restraint and maturity, focusing on {{the welfare of the}} civilian population alongside those of the security forces". The Indian Air Force began Operation Insaniyat to deliver aid for Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh.|$|E
6000|$|... "We must refuse," [...] said Cartwright, {{with quiet}} firmness. [...] "A frightened {{committee}} <b>would</b> probably <b>urge</b> a drastic re-construction scheme, the writing off {{much of our}} capital, and perhaps winding up the line. When rates are bad and cargo's scarce, one must take a low price for ships; our liabilities are large, and I imagine selling off would leave us much in debt--" ...|$|R
5000|$|On November 8, 2004, a rally was {{scheduled}} {{on the occasion}} of the school's 68th anniversary. This was to include a press conference at which increased support of the school <b>would</b> be <b>urged.</b> On November 8, 2006 the school celebrated its 70th anniversary.
