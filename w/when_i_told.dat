Egan said that her mother [...] "told me he was a great character, but an evil one, so I was really excited. And now knowing Michael, it has been so much fun."

500|$|Theron Patterson, {{a friend}} of Moore's and former classmate at California Institute of the Arts, was working in Istanbul, Turkey and invited Moore to visit. Moore, who {{had been living in}} Costa Rica, stayed with him for two weeks, then decided to settle in Istanbul and record the third Chroma Key album there. Moore signed to InsideOut Records. [...] "They've been really great {{supporting}} this; they sent me out to Turkey <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> them I wanted to record out there, basically supporting the whole process," [...] he said. The first project Moore worked on after he moved to Istanbul was Ghost Book, the soundtrack to the Turkish film Okul. Moore enjoyed the experience and decided to write the third Chroma Key album as an alternate soundtrack to an already-existing film.|$|E
500|$|It {{was about}} getting revenge. People were always hating on me, because I was different. I was like, [...] "I'm going to sing, I'm {{going to do}} this, I'm going to do that," [...] they were like [...] "OK, sure you are." [...] And I was like [...] "No, I'm serious. This is what I'm going to do." [...] And {{everybody}} was like, [...] "Yeah right." [...] Even <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> everyone I was moving to LA to do music and had a going away party, only one person showed up, because no one believed that I was really going away.

500|$|In {{order to}} {{encourage}} the captains of the merchant ships of all countries which carry the lifeblood of the U.K., I {{made it a point}} to attend the briefing conference of all captains and chief engineers before their departure. During the winter of '42–'43, when sinkings were at their worst, I could see <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> them of the measures by escort and air cover that were being taken for their protection and safety; I could see that they knew very well and that they knew I knew in spite of my brave words, that anything up to 25 per cent of them would probably not arrive in the U.K. in their own ships, and that probably half of that number would not arrive in the U.K. at all. But there was never a waver in their resolve – Admiral Murray.|$|E

[...] <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> George and Ringo I'd agreed to that they were going, [...] "What? What if we love it?" [...] It didn't come to that, luckily.

500|$|In 1923, when Adams was 76, the {{following}} newspaper story appeared in The Salt Lake Tribune, telling of his whereabouts:Perhaps you old fellows, too, thought Yank had passed on, {{but he turned}} up in New York {{the other day and}} is now spending his last days in a Bronx flat. There was a time when Yank Adams was known in every billiard room in America. He was as much at home in Eddie Graney's room at San Francisco as at Tom Foley's in Chicago of Maurice Daly's in New York, and he knew all the billiard players and big and little room keepers from coast to coast. When the history of billiards is written and the names of Willie Hoppe, old and young Jake Schaefer and Welker Cochran are included with others of the great exponents of the indoor sport, there will be a distinct division for one man—the man who did the impossible, who could make the ivories travel the wrong way, or, {{in the language of the}} billiard realm, [...] "make 'em talk all languages." [...] That man is Frank B. Adams, known the world over as [...] "Yank" [...] Adams, at one time and even now the world's only finger billiardist who can make all the apparently impossible shots on the table without the aid of a cue. Adams is 76 years old, and after fifty years of exhibitions all over the [...] world has retired from active work to live in the Bronx and conduct a billiard academy of his own at Burnside and Creston avenues in New York with his business manager for the last ten years, Samuel Polakoff. Yank now lives at 635 West 136th street In New York. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> Tom Foley, the daddy of all the roommkeepers, that Yank Adams was back in the business he laughed and said: [...] "I thought Yank had cashed in. But he's like all those billiard players. They never die." ...|$|E

2500|$|Joe Macaluso, outdoor {{editor of}} the Baton Rouge Morning Advocate {{recalled}} a fishing trip with Gresham on Toledo Bend Reservoir at the Texas-Louisiana boundary.

And the next time I met him, he leaned even more to war. I felt the Emperor was telling me: 'My prime minister does not understand military matters. I know much more.'
