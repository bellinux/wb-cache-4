Featuring a format {{similar to the}} TV show wherein members of a live local {{audience}} could participate, the tour would later incorporate aspects of What <b>Would</b> <b>You</b> Do?, another show hosted by Summers for Nickelodeon. Some events in these tours sold out arenas they were held in, with attendance of more than 20,000 spectators. The tours and events resumed in 2000 to promote Double Dare 2000.|$|E
25|$|INTERVIEWER: Suppose {{someone called}} {{you and said}} there was a kid, {{nineteen}} or twenty years old, who has been a very good boy, {{but all of a sudden}} this week he started walking around the neighborhood carrying a large cross. The neighbors are upset and the family's upset, and <b>would</b> <b>you</b> do something about it. How <b>would</b> <b>you</b> think about that as a problem? Some kind of bizarre behavior like that.|$|E

25|$|Magnum was {{a member}} of Lordi from 1999 to 2002. He sang backing vocals for Bend Over and Pray the Lord album, played bass on Get Heavy album and {{can be seen in the}} music video for <b>Would</b> <b>You</b> Love a Monsterman?. He was fired in 2002 because other members of Lordi thought he doesn't have enough {{motivation}} for the band.|$|E

And I can sum up that difference in one word: none.|$|E
25|$|He wasn't a gregarious bloke, really. He was {{actually}} quite retiring, {{but he was}} always up for a bit of fun. He never seemed to take his cricket all that seriously, in that country way. Numbers didn't mean much to him. In a lot of respects he had that 'Hookesy' outlook. Why <b>would</b> <b>you</b> get eight not out in 10 overs? He couldn't understand, what's the use of that? His record suggests unfulfilled talent and I guess that's what it was to a certain extent.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the criticism of the Kinsey scale only measuring two dimensions of sexual orientation, Fritz Klein developed the Klein sexual orientation grid (KSOG), a multidimensional scale for describing sexual orientation. Introduced in Klein's book The Bisexual Option (1978), the KSOG uses a 7-point scale to assess seven different dimensions of sexuality at three different points in an individual's life: past (from early adolescence up to one year ago), present (within the last 12 months), and ideal (what <b>would</b> <b>you</b> choose if it were completely your choice).|$|E

25|$|The Afternoon Show {{was first}} {{presented}} by Anna Nolan, Blathnaid Ni Chofaigh and Sheana Keane. Anna Nolan left the show {{after a year}} to focus on more serious TV such as RTÉ's <b>Would</b> <b>You</b> Believe series of documentaries. Blathanid and Sheana both worked on the show together {{for a number of}} years until 2008 (when it was reported they had had a falling out), various presenters stepping into either Blathanid's or Sheana's shoes, with the final series being presented by Sheana and Maura Derrane (former Ireland AM presenter).|$|E
25|$|The Census, {{taken on}} 27 March 2011, asked {{a number of}} {{questions}} relating to nationality and national identity, including What is your country of birth? ('Wales' was one of the options), How <b>would</b> <b>you</b> describe your national identity? (for the first time 'Welsh' and 'English' were included as options), What is your ethnic group? ('White Welsh/English/Scottish/Northern Irish/British' was an option) and Can you understand, speak, read or write Welsh?. In December 2012 census results revealed that 66% of residents considered themselves to have a singular Welsh national identity, with another 10% stating they had a Welsh and British identity.|$|E
25|$|By the way, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> convey my {{compliments}} to the purist {{who reads}} your proofs {{and tell him}} or her that I write {{in a sort of}} broken-down patois which is something like the way a Swiss-waiter talks, and that when I split an infinitive, God damn it, I split it so it will remain split, and when I interrupt the velvety smoothness of my more or less literate syntax with a few sudden words of barroom vernacular, this is done with the eyes wide open and the mind relaxed and attentive. The method may not be perfect, but it is all I have.|$|E

25|$|Later, Reese {{made use}} of the growing library of hands from {{international}} competitions to create interesting quiz-type books, where the discussion was usually on the verso of the page which presented the problem. Famous Hands from Famous Matches {{was the first of}} these, followed by Famous Bidding Decisions and Famous Play Decisions, all written with David Bird. In his career as a writer, Reese had a number of co-authors, mostly highly competent players and writers, yet all his books were in his inimitable style. Another of his ideas was to raid the stock of hands in bridge magazine bidding competitions for interesting and instructive hands. What <b>Would</b> <b>You</b> Bid? was the result.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, Wallace {{moved up}} to the Winston Cup Series full-time, driving the No. 40 Dirt Devil Pontiac Grand Prix for SABCO Racing. The team got a {{considerable}} amount of television time as the team was featured on the TV show What <b>Would</b> <b>You</b> Do?. He had three top-tens and a twenty-third-place points finish, but lost his ride {{at the end of the}} season. He returned to the Busch Series to drive the No. 8 TIC Financial Systems Ford for FILMAR Racing. He picked up three wins and finished fourth in points. Towards the end of the season, he was hired by Robert Yates Racing to replace the injured Ernie Irvan in the Cup series. In twelve races, he finished in the top-ten three times. In 1995, Wallace and FILMAR split time between the Cup and Busch Series. Wallace had one win with the Red Dog Ford in the Busch Series, and made eleven starts in the Cup Series in the No. 81 car.|$|E
25|$|Following his wife's death, {{he began}} discerning a {{vocation}} {{to join a}} monastery, perhaps in France. One day, while discussing his vocation with the sister of Thomas Hussey, the Bishop of Waterford, a band of ragged boys passed by. She pointed to them, and cried:"What! <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> bury yourself in a cell on the continent rather than devote your wealth and your life to the spiritual and material interest of these poor youths?"After settling his business affairs in 1802, Rice {{devoted his life to}} prayer and charitable work, particularly with the poor and marginalised of Waterford. In 1802, when he established a makeshift school in a converted stable in New Street, Waterford, he found the children were so difficult to manage that the teachers resigned. This prompted him to sell his thriving business to another prominent Roman Catholic merchant, a Mr. Quan, and devote himself to training teachers who would dedicate their lives to prayers and to teaching the children free of charge. Despite the difficulties involved, Edmund's classes were so popular that another temporary school had to be set up on another of his properties, this time in nearby Stephen Street.|$|E

25|$|May 2002 {{also saw}} the revelation that the new public works minister, Don Boudria, had spent the weekend of March 16–17, 2002 at an estate owned by Claude Boulay, the {{president}} of Groupe Everest advertising firm that head received $55million in contracts from the public works ministry, apparently for free. Only after the story of Boudria's stay at the Boulay estate broke in May did Boulay cash an $800 cheque from Boudria that was dated March 16, 2002; many found this to be too convenient, and opposition critics suggested that the cheque had been post-dated to explain away what {{would otherwise have been}} a major ethical violation on the part of Boudria. Boudria was forced to resign on 26 May, to be replaced with Ralph Goodale. An additional scandal broke later in May 2002 when it was revealed that the Defence Minister Art Eggleton had rewarded a contract worth $36, 500 to research mental illness amongst former soldiers to his former lover Maggie Maier without tender {{while at the same time}} the Defence Ministry had already hired a team of experts to research the same subject. As Eggleton was a Paul Martin supporter, Chrétien promptly fired him on May 27, 2002, following a ruling from Howard Wilson that Eggleton had broken conflict-of-interest rules. Some such as the columnist Don Martin believed that Wilson's swift running against the Martinista Eggleton was suspicious with Martin writing Wilson had within a day ruled that Eggleton had broken conflict-of-interest rules while Martin wrote: “But what <b>would</b> <b>you</b> call the prime minister’s chat with a Crown corporation banker to bail out a hotel linked to a golf course he may still have an interest in? Funny, ethics counsellor Howard Wilson was in a “see no evil” monkey mode on that score”.|$|E
