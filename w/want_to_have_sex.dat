40|$|Background: Understanding people’s sexual motivations {{has long}} been {{of public health and}} health {{promotion}} interest. We used daily diaries to examine how adult men’s and women’s event-specific affective sexual motivations were linked to the types and combinations of sexual behaviours chosen in a given sexual event. Methods: Adult men (n[*]=[*] 156) and women (n[*]=[*] 192) completed thrice-daily electronic diaries assessing individual- and partner-specific attributes and non-coital or coital sexual behaviours. Sexual motivations were: interest in sex, feeling in love with partner, <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> and partner <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex.</b> The outcome variable was: sexual behaviour type (no sex, one vaginal sex event, one vaginal sex event[*]+[*]any other sex types, multiple vaginal sex events, any other sex types). Mixed-effect multinomial logistic regression modelled the influence of each sexual motivation on sexual behaviour type (Stata; all p[*]<[*] 0. 05). ‘No sex’ was the referent in all models; all models controlled for gender. Results: Participants contributed 14 [*] 856 total partner-associated diary entries. Most (54 %; women: 56. 5 %, men: 51. 2 %) were associated with no sex; when sex occurred, the most common behaviour type was one vaginal sex event (13. 1 %) for women and other sex types (16. 4 %) for men. <b>Wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> or perceiving a partner <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> were the strongest predictors of sexual behaviour type, and were associated with a greater number of reported sexual behaviours. Conclusions: Event-specific sexual motivations are associated with the choice <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex,</b> and with variation in the chosen sexual behaviours...|$|R

During the filming of the show, Ross said she used to watch Marshall and take notes on how to improve her own acting. In an interview with Soap Opera Digest, Ross criticized the decision to remove Marshall, and said, [...] "When you're an actress of her caliber and kind to everyone and plan Christmas parties and celebrate everyone's birthday and know your lines and are the most darling girl that ever breathed, of course you're going to be fired!" [...] Rodney Van Johnson, who portrayed T. C.

500|$|After the concert, Tammy {{and several}} other girls are invited backstage, where they think the Jonas Brothers <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with them. Instead, they {{convince}} the girls to wear purity rings as a pledge to abstinence, {{and tell them to}} get all of their friends to start wearing them as well because [...] "That is just the way we roll" [...] (a reference to one of their songs). To appease his girlfriend, Kenny reluctantly begins wearing a purity ring. As Kenny becomes dull as a result and ceases to spend time with his friends, it is revealed that the Jonas Brothers are being forced to wear and promote purity rings by their boss, Mickey Mouse. He is fearsome, greedy, sadistic, and foul-mouthed, and verbally berates and violently beats them when they complain that the rings are overshadowing their music and projecting the wrong message. Mickey explains that the rings allow him to sell sexual stimulation to young girls while giving the false appearance of innocence and purity. Concerned for their friend, Stan, Kyle, and Cartman attempt to confront the Jonas Brothers at a televised appearance in Denver; but Mickey, mistaking the boys for secret agents hired by DreamWorks (or Michael Eisner) to sabotage the televised appearance, tranquilizes them and takes them prisoner backstage.|$|E

2500|$|... "Rape {{victims are}} blamed more when they resist the attack {{later in the}} rape {{encounter}} rather than earlier (Kopper, 1996), which seems to suggest the stereotype that these women are engaging in token resistance (Malamuth & Brown, 1994; Muehlenhard & Rogers, 1998) or leading the man on because they have gone along with the sexual experience thus far. Finally, rape victims are blamed more when they are raped by an acquaintance or a date rather than by a stranger (e.g., Bell, Kuriloff, & Lottes, 1994; Bridges, 1991; Bridges & McGr ail, 1989; Check & Malamuth, 1983; Kanekar, Shaherwalla, Franco, Kunju, & Pinto, 1991; L'Armand & Pepitone, 1982; Tetreault & Barnett, 1987), which seems to evoke the stereotype that victims really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> because they know their attacker and perhaps even went {{out on a date}} with him. The underlying message of this research seems to be that when certain stereotypical elements of rape are in place, rape victims are prone to being blamed." ...|$|E
