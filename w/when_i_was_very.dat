500|$|Ellis {{admitted}} {{not being}} {{very familiar with}} the character, saying: [...] "All I remember of the Norman Osborn character was from the Spider-Man reprints my parents used to buy me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> young, and Norman Osborn was this guy with a weird rippled crewcut who was always sweating {{and his eyes were}} always bulging out of his head. That guy as a Donald Rumsfeld-like public governmental figure... talked me into writing the book while I was still laughing."" ...|$|E

She once attended a Catholic school, {{though she was}} raised as a Buddhist. She has recalled some portions of her childhood as [...] "painful", explaining that [...] "I loved my father very much and I only got to see him during the school holidays. But I {{think it was an}} advantage that they split up <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> young, so I could get used to it." [...] She visited her father in Falsterbo, Sweden, during school breaks and talked to him regularly over the phone. She cites her parents as [...] "supportive, positive influences" [...] in her life.|$|E
2500|$|Parker was {{inspired}} to take up various creative endeavours at a young age, [...] "I used to draw a lot <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> young, and I used {{to get the most}} immense feeling of satisfaction from finishing a picture and looking back at it, even though I wasn't actually that good. When I started playing music I got the same feeling from making a song, even if it was just a few noises or drum patterns put together. It was all about the buzz from making something from nothing. Music always affected me greatly as a listener anyway, usually from listening to music in my dad's car or listening to him play guitar." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{accidental}} {{death of her}} only brother, Michael (1911–1932), made Carte the heir to her father's hotel and theatre interests. [...] As a child, however, she had been reluctant to assume the family legacy. [...] She later told The Gramophone magazine: [...] "At home, you know, we weren't allowed to hum Gilbert and Sullivan; in fact we were fined for it, because it annoyed my father. We were allowed to sing it properly, but my brother and I couldn't – in my family the fact that I wasn't Mozart at about three years old was thought of as rather disappointing. So I went through a phase <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> anti-Gilbert and Sullivan; I became rather a highbrow, and my father thought I {{was a bit of}} a snake-in-the-grass because of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following his win at the Brands Hatch {{meeting of}} the 2007 World Touring Car Championship season, Andy Priaulx {{dedicated}} it to McRae, commenting that his death [...] "shows how fragile life can be". McRae's former rival, four-time World Rally Champion Tommi Mäkinen commented the helicopter accident as terrifying news, and described McRae as [...] "a pleasant fellow and a tough rival". Valentino Rossi, who was taught the basics of driving a rally car by McRae, said he was shocked and saddened by the sudden departure of the former World Rally Champion. Valentino dedicated his win at Estoril MotoGp in 2007 to Colin McRae saying to the media [...] "I want to dedicate this to Colin McRae. He {{was one of my}} big idols <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> young and it's because of him I have a big passion for rally".|$|E
2500|$|Return of the Jedi, {{the final}} {{film in the}} {{original}} trilogy, alludes to the character. While in the Ewok village on the forest moon of Endor, Luke Skywalker asked if Leia Organa remembers their [...] "real mother". Leia answers that [...] "she died <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> young" [...] and also says that [...] "she was very beautiful... kind... but sad" [...] while Luke confesses to have no memories of their mother. In an extended scene of Return of the Jedi, when Obi-Wan Kenobi talks to Luke he explains in detail {{what happened to his}} mother. It differs from the prequels in that Luke and Leia's mother snuck away as a handmaiden of Bail Organa and was with Leia until the Princess turned four, making the line Leia says to Luke about remembering their mother more believable.|$|E

60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> ill indeed, <b>I</b> {{can read}} Scott's novels, {{and they are}} almost the only books I can then read. I cannot at such times read the Bible; my mind {{reflects}} on it, but I can't bear the open page.|$|R

6000|$|... "Then {{you must}} {{remember}} several things. At first, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> humble and apologetic, you {{made it easier for}} me by saying that you could only condemn my conduct on the ground of being socially unwise. Remember?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, the Whiskered Friskers {{are really}} very clever," [...] he replied. [...] "I shall hate {{to part with}} them when I go away, for they have often amused me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> miserable. I wonder if you would ask Glinda--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{answered}} the monk rapturously; [...] "so happy that I should be content never to leave San Lazzaro.

6000|$|... "I {{suppose there}} is nothing {{medicinal}} in it?" [...] said Bastin.

6000|$|... "The orchard doesn't {{seem the}} same place by {{moonlight}} at all," [...] said the Story Girl dreamily.

6000|$|... 'Yes, {{it was not}} all darkness.
