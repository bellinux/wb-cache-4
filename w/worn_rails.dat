40|$|The {{prediction}} of wheel wear {{is a significant}} issue in railway vehicles.

However, the {{prediction of}} wheel and <b>rail</b> <b>wear</b> is still a great challenge for railway systems. Therefore, the main aim of this thesis is to develop a method for predicting wheel wear using artificial neural networks. Initial tests were carried out using a pin-on-disc machine and this data was used to establish how wear can be measured using an Alicona profilometer. A new method has been developed for detailed wheel <b>wear</b> and <b>rail</b> <b>wear</b> measurements using ‘Replica’ material which was applied to the wheel and rail surfaces of the test rig to make a copy of both surfaces. The replica samples were scanned using an optical profilometer and the results were processed to establish wheel <b>wear</b> and <b>rail</b> <b>wear.</b> The effect of load, and yaw angle on wheel <b>wear</b> and <b>rail</b> <b>wear</b> were examined. The effect of dry, wet, lubricated, and sanded conditions on wheel <b>wear</b> and <b>rail</b> <b>wear</b> were also investigated. A Nonlinear Autoregressive model with eXogenous input neural network (NARXNN) was developed to predict the wheel and <b>rail</b> <b>wear</b> for the twin disc rig experiments. The NARXNN was used to predict wheel <b>wear</b> and <b>rail</b> <b>wear</b> under deferent surface conditions such as dry, wet, lubricated, and sanded conditions. The neural network model was developed to predict wheel wear in case of changing parameters such as speed and suspension parameters. VAMPIRE vehicle dynamic software was used to produce the vehicle performance data to train, validate, and test the neural network. Three types of neural network were developed to predict the wheel wear: NARXNN, backpropagation neural network (BPNN), and radial basis function neural network (RBFNN). The wheel wear was calculated using an energy dissipation approach and contact position on straight track. The work is focused on wheel wear and the neural network prediction of <b>rail</b> <b>wear</b> was only carried out in connection with the twin disk wear tests. This thesis examines the effect of neural network parameters such as spread, goal, maximum number of neurons, and number of neurons to add between displays on wheel wear prediction. The neural network simulation results were implemented using the Matlab program. The percentage error for wheel and <b>rail</b> <b>wear</b> prediction was calculated. Also, the accuracy of wheel and <b>rail</b> <b>wear</b> prediction using the neural network was investigated and assessed in terms of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).

40|$|Abstract. The {{recognition}} of surface damage on rails is {{of critical importance}} in order to guarantee {{a high level of}} safety for normal train operation. Without early recognition systems, defect damage (e. g. cracks) in the rail, will increase in size and can eventually lead to fracture of the rail. Special grinding trains are in general use for rail maintenance and are employed to machine down <b>worn</b> <b>rails</b> and prevent surface damage in an early stadium. The company SPENO INTERNATIONAL SA along with the BAM, DB AG and other partners have integrated an eddy current instrument into a grinding train. The equipment has been developed for detection of Head Check type defects and provides information on defect position and depth. Initial experiments were presented at the DACH-conference 2004 in Salzburg [1]. This system has been continually developed and as will be shown is ready for practical application. It is named HC Grinding Scanner. The actual measuring system and results will be presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{investigate}} the possible causes of wheel squeal on Roslagsbanan, a narrow gauge (891 mm) suburban railway system in Stockholm, Sweden. Simulation of the dynamic behaviour of vehicles negotiating curves {{was carried out by}} means of the Swedish multibody simulation software GENSYS [1]. Wheel squeal may arise due to insufficient radial steering capability of the vehicles in curves causing too high levels of creep (relative sliding) in the wheel/rail-contact. Based on this theory, an advanced model of the creep-creep force relation was introduced. In this model the creep force decreases after creep reaches a certain level, called critical creep. It is believed that wheel squeal occurs after the creep level exceeded the critical creep value. Measured rail profiles of the curve together with measured wheel profiles were used as wheel/rail geometry input data. Other interesting parameters for the simulations, such as friction coefficient, primary suspension stiffness and damping, vehicle speed, braking/acceleration were varied and their effects on the outcome were tested. Worn wheels on newly grinded and <b>worn</b> <b>rails</b> under dry conditions are most likely to generate curve squeal. We believe the long term solution for Roslagsbanan is to grind the rail profiles into a shape more similar to the 50 E 3 with inclination 1 / 40. This will give a more even wheel wear over the whole wheel surface. However, curves below ca 300 m cannot be negotiated without wheel squeal, why all curves on the track tighter than ca 300 m have to be lubricated...|$|E
40|$|In 2011, UK {{heritage}} railways carried 7. {{1 million}} passengers on over 530 miles of track, accounting for £ 92 million of direct revenue. Much {{of this operation}} uses steam locomotives with relatively high axle loads and reciprocating motion {{which can lead to}} uneven track loading. However the majority of track components on heritage lines are antiquated due to reliance on cascaded components and in some cases on the deliberate retention of chaired bullhead rail for conservational purposes. This research provides an assessment of current methodologies regarding the management of steel rails on heritage railways: the measurement of rail wear, the assessment of the residual strength in <b>worn</b> <b>rails</b> and the subsequent determination of a rail’s critical wear limit. It describes the effectiveness and adequacy of some of the inspection regimes in use and addresses the risks associated with the variation in these regimes across the sector. A survey of permanent way supervisors on UK standard gauge heritage lines is reported and the permanent way in use is and the perceived requirements for its renewal are summarised. Due to low speeds and traffic levels, the main line standards for rail wear are generally thought to be inappropriate for heritage railway use whilst ‘high-tech’ methods for measuring crack propagation and rail wear are inaccessible due to cost. A common approach is to employ inspection and maintenance regimes developed by British Rail for use on rural lines. Utilising a fracture mechanics approach to predicting rail failure developed in the USA, the research highlights a more relevant set of guidelines, providing a matrix detailing acceptable wear limits based on inspection frequency, rail type, formation condition and traffic levels. The findings will benefit the heritage rail industry by minimising risk whilst accounting for resource limitations...|$|E

50|$|A railgrinder (or rail grinder) is a {{maintenance}} of way vehicle or train used {{to restore the}} profile and remove irregularities from <b>worn</b> <b>rail</b> track to extend its life and to improve the ride of trains using the track. Rail grinders were developed to increase the lifespan of the tracks being serviced for rail corrugation. Rail grinding {{is a process that}} is done to stop the deformation due to use and friction on railroad tracks by removing deformations and corrosion. Railroad tracks that experience continual use are more likely to experience corrugation and overall <b>wear.</b> <b>Rail</b> grinders are used to grind the tracks when rail corrugation is present, or before corrugation begins to form on the tracks. Major freight train tracks use rail grinder to maintenance based the interval of tonnage rather than time. Transit systems and subways in major cities continue to use scheduled rail grinding processes to combat the corrugation common to heavily used tracks. Rail-grinding equipment may be mounted on a single self-propelled vehicle or on a dedicated rail-grinding train which, when used on an extensive network, may include crew quarters. The grinding wheels, of which there may be more than 100, are set at controlled angles to restore the track to its correct profile.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} is to {{increase}} understanding of the relationship between RCF cracking and plastic deformation of the pearlitic microstructure. Following a multi-technical and multi-scale characterization of the <b>worn</b> <b>rail</b> surface, the multidirectional gradient of mechanical properties below the running band is studied with a microstructural point of view. In order to achieve the characterization of the running band and to quantify the influence of the microstructural/mechanical gradient on the global fatigue behavior, this experimental methodology has been based on the combination of several microstructural investigations by optical and scanning electron microscopy (FEG-SEM) in both rolling and transverse directions, microindentation performed on the gradient profile and determination of quantitative data on the pearlitic aggregates through the gradient by Electron backscatter Diffraction (EBSD). Due to the severe plastic deformation, material experiences progressively work hardening and the pearlitic microstructure is modified. In the middle of the running band where the contact patch envelope is more frequent, the pearlitic colonies below the <b>worn</b> <b>rail</b> surface are fractured by accumulation of cyclic and severe shear strain. The resulting lamellar structure of ferrite and cementite is elongated and aligned in the direction of shear strain as the interlamellar spacing decreases. On the contrary, at both sides of the running band where the contact with wheel is rare, the surface is rougher, the pearlitic colonies remain unaffected and the lamellae are not oriented preferentially. The examination of the running band and the microstructure gradient by quantitative analysis will contribute to improve the modeling of rail failure by RCF by enabling to include microstructural data...|$|R

To limit these costs, one measure is to predict <b>rail</b> <b>wear</b> through wear simulations. The purpose with this work is to perform simulations of successive <b>rail</b> <b>wear</b> on the Swedish light rail line Tvärbanan in Stockholm, by means of the track-vehicle dynamics software GENSYS in combination with a wear calculation program developed in MATLAB. The simulation procedure is based on a methodology with a simulation set design, where the simulations to be performed are selected through a parametric study. The simulations include track-vehicle simulations, where the wheel-rail contact is modelled according to the Hertzian contact theory together with Kalker’s simplified theory (including the numerical algorithm FASTSIM). The results from the track-vehicle simulations serve as input to the wear calculations. When modelling <b>rail</b> <b>wear</b> Archard’s wear model has been used, including wear coefficients based on laboratory measurements. The measurements have been performed under dry conditions, so the wear coefficients under lubricated conditions (both natural and deliberate lubrication) are reduced by factors estimated by field observations. After the wear depth calculations the wear distribution is smoothed and the rail profile is updated. The simulation procedure continues with a new wear step as long as the desired tonnage is not attained. Four curves of Tvärbanan with different curve radii, ranging from 85 to 410 m, have beenstudied in this work. On three of the curves the high rail is deliberately lubricated, whereas no lubrication has been applied in the widest curve. The vehicle operating the light rail line is an articulated tram with two motor end bogies and one intermediate trailer bogie. The line was opened in August 1999 and extended in one direction one year later. Rail profile measurements have been carried out by SL since March 2002. The traffic tonnage at the selected sites from the opening of the line to the last measurement occasion (September 2004) is at most 8. 9 mega gross ton per track.

40|$|Abstract: Rail {{transportation}} plays a {{major role}} in the transportation sector of South Africa and many other countries of the world. Trains are locomotives and carriages that travel on rail tracks. The trains steer with the wheel flange against the inside vertical face of the rail head or crown. This steering action produces wear due to the friction between the two steel surfaces moving relative to one another. It is observed that wear at curves is severe due to the high lateral forces of the wheel flange bearing against the rail crown, with very undesirable economic consequences. This study investigated steel rail material degradation at play between the sliding and the rubbing surfaces of the wheel flange on track by characterising some <b>worn</b> <b>rail</b> samples from Mayfair, Johannesburg, South Africa, rail line, with the aim to gain a better understanding of their wear mechanism. Chemical composition analysis of steel rail sample was conducted. Hardness and tensile behaviour of steel rail were measured and calculated, respectively. Microstructure features of the <b>worn</b> <b>rail</b> samples were also examined, using the stereoscope, microscope, and the Scanning Electron Microscope. Topography and roughness test analyses were also conducted. It was discovered that the examined <b>worn</b> out <b>rail,</b> which was originally produced from high carbon steel with pearlites and ferrites microstructure, undergoes a micro-structural evolution to form martensitic structure over the years of usage and exposure to environmental conditions mostly at the surface of the rail, which tends to become brittle. Some welded particles were also found to be interlocked in between the surfaces of the rail, causing gradual degradation and breakdown of the rail. These were caused by pressure shock and impact forces between the movement of the rail and the wheel flange. Hardness tests carried out on the top surfaces of 429, 432 and 591 VHN readings of steel rail compared to that of the sub inner part of 359, 352 and 338 VHN readings of steel track, found the top-surface to be harder.
