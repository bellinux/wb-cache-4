5|$|Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti (Jon Polito) {{investigate}} the fatal shooting of a man, who was apparently killed for a $1.49 pen. Lewis believes {{there must be}} more to the story, refusing to believe a pen is worth killing for. When they search suspect Mitchell Forman's (Sal S. Koussa) apartment, they find thousands of pens, many of which line the walls like bizarre decorations. Lewis later finds Forman at the police station, where he originally planned to turn himself in, but instead <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> roof to commit suicide. Lewis lures Forman away from the ledge by enticing him with a beautiful golden pen, which belonged to Lewis' deceased grandmother. Forman is taken into custody. Later, Lewis still cannot believe someone would kill over a pen, but Gee (Yaphet Kotto) suggests it is no worse than killing over a car or woman. Lewis, determined not to develop such a strong attachment to a material item, gives his grandmother's pen to Felton (Daniel Baldwin).|$|E
5|$|On February 23, 1991, {{at about}} 8:23 PM, a fire {{began on the}} 22nd floor of the {{building}}. It was a Saturday night and {{there were only three}} people in the building at the time, an engineer and two security guards. Workers had been refinishing woodwork in a vacant office earlier in the day and workers left a pile of rags soaked in linseed oil on the floor. The linseed oil oxidized and generated enough heat to ignite the rags, which then set fire to other solvents nearby. Smoke detectors did not cover the entire floor {{and by the time the}} fire alarm went off the fire was already well established. After the fire alarm sounded in the building the engineer <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 22nd floor to investigate. When the elevator reached the 22nd floor the engineer found heavy smoke and heat that prevented him from reaching the elevator controls he needed to return to the lobby. The engineer escaped after radioing to a security guard in the lobby to recall the elevator using fire safety controls there. The second security guard was on the 30th floor when the alarm went off and used the stairwell to get to the ground floor.|$|E
25|$|There were delays by the British government, which <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Prime Minister Gordon Brown {{who insisted}} on {{personally}} reviewing the paperwork. An approved bidder was appointed in 2008, the Italian company Impregilo. The project was suspended in November 2008, because of financial pressures {{brought on by the}} financial crisis of 2007–2010.|$|E

25|$|Born in Barnsley, Yorkshire, McCarthy {{made his}} league debut for then-Fourth Division Barnsley on 20 August 1977 in a 4–0 win over Rochdale. He {{spent two years}} in the {{basement}} league, before the club won promotion. Two years later, the team again <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> (old) Division 2. A strong central defender, he was a virtual ever-present for his hometown club, but departed in December 1983 for fellow Division 2 club Manchester City.|$|E
25|$|He {{was educated}} at Eton College {{where he became}} a member of the {{football}} XI between 1864 and 1866, and captain in his final year.

25|$|Hero Cup was {{the first}} tournament to be {{broadcast}} live on a satellite channel, Star TV. Until the Hero Cup in 1993, state terrestrial broadcaster Doordarshan had a monopoly on broadcast of cricket matches in India.

25|$|Once Jesus, {{the prophet}} Elijah, and St. George {{were going through}} Georgia. When they became tired and hungry they stopped to dine. They saw a Georgian {{shepherd}} and decided {{to ask him to}} feed them. First, Elijah <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shepherd and asked him for a sheep. After the shepherd asked his identity Elijah said that, {{he was the one who}} sent him rain to get him a good profit from farming. The shepherd became angry at him and told him that he was the one who also sent thunderstorms, which destroyed the farms of poor widows. (After Elijah, Jesus and St. George attempt to get help and eventually succeed).|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the {{construction}} work continued on the planned route. To {{the east of}} the tunnel, the Hunters Point Avenue subway station <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> level of the Hunterspoint Avenue LIRR station. Immediately east of it was a ramp up to the elevated subway towards Queensboro Plaza. Hunters Point Avenue opened on February 15, 1916, and on November 5 of the same year, it was extended to Queensboro Plaza. Because of the lack of track connections {{to the rest of the}} IRT network, a provisional maintenance workshop was operated at the tunnel ramp until 1928. To the west, construction began in 1922. The tunnel was extended to Fifth Avenue on March 23, 1926, and Times Square on March 14, 1927.|$|E
25|$|In 1890 the Federal Government {{was asked}} {{simultaneously}} {{by the same}} contractor for a concession for the Zermatt-Gornergrat railway, and for a Zermatt-Matterhorn one. The Gornergrat railway was constructed, and has been working since 1899, {{but there has been}} no more talk of the other. The project essentially consisted of a line which <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Hörnli, and continued thence in a rectilinear tunnel about two kilometres long, built under the ridge, and issuing near the summit on the Zmutt side. Sixty years later in 1950, Italian engineer Count Dino Lora Totino planned a cable car on the Italian side from Breuil-Cervinia to the summit. But the Alpine Museum of Zermatt sent a protest letter with 90,000 signatures to the Italian government. The latter declared the Matterhorn a natural wonder worthy of protection and refused the concession to the engineer.|$|E
50|$|Both {{platforms}} have an unstaffed, same-level fare {{control area}} at their north ends.

25|$|In September 1967 Mendleson <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> University of Essex to read English Literature and American History. In May 1968 {{she went}} to Paris, {{to join in the}} student {{political}} rising; what she saw had a great effect on her political thinking. In 1969 she dropped out of her university course rather than continue into her final year, but remained living in Wivenhoe around the university for several months. In early 1970 she was living in York Way in the King's Cross area of London, and was a close friend of a group including some university friends who were living a semi-communal life in Stamford Hill; among them was Hilary Creek. Mendleson and Creek were supporting a group which had squatted empty flats in Arbour Square in Stepney. She became a friend of Jim Greenfield after meeting him on leaving a political meeting.|$|E
25|$|One {{afternoon}} in June, Bucey was returning from Tête Jaune Cache {{and had just}} passed the Grand Canyon when he spotted a white flag on the river bank. This {{was a sign that}} someone needed the sternwheeler to stop, either to take on cargo or passengers. The passengers turned out to be twenty burly railworkers with their paychecks in their pockets, all of whom {{were on their way to}} Fort George. In particular, South Fort George, where there was a licensed hotel, and a variety of other entertainments, where one could celebrate the end of another work week. However, when the purser approached the first of these men for his fare, the man obstinately refused to pay, even after the purser offered to cash his company paycheck. Fearing that if he let one get away without paying that none would pay, the purser <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pilot house and spoke to Captain Bucey.|$|E
25|$|In the {{original}} 1925 {{plan for the}} U.S. Highway System, US9 was designated along {{the west bank of}} the Hudson River from the New Jersey line to Albany, utilizing then-NY10. North of Albany, US9 mostly followed NY6 to Canada. The lone deviation was from Elizabethtown to Keeseville, where US9 was routed on a previously unnumbered highway to the east instead. NY6 east of the Hudson (up to Rensselaer) and a further extension to Glens Falls via Troy, Mechanicville, and Schuylerville was designated as US109. The alignment of US9 within New York remained unchanged in the final system alignment approved on November11, 1926. However, when US9 was commissioned in New York in 1927, the US109 designation had been dropped and was signed instead as US9E, but only up to Waterford. The segment on {{the west bank of the}} Hudson from New Jersey to Waterford was redesignated as US9W, with the split routes meeting in Waterford. From there, unsuffixed US9 began (still along NY6) and <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Canadian border via Rouses Point as planned in 1925.|$|E

25|$|Navajo scouts {{accompanied}} the United States Army when it investigated many civilian-Navajo confrontations. For example, between June 14 and September 28, 1883 {{there were five}} different Navajo reservation related activities. Lieutenant Parker, with ten enlisted men and two scouts, <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> San Juan River to separate Navajos and citizens who encroached on Navajo land. Lieutenant Guy, with seventeen enlisted men and two scouts, and Captain Smith, with 56 enlisted men and five scouts helped the local Indian agent deal with unhappy Navajo chiefs. This involved Manuelito, Torlino, Grando Muncho and fifty armed Navajos who were upset by raids of citizens and other tribes on their people and livestock. In another action: Lieutenant Lockett, with forty-two enlisted men, were joined by Lieutenant Holomon at Navajo Springs. Evidently a citizen named Houck and or Owens had murdered a Navajo chief's son and 100 armed Navajos were looking for them. It is evident from these four months of military reports from the field that the officers tended to trust the Navajo version of events.|$|E
25|$|Water {{was brought}} to the mill in an open ditch (zanja) from Los Robles and Kewen Canyons, and stored in a large cistern. For the mill itself, Father Zalvidea {{designed}} an unusual horizontal, direct impulse water wheel. There were three vaulted water chambers on the ground floor and a single horizontal water wheel. The water wheel was attached to a vertical shaft that <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> second level (the current entrance room) where the grinding stones were located. One of the grinding stones was attached to the shaft, and rotated along with the water wheel. A second stone was placed above the rotating stone, with corn and grain between the stones. It is suspected that the force of the water from the cistern was not sufficient to start the wheel turning with the required force, and that a leather thong was wrapped around the shaft and pulled by Indians to start the wheel. The upper-most room, used now as an art gallery, was used for storage of the final product. After the water flowed out of the mill, it was channeled into a lake down hill from the mill. The lake has since dried up and is now the site of San Marino's Lacy Park.|$|E
25|$|Douglas {{argued that}} the {{tabernacle}} ran horizontally toward the most sacred area, Mount Sinai went up vertically to the summit, and the sacrificial pile started with the head underneath and <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> entrails, and one can interpret each by reference to the others. Douglas noted that in mystical thought, “upper” and “inner” can be equivalent. The pattern is always there throughout creation, with God in the depths or on the heights of everything. Likening the tabernacle to a body, the innards corresponded to the Holy of Holies, for the Bible locates the emotions and thought in the innermost parts of the body; the loins are wrung with remorse or grief; God scrutinizes the innermost part; compassion resides in the bowels. The Tabernacle was associated with creation, and creation with fertility, implying that the innermost part of the Tabernacle was a Divine nuptial chamber, depicting the union between God and Israel. Douglas concluded that {{the summit of the}} mountain was the abode of God, below was the cloudy region that only Moses could enter, and the lower slopes were where the priests and congregation waited, and analogously, the order of placing the parts of the animal on the altar marked out three zones on the carcass, the suet set around and below the diaphragm corresponding to the cloud girdling the middle of the mountain.|$|E
