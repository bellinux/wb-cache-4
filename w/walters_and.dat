5|$|A few {{accounts}} {{exist that}} describe females defending their newborn litters. Wharten (1960, 1966) reported several cases where females found near their young stood their ground and considered these to be examples of guarding behavior.

When one of the young was moved a short distance from the chamber, she seemed to be agitated and faced the intruder. Eventually, all of her offspring retreated into the chamber, but the female remained at the entrance, ready to strike.|$|E
5|$|Headlam was {{promoted}} to substantive air commodore on 1January 1955. In November he was posted to RAAF Overseas Headquarters, London, and the following year undertook studies at the Imperial Defence College. Returning to Australia, he served as acting Air Member for Personnel at the Department of Air, Canberra, from 19March to 21October 1957, between the terms of Air Vice Marshals Fred Scherger and Allan <b>Walters,</b> <b>and</b> again from 24August 1959 to 28March 1960, between the terms of <b>Walters</b> <b>and</b> Air Vice Marshal Bill Hely. In this role Headlam occupied {{a seat on the}} Air Board, the service's controlling body that comprised its senior officers and was chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff. He was also one of two RAAF representatives to serve on a committee, chaired by businessman William John Allison, examining conditions of defence service; the committee's recommendations led to a doubling of flight pay, among other improvements. Headlam's other positions at the Department of Air included Air Commodore Plans from October 1957 to January 1959, and Director General Plans and Policy from January to August 1959. The latter assignment put him in charge of the RAAF's Directorate of Intelligence.

5|$|On May 18, 1979, the Hamilton Tiger-Cats traded Allemang and a {{draft pick}} to the Winnipeg Blue Bombers for linebacker Harry <b>Walters</b> <b>and</b> {{defensive}} end Jim Heighton. The retirement of the Buddy Brown left the Blue Bombers {{looking for an}} offensive guard, and they transitioned Allemang into this role {{on the right side}} of the offensive line. Allemang played in all 16 regular season games during the 1979 season, primarily on the offense. He returned to the defensive line in 1980 and alternated between the offense and defense for the remainder of his time with the Blue Bombers. In 1981, Allemang saw a reduced role, playing in only four games. After playing 36 total regular season games with the Blue Bombers, Allemang was cut in October 1981.|$|E
5|$|No.1 Wing {{was formed}} at RAAF Station Richmond on 7October 1942. Its initial {{commander}} was Group Captain Allan <b>Walters</b> <b>and</b> the wing leader was Wing Commander Clive Caldwell, Australia's top-scoring flying ace of the war. At {{this time the}} RAAF had received 71 tropicalised variants of the Spitfire Vc and another 33 were en route to Australia. These aircraft differed from the standard Spitfire Vc in that they were optimised for use in desert and tropical areas and had been fitted with a Vokes air filter beneath their nose {{to reduce the amount}} of sand and dust which entered the engine; Caldwell believed that this modification reduced the Spitfires' performance. As well as the three Spitfire squadrons, No.1 Wing also included No. 10 Mobile Fighter Sector Headquarters. Many of the squadrons' most experienced pilots were posted to other units before they departed Britain, and only 37 of the 95 pilots in the wing as at May 1943 had previously seen combat.|$|E
