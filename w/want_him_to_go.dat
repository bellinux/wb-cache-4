60|$|Fred had {{but little}} to tell {{out of the}} ordinary. His folks had <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the {{seashore}} for the summer, but he had preferred to take the houseboat trip with the Rovers.|$|R

"Since the {{economic}} {{value of the}} Pole for us is through the tilling of our farms, it is fortunate that the Pole himself likes the farm and shows himself ready to fall in with the plans already made for him.

In her memoirs Thatcher said she [...] "bitterly regretted" [...] losing a like-minded person from the Cabinet.|$|E
2500|$|Comedian Jeff Garlin accused NBC {{of being}} [...] "cheap", {{suggesting}} that the network tempted O'Brien with his dream job of hosting The Tonight Show {{because they did not}} <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to a competitor, but neither did they want to match what the competitors were offering. [...] Garlin did not consider Leno blameless and accused him of undermining O'Brien's incipient Tonight Show by taking the 10pm slot. [...] Garlin stated that while Leno had been nice to him over the years, the host displayed [...] "no character" [...] by taking the timeslot back. [...] Garlin vowed never to appear on Leno's Tonight Show thereafter.|$|E
60|$|Kit's heart beat. Olivia <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> far, {{and this}} implied much. He forgot Betty, and then looking up, saw Mrs. Austin {{and her husband}} on the steps.|$|R

60|$|She <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> London for a change, {{and without}} her, {{and his heart}} leaped into his mouth to prevent his saying No; yet he said it, though in the Tommy way.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked up}} to Skipper questioningly. Was it that Skipper <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> in after the wild-dog? But Skipper laughed and waved his hand {{to show that he}} <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> search in other places for {{something}} else.|$|R
60|$|I'm afraid you'll {{think it}} silly and vain {{of me to}} say so, but I think you should know that--that Ronny's in love with me. That is why I <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b>|$|E
6000|$|TWISDEN. Wait! We <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{straight}} off to Morocco. Don't upset him. [To COLFORD and MARGARET] I {{think you had}} better go. If, a little later, Margaret, you could go round to Mrs Dancy-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm not so {{sure that}} I do, father. It seems to me {{something}} like the Irishman's pig which you pull one way when you <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> another. However, I'll take your word for it." ...|$|E

It looks as if she told <b>him</b> <b>to</b> come in this mornin', and he's gone.

6000|$|... "Certainly, sir. I don't <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> I {{was only}} {{thinking}} {{it would be}} better for his children that there should be a change.

6000|$|... "We'll have a run {{out to the}} mesa," [...] {{said her}} brother, as he mounted. [...] "Keep a tight rein on him and ease up when you <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> faster.
