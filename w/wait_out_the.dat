5|$|As night approaches, the {{brothers}} {{have not been}} able to find Gordon. Dean decides to go after Gordon while Sam stays hidden, but Sam refuses. He then confronts Dean about his reckless behavior since his deal with a Crossroads Demon, which left him only a year to live. Dean claims that he is not scared of his impending death, but Sam challenges this. Dean eventually relents, agreeing to behave more like his old self again. The two then prepare to <b>wait</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> night.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{time was}} {{on the side of}} the defenders; most armies could not afford to <b>wait</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> {{prosecution}} of a siege, especially of a well-fortified, well-provisioned city. Until the invention of gunpowder-based weapons (and the resulting higher-velocity projectiles), the balance of power and logistics definitely favored the defender. With the introduction of large-caliber mortars and howitzers (in modern times), the traditional methods of defense became less effective against a determined siege, although many of the trace italienne fortresses presented a formidable challenge well into the twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|Although Portuguese by birth, Ferdinand Magellan {{transferred}} his {{allegiance to}} King Charles I of Spain, on whose behalf he left Seville on 10 August 1519, with {{a squadron of}} five ships, {{in search of a}} western route to the Spice Islands in the East Indies. Success depended on finding a strait or passage through the South American land masses, or finding the southern tip of the continent and sailing around it. The South American coast was sighted on 6 December 1519, and Magellan moved cautiously southward, following the coast to reach latitude 49°S on 31 March 1520. Little if anything was known of the coast south of this point, so Magellan decided to <b>wait</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> southern winter here, and established the settlement of Puerto San Julian.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{issuance}} of a hurricane warning in North Carolina on August17, mandatory evacuation orders were declared for the outermost islands in the state. Local police assisted significant traffic as an estimated 50,000 to 100,000 people left the region. At {{the height of the}} evacuations, delays in some places exceeded three hours. Despite the large number of evacuees, an additional 50,000 people were estimated to have stayed home and <b>wait</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> storm. Several bridges in the area were shut down prior to Bob's arrival as hurricane-force winds were likely to create life-threatening conditions on them. The National Park Service in the state also shut down campgrounds across the Outer Banks. An evacuation shelter was also opened in Carteret County.|$|E
5|$|In Mexico, tens of {{thousands}} of tourists and residents were evacuated from the beach resorts in and around Cancún, the Riviera Maya, and Cozumel. Hotel guests were evacuated on Saturday afternoon, and staff on Sunday afternoon. Though some hotel guests in second floor rooms and above were given the option to be bussed into the center of Cancun to safe houses and shelters or to stay and <b>wait</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> storm in only the modern built hotels and resorts. Most of the remaining guests were restricted to their rooms and were not allowed out on the beach areas. No alcohol was sold in Cancun for 36hours prior to the arrival of the storm, in an attempt to avoid drunken tourists being injured during the night. Two helicopter pilots were killed when their aircraft crashed while evacuating offshore oil platforms operated by Pemex. A German resident was electrocuted while on his roof in Playa del Carmen.|$|E
5|$|The initial Abbasid {{invasion}} {{was led by}} Ishaq ibn Kundaj, {{appointed as}} the nominal governor of Syria and Egypt, and another general, Muhammad ibn Diwdad Abu'l-Saj. After receiving encouragement from al-Muwaffaq, who promised to send them reinforcements, the two commanders marched into Syria in mid-884. The Tulunid governor of Damascus soon defected to their side, {{and they were able}} to take control of Antioch, Hims and Aleppo. Upon learning of the Abbasid advance, Khumarawayh sent troops to Syria. The Tulunid army first proceeded to Damascus, where they succeeded in forcing its rebel governor to flee, and then advanced to Shayzar on the Orontes. The onset of winter, however, resulted in a lull in hostilities, and both sides remained in their camps to <b>wait</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> season.|$|E
50|$|The Romans {{destroyed}} the Jewish {{community of the}} Church in Jerusalem, which had existed {{since the time of}} Jesus. Traditionally it is believed <b>the</b> Jerusalem Christians <b>waited</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> Jewish-Roman wars in Pella in the Decapolis.|$|R
50|$|After that, the {{division}} moved to Louisville, Kentucky, {{where it was}} in action from November 24 to December 2. From there, the 10th moved to Elizabethtown {{and then on to}} Bacon Creek on December 26, where it <b>waited</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> winter.|$|R

5|$|Twelve {{days out}} of Delaware Bay, Bonnet entered the estuary of the Cape Fear River and {{anchored}} {{near the mouth of}} a small waterway now known as Bonnet's Creek. The Royal James had begun to leak badly and was in need of careening. Shortly afterwards, a small shallop entered the river and was captured. Bonnet had the shallop broken up to help repair the Royal James. The work of careening was done, in whole or in part, by the prisoners Bonnet had captured. Bonnet threatened at least one man with marooning if he did not work with the slaves to repair the Royal James. Bonnet remained in the Cape Fear River for the next 45 days. According to Bonnet's boatswain, Ignatius Pell, the pirates intended to <b>wait</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> hurricane season there.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{broken and}} {{incoherent}} radio messages between Lieber {{and the search}} party are intercepted by intelligence agents tracking their progress, and rumours begin to spread across the world of Hitler's capture. Debates flare up over his impending trial, {{where it will be}} held and under whose jurisdiction. Orosso is identified as the nearest airfield to the last known location of the search party, and aircraft begin arriving at the hitherto unknown town. But when the search party loses radio contact with Lieber, they must make a decision to either <b>wait</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> storms and deliver their captive to Lieber later, or try Hitler in the jungle. They choose the latter, given that they would likely lose control of the situation if they attempted to transport their prisoner. Against Lieber's advice ("You must not let him speak... his tongue is like no other") they prepare for a trial with a judge, prosecution and defence attorneys selected from the members of the search party. Teku, a local Indian tracker, is asked to observe the trial as an independent witness.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{individuals}} in a colony varies. A mature nest of several years old can hold between 11,000 and 64,000 ants, while other colonies can house around 300,000. In some cases, enormous colonies can {{have as many as}} a million ants. Observed colonies are known to contain nearly 70,000 larvae and 64,000 workers; some can have 20,000 males and over 1,000 virgin queens, but others may have more virgin queens than males. The ratio of worker ants to the number of the larvae in colonies ranges from one worker for every two larvae or two larvae for every worker. The population of a nest can be affected or altered by several factors: human interference can severely damage or completely destroy nests which potentially devastates the nest population, and overshadowing is the main cause of a nest's demise. As well as that, neighbouring nests may increase in population if damaged or abandoned sites are taken over. Meat ants also rely on their nests to withstand climatic stress in summer and winter, as foraging activity and food sources are sometimes limited in summer, and in winter plant growth is almost impossible and workers are unable to survive cold temperatures. As a result, meat ants overwinter, which is a process where some organisms <b>wait</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> winter season due to cold conditions making everyday activity and survivability almost impossible; populations may be affected greatly.|$|E
50|$|The storm {{also points}} <b>out</b> <b>the</b> direct issues with {{marriage}} at the time. Calixta appears lonely and depressed {{in the beginning}} of the story, but by the time Bobinot comes home from <b>waiting</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> storm, she receives a can of shrimps upon arrival and by this small gesture a marriage could be rekindled.|$|R
50|$|With both American {{strategic}} and tactical air power arriving in force, F-80 Shooting Stars and F-51 Mustangs closed most rail and road traffic by day, and destroyed 32 critical bridges {{necessary for the}} conduct of warfare.

25|$|Polistes instabilis can {{be found}} in {{tropical}} and subtropical areas. These include Central and South America, specifically Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica. Those found in Costa Rica tend to live in the lowlands, in dry forested areas. Once the rainy season ends in December, individuals migrate to higher elevation to <b>wait</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> winter.|$|E
25|$|The forests also {{concealed}} family camps where Jewish escapees from camps or ghettos, many of {{whom were}} too young or too old to fight, hoped to <b>wait</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> war. While some partisan groups required combat readiness and weapons as a condition for joining, many noncombatants found shelter with Jewish fighting groups and their allies. These individuals and families contributed to the welfare of the group by working as craftsmen, cooks, seamstresses and field medics.|$|E
25|$|The {{second season}} of the Israeli version {{introduced}} a different format for the Yield and U-Turn. Unlike the original format, each team would have to vote sometime during the leg for the team they wish to Yield and {{the team with the}} most votes is forced to <b>wait</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> Yield at a certain point later in the Leg. Because of this, the limit of the number of times a team can Yield was removed.|$|E
50|$|Concerned about {{costs and}} enforcement, the Nixon and Ford Administrations {{attempted}} to stall the regulations both by rewriting them {{and calling for}} further study regarding their impact if they did stay in their present form.

50|$|As an {{unlikely}} hero, Mullen {{admits that he}} was not motivated by bravery, anger, or fear, but by homesickness for Earth (specifically his hometown, Richmond, Virginia), where he has not returned for 17 years, and that he could not face <b>the</b> prospect of <b>waiting</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> war in captivity when on the cusp of returning home.|$|R
50|$|In March 1945, the 38th {{returned}} to Hawaii {{on the popular}} but mistaken rumor that {{it was to be}} reequipped with B-32 Dominators. Instead, many of the crews and planes were reassigned to the 11th Bombardment Group and subsequently served with it. <b>The</b> remaining elements <b>waited</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> war conducting training sorties and routine patrols. Inactivated on 20 March 1946.|$|R
25|$|Orr {{attempts}} {{to escape the}} war in two main ways. His first {{goal is to get}} a whore to knock him unconscious, so that he can be grounded. When this fails, Orr plans to crash land in the sea and make his way to a neutral country where he can <b>wait</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> war. Orr practices this second goal by getting shot down every mission he flies, and so becomes an expert in crash landings, without losing a single crewman.|$|E
25|$|On 19 October 1819, Topaze {{arrived at}} Mauritius from Ceylon {{with a number}} of crew ill from an unknown disease {{resembling}} cholera. The local authorities permitted the crew to land and the landing of the ill, bypassing quarantine. By 18 November the disease had spread to the local population. The locals deserted Port Louis and demanded that Topaze sail for the Seychelles to <b>wait</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> storm season there. Lumley initially refused, but by January assented. Topaze returned to Mauritius in April, and was put into quarantine, though the epidemic had passed, and there was repaired and thoroughly disinfected.|$|E
25|$|Still not {{satisfied}} with her revenge, Ní Mháille then sailed for Ballycroy and attacked the garrison at Doona Castle, overpowering the defenders and taking the castle for herself. Her attack against the MacMahons {{was not the first}} time she interrupted someone at their prayers. Legend tells of another lord who stole property from her and fled to a church for sanctuary. She was determined to <b>wait</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> thief, maintaining that he could starve or surrender. The thief dug a tunnel and escaped, however, and the hermit who took care of the church broke his vow of silence to scold her for attempting to harm someone who had sought sanctuary. Her reply is not recorded.|$|E

25|$|Bangladesh won the toss in {{the first}} of three matches, and under cloudy skies they chose to bowl first, putting faith in his newly {{composed}} seam bowling attack of Tapash Baisya and Syed Rasel with the new ball. However, the pair leaked runs during the first eight overs, and the score was 51 for 0 when Baisya ran in to bowl his fifth over of the day and Bangladesh's ninth. However, Sanath Jayasuriya was bowled by an inswinging delivery from Baisya for 25, and that slowed Sri Lanka down. Baisya even bowled a maiden over as the Sri Lankans chose to <b>wait</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> middle overs and set the platform for big hitting at the end - which worked perfectly.|$|E
25|$|The Beatles' {{flight to}} Tokyo stopped in Anchorage, Alaska late on 27 June, local time, and was {{grounded}} there {{due to the}} presence of a typhoon over Japan. Epstein arranged for the Beatles to <b>wait</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> delay at Anchorage's Westward Hotel, where the band's presence instantly attracted a crowd of local fans, who serenaded them from the street below. The flight finally arrived at Haneda Airport in Tokyo {{in the early hours of}} 29 June, according to a report by Dudley Cheke, a chargé d'affaires at the British Embassy. Alternatively, an arrival time of around 3.30 am on 30 June is given by Beatles biographers Barry Miles and John Winn and in a 2016 Tokyo Weekender article about the visit.|$|E
25|$|The next day, Balao {{investigated}} smoke on the horizon, {{found two}} cargo ships, tracked {{them through a}} rain squall, and as she passed into clear weather, found the convoy in perfect position for her torpedoes. She fired four stern tubes at the leading ship, but heard no explosions. The torpedoes were duds or had again passed underneath. As the escorts actively pursued the submarine, Balao submerged to <b>wait</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> inevitable depth charges. When the submarine surfaced again, all trace of the convoy was gone, and she set course for Langemak Bay, New Guinea, with all her torpedoes expended. On 7 March, Balao moored alongside Coucal and took on fuel and provisions. She got underway again on the following morning, bound for Pearl Harbor where she arrived for refit on 19 March.|$|E
