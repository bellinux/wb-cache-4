Synchronous spawning events sometimes occurs even with these species. After fertilization, the corals release planula that are ready to settle.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Iniki's {{high winds}} caused {{extensive}} damage in Kauai. 1,421houses were destroyed, and 63 were lost {{from the storm}} surge and <b>wave</b> <b>action.</b> A total of 5,152homes were severely damaged, while 7,178 received minor damage. On the south coast, hotels and condominiums received severe damage as well. A few were restored quickly, though some took several years to be rebuilt. One hotel—the Coco Palms Resort famous for Elvis Presley's Blue Hawaii—never reopened after the hurricane.|$|E

5|$|The cliffs on {{the ocean}} side of the {{peninsula}} are sheer and are undergoing constant erosion due to <b>wave</b> <b>action.</b> On the east side the land slopes into San Diego Bay more gradually, so that homes and developments {{go right to the}} water's edge. At the northern end of the peninsula the cliffs and hills become lower, disappearing entirely in Ocean Beach and the Midway area, where the San Diego River flows.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{produced}} heavy surf {{along the}} western coastline, {{as well as a}} storm tide of 4.78feet (1.46m) at Clearwater Beach. The <b>wave</b> <b>action</b> caused minor beach erosion, with 50–60feet (15–18m) of sand washed away at Bradenton Beach. The increased ocean action caused minor flooding along several roads in the Tampa Bay area, which trapped some automobile travelers. At Indian Shores, a woman died after sustaining injuries from the rough surf.|$|E
5|$|As a Postelsia alga grows, its stipe thickens in {{the same}} manner as a tree's trunk. The cells beneath the epidermis, called the meristoderm, divide rapidly to form rings of growth, again, like a tree. However, the greater {{flexibility}} of Postelsia stipe over that of a woody tree makes for some distinct differences. Postelsia must be thicker than a tree of equal height in order to support itself. However, the stipe is very much more suited to the coastal habitat, as it allows the seaweed to bend with the constant <b>wave</b> <b>action.</b> Such an environment would cause the inflexible, woody tree to break.|$|E
40|$|An {{offshore}} breakwater {{is designed}} {{for the construction of}} a LNG-terminal. For the slope stability analysis of the rubble mound breakwater the existing and the extreme wave climate are considered. Pore water pressure variations exist in the breakwater and its permeable foundation. A wave trough combined with the moment of maximum wave run-up results in a decrease and increase of the pore water pressure, respectively. Therefore, the <b>wave</b> <b>actions</b> have on overall effect on the slope stability of the breakwater. To include the <b>wave</b> <b>actions</b> in the slope stability analysis a simplified method is used. For the slope stability analysis, a specific piezometric line is determined. This piezometric line consists of a wave profile and the profile of wave run-up. The slope stability analysis are performed with GEO-SLOPE/W 2007. For the geotechnical design of the breakwater load cases of extreme and normal waves combined with, respectively, extreme and normal water levels are analysed. All the load cases which included the <b>wave</b> <b>actions</b> result in lower stability safety factors than the load cases with only still water levels. Therefore the <b>wave</b> <b>actions</b> are the determining load case for the geotechnical stability of the breakwater and it should be studied in detail...|$|R

5|$|Moderate <b>wave</b> <b>action</b> {{produced}} severe beach erosion {{along the}} shore of Baltimore County at a loss of $3million (2003USD, ($ USD)). Residential areas of Millers Island, Edgemere, North Point, Bowleys Quarters and Turners Station suffered severe damage from the hurricane, with over 400people needing to be rescued. Over 300buildings were destroyed. The storm surge flooding killed a man in Dundalk, and either destroyed or greatly damaged most marinas. Strong winds downed 118trees on school grounds and hundreds of others elsewhere, some of which fell on power lines which resulted in leaving 220,000customers without power. The passage of Hurricane Isabel left 3,189tons (2,893t) of debris across the county.|$|E
5|$|On {{the island}} of Barbados, {{sustained}} winds peaked at 69mph (112km/h) while gusts reached 92mph (149km/h), which damaged many trees and roofs. A total of 531houses were damaged, of which 43 were completely destroyed. Additionally, four hotels sustained some damage. The winds left most of island without electricity, though officials worked quickly to restore the power. Rainfall from the storm was light, with less than 1inch (25mm) in most areas. Storm surge and <b>wave</b> <b>action</b> caused beach erosion that severely damaged most coastal roads. One death was reported on the island, and damage was estimated at more than $5million (2004USD, ($ USD).|$|E
5|$|Presque Isle is a recurved, sand spit {{that formed}} {{during the last}} glacial period, or ice age, when the Laurentide Ice Sheet {{advanced}} into the basin now occupied by Lake Erie, and, when it retreated to the north between 12,370BC and 12,790BC, left behind a moraine consisting of clay, sand, and gravel that initially formed the Presque Isle peninsula.

5|$|Subtropical Storm Alpha (also called Alfa) {{was a rare}} {{off-season}} subtropical cyclone {{that hit}} Georgia in May 1972. It developed from a previously non-tropical cyclone in the western Atlantic Ocean, and initially it moved northeastward off the Carolinas. The storm turned southwestward due to a building ridge, and concurrently it intensified to become Subtropical Storm Alpha. It later moved ashore near Savannah, and it finally dissipated in the northeast Gulf of Mexico on May 29. It produced <b>wave</b> <b>action</b> and moderate rainfall along the coast. Damage totaled over $100,000 (1972USD), {{and there were two}} associated deaths.|$|E
5|$|The {{storm was}} {{expected}} to impact operations regarding the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill, with both containment and cleanup operations being affected by repercussions from the storm (such as <b>wave</b> <b>action</b> and wind direction). Although Alex stayed relatively away from the site, the storm caused BP to delay plans to increase oil capture from the leak by a week. Tarballs from the spill as large as apples washed onshore around Grand Isle, {{as well as other}} parts of Louisiana, Alabama and Florida, from high storm tides created by the hurricane.|$|E

5|$|Dot {{produced}} {{heavy rainfall}} and gusty winds {{as it passed}} south of the Big Island, Lanai, Maui, Molokai, and Oahu, resulting in minor damage. In Oahu, some homes along the coast were unroofed, and damage from <b>wave</b> <b>action</b> was also reported. Damage from these four islands totaled US$150,000, and two indirect deaths occurred in Lanai. Extensive damage occurred on Kauai as Dot made landfall, producing wind gusts as high as 103mph (166km/h) and toppling trees and power lines. Widespread power outages affected the island, causing telecommunications and water systems to fail. Although infrastructure was damaged to an extent by floodwater and strong winds, crops suffered the most losses. Cane sugar crops sustained US$2.7million in losses. Overall, damage from Dot across Hawaii totaled US$6million, and a disaster area declaration and state of emergency took effect for the archipelago after the hurricane's passage.|$|E
5|$|Hardee County saw {{property}} damage estimated at $750million, along with six injuries, but no deaths were reported. Charley caused blackouts {{in the entire}} county, as well as damage to3,600homes and the destruction of1,400. A radio tower near Sebring was toppled, along with numerous trees and power poles along {{the north and east}} side of Highlands County. Additionally, there were several reports of severely damaged homes in Polk County near Babson Park and Avon Park. In Lake Wales, Florida, a sand mine lake encroached into State Road 60 due to <b>wave</b> <b>action</b> and swallowed a car. Additionally, Lake Wales saw 23,000buildings damaged, as well as the destruction of 739structures. Seven deaths were reported in the county, one of them determined to be direct.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Juan's maximum {{sustained}} {{wind speed}} at landfall in Nova Scotia was measured at 100mph (155km/h). The urban concentration surrounding Halifax Harbour bore {{the brunt of}} the highest sustained winds and strongest wind gusts during the storm; some unofficial estimates have placed gusts as high as 145mph (230km/h). Wave-rider weather buoys off the entrance of Halifax Harbour snapped their moorings after reportedly recording waves in excess of 65ft (20m). Significant erosion occurred on the populated shores of the harbour, particularly in the Bedford Basin where residential properties and railway tracks received most of the <b>wave</b> <b>action.</b> Storm surges of 5 to 7feet (1.5 to 2m) were reported in the harbour; it was the highest surge ever recorded in Halifax Harbour. Rainfall was fairly light due to the fast movement and dry air on the southern side of the storm. There were no rainfall reports greater than 2inches (52mm).|$|E
40|$|Estuaries in the Niger Delta-Nigeria are {{influenced}} by tidal currents and <b>wave</b> <b>actions</b> due to their proximity to the Atlantic Ocean. Tidal current provides the energy required to move sediments {{in and out of}} the estuaries from the seashores, while <b>wave</b> <b>actions</b> curtails the deposition of sediments at the bottom of the estuaries as the bed get shallower, resulting in the modification and long-term regulation of siltation through erosion or accretion. The interaction between estuaries bathymetric shapes, tidal currents and <b>wave</b> <b>actions</b> can only be fully understood through analytical or mathematical relationships. Analytical methods are less accurate in predicting future tides, while none of the existing mathematical relationships can accurately predict tidal behavior in the Niger Delta region due to the fact that parameters governing tidal actions vary from region to region, hence the need for this study. This study shows the behavior of the estuaries in response to variation in tidal heights, currents and <b>wave</b> <b>actions</b> through mathematical modeling, a knowledge which is useful in planning and timing of marine activities that requires pre-knowledge of tidal levels, direction and current velocities. The models were formulated and calibrated using parameters generated from the hydrographic, hydraulics and geotechnical investigation, including local field observations and measurements conducted within the study area. Soil samples taken from the area are composed of peat, organic clays, silty clays and sand. Peat constitutes the dominant soil which is locally known as 'chikoko' with high compressibility and color ranging from dark brown to dark gray and texture from soft to firm. Typical bed material size (D 50) is approximately 0. 2 mm. Tides in the region are mostly semidiurnal with tidal prism ranging from 0. 4 to 1. 5 m. The tidal strength is strongest at the inlets and decreases with distance inland. The depth of the estuaries is controlled by the strength of the tidal currents. Areas very close to the ocean with stronger tidal effect are very deep; while shallow canals and creeks predominates the hub of the estuaries. The results obtained using the present models compared favorably with the field measurements. Average correlation coefficients of 0. 9 were obtained in some cases. The results showed that the estuaries erodes, accretes, or remain stable, depending on the rate at which sediment is supplied or removed from them...|$|R
50|$|Erosion of {{soils and}} sediments from coastal dune {{habitats}} {{as well as}} from saltmarshes and sand flats is a threat to the structure and composition of these coastal communities. Erosion occurs predominantly from wind and <b>wave</b> <b>actions</b> but can be increased by reducing vegetation cover or reducing stability in other ways. It can also be increased by high levels of human traffic or the public accessing areas of wetland that are off limits to the public.|$|R
50|$|Site {{selection}} is vastly important in developing potential seaweed farms, and certain criteria {{must be met}} first in order to optimise production. These criteria include suitable current and <b>wave</b> <b>actions</b> to allow for absorption of nutrients, sufficient but not excessive light to allow for optimum photosynthesis, a sufficient water depth not hindered by low tide exposure, an optimum water temperature between 27-30 degrees Celsius, salinity levels of 30-35 0/00, and areas with little presence of grazers, microorganisms, suspended silt, and epiphytes.|$|R
5|$|Over 225,000residents lost {{electricity}} and 12,000 lost telephone service. Some vandalism and looting was reported during {{the loss of}} power, and the police made several arrests during the night. For over 24hours roads were closed on the islands of El Hierro, Tenerife and La Palma: the first two due to landslides and the third {{by the collapse of}} an old house and a massive tree. One of the most famous geological features of the island of Gran Canaria, El Dedo de Dios (or God's finger), which had been pointing towards the sky for over a millennium, was destroyed by Delta's wind and <b>wave</b> <b>action</b> along Gran Canaria's shore. Upon hearing of the destruction of the natural monument one man, later found to be clinically insane, unsuccessfully tried to kill himself and then stabbed three members of his own family.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} ecological zones, {{with their}} progression from shoreline to climax forest, are a classic {{illustration of the}} concept of ecological succession. Much of this progression is due to the changing nature of Presque Isle and its shifting shoreline and dunes. The shoreline, the second zone, is formed by <b>wave</b> <b>action</b> and is in equilibrium between erosion and deposition, with the initial plants stabilizing the sand of the new shoreline. The newly formed sandy plain and the ponds formed in it are the third zone. The ponds start as trapped pockets of lake water and can erode away or be filled by wind-blown sand or drifting dunes. The new ponds provide habitat for plants and animals: for example, the state park is home to 89 species of Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) and Lepidoptera, including 35 different butterflies, as well as 84 different sorts of spiders.|$|E
5|$|<b>Wave</b> <b>action</b> took {{a toll on}} the {{foundations}} of waterfront structures along the coasts of Baldwin and Mobile counties, where Elena inflicted about $715,000 worth of damage to roadways. Most damage was concentrated near the shore, where extensive erosion took place, and on islands and minor peninsulas. Farther inland, Elena's impact was generally limited to downed trees and power lines. The storm destroyed the city boardwalk at Gulf Shores, {{with the cost of}} rebuilding expected to approach $300,000. Alabama Power reported extensive power outages affecting up to 100,000 customers. According to the Insurance Information Institute, storm-related damages in Alabama totaled about $100 million. An estimated 300 homes in the state were destroyed by Hurricane Elena, and another 1,345 sustained lighter damage.|$|E
