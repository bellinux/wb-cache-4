500|$|Jim Farber from Entertainment Weekly {{was also}} {{critical}} of the album {{and gave it a}} [...] "D" [...] rating. Although he called it a [...] "nice idea", he found the collection unnecessary and stated, [...] "do <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>need</b> a Spanish version of 'Don't Rain on My Parade'?". Author Waldman wrote that the album was unsuccessful due to the singer being [...] "dwarfed by the overproduction"; additionally, she felt that Streisand's duet with Ray Charles should have been included on the initial pressing, and Waldman also noted that there were [...] "no new songs added" [...] to the record. She stated that [...] "the message was clear for Streisand ... keep moving forward".|$|E
500|$|Stewart felt betrayed: [...] "It {{has been}} my fight ever since I became a {{minister}} {{to see that the}} farmers of the province were having a square deal," [...] he remarked, [...] "and I think I have done this with some success." [...] Despite his general sympathy with the aims of the UFA, he could not support their transition into a political party. For one, he disagreed with the UFA's belief that politics should be conducted along class, rather than ideological, lines. [...] Stewart believed that [...] "the more strongly armed the classes become the harder will it be to get the things <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>need</b> in our government" [...] and asserted that [...] "I never did and never will have any desire to form a coalition with anybody except with men who think the same as I do." ...|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, {{the album}} {{discusses}} {{negative aspects of}} religion and society, and {{is seen as a}} [...] "companion piece" [...] to Enter Shikari’s A Flash Flood of Colour. Daybreaker lyrics were written by Carter and Tom Searle, who focused on political and [...] "bigger picture" [...] themes. Carter described [...] "Devil's Island" [...] as [...] "one of the hardest songs to write" [...] because of the prominence of its theme of rioting. Searle, who focused on its lyrics, said, [...] "With money firmly ingrained into our global society <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>need</b> to look to alternative solutions when problems like the riots occur because violence is never the solution". Carter said [...] "Black Blood", which was included on the re-release, is about the oil industry, society's strong dependence on oil and the way [...] "short term profit is the only thing these people think about, instead of the longevity of what we really could do and how we could stabilize what's really {{going on in the world}} right now".|$|E
500|$|The New Yorkers David Denby {{felt the}} new version of Hairspray was [...] "perfectly pleasant," [...] but {{compared}} unfavorably to the Broadway musical, since [...] " [...] have removed the traces of camp humor and Broadway blue that gave the stage show its happily knowing flavor." [...] Denby criticized the dance numbers, calling them [...] "unimaginatively shot," [...] and he considered [...] "the idea of substituting John Travolta for Harvey Fierstein as Tracy’s hefty mother... a blandly earnest betrayal." [...] Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com found Hairspray [...] "reasonably entertaining. But do <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>need</b> to be entertained reasonably? Waters' original was a crazy sprawl that made perfect sense; this Hairspray toils needlessly {{to make sense of}} that craziness, and something gets lost in the translation." [...] Zacharek was also displeased with the way Latifah's performance of [...] "I Know Where I've Been" [...] was incorporated into the movie, saying [...] "The filmmakers may believe they're adding an extra layer of seriousness to the material... the inclusion of this big production number only suggests that the filmmakers fear the audience won't get the movie's message unless it's spelled out for them." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Immortality" [...] was {{watched by}} about 3.7 million viewers, drawing a 1.4/4 ratings share on its initial broadcast, down 12.5 {{percent from the}} {{previous}} episode's viewership. During the first half hour, the episode placed second in its timeslot, but dropped to fourth for its second half. Its lead-in, Kitchen Nightmares, also dropped 12 percent, as did all other network shows for that night. Time shifting viewing added 57 percent to the episode's ratings for three days out, and 64 percent for a week following the first airing. This was the greatest DVR gain yet for the series in that timeslot. Despite this, Joshua Jackson urged fans to watch the series live {{in an interview with}} Entertainment Weekly a week after [...] "Immortality" [...] aired. He explained [...] "I'm a positive person in general, but <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>need</b> our Fringe fans to tune in and watch us on Fridays. We did good when we first moved, but last week we did not have a good week, ratings wise. It is going to take the people that like the show to watch the show and start the campaign and show their support if they want to see us stick around for another season." ...|$|E

500|$|In October 2013, Nye began soliciting {{donations}} for {{the purchase}} of Angkor I, which was scheduled to return to the gallery unless $55,000 could be raised by 5pm on November 1, 2013. Two weeks prior to this deadline, the council had raised $31,750, more than $20,000 short of the asking price. In an interview published by The Oregonian, Nye said, [...] "Lee Kelly is a living legend and the pride of Oregon's artistic community. And his studio is right here in Clackamas County. He's a local treasure." [...] She also wrote in a press release, [...] "It would be a terrible loss to the community to have this sculpture removed, but it's fast becoming a reality". The council's board chair, Shari Newman, also stressed the urgent need for financial assistance, saying [...] "We’re more than halfway there, but what <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>need</b> is a handful of lead donors to step forward and make this important work a permanent part of the City’s collection. And we need them now." [...] During the final two weeks of the fundraising campaign, the council draped a black parachute over the sculpture and posted signs requesting financial assistance, such as [...] "Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, this sculpture is leaving... Let's hope it's not." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} was {{produced}} for the song, {{but it was}} never officially released. Stefani's long time collaborator, Sophie Muller, directed the music video during Gwen's first concert tour entitled Harajuku Lovers Tour. A minute long clip of the video surfaced on YouTube on October 13, 2006. At the beginning of the clip, Stefani and her dance troupe, the Harajuku Girls, are shown dancing on various rooftops in a city. The women also appear in front of a yellow building advertisement that reads [...] "Cash Loan" [...] in a red font, followed by [...] "Buy · Sell · Trade" [...] in a green font below. The ladies sport [...] "'80s hairstyles", to which a critic from Spin predicted was in an attempt [...] "to rival some of the best videos from two decades ago". Other parts of the video display the dancers wearing jumpsuits or camouflage outfits; Stefani also wears a denim skirt or a pair of white shorts with a matching tank top. The clip was featured in a list compiled by VH1's Christopher Rosa, titled [...] "8 Amazing Unreleased Music Videos That <b>We</b> <b>Really</b> <b>Need</b> To See". Rosa noted that the video [...] "is now virtually unfindable on the Web", and was disappointed by stating: [...] "We wanted some Madonna realness, Gwen!" ...|$|E
500|$|In October 1999, in {{the year}} {{following}} Tippett's death, A Child of Our Time received a belated New York Philharmonic premiere, at the Avery Fisher Hall. The New York Times reviewer, Paul Griffiths, expressed some astonishment {{that this was the}} orchestra's first attempt at the work. As part of the celebrations for the centenary of the composer's birth in January 2005, English National Opera staged a dramatised performance of the work, directed by Jonathan Kent—coincidentally, the first performance fell in the week of the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the death camps at Auschwitz. Anna Picard, writing in The Independent, recognised the work's sincerity but found the dramatisation of its pacifist message wholly inappropriate: [...] "Do <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>need</b> to see a dozen well-fed actors and singers stripped and led into a smoking pit {{in order to understand the}} Holocaust?" [...] Anthony Holden in The Observer was more positive, commenting that [...] "If you must stage a work intended for concert performance ... it is hard to imagine a more effective version than Kent's, shot through with heavy symbolism of which Tippett would surely have approved." [...] Nevertheless, Holden found the overall result [...] "super-solemn, lurching between the over-literalistic and the portentous". The 2005 Holocaust Days of Remembrance (1–8 May) were marked at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC by a special performance of A Child of Our time, in which the Washington Chorus was directed by Robert Shafer. The piece was performed at the BBC Proms 2016 on 23 July by the BBC National Orchestra and Chorus of Wales.|$|E

5000|$|Brownstein has {{referred}} to the album as a [...] "strident and pointed political record, {{in terms of the}} lyrics". The album contains some of Sleater-Kinney's most polemical songs; [...] "Far Away" [...] explicitly references the September 11 terrorist attacks and contains criticism of American president George W. Bush. Corin Tucker said that it [...] "wasn't really a conscious decision" [...] to write about the attacks, but there was [...] "just such as an overwhelming presence in our minds as we were trying to write songs, that we felt that <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>needed</b> to deal with it, and that <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>needed</b> to write about it". The album's lyrics were also prominently influenced by the recent birth of Tucker's son Marshall Tucker Bangs. According to Tucker, [...] "Marshall is all over One Beat. The last year was definitely a difficult time for me, as he was born nine weeks premature and {{he was in the hospital}} for a while. It was the hardest thing that I've ever lived through, that fear and anxiety, and I think I was able to let go into the music." [...] The song [...] "Sympathy" [...] was written about the [...] "terrifying" [...] experience of Marshall's premature birth. [...] "Hollywood Ending" [...] attacks the concept of celebrity and the mainstream female body image.|$|R
2500|$|The day after, I {{asked my}} pilot, a cheerful young New Zealander, {{if he thought}} <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>needed</b> an escort.

He replied cheerfully that, if we came back safely, no one would say anything, and if we didn't, it wouldn't matter anyway. This seemed sound enough logic, and so we sent off a signal to Robin, announcing our arrival, and set off on our own.|$|R
