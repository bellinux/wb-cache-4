5|$|Matlock's next {{assignment}} was as Deputy Chief of Mission {{in the capital}} of Tanzania, Dar es Salaam. Even in Africa, knowledge of Soviet Affairs proved useful. With Leonid Brezhnev in power, Soviet foreign policy as of 1968 was dictated by the Brezhnev Doctrine, which held that, once a country became Communist, it <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>to</b> leave the Soviet sphere of influence.|$|E
5|$|The house <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>to</b> be {{a private}} {{residence}} again. It was offered for sale in 1929, {{and at a time}} when many country houses were being demolished was given a scrap value of £5,882. With the exception of the Phelips family portraits, the historic contents and furnishing were disposed of, and the house, an empty shell, remained on the market for two years.|$|E
5|$|Goldfaden had an on-again off-again {{relationship}} with Zionism. Some of his earliest poetry was Zionist avant la lettre {{and one of}} his last plays was written in Hebrew; several of his plays were implicitly or explicitly Zionist (Shulamith set in Jerusalem, Mashiach Tzeiten?! ending with its protagonists abandoning New York for Palestine); he served as a delegate from Paris to the World Zionist Congress in 1900. Still, {{he spent most of his}} life (and set slightly more than half of his plays) in the Pale of Settlement and in the adjoining Jewish areas in Romania, and when he left it <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>to</b> go to Palestine, but to cities such as New York, London or Paris. This might be understandable when the number of his potential Jewish spectators in Palestine in his time was very small.|$|E

5|$|Nelson {{returned}} to Bath with Fanny, {{before moving to}} London in October to seek expert medical attention concerning his amputated arm. Whilst in London news reached him that Admiral Duncan had defeated the Dutch fleet at the Battle of Camperdown. Nelson exclaimed {{that he would have}} given his other arm to have been present. He spent the last months of 1797 recuperating in London, during which he was awarded the Freedom of the City of London and a pension of £1,000 a year. He used the money to buy Round Wood Farm near Ipswich, and intended to retire there with Fanny. Despite his plans, Nelson <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>to</b> live there.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the campaigning {{season of}} 1864, Cleburne became engaged to Susan Tarleton of Mobile, Alabama. Their {{marriage}} <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>to</b> be, as Cleburne was killed during an ill-conceived assault (which he opposed) on Union fortifications at the Battle of Franklin, {{just south of}} Nashville, Tennessee, on November 30, 1864. He was last seen advancing on foot toward the Union line with his sword raised, after his horse was shot out from under him. Accounts later {{said that he was}} found just inside the Federal line and his body carried back to an aid station along the Columbia Turnpike. Confederate war records indicate he died of a shot to the abdomen, or possibly a bullet that went through his heart. When Confederates found his body, he had been picked clean of any valuable items, including his sword, boots and pocket watch.|$|E
5|$|Under Glenn Hoddle, Gascoigne {{was picked}} {{regularly}} and helped England {{to win the}} Tournoi de France in 1997 ahead of Brazil, France and Italy. Qualification for the 1998 FIFA World Cup {{went down to the}} last group game against Italy at the Stadio Olimpico, and Gascoigne put in a disciplined and mature performance to help England secure the 0–0 draw that was enough to take them through to the tournament. However, British tabloid newspapers showed pictures of Gascoigne eating kebabs late at night with DJ friend Chris Evans only a week before the final squad was due to be chosen. Hoddle elected not to pick Gascoigne in the final squad and after hearing the news Gascoigne wrecked Hoddle's room in a rage before being restrained. Gascoigne <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>to</b> play for his country again, having won 57 caps and scored 10 goals.|$|E

5|$|Ward's {{thesis is}} {{based on the fact that}} the Thyssen panel, so named after its home at the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, is {{overwhelmingly}} influenced by Campin, while the contemporaneous and more sophisticated Madonna Standing draws heavily from van Eyck. He finds such a sudden shift unlikely, while also pointing out that this work evidences some technical difficulties that Campin <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>to</b> resolve, especially in respect to foreshortening and the rendering of the body beneath the robes. He also points to the architectural similarities in Campin's Marriage of Mary, although this may be a matter of influence.|$|E
