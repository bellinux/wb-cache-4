5|$|Potassium is an {{extremely}} active metal that reacts violently <b>with</b> <b>oxygen</b> in water and air. <b>With</b> <b>oxygen</b> it forms potassium peroxide, and with water potassium forms potassium hydroxide. The reaction of potassium with water is dangerous because of its violent exothermic character {{and the production of}} hydrogen gas. Hydrogen reacts again with atmospheric oxygen, producing water, which reacts with the remaining potassium. This reaction requires only traces of water; because of this, potassium and the liquid sodium-potassium — NaK — are potent desiccants {{that can be used to}} dry solvents prior to distillation.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} if chronic oxygen dependency (discharge home on supplemental <b>oxygen)</b> in children <b>with</b> bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD; defined as requirement for supplemental O 2 at 36 weeks postmenstrual age) predicts neurodevelopmental disability rates and growth outcomes at 36 months corrected age (CA). STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort study. SETTING: Southern Alberta regional center located at high altitude. PARTICIPANTS: Preterm infants weighing ≤ 1250 grams with no BPD, BPD, and BPD <b>with</b> chronic <b>oxygen</b> dependency. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Neurodevelopmental and growth outcomes. RESULTS: Of 1563 preterm infants admitted from 1995 - 2007, 1212 survived. Complete follow-up data {{were available for}} 1030 (85 %) children. Children in BPD and BPD <b>with</b> chronic <b>oxygen</b> dependency groups had significantly lower birth weights, gestational ages, prolonged mechanical ventilation and oxygen supplementation and received more postnatal steroids, compared to those without BPD. Children with BPD and BPD <b>with</b> chronic <b>oxygen</b> dependency {{were more likely to}} be below the 5 th centile in weight and height compared to those without BPD but there was little difference between the BPD and BPD <b>with</b> chronic <b>oxygen</b> dependency groups. After controlling for confounding variables, children who had BPD and BPD <b>with</b> chronic <b>oxygen</b> dependency had higher odds of neurodevelopmental disability compared to those without BPD [OR (odds ratio) 1. 9 (95 %CI 1. 1 to 3. 5) and OR 1. 8 (1. 1 to 2. 9), respectively], with no significant difference between BPD and BPD <b>with</b> chronic <b>oxygen</b> dependency [OR 0. 9 (95 % CI 0. 6 to 1. 5) ]. CONCLUSIONS: BPD and BPD <b>with</b> chronic <b>oxygen</b> dependency in children predicts abnormal neurodevelopmental outcomes at 36 months CA. However, the neurodevelopmental disability rates were not significantly higher in BPD <b>with</b> chronic <b>oxygen</b> dependency children compared to children with BPD only. Compared to those without BPD, growth is impaired in children with BPD and BPD <b>with</b> chronic <b>oxygen</b> dependency, but no difference between the latter two groups...|$|R

5|$|Although {{dopamine}} {{is normally}} {{broken down by}} an oxidoreductase enzyme, it is also susceptible to oxidation by direct reaction <b>with</b> <b>oxygen,</b> yielding quinones plus various free radicals as products.

Quinones and free radicals produced by autoxidation of dopamine can poison cells, and there is evidence that this mechanism may contribute to the cell loss that occurs in Parkinson's disease and other conditions.|$|E
