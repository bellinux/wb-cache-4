25|$|In 1244 and 1245 the Cistercian general chapter had {{determined}} that a monastery of nuns could {{be incorporated into the}} Cistercian Order only if the competent bishop and the competent cathedral chapter exempted the community's temporalities and spiritualities from their control.

25|$|Anyone who {{can gain}} Administrators access can overwrite, {{override}} {{or change the}} Data Recovery Agent configuration. This {{is a very serious}} issue, since an attacker can for example hack the Administrator account (using third-party tools), set whatever DRA certificate they <b>want</b> <b>as</b> the Data Recovery Agent and wait. This is sometimes referred to as a two-stage attack, which is a significantly different scenario than the risk due to a lost or stolen PC, but which highlights the risk due to malicious insiders.|$|E

25|$|One form of buffet {{is to have}} {{a display}} counter or table filled with plates {{containing}} fixed portions of food; customers select plates containing whichever dishes they <b>want</b> <b>as</b> they walk along. The food display may either be staffed, or the customers may pick up the food plates themselves. This form is most commonly seen in cafeterias. Another derivative of this type of buffet occurs where patrons choose food from a buffet style layout and then pay based on what was chosen (sometimes based on the weight of the food, or color-coded plates).|$|E
25|$|The {{school year}} usually runs from June to March, {{although}} it may also end in April, depending on when the Holy Week is. Republic Act 7797 states that a school year may not exceed two hundred and twenty school days, and that it may only start classes between the first Monday of June and last day of August. While K–12 private schools are free to assign the date of opening of classes anytime they <b>want</b> <b>as</b> {{long as it is}} within the prescribed period, K–12 public schools have to follow a stringent school calendar crafted by DepEd regardless of circumstances.|$|E
25|$|Players can {{run with}} the ball in any {{direction}} they want. However they cannot use a teammate to obstruct the opposition. This occurs when they run around or into {{one of their own}} players and in the process prevent a defender from tackling them. Defending teams can also run anywhere they <b>want</b> <b>as</b> long as they do not start from an offside position. Offside lines are behind the last foot at a ruck, maul or tackle or five and ten metres back from scrums and lineouts respectively. If the ball is kicked, players from the kicking team cannot run forward until they have been passed by the kicker or someone behind the kicker.|$|E

25|$|In August 1971, Rick Wakeman {{joined the}} {{progressive}} rock band Yes {{as a replacement}} to their original keyboardist Tony Kaye. Towards {{the end of the}} year, he signed a five-album deal as a solo artist with A Records. While touring the United States with Yes on their Fragile Tour promote Fragile (1971), Wakeman was informed by his manager Brian Lane that A co-founder and executive Jerry Moss wished to meet him at A Studios in Los Angeles. Moss wished for Wakeman to record a solo album and offered an advance of $12,500, around £4,000, to produce it which Wakeman accepted. As part of his signing on fee, Wakeman received a 1957 Cadillac limousine from A which he claimed was once owned by Clark Gable and had it shipped to England. Wakeman chose it after the label asked him what he would <b>want</b> <b>as</b> a present and remembered he had seen the car in the building's parking lot.|$|E

500|$|Bottomley's {{parliamentary}} ambitions {{were suddenly}} halted in 1912, {{when he was}} successfully sued for £49,000 {{by one of his}} Joint Stock Trust victims. Unable to pay, and with massive debts, he was bankrupted with liabilities totalling £233,000. Since bankrupts are ineligible to sit in the House of Commons, he had to resign his seat; after his departure the future Lord Chancellor, F. E. Smith, wrote that [...] "is absence from the House of Commons has impoverished the public stock of gaiety, of cleverness, of common sense". Prior to his bankruptcy, Bottomley had ensured that his main assets were legally owned by relatives or nominees, and was thus able to continue his extravagant lifestyle. John Bull remained an ample source of funds, and Bottomley boasted that although nominally bankrupt, [...] "I never had a better time in my life—plenty of money and everything else I <b>want</b> <b>as</b> well".|$|E

500|$|The Reproductive Freedom Project of ACLU, {{according}} to their mission statement, actively works provide access to any and all reproductive health care for any human, regardless of race, gender, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, or political standing. In some cases, Reproductive Freedom Programs fund ultrasounds and abortions and any lodging, meals, or transportation that go with that. Because women have reported finding it necessary to cross state lines or wait weeks for an abortion, The Reproductive Freedom Project states {{that they want to}} fight for individuals [...] "state by state and law by law" [...] until every individual can pursue the kind of lifestyle they <b>want.</b> <b>As</b> stated on their website, [...] "states have enacted more restrictions to abortion than they did in the previous 10 years combined". The ACLU claims to be committed to fighting injustices with access to education on what accessibilities one has to abortions, birth control, religious rights, as well as trying to diminish abstinence-only sexual education, for ACLU claims that abstinence only education promotes a lack of willingness to use contraceptives.|$|E

500|$|Freedom From Want had {{previously}} been less entwined in the standard liberalism philosophies {{of the western world}} than the other three freedoms (speech, fear, and religion); this freedom added economic liberty as a societal aspiration. In his essay, Bulosan treats negative liberties as positive liberties by suggesting that Americans be [...] "given equal opportunity to serve themselves and each other according to their needs and abilities", an echo of Karl Marx's [...] "from each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs". [...] In the final paragraph of the essay, the phrase [...] "The America we hope to see is not merely a physical but also a spiritual and intellectual world" [...] describes an egalitarian America. [...] In a voice likened to Steinbeck's in works such as The Grapes of Wrath, Bulosan's essay spoke up for those who struggled to survive in the capitalist democracy and was regarded as [...] "haunting and sharp" [...] against the backdrop of Rockwell's feast of plenty. It proposed that while citizens had obligations to the state, the state had an obligation to provide a basic level of subsistence. Unlike Roosevelt, Bulosan presented the case that the New Deal had not already granted freedom from <b>want</b> <b>as</b> it did not guarantee Americans the essentials of life.|$|E

[...] She also claimed that a travelling woman told her how to insert the rabbits into her body, and how such a scheme would ensure that she would [...] "never <b>want</b> <b>as</b> long as I liv'd". [...] The British Journal reported that on 7January 1727 she appeared at the Courts of Quarter Sessions at Westminster, charged [...] "for being an abominable cheat and imposter in pretending to be delivered of several monstrous births". [...] Margaret Toft had remained staunch, and refused to comment further.

500|$|In {{the early}} 1580s, with the {{development}} of English colonization schemes, initially in Ireland and later in North America, a new method to alleviate the condition of the poor would be suggested and utilized considerably over time. [...] Merchant and colonization proponent, George Peckham noted the then-current domestic conditions; [...] "there are at this day great numbers which Hue in such penurie & <b>want,</b> <b>as</b> they could be content to hazard their Hues, and to [...] one yeere for meat, drinke and apparell only, without wages, in hope thereby to amend their estates." [...] With this, he may have been the first to suggest what became the institution of [...] indentured service. [...] At the same time Richard Hakluyt, in his preface to Divers Voyages, likens English planters to [...] "Bees...led out by their Captaines to swarme abroad"; he recommends [...] "deducting" [...] the poor out of the realm. Hakluyt also broadens the scope and additionally recommends to empty the prisons and send them off to the New World. By 1619 Virginia's system of indentured service would be fully developed, and subsequent colonies would adopt the method with modifications suitable to their different conditions and times. English penal transportation would be implemented soon afterwards, and evolve into a subsidized government endeavor with the Transportation Act 1717.|$|E
