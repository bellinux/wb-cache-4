25|$|Ron Meyer’s {{recruiting}} {{strategy was}} very aggressive. He pursued and attracted the finest football players {{from all of}} Texas. Not all of his players were acquired the ethical way, however; his recruiting staff was paying recruits, and Meyer <b>was</b> <b>letting</b> it slide. According to Steve Endicott the first payments came at Kashmere High School in Houston, Texas. “...

25|$|Hussain's father {{initially}} {{refused to}} accept that his son couldn't bowl to the previous high standards and continued to push him into bowling, while Hussain, full of frustration at his sudden loss of ability felt he <b>was</b> <b>letting</b> his father down. Concerns over his father's expectations of him would continue throughout Hussain's career, as he related in his biography after retiring. After {{the loss of his}} bowling, Hussain dropped behind his contemporaries; Atherton, Ramprakash and Martin Bicknell all began to receive professional county contracts while Hussain was not being selected for representative games and England tours. Hussain switched to batting while he was still captain of Essex under-16s and moved himself up the order to get more runs and to bowl less. His batting progressed, and in that year he became the first under-16 at Forest to score 1,000 runs in a season since 1901. Hussain himself admitted that batting never came as naturally to him as leg-spin bowling. Throughout his career he batted with little left elbow and plenty of bottom hand, and backed-up with the bat in his right hand.|$|E

As the situation at Finschhafen became increasingly precarious, Lieutenant General Sir Edmund Herring grew frustrated with Carpender's attitude, and appealed to Blamey, who in turn took up the matter with MacArthur. On 29 September 1943, Carpender agreed to use high-speed transports to send an additional battalion to Finschhafen, and the crisis passed.

However, {{at the same}} time Friday's disciplinary record was becoming so bad that even the Evening Post, usually favourable to him, criticised him on 30 September 1974, just after he had scored his first hat-trick for Reading in a 4–1 victory over Southport. He was the Football League's joint top scorer by this time with nine goals, but he had also already been booked three times that season and the Post argued that by constantly risking suspension he <b>was</b> <b>letting</b> the team down. Under the system then used, the three bookings gave him an automatic two-match suspension. The article argued that missing games because of [...] "completely unnecessary" [...] and [...] "stupid" [...] infractions amounted to selling the club short.|$|E

The song was released as a promotional single {{in anticipation of the}} re-release of Overcome (2010). Burke stated that the song was written when her aunt told the singer about how she and her partner were experiencing troubles in their relationship, and that they were not telling each other how they felt. In response, Burke asked her aunt why he <b>was</b> <b>letting</b> the silence in their relationship do the talking instead of them discussing it. [...] "The Silence" [...] is an R and pop-influenced power ballad and instrumentation consists of a piano, a guitar and drums. The lyrics of the song feature the protagonist asking why the other person in the relationship remains silent about their difficulties instead of talking about them.|$|E

[...] Carey explained that Mimi is a [...] "very personal nickname" [...] only used by those in her inner circle, and thus the title meant she <b>was</b> <b>letting</b> her guard down and inviting her fans to be that much closer to her.

500|$|According to Betty Cortina of People magazine, Dreaming of You {{marked a}} shift that abrogated the singer being marketed {{as part of}} her band and billed Selena as an American solo artist in [...] "the most {{fundamental}} way for her". From 1989, Selena's brother A.B. Quintanilla became Selena's principal music producer and songwriter, and remained so throughout her career. Because Quintanilla III was working on the singer's follow-up recording to Amor Prohibido (1994), he could not produce the crossover album. He was asked to meet with several producers in New York and choose one who would best [...] "fit with Selena's style". Dreaming of You was the first album Selena's family did not produce. They had decided to step down before the recording sessions and allow professional pop producers to work with her. Quintanilla III and Selena flew to Nashville, Tennessee, and met with Keith Thomas, who had prepared the instrumental parts for the song called [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] but had not yet completed the vocal parts, so he sang it for them. Selena and Quintanilla III immediately liked it; Quintanilla III said he wanted Selena to include it on her album. [...] Recording sessions began in December 1994 at The Bennett House in Franklin, Tennessee; Selena had to return later when Thomas could provide additional vocals. Selena and her husband Chris Pérez arrived at the studio on March 24, 1995 to finish recording the song. In a 2002 interview, Pérez said Thomas provided Selena with a cassette of [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] and said she had the song [...] "on loop" [...] and she [...] "must have heard it a hundred times". He believed it had an [...] "effect on her" [...] because [...] "she went into the studio the next day to actually do the recording and just was nailing things left and right and [...] <b>was</b> <b>letting</b> her do her thing and I mean it was an incredible thing to watch".|$|E
