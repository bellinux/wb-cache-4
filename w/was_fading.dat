He returned to coaching his club team, Hamburger SV (now renamed BG Baskets Hamburg), which included national team members Mareike Adermann and Edina Müller (and Australia's Bridie Kean). It {{went on to win the}} national championship for the eighth time in 2013. The national team was not so fortunate, losing the European Championship to the Netherlands by a point, 56–57, before a home town crowd in Frankfurt in July 2013.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, British actress Gertrude Lawrence's {{business}} manager and attorney, Fanny Holtzmann, {{was looking for}} a new vehicle for her client when the 1944 Margaret Landon novel Anna and the King of Siam (a fictionalized version of Leonowens' experiences) was sent to her by Landon's agent. According to Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest, Holtzmann was worried that Lawrence's career <b>was</b> <b>fading.</b> The 51-year-old actress had appeared only in plays, not in musicals, since Lady in the Dark closed in 1943. Holtzmann agreed that a musical based on Anna and the King of Siam would be ideal for her client, who purchased the rights to adapt the novel for the stage.|$|E
5|$|In March–April 1918, Battleship Division Nine escorted the Scandinavian Convoy {{two more}} times. Both {{missions}} were hampered by storms {{that made the}} going particularly slow, but were otherwise uneventful. Still, confidence in the wisdom of using battleships as an escort <b>was</b> <b>fading</b> at the Admiralty, and Admiral Beatty in particular was opposed to it. When the American ships returned to the new Grand Fleet base at Rosyth {{at the end of}} the second mission on 20 April, it was the last time they were used to escort the Scandinavian Convoy.|$|E

5|$|In the Byzantine {{period the}} {{evolution}} of the port is halted due to the frequent invasions by the migratory people, the trade <b>was</b> <b>fading</b> and the traders were looking for other more secure markets like Venice or Genoa but many constructions in the port maintain the name genovese in the memory of the merchants from the Italian city. After a brief period when the port was under Romanian rule, the Dobruja region was occupied by the Ottoman Empire. In 1857, the Turkish authorities leased the port and the Cernavodă–Constanța Railway to the British company Danube and Black Sea Railway and Kustendge Harbour Company Ltd.|$|E
5|$|Since the T65 project <b>was</b> <b>fading</b> away, the Armored Force {{still needed}} a light {{anti-aircraft}} vehicle, so {{they made a}} new project (called T65E1) based on the new T24 chassis (a prototype of the M24 Chaffee). The T65E1 had the same overall layout as the T65 GMC – gun turret at rear with the engines {{in the middle of}} the chassis – with a few minor tweaks (including an angular gun shield instead of a straight one).|$|E
5|$|The Duke's {{return to}} favour under the House of Hanover {{enabled him to}} preside over {{the defeat of the}} 1715 Jacobite rising from London (although it was his former assistant, Cadogan, who {{directed}} the operations). But his health <b>was</b> <b>fading,</b> and on 28 May 1716 (O.S.), shortly {{after the death of his}} daughter Anne, Countess of Sunderland, he suffered a paralytic stroke at Holywell House. This was followed by another, more severe stroke in November, this time at a house on the Blenheim estate. The Duke recovered somewhat, but while his speech had become impaired his mind remained clear, recovering enough to ride out to watch the builders at work on Blenheim Palace and attend the Lords to vote for Oxford's impeachment.|$|E

5|$|By September 10, the {{prospect}} of securing a Baton Rouge location to host the Hornets <b>was</b> <b>fading</b> {{as a result of}} the facilities being utilized for hurricane related relief operations. Numerous cities inquired about hosting the franchise for the season, including Kansas City, Louisville, Nashville, Oklahoma City and San Diego. During this period, Oklahoma City announced that it was the favored choice to serve as the temporary home of the franchise, although by mid-September SMG announced that the New Orleans arena could potentially be ready for occupancy by the All-Star Game break. However, by late September the Hornets finalized a move to Oklahoma City, where 35 games would be played at the Ford Center, as well as six in Baton Rouge at the Pete Maravich Assembly Center. Additionally, it was announced that three of the games in March could be moved to New Orleans if the arena repairs were complete. At the same time, the NBA also announced the team would be referred to officially as the New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets, and that the deal reached with Oklahoma City would allow for the team to return for the 2006–07 season, if necessary.|$|E
5|$|The UCLA Bruins {{became an}} Oregon rival {{in track and}} field as the two {{powerhouse}} programs battled each other in a series of dual meets. Oregon's program was ranked in the top 3 nationally in dual meets by Track & Field News thirteen times between 1970 and 1996 and was ranked No. 1 three times. The UCLA squad achieved a No. 1 ranking from the same publication eleven times within the same time frame. In 1966, the two programs met head to head for the first time. The Bruins displayed their dominance at the dual meet and won nine straight against the Ducks. Oregon head coach Bill Bowerman in 1971 called the Bruins team the best dual meet team in the country. It wasn't until 1978 that Oregon earned its first victory in the series, which ended UCLA's 34 dual meet winning streak. Oregon won the next three meets and the series ended in 1985 with a UCLA win. The dual meet event <b>was</b> <b>fading</b> out of favor in collegiate track and field and the Oregon-UCLA dual meet was discontinued with UCLA holding the advantage over the Ducks 10–4. In 1994, the Pepsi Team Invitational which included Oregon, UCLA and Washington was scored as a dual meet, which UCLA won. In 2008, the dual meet series between the two schools restarted and Oregon won the first three meets. Although the location of the meet had alternated between Eugene and Los Angeles between 1966 and 1976, subsequent meets have been held at Hayward Field in Oregon until 2011 where the two teams battled to a tie at UCLA. The dual meet was discontinued in 2012 due to scheduling difficulties in an Olympic year.|$|E
