40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to examine the {{relationships}} among the perceived experiences <b>of</b> <b>contingency</b> and incontingency, emotional intelligence, shyness, and self-esteem. Participants were 322 undergraduates. The perceived experiences <b>of</b> <b>contingency</b> and incontingency were assessed by the perceived experiences <b>of</b> <b>contingency</b> scales developed by Maki et al. （ 2003 ）. This scale have 15 items corresponding to perceived experiences <b>of</b> <b>contingency</b> and 15 items corresponding to perceived experiences of incontingency. The emotional intelligence were measured by two scales, WLEIS（Wong & Law, 2002 ）and J-ESCQ（Toyota, et al., 2005 ）originally developed by Taksic（ 2002 ）. Analysis of results based on Structure equation modeling （SEM）indicated that the perceived experiences <b>of</b> <b>contingency</b> and incontingency influended self-esteem and shyness via emotional intelligence, although those experiences have small direct influences on both of them. The levels of self-esteem and shyness in 8 groups by 2 levels（low and high）and 3 scales（the perceived experiences <b>of</b> <b>contingency,</b> those <b>of</b> incontingency and emotional intelligence）were compared. These comparisons revealed that the high levels of the perceived experiences <b>of</b> <b>contingency</b> and emotional intelligence led to higher level of self-esteem and lower level of shyness, and that the effects of the perceived experiences <b>of</b> <b>contingency</b> on shyness were affected by the levels of emotional intelligence. Although the level of self-esteem was influenced by the level of the perceived experiences of incontingency, the level of shyness was not. These results were interpreted as showing that the perceived experiences <b>of</b> <b>contingency</b> and incontingency mainly influenced shyness and self-esteem via emotional intelligence...|$|R

50|$|Students who {{base their}} {{self-esteem}} on their academic successes use their school work {{to prove their}} intelligence. Since failures in domains <b>of</b> <b>contingency</b> have negative effects on one's self-esteem, students will avoid failure by increasing their effort, by abandoning their goals and becoming completely unmotivated, or by making excuses to lessen the impact on their self-esteem. In Jennifer Crocker's journal <b>Contingencies</b> <b>of</b> self-worth: Implications for self-regulation and psychological vulnerability, the author states that <b>contingencies</b> <b>of</b> self-worth are used {{as a source of}} motivation and a psychological vulnerability. This means that <b>contingencies</b> <b>of</b> self-worth can cause one to strive for success or weaken one's self-esteem. <b>Contingencies</b> <b>of</b> self-worth are associated with validation of one's abilities in the domain <b>of</b> <b>contingency,</b> and students spend more time on activities related to their specific domains <b>of</b> <b>contingency.</b> When individuals have self-validation goals, mistakes, failures, criticism, and negative feedback are seen as threats rather than learning opportunities. A solution would be to replace self-validating goals with learning goals.

40|$|The {{topic of}} the present {{dissertation}} is the issue <b>of</b> <b>contingency</b> in Hegel’s Science of Logic and in his Elements of the Philosophy of Right. Through the analysis <b>of</b> <b>contingency,</b> my aim is to underline the structural link between logical and political dimension of Hegel’s philosophy. The first chapter deals with Hegel’s analysis <b>of</b> <b>contingency</b> inside the Science of Logic: special attention {{is given to the}} dialectics of modal categories in the section on Actuality and to the relationship between necessity and contingency in the Subjective Logic. I will explain that the problem <b>of</b> <b>contingency</b> is pivotal to the speculative structures of Hegelian logic. Hence, I will show how the issue of modal logic becomes a central {{topic of the}} entire Subjective Logic. The second chapter concerns the logic of the Objective Spirit, and its complex connection with the logic of Science of Logic: we will discuss the famous statement concerning the reciprocity of the actual and the rational, the practical-political dimension of actuality, necessity and contingency, and the link between modal categories and the idea of freedom. The third chapter highlights the political relevance of the logical categories <b>of</b> <b>contingency,</b> necessity and actuality in Hegel’s dealing with the framework of modern political science: the theory of natural law, and also modern disciplines like political economy, administrative sciences, State’s theory, international right. From this background, {{it will be possible to}} discuss Hegel’s ideas of freedom, subjectivity, human agency, law and power, representation, political sharing and constitution, war. Countering the mainstream interpretation, I show that Hegel’s political philosophy is not the affirmation of the blind necessity of laws, institutions and State over the subjects and their common agency. On the contrary, Hegel’s idea of the political is the outcome of an important understanding <b>of</b> <b>contingency.</b> His entire philosophy is a great attempt to face this contingent dimensio...|$|R
40|$|Three studies {{tested the}} {{activation}} and consequences <b>of</b> <b>contingencies</b> <b>of</b> self-worth associated with specific significant others, that is, relationship-specific <b>contingencies</b> <b>of</b> self-worth. The {{results showed that}} activating the mental representation of a significant other with whom one strongly desires closeness led participants to stake their self-esteem in domains in which the significant other wanted them to excel. This was shown in terms <b>of</b> self-reported <b>contingencies</b> <b>of</b> self-worth (Study 1), in terms of self-worth after receiving feedback on a successful or unsatisfactory performance in a relationship-specific contingency domain (Study 2), {{and in terms of}} feelings of reduced self-worth after thinking about a failure in a relationship-specific contingency domain (Study 3). Across studies, a variety <b>of</b> <b>contingency</b> domains were examined. Furthermore, Study 3 showed that failing in an activated relationship-specific contingency domain had negative implications for current feelings of closeness and acceptance in the significant-other relationship. Overall, the findings suggest that people’s <b>contingencies</b> <b>of</b> self-worth depend on the social situation and that performance in relationship-specific contingency domains can influence people’s perceptions of their relationships...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{objectives}} of electric utility {{is to reduce the}} probability of load curtailment during the contingencies. This objective could only be achieved by the proper and timely control actions against these contingencies. For such an operational decision, an accurate and timely assessment and ranking <b>of</b> <b>contingencies</b> against the probability and frequency of load curtailment, and cascading outage are needed. Conventional techniques to assess the severity of such events are largely based on the assessment <b>of</b> post <b>contingency</b> voltage stability indices. These approaches are often found to be time consuming and sometime unreliable. This study attempts to investigate the effectiveness of different reliability indices in predicting the severity <b>of</b> <b>contingencies.</b> Different composite reliability indices are compared with the more sophisticated voltage stability and system loadability indices. Finding of this study is; use of these reliability indices as additional information to assess the severity <b>of</b> <b>contingencies</b> would complement the effectiveness of conventional approaches...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{argues that}} the concept <b>of</b> <b>contingency</b> plays {{a central role in}} Althusser's {{recasting}} of Marxist philosophy and in his attempt to free the Marxist conception of history from concepts such as teleology, necessity and origin. It is critically placed both against those readings that see the emergence of the problematic <b>of</b> <b>contingency</b> only in the late Althusserm and to the most recent attempts to establish a straightforward continuity in Althusser's work. Drawing on published and unplublished material and covering the entirety of Althusser's philosophical itinerary, the thesis seeks both to unearth the latent presence of this problematic, and its various implications, at each stage in the development of his work. It seeks to clarify, in a systematic way, the conceptual consequences of Althusser's commitment to contingency to the received understanding of his conceptions of structural change, ideology and political action. In particular, it {{argues that the}} standpoint <b>of</b> <b>contingency</b> allows us to locate in Althusser's 'Structural Marxism' the emergence of a 'logic of irruption' and structurally under-determined development of becoming. By emphasising this logic <b>of</b> <b>contingency,</b> it then seeks to produce a more nuanced assessment of his theory of ideology through the introduction of the concept of 'overinterpellation'. It finally attempts to distinguish two moments in the emergence (from the early 1970 s onward) of a materialism <b>of</b> <b>contingency,</b> first political and then philosophical; the problematic coexistence of these two aspects helps to account for the unstable charactoer of Althusser's late philosophical project...|$|R

In this part, the cases of several subsets <b>of</b> <b>contingencies</b> with different unstable modes are dealt with. Some preventive actions benefiting a subset <b>of</b> <b>contingencies</b> may go against the stability of others; thus coordination among the optimal schemes for individual subsets is necessary. The coordination is achieved by properly replacing preventive actions with emergency actions for some individual subsets. It is formulated as a classical model of economic dispatch with additional generating costs due to the emergency actions. Such an optimal algorithm is proposed based on the algorithm in the Part-I and verified by simulations on a Chinese power system. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|The paper’s main aims can be {{formulated}} as follows: a) Hegel has {{a strong}} notion <b>of</b> <b>contingency.</b> Contingency is for him not simple absence of necessity, and not simple under-determinedness either. Contingency is an original notion, having the same logical and metaphysical weight and dignity as the notion of necessity; b) this “strong” notion <b>of</b> <b>contingency</b> is decisive for Hegel’s conception of subjectivity. Insofar it can be tracked up to his real philosophy. Other than assumed in many commonplace interpretations of Hegel, I will suggest that the power to go from necessity to contingency makes up {{an essential part of}} subjective freedom as much as the power to go from contingency to necessity. This has important consequences especially in the philosophy of history, which is shown to be not aprioristic and dogmatic, but open to contingency (though not to sceptical conclusions); and c) consistently with the recognition of the irreducibility <b>of</b> <b>contingency</b> to a priori concepts, Hegel also recognizes the need for a non-philosophical narration <b>of</b> <b>contingency</b> and gives us some interesting clues about it and its relationship to philosophy. Throughout my argumentation of these three theses, I hope to provide evidence for the thesis that dogmatic constructions on Hegel’s philosophy of history (including, but not limited to the so-called thesis of the “end of history”) can be undermined by referring to Hegel’s understanding <b>of</b> <b>contingency.</b> On a more general scale, this also shows that the logical groundwork of Hegel’s real philosophy cannot be abandoned without jeopardizing the potential of Hegel’s thought to contribute to current philosophical debates. My argument is structured as follows. I will, first of all, comment on some passages of Hegel’s Science of Logic {{from the beginning of the}} “Subjective logic” regarding the logic <b>of</b> <b>contingency</b> (I) and the presence <b>of</b> <b>contingency</b> in the logical structure of subjectivity (II). I will then proceed to illustrate, with reference to a specific case, the role played by contingency in Hegel’s philosophy of history (III). In the last section (IV), I will discuss the relationship between truth and contingency on the one side, and philosophy and narrativity on the other side, attempting to sketch the main lines of a “narration of contingency” on Hegelian basis...|$|R
