5|$|On 19 August 1800, when Anning was 15 months old, {{an event}} {{occurred}} that {{became part of}} local lore. She was being held by a neighbour, Elizabeth Haskings, who <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>with</b> two other women under an elm tree watching an equestrian show being put on by a travelling company of horsemen, when lightning struck the tree killing all three women below. Onlookers rushed the infant home where she was revived in a bath of hot water. A local doctor declared her survival miraculous. Her family {{said she had been}} a sickly baby before the event but afterwards she seemed to blossom. For years afterward members of her community would attribute the child's curiosity, intelligence and lively personality to the incident.|$|E

2500|$|In 1918, McCall {{decided not}} to run for reelection, and again stood for the United States Senate. [...] In a party {{nomination}} rematch with Weeks, he abandoned the campaign after it became clear the conservative Crane wing of the party <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>with</b> Weeks. [...] The seat ended up being won by ex-Governor Walsh in a Democratic upset. [...] In the general election, McCall refused to campaign on Weeks' behalf, a move that contributed {{to the end of his}} political career. [...] In 1920, he was nominated by President Woodrow Wilson for a seat on the United States Tariff Commission; the nomination was rejected by the Republican-controlled Senate.|$|E
2500|$|There are no {{verbatim}} transcriptions of Henry's {{speech in}} opposition to the Stamp Act. Texts are reconstructions, for the most part based on recollections decades later by which time both the speech and Henry had become famous. For example, Jefferson, still in his studies at the nearby College of William and Mary, recalled the splendor of Henry's oratory. No attempt was made to reconstruct Henry's words until 1790, when James Madison wrote to former burgess Edmund Pendleton, but Madison learned that Pendleton had not been present; a second attempt did not occur until Wirt began work on his biography of Henry in 1805 [...] A French traveler, whose name is not known, and whose journal was discovered in 1921, recorded at the time of Henry's speech that [...] "one of the members stood up and said that he had read that in former times Tarquin and Julius had their Brutus, Charles had his Cromwell, and he did not doubt but some good American would stand up, in favour of his country". As Patrick had seemingly called for the killing of King George III, there were cries of [...] "Treason!" [...] in the chamber, including by the Speaker, John Robinson. John Tyler Sr. (father of the future president), who <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>with</b> Jefferson as they watched the session, called this one of [...] "the trying moments which is decisive of character", and both recalled that Henry did not waver: [...] "If this be treason, make the most of it!".|$|E
