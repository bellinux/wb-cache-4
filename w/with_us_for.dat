500|$|The {{thematic}} {{content of}} heavy metal {{has long been}} a target of criticism. According to Jon Pareles, [...] "Heavy metal's main subject matter is simple and virtually universal. With grunts, moans and subliterary lyrics, it celebrates... a party without limits... he bulk of the music is stylized and formulaic." [...] Music critics have often deemed metal lyrics juvenile and banal, and others have objected to what they see as advocacy of misogyny and the occult. During the 1980s, the Parents Music Resource Center petitioned the U.S. Congress to regulate the popular music industry due to what the group asserted were objectionable lyrics, particularly those in heavy metal songs. Andrew Cope states that claims that heavy metal lyrics are misogynistic are [...] "clearly misguided" [...] as these critics have [...] "overlook the overwhelming evidence that suggests otherwise." [...] Music critic Robert Christgau called metal [...] "an expressive mode [...] it sometimes seems will be <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>for</b> as long as ordinary white boys fear girls, pity themselves, and are permitted to rage against a world they'll never beat".|$|E

2500|$|Lévesque {{had argued}} that the party should not make {{sovereignty}} {{the object of the}} 1985 election and instead opt for the [...] "Beau risque" [...] strategy of seeking an understanding with the federal government of Brian Mulroney, which angered the strongest supporters of sovereignty within the party. He said the issue in the upcoming election would not be sovereignty. Instead, he expressed hope, [...] "that we can finally find government leaders in Ottawa who will discuss Quebec's demands seriously and work <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>for</b> the greater good of Quebecers." [...] His new position weakened his position within the party. Some senior members resigned; there were byelection defeats.

2500|$|Regarding the 'Long March', Prestes {{subsequently}} {{wrote that}} [...] "the tactics of swift marches, evasion {{as far as}} possible of contact with superior enemy forces and surprise attacks aimed at demoralizing the enemy and capturing arms and ammunition, demonstrated that in Brazilian conditions it was possible to stage a protracted struggle". However, years later he was critical of the futility of his own strategy, writing that [...] "I also defended the column's march tactics, claiming that they presented opportunities for recruiting new fighters. This, however, was not the case. The farmers sympathised <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>for</b> the simple reason that we were against the oppressors, they admired our heroism and devotion, but had no intention (with rare exceptions of some young people) of committing themselves to a struggle in whose success they could not believe".|$|E

Tortarella stated: [...] "I'm not going to lie, it's a little weird for me coming back, but once the game starts, it's about playing and {{trying to find a way}} to get a win".

Kenseth competed against Reiser at Madison, and won 12 of 17 features at the track. He won the 1994 Slinger Nationals at Slinger Super Speedway. In 1995, he repeated with back-to-back championships at Madison and WIR, plus he won the Red, White, and Blue state championship series at WIR on three Saturday nights.

2500|$|Although Arnold's poetry {{received}} only mixed reviews and attention during his lifetime, his forays into literary criticism were more successful. [...] Arnold {{is famous for}} introducing a methodology of literary criticism somewhere between the historicist approach common to many critics {{at the time and}} the personal essay; he often moved quickly and easily from literary subjects to political and social issues. [...] His Essays in Criticism (1865, 1888), remains a significant influence on critics to this day, and his prefatory essay to that collection, [...] "The Function of Criticism at the Present Time", {{is one of the most}} influential essays written on the role of the critic in identifying and elevating literature — even while admitting, [...] "The critical power is of lower rank than the creative." [...] In one of his most famous essays on the topic, [...] "The Study of Poetry", Arnold wrote that, [...] "Without poetry, our science will appear incomplete; and most of what now passes <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>for</b> religion and philosophy will be replaced by poetry". He considered the most important criteria used to judge the value of a poem were [...] "high truth" [...] and [...] "high seriousness". By this standard, Chaucer's Canterbury Tales did not merit Arnold's approval. Further, Arnold thought the works that had been proven to possess both [...] "high truth" [...] and [...] "high seriousness", such as those of Shakespeare and Milton, could be used as a basis of comparison to determine the merit of other works of poetry. He also sought for literary criticism to remain disinterested, and said that the appreciation should be of [...] "the object as in itself it really is." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1675, the Iroquois {{made peace}} with the Machian while finally {{defeating}} the Susquenhannock. In the late 1670s and early 1680s, the Five Nations started to raid {{what is now the}} Midwest, battling the Miami and the Illinois while alternatively fighting against and attempting to make an alliance with the Ottawa. One Onondaga chief, Otreouti, whom the French called La Grande Gueule ("the big mouth"), announced in a speech in 1684 that the wars against the Illinois and Miami were justified because [...] "They came to hunt beavers on our lands...". Initially, the French took an ambivalent attitude towards the Iroquois push west. On one hand, having the Five Nations at war with other nations prevented those nations from trading with the English at Albany while on the other hand, the French did not want to the Iroquois become the only middlemen in the fur trade. But as the Iroquois continued to win against the other nations, prevented French and Algonquin fur traders from entering the Mississippi river valley, and the Ottawa showed signs of finally making an alliance with the Five Nations, in 1684 the French declared war on the Iroquois. Otreouti in an appeal for help correctly noted: [...] "The French will have all the beavers and are angry <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>for</b> bringing you any". Starting in 1684, the French repeatedly raided Kanienkeh, burning crops and villages as Louis gave orders to [...] "humble" [...] the Five Nations once and for all, and to teach them to respect the [...] "grandeur" [...] of France. The repeated French raids took their toll with the Mohawk who could field about 300 warriors in the 1670s to able to field only 170 warriors in the summer of 1691. The Iroquois struck back by making raids into New France with the most successful being a raid on Lachine in 1689 that killed 24 Frenchmen while taking 80 captives, but the superior resources of the French state proceeded to grind them down until they finally made peace in 1701.|$|E
