5|$|To reduce {{rolling and}} {{increase}} stability for aircraft operations, a gyrostabilizer {{produced by the}} American Sperry Gyroscope Company was installed. The installation initially proved unreliable as the Japanese technicians <b>were</b> <b>badly</b> trained by Sperry, but eventually the system proved its worth as the technicians gained experience.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{function}} u on {{the unit}} circle T is said to <b>be</b> <b>badly</b> approximable in the weighted space Lp(T, w) if ‖u+ f‖Lp(T,w) ≥ ‖u‖Lp(T,w) for all f ∈ H∞. We prove that if an unimodular function u <b>is</b> <b>badly</b> approximable in Lp(T, w) for all p ∈ (0,+∞) and some non-zero weight w, then u is an inner function. We describe the inner functions Θ and the weights w {{on the unit}} circle T such that Θ <b>is</b> <b>badly</b> approximable in Lp(T, w) for all p> 0. It turns out that, for given inner functions Θ, the class of all weights satisfying the above-mentioned condition depends only on the zero set of Θ. In other words, Θ <b>is</b> <b>badly</b> approximable in Lp(T, w) for all p ∈ (0,+∞) {{if and only if}} B <b>is</b> <b>badly</b> approximable in Lp(T, w) for all p ∈ (0,+∞), where B is a Blaschke product with simple zeros and such that Θ− 1 (0) = B− 1 (0) ...|$|R

5|$|After the Battle of Lake Erie on September 10, 1813, Perry's {{two largest}} ships <b>were</b> <b>badly</b> damaged, and the US Brig Lawrence was {{intentionally}} sunk in Misery Bay. The Lawrence {{was raised in}} 1875 but was burned while {{on display at the}} 1876 Centennial Exposition. The US Brig Niagara was initially repaired, then sunk for preservation in 1820 and raised in 1913, and parts of it were eventually used in the current Niagara, based across Presque Isle Bay in Erie.|$|E
5|$|As the two fleets {{sought to}} regroup, {{individual}} ships encountered enemy ships, {{and there were}} several minor naval skirmishes; two French ships (including d'Estaing's flagship), already suffering storm damage, <b>were</b> <b>badly</b> mauled in these encounters. The French fleet regrouped off Delaware, and returned to Newport on 20 August, while the British fleet regrouped at New York.|$|E
5|$|By 12 February, the Imperial Guards had {{captured}} the reservoirs and Nee Soon village. The defending troops, by this time, <b>were</b> <b>badly</b> shaken.

On the same night, British {{forces in the}} east of the island had begun to withdraw towards the city.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we prove inequalities for multiplicative analogues of Diophantine exponents, {{similar to the}} ones known in the {{classical}} case.

5|$|By now, the {{division}} {{was too weak}} to attempt to reach Frost at the bridge. Of the nine infantry battalions, only one (1st Battalion, The Border Regiment) still existed as a unit, the rest <b>were</b> <b>badly</b> mauled or scattered. Urquhart made the difficult decision to form a defensive perimeter around Oosterbeek, abandoning the 2nd Parachute Battalion. By securing the Driel Ferry Crossing, Urquhart hoped to hold out until XXX Corps could reach them and establish a new bridgehead over the Rhine using the ferry crossing platforms.|$|E
5|$|Five major {{precision}} bombing {{attacks were}} conducted {{as part of}} the Empire Plan. On 9June, two groups of B-29s bombed an aircraft factory at Narao and another two groups raided a factory in Atsuta; both facilities <b>were</b> <b>badly</b> damaged. A single group of Superfortresses also attempted to bomb a Kawasaki Aircraft Industries factory at Akashi but accidentally struck a nearby village instead. The next day, XXIBomber Command bombers escorted by 107 P-51s successfully attacked six different factories in the Tokyo Bay region. Precision bombing raids were also conducted on 22June, when 382 B-29s attacked six targets at Kure, Kakamigahara, Himeji, Mizushima and Akashi in southern Honshu. Most of the factories targeted <b>were</b> <b>badly</b> damaged. Four days later, 510 B-29s escorted by 148 P-51s were sent against nine factories in southern Honshu and Shikoku. Heavy clouds over the region meant that many bombers attacked targets of opportunity individually or in small groups, and little damage was done to the raid's intended targets. Cloudy weather prevented any further large-scale precision attacks until 24July, when 625 B-29s were dispatched against seven targets near Nagoya and Osaka. Four of the factories attacked suffered heavy damage. Renewed cloudy weather prevented any further Empire Plan precision attacks in the last weeks of the war.|$|E
5|$|Less {{successful}} at first were {{the efforts of}} the American battleships to match their British counterparts in excellence of gunnery. Having provided numerous veteran gun-crews to serve aboard armed merchantmen in the previous months, the gunnery complements of Division Nine <b>were</b> <b>badly</b> depleted and filled with inexperienced officers and recent recruits. The inevitable effect of this loss of talent became apparent when, on 17 December 1917, Battleship Division Nine conducted its first full-caliber target practice in nearby Pentland Firth.|$|E

5|$|On 21 January 1985, nine stupas <b>were</b> <b>badly</b> {{damaged by}} nine bombs. In 1991, a blind Muslim preacher, Husein Ali Al Habsyie, {{was sentenced to}} life {{imprisonment}} for masterminding a series of bombings in the mid-1980s, including the temple attack. Two other members of the Islamic extremist group that carried out the bombings were each sentenced to 20 years in 1986, and another man received a 13-year prison term.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of October 27, sentries {{informed}} Magaw that Percy's troops were launching an attack supported by two frigates sailing up the Hudson. Magaw ordered {{an attack on the}} frigates, and both British ships <b>were</b> <b>badly</b> damaged by the guns from Fort Lee and Fort Washington. The frigates could not elevate their own guns to the height of the American positions. The British towed away the frigates, but an artillery duel continued for some time between British and American gunners.|$|E
5|$|Radyr Lawn Tennis Club {{was founded}} in 1914 by 20 Radyr 'Gentlemen', helped by the Earl of Plymouth Estates.

5|$|Somerton {{was hit by}} four Luftwaffe {{bombs on}} the morning of 29 September 1942 during the Second World War. The bombs were aimed at the Cow and Gate milk factory and it was largely destroyed. Ten nearby houses <b>were</b> <b>badly</b> damaged. Nine people were killed and thirty seven injured. A {{memorial}} at the dairy site commemorates those killed. The factory later became a district council depot, and was recently bought by the town council for possible use as the site of a new town hall.|$|E
5|$|The Armada was {{constantly}} being modernized {{with the latest}} developments in naval warfare. It adopted steam navigation in the 1830s, ironclad plate armor in the 1860s, and torpedoes in the 1880s. By 1889, Brazil had the fifth or sixth most powerful navy {{in the world and the}} most powerful battleships in the western hemisphere. The Army, despite its highly experienced and battle-hardened officer corps, was plagued during peacetime by units which <b>were</b> <b>badly</b> paid, inadequately equipped, poorly trained and thinly spread across the vast Empire.|$|E
5|$|The {{claims were}} a massive exaggeration. But while the Big Wing had proven {{physically}} ineffective {{for the most}} part, its biggest contribution to the day had been its use as a psychological weapon. The German bomber units that had seen the Big Wing form up were quite shocked, and those crews in the badly hit units, including KG 2 and KG 3, that had witnessed head-on collisions with German aircraft <b>were</b> <b>badly</b> shaken.|$|E

5|$|The {{day before}} the second Battle of Kellogg's Grove, June 24, Black Hawk was leading his band in an attack on Apple River Fort. During the Battle of Apple River Fort the Sauk besieged the small stockade {{for much of the}} day.

The following day the group would reach Kellogg's Grove where they would engage Dement's militia forces.|$|E
5|$|The first Spanish {{contact with}} the Manche Ch'ol was in 1525, when an {{expedition}} led by Hernán Cortés crossed their territory. From the early 17th century onwards, Dominican friars attempted their concentration into mission towns and their conversion to Christianity. These attempts alarmed their warlike Itza neighbours to the northwest, who attacked the mission towns and fomented rebellion among the Manche. The Manche Ch'ol in the mission towns <b>were</b> <b>badly</b> affected by disease, which also encouraged them to flee the towns.|$|E
