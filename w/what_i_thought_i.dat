But a few weeks ago, I was sent a re-mixed version of my song 'The Long and Winding Road' with harps, horns, an orchestra, and a women's choir added. No one had asked me <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought.</b> <b>I</b> couldn't believe it." [...] The Beatles' usual producer, George Martin, called the remixes [...] "so uncharacteristic" [...] of the Beatles, while Johns, who was denied a production credit by Lennon, described Spector's embellishments as [...] "revolting … just puke".|$|E

Hanks had posted more than 4,000comments over three years, including one in which he described black people as [...] "rabid beasts". Hanks said his postings were designed to gain the trust of Stormfront users to help him write a novel: [...] "I did <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> needed to do to establish myself as a credible white nationalist." ...|$|E

But that's not at all what she had said: her words were being misrepresented so that her message might be more easily attacked. 'She was referring to the complacency of the ratings agencies and investment advisers who say there is nothing to worry about,' said a person at 60 Minutes who reviewed the transcripts of the interview for me, to make sure I had heard <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> had heard. She says there is something to worry about, and it will be apparent to everyone in the next 12 months." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{did not say}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought.</b> Instead <b>I</b> said, [...] "I've {{got that}} tweed suit I wore yesterday. I can put that on if you like." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought.</b> But <b>I</b> {{decided that}} first I {{would listen to}} what the two men had to say. When I got closer to the pair I made another discovery.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{had been}} engaged to him,--without knowing him. Then when I {{found that he}} was not <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> him, <b>I</b> made up my mind {{that it would be better}} to throw him over than make us both miserable for life." ...|$|R
6000|$|PRESS. Ye-es. If I wrote <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>I</b> {{should get}} the sack as quick as you. D'you say that justifies me in {{shedding}} the blood of my boss? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Deed, and I don't know" [...] said Alan. [...] "For just {{precisely}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> {{liked about}} ye, was that ye never quarrelled:--and now I like ye better!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{she replied}} {{somewhat}} formally; [...] "that isn't <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought.</b> <b>I</b> find everything I {{see and hear}} interesting, but there's much I can't understand. One has to feel for its meaning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is exactly}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought.</b> Well, <b>I</b> {{will tell you}} this. Use your warrant: Arrest Mr. Inglethorp. But it will bring you no kudos--the case against him will be {{dismissed}} at once! Comme ca!" [...] And he snapped his fingers expressively.|$|R
5000|$|He {{frequently}} addressed political {{themes in}} his artwork.

60|$|I was paralysed by {{the sight}} of such grief. <b>I</b> don't know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> or <b>what</b> <b>I</b> dreaded. I could only look at him.|$|R
6000|$|... "My little woman," [...] {{said her}} husband, [...] "don't. You make me reproach myself dreadful, when you show such a noble spirit. Sophia, my dear, you don't know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought.</b> <b>I</b> showed it bad enough, no doubt; but what I thought, my little woman!--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We can run away, {{but he can}} not. I {{became very}} angry when I was there, both with her ladyship and that pestilential old clergyman, and told them both pretty much <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought.</b> <b>I</b> have the comfort of knowing that I have two bitter enemies in the house." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will not}} forget our {{appointment}} in Winnipeg," [...] said Haldane, {{as they drove}} away; and I stood still long after the vehicle had melted into the prairie. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> do not remember; but {{it was with a}} dreamy calmness that, now the worst had passed, I returned to Crane Valley.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very true, sir," [...] replied George, {{touching}} his cap, for George was an innately respectful man--respectful to all, though {{with a strong}} tendency to humorous impudence; [...] "very true, sir; that's just <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> when <b>I</b> see you a-meditatin', so I {{went to work at}} once without wastin' any time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Belllounds, I reckon I am," [...] replied Moore, turning white. [...] "I {{did tell}} Columbine <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> she knew--what <b>I</b> {{ought to have}} told long ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|... [Footnote 14: Here {{followed}} in the first edition, [...] "and that I expect not to be excused in any negligence on account of youth, want of leisure, or any other idle allegations." [...] This was inconsistent with his request, {{at the conclusion of}} his preface, that those who condemned his poems would remember his youth when he composed them. After the omitted sentence he had added in the manuscript, [...] "I have ever been fearful of making an ill present to the world, for which I have as much respect as most poets have for themselves. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> incorrect <b>I</b> suppressed; and <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> most finished <b>I</b> never published but with fear and trembling."] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{that was}} just <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> had done," [...] he declared. [...] "What I mean is that after all, {{although}} for my own sake I wouldn't ask a question, it might be as well for you to tell my aunt {{what she wants to}} know. It would make things much more comfortable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I {{told you}} then <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought.</b> <b>I</b> don't think I am a {{particular}} fellow myself {{about money and}} rank {{and that sort of}} thing. I am as poor as a church mouse, and so I shall always remain; and for myself I don't care about it. But for one's sister, Owen--you never had a sister, had you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Melville," [...] she said, [...] "you know I don't understand. I thought--I {{scarcely}} know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought.</b> <b>I</b> {{thought he}} was trivial and foolish to let his thoughts go wandering. I agreed--I see your point--as to the difference in our effect upon him. But this--this suggestion that for him she may be something determining and final-- After all, she----" ...|$|E
60|$|I can't be. Oh, Ronny, I've {{had such}} a rotten time. It came upon me unawares, <b>I</b> didn't know <b>what</b> was happening. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> only liked you.|$|R
6000|$|... "One can't believe {{anything}} they say. That's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> hate. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> Hughs simply knocked her about. I didn't {{know it was}} her jealousy--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did wrong, {{but how do}} {{you know}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> or if <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> {{anything}} at all?" [...] she asked. [...] "You have also avoided the question instead of answering me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And do {{you know}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought?</b> <b>I</b> thought I would part company as soon as I could. I wanted to have my first command all to myself. I wasn't going to sail in a {{squadron}} {{if there were a}} chance for independent cruising. I would make land by myself. I would beat the other boats. Youth! All youth! The silly, charming, beautiful youth.|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess you're on {{the right}} track. He's a pretty smooth talker, your fayther. Just dropped in to see how I be, since his son was interested.

6000|$|... "I {{would have}} broken my arm {{to win that}} game," [...] burst out Wayne. [...] "Miss Huling, I made a blunder yesterday.

6000|$|... 'Indeed, I {{can hardly}} tell,' {{answered}} Lucy; 'I scarcely {{know what to}} think right and <b>what</b> wrong, but <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> might be certain that it was safer to go home.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That," [...] said Jacob Stuck, [...] "is just <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> till <b>I</b> {{found out}} better. It is no common piece of glass, I can tell you.

6000|$|Gab. Just <b>what</b> <b>I</b> say; <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> {{my speech}} was plain: [...] 40 [...] You are no thief--nor I--and, as true men, [...] Should aid each other.|$|R
6000|$|And Janet was impelled {{to make a}} retort {{of almost}} equal crudity:--"If I were a man and saw you in those clothes I wouldn't wait for an introduction.

[...] "I've often told you you were pretty enough without having to wear that kind of thing--to make men stare at you." ...|$|E
6000|$|The knight was touch'd; and in {{his looks}} appear'd Signs of remorse, while thus his spouse he cheer'd: 'Madam, 'tis past, and my short anger o'er!

60|$|He comes no more. There is no eternity of forms. I {{have proved}} it. For {{nearly two years}} now, I have {{remained}} in this chair, and I have not seen him once. True, I was severely tried for a time. But {{it is clear that}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> saw was merely hallucination. He never was. Yet I do not leave the chair. I am afraid to leave the chair.|$|E
6000|$|... "All right. Don't get excited. She {{objects to}} civility, then, from <b>what</b> <b>I</b> understand. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> {{you might have}} been tender. You know we are on service." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I went back. Whether she {{was ever}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> her <b>I</b> do not know--perhaps, I had {{expected}} impossibilities--or those five years {{had made a}} change. We had not an idea that was the same, and the world she lives in {{is one that has}} grown strange to me. They think me slightly crazy--and it is perfectly possible that they are right. Men do lose their mental grip in Africa." ...|$|R
