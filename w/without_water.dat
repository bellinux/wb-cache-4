5|$|Breathing air is {{primarily}} {{of use to}} fish that inhabit shallow, seasonally variable waters where the water's oxygen concentration may seasonally decline. Fish dependent solely on dissolved oxygen, such as perch and cichlids, quickly suffocate, while air-breathers survive for much longer, in some cases in water that {{is little more than}} wet mud. At the most extreme, some air-breathing fish are able to survive in damp burrows for weeks <b>without</b> <b>water,</b> entering a state of aestivation (summertime hibernation) until water returns.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{scarcity}} of water, the Namib Desert Horse sometimes goes <b>without</b> <b>water</b> {{for as long}} as thirty hours in summer and has been known to go close to 72 hours <b>without</b> <b>water</b> during the winter, significantly longer than most horses, even other feral herds. A 1991 study suggested that in 75 years of genetic isolation and water scarcity the population had developed physiological mechanisms which improved their ability to conserve water. In 1993, a second study showed that the physiological water-conservation ability did not differ between Namib Desert Horses and other populations when dehydrated for periods of up to 60 hours, but suggested that the Namib Desert Horse would show improved conservation ability when dehydration periods were extended to upwards of 72 hours, a common occurrence in their feral state.|$|E

5|$|The cyclone dropped {{light to}} {{moderate}} precipitation across Puerto Rico, peaking at 11.13inches (283mm) near Ponce. The rainfall increased levels along several rivers across the island, including the Arecibo Big River which was reported at several feet above flood stage. Its passage left about 79,000people without power and 144,000 <b>without</b> <b>water.</b> In the northern {{portion of the}} island, the rainfall caused a mudslides that buried an automobile, which killed its driver.|$|E

From 1987 to 1990, the band performed the song during tours supporting A Momentary Lapse of Reason, their first album <b>without</b> <b>Waters,</b> who had left the band in December 1985. In 1994 the band performed the song during tours supporting The Division Bell, their second album <b>without</b> <b>Waters.</b> An extended version of the song, again lasting up to twelve minutes, was regularly performed during Gilmour's 1984 US tour in support of his solo album About Face.|$|R

5|$|Before Haruna struck Madagascar, a {{pre-existing}} system produced deadly flooding, {{and when}} the cyclone crossed the country, it added additional rainfall to the region. Flooding was worst in Toliara where a dyke burst, flooding much {{of the town and}} leaving residents <b>without</b> <b>water</b> or power. Many villages in southwestern Madagascar lost access to clean water, prompting various international agencies to deploy teams to decontaminate wells. Haruna destroyed 7,402houses, which left 13,882people homeless. Most of the displaced people were able to leave their shelters by early April. The cyclone damaged rice and maize crops along the coast, although there were extended residual effects when a locust outbreak occurred, affecting half of Madagascar's farmlands by July 2013. Throughout Madagascar, Haruna killed 26people and injured 127 directly, and there were outbreaks of various diseases in the storm's aftermath.|$|E
5|$|By a {{day after}} the storm made landfall, the record power outages were largely restored. However, salt damage {{prevented}} restoration in some areas for several days. The outages left residents temporarily <b>without</b> <b>water</b> after water pumps were shut down. In Hiroshima, lack of power caused traffic congestion, shut down banks, and disrupted hospitals. The widespread power outages related to Mireille prompted the government to reconstruct transmission towers with anemometer, or wind measurement devices. Following the storm, insurance companies paid $6billion to policy holders in Japan, which was a world record related to wind damage; this was surpassed {{less than a year later}} by Hurricane Andrew striking Florida. The typhoon still holds the title as the costliest non-Atlantic hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Damage was {{heaviest}} in Mozambique, {{estimated at}} about $20million (1994USD). Cyclone Nadia severely affected four provinces in the country, primarily Nampula Province where it moved ashore. There, 85% {{of the houses}} were destroyed, and across its path, the cyclone left 1.5million people homeless. High winds caused widespread power outages, left areas <b>without</b> <b>water,</b> and significantly damaged crops, notably the cashew crop. The storm struck before the harvest, and lack of food resulted in 300deaths {{in the months after}} the storm. Across Mozambique, Nadia directly caused 240deaths and injured thousands. Effects spread as far inland as Malawi.|$|E

5|$|Emus drink infrequently, but ingest {{large amounts}} when the {{opportunity}} arises. They typically drink once a day, first inspecting the water body and surrounding area in groups before kneeling down at the edge to drink. They prefer being on firm ground while drinking, rather than on rocks or mud, but if they sense danger, they often stand rather than kneel. If not disturbed, they may drink continuously for ten minutes. Due to the scarcity of water sources, emus are sometimes forced to go <b>without</b> <b>water</b> for several days. In the wild, they often share water holes with kangaroos, other birds and animals; they are wary and tend {{to wait for the}} other animals to leave before they quench their thirst.|$|E
5|$|Herbivores, the nilgai prefer {{grasses and}} herbs; woody plants are {{commonly}} eaten {{in the dry}} tropical forests of India. Studies suggest they may be browsers or mixed feeders in India, whereas they are primarily grazers in Texas. The nilgai can tolerate interference by livestock and degradation of vegetation in its habitat better than deer, possibly because they can reach high branches and do not depend on surface vegetation. The sambar deer and nilgai in Nepal have similar dietary preferences. Diets generally suffice in protein and fats. The protein content of the nilgai's {{should be at least}} seven percent. The nilgai can survive for long periods <b>without</b> <b>water</b> and do not drink regularly even in summer. However, a nilgai died in Dwarka (India) allegedly due to the heat wave and acute shortage of water.|$|E

5|$|Otto and its {{precursor}} disturbance produced days of prolonged {{rainfall and}} gusty winds across the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. Localized flooding and rough sea conditions caused extensive road damage, infrastructure failures, and some beach erosion along coastlines. During {{the passage of}} the storm, numerous residents were left <b>without</b> <b>water</b> and power, and a state of emergency was declared for several Caribbean nations. Schools, businesses and some government offices across all of the Virgin Islands and Saint Kitts and Nevis were closed until storm conditions abated. The weather system ultimately accounted for substantial monetary losses throughout these areas, pinned at over $22million (2010USD). In addition, Otto was widely {{regarded as one of the}} wettest storms in the history of the northeastern Caribbean, repeatedly shattering various rainfall records.|$|E
5|$|Outside of Toamasina, Honorinina damaged {{roads and}} rail lines {{connecting}} {{the city with}} the capital, Antananarivo. Several other roads were damaged by landslides or washouts, and many bridges were damaged. The high winds damaged or destroyed thousands of homes along the storm's path, leaving 83,885people homeless. Many of the damaged homes lost their roofs, which resulted in additional damage when the heavy rainfall affected their interiors. The high winds also damaged many public buildings and factories along its path. The cyclone left widespread areas <b>without</b> <b>water</b> or power; the storm damaged electrical transmission and generation facilities. The high rainfall damaged dykes in Andromba and along the Ikopa and Sisaony rivers. Across the country, Honorinina killed 99people, and caused 424injuries. Damage totaled about $150million (1986USD).|$|E
5|$|Regardless of origin, {{climate and}} culture {{ultimately}} created the Arabian. The desert environment required a domesticated horse {{to cooperate with}} humans to survive; humans were the only providers {{of food and water}} in certain areas, and even hardy Arabian horses needed far more water than camels in order to survive (most horses can only live about 72hours <b>without</b> <b>water).</b> Where there was no pasture or water, the Bedouin fed their horses dates and camel's milk. The desert horse needed the ability to thrive on very little food, and to have anatomical traits to compensate for life in a dry climate with wide temperature extremes from day to night. Weak individuals were weeded out of the breeding pool, and the animals that remained were also honed by centuries of human warfare.|$|E

These animals are well-adapted {{to exist in}} their desert habitat, as they can live <b>without</b> <b>water</b> {{for long periods of}} time. Addax form herds of five to 20 members, consisting of both males and females. They are led by the oldest female. Due to its slow movements, the antelope is an easy target for its predators: lions, humans, African wild dogs, cheetahs, and leopards. Breeding season is at its peak during winter and early spring. The natural habitat of the addax are arid regions, semideserts and sandy and stony deserts.|$|E

Residents scavenged the ruins for fragments of glass that they could stick back together to make windows for themselves. The main sources of income were war profiteering and smuggling, though some were able to find jobs in eastern Slavonia's revived oil industry. Reconstruction was greatly delayed by economic sanctions and lack of international aid.|$|E
