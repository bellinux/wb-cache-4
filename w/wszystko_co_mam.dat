50|$|In August 2005, the Jarocin Festival {{was brought}} back, {{after a few}} years' break. Dezerter {{performed}} there, and again in 2007. In the spring of 2006, the band went {{on a tour of}} Germany (Berlin, Bremen, Hamburg). In 2006, due to the anniversary of Dezerter's 25th years of existence, a double album Punk's Not Jazz was released, with band's most popular songs. In the late 2000s, Dezerter's songs were presented in three Polish films, Dom zły, <b>Wszystko,</b> <b>co</b> kocham, and Beats of Freedom. In June 2010, Mystic Production released band's another album, Prawo do bycia idiotą (The right to be an Idiot).|$|R
5000|$|In {{the next}} {{years after the}} death of Przemko in Siewierz was {{established}} in Lubiąż an excellent epitaph work; Przemko's grave, whose inscription was [...] "Among everything to God and the Nature gave to the Polish, the best was without doubt the prince Przemko" [...] (<b>Wszystko,</b> <b>co</b> Bóg i natura dały Polakom najlepszego, najwznioślejszego, było udziałem księcia Przemka) certainly influenced the imagination of the near inhabitants. The Duke of Ścinawa probably died during the battle, in unclear circumstances. It is doubtful that Władysław I the Elbow-high and Bolesław II of Płock, or any knight, could murder Przemko in cold blood. Another interesting fact was, if Przemko was captured and murdered immediately, his direct relatives never revenged his death. Henry III's politics with Władysław I never exposed an open hostility, which characterize the Duke of Głogów's relations with Henry V the Fat.|$|R
50|$|Nevertheless, the Slovak film {{industry}} did not completely grind {{to a halt}} and important post-Communist era films include Šulík's Everything I Like (Všetko <b>čo</b> <b>mam</b> rád, 1992), and The Garden (Záhrada, 1995), both lyrical films that depict tense father-son relationships, and Vlado Balco's Rivers of Babylon (1998), which is sometimes interpreted as a critical allegory of Mečiar's rise to power. Juraj Jakubisko, working in Prague, made An ambiguous report {{about the end of the}} world (Nejasná zpráva o konci světa, 1997), at the time the most expensive film ever made in the Czech Republic.|$|R
40|$|In {{this report}} I present {{hierarchical}} parallel Markov {{models for the}} creation of interactive social agents for video games and entertainment. The approach extends existing, popular character technologies for social, communicative interaction. First, adding the knowledge of temporal interaction structure enables natural language interaction on a time scale much longer than current chatterbot technologies. Second, adding support for hierarchical interaction decomposition, where an interaction is represented as a collection of smaller, simpler elements, simplifies the authoring of complex engagement. Third, adding support for the concurrent engagement of these elements enables engagement in interleaved, naturalistic communication. The resulting decomposition supports redundancy of representation, graceful performance degradation through the simultaneous engagement of behaviors on different levels of abstraction, and the stochastic approximation mechanism increases robustness in the face of noise and ambiguity. iii In this report, I present the details of hierarchical parallel Markov models, I examine two entertainment agents that use this technique, and explain the implementational details of how such an approach can be used in the development of future systems. iv Rodzicom, Katarzynie i Henrykowi.
