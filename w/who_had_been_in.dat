5|$|In 1042 Grand Prince Yaroslav forced Duke Casimir of Poland {{to settle}} for a {{peaceful}} deal. Casimir recognised Ruthenian control of Red Ruthenia and returned 800 Ruthenian prisoners <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> Polish custody since being captured two decades before by Boleslaw. Peace was secured by two marriages. Casimir was married to Yaroslav's sister, while Casimir gave his own sister Gertruda to Yaroslav's son, Izyaslav.|$|E

Instead of using traditional network casting calls, he spent three months on Broadway, where he found Matthew Morrison, who had previously starred on stage in Hairspray and The Light in the Piazza; Lea Michele, who starred in Spring Awakening; and Jenna Ushkowitz, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the Broadway revival of The King and I.|$|E

5|$|The Australian Test {{team was}} touring South Africa in 1949–50, {{creating}} opportunities for young players back home.

5|$|A {{particular}} {{thorn in}} the side of the Scottish Crown at the turn of the thirteenth century was Haraldr Maddaðarson, Earl of Orkney and Caithness (died 1206). At some point in the last half of the twelfth century, Haraldr put aside his first wife, a daughter of an Earl of Fife, and married Hvarflǫð, a daughter of an Earl of Ross. The latter woman was a member of the powerful meic Áedha, a northern kindred <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> open conflict with the Scottish Crown throughout the twelfth century. Previous Orcadian earls had extended influence into Ross, and it may well have been through Hvarflǫð, and the claims to the earldom that she passed to their children, that drew Haraldr into conflict with the Scots.|$|E
5|$|After {{the victory}} at Romani, Murray moved his {{headquarters}} back from Ismailia on the canal to Cairo. This move to Cairo was to {{enable him to}} be in a more central position to carry out his duties and responsibilities which extended from the Western Frontier Force, waging a continuing campaign against the Senussi in Egypt's Western Desert, to the Eastern Force in the Sinai. Another consequence of the victory was that Major General H. A.

5|$|Among whites, gender nonconformity {{appeared}} {{to be important in}} the development of homosexuality among masculine homosexual women, but not among homosexual women who were not masculine, while adolescent homosexual involvement was important for non-masculine homosexual women but not masculine homosexual women. Bisexual women {{appeared to}} be more influenced by involvement in homosexual genital activities in childhood than exclusively homosexual women, but unlike exclusively homosexual women, their homosexual preference did not appear related to inability to experience heterosexual arousal in childhood. Childhood gender nonconformity appeared more significant for exclusively homosexual women than for bisexual women, and more significant for women <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> psychotherapy than for women who had not.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{association}} between weight and labor market outcomes among legal immigrants to the United States from developing countries using the first nationally representative survey of such individuals.

S. less than five years, but we find no such correlation among men <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the U.

We generally find no significant association between weight and either wages, sector of employment, or work limitations for either women or men. Possible explanations for these findings are discussed. Obesity BMI Weight Wages Employment Disability Immigration Immigrants...|$|R

5|$|Between {{the end of}} the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising (May 1943) and {{beginning}} of 1944, there were between 10,000 and 20,000 Jews hiding in the Ghetto ruins. The number of Robinsons after the Warsaw Uprising has been estimated at between several hundred and two thousand, spread across all the suburbs of Warsaw. Another source gives the number as between 400 and 1,000. Most of those hiding were Jewish, including some <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> hiding since the fall of the ghetto uprising, though a significant number were non-Jewish Poles. Unlike Szpilman, whose case was somewhat unrepresentative, most of those in hiding remained in medium-sized to large groups, often of mixed ethnicities. The majority of the Robinsons were men.|$|E
5|$|Creating the {{new design}} was the {{responsibility}} of Chief Engraver John R. Sinnock, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> his position since 1925. Much {{of the work in}} preparing the new coin was done by Sinnock's assistant, later chief engraver Gilroy Roberts. In early October 1945, Sinnock submitted models to Assistant Director of the Mint F. Leland Howard (then acting as director), who transmitted them to the Commission of Fine Arts. This commission reviews coin designs because it was tasked by a 1921 executive order by President Warren G. Harding with rendering advisory opinions on public artworks.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} 1950s, Hawker Siddeley Aviation (HSA) was keen {{to develop a}} new {{generation}} of combat aircraft that would be capable of supersonic speeds. Unfortunately, despite repeated attempts to revive the program, the in-development Hawker P.1121 fighter would ultimately be left unfinished, principally {{due to a lack of}} a political support for development following the release of the 1957 Defence White Paper by Minister of Defence Duncan Sandys. Recognising the need to promptly commence work on another development program, HSA's chief aircraft designer Sir Sydney Camm, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> regular discussions with Sir Stanley Hooker of Bristol Aero Engines, decided that the company should investigate the prospects of developing and manufacturing a viable combat-capable vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) fighter aircraft.|$|E
