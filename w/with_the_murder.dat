5|$|Felton (Daniel Baldwin) hesitates {{to take a}} new {{murder case}} because he fears it will be too {{difficult}} to solve, so it is taken on by his partner Howard (Melissa Leo), who has recently experienced a perfect streak of solving 11 consecutive cases. They investigate the body of a man dead in a basement, and much to Felton's bewilderment, Howard solves the case easily.

5|$|Gertrude was {{released}} from police custody shortly after the incident. She was sent to Chicago with $7 and was never heard from again.

5|$|Goebel's {{abrasive}} personality {{made him}} many political enemies, but his championing of populist causes, like railroad regulation, also won him many friends. This conflict of opinions {{came to a}} head in the Kentucky gubernatorial election of 1899. Goebel, a Democrat, divided his party with self-serving political tactics at a time when Kentucky Republicans were finally gaining strength, having elected the party's first governor four years previously. These dynamics led to a close contest between Goebel and William S. Taylor. In the politically chaotic climate that resulted, Goebel was assassinated. Everyone charged in connection <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> was either acquitted or eventually pardoned, and the identity of his assassin remains uncertain.|$|E

On June 8, 2004, Goodwin was formally charged <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>murders</b> in Pasadena in Los Angeles County. In October 2006, a Pasadena Superior Court judge ordered Goodwin to stand trial.|$|R
