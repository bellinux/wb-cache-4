50|$|<b>Ice</b> <b>stock</b> sport (also {{known as}} Bavarian Curling) is a winter sport, {{somewhat}} similar to curling. In German, {{it is known}} as Eisstockschießen.

The sport, mostly practised in southern Germany, Austria and Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol in Italy, has been demonstrated at the Winter Olympic Games on two occasions.

40|$|Data {{pertaining}} to the dynamics {{and history of the}} <b>west</b> antarctic <b>ice</b> cover are reviewed and interpreted in terms of a possible inherent instability of the ice cover. A study of pub-lished dat • concerning the past and present ice cover of West Antarctica indicates that during the last few million years the ice sheet has been retreating in stages, each retreat stage being preceded by an advance of comparable duration. Thus disintegration of the <b>west</b> antarctic <b>ice</b> sheet seems to follow the disintegration pattern of other continental ice sheets and may be the last phase of the wo. rldwide Late Cenozoic ice age. At least some of the retreat stages seem to have been rapid enough to be called surges. Stages of advance seem to have temporar-ily introduced equilibrium conditions, since equilibrium ice sheet surface profiles can be reconstructed from the moraines, etc., and thus mark the stable limits of each advance. Present ice sheet surface profiles along flowlines entering both the Ronne and the Ross ice shelves from Marie Byrd Land are not equilibrium profiles, suggesting that the <b>west</b> antarctic <b>ice</b> sheet is unstable. An analysis of the grounded portion of the <b>west</b> antarctic <b>ice</b> cover indicates that data relating to the surface profile, ice velocity, and the mass balance are all incompatible with an equilibrium ice sheet. Instability seems to be centered in the major ic...|$|R
5|$|The Olympic {{program was}} {{adjusted}} {{from that of}} the 1960 Squaw Valley Olympics with the return of bobsleigh and luge after the sports had been skipped {{due to the lack of}} facilities for them in Squaw Valley. Unlike the preceding Games, a demonstration sport, <b>ice</b> <b>stock</b> sport, was incorporated into the 1964 Olympic program. This was the second and most recent occasion on which this sport (a German variant of curling), had been played as a demonstration sport at the Winter Olympics; the first appearance was at the 1936 Winter Olympics. Both men and women participated in the 1964 Games, with twelve women's events incorporated into the program.|$|R
50|$|An {{ice rink}} (or ice skating rink) is a frozen {{body of water}} and/or {{hardened}} chemicals where people can ice skate or play winter sports. Besides recreational ice skating, some of its uses include ice hockey, bandy, rink bandy, ringette, broomball, speed skating, figure skating, <b>ice</b> <b>stock</b> sport and curling as well as exhibitions, contests and ice shows. There {{are two types of}} rinks in prevalent use today: natural, where freezing occurs from cold ambient temperatures, and artificial (or mechanically frozen), where a coolant produces cold temperatures in the surface below the water, causing the water to freeze. There are also synthetic ice rinks where skating surfaces are made out of plastics.|$|R

5000|$|The IPCC AR4 {{estimates}} explicitly {{exclude the}} influence of the melting of ice sheets. These ice sheets include most notably the Greenland ice sheet, and both the east and <b>west</b> Antarctic <b>ice</b> sheets, as well as numerous glaciers. This may result in a major underestimate of the upper limit for sea level rise in the long term. Due to Arctic melting the Greenland ice sheet is particularly vulnerable, and a study by climatologist James E. Hansen states that [...] "we cannot rule out large changes on decadal time-scales once wide-scale surface melt is underway.", the melting of the Greenland ice sheet would result in an increase in sea level rise of over 7m. [...] Melting of the <b>west</b> Antarctic <b>ice</b> sheet would cause a similar, if slightly smaller rise in sea levels due to being grounded below sea level, whilst the effect of the melting of the east Antarctic, although less probable would be an order of magnitude greater.|$|R
