6000|$|All {{this was}} very pleasant, and Miss Stanbury was so happy {{dispensing}} her tea, and the hot cake, and the clotted cream, and was so intent upon her little methods of caressing and petting her niece, that Dorothy had no heart {{to tell her story}} while the plates and cups were still upon the table. She had not, perhaps, cared much for the hot cake, having such a weight upon her mind, but she had seemed to care, understanding well that she might so best conduce to her aunt's comfort. Miss Stanbury was a woman who could not bear that the good things which she had provided for a guest should not be enjoyed. She could taste with a friend's palate, and drink with a friend's throat. But when debarred these vicarious pleasures by what seemed to her to be the caprice of her guests, she would be offended. It {{had been one of the}} original sins of Camilla and Arabella French that they would declare at her tea-table that they had dined late and could not eat tea-cake. Dorothy knew all this,--and did her duty;--but with a heavy heart. There was the story to be told, and she had promised Martha that it should be told to-night. She was quite aware, too, independently of her promise, that it was necessary that it should be told to-night. It was very sad,--very grievous that the dear old lady's happiness should be disturbed so soon; but it must be done. When the tea-things were being taken away her aunt was still purring round her, and saying gentle, loving words. Dorothy bore it as well as she could,--bore it well, smiling and kissing her aunt's hand, and uttering now and then some word of affection. But the thing had to be done; and as soon as the room was quiet for a moment, she jumped up from her chair and began.

He had hundreds of students who came from various locations to study under him. Among them was Fan Ran (范冉). The Sanfu Jue Lu Zhu (三輔決錄注) recorded that when Fa Zhen was still a teenager, he once attended a meeting between {{his father and his}} father's subordinates. After the meeting, Fa Xiong asked his son, [...] "(Among them,) <b>Who</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> a great talent?"

I believe that which is contained on the 77th page of the Book of Mormon, as well as in many other places, in that same book, will be literally fulfilled. The Temple at Jerusalem will undoubtedly be built, by those who believe in the true Messiah. Its construction will be, in some respects different from the Temples now being built. It will contain the throne of the Lord, upon which he will, at times, personally sit, and will reign over the house of Israel for ever. It may also contain twelve other thrones, on which the twelve ancient Apostles will sit, and judge the twelve tribes of Israel." ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{acquisition}} of long-distance questions and the principles of Universal Grammar that govern them (Chomsky 1981; 1986). The questions under investigation are all ones in which a Wh-phrase is moved from an embedded clause, leaving a Wh-trace at the extraction site. Using an elicited production methodology, it is demonstrated that even three-year-old children readily produce a variety of long-distance questions. The methodology is refined to probe children 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge of two principles that constrain production of long-distance questions. One principle governs wanna contraction, prohibiting contraction across a Wh-trace in extracting from infinitival clauses, as in (1). The second principle, the Empty Category Principle (ECP), restricts extraction from {{the subject of a}} tensed embedded clause, ruling out questions like (2) with an overt complementizer (that) :^ (1) *Who do you wanna help you? (cf. Who do you want to help you?) ^ (2) *Who do you think that 2 ̆ 7 s in the box? (cf. <b>Who</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> in the box?) ^ Another methodology, the Truth Value Judgment task, supplements the data from elicited production by studying a constraint that restricts the meanings that can be assigned to long-distance questions. This constraint of 2 ̆ 2 Strong Crossover 2 ̆ 2 prohibits Wh-movement over a pronoun with the same index, ruling out a bound interpretation of the pronoun, as indicated in (3) :^ (3) *Who i does he i think t i has a hat? (cf. Who i thinks he i has a hat?) ^ The findings were that children adhered to the constraints on wanna contraction and Strong Crossover. In extracting from tensed clauses, however, several children consistently produced ungrammatical questions like (2), in apparent violation of the ECP. Other non-adult questions like (4) appeared. I call these 2 ̆ 2 medial-Wh 2 ̆ 2 questions. ^ (4) Who do you think who 2 ̆ 7 s in the box?^ To explain the problematic data, I explore several current formulations of the ECP. A version by Rizzi (1990) is seen to provide a unified explanation of children 2 ̆ 7 s exceptional questions of both kinds. In this framework, these questions are not interpreted as ECP violations but, rather, as attempts by children to preserve the ECP. In sum, the findings support the view that, by three, children have mastered long-distance movement questions and the constraints that apply to them. ...|$|E
