In his autobiography, he described {{the life of a}} miner at some length and mentioned many of the problems such as the sheer hard work, rats, the difficulties of eating and drinking at the coal face, but above all the filth: [...] "We were never really clean. It was unbelievable how we survived. Going home to wash in a tub was the biggest thing. The first time I was in a bath <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> 15".|$|E

However the England bowler, Alec Bedser wrote [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> bowling to Sid at Sydney that I first {{discovered}} that I could move the ball to leg by use of my wrist and fingers...I held the ball in the same manner as a leg-break bowler with the fingers across the seam...and on pitching I was surprised to see the ball go away like a leg-break. It also surprised Sid Barnes". This would make Barnes the first batsman to be dismissed by Bedser's [...] "Special Ball" [...] which would claim Bradman for a duck in the Fourth Test at Adelaide.|$|E
500|$|Israeli actress Hadas Yaron, then aged 20, {{was cast}} {{for the role}} of Shira, the protagonist of the film. She commented that her {{character}} [...] "is much more naïve at 18 than I <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> 18, and there was something so special about that and it was like going back to the basics". Yaron was unfamiliar with Orthodox practice prior to participating in Fill the Void. In order to become better acquainted with Shira's lifestyle, she started memorizing all of the Hebrew blessings, saying, [...] "There's something so beautiful about it because you're being so grateful all the time for everything you do and hoping that everything works out okay and I started doing those blessings every day and it sounds silly but it helps you feel that you are closer to the character." ...|$|E

500|$|John Gielgud's New Theatre {{production}} in 1935 featured Gielgud and Laurence Olivier as Romeo and Mercutio, exchanging roles six {{weeks into the}} run, with Peggy Ashcroft as Juliet. Gielgud used a scholarly combination of Q1 and Q2 texts and organised the set and costumes to match {{as closely as possible}} to the Elizabethan period. His efforts were a huge success at the box office, and set the stage for increased historical realism in later productions. Olivier later compared his performance and Gielgud's: [...] "John, all spiritual, all spirituality, all beauty, all abstract things; and myself as all earth, blood, humanity... I've always felt that John missed the lower half and that made me go for the other... But whatever it <b>was,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> playing Romeo I was carrying a torch, I was trying to sell realism in Shakespeare." ...|$|E
2500|$|A true {{indication}} of how successful the Beatles became thanks to [...] "From Me to You" [...] (though it would soon be overshadowed by [...] "She Loves You" [...] and [...] "I Want to Hold Your Hand") was expressed by McCartney: [...] "The first time I thought we'd really made it, <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> lying in bed one morning, and I heard a milkman whistling 'From Me to You'. Actually, I'm sure that I once heard a bird whistling it as well. I swear I did!" ...|$|E

The origin of the company's name goes back to when Stagliano {{was working as a}} stripper: [...] "There was another guy in one of my shows named John. So this MC started calling me Evil John to {{differentiate}} us. This <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing Dracula and chains.

[...] "I want to be the George Foreman of football, come back and do that one more time... The two teams I would come back to play for are Minnesota or Atlanta. It would probably be Atlanta because that's home for me." [...] According to Walker, his mixed martial arts training made him, [...] "a much better-conditioned athlete now than when I was playing football.

2500|$|Speaking of the {{situation}} in Afghanistan since his visits in 2007, [...] "it's a very different war since I was here a year ago but the fighting with the Taliban is as intense as ever.

In fact, it's actually more dangerous now with the IED threat.". Kemp described how the Taliban had now apparently taken to engaging from a distance, and planting IEDs and mines in areas where troops are likely to take cover, such as in ditches, switching from conventional tactics to a greater use of booby traps and suicide bombers.|$|E

2500|$|Rowling {{stated that}} the {{character}} of Hermione carries several autobiographical influences: [...] "I did not {{set out to make}} Hermione like me but she is...she is an exaggeration of how I <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> younger." [...] She recalled being called a [...] "little know-it-all" [...] in her youth. Moreover, she states that not unlike herself, [...] "there is a lot of insecurity and a great fear of failure" [...] beneath Hermione's swottiness. Finally, according to Rowling, next to Albus Dumbledore, Hermione is the perfect expository character; because of her encyclopaedic knowledge, she can always be used as a plot dump to explain the Harry Potter universe. Rowling also states that her feminist conscience is rescued by Hermione, [...] "who's the brightest character" [...] and is a [...] "very strong female character".|$|E
2500|$|When Lori was {{six years}} old, her mother took her to an agent who {{specialized}} in child actors. She thought that acting might be a healthy outlet for Lori. When later asked what inspired her to be an actress, Martin said, [...] "The best {{time in my life}} <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> about four. Doree and I had to go live with my aunt in Ponca City, Oklahoma. My mother got sick and Daddy had to go to work every day, so we couldn't stay here. I didn't want to come back. I cried and cried. That was when I decided, if I had to come back, I'd be an actress. I started getting parts immediately and my little brother was signed by the same agent, but he lacked my interest in acting. I just loved it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rowling said [...] "I've never thought, 'It's {{time for}} a post-9/11 Harry Potter book,' no. But what Voldemort does, in many senses, is terrorism, and that was quite clear in my mind before 9/11 happened.... but there are {{parallels}}, obviously. I {{think one of the}} times I felt the parallels <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> writing about the arrest of Stan Shunpike, you know? I always planned that these kinds of things would happen, but these have very powerful resonances, given that I believe, and many people believe, that there have been instances of persecution of people who did not deserve to be persecuted, even while we're attempting to find the people who have committed utter atrocities. These things just happen, it's human nature. There were some very startling parallels at the time I was writing it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're right," [...] said Val suddenly; [...] "but things aren't {{what they}} <b>were</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> your age. There's a 'Tomorrow we die' feeling. That's what old George meant about my uncle Soames. HE doesn't mean to die tomorrow." ...|$|R

2500|$|Reportedly, Crumb filed {{a lawsuit}} to have his name removed from the film's credits. San Francisco {{copyright}} attorney Albert L. Morse said that no suit was filed, but an agreement was reached to remove Crumb's name from the credits. However, Crumb's name has remained in the final film since its original theatrical release. [...] In response to his distaste for the film, Crumb had [...] "Fritz the Cat—Superstar" [...] published in People's Comics later in 1972, in which a jealous girlfriend kills Fritz with an icepick; he has refused to use the character again. and wrote the filmmakers a letter saying not to use his characters in their films. [...] Crumb later cited [...] the film as [...] "one of those experiences I sort of block out. The last time I saw it <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> making an appearance at a German art school in the mid-1980s, and I was forced to watch it with the students. It was an excruciating ordeal, a humiliating embarrassment. I recall Victor Moscoso {{was the only one}} who warned me, 'if you don't stop this film from being made, you are going to regret it for the rest of your life'—and he was right." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{situation}} {{was not yet}} lost, England had at least played on the spinning wicket first and it could only get worse for Australia. Doug Wright was the terror of the County Championship for running through side on just such wickets and Hammond also had Peter Smith and the part-time spin of Ikin, Compton and Hutton. Sid Barnes and Arthur Morris only batted for 9 minutes when the rain came down and the teams left the field. On their return Bill Edrich (3/71) made the ball kick up with his fast bowling, and Morris was bowled while taking evasive action. Ian Johnson [...] came in as a nightwatchman and he and Barnes angered the crowd by launching {{into a series of}} bad light appeals - up to 12 were counted - before the umpires gave way and play was ended with an hour to spare. This gamesmanship ensured that Australia would not have to play on a sticky wicket like England at Brisbane and allowed Bradman to rest his leg until play resumed on the Monday. Clif Cary opined in his radio commentary that the light was bright enough to play by and the umpires had been pressured into a decision by the Australian batsmen, as did the English pressmen. They were labelled [...] "biased, unsportsmanlike squealers" [...] and that Barnes and his captain Bradman would never used such underhand tactics, {{but at the end of}} the series Barnes admitted on radio that he had bluffed the umpires into the decision. Sunday was a rest day and the sun dried out the wicket beautifully, it rolled to perfection and produced the flat wicket anticipated on the first day. Barnes had been reprimanded for hooking the ball in the First Test and as a result denied himself strokeplay and slowly ground his way through the day. Johnson was out for 7, and Barnes added 59 with Lindsay Hassett (34) and 63 with Keith Miller (40). Alec Bedser (1/153) [...] bowled well and stopped the runs from getting away, but with defensive fields many catches went begging, but Peter Smith (2/172) failed to find his form (he was hospitalised with appendicitis on the tour). Don Bradman had lowered himself down the order and [...] "limped as if in extreme pain, and several times lay on the ground as if ill" [...] Wright (1/169) “bowled beautifully with the most wretched luck”, in one over [...] "On four occasions Hammond, usually most undemonstrative, threw his hands in the air as the ball beat Bradman and shaved the stumps, and in between these near dismissals there was a confident appeal for leg before wicket. When Bradman was on 22 when he appeared to snick another catch to Jack Ikin at short leg, but [...] "this time there may have been some cause for doubt; it was an appeal that could have gone either way". Bradman was given not out and by the end of the day Barnes was 109, Bradman 52 and Australia 252/4. On the Tuesday Bradman gave [...] "an amazing exhibition in amassing 234 runs - that is, amazing for one who was supposed to be a cripple. He played all the shots, pulled leg muscle and all, and often ran between the wickets with the speed of an Olympic sprinter". Forced to play off the back foot due to his pulled leg muscle Bradman still looked like he had three strokes for every one of Barnes and by the end of the day had caught him up in runs. During this long partnership Len Hutton joked with the crowd on the boundary and ate 14 bananas given to him from the Hill. In desperation Hammond called on his vice-captain Norman Yardley to bowl his medium pacers, which he did not even do for Yorkshire, and to everyone's surprise he caught Bradman lbw for 234. It was only the second time Bradman had been lbw in a Test against England, the first being to Maurice Tate on his debut in 1928. He had added 405 for the fifth wicket with Barnes, and in 1946 this was the highest partnership for that wicket in Test or first-class cricket and the second highest Test partnership after the 451 Bradman-Ponsford partnership at the Oval in 1934. In the next over Barnes hit Bedser to Ikin also for 234, his maiden Test century and the highest score of his career. He said later that he had got himself out so as to have the same score as Bradman [...] "which could well have been so for he was a man of quixotic mood and temperament". However, Alec Bedser wrote [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> bowling to Sid at Sydney that I first discovered that I could move the ball to leg by use of my wrist and fingers...I held the ball in the same manner as a leg-break bowler with the fingers across the seam...and on pitching I was surprised to see the ball go away like a leg-break. It also surprised Sid Barnes". Australia ended the fourth day on 571/6. The next morning the lower order struck out, with Fred Freer hitting 3 fours and a six in his 28 not out and George Tribe 5 fours in his 25 not out until [...] Bradman declared on 659/8.|$|E
