5|$|In response, the United Nations {{began to}} pass a series of resolutions {{demanding}} the withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait. Afraid that Saudi Arabia would be invaded next, the Saudi government requested immediate military aid. As a result, the United States began marshalling forces {{from a variety of}} nations, styled the Coalition, on the Arabian peninsula. Initially, Saddam Hussein attempted to deter Coalition military action by threatening Kuwait's and Iraq's petroleum production and export. In December 1990, Iraq experimented with the use of explosives to destroy <b>wellheads</b> {{in the area of the}} Ahmadi loading complex, developing their capability to destroy Kuwait's petroleum infrastructure on a large scale. On 16 January, Iraqi artillery destroyed an oil storage tank in Khafji, Saudi Arabia, and on 19 January the pumps at the Ahmadi loading complex were opened, pouring crude oil into the Persian Gulf. The oil flowed into the sea at a rate of 200,000 barrels a day, becoming one of the worst ecological disasters to that date.|$|E
25|$|Concerted {{efforts to}} bring the fires and other damage under control began in April 1991. During the {{uncontrolled}} burning phase from February to April, various sources estimated that the burning <b>wellheads</b> burnt through between four and six million barrels of crude oil, and between seventy and one hundred million cubic meters of natural gas per day. Seven months later, 441 facilities had been brought under control, while 308 remained uncontrolled. The last well was capped on November 6, 1991. The total amount of oil burned is generally estimated at about one billion barrels. Daily global oil consumption in 2015 is about 91.4 million barrels; the oil lost to combustion would last 11 days at modern usage rates.|$|E

40|$|This master thesis {{has been}} {{executed}} to analyze methods {{for reducing the}} fatigue of the subsea <b>wellhead</b> system. The subsea <b>wellhead</b> is locked to the seabed with a mobile marine riser indirectly connected to it, thus making the subsea <b>wellhead</b> an exposed part of the well. The bending moments generated combined with the static loads exposed to the subsea <b>wellhead,</b> can generate detrimental stress levels in the subsea <b>wellhead</b> system. Operators dwell on performing interventions due to the fear of fatigue failure in the subsea <b>wellhead,</b> and several wells have been abandoned because of fatigue failure. For several decades and to the present day, solutions and new developments have been presented to reduce the fatigue of the subsea <b>wellhead</b> fatigue. The large focus on subsea <b>wellhead</b> fatigue emphasizes {{the seriousness of the}} issue. The work of this master thesis has consisted in identifying the loads and bending moments affecting the subsea <b>wellhead</b> along with the resulting stresses, and a method for finding the combined effective stress in the subsea <b>wellhead</b> has been elaborated. The traditional subsea <b>wellhead</b> design has been studied, and the fatigue vulnerable areas in the subsea <b>wellhead</b> have been identified. Several methods of reducing subsea <b>wellhead</b> have been studied and analyzed to find the best suited methods of fatigue reduction in the subsea <b>wellhead.</b> A distinction has been made between existing and future wells, as some of the methods are not applicable for existing wells. The work of this master thesis has resulted in an acknowledgement of the importance of proper monitoring and cementing to ensure the reduction of subsea <b>wellhead</b> fatigue. The Force Element has been considered as the most effective method to reduce the subsea <b>wellhead</b> fatigue in existing wells. For future wells, implementation of the Conductor Anchor Node is recommended to keep the fatigue of the subsea <b>wellhead</b> system at an acceptable level. </p...|$|R

When wells are being tested, the atmosphere is usually the environment with constant pressure. The measuring equipment is between the <b>wellhead</b> and the atmosphere. A change in <b>wellhead</b> pressure is executed via throttling on the <b>wellhead</b> valve. An analysis of stability of the system should be carried out taking into account additional resistance between the <b>wellhead</b> and the environment with constant pressure.|$|R

40|$|<b>Wellhead</b> {{growth has}} {{occurred}} in many deep wells in China recently. In the paper, casing axial force and <b>wellhead</b> movement are calculated and compared in regard to moments that free sections of surface casing appear. The parameters considered include preliminary casing tension, free section length and change in wellbore temperature. The moment that surface casing free section comes into being has great influence on <b>wellhead</b> movement, so it is discussed in detail. According to comprehensive investigation on deep well and ultra-deep well accidents, <b>wellhead</b> growth {{is based on the}} fact that before production the cement sheath of surface casing has already failed, and during production <b>wellhead</b> grows up due to wellbore temperature increases. The most possible reason of surface casing cement sheath failure is bad cement job quality. Bad cement sheath cannot support casing axial loads and separates from casing. The free section of surface casing will experience large axial force cycle which is harmful to wellbore integrity. Effective measures to remedy <b>wellhead</b> growth is supporting the <b>wellhead</b> with a large base set on ground, rather than pads fixed on conductor...|$|R

40|$|<b>Wellhead</b> chokes {{are widely}} used in the {{petroleum}} industry. Owning to the high sensitivity {{of oil and gas}} production to choke size, an accurate correlation to specify choke performance is vitally important. The aim of this contribution was to develop effective relationships among the liquid flow rate, gas liquid ratio, flowing <b>wellhead</b> pressure, and surface <b>wellhead</b> choke size using the support vector machines (SVMs). The accurate data set was gathered from the 15 different fields containing 100 production samples from the vertical wells at wide ranges of <b>wellhead</b> choke sizes. This computational model was compared with the previous developed correlations in order to investigate its applicability for subcritical two phase flow regimes through <b>wellhead</b> chokes. Results confirmed amazing capability of the SVM to predict liquid flow rates. The value of R 2 obtained was 0. 9998 for the SVM model.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{assessed}} {{the effects of}} the released oil on microbes, either during or immediately after the Deepwater Horizon accident. However, {{little is known about the}} potential longer-term persistent effects on microbial communities and their functions. In this study, one water column station near the <b>wellhead</b> (3. 78 km southwest of the <b>wellhead),</b> one water column reference station outside the affected area (37. 77 km southeast of the <b>wellhead),</b> and deep-sea sediments near the <b>wellhead</b> (3. 66 km southeast of the <b>wellhead)</b> were sampled 1 year after the capping of the well. In order to analyze microbial community composition, function, and activity, we used metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and mineralization assays. Mineralization of hexadecane was significantly higher at the <b>wellhead</b> station at a depth of ~ 1, 200 m than at the reference station. Community composition based on taxonomical or functional data showed that the samples taken at a depth of ~ 1, 200 m were significantly more dissimilar between the stations than at other depths (surface, 100 m, 750 m, and > 1, 500 m). Both Bacteria and Archaea showed reduced activity at depths of ~ 1, 200 m when the <b>wellhead</b> station was compared to the reference station, and their activity was significantly higher in surficial sediments than in 10 -cm sediments. Surficial sediments also harbored significantly different active genera than did 5 - and 10 -cm sediments. For the remaining microbial parameters assessed, no significant differences could be observed between the <b>wellhead</b> and reference stations and between surface and 5 - to 10 -cm-deep sediments.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{arguments for}} initially producing Geysers steam wells at <b>wellhead</b> pressures {{in excess of}} 200 psig instead of the normal practice of producing at minimum <b>wellhead</b> pressures.

Based on this model, it is argued that producing at elevated <b>wellhead</b> pressures is equal to producing at minimum <b>wellhead</b> pressures, assuming the mass withdrawal is the same. Additional benefits of producing at elevated <b>wellhead</b> pressures are discussed and include minimizing casing and reservoir rock thermal transients and scaling and bridging of the wellbore.
