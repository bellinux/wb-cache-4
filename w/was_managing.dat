5|$|In 1874, Gilbert wrote a short {{libretto}} on commission from producer-conductor Carl Rosa, {{whose wife}} would {{have played the}} leading role, but her death in childbirth cancelled the project. Not long afterwards, Richard D'Oyly Carte <b>was</b> <b>managing</b> the Royalty Theatre and needed a short opera to be played as an afterpiece to Offenbach's La Périchole. Carte knew about Gilbert's libretto for Rosa and suggested that Sullivan write a score for it. Gilbert read the piece to Sullivan in February 1875, and the composer was delighted with it; Trial by Jury was composed and staged {{in a matter of}} weeks.|$|E
5|$|On 2 February 1926, Parliament {{voted to}} nationalise the Trunk Railway. During the debate, the {{organisation}} of Spisevognselskapet was criticised; with the nationalisation, the state became the sole owner of Spisevognselskapet. On 31 March 1927, the Ministry of Labour {{recommended that the}} company remain a state-owned limited company; the minority in parliament wanted a state enterprise. During the 1930s, Sigurd Astrup <b>was</b> <b>managing</b> director of Norsk Spisevognselskap. In 1948, Erling Mossige was appointed {{managing director of the}} company. He was succeeded by Knut Tvedt in 1960. The company had 75 employees in 1919, and 591 in 1949.|$|E

5|$|Texas {{honored the}} Texas horned lizard in 1993, but private Texas Christian University {{has had the}} {{associated}} mascot the Horned Frog since 1896. According to legend, the football team identified with the lizards found on the practice field as the athletes and reptiles were similarly scrappy. The college founder's son, Addison Clark Jr., a faculty member and the initiator of the football team, had been fascinated by the creatures. By 1897, the lizard appeared as a logo {{on the front of}} the school yearbook, which Clark had also started and <b>was</b> <b>managing.</b>|$|E
5|$|When Muñoz Rivera {{was twelve}} years old, his mother fell ill and died. By this time, the family had grown to include nine more siblings, whom he taught. By the age of fourteen, Muñoz Rivera <b>was</b> <b>managing</b> legal documents, working with the local church clergy, and helping in his father's store. There were no {{institutions}} of higher learning on the island at that time, and most families sent their children to Cuba (University of la Habana, founded in 1728), Spain or North America to complete their university education. Muñoz Rivera wanted to travel to Spain and study law, but his father wanted him {{to take care of the}} family's business.|$|E
5|$|While Shay <b>was</b> <b>managing</b> at Kansas City {{in early}} 1910, American Association {{president}} Thomas Chivington imposed new conduct {{rules for the}} league. The new system emphasized fines for players and managers rather than simply ejecting them when they behaved poorly. After Shay was ejected from three games in a four-game span, a Minnesota newspaper article questioned whether his behavior {{would be subject to}} additional disciplinary action. The next month, Shay released 48-year-old Jake Beckley, prompting his retirement after one of the longest careers in professional baseball history. The first baseman had tried to make the Kansas City team after 20 years in the National League.|$|E

5|$|As {{more people}} began to watch Liverpool, the ground {{capacity}} was expanded. The Main Stand was built, which helped to bring regular attendances of around 20,000. Liverpool's stay in the Second Division was brief, as they secured promotion to the First Division during the 1895–96 season – twelve wins in their final fourteen matches gave them a first-place finish, followed by success in the test matches over Small Heath (later renamed Birmingham City) and West Bromwich Albion. The club reached the semi-final of the FA Cup {{for the first time}} in the 1896–97 season; they were drawn against Aston Villa, and with Everton in the other semi-final, there was the prospect of a first all-Merseyside cup final. However, while Everton won their tie, Liverpool were defeated 3–0. After winning promotion, the club appointed Tom Watson, who <b>was</b> <b>managing</b> Sunderland, as their new manager. Watson's record of three League championships in four seasons with Sunderland convinced Houlding to make Watson the highest-paid manager in England, with a yearly salary of £300. Following Watson's appointment, McKenna remained at the club as an administrator.|$|E
5|$|Born in New South Wales but {{raised in}} Western Australia, Phillipps joined the Australian Imperial Force as an infantryman in April 1915, seeing action at Gallipoli {{and on the}} Western Front. Wounded twice in 1916, he {{transferred}} to the Australian Flying Corps (AFC) and was accepted for pilot training in May 1917. As a member of No.2 Squadron in France, Phillipps flew mainly S.E.5 fighters, and was awarded two Military Crosses and the Distinguished Flying Cross for his actions. He finished the war a major, commanding No.6 (Training) Squadron in England. Returning to Australia in 1919, he left the AFC and <b>was</b> <b>managing</b> a rural property when he enlisted in the RAAF soon after the outbreak of World WarII. At his death he was ranked squadron leader, commanding No.2 Elementary Flying Training School at Archerfield, Queensland.|$|E
5|$|Falling {{electricity}} production may be boosted through drilling additional supply boreholes, as at Poihipi and Ohaaki. The Wairakei power station {{has been running}} much longer, with its first unit commissioned in November 1958, and it attained its peak generation of 173MW in 1965, but already the supply of high-pressure steam was faltering, in 1982 being derated to intermediate pressure and the station managing 157MW. Around {{the start of the}} 21st century it <b>was</b> <b>managing</b> about 150MW, then in 2005 two 8MW isopentane systems were added, boosting the station's output by about 14MW. Detailed data are unavailable, being lost due to re-organisations. One such re-organisation in 1996 causes the absence of early data for Poihipi (started 1996), and the gap in 1996/7 for Wairakei and Ohaaki; half-hourly data for Ohaaki's first few months of operation are also missing, as well as for most of Wairakei's history.|$|E

5|$|In January 2010, HMV Group {{announced}} that Waterstones like-for-like sales over the Christmas period were down 8.5 per cent {{on the previous}} year. This culminated in the resignation of managing director Gerry Johnson with immediate effect. He was replaced by development director Dominic Myers, who <b>was</b> <b>managing</b> director of the British academic bookselling chain Blackwells until 2005. Myers joined HMV in 2006 to oversee the integration of Ottakar's into the chain. In response to the decline in sales, he implemented a three-year plan in which branches were tailored to their local market alongside a 'rejuvenation' of the company brand {{and an increase in}} range. As part of these changes, Waterstones implemented new branding in May 2010, developed by agency VentureThree. The company also moved to support the Rainbow Trust, which provides support to children with life-threatening and terminal illnesses and their families, in the same year.|$|E
5|$|Michael Jackson, {{a former}} Motown star who by {{the start of}} {{development}} on The Wiz in 1977, had left Motown for Epic Records with his brothers The Jacksons, was cast as the Scarecrow. Jackson was dedicated to the role, and watched videotapes of gazelles, cheetahs, and panthers in order to learn graceful movements for his part. However Jackson's father Joseph Jackson didn't want him to land the role, as he <b>was</b> <b>managing</b> him at the time, but Jackson refused to listen to his father and decided to be on the movie. Ted Ross and Mabel King were brought in to reprise their respective roles from the stage musical, while Nipsey Russell was cast as the Tin Man. Lena Horne, mother-in-law to Sidney Lumet during the time of production, was cast as Glinda the Good Witch, and comedian Richard Pryor portrayed The Wiz.|$|E

5|$|She {{left home}} in 1990 {{at the age}} of 16, and moved to Melbourne, where she {{qualified}} as a hairdresser and beauty therapist. By 1994 she was running a hair dressing store and managing seven employees. Her life was changed that year by a fall from a building in Melbourne in which fractured her third and fourth thoracic vertebrae, rendering her an incomplete paraplegic. She lay there for forty minutes before someone found her. She spent the next four weeks in the Austin Hospital in Heidelberg, and then another {{two and a half months}} in the Royal Talbot Rehabilitation Centre in Kew. She was forced to move back in with her parents, where she lived for the next five years, but within a year of her accident, she <b>was</b> <b>managing</b> five hairdressing stores.|$|E
5|$|The {{other main}} event was a WWF Championship match between The Ultimate Warrior and Randy Savage. The rivalry between them {{began in the}} fall of 1990, when Sensational Sherri, who <b>was</b> <b>managing</b> Savage, tried to arrange a match between Savage and Warrior. The Warrior refused to defend his WWF Championship against Savage, and he ripped up a {{contract}} that Sherri had given him. While they faced each other at house shows over the next few months, where Savage was unable to win the title, they never had a televised match with each other. Savage then interfered in the title match at Royal Rumble 1991, enabling Sgt. Slaughter to win the title. To settle the rivalry, Savage and the Warrior agreed to face each other in a retirement match at WrestleMania VII. The Warrior won the match, forcing Savage into retirement. However, Savage would be reinstated as an active wrestler in November 1991. The following year, the rivalry was rekindled when the Ultimate Warrior was granted a shot at the WWF Championship, which Savage had won from Ric Flair at WrestleMania VIII on April 5, 1992. Flair and his executive consultant Mr. Perfect, were upset that Flair had not been granted a rematch. They decided to cause trouble between Savage and the Warrior. In August, Perfect claimed that he was in negotiations with Savage and Warrior, who both had sought his managerial services, but refused to clarify which wrestler he would support at SummerSlam. At the SummerSlam Spectacular, a show designed to promote the pay-per-view, Savage and the Warrior teamed up to face The Nasty Boys. Perfect and Ric Flair interfered in the match, resulting in a count-out victory for the Nasty Boys and more animosity between Savage and Warrior.|$|E
