25|$|The Metropolis–Hastings {{algorithm}} {{is the most}} commonly used Monte Carlo algorithm to calculate Ising model estimations. The algorithm first chooses selection probabilities g(μ, ν), which represent the probability that state ν is selected by the algorithm out of all states, given that one is in state μ. It then uses acceptance probabilities A(μ, ν) so that detailed balance is satisfied. If the new state ν is accepted, then we move to that state and repeat with selecting a new state and deciding to accept it. If ν is not accepted then <b>we</b> <b>stay</b> in μ. This process is repeated until some stopping criterion is met, which for the Ising model is often when the lattice becomes ferromagnetic, meaning all of the sites point in the same direction.|$|E
500|$|A lot of {{the special}} was more [...] "edgy" [...] and dark than {{what had been done}} {{previously}} on Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends. A major reason behind this was the peril, danger, and conflict that constructed the plot so heavily. McCracken explains, [...] "When we start a show {{one of the first things}} we think about is tone, is this a goofy one, is it a serious one, whatever it may be <b>we</b> <b>stay</b> true to that tone. This one had some higher stakes so we let it naturally unfold that way. This was the first show/special on Cartoon Network to receive a TV-PG rating." ...|$|E
500|$|Moffat's script {{started by}} repeating Martha's departure. The script {{indicated}} that [...] "this time, <b>we</b> <b>stay</b> with the Doctor. As before ... the Doctor takes a moment, then slam the controls," [...] {{and described the}} Fifth Doctor as having a [...] "frock coat, cricket jersey, and a stick of celery on his lapel". Moffat included several references to Fifth Doctor stories in his script: the Tenth Doctor commented about the Fifth Doctor's attire and his disuse of the sonic screwdriver, saying: [...] "Ooh, I'm the Doctor, I can save the universe with a kettle {{and a piece of}} string and ooh, look at me, I'm wearing a vegetable." [...] A line about the effects of the paradox the TARDIS collision had caused gave an explanation of why the Fifth Doctor looked far older than normal, thus getting around the fact that Peter Davison had left the role over twenty years before. [...] And {{near the end of the}} episode, he refers to Tegan Jovanka, Nyssa, the Cybermen stories Earthshock and The Five Doctors, the Mara serials Kinda and Snakedance, the Time Lords' [...] "funny hats" [...] from Arc of Infinity, and the various Ainley Master stories during Davison's tenure.|$|E

500|$|While El Broide of People Magazine {{wrote that}} the single is {{performed}} in English and French, website Aficia's Valentin Malfroy noted that Spanish is also incorporated, also pointing out a male voice providing vocals for the refrain sung with a strong African accent. However, {{in an interview with}} Romanian station Kiss FM, Inna explained that the chorus is written in a language created by her and her label Global Records, further stating that, [...] "At Global Records, <b>we</b> <b>stay</b> so much together that we don't understand ourselves in Romanian, but also not in any other language. So we thought to create an own language. If the ones from Game of Thrones can do it, then why can't we do it as well?" [...] People Magazine called the track a [...] "catchy" [...] tropical house song that [...] "effortlessly blends together" [...] tropical sounds with a Middle Eastern flair, along with [...] "simple and cheesy" [...] lyrics. Jonathan Currinn from Outlet Magazine labelled [...] "Heaven" [...] an [...] "exotic anthem", while Urban.ro called it a dance-pop song with exotic elements. Radio 21 noted that the track seemed to be influenced by Arabic rhythms.|$|E
500|$|... "18 Miles Out" [...] was {{critically}} acclaimed by television commentators. Bex Schwartz of Rolling Stone opined that the installment {{was an excellent}} and well-written episode, proclaiming that it [...] "balanced zombie action with human drama". In his B grade review for the episode, Zack Halden of The A.V. Club felt that [...] "18 Miles Out" [...] {{was one of the}} second season's more solid attempts; [...] "While there's no question this is still serialized, the story here had a clear beginning, middle, and end, and <b>we</b> <b>stay</b> focused the whole time on two plot arcs: Rick and Shane deciding what to do with Randall [...] while Lori, Maggie, and Andrea deal in their own individual ways with Beth’s desire to kill herself." [...] Halden resumed that it made him hopeful of future installments of The Walking Dead. Matt Barone of Complex, Andrew Conrad of The Baltimore Sun, and IGN's Eric Goldman asserted that [...] "18 Miles Out" [...] was one of the series' best episodes, while The Star-Ledger Mark Mauer thought that it was redundant, ultimately concluding that [...] "it indulged in another subplot centered on a petty argument". Goldman professed that the episodic direction was more focused than previous installments. Concluding his review, he gave the episode a 9.5 out of 10, signifying an [...] "amazing" [...] rating. SFX journalist Ian Berriman echoed analogous sentiments, inevitably issuing [...] "18 Miles Out" [...] a four-and-a-half star rating. He called it the season's best episode, and wrote that it was filled with [...] "action, explosive arguments, [...] difficult decisions".|$|E
500|$|At {{the outset}} of the 2010–11 NHL season, Reimer again was {{assigned}} to the AHL's Marlies. [...] Reimer was not expected to contribute to the Maple Leafs at the NHL level during the 2010–11 season. Expectations for the young netminder were low heading into the season, with head coach Ron Wilson saying [...] "We wanted him to play in the minors and continue to get better, develop and try to stay healthy." [...] He was recalled by the Maple Leafs several months into the season, making his NHL debut on December 20, 2010 in relief of Jonas Gustavsson against the Atlanta Thrashers. [...] He played 14 minutes in the third period, stopping all four shots he faced. [...] Reimer made his first NHL start against the Ottawa Senators on January 1, 2011. [...] The Maple Leafs won the game 5–1, with Reimer recording 32 saves while picking up his first career NHL win. [...] On February 3, 2011, Reimer recorded 27 saves and picked up his first career NHL shutout against the Carolina Hurricanes. [...] A combination of injuries and poor play by Gustavsson and Jean-Sebastien Giguere provided an opportunity for Reimer at the NHL level. [...] His strong play caused the Leafs to carry three goalies on their NHL roster, a fact which did not surprise Giguere, who said [...] "The way he played the last time he was up, you {{knew he was going to}} get another chance." [...] Leafs head coach Ron Wilson acknowledged Reimer as the team's starting goalie as they set out on a late-season run for a playoff spot, saying [...] "It’s going to be his ball the rest of the way. [...] As long as <b>we</b> <b>stay</b> in the race. And I think he’s up to it." ...|$|E

2500|$|The poem [...] "Thermopylae" [...] {{reminds us}} of the famous battle of Thermopylae where the 300 Spartans and their allies fought against the greater numbers of Persians, {{although}} they knew that they would be defeated.

[...] "Fundamentally," [...] he said, [...] "the budget process is about public policy and not about personality and it is important that <b>we</b> <b>stay</b> committed to having an outcome that ensures we have a budget that reflects the values of the people of San Francisco." ...|$|E
2500|$|Million Dollar Bill is an uptempo [...] "pop dance groove" [...] {{with strong}} disco influences. The song lasts {{for three minutes}} and twenty three seconds.

2500|$|Succintly, PROUT {{acknowledges}} that the well-being of individuals lies {{in the development of}} the collective, and that the collective depends on the development of individuals [...] Therefore, in order to understand how a progressive society is to be achieved, Sarkar tries to analyze what it means for a human being to grow and develop. He concludes that physical and psychic development render little progress for a human being as they are subject to deterioration and decay. There are multifarious diseases that affect our body and mind, and even if <b>we</b> <b>stay</b> free of them, eventually time will turn all our physical and mental faculties of no use. Sarkar argues that the only aspect of human life that seems to be subject to no change overtime is it’s transcendental nature, the„supra-emotional values“ intrinsic to the human mind and which exacerbate human multilateral existence.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1983 and 1986, Landy charged about $430,000 annually. When he {{requested}} more money, Carl Wilson {{was obliged to}} give away a quarter of Brian's publishing royalties. In 1988, Wilson said that [...] "Dr. Landy doesn't like {{me to be in}} touch with my family too much. He thinks it's unhealthy." [...] Landy responded to the charges that he exerted too much control on the songwriter: [...] "He's got a car phone in his car. If he wants to call somebody, he calls somebody... He can go anywhere, on his own, anytime he wants." [...] Regarding Wilson's relationship to the Beach Boys at that time, Wilson added: [...] "Although <b>we</b> <b>stay</b> together as a group, as people we're a far cry from friends. One time we were doing an interview together, and the interviewer asked Carl what it was between him and me. He goes, 'Well, Brian and I don't have to talk to each other. We're just Beach Boys, but we don't need to be friends.' And that's true. Although, whenever I think about him, I feel rotten." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1972, Brown {{began an}} {{association}} {{that would result}} in his breakthrough as an internationally successful artist; He was asked by Joe Gibbs to record an album for him, and one of the tracks recorded as a result, [...] "Money in my Pocket", was a hit with UK reggae audiences and quickly became a favourite of his live performances. This original version of [...] "Money in my Pocket" [...] was in fact produced by Winston [...] "Niney" [...] Holness on behalf of Gibbs, with musical backing from the Soul Syndicate. In the same year, Brown performed as part of a Christmas morning showcase in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, along with Delroy Wilson, Scotty, Errol Dunkley, and the Fabulous Flames, where he was billed as the [...] "Boy Wonder of Jamaica" [...] and was considered the star of the show in a local newspaper review. The song's popularity in the UK was further cemented with the release of a deejay version, [...] "A-So <b>We</b> <b>Stay</b> (Money in Hand)", credited to Big Youth and Dennis Brown, which outsold the original single and topped the Jamaican singles chart. Brown and Holness became close, even sharing a house in Pembroke Hall. Brown followed this with another collaboration with Holness on [...] "Westbound Train", which was the biggest Jamaican hit of summer 1973, and Brown's star status was confirmed when he was voted Jamaica's top male vocalist in a poll by Swing magazine the same year. Brown followed this success with [...] "Cassandra" [...] and [...] "No More Will I Roam", and tracks such as [...] "Africa" [...] and [...] "Love Jah", displaying Brown's Rastafari beliefs, became staples on London's sound system scene. In 1973, Brown was hospitalized due to fatigue caused by overwork, although at the time rumours spread that he only had one lung and had only a week to live, or had contracted tuberculosis. He was advised to take an extended break from performing and concentrated instead on his college studies.|$|E
