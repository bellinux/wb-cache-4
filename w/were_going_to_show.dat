Of course, our method of dealing with that was Crow Dog should go take care of Spotted Tail's family, and if he didn't do that we'd banish him from the tribe.

2500|$|In {{her final}} WWF angle, WWF World Heavyweight Champion Ric Flair bragged that he dated Elizabeth before Savage met her. Flair's tagline was, [...] "She was mine {{before she was}} yours." [...] He showed photos of himself with Elizabeth in casual situations, which were later printed in an issue of WWF Magazine. It was later {{revealed}} that the photos were in fact pictures of Savage and Elizabeth, which Flair had doctored. [...] Flair, with Mr. Perfect as his [...] "executive consultant", said that they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> a nude photo of Elizabeth on the screen at WrestleMania VIII, although this did not occur. Nonetheless, Flair's claims set up his WrestleMania VIII match with Savage. During the match, Elizabeth {{made her way to}} ringside, against the wishes of WWF officials. After Savage pinned Flair to win the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, an angry Flair cornered Elizabeth and began to kiss her; Elizabeth slapped Flair away, and Savage began beating Flair until ring officials broke the two up. Elizabeth's final WWF appearance took place on April 19, 1992 during an overseas tour of England; in that match, Savage pinned Shawn Michaels after Elizabeth, who had earlier been sent backstage, returned to prevent Sherri's interference on Michaels' behalf. Despite her departure, the Elizabeth-Flair storyline continued through most of the spring – the most notable highlight was Flair and Mr. Perfect playing a voice mail from a woman identifying herself as Elizabeth, saying she was [...] "waiting at home" [...] and that she [...] "loved" [...] him – until the Savage-Michaels match from England was aired on WWF Prime Time Wrestling in June; the publication of the actual Savage-Elizabeth photos in WWF Magazine came at about that same time.|$|E

60|$|We had strolled {{into the}} church one afternoon, and were looking down its long vista of gloomy pillars (for all these ancient churches built upon the ruins of old temples, are dark and sad), when the Brave came running in, with a grin upon his face that {{stretched}} it from ear to ear, and implored us to follow him, without a moment's delay, as they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> the Bambino to a select party. We accordingly hurried off {{to a sort of}} chapel, or sacristy, hard by the chief altar, but not in the church itself, where the select party, consisting of two or three Catholic gentlemen and ladies (not Italians), were already assembled: and where one hollow-cheeked young monk was lighting up divers candles, while another was putting on some clerical robes over his coarse brown habit. The candles were on a kind of altar, and above it were two delectable figures, such as you would see at any English fair, representing the Holy Virgin, and Saint Joseph, as I suppose, bending in devotion over a wooden box, or coffer; which was shut.|$|E

V diplomski nalogi bomo prikazali, v čem sta si državi podobni in v čem se razlikujeta. Skozi primerjalno analizo bomo prikazali primerjavo infrastrukture med izbranima državama. Infrastrukturo bomo primerjali po dolžini cest, kjer bomo prikazali primerjavo med dolžinami avtocest, državnih cest, regionalnih cest in lokalnih cest. Primerjali bomo tudi deleže v cestnem potniškem prometu in cestnem tovornem prometu. Prav tako bomo prikazali, kako varne so ceste v Franciji in Španiji. Predstavili bomo tudi splošne podatke izbranih držav, BDP, zunanjo trgovino, uvoz in izvoz. Statistične podatke za primerjalno analizo smo pridobili s statističnega urada Evropske unije. Podatke bomo prikazali s tabelami ter jih analizirali in primerjali s komentarjem. The {{essence of}} our thesis is <b>to</b> <b>show</b> the {{infrastructure}} of road traffic in France and Spain.

A new team called the Crusaders Colts were set up to play in the Conference National division and provide a route for young Welsh players to get into the main Crusaders team. They were coached by Dan Clements and eventually came second in the league table, winning 15 out of 18 matches and beating Bramley Buffaloes 26-4 in the Grand Final.

During the meeting, Coralluzzo was elected joint-president of the NWA. After the agreement, Coralluzzo took a dislike to Gordon's Eastern Championship Wrestling (ECW) for their promotion of hardcore wrestling. He would do what he could to limit them including calling fire commissioners on their shows and sending tapes to groups in towns that ECW <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> how violent their matches were. As a result, Coralluzzo managed to get a number of their events cancelled where in response on one occasion Cactus Jack threatened him over the telephone for [...] "taking money from his family".|$|E
