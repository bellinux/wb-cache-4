5|$|We {{all had a}} {{collective}} feeling like we'd had enough {{of this kind of}} shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground {{for the first time and}} in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.|$|E
25|$|The Doctor and Stark {{run down}} to the room where Rivesh and Seruba are, but find that Seruba is cradling Rivesh. She reveals that Azlok has mortally injured him and he is dying. However, Surbua says there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ship that could revive him, but Stark says that {{anything}} found in the ship was stored in the Area 51 vault, which hasn't been entered for some time as something got loose in there. The Doctor, Cassie, Jimmy, Seruba and Stark arrive at the vault, and the Doctor asks Jimmy and Cassie to find the TARDIS back at Dry Springs. Inside the vault, the Doctor and Seruba go {{and look for the}} device they need. Meanwhile, in the Viperox lair Azlok gets the Viperox Queen to release her newly hatched brood, so that they will destroy the whole town. Back in the vault, the Doctor comes across a swarm of Skorpius Flies, a carnivorous alien species that form a group mind. Seruba tells the Doctor she has found the device that could revive Rivesh, but the Skorpius Flies chase after them until the Doctor finds a crate and hides inside. He helps Seruba escape inside the crate by working out how many steps he took on the way in. At the Area 51 base Stark is informed that they are getting reports of Viperox attacks. He orders a row of tanks to block the Viperox off. The Doctor and Seruba shuffle out of the vault inside the crate so the flies won't notice. Meanwhile, Cassie and Jimmy are driving along with the TARDIS on the back of Jimmy's pickup truck when the Viperox burst out of the ground into their path.|$|E
500|$|For {{the first}} scene of the episode, when Jon Snow arises from the table, Weiss stated that [...] "Jon coming back to life <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first, first version we wrote {{originally}} had more talking. And as we saw it on the page written out, we realized {{it was just too}} much dialogue, we decided to just give the kind of awe of that moment its due." ...|$|E

50|$|In {{classical}} logic there are theorems that clearly presuppose that there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> domain of discourse. Consider the following classically valid theorems.|$|R
500|$|A common {{belief in}} Europe {{during this period}} was the Aristotelian idea that the world beyond the Moon and planets was immutable. So {{observers}} argued that the phenomenon <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Earth's atmosphere. However Tycho noted that the object remained stationary from night to night—never changing its parallax—so it must lie far away. He published his observations in the small book De nova et nullius aevi memoria prius visa stella (Latin for [...] "Concerning the new and previously unseen star") in 1573. It is from {{the title of this}} book that the modern word nova for cataclysmic variable stars is derived.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004 a Five TV {{documentary}} team, using cinematic special-effects experts, {{tried to}} convince people that there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> loch. They constructed an animatronic model of a plesiosaur, calling it [...] "Lucy". Despite setbacks (including Lucy falling {{to the bottom of the}} loch), about 600 sightings were reported where she was placed.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{exception}} of The Elephant Man and Dune, which are set in Victorian London and a fictitious galaxy respectively, all of Lynch's films have been set in the United States, and he has stated that [...] "I like certain things about America and it gives me ideas. When I go around and I see things, it sparks little stories, or little characters pop out, so it just feels right to me to, you know, make American films." [...] A number of his works, including Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks and Lost Highway are intentionally reminiscent of the 1950s American culture despite being set in the later decades of the 20th century. Lynch stated that [...] "It was a fantastic decade {{in a lot of}} ways... there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air that is not there any more at all. It was such a great feeling, and not just because I was a kid. It was a really hopeful time, and things were going up instead of going down. You got the feeling you could do anything. The future was bright. Little did we know we were for a disastrous future." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You <b>are</b> right--there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wind," [...] {{said the}} shipowner's son. [...] "I wish {{the captain was}} here, so I could consult with him." ...|$|R
