25|$|Bulgaria {{is rich in}} mineral waters, with 225 {{mineral springs}} and a total {{discharge}} of 5000 l/s, mainly in the south-western and central {{parts of the country}} along the faults between the mountains. Most of them, 148, are situated in southern Bulgaria, while the other 77 are {{in the northern part of}} the country. The springs in the north tend to be with cool water, while those to the south are mainly <b>warm</b> <b>and</b> <b>hot.</b> The hottest spring in Bulgaria and the Balkans is situated in Sapareva Banya and reaches 101.4°C. The Bulgarian word for spa, баня, transliterated as banya, appears in some of the names of more than 50 spa towns and resorts. They are located in several zones: Balkan Mountains zone (Varshets, Shipkovo, Voneshta Voda), Srednogorie zone (Sofia, Ovcha kupel, Bankya, Pancharevo, Strelcha, Hisarya, Banya, Pavel Banya), Maritsa zone (Kostenets (town), Kostenets (village), Dolna Banya, Momin Prohod), Rilo-Rhodope zone (Devin, Velingrad, Banite, Beden, Mihalkovo, Sapareva Banya), Struma zone (Kyustendil, Sandanski, Ognyanovo, Marikostinovo, Dobrinishte).|$|E
2500|$|Dark matter can {{be divided}} into cold, <b>warm</b> <b>and</b> <b>hot</b> {{categories}}. These categories refer to velocity rather than an actual temperature, indicating how far corresponding objects moved due to random motions in the early universe, before they slowed due to cosmic expansion– this is an important distance called the [...] "free streaming length" [...] (FSL). Primordial density fluctuations smaller than this length get washed out as particles spread from overdense to underdense regions, while larger fluctuations are unaffected; therefore this length sets a minimum scale for later structure formation. The categories are set with respect {{to the size of a}} protogalaxy (an object that later evolves into a dwarf galaxy): dark matter particles are classified as cold, warm, or hot according as their FSL; much smaller (cold), similar (warm), or much larger (hot) than a protogalaxy.|$|E

60|$|That night (September 9, 1916), {{they made}} camp a short {{distance}} from the cliffs beside one of the numerous cool springs that are to be found within Caspak, oftentimes close beside the still more numerous <b>warm</b> <b>and</b> <b>hot</b> springs which feed the many pools. After supper the men lay smoking and chatting among themselves. Tippet was on guard. Fewer night prowlers threatened them, and the men were commenting upon the fact that the farther north they had traveled the smaller the number of all species of animals became, though it was still present in what would have seemed appalling plenitude in any other part of the world. The diminution in reptilian life was the most noticeable change in the fauna of northern Caspak. Here, however, were forms they had not met elsewhere, several of which were of gigantic proportions.|$|E

50|$|HVCs are {{typically}} the coldest and densest {{components of the}} galactic halo. However, the halo itself also has a multi-phase structure: cold and dense neutral hydrogen at temperatures less than 104 K, <b>warm</b> <b>and</b> warm-hot gas at temperatures between 104 K and 106 K, <b>and</b> <b>hot</b> ionized gas at temperatures greater than 106 K. As a result, cool clouds moving through the diffuse halo medium {{have a chance to}} become ionized by the <b>warmer</b> <b>and</b> <b>hotter</b> gas. This can create a pocket of ionized gas that surrounds a neutral interior in an HVC. Evidence of this cool-hot gas interaction in the halo comes from the observation of OVI absorption.|$|R
