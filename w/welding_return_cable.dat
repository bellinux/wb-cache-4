40|$|The <b>return</b> <b>cable</b> on the SwePol Link {{has been}} {{introduced}} as an alternative forced by environmentalists {{due to lack of}} social acceptance of other solutions. This is why in the proposed solution water and earth have been replaced by two <b>return</b> <b>cables,</b> although from a technical point of view such a solution is less effective. The last, eleventh fault of the <b>return</b> <b>cable</b> took place on 15 October 2012. In eight earlier cases the faults were caused by electrical failures in the cable in the sea and were located between ten and twenty kilometers from the Polish shore and triggered by disturbances {{in the northern part of}} the Polish power grid. In this situation it has been suggested to analyze and introduce one or two solutions shown below which may significantly limit the effects and lower the costs caused by <b>return</b> <b>cable</b> faults: a) assembly of additional surge arresters b) return to electrodes – lack of <b>return</b> <b>cables</b> c) ”partial” electrodes working with one <b>return</b> <b>cable</b> d) operation of the link only with earthings on converter stations. To sum up it needs to be stated that: • a relatively cheap way of protecting <b>return</b> <b>cables</b> against electrical failures is installing surge arresters in the cabinet located next to the cable container on the Polish shore • from the suggested preventive measures it seems reasonable to introduce the above mentioned solutions a) and d) simultaneously, as both of them are simple solutions which require neither considerable financial expenditure nor authorizations and may quickly show the expected results...|$|R

All the cables are assumed to have the same characteristic impedance in this paper. Note that in practical systems, the conductor and the insulating layer of the metallic <b>return</b> <b>cables</b> can have smaller diameters compared to those of the main cables due to lower requirements on the <b>return</b> <b>cables.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{technology}} used was VSC, capable of black start. Although thyristor-based converters have {{a loss of}} only 0.7%, the IGBTs of VSC get close {{with a loss of}} 0.8 to 1%. Skagerrak 1 and 2 previously used Skagerrak 3 as a <b>return</b> <b>cable,</b> but 1 and 2 were again coupled so that Skagerrak 4 can use number 3 for <b>returns.</b> The <b>cable</b> also supplies 110MW of reserve power. Some of the 24 fiber pairs may be rented for business by telecommunications companies.|$|R
50|$|Since coming online, 11 {{instances}} of cable damage have occurred: {{one on the}} high voltage line and 10 on the <b>return</b> <b>cable.</b> Causes have included ship anchors, fishing nets, fire, and grid power disturbances. On February 14, 2005, the smoothing reactor at the HVDC station at Bruskowo Wielkie was destroyed by fire. Repairs took 20 hours.|$|R
50|$|In August 2011 the {{interconnector}} {{went out}} of service. Repairs were made and the cable became operational again with 450 MW in February 2012. However, further faults meant that {{a major part of}} the interconnector had to be taken out of service until it could be augmented with the additional <b>return</b> <b>cables,</b> completed in 2016. This restored capacity to the full 500MW.|$|R

50|$|In {{response}} to the cost issue of gen 2, the third generation OLEV was developed. The third generation OLEV, uses ultra-slim W-shaped ferrite cores in the primary coil {{to reduce the amount}} of ferrite used to 1/5 of gen 2 and to remove the need of <b>return</b> <b>cables.</b> The secondary coil uses a thicker variation of the w-shaped cores as a way to make up for the lesser area for the magnetic flux to flow through compared to gen 2. Overall, the gen 3 OLEV made up for the gen 1's small margins and gen 2's increased cost.|$|R
50|$|NorGer {{will have}} a {{transmission}} capacity of 1,400 MW and an operating voltage of 450-500 kV. The price per kWh could rise by 0.8 øre in Norway. The sea cable is planned as a bipolar system with earthing through the <b>return</b> <b>cable.</b> This way, the disadvantages of a ground-return electrode with earthing in the sea, such as production of chlorine compounds and metal corrosion, are avoided. Anticipated life span of the cable would be about 40 years. Since the power supply in both Germany and Norway is based on alternating current, converter stations must be built in both countries.|$|R

50|$|Dobie was hopelessly {{attracted}} to the breathtakingly beautiful, but unfailingly greedy, blonde Thalia Menninger (Tuesday Weld). Weld left the series after the first season, and was succeeded by a seemingly endless stream of women (some {{a little older than}} others), for whom Dobie hankered, almost all of whom were almost as hard as Thalia was for Dobie to charm into his arms. Thalia's catchphrase was that the money was not for her, but for her family; she would talk about her father's kidney problem and her sister's loafer of a husband, and claimed her looks were all her family had to obtain money to lift them up in life, but Dobie never quite believed her. <b>Weld</b> <b>returned</b> as a slightly chastened Thalia for a guest appearance in a later season.|$|R

50|$|To fix these issues, KAIST came up {{with the}} {{generation}} 2 OLEV. In the gen 2 OLEV, the current in the primary coil was doubled to create a stronger magnetic field that allows for a larger air gap. The ferrite cores in the primary coils were changed to a U shape and the cores in the secondary coil were changed a flat board shape to pick-up as much flux as possible. This design allows the vertical misalignment to be about 20 cm with a 50% power efficiency. However, the U shaped cores also require <b>return</b> <b>cables</b> which bumps up the cost of production. Overall, the gen 2 made up for the gen 1's margins but, was more costly.|$|R
5000|$|The cable was {{produced}} and laid by Prysmian Group and Nexans SA. [...] The system {{consists of two}} bipolar high-voltage direct current (HVDC) cables with a transmission capacity of 200 MW and an operating voltage of 250 kV of each, and a metal <b>return</b> <b>cable.</b> It has a total transmission capacity of 400 MW. The maximum depth of the submarine cable is 1485 m. It is the second longest submarine power cable after NorNed and the second deepest after SAPEI.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the power loss {{due to the}} sustained arc between primary satellite power cables. If the multi layer insulation (MLI) film on a satellite is electrically floating, energetic electrons in space will charge this film. We carried out an internal pressure measurement of MLI and ESD test on cable with cracks and wrapped with this film. When the negative voltage on the MLI exceeded - 1 kV, a trigger arc discharge occurred between the MLI and the cables. Subsequently, a secondary arc discharge occurred between the cables themselves. In the specific condition, this secondary arc caused sustained arc which burned out the cables. The heat caused by arc tracking between the hot and <b>return</b> <b>cables</b> made them burn out. If this phenomenon had occurred in space, the satellite would have suffered great damage...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} aimed at {{developing}} automated methods to recognize railroad infrastructure from 3 D LIDAR data. Railroad infrastructure includes rail tracks, contact <b>cables,</b> catenary <b>cables,</b> <b>return</b> current <b>cables,</b> masts, and cantilevers. The LIDAR dataset {{used in this study}} is acquired by placing an Optech Lynx mobile mapping system on a railcar, operating at 125 km/h. The acquired dataset covers 550 meters of Austrian rural railroad corridor comprising 31 railroad key elements and containing only spatial information. The proposed methodology recognizes key components of the railroad corridor based on their physical shape, geometrical properties, and the topological relationships among them. The developed algorithms managed to recognize all key components of the railroad infrastructure, including two rail tracks, thirteen masts, thirteen cantilevers, one contact cable, one catenary <b>cable,</b> and one <b>return</b> current <b>cable.</b> The results are presented and discussed both at object level and at point cloud level.
