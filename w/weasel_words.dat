Washington and Cook write that politicians often use <b>weasel</b> <b>words</b> {{as a form of}} spin and propaganda, in order to act as {{if they are going to}} do something about climate change, while in actuality remaining passive on the issue. The authors go on to identify a greater level of denial— within the wider public itself. They argue that society enables denial of climate science through inaction and resistance to the scientific consensus. The authors conclude that if the public stopped denying climate change, the problem itself could realistically be significantly addressed.|$|E

25|$|A <b>weasel</b> <b>word</b> is an {{informal}} term for {{words and phrases}} aimed at creating an impression that a specific and/or meaningful statement has been made, when in fact only a vague or ambiguous claim has been communicated, enabling the specific meaning to be denied if the statement is challenged.

50|$|The {{expression}} <b>weasel</b> <b>word</b> may {{derive from}} the egg-eating habits of weasels. An article published by the Buffalo News attributes {{the origin of the}} term to William Shakespeare's plays Henry V and As You Like It, in which the author includes similes of weasels sucking eggs.

5000|$|A false {{allegation}} can occur {{as the result}} of intentional lying {{on the part of the}} accuser; or unintentionally, due to a confabulation, either arising spontaneously due to mental illness or resulting from deliberate or accidental suggestive questioning, coaching of the child, or faulty interviewing techniques. [...] Researchers Poole and Lindsay suggested in 1997 applying separate labels to the two concepts, proposing the term [...] "{{false allegation}}s" [...] be used specifically when the accuser is aware they are lying, and [...] "false suspicions" [...] (<b>weasel</b> <b>word</b> phrase; dissimulation) for the wider range of false accusations in which suggestive questioning may have been involved.|$|R

40|$|The author’s aim is {{to offer}} some {{critical}} observations on usage of the terms ‘community’ and ‘faith community’. The central argument is that ‘community’ is a <b>weasel</b> <b>word</b> that occurs frequently in discourses at the levels of everyday life, public policy-making, welfare services and social scientific analysis. The article begins by reviewing relatively uncontentious uses of ‘community’. The second section of the article analyses the UK government’s usage of the term ‘faith community’ in policy documents since 1997. And the third section explores two particularly problematic issues: {{on the one hand}} a tension that arises within official discourses about faith communities and, on the other, the UK government’s practice of treating faith communities as if they were undifferentiated collectivities. The conclusion urges sociologists of religion to avoid uncritically reproducing official discourses about faith communities...|$|R

He dissects the aspects of weasel behavior and explores its benefits and ramifications, sometimes referring to his own life experiences.

40|$|Time series (TS) {{occur in}} many {{scientific}} and commercial applications, ranging from earth surveillance to industry automation to the smart grids. An important type of TS analysis is classification, which can, for instance, improve energy load forecasting in smart grids by detecting {{the types of}} electronic devices based on their energy consumption profiles recorded by automatic sensors. Such sensor-driven applications are very often characterized by (a) very long TS and (b) very large TS datasets needing classification. However, current methods to time series classification (TSC) cannot cope with such data volumes at acceptable accuracy; they are either scalable but offer only inferior classification quality, or they achieve state-of-the-art classification quality but cannot scale to large data volumes. In this paper, we present <b>WEASEL</b> (<b>Word</b> ExtrAction for time SEries cLassification), a novel TSC method which is both scalable and accurate. Like other state-of-the-art TSC methods, WEASEL transforms time series into feature vectors, using a sliding-window approach, which are then analyzed through a machine learning classifier. The novelty of WEASEL lies in its specific method for deriving features, resulting in a much smaller yet much more discriminative feature set. On the popular UCR benchmark of 85 TS datasets, WEASEL is more accurate than the best current non-ensemble algorithms at orders-of-magnitude lower classification and training times, and {{it is almost as}} accurate as ensemble classifiers, whose computational complexity makes them inapplicable even for mid-size datasets. The outstanding robustness of WEASEL is also confirmed by experiments on two real smart grid datasets, where it out-of-the-box achieves almost the same accuracy as highly tuned, domain-specific methods...|$|R

In an interview on NBC's Today the following year, Gore said, [...] "I {{did not know that}} it was a fund-raiser. I knew it was a political event, and I knew there were finance people that were going to be present, and so that alone should have told me, 'This is inappropriate and this is a mistake; don't do this.' And I take responsibility for that. It was a mistake." [...] In March 1997, Gore had to explain phone calls which he made to solicit funds for Democratic Party for the 1996 election. In a news conference, Gore stated that, [...] "all calls that I made were charged to the Democratic National Committee. I was advised {{there was nothing wrong with}} that. My counsel tells me there is no controlling legal authority that says that is any violation of any law." [...] The phrase [...] "no controlling legal authority" [...] was criticized by columnist Charles Krauthammer, who stated: [...] "Whatever other legacies Al Gore leaves behind between now and retirement, he forever bequeaths this newest <b>weasel</b> <b>word</b> to the lexicon of American political corruption." [...] Robert Conrad Jr. was the head of a Justice Department task force appointed by Attorney General Janet Reno to investigate Gore's fund-raising controversies. In Spring 2000, Conrad asked Reno to appoint an independent counsel to continue the investigation. After looking into the matter, Reno judged that the appointment of an independent counsel was unwarranted.|$|R

5000|$|However, the NIC’s own {{discussion}} of this paradigm seems to undercut its chances of being effective:Intelligence judgments pertaining to likelihood are intended to reflect the Community’s sense of {{the probability of a}} development or event. ... We do not intend the term “unlikely” to imply an event will not happen. We use “probably” and “likely” to indicate there is a greater than even chance. We use words such as “we cannot dismiss,” “we cannot rule out,” and “we cannot discount” to reflect an unlikely—or even remote—event whose consequences are such it warrants mentioning. Words such as “may be” and “suggest” are used to reflect situations in which we are unable to assess the likelihood generally because relevant information is nonexistent, sketchy, or fragmented.This explanation is ‘a half-step forward, half-step backward.’ An agency-sponsored WEP paradigm is progress. However—an estimative statement that uses “maybe” , “suggest” , or other <b>weasel</b> <b>words</b> is vague and symptomatic of the problem at hand—not its solution.

40|$|It {{seems that}} the {{self-representation}} of the Western world in the contemporary socio-political context {{can only be described}} through a language of English origin. This language is characterized by the use of <b>weasel</b> <b>words.</b> Since language contributes to the construction of reality and, obviously, to its representation, it is evident that the use of <b>weasel</b> <b>words</b> has led and still leads to the construction of a weasel world in which concepts such as “politically correct” and “democracy” lend themselves to be manipulated by groups of power which, in addition to their plans of exponential accumulation of financial capitals, also reveal a hidden agenda. The ideologies of racism and elitism found their “purest” expression in the genocide of the Natives Americans, the Aborigines of Canada and Australia and in the annihilation of enslaved African ethnic groups and their descendants as well as of many minorities such as the deprived or other vulnerable groups.
