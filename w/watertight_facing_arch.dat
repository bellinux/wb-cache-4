2500|$|Earth-fill dams, {{also called}} earthen dams, rolled-earth dams or simply earth dams, are {{constructed}} {{as a simple}} embankment of well compacted earth. A [...] rolled-earth dam is entirely constructed of one type of material but may contain a drain layer to collect seep water. A zoned-earth dam has distinct parts or zones of dissimilar material, typically a locally plentiful shell with a watertight clay core. Modern zoned-earth embankments employ filter and drain zones to collect and remove seep water and preserve {{the integrity of the}} downstream shell zone. An outdated method of zoned earth dam construction utilized a hydraulic fill to produce a watertight core. Rolled-earth dams may also employ a <b>watertight</b> <b>facing</b> or core {{in the manner of a}} rock-fill dam. An interesting type of temporary earth dam occasionally used in high latitudes is the frozen-core dam, in which a coolant is circulated through pipes inside the dam to maintain a watertight region of permafrost within it.|$|R

50|$|The Aggies {{went into}} the season finale <b>facing</b> <b>Arch</b> Rival North Carolina Central with Championship and postseason implications. A&T lost to NCCU 16-21 after a failed {{two-point}} conversion attempt late in the 4th quarter left the Aggies needing a touchdown to win.

North Carolina Central was eliminated as their 0 non-conference FCS division wins removed them from consideration.|$|R
