40|$|To get {{an optimal}} {{plan for a}} logging district, it is {{necessary}} to minimize the total cost per cubic meter. To plan the logging optimally considering different logging sites, various harvesting times and machineries under different costs, the modern algorithms have been developed to solve the forestry problems with different constraints. In this paper, firstly the skidding sites were classified considering the slope constraint for <b>wheeled</b> <b>skidder</b> and tractor. Secondly, the skidding cost, loading and secondary transportation costs were computed per cubic meter and road cost for each node of transportation network of logging district considering three destinations. The best solution was found by shortest path algorithm. The results gave the delivery plan, discounted costs and time plan for logging and road construction for each logging site of the a district under selective cutting. These results help forest engineers easily know; (a) where and when they should log the compartments and what roads they need to build, (b) what would be the costs for each logging site and (c) where the logs of each site should be delivered to...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{operating}} hourly cost of {{the machine}} is a suitable factor to analyze the cost fluctuation certain machinery in a changing environment and to find of economically feasible work concepts for the studied machine system. This paper, {{which is based on}} studies carried out in northern forests of IR-Iran, analyzed and compared costs of four skidding and excavation machines used in timber harvesting and preparing forest roads. Cost calculations were based on the methods used by FAO. Results indicated that the production cost of excavation machines for crawler bulldozer Komatsu D 60 and crawler hydraulic excavator Komatsu PC 220 was 3 3 0. 130 € m and 0. 164 € m respectively. Also, production cost of skidding machines for <b>wheeled</b> <b>skidder</b> 3 3 Timberjak 450 °C and HSM 904 was 1. 320 € m and 2. 940 € m respectively; where the terrain and forest conditions of Iran are moderate, the crawler bulldozer and wheeled Timberjack must be preferred to other equipments, because hydraulic excavator and HSM are too expensive. To conclude, this study reveals that information on the productivity, cost and applications of skidding and excavation machines and systems is a key component in the evaluation of management plans.

40|$|Time {{equations}} {{are derived}} for felling with chainsaw, skidding with cable <b>wheeled</b> <b>skidder,</b> loading with grapple hydraulic loader and trucking of logs within a cut-to-length harvesting method. The continuous time study method {{was applied to}} collect data for felling, skidding, loading and a transportation model. Multiple regression analysis via SPSS software was applied to develop the time models. Felling time {{was found to be}} highly dependent on diameter at breast height. Skidding distance, winching distance, slope of the trail and piece volume were significant variables for the skidding time prediction model. The loading time model was developed considering piece volume. Transportation distance and load volume were used as independent variables in modeling the transportation time. The net production of felling was estimated at 12 trees/h (56. 65 m 3 /h). The net production rates for skidding, loading and traveling averaged 18. 51, 41. 90 and 3. 32 m 3 /h respectively. The total cost of harvesting from stand to mill was estimated 19. 70 €/m 3. The skidding phase was the most expensive component of the cut-to-length method. The bucking and delimbing components were less costly than the other logging phases. The results of this study can be used for harvesting planning and productivity optimization...|$|R

Their origin, range, and type {{is affected by the}} type of machinery, harvesting technology and the machine operator. This paper was focused on the negative impact of three types of forest harvesting technologies to the remaining stand. We considered <b>wheeled</b> <b>skidder</b> technology, and CTL technology with wheeled and tracked chassis. The harvest in stands varied between 21 and 52 %, with an average concentration of felling 13. 7 – 95. 4 m 3 per one skid trail. We observed that the damage rate in stands processed by CTL technology was between 7. 3 and 8. 03 %. Skidder technologies caused damage between 17. 8 % and 44. 6 %. The average size of wound caused by CTL technologies was between 167 and 322 cm 2. Skidder caused damages with area between 395 and 506 cm 2. We also observed differences between damages caused by various types of chassis. CTL technology with tracked chassis caused more damages of timber and tree root system. We used multivariate regression and correlation analyses to evaluate the effect of stand density and intensity of harvest on the intensity of damage.

The effects are mostly negative and result in soil erosion, worsening of soil properties and inhibition {{of the growth of}} roots and soil organisms. In this study, we evaluated forest soil damage caused by the HSM 805 HD <b>wheeled</b> <b>skidder</b> during timber skidding in selected forest stands in the School Forest Enterprise in Zvolen. We estimated the limits for operation of forest machines in the stands and evaluated the moisture content and bulk density of the soil, CO 2 concentration in the upper layer of the soil, determined the soil texture, Atterberg limits and critical moisture using the Proctor test, CBR test and examining the depth of ruts on skid trails. The measurements were taken from undisturbed forest soil unaffected by skidder traffic, the ruts and between the ruts. The results showed significant differences between the values of soil samples from undisturbed soil and the soil affected by the skidder. The exceeding of CO 2 concentration limits and bulk density in the soil from the ruts were recorded in both stands. The methods used present the basic methodology for evaluating the effect of logging machinery on forest soil and for setting limits that will allow or prohibit the operation of logging machinery according to forest stand conditions. The moisture content of soil, when it changes from the solid to plastic phase, was chosen as the limit for machine operation. This value is also easy to measure...|$|R
40|$|The motion {{resistance}} ratio, gross traction {{ratio and}} net traction ratio of a <b>wheel</b> cable <b>skidder</b> were determined and mathematical models derived for three tire inflation pressure values {{with or without}} tire chains on forest road in mountainous conditions. The motion resistance ratio increases {{with the increase of}} tire inflation pressure. On the contrary, the gross traction ratio increases with the decrease of tire inflation pressure. However, when the tires are equipped with tire chains the skidder motion resistance is higher. The motion resistance ratio with tire chains also increases with the decrease of tire inflation pressure due to windage between the tires and chains, which results in lower tractive performance of tire chains. Therefore, by using tire chains, an increase of gross tractive ratio could be achieved, as well as the increase of motion resistance ratio compared to tires without chains. The results of the study show that it is strongly recommended to use tire chains as tightly as possible...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{was carried out}} on the strip road where longitudinal slopes were determined by the leveling method {{as well as individual}} distances of the strip road of uniform slope. Skidders were used for carrying out traction tests in downhill and uphill skidding of 9 different loads. Measurement of wheel loads, wheel torques and components of rope force was performed by tensiometric method and remote transferring of measurement signal. According to the results of research, by the increase of longitudinal slope, more tractive force is used for overcoming the terrain slope than for overcoming the traction resistance. In downhill skidding, the horizontal component of the skidder weight (G sina) acts in the skidder travel direction and hence its value is higher than the traction resistance. Torque distribution depends on the <b>skidder</b> <b>wheel</b> vertical load. In uphill skidding, torques increase proportionally to the vertical component of rope forces and adhesive weight of the skidder. In downhill skidding, the <b>skidder</b> <b>wheel</b> torques are negative, because they are not used for achieving wheel tractive force and instead, the transmission of torque through the transmission system causes skidder’s braking performance. The skidder’s need for braking arises under influence of the horizontal component of the skidder weight (G sina) that acts {{in the direction of the}} skidder travel and under its effect the traction resistances are overcome. It can be concluded that in case of downhill skidding we cannot speak of achieving real tractive force because the skidder pulls the load only by its weight, and the transmittion from engine to wheels is not used for achieving the tractive force...|$|R
40|$|A winch and a sulky can {{transform}} a farm tractor into an effective small-scale logging machine, closely resembling a <b>wheeled</b> cable <b>skidder.</b> The additional cost of these implements is very small, but they offer significant benefits when extracting timber under {{the conditions of}} small-scale forestry. The authors developed a productivity model for skidding timber with wheeled farm tractors, equipped with winch and sulky. The origin data pool contained over 300 individual skidding cycles, extracted from 8 separate tests. Statistical {{analysis of the data}} allowed calculating a simple mathematical relationship for estimating skidding productivity as a function of significant work conditions, such as: piece size, winching distance, tractor power, skidding distance and crew size. This model can provide useful directions to prospective users, contributing to operation planning, costing and optimization. It can predict {{a large proportion of the}} variability in the data and was successfully validated using reserved cycle records, extracted from the same data pool and not used for model development. Depending on tractor power and piece size, the average turn volume and productivity can exceed respectively 2 m 3 per cycle and 4 m 3 per Scheduled Machine Hour (SMH). Top performance can reach 8 m 3 SMH - 1, with heavy tractors and large logs. © 2011 Steve Harrison, John Herbohn...|$|R

Only the impacts resulting from 20 complete trips are presented in this paper. Two tools were tested to determine suitability for use as instruments to predict soil compaction. The Gus probe, a new tool designed for the study utilizing the energy derived from a weight falling through a constant distance to drive a 3. 8 cm (1. 5 in.) diameter foot into the ground, failed to generate useful predictive models. A cone penetrometer, the second tool tested, did generate a significant predictive model. CDO 8 = 0. 2631 - 0. 0001022 (C 16) R 2 7339 where: CDO 8 = the change in soil density, in g/cc, resulting from 20 trips of the logging vehicles, averaged to the 20. 3 cm (8 in.) layer. C 16 = the cone index, in kPa, required to push the cone tip to the 15. 2 cm (6 in.) depth. Graphs of soil densities attained after 20 trips by each machine for the four sites are presented along with curves depicting the change in densities. Greatest compaction resulted from the tractor on the slightly cohesive sites at depths greater than five cm (2 in.) with little differences between machines being observed at the five cm depth. Little differences in compaction were observed between machines at depths greater than five cm on the cohesionless sites. The FMC compacted the loose cohesionless five cm depth the least. The skidder compacted the dense cohesionless site the least. Soil disturbance, defined as a combination of soil displacement and soil compaction, is quantified. The tractor displaced 1. 9 times more soil than the FMC and the skidder displaced 1. 2 times more soil than the FMC. Appropriate equilibrium equations of motion are derived to quantify the pressures along the bottom of the tracks of the tractor and FMC and {{on the bottom of the}} tires of the skidder.

This study was conducted in a completely randomized factorial design and changes in soil bulk density and porosity with the skidder traffic intensity such as low intensity (less than 3 passes), moderate (3 to 7 passes) and very large (more than 7 passes) and two depths of 0 - 10 and 10 - 20 cm of soil were measured. The results showed that with the increase of machine traffic, soil bulk density was increased but the largest percentage increase was observed in initial passes (less than 3 times). Soil bulk density at the depth 0 - 10 and 10 - 20 cm, was more than the control area by 21. 2 and 6. 5 percent, respectively. Soil porosity percentage at wheel rut was decreased comparing to the control area and this reduction in the 0 - 10 cm depth was greater than 10 - 20 cm soil depth.

During planning timber harvesting {{it is very important}} to choose the best possible technology for timber extraction. The use of multi-criteria-decision-making models is a very good way of dealing with various forestry issues especially in terms of choosing the best applicable technology for timber extraction. Modern forest management in the Republic of Croatia in terms of timber harvesting mostly relies on ground based wheeled systems. The goal of this research is to show how the current way of planning timber harvesting (timber extraction) and accordingly the construction of secondary forest road network affects future planning and introduction of »new« technologies for timber extraction i. e. forest cableway.

Damages to trees and soil during late thinning conducted in foothills areas in Poland using tree-length and cut-to-length logging systems were assessed. In both stands, the test plots were located within the primary and secondary skid trails. In the study, areas occupied by skid trails were determined as well as the depth of ruts. In order to determine changes in the soil properties at selected measurement points, a soil penetration resistance and a maximum shearing stress were measured. For each logging system, the share of trees damaged during harvesting operations and location of injuries were determined. The studies have shown that a 70 % larger area was required to form technological trail with CTL than with TL. After CTL, skid trails were scarred by shallow ruts, and the share of ruts with the depth between 0. 16 and 0. 25 was three times smaller than after TL. The average increase in penetration resistance of soil in the ruts after TL was 324 % and 302 % and after CTL 308 % and 220 %, respectively, for primary and secondary skid trail, in comparison to the values obtained in measurement points located 5 m from the trails.
