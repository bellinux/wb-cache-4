Ruth Harrison of FemaleFirst positively reviewed the song, stating that [...] "this track {{is just what}} <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>this</b> summer" [...] and that [...] "t's like a slice of grown up bubblegum pop". Daniel Wilcox of 411mania.com described the song as [...] "a sassy and soulful number {{along the lines of}} Amy Winehouse's bigger singles, only more powerful and sexy, and that much more vocally impressive". Digital Spy music editor Nick Levine wrote that [...] "Mama Do (Uh Oh, Uh Oh)" [...] "is a soulful slice of retro-pop that lands somewhere between the realms of Duffy and Natasha Bedingfield". In a positive review for the BBC Chart Blog, Fraser McAlpine commented that the song [...] "is mined from the same gently retro school of blues that guided Duffy to all those Brit awards earlier in the year". He also wrote that [...] "he melody smacks of a less bleak retelling of Amy Winehouse's 'Back To Black', as performed by the Sugababes".|$|E

60|$|Indeed, {{what most}} needs {{fostering}} through the hundred years to come, {{in all parts}} of the United States, north, south, Mississippi valley, and Atlantic and Pacific coasts, is this fused and fervent identity of the individual, whoever he or she may be, and wherever the place, with the idea and fact of AMERICAN TOTALITY, and with what is meant by the Flag, the stars and stripes. <b>We</b> <b>need</b> <b>this</b> conviction of nationality as a faith, to be absorb'd in the blood and belief of the People everywhere, south, north, west, east, to emanate in their life, and in native literature and art. We want the germinal idea that America, inheritor of the past, is the custodian of the future of humanity. Judging from history, it is some such moral and spiritual ideas appropriate to them, (and such ideas only,) that have made the profoundest glory and endurance of nations in the past. The races of Judea, the classic clusters of Greece and Rome, and the feudal and ecclesiastical clusters of the Middle Ages, were each and all vitalized by their separate distinctive ideas, ingrain'd in them, redeeming many sins, and indeed, in a sense, the principal reason-why for their whole career.|$|E
60|$|Comfortable {{scholars}} and luxurious ladies may content {{themselves with a}} DEAD God, who does not interfere to help the oppressed, to right the wrong, to bind up the broken-hearted; but {{men and women who}} work, who sorrow, who suffer, who partake of all the ills which flesh is heir to--they want a LIVING God, an acting God, a God who WILL interfere to right the wrong. Yes--they want a living God. And they have a living God--even the God who interfered to bring the Israelites out of Egypt with signs and wonders, and a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, and executed judgment upon Pharaoh and his proud and cruel hosts. And when they read in the Bible of that God, when they read in their Bibles the story of the Exodus, their hearts answer, THIS is right. This is the God whom <b>we</b> <b>need.</b> <b>This</b> is what ought to have happened. This is true: for it must be true. Let comfortable folks who know no sorrow trouble their brains as to whether sixty or six hundred thousand fighting men came out of Egypt with Moses. We care not for numbers. What we care for is, not how many came out, but who brought them out, and that he who brought them out was GOD. And the book which tells us that, we will cling to, will love, will reverence above all the books on earth, because it tells of a living God, who works and acts and interferes for men; who not only hates wrong, but rights wrong; not only hates oppression, but puts oppressors down; not only pities the oppressed, but sets the oppressed free; a God who not only wills that man should have freedom, but sent freedom down to him from heaven.|$|E

6000|$|To {{show that}} a faith or a {{philosophy}} is true from every standpoint would be too big an undertaking even for a much bigger book than this; {{it is necessary to}} follow one path of argument; and this is the path that I here propose to follow. I wish to set forth my faith as particularly answering this double spiritual need, the need for that mixture of the familiar and the unfamiliar which Christendom has rightly named romance. For the very word [...] "romance" [...] has in it the mystery and ancient meaning of Rome. Any one setting out to dispute anything ought always to begin by saying what he does not dispute. Beyond stating what he proposes to prove he should always state what he does not propose to prove. The thing I do not propose to prove, the thing I propose to take as common ground between myself and any average reader, is this desirability of an active and imaginative life, picturesque and full of a poetical curiosity, a life such as western man at any rate always seems to have desired. If a man says that extinction is better than existence or blank existence better than variety and adventure, then he {{is not one of the}} ordinary people to whom I am talking. If a man prefers nothing I can give him nothing. But nearly all people I have ever met in this western society in which I live would agree to the general proposition that <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>this</b> life of practical romance; the combination of something that is strange with something that is secure. We need so to view the world as to combine an idea of wonder and an idea of welcome. We need to be happy in this wonderland without once being merely comfortable. It is THIS achievement of my creed that I shall chiefly pursue in these pages.|$|E
60|$|Looking over my scraps, I find I {{wrote the}} {{following}} during 1864. The happening to our America, abroad {{as well as}} at home, these years, is indeed most strange. The democratic republic has paid her today the terrible and resplendent compliment of the united wish of all {{the nations of the world}} that her union should be broken, her future cut off, and that she should be compell'd to descend to the level of kingdoms and empires ordinarily great. There is certainly not one government in Europe but is now watching the war in this country, with the ardent prayer that the United States may be effectually split, crippled, and dismember'd by it. There is not one but would help toward that dismemberment, if it dared. I say such is the ardent wish to-day of England and of France, as governments, and of all the nations of Europe, as governments. I think indeed it is to-day the real, heartfelt wish of all the nations of the world, with the single exception of Mexico--Mexico, the only one to whom we have ever really done wrong, and now the only one who prays for us and for our triumph, with genuine prayer. Is it not indeed strange? America, made up of all, cheerfully from the beginning opening her arms to all, the result and justifier of all, of Britain, Germany, France and Spain--all here--the accepter, the friend, hope, last resource and general house of all--she who has harm'd none, but been bounteous to so many, to millions, the mother of strangers and exiles, all nations--should now, I say, be paid this dread compliment of general governmental fear and hatred. Are we indignant? alarm'd? Do we feel jeopardized? No; help'd, braced, concentrated, rather. We are all too prone to wander from ourselves, to affect Europe, and watch her frowns and smiles. <b>We</b> <b>need</b> <b>this</b> hot lesson of general hatred, and henceforth must never forget it. Never again will we trust the moral sense nor abstract friendliness of a single government of the old world.|$|E
