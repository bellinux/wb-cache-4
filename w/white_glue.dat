2500|$|Controversy arises as {{to health}} {{concerns}} surrounding the questionable classification of gum as food, particularly {{in regard to}} some alternative uses for gum base ingredients. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), chewing gum is considered a food, as the term “food” means “a raw, cooked, or processed edible substance, ice, beverage, or ingredient used or intended for use or for sale {{in whole or in}} part for human consumption, or chewing gum”. Chewing gum is defined as a food of minimal nutritional value. [...] However, many of the ingredients in gum base have uses in inedible products, which raises concern in some consumers. Polyethylene, one of the most popular components of gum base, belongs to a common group of plastics and is used in products from plastic bags to hula hoops. Polyvinyl acetate is a sticky polymer found in <b>white</b> <b>glue.</b> Butyl rubber is typically used in caulking and the lining of car tires, in addition to its role in gum base. Paraffin wax is a byproduct of refined petroleum.|$|E
2500|$|Archaeologists have {{discovered}} a variety of artifacts from the wet site. [...] Items including: basketry, cords, a variety of fishing hooks, a 3,000-year-old fishnet (which is constructed from split spruce boughs), tiny stone blades (with their original cedar handles still intact), wood working tools, anchor stones with binding, various hafted microliths (such as fish knives) and micro blades, carved wood art, a variety of wooden objects, animal bone, shellfish remains, and plant remains. [...] The abundance of flatfish, roundfish, rockfish, and over 400 wooden offshore-fishing hooks found in the wet site suggest the presence of fisheries. [...] The water at the wet site preserved artifacts {{that would have been}} lost under normal conditions. [...] These items required particular care and were treated with an aqueous solution consisting of 50% <b>white</b> <b>glue</b> in order to keep them intact. Archeologists have also studied large vegetal mats at the wet site. [...] Each layer in the mat represents 10 to 20 years elapsed. [...] At least 45 of the layers found are from 3000 to 2600 B.P. [...] These mats are also of interest as a means of analyzing the flora present at the time the site was inhabited.|$|E

50|$|White had a {{hands-on}} influence on Ovation. White {{used to come}} to the factory. His fingernails were brittle and prone to cracking, a condition that got worse as he grew older. Ovation's subassembly foreman, Al Glemboski, made a cast of White's fingers, from which he made a set of fiberglass nails. <b>White</b> <b>glued</b> on these false nails with an industrial glue, Eastman 910, which would later be marketed as Super Glue. He returned to the factory every other month for a new set of nails.|$|R
2500|$|The {{majority}} of glued joints in the instrument use animal hide glue rather than common <b>white</b> <b>glue</b> {{for a number}} of reasons. Hide glue is capable of making a thinner joint than most other glues, it is reversible (brittle enough to crack with carefully applied force, and removable with very warm water) when disassembly is needed, and since fresh hide glue sticks to old hide glue, more original wood can be preserved when repairing a joint. (More modern glues must be cleaned off entirely for the new joint to be sound, which generally involves scraping off some wood along with the old glue.) Weaker, diluted glue is usually used to fasten the top to the ribs, and the nut to the fingerboard, since common repairs involve removing these parts. The purfling running {{around the edge of the}} spruce top provides some protection against cracks originating at the edge. It also allows the top to flex more independently of the rib structure. Painted-on [...] purfling on the top is usually a sign of an inferior instrument. The back and ribs are typically made of maple, most often with a matching striped figure, referred to as flame, fiddleback, or tiger stripe.|$|E

50|$|The {{traditional}} {{method of}} making papier-mâché adhesive {{is to use}} a mixture of water and flour or other starch, mixed to the consistency of heavy cream. Other adhesives can be used if thinned to a similar texture, such as polyvinyl acetate-based glues (wood glue or, in the United States, <b>white</b> Elmer's <b>glue).</b> Adding oil of cloves or other additives such as salt to the mixture reduces the chances of the product developing mold.|$|R

40|$|The {{efficient}} {{implementation of}} synthesis concepts into robust and reproducible emulsion polymerization processes requires a reliable process control, ideally also {{with respect to}} an inline monitoring of polymer nanoparticle growth. If critical process parameters like e. g. emulsification of the monomers, particle formation, colloidal stability during processing, heat flux, and viscosity are monitored inline and continuously, an increased understanding of the polymerization process is achieved, resulting in safe and cost-optimal processes and feedback control strategies. For example, polyvinylacetate based dispersion adhesives (<b>white</b> <b>glues)</b> are usually modified with functionalized comonomers to control glue properties like viscosity, pH, film formation, hydrophobicity, and adhesive strength (via crosslinking). However, the modification will also influence process characteristics like particle nucleation and growth or polymerization rates. Technologies which provide information about these features might improve process control and hence product quality. To date {{only a limited number}} of process analytical technologies, suitable for high concentrations of nanoparticles, exist. The recently developed Photon Density Wave (PDW) spectroscopy allows for the precise and calibration-free characterization of the optical properties of particles and droplets during their processing. Its fundamental benefit - the quantitative separation of light absorption and light scattering - enables particle sizing also in highly concentrated polymer dispersions (> 40 vol%), in diameter ranges of approx. 50 nm 500 µm. The contribution will introduce PDW spectroscopy and discuss its benefits based on the monitoring of polymerization processes like the synthesis of highly concentrated functionalized polyvinylacetate adhesives...|$|R
50|$|A {{quick way}} to make casein {{painting}} medium is to take some skim milk cottage cheese and first wash off any of the milky fluids. The lumps of casein left behind are then dissolved by adding, in a pot, water and some ammonia. The ammonia should be preferably {{in the form of}} ammonium carbonate. As the mixture is stirred while it warms it begins to froth and the lumps dissolve. It is not boiled but kept simmering and stirred until the frothing stops. After the syrup is cooled, that is the medium. It looks like <b>white</b> school <b>glue</b> or heavy cream. It keeps in a refrigerator for about four days.|$|R

5000|$|On a more petty level, it was {{marred by}} accusations of [...] "damage, theft, {{vandalism}} and pranks". The General Accounting Office (GAO) estimated the cost of those pranks at $13,000 to $14,000. They included graffiti in the men's bathroom at the <b>White</b> House, <b>glue</b> smeared on desk drawers, and missing doorknobs, medallions, and office signs. However, they note that similar pranks were reported in prior transitions, including the one from Bush's father to Clinton in 1993. Press secretary Ari Fleischer followed up the GAO report with a White House-produced list of alleged vandalism including removal of the W key from keyboards.

40|$|A simple protocol, {{based on}} Bligh–Dyer (BD) {{extraction}} followed by MALDI-TOF-MS analysis, for fast identification of paint binders in single microsamples is proposed. For {{the first time}} it is demonstrated that the BD method is effective for the simultaneous extraction of lipids and proteins from complex, and atypical matrices, such as pigmented paint layers. The protocol makes use of an alternative denaturing anionic detergent (RapiGestTM) in order to improve efficiency of protein digestion and purification step. Detection of various lipid classes, such as triacylglycerols (TAGs) and phospholipids (PLs), and their oxidation by-products was accomplished, whereas proteins could be identified by peptide mass fingerprinting. The effect of pigments on ageing of lipids and proteins was also investigated. Finally, the proposed protocol was successfully applied to the study of a late- 15 th century Italian panel painting allowing the identification of various proteinaceous and lipid sections in organic binders, such as egg yolk, egg <b>white,</b> animal <b>glue,</b> casein, and drying oil. ...|$|R
40|$|Due {{to their}} huge future {{potential}} in identification, monitoring, and sensor applications, textile-integrated radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags {{have been an}} active topic of research during the recent years. A passive, battery-free RFID tag is composed of an antenna and an integrated circuit (IC) and, when integrated into a textile material, offers a cheap, unobtrusive, and completely maintenance-free wireless platform for versatile body-centric systems. One of the key challenges to be addressed, before the large-scale deployment of these textile RFID components, is their ability to withstand continuous washing, which {{has been found to}} be a major reliability issue and is currently actively studied. This thesis presents a washing reliability study of passive UHF RFID textile tags with three different coating materials. The tag antennas were fabricated by brush-painting silver ink on a 100 % cotton fabric. After attaching the ICs, the ready RFID tags were fully coated with three different protective coating materials: regular textile <b>glue,</b> <b>white</b> epoxy coating, and silicone rubber. The coated tags were washed 15 times in a household washing machine and tested wirelessly after each washing cycle for the total of 15 washing cycles. Before washing, all tags exhibited good performance and attainable read ranges of about 10 meters, under the European RFID emission regulation. Based on the reliability test and the done measurements, all three protective coating materials can successfully protect the RFID tags from the effects of washing and especially the textile glue was found to be suitable coating for the brush-painted tags. Silicon rubber also can be said as a suitable coating. <b>White</b> epoxy <b>glue</b> coating does make the tags water resistant but it is constantly losing its ability of protection after each washing cycle and, in the long run, it can be said that it does not make the tags washable...|$|R

5000|$|... === Treatment === Once a close {{observation}} reveals what {{issues are}} present in insect collections, the conservator makes a decision on actions to be taken. It is highly preferable that any treatment applied be reversible or done with little risk to the specimen. For example, broken limbs may be glued back on, which has traditionally been done with <b>white</b> <b>glue.</b> The advantage to <b>white</b> <b>glue</b> being that it is removable in warm water. Another common problem is pest infestation. When dried insect collections have suffered an infestation, the affected specimens can be frozen or sealed with inert gases to kill the pests without harming the specimens. Other treatments might include simply refilling wet specimens' jars with alcohol to ensure the specimens are completely submerged, cleaning specimens of dust and debris, or repositioning specimens for display or research. In the case that a specimen needs to be repositioned, the conservator will [...] "relax" [...] the specimen in a jar with a rehydrating substrate to move the limbs without breaking them. The technique used will vary among conservators. Some use a relaxing jar that the specimen is left in for days with the substrate of choice, others may choose to use a warm water bath with a drop of detergent. Whatever treatments are used are diligently documented.|$|E
