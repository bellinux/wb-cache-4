25|$|In {{contrast}} to the case method some schools use a skills-based approach in teaching business. This approach emphasizes quantitative methods, in particular operations research, management information systems, statistics, organizational behavior, modeling and simulation, and decision science.

As long as the company draws its accounts up to within four days of a mean accounting date each year, it may, {{for the purposes of}} determining its accounting periods, deem its accounts to be drawn up for a twelve-month period. For example, when there is a 371-day period of account, instead of having one accounting period of 365 days (in a non-leap year) and another of 6 days, it <b>will</b> <b>prepare</b> its return {{on the assumption that the}} period of account was 365 days long.|$|E
25|$|Queen's Campus was {{established}} in 1992 and {{is located in the}} town of Thornaby-on-Tees some 30 miles away from Durham City. The Campus is currently home to around 2,000 full-time students, two residential colleges (John Snow and Stephenson Colleges) and the Wolfson Research Institute. A bus connects Queen's Campus to Durham City, with a one-way journey usually taking 45 minutes. The colleges and academic departments are to be relocated to Durham City (or transferred to Newcastle University {{in the case of the}} School of Medicine, Pharmacy and Health) between 2017 and 2018, with the Queen's Campus being repurposed as an International Study Centre, to be run by Study Group.

25|$|Emergency {{vehicles}} are sent on runs {{by a number}} of means. The most common system is by pager, issued to every crew. Pagers may operate on either an analog or a digital system. Analog pagers will silently listen on the air for a 5-tone signal being transmitted. Once the individual signal for that pager is detected, the pager will sound an alarm, and will often open the channel for the crew to hear the dispatcher. Further information is being given via radio. The digital pagers will listen on a different channel and once its individual address is transmitted, <b>will</b> <b>prepare</b> to receive a data package. This package normally consists of a short message, providing the address and nature of the emergency as well as additional information. This clears the radio channel of lengthy calls. Theoretically, no additional radio traffic is required when using such a system.|$|E

They will also learn and be prepared with physical and personal development which will help them with physical, personal, and health factors in the arts fields as an introduction to workplaces; integration of elements and principles of art which will deepen their understanding about art elements and principles and their applications; building cultural and national identity in arts which will help them appreciate cultural icons and traditional or indigenous materials, techniques, and practices in their art field. Students also will be immersed to an art field of their choice: music, theater, literary art, visual art, or media art under apprenticeship with practitioner/s {{of the field and}} will culminate showcasing their skills and talents in either a performing arts performance, a visual and media art exhibit, or a literary art production.|$|E
