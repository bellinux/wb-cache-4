Vivid Entertainment founder and co-chairman Steven Hirsch {{said in a}} statement that he is pleased with the decision regarding the enforcement questions, but plans to appeal the part of the ruling that upholds the measure. He stated, [...] "We won most everything we sought to be determined unconstitutional with Measure B. We are, however, disappointed the Court found it necessary to rewrite a portion of the measure in order to salvage a small portion of the measure and refused, at this time, to accept the adult industry’s own regulations by imposing an unfunded mandate upon the county by AHF." [...] AIDS Healthcare Foundation president Michael Weinstein stated, [...] "Today’s ruling that requiring condoms in porn is constitutional is just a tremendous, tremendous victory, one that <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way to safeguard the health and safety of those adult performers working in the industry."

50|$|Although the {{resolution}} encourages and promotes universal WMD treaty implementation, states {{not yet a}} party retain their prerogative not to sign these treaties.

States <b>will</b> have <b>gone</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way toward complying with {{the resolution}} if they have already ratified the three main WMD treaties, but the reverse is also true. If States put the required national legislation in place to comply with UNSCR 1540, then becoming state party of and complying with the CWC and the BTWC will not demand much additional effort. In this way the resolution also contributes to treaty universality.|$|R

If this distinctive flag can be accepted by the country without lasting bitterness and acrimony, then Canadians <b>will</b> have <b>gone</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way to prove to the world that a nation such as ours, born in strife, diverse in its origins, speaking two languages and being the embodiment of two great cultures, can survive and prosper....|$|R

25|$|Sussex won the toss at the Oval {{and elected}} to bat. Mark Ramprakash captained Surrey as Mark Butcher {{has still not}} {{recovered}} from the injury that saw him miss England's winter tour. Only 49 overs could be bowled on the first day, as rain delayed the start till after lunch, and bad light brought an early conclusion. Cloud cover helped the bowlers, but Sussex, thanks to Michael Yardy's 44 not out, finished the day on 171 for 4. The second day saw 61 overs. Yardy, again under cloud-covered skies, progressed to 111, which <b>will</b> have <b>gone</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way to helping him cement a regular first team place. Rikki Clarke, who took 4 for 91, appears a yard quicker than last season, and to have improved after his poor season last year. Sussex finished the second day on 370, and Surrey on 6 for 1.|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{effectiveness}} of fundraising strategies for not for profit social welfare organizations using the CG Msipa Scholarship as a case study. Literature on fundraising strategies for not for profit strategies was reviewed in order to identify the gap in theory and practice this study would address. The literature was extracted from textbooks and journals. Data was collected from trustees and administrator of the CG Msipa Scholarship Trust through the use of questionnaires and structured interviews. The collected data was analyzed, interpreted and presented using narratives, tables and pie charts. The study revealed that the strategies currently employed by CG Msipa Scholarship Trust to raise resources to support its objectives are ad hoc and are not very effective. The researcher recommends that the CG Msipa Scholarship Trust formulates a written and well researched fund raising plan not only to guide the trustees and administrators in fundraising initiatives but <b>will</b> also <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way in developing very strong relationships with existing and prospective donors...|$|R

I have no doubt now that Ruth Powlett somehow holds the key of this strange mystery in her hand, and I think that what you have said to her to-day <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way towards inducing her to unlock it.

40|$|Crimes by {{and against}} police {{officers}} during {{the performance of}} their duties are treated differently. If a police officer unlawfully harms a citizen, regular assault or homicide charges apply, whereas if a citizen unlawfully harms a police officer, aggravated assault or homicide charges apply. The enhancement {{stems from the fact that}} the citizen interfered with police activity. No one would dispute that states have a special interest in protecting this kind of important state-sanctioned behavior. But do they not also have an equal interest in deterring its abuse through commensurate charges? This Essay is the first to tackle this asymmetry and explore potential rationales for it. It argues that the unique duties of police officers—and their related ability to use force or deadly force—point to the need for uniform aggravated statutes that regulate both sides of the encounter. The recent shootings by and against police officers over the last few years highlight the importance of this kind of reform. Making a change along these lines <b>will</b> ultimately <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way to help legitimate police activity in this context...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the food {{security}} situation in three most deprived and poverty-stricken regions in the Northern parts of Ghana and examines how farmer households cope during food insecure periods. The study concludes that although farmers in these regions cultivate purposely for household consumption and sell the surplus, food was not available throughout {{the year in the}} farmer households interviewed. On the average staple foods produced lasted for seven months. Coping mechanisms during months of inadequate household food provision included migration to southern Ghana for wage labor, support from relatives and friends outside the regions, sales from livestock and household valuables as well as reduction of food intake and consumption of less preferred food. Erratic rainfall patterns, high cost of agrochemicals, lack of knowledge on improved farming and post harvest practices as well as lack of production credit and markets for farm produce were some of the constraints militating against increased production and improvement in food security. Measures to remove these constraints <b>will</b> therefore <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way to improve the household food security situation in Northern Ghana...|$|R
