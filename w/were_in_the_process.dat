5|$|As the Canadians began {{preparations}} for an assault, the Germans <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of executing an assault plan of their own. The XIII (Royal Württemberg) Corps spent six weeks planning and carefully preparing their {{attack on the}} Mount Sorrel, Tor Top (Hill 62) and Hill 61 peaks. Their objective was {{to take control of}} the observation positions east of Ypres and keep as many British units as possible pinned down in the area, to avoid them transferring to the Somme front and assisting with the observed build-up in that area. The Germans constructed practice trenches resembling the Canadian positions near Tor Top to rehearse the assault, well behind their own lines.|$|E

By 6August 2014, ABSA had received 200 claims, Standard Bank had received 129 claims and Mutual & Federal had received 11 claims. A survey of 17 insurance companies done by finance website Justmoney showed that 5 out of the 17 companies surveyed would reject insurance claims related to the earthquake if it was proven to be mining-related. In {{a response to the}} Survey, ABSA, who was on the list of 5, affirmed that they have received approximately 1100 claims and <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of finalising them.|$|E

Five D3As also joined the CAP around this time. Another trio of Zeros were launched at 08:30.

5|$|Nazi Germany had at its {{disposal}} fifty {{divisions in}} France and the Low Countries, with another eighteen stationed in Denmark and Norway. Fifteen divisions <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of formation in Germany. Combat losses throughout the war, particularly on the Eastern Front, meant that the Germans {{no longer had a}} pool of able young men from which to draw. German soldiers were now on average six years older than their Allied counterparts. Many in the Normandy area were Ostlegionen (eastern legions)– conscripts and volunteers from Russia, Mongolia, and other areas of the Soviet Union. They were provided mainly with unreliable captured equipment and lacked motorised transport. Many German units were under strength.|$|E

5|$|Subsequent {{measurements}} of Vega at 193μm showed a lower than expected flux for the hypothesized particles, {{suggesting that they}} must instead be {{on the order of}} 100μm or less. To maintain this amount of dust in orbit around Vega, a continual source of replenishment would be required. A proposed mechanism for maintaining the dust was a disk of coalesced bodies that <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of collapsing to form a planet. Models fitted to the dust distribution around Vega indicate that it is a 120AU-radius circular disk viewed from nearly pole-on. In addition, there is a hole {{in the center of the}} disk with a radius of no less than 80AU.|$|E

The Hessian brigades did not attack, as they were waiting for the pre-arranged signal from the British, who <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of outflanking the American lines at that time. The Americans were still under the assumption that Grant's attack up the Gowanus Road was the main thrust, and Sullivan sent four-hundred of his men to reinforce Stirling.|$|E

5|$|The basic {{staples of}} the Maya diet were maize, beans, and squashes. These were {{supplemented}} {{with a wide}} variety of other plants either cultivated in gardens or gathered in the forest. At Joya de Cerén, a volcanic eruption preserved a record of foodstuffs stored in Maya homes, among them were chilies and tomatoes. Cotton seeds <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of being ground, perhaps to produce cooking oil. In addition to basic foodstuffs, the Maya also cultivated prestige crops such as cotton, cacao and vanilla. Cacao was especially prized by the elite, who consumed chocolate beverages. Cotton was spun, dyed, and woven into valuable textiles in order to be traded.|$|E

After ordering the others to their hometowns, Sudirman made his way to Jakarta and met with President Sukarno, who asked him to lead resistance against Japanese forces in the city. Unfamiliar with Jakarta, Sudirman refused, instead offering to lead forces in Kroya. He left for his former command on 19August 1945. At the same time, Allied forces <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of retaking the Indonesian archipelago for the Netherlands. The first British forces arrived on 8September 1945.|$|E
