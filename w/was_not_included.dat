5|$|A {{contrasting}} analysis {{conducted by}} Rauhut and Carrano in 2016 found slightly different relationships within Noasauridae.

Velocisaurus, Noasaurus and Masiakasaurus were the only taxa within Noasaurinae, as Laevisuchus and Deltadromeus were placed basal to the group of Noasaurinae and Elaphrosaurinae within Noasauridae.|$|E

He was booed when he was substituted for Paco Alcácer later in the match. Del Bosque defended Costa from criticism, saying that he performed well against the Slovak defence. However, he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>included</b> in the final squad for the tournament.|$|E

5|$|Except for its two stations—one at {{each end}} of the tunnel—the line ran entirely underground. The line was built in less than three months, and on its {{completion}} in 1936 was one of the shortest independent railway lines in the country. It was open for only three years before being converted to a major air-raid shelter during World War II. After the war's end, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>included</b> in the 1948 nationalisation of British railways but remained in private hands.|$|E
5|$|Girl Pat left Grimsby on 1 April 1936.

Instead, he proposed to take the boat south, first calling at Dover where he would get rid of Jefferson, who <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>included</b> in his further plans. At this stage Orsborne was apparently undecided as to his longer-term intentions, but indicated that they would be sailing into southern waters and might go fishing for pearls.|$|E

5|$|Ilokelesia was {{originally}} {{described as a}} sister group to Abelisauroidea. However, Sereno tentatively places it closer to Abelisaurus than to noasaurids, a result which agrees with several other recent analyses. If a stem-based definition is used, Ilokelesia and Rugops are therefore basal abelisaurids. However, as they are more basal than Abelisaurus, they are outside of Abelisauridae if the node-based definition is adopted. Ekrixinatosaurus was also published in 2004, so it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>included</b> in Sereno's analysis. However, an independent analysis, performed by Jorge Calvo and colleagues, shows {{it to be an}} abelisaurid.|$|E
5|$|In June 2012 Chapman <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>included</b> in {{the final}} 18–player Great Britain squad for the 2012 London Olympics.

He wrote over 100 pieces, but much of it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>included</b> in the game. The team wrote enough music as to fill eight megabits of the 24 megabit cartridge—about two compact discs.|$|E
