25|$|The actual {{temperature}} in a drying kiln is the dry-bulb temperature (usually denoted by Tg), {{which is the}} temperature of a vapour-gas mixture determined by inserting a thermometer with a dry bulb. On the other hand, the wet-bulb temperature (TW) {{is defined as the}} temperature reached by a small amount of liquid evaporating in a large amount of an unsaturated air-vapour mixture. The temperature sensing element of this thermometer is kept moist with a porous fabric sleeve (cloth) usually put in a reservoir of clean water. A minimum air flow of 2m/s is needed to prevent a zone of stagnant damp air formation around the sleeve (Walker et al., 1993). Since air passes over the wet sleeve, water is evaporated and cools the wet-bulb thermometer. The difference between the dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures, the <b>wet-bulb</b> <b>depression,</b> is used to determine the relative humidity from a standard hygrometric chart (Walker et al., 1993). A higher difference between the dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures indicates a lower relative humidity. For example, if the dry-bulb temperature is 100°C and wet-bulb temperature 60°C, then the relative humidity is read as 17% from a hygrometric chart.|$|E
50|$|The <b>wet-bulb</b> <b>depression</b> is the {{difference}} between the dry-bulb temperature and the wet-bulb temperature. If there is 100% humidity, dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures are identical, making the <b>wet-bulb</b> <b>depression</b> equal to zero in such conditions.|$|E
50|$|Evaporative cooling is most {{effective}} when the relative humidity is on the low side, limiting its popularity to dry climates. Evaporative cooling raises the internal humidity level significantly, which desert inhabitants may appreciate as the moist air re-hydrates dry skin and sinuses. Therefore, assessing typical climate data is an essential procedure to determine the potential of evaporative cooling strategies for a building. The three most important climate considerations are dry-bulb temperature, wet-bulb temperature, and <b>wet-bulb</b> <b>depression</b> during the summer design day. It is important {{to determine if the}} <b>wet-bulb</b> <b>depression</b> can provide sufficient cooling during the summer design day. By subtracting the <b>wet-bulb</b> <b>depression</b> from the outside dry-bulb temperature, one can estimate the approximate air temperature leaving the evaporative cooler. It is important to consider that the ability for the exterior dry-bulb temperature to reach the wet-bulb temperature depends on the saturation efficiency. A general recommendation for applying direct evaporative cooling is to implement it in places where the wet-bulb temperature of the outdoor air does not exceed 22 °C (71.6 °F). However, in the example of Salt Lake City, the upper limit for the direct evaporative cooling on psychrometric chart is 20 °C (68 °F). Despite this lower value, this climate is still suitable for this technique.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1998 Volatile organic {{emissions}} (VOCs) {{from the}} kiln drying of lumber are {{of concern to}} government, research agencies, and the forest products industry. In the Pacific Northwest, neither the quantity of VOC emissions from kilns drying Douglas-fir is available, nor the effects of drying schedule and lumber-related characteristics on the emissions. This research presents a reference for industrial permits and pollution regulations. An experimental set-up based on EPA Method 25 A was made to obtain the total hydrocarbon (THC) emissions from 15 laboratory kiln charges of 2 " by 6 " Douglas-fir lumber. Dryer temperatures ranged from 160 °F to 200 °F with initial <b>wet-bulb</b> <b>depressions</b> from 10 °F to 20 °F. For the typical schedule starting at 180 °F with a 165 °F wet-bulb temperature, the unit THC emission, from green to a 12...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{preliminary}} scoping study done {{as part of}} the {open_quotes}Alternatives to Compressive Cooling in California Transition Climates{close_quotes} project, which has the goal of demonstrating that houses in the transitional areas between the coast and the Central Valley of California do not require air-conditioning if they are properly designed and operated. The first part of this report analyzes the climate conditions within the transitional areas, with emphasis on design rather than seasonal conditions. Transitional climates are found to be milder but more variable than those further inland. The design temperatures under the most stringent design criteria, e. g. 0. 1 % annual, are similar to those in the Valley, but significantly lower under more relaxed design criteria, e. g., 2 % annual frequency. Transition climates also have large day-night temperature swings, indicating significant potential for night cooling, and <b>wet-bulb</b> <b>depressions</b> in excess of 25 F, indicating good potential for evaporative cooling. The second part of the report is {{a preliminary}} assessment using DOE- 2 computer simulations of the effectiveness of alternative cooling and control strategies in improving indoor comfort conditions in two conventional Title- 24 houses modeled in various transition climate locations. The cooling measures studied include increased insulation, light colors, low-emissivity glazing, window overhangs, and exposed floor slab. The control strategies studied include natural and mechanical ventilation, and direct and two-stage evaporative cooling. The results indicate the cooling strategies all have limited effectiveness, and need to be combined to produce significant improvements in indoor comfort. Natural and forced ventilation provide similar improvements in indoor conditions, but during peak cooling periods, these will still be above the comfort zone. Two-stage evaporative coolers can maintain indoor comfort at all hours, but not so direct evaporative coolers...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNew {{research}} on evaporative cooling and breathable walls has demonstrated {{the potential for}} smart designs where conductive, convective, and radiative heat fluxes are matched or supplemented through low-energy natural phenomena such as <b>wet-bulb</b> temperature <b>depression</b> associated with evaporation. This research seeks to examine the operational and theoretical performance of novel vapor permeable evaporative cooling membrane layers. Latent heat is removed through the evaporation of water through the membrane, where contaminants remain in solution as the hydrophobic membrane allows for passage of only water vapor. Through steady-state analysis of a proposed cooling system for building exterior walls, cooling capacity was shown to exceed cooling loads for large indoor areas. Candidate materials produced from recycled glass were examined through sintering, hydrophobing, and other processes to create materials with the requisite properties specified by simulations. Real data acquired for Princeton, NJ from July 2011 was inputted to the simulations to quantify behavior of the system under real conditions. Even in the humid climate of New Jersey in July, the system can supplement a conventional cooling system, acting as a buffer between interior and external environments. Additionally, the novel mathematical model developed to simulate this evaporative process is in 0. 04 ± 0. 28 °C agreement to measured data...|$|R
50|$|Temperature: If the {{relative}} humidity is kept constant, {{the higher the}} temperature, the higher the drying rate. Temperature influences the drying rate by increasing the moisture holding capacity of the air, {{as well as by}} accelerating the diffusion rate of moisture through the wood.The actual temperature in a drying kiln is the dry-bulb temperature (usually denoted by Tg), which is the temperature of a vapour-gas mixture determined by inserting a thermometer with a dry bulb.

40|$|Oregon white oak, Quercus garryana Dougl., {{could have}} greater {{commercial}} use, but information on its drying properties is lacking. All oaks {{are difficult to}} dry, and the initial kiln conditions are important to prevent excessive surface checking and honeycombing. This study illustrated that a maximum dry-bulb temperature of 110 F with a <b>wet-bulb</b> <b>depression</b> of 4 F is required to reduce checking and must be maintained until the average moisture content is 40 percent or lower. The second stage of drying required a dry-bulb temperature of 110 F with a depression of 6 F and is held until the average moisture content is 30 percent. The drying conditions are set to promote drying until the equalization period, which is a dry-bulb temperature of 180 F and a <b>wet-bulb</b> <b>depression</b> of 35 F. This {{is followed by a}} conditioning period, which is a dry-bulb temperature of 180 F with a <b>wet-bulb</b> <b>depression</b> of 10 F.

40|$|During steady rain, {{the ceiling}} lowers in a {{discontinuous}} fashion. The ceiling heights may be predicted with sufficient accuracy {{by using a}} set of empirically determined rules. To obtain a relation for the time of occurrence of these ceilings, the factors which influence cloud formation are considered. An expression is derived for the rate of moisture increase due to evaporation from falling raindrops. The rate of moisture change, given by this expression, is combined with {{the effect of the}} other factors in order to obtain a formula which may be applied to find the time a ceiling of given height will occur. The variables in the forecast formula are (1) the <b>wet-bulb</b> temperature <b>depression</b> measured before the start of rain and (2) F,, the effective rate of moisture increase caused by factors other than evaporation. Values for F, are found empirically. An approximate method, based on the surface value of the depression, is used for finding the time of occurrence of the 800 -, 500 -, and 300 -foot ceilings. This approximate method appears to be best suited for forecasting the 500 -foot ceiling. formula for the rate of downward growth of the fractocumuli forming underneath the rain cloud during steady precipitation.

40|$|To {{prevent the}} unintentional {{transfer}} of insects and pathogens during world trade, wood products are often heat sterilized. The general requirement {{is that the}} center of the wood configuration be held at 133 °F (56 °C) for 30 min. However, many factors can affect the time required to reach this temperature. This study explored several of these factors, including thickness of boards or cross-sectional dimension of square timbers, <b>wet-bulb</b> <b>depression,</b> and stacking method (solid or stickered). The heating temperature used was 160 °F (71 °C). Heating time increased with increasing board thickness or increasing cross-sectional dimension. It also increased as <b>wet-bulb</b> <b>depression</b> increased because of surface cooling when simultaneous drying occurred at significant wet-bulb depressions. Solid piling increased heating time by a factor ranging from 2 to 10 compared with stickered piling, depending on species and size. This study also looked at developing an analytical method to predict heating time as a function of heating variables. Multiple regression was successful as a prediction tool as a function of wood size, wetbulb depression, and initial wood temperature as long as the wet-bulb temperature in the heating chamber was higher than the target center temperature. The multiple regression results were used to create 99 % upper confidence levels on estimated heating times...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{activity}} {{in the development of}} future weather data for building performance simulation follows recognition of the limitations of traditional methods, which have been based on a stationary (observed) climate. In the UK, such developments have followed on from the availability of regional climate models as delivered in UKCIP 02 and recently the probabilistic projections released under UKCP 09. One major area of concern is the future performance and adaptability of buildings which employ exclusively passive or low-energy cooling systems. One such method which can be employed in an integral or retrofit situation is direct or indirect evaporative cooling. The effectiveness of evaporative cooling is most strongly influenced by the <b>wet-bulb</b> <b>depression</b> of the ambient air, hence is generally regarded as most suited to hot, dry climates. However, this technology {{has been shown to be}} effective in the UK, primarily in mixed-mode buildings or as a retrofit to industrial/commercial applications. Climate projections for the UK generally indicate an increase in the summer <b>wet-bulb</b> <b>depression,</b> suggesting an enhanced potential for the application of evaporative cooling. The paper illustrates this potential by an analysis of the probabilistic scenarios released under UKCP 09, together with a detailed building/plant simulation of case study building located in the South-East of England. The results indicate a high probability that evaporative cooling will still be a viable low-energy technique in the 2050 s. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{study of}} the soil moisture-rainfall {{feedback}} uses a dataset beginning in 1981 of bi-weekly neutron probe measurements of soil moisture at up to 19 stations in Illinois to show that soil moisture can {{play a significant role}} in maintaining drought or flood conditions during the summer. Results of a linear correlation analysis between initial soil saturation and rainfall in the subsequent three weeks showed that a positive correlation between these two variables is present from early June through mid-August. This correlation is more significant than the serial correlation within precipitation time series, suggesting the likelihood of a physical mechanism linking soil moisture to subsequent rainfall. This result prompted further investigation into the nature of such a physical pathway linking soil moisture to subsequent rainfall. Near-surface hourly observations of pressure, P, temperature, T, wet-bulb temperature, T., and relative humidity,f, from 13 stations in and close to Illinois were used in these analyses.

In phase 1, two hundred and fifty-six (256) Southern pine (pinus spp.) nominal 2 x 6 's (38 mm x 140 mm) from a single mill in Georgia (southeastern US) were evaluated for treatability with CCA preservative. After treatment, 128 pieces representing {{a broad range of}} treatment characteristics were selected and more fully evaluated for anatomical and chemical composition. No direct correlation was noted between CCA treatability and any of the anatomical characteristics evaluated in this study. Neither did a direct correlation between chemical composition and treatability seem to exist. The pit tori of all pits evaluated in this study were aspirated against the pit wall for this difficult to treat Southern pine lumber. This pit aspiration might have resulted from pre-treatment kiln drying. Later reductions in kiln temperature and increased kiln humidity (i. e., lowered <b>wet-bulb</b> <b>depression</b> temperature) reportedly resulted in improved treatability. In Phase 2, a methodology was developed to assess treatability after 3 treating schedules and then compare those results to permeability measurements and anatomical characteristics of matched material from 7 growth regions...|$|E
