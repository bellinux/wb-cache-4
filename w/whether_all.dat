Everything, According to Wikipedia is a 2010 American {{documentary}} film that explores {{the history and}} cultural implications of the online, user-editable encyclopedia Wikipedia.

In all, the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (OKL) deployed 1,035 aircraft from several Jagdgeschwader (JG — fighter wings) Kampfgeschwader (KG — bomber wings), Nachtjadggeschwader (NJG — night fighter wings) and Schlachtgeschwader (SG — ground attack wings); of these, 38.5% were Bf 109s, 38.5% Fw 190As, and 23% Fw 190Ds.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Pulos and Hutt's work, {{researchers}} were {{split on the}} mode of inheritance of white and whether it was deleterious (harmful). Recent research has discovered several possible genetic pathways to a white coat, so disparities in these historical findings may reflect the action of different genes. It {{is also possible that}} the varied origins of Pulos and Hutt's white horses might be responsible for the lack of homozygotes. Therefore, it remains to be proven <b>whether</b> <b>all</b> equine dominant white mutations cause embryonic lethality in the homozygous state.|$|E

5|$|During the 1968 Democratic Convention, {{a motion}} {{had been passed}} to {{establish}} a commission to reform the Democratic Party nomination process. In 1969, McGovern was named chair of the Commission on Party Structure and Delegate Selection, {{also known as the}} McGovern–Fraser Commission; due to the influence of former McCarthy and Kennedy supporters on the staff, the commission significantly reduced the role of party officials and insiders in the nomination process, increased the role of caucuses and primaries, and mandated quotas for proportional black, female, and youth delegate representation. A somewhat unintended consequence of the commission's reforms was a massive {{increase in the number of}} presidential primaries; this became true for the Republican Party as well. The U.S.presidential nominating process has been different ever since, with scholars and politicians debating <b>whether</b> <b>all</b> the changes are for the better.|$|E
5|$|M-type (metal-rich) asteroids form about 10% of {{the total}} population; their spectra {{resemble}} that of iron-nickel. Some {{are believed to have}} formed from the metallic cores of differentiated progenitor bodies that were disrupted through collision. However, there are also some silicate compounds that can produce a similar appearance. For example, the large M-type asteroid 22 Kalliope {{does not appear to be}} primarily composed of metal. Within the asteroid belt, the number distribution of M-type asteroids peaks at a semi-major axis of about 2.7AU. It is not yet clear <b>whether</b> <b>all</b> M-types are compositionally similar, or whether it is a label for several varieties which do not fit neatly into the main C and S classes.|$|E
5|$|Recuerdos de Provincia (Recollections of a Provincial Past), 1850. In {{this second}} autobiography, Sarmiento {{displays}} a stronger effort to include familial links and ties to his past, {{in contrast to}} Mi defensa, choosing to relate himself to San Juan and his Argentine heritage. Sarmiento discusses growing up in rural Argentina with basic ideologies and simple livings. Recuerdos discusses his Similar to Facundo, Sarmiento uses previous dossiers filed against himself by enemies to assist in writing Recuerdos and therefore fabricating an autobiography based on these files and from his own memory. Sarmiento's persuasion in this book is substantial. The accounts, <b>whether</b> <b>all</b> true or false against him, {{are a source of}} information to write Recuerdos as he is then able to object and rectify into what he creates as a 'true account' of autobiography.|$|E

5|$|The Originals played 35 matches on tour, {{and their}} only loss was a 3–0 defeat to Wales in Cardiff. The match has {{entered into the}} {{folklore}} of both countries because of a controversy over <b>whether</b> <b>All</b> Black Bob Deans scored a try which would have earned his team a 3–3 draw. In contrast {{to the success of}} the Originals on the field, the team did antagonise some in the Home Nations' rugby establishment; both administrators and the press complained that the All Blacks did not play the game within the amateur and gentlemanly spirit promoted by the International Rugby Football Board. This complaint continued to dog New Zealand teams until the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability to}} study prehistoric art is {{dependent}} on surviving artifacts. Art created in mediums such as sand, bark, hides and textiles has not normally endured, while less-perishable materials, such as rock, stone, bone, ivory (and {{to a lesser extent}} wood), later pottery and metal, {{are more likely to be}} extant. <b>Whether</b> <b>all</b> these artifacts can be defined as works of art is contested between scholars. Alexander Marshack argued that the earliest, non-representational incisions on rock mark the beginnings of human art. More cautiously, Paul Mellars suggests that the relative rarity of these works means they cannot be seen as integral to early human society and evidence of an artistic culture.|$|E
5|$|The spines of cacti {{are often}} useful in identification, since they vary greatly between species in number, color, size, shape and hardness, {{as well as}} in <b>whether</b> <b>all</b> the spines {{produced}} by an areole are similar or whether they are of distinct kinds. Most spines are straight or at most slightly curved, and are described as hair-like, bristle-like, needle-like or awl-like, depending on their length and thickness. Some cacti have flattened spines (e.g. Schlerocactus papyracanthus). Other cacti have hooked spines. Sometimes, one or more central spines are hooked, while outer spines are straight (e.g., Mammillaria rekoi).|$|E

5|$|The walrus is a mammal in {{the order}} Carnivora. It is the sole {{surviving}} {{member of the family}} Odobenidae, one of three lineages in the suborder Pinnipedia along with true seals (Phocidae) and eared seals (Otariidae). While there has been some debate as to <b>whether</b> <b>all</b> three lineages are monophyletic, i.e. descended from a single ancestor, or diphyletic, recent genetic evidence suggests all three descended from a caniform ancestor most closely related to modern bears. Recent multigene analysis indicates the odobenids and otariids diverged from the phocids about 20–26 million years ago, while the odobenids and the otariids separated 15–20 million years ago. Odobenidae was once a highly diverse and widespread family, including at least twenty species in the subfamilies Imagotariinae, Dusignathinae and Odobeninae. The key distinguishing feature was the development of a squirt/suction feeding mechanism; tusks are a later feature specific to Odobeninae, of which the modern walrus is the last remaining (relict) species.|$|E
5|$|Henry B. Payne (November 30, 1810September 9, 1896) was an American {{politician}} from Ohio. Moving to Ohio {{from his}} native New York in 1833, he quickly established himself in law and business while becoming a local leader in Democratic politics. After serving in the Ohio Senate, Payne was elected to a single term in the United States House of Representatives in 1874. In the House, he worked unsuccessfully for a compromise {{in the debate over}} <b>whether</b> <b>all</b> of the nation's currency should be backed by gold. He was defeated for reelection, but served on the Electoral Commission that convened in early 1877 to resolve the dispute over the results of the 1876 presidential election. He ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1880, but lost to Winfield Scott Hancock, who would go on to lose the general election to James A. Garfield. He was elected to the United States Senate in 1884. His election by the Ohio legislature was tainted with charges of bribery, but after investigation by the Senate, Payne was permitted to keep his seat. In the Senate, he voted for moderate tariff reforms and against the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, but was otherwise a reliable Democratic vote. He did not run for reelection, and died in 1896.|$|E
