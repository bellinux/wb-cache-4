500|$|... "Get Sexy" [...] {{features}} an interpolation of Right Said Fred's song [...] "I'm Too Sexy", which was composed by Christopher Fairbrass, Richard Fairbrass, and Robert Manzoli. It samples the trademark lyric, [...] "I'm too sexy for my shirt, too sexy for my shirt, so sexy it hurts", but replaces [...] "for my shirt" [...] with [...] "in this club". According to Digital Spy, {{in an interview}} with Teletext, Buchanan revealed that inspiration for the song came [...] "by accident", saying: [...] "The producers were messing around going, 'I'm too sexy for the studio'. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>like,</b> 'That sounds cool', and [...] said, 'You remember that Right Said Fred song?' <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>like,</b> 'Do you think we can do it?' By accident it came together." [...] Balls and Levine compared the song to [...] "Boom Boom Pow" [...] by Black Eyed Peas.|$|E
500|$|Radiohead {{had created}} Kid A and Amnesiac, {{recorded}} simultaneously, through a years-long process of recording and editing that drummer Phil Selway described as [...] "manufacturing {{music in the}} studio". For their next album, the band sought to capture a more immediate, [...] "live" [...] sound. Yorke told MTV: [...] "The last two studio records were a real headache. We had {{spent so much time}} looking at computers and grids, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>like,</b> that's enough, we can't do that any more. This time, we used computers, but they had to actually be in the room with all the gear. So everything was about performance, like staging a play." ...|$|E

And {{literally}} we came out the door and it was like just hundreds of people sort of coming around us. People everywhere, cameras, people yelling her name. It was incredible, I have never experienced anything like that. It was really reportage, loose, not planned, we went with feeling, we went with instinct... It's a beautiful cycle of energy." ...|$|E

And if the earlier generations <b>are</b> <b>like</b> people, then <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>like</b> donkeys."

500|$|... "Kiss You" [...] {{was chosen}} as the second US single and third {{international}} from their second studio album, Take Me Home. Liam Payne, a group member, in a November 2012 interview with MTV News, explained why they chose [...] "Kiss You" [...] as the album's second single in the US. Payne was quoted as saying: [...] "With the album, that's the first one that we listened to and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>like,</b> 'Yeah, we love this song'". According to a MTV News article, the number was released digitally in the United States on 17 November 2012. By 18 January 2013, the song had not been officially promoted to US radio stations. The track, however, was released by Sony Music Entertainment on 8 February 2013, as the record's second single in Germany.|$|E
500|$|Parker said {{following}} the tremendous success of [...] "Mr Hankey, the Christmas Poo", {{much of the}} direct feedback he received for [...] "Damien" [...] was negative. Parker described it as the [...] "first sort of backlash" [...] he had experienced with South Park, with fans claiming the show was losing its edge and that Parker and Stone had [...] "sold out". Parker said, [...] "We kept hearing that word so much. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>like,</b> 'What does that mean, sold out? What did we get and what did we do?' We just kept doing {{what we thought was}} funny, we didn't go start making commercials or anything. But everybody was saying we sold out." [...] Nevertheless, the episode received generally positive reviews, and has been described as one of South Park [...] "classic episodes".|$|E
500|$|Wednesday 13 {{explained}} the album's inspiration in an interview: [...] "Wednesday 13 (the band) has a live DVD that I put {{out and we}} couldn't think of a title and we were driving down the road thinking, {{we are going to}} have to come up with a name for it. The live titles, you have to put something like that. So, we were watching Bill O'Reilly and we kept listening to him say, 'Fuck it, we'll do it live.' That's kind of how quick we threw that DVD together. We didn't know we were putting it together like 4 days before so <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>like,</b> 'fuck it, we'll do it live.' We didn't do any overdubs on it, everybody in the band was sick and we just went with it." ...|$|E

500|$|Kevin Reed, {{a friend}} of the band, set up the drums and {{lighting}} when touring with the band. Reed's father, Lawrence R. Reed drew the Minotaur with a sword on the album's cover. Araya's younger brother, Johnny Araya, who was thirteen or fourteen at the time, was a roadie who set up the back line and sound. The band hardly made enough money to sustain themselves, only buying the [...] "essentials" [...] such as food, gas, and beer. Araya asserts, [...] "We basically used whatever money we got to get from point A to point B. When we got back, Brian was like, 'So, where's the money?' And <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>like,</b> 'What money?' At that time, we didn't realize that you had to ask for money up front. I think he got a lot of money sent directly to him, and we were supposed to pick up the rest." ...|$|E
500|$|Screenwriter John August {{identified}} with Will's character and adapted it after himself. In college, August's father died, and like Will, August {{had attempted to}} get to know him before his death, but found it difficult. Like Will, August had studied journalism and was 28 years old. In the film, Will says of Edward, [...] "I didn't see anything of myself in my father, and I don't think he saw anything of himself in me. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>like</b> strangers who knew each other very well." [...] Will's description of his relationship with Edward closely resembled August's own relationship with his father. Burton also used the film to confront his thoughts and emotions concerning {{the death of his father}} in 2000: [...] "My father had been ill for a while... I tried to get in touch with him, to have, like in this film, some sort of resolution, but it was impossible." ...|$|E
500|$|We {{explained}} to him what the song was about and he said, [...] "So, breaking out ... what about a boarding school?"

[...] and we all brainstormed from there [...] We really had to push. A lot [...] We {{had a lot of}} control over making the music on this record and we wrote [...] "Hook Me Up" [...] so we would have the best idea of what the video would be. So it was [...] "Use our ideas. They're free" [...] Because the song is so different from the first record, we wanted to make a video that was young and fun that kids could relate to. The video idea that was first proposed really was not for a young market. It was a lot older.|$|E

500|$|The lyrics {{were written}} with Hoppus and DeLonge going into {{separate}} rooms—Hoppus writing the choruses and DeLonge writing the verses. The two {{had not spoken}} {{to each other about}} the lyrics ahead of time, {{and it turned out that}} the two had both written about sex. When put together, the song represents the lustful side of sex during the verses, the passionate side in the bridge and the romantic side in the chorus, creating a juxtaposition between both voices. It has been interpreted as a description for failed romance, one that [...] "illustrates a scenario of lust, ambivalence and regret." [...] For Barker, the song's drum track was [...] "super in respect to John Bonham. [...] We were kind of messing around with the verse. It’s like, 'Well, I want to do a four-bar drum intro and just see how it works for the song.' And we never second-guessed it. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>like,</b> 'That sounds rad.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Variety {{discussed}} a possible sequel, saying {{it could happen}} if Speed Racer had a good box office performance. In 2008, a possible sequel was contemplated by the Wachowskis when Rain asked them why his character is so happy for Speed winning, and they replied it could be explained in the next film. Rain said he was hired for 3 years, while noting that doesn't guarantee a sequel will be released. Christina Ricci also considered it a possibility; she stated [...] "When we [...] were all leaving, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>like</b> 'write the sequel!' 'We want to come back'. And they [...] were like, 'I know. I know. We're going to. Don't worry'.", adding she would like more action scenes to her character. The producer Joel Silver said that the Wachowskis [...] "have a great story idea for a sequel" [...] {{but that it is}} [...] "a great idea for a sequel if it makes sense to make it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} not {{finished}} until {{the night before}} mastering. Chater had a flight to New York City at 7:30 in the morning. Di Blasi stated, [...] "so we’re in the studio till 6:30 that morning till he literally was like ‘I gotta go man, I gotta hop on the plane.’ <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>like,</b> ‘we think it sounds good. Fuck it.’" [...] Many tracks the Avalanches considered for Wildflower {{did not make it}} into the album because they did not contribute to its overall style. Collaborators on these songs included Jens Lekman, Connan Mockasin, [...] August Darnell, and Luke Steele. Once the style was more defined, they picked from tracks they had worked on which fell in line with others, similar to making a mix tape. The group intends to release these recordings that were closely related to Wildflower [...] "within a year or so" [...] of the album's release. This will help them [...] "clean the slate" [...] for new music to be made.|$|E

500|$|However, RCA Records, {{their former}} label who {{released}} Hello Master outside their native Canada {{in all other}} territories starting in 2006, became hopeful that the band's next record would have similar success. As a result, the label continually rejected the material represented by the demo recordings the group were sending in, believing {{that none of the}} songs could perform as commercially-successful singles. RCA continually delayed the band from entering the studio in hopes that they could write such a song, {{but by the time the}} group had written 20 songs (including material that was eventually phased out of their concert setlist) the label still had no confidence in the new material. [...] "We really were in an amazing place, writing, jamming four to five times a week and coming up with great stuff," [...] recalled Heppner. [...] "We felt at the peak of our creativity. [...] And they were like, 'Can you write more songs?' (<b>We</b> <b>were,</b> <b>like),</b> 'This is insane.'" [...] RCA would continue to differ with Priestess on the issue, even after the album was finished.|$|E
500|$|After a hiatus, Partridge {{returned}} in 2010 {{in a series}} of YouTube shorts, Mid Morning Matters with Alan Partridge, as the host of a digital radio show with co-presenter Sidekick Simon (Tim Key). Coogan co-wrote the shorts with brothers Neil and Rob Gibbons, who submitted scripts to his company Baby Cow Productions; the Gibbons have co-written every Partridge project since. According to Neil, Coogan [...] "invited us in, our sensibilities chimed, and before we knew it, Mid Morning Matters was up and running. We wrote it as if it was our baby, and though {{there was a sense that}} we were standing on the shoulders of giants, I think <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>like</b> two pairs of fresh eyes, and Steve seemed to fall in love with the character all over again." [...] Coogan said they chose the web format because [...] "it was a bit underground, a low-key environment in which to test the character out again. And the response was so good, we realised there was more fuel in the tank." [...] The shorts were later broadcast by Sky Atlantic.|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{the release}} of the album, a few tracks were made {{available}} for streaming via the band's Myspace: [...] "The Plot to Bomb the Panhandle", [...] "Fast Forward to 2012", [...] "The Danger in Starting a Fire", [...] "A Shot in the Dark" [...] and [...] "Show 'Em the Ropes". Cover art was unveiled on November 30, 2006. A commercial to promote the album was released on January 4, 2007. Pre-orders were taken starting January 16. The album was released in the US on January 22, while the UK release occurred a week later, on January 29. On March 8, the band released the music video for [...] "The Plot to Bomb the Panhandle", which featured Ron Jeremy. The video was filmed in Los Angeles. After being asked how they got Jeremy to appear, McKinnon said [...] "It was pretty much some that we were kicking around. We were kicking around different people and I think, Tony threw that out there, out of nowhere and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>like</b> 'That'd be cool, that'd be funny, people will be into that.'".|$|E

Bennington commented on the collaborations, stating that [...] "We really felt like {{if we need to}} be inspired and move in another direction. I think when we got Page in, Mike had written this chorus and sang it, and his voice had this tone, and it was unlike anything I'd heard from him before. And I was like, [...] "Dude this is crazy, this sounds like a Helmet song! It's cool!" [...] And <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>like,</b> [...] "Dude, why don't we {{see if we can get}} like Page in here?"

[...] Rubano called the opening guitar riff [...] "not quite 'Paradise City', but it's a guitar riff where when we first came up with it, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>like,</b> 'Whoa! Rock! He thought that [...] "Liar (It Takes One to Know One)" [...] sounded like a modern equivalent of the Police. Lazzara called the song [...] "110 miles-per-hour, very hard to play and totally rocking," [...] and Mascherino considered it and [...] "Spin" [...] the group's fastest songs ever. [...] "MakeDamnSure" [...] has a phone message in the bridge; Lazzara and his girlfriend were arguing at the time, and she left him a message. Lazzara showed it to Valentine, wanting to include it in the song. He called [...] "My Blue Heaven" [...] "laid-back."

500|$|In 1723, {{his first}} year in Leipzig, Bach had {{composed}} no new cantata for Christmas Day, but revived Christen, ätzet diesen Tag, BWV 63, on a text of free poetry without any biblical or chorale content. That year, he composed new works for the second and third feast day. In 1724, his second year, he composed three chorale cantatas for the three feast days, beginning with Gelobet seist du, Jesu Christ, BWV 91. In his third year, Bach used a cantata text by Georg Christian Lehms, which was published already in 1711 in Darmstadt in the collection Gottgefälliges Kirchen-Opffer. The librettist began with a quotation of two verses from Psalm 126 which deals with the hope for delivery of Jerusalem, [...] "When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>like</b> them that dream.", and the joyful reaction (...) [...] The poet included for a recitative a verse from the Book of Jeremiah, praising God's greatness (...) , and he quoted from the Christmas story in the Gospel of Luke the singing of the angels (...) [...] In this early text, three biblical quotations alternate with arias. The closing chorale is the fifth stanza of Caspar Füger's hymn [...] "Wir Christenleut".|$|E
