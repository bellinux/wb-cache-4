5|$|The Georgian {{government}} {{launched an}} initiative to curb smuggling from South Ossetia in 2004 after its success in restoring control in Adjara.

5|$|The {{collectivization}} {{efforts in}} the 1930s led to the concentration of the reindeer herds in kolkhozes (collective farms), which, in turn, <b>were</b> <b>further</b> consolidated into a few large-scale state farms in the late 1950s–early 1970s. By the mid-1970s, the state farms <b>were</b> <b>further</b> consolidated into just two, based in Lovozero and Krasnoshchelye. The consolidations were rationalized by the necessity to isolate the herders from the military installations, {{as well as by}} the need to flood some territories to construct hydroelectric plants.|$|E
5|$|The {{country was}} first divided into several {{administrative}} units during the Anuradhapura Kingdom. The kingdom {{was divided into}} three provinces; Rajarata, Ruhuna and Malaya Rata. These <b>were</b> <b>further</b> subdivided into smaller units called rata. Over time, the number of provinces increased, but the second-level administrative division continued to be the rata. However, with the country eventually being divided into more than one kingdom and with foreign colonial missions landing and taking {{parts of the country}} under their control, this structure began to change. The territory of the Kotte Kingdom was organized into four disavas, which <b>were</b> <b>further</b> subdivided into forty korales. The korales had their own civil and military officials with a small militia. The Jaffna kingdom appears to have had a similar administrative structure to this with four provinces.|$|E

5|$|Alexander was erudite and patronized both {{arts and}} sciences. However, {{he had little}} {{interest}} in sports or the Olympic games (unlike his father), seeking only the Homeric ideals of honour (timê) and glory (kudos). He had great charisma and force of personality, characteristics which made him a great leader. His unique abilities <b>were</b> <b>further</b> demonstrated by the inability of any of his generals to unite Macedonia and retain the Empire after his death—only Alexander had the ability to do so.|$|E
5|$|All the {{proposals}} were {{reviewed by the}} Welsh Office, who rejected sites due to poor location, accommodation or cost.

5|$|Arnold {{was not in}} a {{position}} to influence what transpired at Fort Griswold, as he remained in New London and observed the action at Fort Griswold across the river. He was blamed by many on both sides for the affair, however, because he was the commanding officer who bore full responsibility for the actions of his men. American sentiments <b>were</b> <b>further</b> inflamed against him for the simple fact that he had betrayed and killed those among whom he had grown up.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 13th century, a {{primitive}} form of milling the silk threads was already in use. In 1221 Jean de Garlande's dictionary, and in 1226, Étienne Boileau's Livre des métiers (Tradesman's Handbook) enumerated many types of devices which can only have been doubling machines. The instruments used <b>were</b> <b>further</b> perfected in Bologna between 1270 and 1280.

5|$|Brighton's origins {{lie in the}} Saxon {{fishing and}} {{agricultural}} village of Bristelmestune. The English Channel formed its southern limit, but on all other sides was farmland divided into open fields called laines. These <b>were</b> <b>further</b> subdivided into furlongs—wide parallel strips—and paul-pieces, which were much narrower strips. Despite their small size, neighbouring paul-pieces often had different owners. Wide paths (leakways) ran at right-angles to the furlongs, separating them. This ancient land-use pattern, which survived until the 18th century despite its unsuitability for contemporary farming methods, significantly influenced the pattern of urban development in 18th- and 19th-century Brighton.|$|E

However, during times of great conflict and crisis, the raising of large militias required the appointment of many new officers with various titles, which were often bestowed as honorary titles to officials during times of peace. Large divisions were led by a General (Jiangjun 將軍) whose rank depended on status; divisions were divided {{into a number of}} regiments commanded by a Colonel, and sometimes by a Major. Regiments were divided into companies and led by Captains, who ranked Equivalent to 2,000-dan, while companies <b>were</b> <b>further</b> divided into platoons.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} decade, CMB anisotropies <b>were</b> <b>further</b> investigated {{by a large}} number of ground-based and balloon experiments.

5|$|Effective in the 2014 racing season, the {{grandstand}} capacity was reduced from 92,000 to 68,000.
