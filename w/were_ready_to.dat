However a chief of {{exceptional}} cunning realized that the Humans, although out-numbered, had prevailed {{through the use of}} superior tactics, organization, and by magic. He united the clans, imposed discipline on their army and sought new magics from the Warlocks and Necromancers. Their combined forces <b>were</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> overthrow the Humans.|$|E

5|$|The Slatina crisis reverberated in {{the capital}} and posed {{problems}} for the Conservative cabinet of Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino. Reportedly, both the Minister of Agriculture Nicolae Fleva and the Minister of Justice Dissescu <b>were</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> hand in their resignations. Bogdan-Pitești himself was arrested for sedition, but soon after checked himself into Filantropia Hospital. He averted sentencing when the prosecutors were unable to conclusively prove this involvement.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} conclusions {{were still}} being debated by academics and conspiracy theorists more than 50 years after the assassination.

5|$|Confronted by an openly hostile Byzantine Empire, {{and faced}} with the eventuality that the war with the Lombards would be renewed at the truce's expiration, Thurisind searched for new allies {{as a way to}} {{pressure}} Justinian. He found assistance from the Kutrigurs, who he ferried across the Danube into the Byzantine Illyricum in 550 or 551, before the truce expired and probably before the Gepids <b>were</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> precipitate a new conflict. In retrospect, it may be they arrived too late instead of too early, if the agreement had been made with the Second Lombard–Gepid War in mind.|$|E
5|$|Cook {{then sent}} {{the game to}} Broderbund for testing, which took two weeks. He {{resolved}} three small errors and other minor, proposed changes before submitting the final version. By this point, the company had printed the game's packaging—boxes, labels, and documentation—such that they <b>were</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> ship after receiving the approval from game testers. The game debuted at the June 1983 Consumer Electronics Show and was later released on diskette for the Apple II, Atari 8-bit family, and Commodore 64.|$|E
5|$|Evidently {{the great}} mass of laboring men failed to {{comprehend}} the situation. Too much then, as now, capital was their enemy, not their friend. Too much then, as now, in their way of thinking, there was no limit {{to the ability of}} capital. They did not see that capital could not pay wages, buy raw material and manufacture goods unless it could sell its products and get returns. And if a few more intelligent did see these things the pressure of hungry wives and children obscured all reason and they <b>were</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> go along on anything that offered a shadow of relief.|$|E

5|$|Following {{a string}} of {{successful}} adventure games, LucasArts assigned Dave Grossman and Tim Schafer to lead {{development of a new}} game. The two had previously assisted Ron Gilbert with the creation of The Secret of Monkey Island and , and the studio felt that Grossman and Schafer <b>were</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> manage a project. The company believed that the pair's humor matched well with that of Maniac Mansion and suggested working on a sequel. The two developers agreed and commenced production. Gilbert and Gary Winnick, the creators of Maniac Mansion, collaborated with Grossman and Schafer on the initial planning and writing. The total budget for the game was about $600,000, according to Schafer.|$|E
5|$|In early 1988, Butthole Surfers <b>were</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> {{record a}} new album and wanted to use a modern studio for the first time, {{choosing}} a state-of-the-art facility in Texas. The following sessions took only one week, as the band had been performing most of the material for years. The band opted to follow this album's blueprint on future projects. In contrast, songs on their earlier recordings had undergone far more in-studio development and experimentation. Pinkus has expressed the opinion that the later, better-organized sessions stifled much of the spontaneous creativity that had propelled their earlier releases.|$|E

5|$|Slowed by knee injuries, Motley {{left the}} Browns after the 1953 season. He {{attempted}} a comeback in 1955 as a linebacker for the Pittsburgh Steelers but was released {{before the end}} of the year. He then pursued a coaching career, but was turned away by the Browns and other teams he approached. He attributed his trouble finding a job in football to racial discrimination, questioning whether teams <b>were</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> hire a black coach. Motley was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1968.|$|E
5|$|The French {{responded by}} attacking and {{capturing}} Washington at Fort Necessity in July 1754. They {{allowed him to}} return with his troops to Virginia. Historian Joseph Ellis concludes that the episode demonstrated Washington's bravery, initiative, inexperience, and impetuosity. Upon his return to Virginia, Washington refused to accept a demotion {{to the rank of}} captain, and resigned his commission. Washington's expedition into the Ohio Country had international consequences; the French accused Washington of assassinating Jumonville, who they claimed was on a diplomatic mission. Both France and Great Britain <b>were</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> fight for control of the region and both sent troops to North America in 1755; war was formally declared in 1756.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{reference to}} a garden at Little Moreton Hall comes from an early 17th-century set of household accounts referring to a gardener and the purchase of some seeds. Philip Moreton, who ran the estate for his older brother Edward in the mid-17th century, left {{a considerable amount of}} information on the layout and planting of the area of garden within the moat, {{to the west of the}} house. He writes of a herb garden, vegetable garden, and a nursery for maturing fruit trees until they <b>were</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> be transferred to the orchard at the south and east of the house, probably where the orchard is today.|$|E

5|$|The {{end result}} of the air {{campaign}} against Britain in 1940 and 1941 was a decisive failure to end the war. As Hitler committed Germany to ever increasing military adventures, the Wehrmacht became increasingly overstretched {{and was unable to}} cope with a multi-front war. By 1944, the Allies <b>were</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> launch Operation Overlord, the invasion of Western Europe. The Battle of Britain ensured that the Western Allies had a base from which to launch the campaign and {{that there would be a}} Western Allied presence on the battlefield to meet the Soviet Red Army in central Europe at the end of the war in May 1945.|$|E
5|$|To begin with, {{the number}} of the party members is {{extremely}} large. Millions of people believed in the National Socialist philosophy; they were influenced by the broadcasts of the Führer and the detailed party propaganda. Individual thinking was switched off, and the party members allowed their leaders to set the guidelines in everything for them--and this spread throughout the entire population. In this way, more fanatics were created who <b>were</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> use brute force, and other means of terror, to eliminate any internal resistance.|$|E
