5|$|Frank Oz said The Land of Gorch {{experiment}} had its positives and negatives. Oz said {{he thought}} the routine was not a good fit for Saturday Night Live, and that the cartoon-style humor of their characters did not <b>work</b> <b>well</b> <b>with</b> the comedy of Saturday Night Live, much of which was initially derived from the Second City environment. Oz said he generally enjoyed working on Saturday Night Live and witnessing the skill of performers such as Andy Kaufman, Albert Brooks, John Belushi, Chevy Chase, and Dan Aykroyd.|$|E
5|$|Hans von Halban {{had proved}} to be an unfortunate choice as he was a poor administrator, and did not <b>work</b> <b>well</b> <b>with</b> Mackenzie or the NRC. The Americans saw him as a {{security}} risk, and objected to the French atomic patents claimed by the Paris Group (in association with ICI). In April 1944 a Combined Policy Committee meeting at Washington agreed that Canada would build a heavy water reactor. Scientists who were not British subjects would leave, and Cockcroft became the new director of the Montreal Laboratory in May 1944. E. W. R. Steacie became assistant director and head of the Chemistry division when Paneth left. Volkoff eventually succeeded Placzek as head of the Theoretical Physics division. Halban remained as head of the nuclear physics division.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Ross {{had signed}} Georges Boucher as coach, but Boucher did not <b>work</b> <b>well</b> <b>with</b> Ross and team {{president}} Weston Adams. Looking {{to hire a}} new coach {{in the summer of}} 1950, Ross phoned Lynn Patrick, the son of Lester, who had just resigned from the New York Rangers after coaching the team to the Stanley Cup Final. Lynn had moved his family back to Victoria, British Columbia, where he grew up as a child, with the intention of coaching the Victoria Cougars, a team in the minor professional Pacific Coast Hockey League. Though reluctant to move back to the eastern United States, Lynn was hired by Ross after he was offered a salary of $12,000. He would coach the team for the next four seasons and become the second general manager of the Bruins when Ross retired at the end of October 1954.|$|E

5|$|In August 1943, the Quebec Agreement subsumed the British Tube Alloys project {{into the}} Manhattan Project, and {{established}} the Combined Policy Committee {{to control the}} Manhattan Project. A final agreement was spelt out on 20 May 1944. Under it, the Americans would assist {{with the construction of}} a heavy water-moderated nuclear reactor in Canada, and would provide technical assistance with matters such as corrosion and the effects of radiation on materials. They would not provide details about plutonium chemistry or metallurgy, although irradiated uranium slugs were made available for the British to work it out for themselves. A sticking point was the director of the Montreal Laboratory, Hans von Halban, who was a poor administrator, did not <b>work</b> <b>well</b> <b>with</b> the Canadians, and was regarded as a security risk by the Americans. In April 1944 a Combined Policy Committee meeting at Washington agreed that Montreal Laboratory scientists who were not British subjects would leave, and Cockcroft would become the new director of the Montreal Laboratory in May 1944.|$|E
5|$|Independent twin sets or {{independent}} doubles {{consists of two}} independent cylinders and two regulators, each with a submersible pressure gauge. This system is heavier, more expensive to buy and maintain and more expensive to fill than a single cylinder set. The diver must swap demand valves during the dive to preserve a sufficient reserve of gas in each cylinder. If this is not done, then if a cylinder should fail the diver may end up having an inadequate reserve. Independent twin sets do not <b>work</b> <b>well</b> <b>with</b> air-integrated computers as they usually only monitor one cylinder. The complexity of switching regulators periodically to ensure both cylinders are evenly used may be offset by the redundancy of two entirely separate breathing gas supplies. The cylinders may be mounted as a twin set on the diver's back, or alternatively can be carried in a sidemount configuration where penetration of wrecks or caves requires it, and where the cylinder valves are in easy reach.|$|E
5|$|With Stivetts now established, Clarkson became {{expendable}} and {{was released}} from the team on June30, leaving Boston with a solid three-man pitching rotation {{for the remainder of the}} season. On August6, 1892, Stivetts pitched a no-hitter against the Brooklyn Bridegrooms, an 11–0victory. Later, on September5, he started, completed, and defeated Louisville in both games of a doubleheader. The following day, the press credited the victories to his ability to <b>work</b> <b>well</b> <b>with</b> runners on the bases. The regular season for the Beaneaters closed on October15 with a doubleheader against the Washington Senators. Stivetts pitched the second game, and delivered a complete game shutout, his third shutout of the season, and his 35th victory. Although he finished within the top-ten in several pitching statistical categories, his strikeout total dropped to 180in 1892. His 3.9strikeouts per 9innings pitched(K/9) was significantly lower from the 5.3the previous season.|$|E

25|$|Carginan's {{tendency}} to produce short shoots with clusters that grow {{closely to the}} trunk of the vine means that it is difficult variety to harvest mechanically.
