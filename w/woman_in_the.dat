5|$|Myrrha {{has been}} {{interpreted}} as developing from a girl into a <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> course of the story: in the beginning she is a virgin refusing her suitors, in that way denying the part of herself that is normally dedicated to Aphrodite. The goddess then strikes her with desire to make love with her father and Myrrha is then made into a <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> grip of an uncontrollable lust. The marriage between her father and mother is then set as an obstacle for her love along with incest being forbidden by the laws, profane as well as divine. The way the daughter seduces her father illustrates the most extreme version a seduction can take: the union between two persons who by social norms and laws are strictly held apart.|$|E

40|$|Democracy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{contemporary}} and modern world is inconceivable without the active and equal participation of <b>women</b> <b>in</b> all fields of social life, {{especially at the}} management level. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate to what extent, and if at all, the transition path to modern democracy was accompanied by adequate political participation of <b>women</b> <b>in</b> management positions and the executive branch. The question is whether <b>the</b> proportion of <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Croatian Government <b>in</b> <b>the</b> period 1990 - 2016 recorded an increase in relation to men? Since Croatia had a similar political path to declaring its independence like the neighbouring Republic of Slovenia, a comparison was made regarding <b>the</b> proportion of <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Croatian Government as opposed to the neighbouring Slovenia. To further argue the data obtained from quantitative research, <b>the</b> share of <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> governments of Croatia and Slovenia was compared with the current average share of <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> governments of 28 EU member states. The first part describes how <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world got the right to vote and the development of women’s rights in Croatia. A total of 13 Croatian Governments were analysed with an emphasis on <b>the</b> proportion of <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> executive branch, as well as areas of political interest to <b>women</b> <b>in</b> government. <b>The</b> proportion of <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same period <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Government of the Republic of Slovenia was also analysed, and a comparison was made with <b>the</b> share of <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Croatian Government. Consequently, an attempt was made to compare the proportion of women with the average share of <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> governments of the 28 EU countries...|$|R
