50|$|In such {{conditions}} (on 2 and 17 June 1951 I managed {{to shoot down}} some Sabres. For example, reminded me the following combat: We flew in a zveno flight, a 4-airplanes formation in the area assigned to patrol, having performed some circuits, when <b>we</b> <b>spotted</b> a group of eight Sabres, heading in a head-on course. We maneuvered to gain altitude and turned around to attack them from the rear hemisphere, but the Sabres spotted us and turned around too. A quartet kept on flying straight, and I with a dive began to chase the aircraft of the rearmost quartet. Two Sabres went to left, and two to the right; Lazutin's pair attacked the pair on the left, and went towards the right. The Sabres began to dive, but by then the range had decreased, and at about 400 meters I open fire. I see hits all over the Sabre wingman, which releasing smoke kept on diving. My wingman jumped the second Sabre, but his aircraft began to shake, due to the speed had almost reached 1.000 km/h, and consequently missed. We {{got out of the}} dive, and we saw that below remained only one Sabre - no trace of the second. Soon the ground control confirmed us, that he fell.|$|E
5000|$|HAL's name, {{according}} to writer Arthur C. Clarke, {{is derived from}} Heuristically programmed ALgorithmic computer. After the film was released fans noticed HAL was a one-letter shift from the name IBM {{and there has been}} much speculation since that this was a dig at the large computer company, something that has been denied by both Clarke and 2001 director Stanley Kubrick. Clarke addressed the issue in his book The Lost Worlds of 2001: ...about once a week some character spots the fact that HAL is one letter ahead of IBM, and promptly assumes that Stanley and I were taking a crack at the estimable institution ... As it happened, IBM had given us a good deal of help, so we were quite embarrassed by this, and would have changed the name had <b>we</b> <b>spotted</b> the coincidence. IBM was consulted during the making of the film and their logo can be seen on props in the film including Pan Am Clipper's cockpit instrument panel and on the lower arm keypad on Poole's space suit. During production it was brought to IBM's attention that the film's plot included a homicidal computer but they approved association with the film if it was clear any [...] "equipment failure" [...] was not related to their products.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: About 20 % {{of women}} with ovarian can-cer have low {{concentrations}} of serum cancer antigen 125 (CA 125), and this important tumormarker cannot be used to monitor their disease. The measured con-centration for mucin 1 (MUC 1), or CA 15 - 3, another tumor marker, can be lowered in breast and ovarian cancer patients when circulating immune complexes (CICs) containing antibodies bound to the free antigen are present. Because CA 125 and MUC 1 are related members of the mucin family, we sought to determine whether CICs might also exist for CA 125 and interfere with its clinical assay. METHODS: We developed an antigen capture–based as-say to determine the presence of CICs for CA 125. <b>We</b> <b>spotted</b> mouse antibodies to CA 125 onto nanoparticl...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the sensitivity of}} real roots of polynomial systems with respect to perturbations of the coefficients. In particular - for {{a version of the}} condition number defined by Cucker, Krick, Malajovich, and Wschebor - we establish new probabilistic estimates that allow a much broader family of measures than considered earlier. We also generalize further by allowing over-determined systems. Along the way, we derive new Lipshitz estimates for polynomial maps from R^n to R^m, extending earlier work of Kellog on the case m= 1, which may be of independent interest. In Part II, we study smoothed complexity and how sparsity (in the sense of restricting which monomial terms can appear) can help further improve earlier condition number estimates.

40|$|International audienceBiologically {{templated}} electrodes for Li-ion {{batteries are}} proposed. However, many questions regarding their practicality {{and their use}} {{on a large scale}} remain. Herein we revisit the phage-assisted synthesis of Co 3 O 4 nanoparticles so as to identify the bio-chemistry/chemistry involved beyond this engineering phage synthetic approach and weigh its overall benefit. Various synthesis approaches to mimic the role of the phage which consist of using (i) wild or genetically modified phages made by insertions of specific peptides in the capsid protein, (ii) free peptides, and (iii) MWCNTs as the template were tried, and the resulting Co 3 O 4 nanoparticles were checked for their morphology, size, organization, and electrochemical performances. <b>We</b> <b>spotted</b> the importance of a tetra-peptide motif in the Co 3 O 4 nucleation/texturation process, whether this motif is part of the phage capsid or not, suggesting that the structure of the whole phage is not necessary for the production of the nanoparticles.

40|$|Obliterative bronchiolitis (OB) {{continues}} to be the major limitation to long-term survival after lung transplantation. The specific aetiology and pathogenesis of OB are not well understood. To explore the role of autoreactivity in OB, <b>we</b> <b>spotted</b> 751 different self molecules onto glass slides, and used these antigen microarrays to profile 48 human serum samples for immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM autoantibodies; 27 patients showed no or mild bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS; a clinical correlate of OB) and 15 patients showed medium to severe BOS. We now report that these BOS grades could be differentiated by a profile of autoantibodies binding to 28 proteins or their peptides. The informative autoantibody profile included down-regulation as well as up-regulation of both IgM and IgG specific reactivities. This profile was evaluated for robustness using a panel of six independent test patients. Analysis of the functions of the 28 informative self antigens showed that eight of them are connected in an interaction network involved in apoptosis and protein metabolism. Thus, a profile of autoantibodies may reflect pathological processes in the lung allograft, suggesting a role for autoimmunity in chronic rejection leading to OB...|$|E
