5|$|Gale married Henrietta Roper, the {{daughter}} of Henry Roper of Cowling, Kent. She died in 1720. They had one son, Roger Henry Gale, {{who was born in}} 1710. Gale himself died on 25 June 1744 at his estates in Scruton, and was buried near the church there. There is no monument in the churchyard, as he stipulated in his will that he be buried in such a manner that no one <b>would</b> <b>know</b> exactly where he was buried.|$|E
5|$|It {{is known}} McCudden proved remarkably good at {{stalking}} tactics, which {{enabled him to}} get up underneath an opponent, pull down the wing gun and fire up into the German machine. The first the recipients <b>would</b> <b>know</b> of the attack was bullets coming up through {{the bottom of the}} fuselage of the aircraft, often causing death or injury, holing petrol tanks and crippling engines. The gun, being fed by a drum of ammunition, could also be reloaded in its pulled-down position, the pilot having two or more spare drums located in his cockpit.|$|E
5|$|Parsons {{would become}} the first inmate to be {{executed}} in a new chamber that was built in 1998 at Utah State Prison for use in either firing squads or lethal injections. Two people, whose identities were withheld, were selected to administer individual injections, of which only one was lethal so that neither <b>would</b> <b>know</b> with certainty who executed the prisoner. The prison selected among paramedics or nurses because the American Medical Association prohibits licensed physicians from participating in executions. A mild sedative was delivered intravenously to calm Parsons before the deadly drugs were administered.|$|E

5|$|The Mahabharata corroborates the Ramayana account. Vishvavasu tells Rama to {{seek the}} help of Sugriva, who <b>would</b> <b>know</b> where Ravana stays. Kabandha also assured Rama that he would {{definitely}} meet Sita again. In the Mahavira-charita, the divine person that leaves the funeral pyre informs Rama that he is Danu and a curse had turned him in a demon, who was manipulated by Malyavan – Ravana's chief adviser – to create havoc in the region. He expresses his gratitude to Rama and cautions him that Malyavan has also set Vali against him.|$|E
5|$|The {{new point}} {{system for the}} general {{classification}} was met with some resistance as many people were very confused by how the new system operated or simply preferred the original system the organizers had used in years past. In response to the confusion surrounding the general classification format, the race organizers released a supplement to help better explain how the new points system operated. A La Stampa writer claimed that the supplement provided several lengthy example calculations and stated that they <b>would</b> <b>know</b> after the first stage how successful this new system will be.|$|E
5|$|There {{are those}} who will {{consider}} it their duty, as friends of the Negro people, to tell us to revile him, to flee, even from the presence of his memory, to save ourselves by writing {{him out of the}} history of our turbulent times. Many will ask what Harlem finds to honor in this stormy, controversial and bold young captainand we will smile. Many will say turn awayaway from this man, for he is not a man but a demon, a monster, a subverter and an enemy of the black manand we will smile. They will say that he is of hatea fanatic, a racistwho can only bring evil to the cause for which you struggle! And we will answer and say to them: Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you ever touch him, or have him smile at you? Did you ever really listen to him? Did he ever do a mean thing? Was he ever himself associated with violence or any public disturbance? For if you did you <b>would</b> <b>know</b> him. And if you knew him you <b>would</b> <b>know</b> why we must honor him... And, in honoring him, we honor the best in ourselves.|$|E

5|$|To use Lorenz, a {{conventional}} radio was {{tuned to the}} transmission, and the operator would listen for the signal and try {{to determine if they}} heard dots or dashes. If they heard dots, the short 0.2s pulse, they <b>would</b> <b>know</b> they were too far to the left, and turned to the right in order to reach the centreline. Dashes indicated they should turn left. In the centre the receiver could hear both signals, which merged to form a steady tone, the equisignal.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} later, Phoenix's {{reputation}} takes a hit when {{he fails to}} properly defend a former client, Maggey Byrde, against accusations that she poisoned a talented programmer, Glen Elg. Convinced that someone impersonated him, Phoenix secures a retrial and conducts his own investigation. He discovers that Elg was developing a computer virus on behalf of loan shark Furio Tigre, and that Tigre, needing money to repay a large debt, killed him to steal it, then arranged for Maggey to take the fall. With no conclusive evidence, Phoenix manages to get Tigre arrested by making him say something only the real killer <b>would</b> <b>know.</b>|$|E
5|$|For voice casting, the {{localization}} {{team was}} sent {{a list of}} people who might fit the roles, along with short reels for each actor. Once the actors had been chosen, Bateman wrote the voice direction, which consisted of short blurbs the voice actors saw next to the line they were supposed to say, so they <b>would</b> <b>know</b> how to perform it. While the North American version of the game allows the user to select either Japanese or English audio tracks, the European version, which was released by Rising Star Games, only features the Japanese audio track.|$|E

5|$|From 1994 to 1995 Tomlinson {{worked in}} the {{operational}} counter-proliferation department. His first posting in this capacity was to work as an undercover agent against Iran, where he succeeded in penetrating the Iranian Intelligence Service. He posed as a British businessman, and infiltrated a network of arms dealers that included Nahum Manbar. The British government supplied the Iranians with materials for chemical weapons {{in order to gain}} intelligence on Iran's military programme. Tomlinson's description of his Iranian activities are generally considered to be true, due to his personal involvement and knowledge of details that only an insider <b>would</b> <b>know.</b>|$|E
5|$|In chapter five Goldacre {{suggests}} {{using the}} General Practice Research Database in the UK, which contains the anonymized records of several million patients, to conduct randomized trials {{to determine the}} most effective of competing treatments. For example, to compare two statins, atorvastatin and simvastatin, doctors would randomly assign patients to one or the other. The patients would be followed up by having data about their cholesterol levels, heart attacks, strokes and deaths taken from their computerized medical records. The trials would not be blind– patients <b>would</b> <b>know</b> which statin they had been prescribed– but Goldacre writes {{that they would be}} unlikely to hold such firm beliefs about which one is preferable {{to the extent that it}} could affect their health.|$|E
5|$|Scott avoided using green screens unless necessary. Instead, he used various items so {{the actors}} <b>would</b> <b>know</b> {{where they should}} be looking in any {{particular}} scene on the practical sets where CGI elements would be inserted in post-production. Rapace said that green screens were used fewer than six times during filming. The production used five 3ality Technical Atom 3D rigs, four of which were configured with Red Epic 3D cameras set on camera dollies and tripods, which were continuously in use during filming. The fifth rig used an Epic camera as a steadicam, which was used only occasionally.|$|E

5|$|The Old Poor Law was {{a parish}} based system, there were around 15,000 such parishes {{based upon the}} area around a parish church. The system allowed for despotic {{behavior}} from the Overseers of the Poor but as Overseers of the Poor <b>would</b> <b>know</b> their paupers they were considered able to differentiate between the deserving and undeserving poor making the system both more humane and initially more efficient. The Elizabethan Poor Law operated {{at a time when}} the population was small enough for everyone to know everyone else, therefore people's circumstances would be known and the idle poor would be unable to claim on the parishes' poor rate. The system provided social stability yet by 1750 needed to be adapted to cope with population increases, greater mobility and regional price variations.|$|E
5|$|The {{lyrics of}} The Power of Four were {{circulated}} {{to all of}} the members of the British and Irish Lions tour squad and the song was pre-added to the playlists on their tour iPods. The song was not released as a single however it was permitted to be broadcast by radio stations and it was made available to download on the Internet. The British and Irish Lions players were shown the words of The Power of Four on the Saturday before their first game and it was expected that they <b>would</b> <b>know</b> the words by the time they had arrived in New Zealand. However it was mentioned by a British and Irish Lions spokesman that the players were under no obligation to sing it.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the old {{characters}} in the Pokémon franchise, Mew's development was not overseen by Ken Sugimori, but by Game Freak programmer Shigeki Morimoto. Morimoto programmed Mew into the game secretly, as a prank amongst the staff just prior to its release in Japan, intending {{it to be a}} Pokémon only Game Freak staff members <b>would</b> <b>know</b> about and be able to obtain. Mew was added {{at the very end of}} the development of Pokémon Red and Blue after the removal of debug features, freeing up just enough space to add the character despite being told not to alter the game any further at this point. Though not intended by the developers to be obtainable, due to a glitch, players were able to encounter it.|$|E

5|$|At about 9:20am on Saturday 15 June 1996, the Ford van {{was parked}} on Corporation Street, outside the Marks & Spencer store, near the Arndale Centre. After setting the bomb's timer, two men – wearing hooded jackets, {{baseball}} caps and sunglasses – left {{the vehicle and}} walked to Cathedral Street, where a third man picked {{them up in the}} Ford Granada. The truck had been parked on double yellow lines with its hazard lights flashing. Within three minutes a traffic warden had issued the vehicle with a parking ticket and called for its removal. At about 9:40am, Granada Studios on Quay Street received a telephone call claiming that there was a bomb at the corner of Corporation Street and Cannon Street and that it would explode in one hour. The caller had an Irish accent and gave an IRA codeword so that police <b>would</b> <b>know</b> the threat was genuine. Four other telephoned warnings were sent to television/radio stations, newspapers and a hospital.|$|E
5|$|Hick used Irenaeus' {{notion of}} {{two-stage}} creation {{and supported the}} belief that the second stage, being created into the likeness of God, is still in progress. He argued that to be created in the image of God means to have the potential for knowledge of and a relationship with God; this is fulfilled when creation in the likeness of God is complete. Humanity currently exists in the image of God and is being developed into spiritual maturity. Hick proposed that human morality is developed through the experience of evil and argued that it is possible for humans to know God, but only if they choose to out of their own free will. Hick acknowledges that some suffering seems to serve no constructive purpose and instead just damages the individual. Hick justifies this by appealing to the concept of mystery. He argues that, if suffering was always beneficial to humans, it would be impossible for humans to develop compassion or sympathy because we <b>would</b> <b>know</b> that someone who is suffering will certainly benefit from it. However, if {{there is an element of}} mystery to suffering, to the effect that some people suffer without benefit, it allows feelings of compassion and sympathy to emerge.|$|E
5|$|If tanks or a {{large number}} of troops were seen passing, they would radio the LRDG {{headquarters}} at Siwa immediately so that by the time the enemy reached the front line, GHQ at Cairo <b>would</b> <b>know</b> they were coming. Once a patrol was relieved they would transmit details of all they had seen back to Siwa. The LRDG did not lose any men or vehicles when on the road watch, but they did have some close encounters. On 21 March 'R1' Patrol was surrounded by a convoy of 27 vehicles and about 200 men who stopped for the night between the watchers and their vehicles. While the road watch was ongoing, other patrols would be attacking targets along other stretches of the Tripoli to Benghazi road, by planting mines or attacking vehicles with machine gun fire. The road was kept under constant observation around the clock from 2 March to 21 July 1942.|$|E
