5|$|Furious {{that her}} ploy has failed, Kundry tells Parsifal {{that if he}} can feel {{compassion}} for Amfortas, then {{he should be able}} to feel it for her as well. She has been cursed for centuries, unable to rest, because she saw Christ on the cross and laughed at His pains. Now she can never weep, only jeer, and she is enslaved to Klingsor as well. Parsifal rejects her again but then asks her to lead him to Amfortas. She begs him to stay with her for just one hour, and then she <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>him</b> to Amfortas. When he still refuses, she curses him to wander without ever finding the Kingdom of the Grail, and finally calls on her master Klingsor to help her.|$|E
25|$|As a bowler {{enters his}} {{delivery}} stride, the non-striking batsman usually 'backs up'. This means he leaves his popping crease and walks towards {{the other end}} of the wicket so that it <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>him</b> less time to reach the other end if he and his batting partner choose to attempt a run.|$|E
25|$|Chad's {{infrastructure}} minister, Adoum Younousmi, later said: “Chad is not {{a terrorist}} haven. He is a terrorist and we <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>him</b> to court”. A Chadian official subsequently identified him as being “close to” the Justice and Equality Movement rebel group. Sudan's Civil Aviation Authority also formed a separate committee specifically to investigate how Muhammed was able to pass through security undetected.|$|E

Biking routes are generally marked with red and white signs and the yellow lanes are exclusively meant for the bikers. Also hiking trails are well marked with yellow signs, which give the hiker the probable time it <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>him</b> to reach his destination. There are specific maps available for hiking and walking trails throughout Switzerland. Some of the most accessible walks in the Zürich area are the Uetliberg and the Zürichberg.|$|E

25|$|Fogg {{discovers that}} {{he missed his}} connection. He {{searches}} for a vessel that <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>him</b> to Yokohama, finding a pilot boat, the Tankadere, that takes him and Aouda to Shanghai, where they catch a steamer to Yokohama. In Yokohama, they search for Passepartout, believing {{that he may have}} arrived there on the Carnatic as originally planned. They find him in a circus, trying to earn the fare for his homeward journey. Reunited, the four board a paddle-steamer, the General Grant, taking them across the Pacific to San Francisco. Fix promises Passepartout that now, having left British soil, he will no longer try to delay Fogg's journey, but instead support him in getting back to Britain so he can arrest Fogg in Britain itself.|$|E

25|$|Zelena, Snow, David, and Hook {{soon find}} {{themselves}} in a new realm, but Zelena has no way to return as her wand broke upon arrival. The four come across a frightened groundsman who warns them they shouldn’t be there, only to have another man appear and use magic to knock the unwanted visitors out. Hours later, they wake up in a cage of enchanted bars and are greeted by the warden, who believes that the Dark One must have sent them; they are enemies. They convince the warden that Gold is their enemy as well, and their arrival was an accident on his part in trying to wake Belle; however, the warden keeps them prisoner anyhow. The groundsman then visits the four, and agrees to help them if they <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>him</b> to Storybrooke.|$|E
25|$|This song {{is divided}} in two movements, and its central theme are quasars, astronomical sources of {{electromagnetic}} energy which output {{massive amounts of}} light. A Quasar may readily release energy in levels equal to the output of dozens of average galaxies combined. In this song Arjen Lucassen adopts the most widely supported theory concerning the origin of quasars as true, that is, he implies they are gigantic supermassive black holes. Here, the colonist passes the Taurus Pulsar {{and goes to the}} center of Quasar 3C 273, hoping that its black hole <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>him</b> closer to Earth. Vocals on this song were provided by Andi Deris (from Helloween), Rene Merkelbach and Erik Norlander perform a keyboard solo each, and Arjen Lucassen provides a guitar solo. Backing vocals were provides by Lana Lane.|$|E

500|$|Basarab sent envoys {{who asked}} for the {{hostilities}} to cease, and in return offered to pay 7,000 marks in silver, submit the fortress of Severin to Robert, and send his own son as hostage.

[...] Another account writes that Robert said that: [...] "...he will drag the Voivode from his cottage, as would any driver his oxen or shepherd his sheep." ...|$|E
500|$|Mr. Nobody is a {{tale about}} choice. Nemo, a nine-year-old boy, has been thrust into a {{position}} where he must make an impossible decision – to choose between his mother and father. In the seconds preceding the rest of his life, he wonders where each choice <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>him.</b> The forces of the universe working to bring about total chaos are counteracted by this boy's overactive imagination. The dilemma that causes the film's main problem (not knowing the future) once solved makes it all the more difficult – [...] "I don't know the future, therefore I cannot make a decision. Now that I know the future I still cannot make one." [...] The eloquent interplay between philosophical lifestyle and what forges reality, is epitomized by the constant change in storyline, between young boy, adolescent, and mature man. The film takes a four-dimensionalists view of the nature and existence of life in the universe. Each decision thus branching off creating an entirely separate alternative universe. Mr. Nobody raises many ontological arguments about the subjective nature of time. How actions have universal consequences, how the past inevitably shapes the future in a very impacting way – every single choice, no matter its simplicity or complexity can make, alter or change a lifetime.|$|E

2500|$|Dennis Carroll (1982) {{associates}} the [...] "ordinary bloke" [...] with a form {{of masculine}} individualism unique to Australia: [...] "An individual who does not conform to the Australianist-related patterns of male behavior will be dismissed as an outsider... the kind of individualism based on too much success, wealth or power <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>him</b> beyond the valued reciprocates of egalitarian mateship. A man should be reasonably successful in areas which are not too threatening to others and remain an 'ordinary bloke', accessible, easy-going and sociable. Individualism is thus always... couched in terms of some approved, Australianist-related image of masculinity." ...|$|E

2500|$|Individuals with {{receptive}} aphasia may speak in long sentences {{that have no}} meaning, add unnecessary words, and even create new [...] "words" [...] (neologisms).

They have poor auditory and reading comprehension, and fluent, but nonsensical, oral and written expression. Individuals with receptive aphasia usually have great difficulty understanding the speech of both themselves and others and are, therefore, often unaware of their mistakes. Receptive language deficits usually arise from lesions in the posterior portion of the left hemisphere at or near Wernicke's area.|$|E
2500|$|Mann {{remained}} with the Packers through the 1954 NFL season. [...] Lee Remmel, {{who worked for}} the Packers in public relations and served as a team historian, described Mann as [...] "on the small side" [...] (5 feet 11inches, 175 pounds), but a [...] "nifty and productive wide receiver." [...] Green Bay Gazette sports writer Art Daley recalled a story involving Mann and teammate Dick Afflis, who later became known in professional wrestling as [...] "Dick the Bruiser." [...] The Packers stayed at a Baltimore hotel that would not allow Mann to stay with the team on account of a policy against allowing African-American guests. [...] When Mann left to go to another hotel, the 252-pound Afflis left with him. [...] When a cab driver told Afflis that he would not drive Mann because of his race, Afflis grabbed the driver by the shirt and said, [...] "You <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>him</b> wherever he wants to go." [...] Daley also recalled how he had protested the hotel not accepting Mann and Mann calmed him down by saying with a shrug, [...] "That's just politics." ...|$|E

Ham hanged himself in his garage studio in Woking later that morning. His suicide note—addressed to his girlfriend, Anne Herriot, and her son, Blair—blamed Polley for much of his despair and inability to cope with his disappointments in life. The note read: [...] "Anne, I love you. Blair, I love you. I will not be allowed to love and trust everybody. This is better. Pete. P.S. Stan Polley is a soulless bastard.
