[...] All channel-lining residues {{in the four}} monomeric channels are orientated in nearly identical positions except at the narrowest channel constriction, where the side chain of a conserved Arg-189 adopts two distinct orientations. In {{one of the four}} monomers, the guanidino group of Arg-189 points toward the periplasmic vestibule, opening up the constriction to accommodate the binding of a water molecule through a tridentate H-bond. In the other three monomers, the Arg-189 guanidino group bends over to form an H-bond with carbonyl oxygen of Thr-183 occluding the channel. Therefore, the tAqpZ structure has two different Arg-189 conformations which provide water permeation through the channel. Alternating between the two Arg-189 conformations disrupts continuous flow of water, thus regulating the open probability of the <b>water</b> <b>pore.</b> Further, the difference in Arg-189 displacements is correlated with a strong electron density found between the first transmembrane helices of two open channels, suggesting that the observed Arg-189 conformations are stabilized by asymmetrical subunit interactions in tAqpZ.

However, the mechanism of how DMSO increases membrane permeability has not been well understood. Recently, molecular dynamics simulations have demonstrated that DMSO can induce <b>water</b> <b>pores</b> in biological membranes, but no direct experimental evidence is so far available to prove the simulation result. Using FluxOR Tl+ influx assay and intracellular Ca 2 + imaging technique, we studied the effect of DMSO on Tl+ and Ca 2 + permeation across cell membranes. Upon application of DMSO on CHO-K 1 cell line, Tl+ influx was transiently increased in a dose-dependent manner. The increase in Tl+ permeability induced by DMSO was not changed in the presence of blockers for K+ channel and Na+-K+ ATPase, suggesting that Tl+ permeates through transient <b>water</b> <b>pores</b> induced by DMSO to enter into the cell. In addition, Ca 2 + permeability was significantly increased upon application of DMSO, indicating that the transient <b>water</b> <b>pores</b> induced by DMSO were non-selective pores. Furthermore, similar results could be obtained from RAW 264. 7 macrophage cell line. Therefore, this study provided experimental evidence to support the prediction that DMSO can induce transient <b>water</b> <b>pores</b> in cell membranes, which in turn facilitates the transport of active substances across membranes...|$|R

The composition pattern of PAHs in the three phases was dominated by high molecular weight PAHs, in particular 5 -ring PAHs. The salinity profile of dissolved PAHs suggested that they all behaved non-conservatively due to deviation from the theoretical dilution line. No correlation was found between PAH concentrations in sediment and those in <b>pore</b> <b>water,</b> and the correlation between the partition coefficients of PAHs and sediment organic carbon content was not significant, suggesting the complexity of the partition behaviour of PAHs.

Although site-directed mutagenesis has shown that mercury binds to Cys 189 during the inhibition process, it is not fully understood how this inhibits the water permeation through AQP 1. We carried out 40 ns molecular dynamics simulations of bovine AQP 1 tetramer with mercury (Hg-AQP 1) or without mercury (Free AQP 1). In Hg-AQP 1, Cys 191 (Cys 189 in human AQP 1) is converted to Cys-SHg+ in each monomer. During each last 10 ns, we observed water permeation events occurred 23 times in Free AQP 1 and never in Hg-AQP 1. Mercury binding did not influence the whole structure, but did induce a collapse in the orientation of several residues at the ar/R region. In Free AQP 1, backbone oxygen atoms of Gly 190, Cys 191, and Gly 192 lined, and were oriented to, {{the surface of the}} <b>water</b> <b>pore</b> channel. In Hg-AQP 1, however, the SHg+ of Cys 191 -SHg+ was oriented toward the outside of the <b>water</b> <b>pore.</b> As a result, the backbone oxygen atoms of Gly 190, Cys 191, and Gly 192 became disorganized and the ar/R region collapsed, thereby obstructing the permeation of water.

40|$|The {{potential}} of mean force (PMF) of a phospholipid in a bilayer {{is a key}} thermodynamic property that describes the energetic cost of localized lipid defects. We have calculated the PMF by umbrella sampling using molecular dynamics simulations. The profile has a deep minimum at the equilibrium position in the bilayer and steeply rises for displacements both deeper into the bilayer and {{moving away from the}} bilayer. As the lipid loses contact with the bilayer, the profile abruptly flattens without a significant barrier. The calculated free energy difference of 80 kJ/mol between the minimum of the PMF and the value in water agrees well with the free energy difference calculated from the experimentally measured critical micelle concentration. Significant water/lipid defects form when a lipid is forced into the bilayer interior, {{in the form of a}} small <b>water</b> <b>pore</b> that spans the membrane. The energy required to form such a <b>water</b> <b>pore</b> is also found to be 80 kJ/mol. On the basis of this energy, we estimate the lipid flip-flop rate and permeability rate of sodium ions.

A double bilayer setup was employed and different transmembrane potentials were generated by varying the anion (Cl−) (Cl−) and cation (Na+) (Na+) concentrations in the two water compartments. A transmembrane potential of ∼ 350  mV∼ 350 mV was thereby generated per bilayer for a unit charge imbalance. For transmembrane potential differences of up to ∼ 1. 4  V∼ 1. 4 V, the bilayers were stable, over the time scale of the simulations (10 – 50  ns) (10 – 50 ns).

However, seepage phenomena taking place within the dam may substantially modify <b>pore</b> <b>water</b> pressure distributions. In this context, the present paper represents and interprets the singular <b>pore</b> <b>water</b> pressure distributions measured within an Italian earth dam, pertaining {{to the type of}} zoned earth dam with an internal clay core. <b>Pore</b> <b>water</b> pressure interpretation is supported by the representation of the evolution of the measured seepage flows. The work shows that <b>pore</b> <b>water</b> pressure may differ strongly from the nominal distribution during the first stages of the dam's life, when, if nearly undrained conditions take place, <b>pore</b> <b>water</b> pressures are discontinuous {{as a result of their}} dependency on total stresses. <b>Pore</b> <b>water</b> pressure may also assume other than expected distributions after some decades of operation, this time as a result of suffusion phenomena induced by seepage processes within the dam embankment. Measured <b>pore</b> <b>water</b> pressure distribution, suitably interpreted as piezometric head contours, clearly show that part of the downstream shell contributes to embankment water-tightness. © 2012 ejge...|$|R

Then, a dynamic analysis of dam was made using three-dimension finite element method TSDA. Dynamic <b>water</b> <b>pore</b> pressure and permanent deformation were certified. The results compared well with the monitor data, {{so it could be}} concluded that the current seismic theory and calculation method for earth dam are workable.

The catalysts {{were characterized by}} X-ray diffraction pattern and temperature pro-grammed reduction techniques. Surface area and pore size distribution were determined by nitrogen physisorption tech-nique. The activities of the catalysts were measured toward n-pentane isomerization reaction in a pulse micro-catalytic re-actor operated under atmospheric pressure and at reaction temperature ranged from 200 - 450 oC. The {{results indicated that the}} selectivity of the Pt-Sn/kaolinite catalysts toward iso-pentane formation decreased from ethanol to acetone and then to <b>water.</b> <b>Pore</b> size distribution and diffusion coefficient of reactant and products are responsible for the high selectivity of Pt-Sn /kaolinte (ethanol) catalyst towards iso-pentane formation...|$|E
40|$|After the {{foundation}} piles have been {{installed in the}} ground, the increase of their load capacity may be observed, due to the dissipation of ground <b>water</b> <b>pore</b> pressures (reconsolidation of the soil) and the reestablishment of internal bindings around the pile. Hence, the norms and regulations recommend that the pile load capacity tests should be carried out from several to dozens days after the piles have been constructed. The article presents the test results for capacity tests performed before the norm-conditioned time limit, {{with reference to the}} soil types. The subject has been exemplified on the basis of foundation works in course of the construction of several road projects in Poland since 2004...|$|E

The paragenetic sequences of authigenic minerals {{both in the}} sandy and fine-grained sediments (mudstones and siltstones) indicate red bed diagenetic trend.
