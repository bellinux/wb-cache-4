2500|$|The actual {{engraving}} {{is traditionally}} {{done by a}} combination of pressure and manipulating the <b>work-piece.</b> The traditional [...] "hand push" [...] process is still practiced today, but modern technology has brought various mechanically assisted engraving systems. Most pneumatic engraving systems require an air source that drives air through a hose into a handpiece, which resembles a traditional engraving handle in many cases, that powers a mechanism (usually a piston). The air is actuated by either a foot control (like a gas pedal or sewing machine) or newer palm / hand control. This mechanism replaces either the [...] "hand push" [...] effort or the effects of a hammer. The internal mechanisms move at speeds up to 15,000 strokes per minute, thereby greatly reducing the effort needed in traditional hand engraving. These types of pneumatic systems are used for power assistance only and do not guide or control the engraving artist. One of the major benefits of using a pneumatic system for hand engraving is the reduction of fatigue and decrease in time spent working.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{different approaches}} to creating mathematical models to provide abrasive finishing. It highlights the features of abrasive finishing of precision parts at the final processing stages. The paper persuasively argues {{that it is necessary}} to take into consideration the law of size distribution in the batch of simultaneously treated <b>work-pieces</b> with double-sided lapping of precision plane-parallel and cylindrical parts, such as end bars and cylinders for measuring the pitch diameter. The paper also proposes geometric models of the batch of simultaneously treated <b>work-pieces</b> for plane-parallel and cylindrical parts when lapping them in a double-disk lapping machine as a "general work-piece". On the basis of geometrical models an expression is created to calculate the change of a working pressure or the distributed load (for cylindrical parts) in the process of abrasive finishing. The paper presents the experimental study results of changing geometrical dimensions in the batch of <b>work-pieces</b> of the end measures of length in abrasive process thereby confirming the validity of the proposed approach to creating model. There is a justification that in the mathematical model should be introduced expressions describing the change of abrasiveness of the abrasive used for different kinds of lapping, including that of applied to the final lapping. A mathematical model is presented in the form of integrodifferential equations describing how the rate of linear material removal in double-sided finishing depends on the speed of relative movement of the <b>work-pieces</b> on the lap (sanding block), as well as on the pressure or distributed load (for cylindrical parts), and acceleration of relative motion, with appropriate exponents. The expression taking into account the change of the abrasiveness of the abrasive used is introduced in the differential equation. The model is presented in a generalized form, taking into account all possible processing factors. In specific cases it can be significantly simplified. The model can be used to calculate the finishing machine rates of processing the batches of <b>work-pieces...</b>|$|R

Stress- and strain-dependent phase transformations, transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP), and its interactions with plasticity are important phenomena of both {{theoretical and practical}} interest, as they may cause distortion of <b>work-pieces.</b> These phenomena continue to be intensively studied both experimentally and theoretically.

Due to the possible interaction (coupling) of TRIP and plasticity, the usual approach in plasticity without phase transformations has to be modified substantially.

50|$|Often {{referred}} to as a bearing heater, the mains frequency unit employs standard transformer principles for its operation. An internal winding is wound around a laminated core similar to a standard mains transformer. The core is then passed through the <b>work-piece</b> and when the primary coil is energised, a magnetic flux is created around the core. The <b>work-piece</b> acts as a short circuit secondary of the transformer created, and due to the laws of induction, a current flows in the <b>work-piece</b> and heat is generated. The core is normally hinged or clamped in some way to allow loading or unloading, which is usually a manual operation. To cover variations in part diameter, the majority of units will have spare cores available which help to optimise performance. Once the part is heated to the correct temperature, assembly can take place either by hand or in the relevant jig or machine press.|$|E

40|$|With the aim to {{investigate}} modifications in electric resistivity, mechanical properties and structures of Al/Cu clad composites induced by various thermomechanical treatments, Al/Cu <b>work-pieces</b> were swaged under two temperatures to three final diameters and subsequently subjected to two different heat treatments.

The highest tensile strength (- 500 MPa) was recorded after the semi-final swaging pass for both of the composites. The strain imposed during the gradual swaging process significantly influenced hardness of both of the metals in the composites, the development of which was non-linear. Structure analyses confirmed restoration processes in Cu to occur during swaging to 5 mm at 25 degrees C, however, at 250 degrees C the restoration occurred during the last but one pass to 7. 5 mm already. The structural changes also induced simultaneous texture modifications. The heat treatment introduced further structure changes; the 350 degrees C annealing temperature resulted {{in the development of}} an intermetallic layer on the Al/Cu interfaces, which also contributed to decreases in mechanical properties.

40|$|The paper {{contains}} definitions for {{a process}} and a methodology for restoration of parts {{on the basis}} of the analysis of the known methods and their selection. Geometric parameters and operational properties that should be provided for restoration of parts have been determined in the paper. A process for selection of the required method for restoration parts has been improved and it makes it possible to synthesize an optimal process of the restoration according to a criterion of industrial resource consumption with due account of quality, productivity and security limits. A justification on measures that meet the required limits has been presented in the paper. The paper shows a direction of technical solutions that ensure complete use of residual life of repair fund parts. These solutions can be achieved through close application of all repair sizes of <b>work-pieces</b> with revision of their values, uniform removal of the allowance while cutting the <b>work-pieces</b> at optimum locating, application of coating processes only in technically justified cases, application of straightening with thermal fixing of its results or all-around compression of deformable elements.

Number of shaft journal building-up should be limited by one building-up operation throughout the whole life cycle of the part with the purpose to preserve its length within the prescribed limits.
