Cain began the season as the team's fourth starter. Entering the season, he was again ranked as the Giants' top prospect by Baseball America, which also named him the 10th-best prospect in baseball.|$|E

5|$|During Hunt's injury, Bennett moved Broncos {{teammate}} Justin Hodges to fullback and Hodges <b>was</b> <b>impressive</b> in the position. When Hunt {{returned to}} the Broncos side in Round 25 against the Parramatta Eels, {{he was forced to}} play on the wing due to Hodges' good form. Hunt and Hodges continued to switch the fullback position {{for the remainder of the}} season. Hunt missed the first week of the finals due to a hamstring problem but was able to return a week later.|$|E

5|$|Early {{experiments}} with floating petroleum {{on the sea}} and igniting it were not entirely successful: the fuel was difficult to ignite, large quantities were required to cover even modest areas and the weapon was easily disrupted by waves. However, the potential was clear. By early 1941 a flame barrage technique was developed. Rather than attempting to ignite oil floating on water, nozzles were placed above high-water mark with pumps producing sufficient pressure to spray fuel which produced a roaring wall of flame over, rather than on, the water. Such installations consumed considerable resources and although this weapon <b>was</b> <b>impressive,</b> its network of pipes was vulnerable to pre-landing bombardment; General Brooke did not consider it effective. Initially ambitious plans were cut back to cover {{just a few miles}} of beaches.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} a mixed reception from critics. Author John Sellers listed {{it among the}} weirder arcade games released. Clare Edgeley of Computer and Video Games echoed similar statements. She criticized the game, stating that the constant blue background was dull and the game lacked longevity. Retro Gamers Darran Jones described the game as engrossing and obscure. He also expressed disappointment that few people remember it. Brett Alan Weiss of AllGame called Bubbles a slightly underrated game. He stated that while it lacked excitement, its gameplay was enjoyable. Weiss further commented that the control scheme was unique for its time, and {{that the number of}} on-screen objects moving smoothly <b>was</b> <b>impressive.</b>|$|E
5|$|At St Peter's School, Crawford {{combined}} {{his teaching}} role with supervision of sports, including acting as {{coach for the}} cricket team. On several occasions, he had to request leave from the headmaster to play first-class cricket. After arriving in Australia in December 1909, he was playing district cricket for East Torrens within a week, and played in South Australia's last three matches in the Sheffield Shield competition; the team {{went on to win}} the trophy for the first time since 1893–94. Crawford played a large part in this success. There was some controversy over his eligibility to play; New South Wales initially protested, but there was a precedent for ignoring the requirement of a three-month qualification period, and the New South Wales Cricket Association (NSWCA) Executive Committee accepted this in the case of Crawford, to the displeasure of the full NSWCA. Over four seasons, Crawford played 22 matches for South Australia, scoring 1,512 runs at an average of 40.86 and taking 120 wickets at 23.86. Green suggests that such a performance would have earned him Test selection if he had been Australian, and Wisden noted that his record in Australia <b>was</b> <b>impressive.</b>|$|E

5|$|Celtic {{reached the}} European Cup final again in 1970. Celtic knocked out Basel {{in the first}} round, then {{defeated}} Portuguese side Benfica 3–0 at Parkhead in {{the first leg of}} the second round. Celtic's performance <b>was</b> <b>impressive,</b> and they were unfortunate not to score more. Benfica rallied in the return match and put Celtic under intense pressure from the start. John Fallon was outstanding in goal for Celtic and with the game nearing its end had limited the score to 2–0 for the Portuguese side. Diamantino, however, scored direct from a free-kick in the final minute to level the tie on aggregate and force extra-time. No further goals were scored in the additional 30 minutes, and the tie was decided by the toss of a coin. Captain Billy McNeill successfully called, and Celtic progressed to the quarter-finals. Celtic were unhappy that the tie had been decided in this manner, and suggested to UEFA an alternative of using a scoreline {{based on the number of}} corners forced in extra-time. UEFA rejected this proposal, but soon afterwards introduced penalty kick shoot-outs in the European Cup to decide drawn ties after extra-time. Celtic went on to face Italian champions Fiorentina in the quarter-finals, winning 3–1 on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|Ganguly {{was part}} of the Indian team that competed in the 1999 Cricket World Cup in England. During the match against Sri Lanka at Taunton, India chose to bat. After Sadagoppan Ramesh was bowled, Ganguly scored 183 from 158balls, and hit 17fours and seven sixes. It became the second highest score in World Cup history and the highest by an Indian in the tournament. His {{partnership}} of 318 with Rahul Dravid is the highest overall score in a World Cup and is the second highest in all ODI cricket. In 1999–00, India lost Test series to both Australia and South Africa that involved a combined total of five Tests. Ganguly struggled scoring 224runs at 22.40; however his ODI form <b>was</b> <b>impressive,</b> with five centuries over the season taking him {{to the top of the}} PwC One Day Ratings for batsmen. Around the same time, allegations came that Ganguly was romantically involved with South Indian actress Nagma, something he denied.|$|E
5|$|Gilligan {{was born}} in Denmark Hill, an area of Camberwell in London. He was the second of three sons, all of whom played {{first-class}} cricket, to Willie Austin Gilligan and Alice Eliza Kimpton. The family had a strong connection with Sussex; Gilligan followed Sussex County Cricket Club as a child, and later played club cricket there. After attending Fairfield School, he was educated at Dulwich College from 1906 until 1914 where he established a sporting reputation in athletics and cricket. In the latter sport, {{he played in the}} school first eleven, as did his brothers; in 1913, all three boys played in the team. Gilligan played in the eleven between 1911 and 1914 and captained the side in his final two years. In 1914, he came top of the school batting and bowling averages. Selected to play representative schools cricket at Lord's Cricket Ground in 1914, he took ten wickets in total and scored one fifty in the two matches. By the standards of school cricket, his pace <b>was</b> <b>impressive,</b> and Surrey invited him to play for their second eleven during the school holidays of 1913 and 1914; his father was a member of that county's committee, and Gilligan qualified to play through his London birth.|$|E

5|$|Zoldak {{was moved}} to a relief role {{full-time}} for the 1949 Cleveland Indians season {{due to a lack}} of depth with the departures of Ed Klieman and Russ Christopher. On July 27, Zoldak managed to hit his only career home run against the New York Yankees off Ed Lopat. However, the game was rained out, and the only home run of his career was erased. In 27 games that season, Zoldak had a 12 record with a 4.25 ERA. Zoldak had struggled in spring training the prior year due to both being out of shape and a lack of pitching control, but <b>was</b> <b>impressive</b> enough in 1950 after losing the weight and regaining his control that manager Lou Boudreau decided to put him in the starting rotation to begin the year. He pitched poorly in his first starts, and was placed back in the bullpen for the rest of the year; Indians management considered demoting him to the minor leagues, and would have been sent to the San Diego Padres in May if not for the intervention of Johnny Berardino, who wanted to play on the west coast and agreed to a demotion instead. Zoldak spent the full season with Cleveland, and had a 42 record and a 3.96 ERA in 33 games.|$|E
