5|$|H. reaumuri {{differs from}} other desert <b>woodlice</b> {{in a number}} of respects. It is crepuscular, while other species are nocturnal. Apart from at the highest temperatures, it is also {{positively}} phototactic (is attracted to sunlight), while other species are negatively phototactic (move away from bright light). Compared to other <b>woodlice,</b> H. reaumuri walks in an unusual manner, with its body held high off the ground.|$|E
5|$|Oniscidea â€“ Semi-{{terrestrial}} and terrestrial isopods fully {{adapted for}} life on land. There are over 4,000 species of <b>woodlice</b> inhabiting forests, mountains, deserts and the littoral zone.|$|E
5|$|In many decapods, {{the first}} (and {{sometimes}} the second) pair of pleopods are specialised {{in the male}} for sperm transfer. Many terrestrial crustaceans (such as the Christmas Island red crab) mate seasonally {{and return to the}} sea to release the eggs. Others, such as <b>woodlice,</b> lay their eggs on land, albeit in damp conditions. In most decapods, the females retain the eggs until they hatch into free-swimming larvae.|$|E
5|$|Malacostracans {{live in a}} {{wide range}} of marine and {{freshwater}} habitats, and three orders have terrestrial members: Amphipoda (Talitridae), Isopoda (Oniscidea, the <b>woodlice)</b> and Decapoda (terrestrial hermit crabs, crabs of the families Ocypodidae, Gecarcinidae, and Grapsidae, and terrestrial crayfish). They are abundant in all marine ecosystems, and most species are scavengers, although some, such as the porcelain crabs, are filter feeders, and some, such as mantis shrimps, are carnivores.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species can}} roll {{themselves}} into a ball, a behaviour used in defence that also conserves moisture. Members of the families Ligiidae and Tylidae, commonly known as rock lice or sea slaters, are the least specialised of the <b>woodlice</b> for life on land. They inhabit the splash zone on rocky shores, jetties and pilings, may hide under debris washed up on the shore and can swim if immersed in water.|$|E
5|$|This species forages almost {{exclusively}} from the ground, where it alternates between remaining still and watching attentively and actively searching {{for it by}} rummaging through deep leaf litter. It eats {{a wide range of}} invertebrates, including ants, beetles, butterflies, caterpillars, cockroaches, grasshoppers, <b>woodlice,</b> and worms, and occasionally small vertebrates. Despite the long-tailed ground roller's poor flying abilities, it has been seen catching butterflies in midair.|$|E
5|$|Like other newts, Triturus {{species are}} {{carnivorous}} and feed mainly on invertebrates. During the land phase, prey include earthworms and other annelids, different insects, <b>woodlice,</b> and snails and slugs. During the breeding season, they prey on various aquatic invertebrates, and also tadpoles of other amphibians {{such as the}} common frog or common toad, and smaller newts. Larvae, depending on their size, eat small invertebrates and tadpoles, and also smaller larvae of their own species.|$|E
5|$|Malacostraca is {{the largest}} of the six classes of crustaceans, {{containing}} about 40,000 living species, divided among 16 orders. Its members, the malacostracans, display a great diversity of body forms and include crabs, lobsters, crayfish, shrimp, krill, <b>woodlice,</b> amphipods, mantis shrimp and many other, less familiar animals. They are abundant in all marine environments and have colonised freshwater and terrestrial habitats. They are segmented animals, united by a common body plan comprising 20 body segments (rarely 21), and divided into a head, thorax, and abdomen.|$|E
5|$|The grey currawong is an {{omnivorous}} and opportunistic feeder. It preys on many invertebrates, such as snails, spiders and <b>woodlice,</b> and a {{wide variety}} of insects including beetles, earwigs, cockroaches, wasps, ants and grasshoppers, and smaller vertebrates, including frogs, lizards such as the bearded dragon as well as skinks, rats, mice, and nestlings or young of Tasmanian nativehen, red wattlebird, eastern spinebill, house sparrow (Passer domesticus), and splendid fairywren (M. splendens), It has been recorded hunting at the nests of the superb fairywren (Malurus cyaneus), and the bell miner (Manorina melanophrys).|$|E
5|$|The {{tree sparrow}} is a {{predominantly}} seed and grain eating bird which feeds {{on the ground}} in flocks, often with house sparrows, finches, or buntings. It eats weed seeds, such as chickweeds and goosefoot, spilled grain, and it may also visit feeding stations, especially for peanuts. It will also feed on invertebrates, especially during the breeding season when the young are fed mainly on animal food; it takes insects, <b>woodlice,</b> millipedes, centipedes, spiders and harvestmen.|$|E
5|$|Brachycera are ecologically very diverse, {{with many}} being predatory at the larval stage and some being parasitic. Animals {{parasitised}} include molluscs, <b>woodlice,</b> millipedes, insects, mammals, and amphibians. Flies are {{the second largest}} group of pollinators after the Hymenoptera (bees, wasps and relatives). In wet and colder environments flies are significantly more important as pollinators. Compared to bees, they need less food as {{they do not need}} to provision their young. Many flowers that bear low nectar and those that have evolved trap pollination depend on flies. It is thought that some of the earliest pollinators of plants may have been flies.|$|E
5|$|Isopods {{belong to}} the larger group Peracarida, which are united by the {{presence}} of a special chamber under the thorax for brooding eggs. They have a cosmopolitan distribution and over 10,000 species of isopod, classified into 11 suborders, have been described worldwide. Around 4,500 species are found in marine environments, mostly on the sea floor. About 500 species are found in fresh water and another 5,000 species are the terrestrial <b>woodlice,</b> which form the suborder Oniscidea. In the deep sea, members of the suborder Asellota predominate, to the near exclusion of all other isopods, having undergone a large adaptive radiation in that environment. The largest isopod is in the genus Bathynomus and some large species are fished commercially for human food in Mexico, Japan and Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|Isopoda is {{an order}} of {{crustaceans}} that includes <b>woodlice</b> and their relatives. Isopods live in the sea, in fresh water, or on land. All have rigid, segmented exoskeletons, two pairs of antennae, seven pairs of jointed limbs on the thorax, and five pairs of branching appendages on the abdomen {{that are used in}} respiration. Females brood their young in a pouch under their thorax. Isopods have various feeding methods: some eat dead or decaying plant and animal matter, others are grazers, or filter feeders, a few are predators, and some are internal or external parasites, mostly of fishes. Aquatic species mostly live on the seabed or bottom of freshwater bodies of water, but some more derived taxa can swim for a short distance. Terrestrial forms move around by crawling and tend to be found in cool, moist places. Some species are able to roll themselves into a ball as a defence mechanism or to conserve moisture.|$|E
5|$|Isopods are detritivores, browsers, {{carnivores}} (including {{predators and}} scavengers), parasites, and filter feeders, and may occupy {{one or more}} of these feeding niches. Only aquatic and marine species are known to be parasites or filter feeders. Some exhibit coprophagia and will also consume their own fecal pellets. Terrestrial species are in general herbivorous, with <b>woodlice</b> feeding on moss, bark, algae, fungi and decaying material. In marine isopods that feed on wood, cellulose is digested by enzymes secreted in the caeca. Limnoria lignorum, for example, bores into wood and additionally feeds on the mycelia of fungi attacking the timber, thus increasing the nitrogen in its diet. Land-based wood-borers mostly house symbiotic bacteria in the hindgut which aid in digesting cellulose. There are numerous adaptations to this simple gut, but these are mostly correlated with diet rather than by taxonomic group.|$|E
5|$|Most {{crustaceans}} are free-living aquatic animals, {{but some}} are terrestrial (e.g. <b>woodlice),</b> some are parasitic (e.g. Rhizocephala, fish lice, tongue worms) and some are sessile (e.g. barnacles). The group has an extensive fossil record, reaching back to the Cambrian, and includes living fossils such as Triops cancriformis, which has existed apparently unchanged since the Triassic period. More than 10 million tons of crustaceans are produced by fishery or farming for human consumption, the majority of it being shrimp and prawns. Krill and copepods are not as widely fished, but may be the animals with the greatest biomass on the planet, and form {{a vital part of}} the food chain. The scientific study of crustaceans is known as carcinology (alternatively, malacostracology, crustaceology or crustalogy), and a scientist who works in carcinology is a carcinologist.|$|E
5|$|The <b>woodlice,</b> {{suborder}} Oniscidea, are {{the most}} successful group of terrestrial crustaceans and show various adaptations for life on land. They are subject to evaporation, especially from their ventral area, and as {{they do not have}} a waxy cuticle, they need to conserve water, often living in a humid environment and sheltering under stones, bark, debris or leaf litter. Desert species are usually nocturnal, spending the day in an underground burrow and emerging at night. Moisture is obtained through food sources or by drinking, and some species can form their paired uropodal appendages into a tube and funnel water from dewdrops onto their pleopods. In many taxa, the respiratory structures on the endopods are internal, with a spiracle and pseudotrachaea, which resemble lungs. In others, the endopod is folded inside the adjoining exopod (outer branch of the pleopod). Both these arrangements help to prevent evaporation from the respiratory surfaces.|$|E
5|$|If early {{tetrapods}} {{lived in}} freshwater, {{and if they}} {{lost the ability to}} produce urea and used ammonia only, they would have to evolve it from scratch again later. Not a single species of all the ray-finned fishes living today has been able to do that, so it is not likely the tetrapods would have done so either. Terrestrial animals that can only produce ammonia would have to drink constantly, making a life on land impossible (a few exceptions exist, as some terrestrial <b>woodlice</b> can excrete their nitrogenous waste as ammonia gas). This probably also was a problem at the start when the tetrapods started to spend time out of water, but eventually the urea system would dominate completely. Because of this it is not likely they emerged in freshwater (unless they first migrated into freshwater habitats and then migrated onto land so shortly after that they still retained the ability to make urea), although some species never left, or returned to, the water could of course have adapted to freshwater lakes and rivers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Woodlice</b> in {{the genus}} Armadillidium {{and in the}} family Armadillidae can roll up into an almost perfect sphere as a {{defensive}} mechanism, hence some of the common names such as pill bug, or roly-poly. Most <b>woodlice,</b> however, cannot do this.|$|E
25|$|Common {{names for}} <b>woodlice</b> vary {{throughout}} the English-speaking world. A number of common names {{make reference to}} the fact that some species of <b>woodlice</b> can roll up into a ball. Other names compare the woodlouse to a pig.|$|E
25|$|<b>Woodlice</b> are {{eaten by}} {{a wide range of}} insectivores, and some animals are known to prey {{exclusively}} on <b>woodlice,</b> for example, spiders of the genus Dysdera, such as the woodlouse spider Dysdera crocata, and land planarians of the genus Luteostriata, such as Luteostriata abundans.|$|E
25|$|Pillbugs (<b>woodlice</b> of {{the family}} Armadillidiidae, also known as pill <b>woodlice)</b> can be {{confused}} with pill millipedes of the order Glomerida. Both of these groups of terrestrial segmented arthropods {{are about the same}} size. They live in very similar habitats, and they can both roll up into a ball. Pill millipedes and pillbugs appear superficially similar to the naked eye. This is an example of convergent evolution.|$|E
25|$|When {{rolled into}} a ball, G. marginata can be {{distinguished}} from a rolledâ€“up pill woodlouse by the asymmetrical ball it rolls into; pill <b>woodlice</b> roll into much more perfect spheres. The cuticle is also darker and shinier, and the antennae are shorter. The head and tail of a woodlouse have {{a greater number of}} small plates, while the head of Glomeris is protected by a single large shield, and it lacks the uropods of <b>woodlice</b> at the read end. Although usually black, red, yellow and brown individuals do occasionally occur.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>woodlice,</b> like earthworms, are {{generally}} considered beneficial in gardens for {{their role in}} controlling pests, producing compost and overturning the soil, they have also been known to feed on cultivated plants, such as ripening strawberries and tender seedlings.|$|E
25|$|Dysdera {{are one of}} the few known {{arthropods}} to {{hunt and}} prey on <b>woodlice,</b> which is their main food source. Their wide jaws and large fangs help to overcome <b>woodlice</b> hard armor like shells, as well as their ability to release chemicals to keep them out of harm's way. These adaptations also enable them to prey on other common ground-dwelling invertebrates such as silverfish, earwigs, millipedes, and small burying beetles. Dysdera crocata is the only species from the Dysdera family to prey on other spiders. Dysdera spiders' huge, sharp fangs make them very powerful predators for their size, allowing them to dominate, and sometimes kill, competitors such as centipedes and other spiders.|$|E
25|$|Red-headed trogons feed {{primarily}} on insects and their larvae {{found in the}} foliage, on tree branches or in mid air. They also eat leaves and fruits. Some food items include green orthopterans, stick-insects, cicadas, millipedes, flies, beetles, centipedes, <b>woodlice</b> and moths.|$|E
25|$|<b>Woodlice</b> {{can also}} invade homes en masse {{in search of}} {{moisture}} and their presence can indicate dampness problems. They are not generally regarded as a serious household pest as they do not spread disease and do not damage sound wood or structures.|$|E
25|$|Young isopod {{crustaceans}} hatch {{directly into}} a manca stage, which is similar in appearance to the adult. The lack of a free-swimming larval form has led to high rates of endemism in isopods, but has also allowed them to colonise the land, {{in the form of}} the <b>woodlice.</b>|$|E
25|$|A few <b>woodlice</b> have {{returned}} to water. Evolutionary ancient species are amphibious, such as the marine-intertidal sea slater (Ligia oceanica), which belongs to family Ligiidae. Other examples include some Haloniscus species from Australia (family Scyphacidae), and in the northern hemisphere several species of Trichoniscidae and Thailandoniscus annae (family Styloniscidae). Species for which aquatic life is assumed include Typhlotricholigoides aquaticus (Mexico) and Cantabroniscus primitivus (Spain).|$|E
25|$|The weaving was {{performed}} by the women and used the cotton cultivated in the warmer climates, traded for salt or ceramics. Wooden spindles and clay rolls were used to perform the weaving of braided or tied cloths and mantles. Also nets were made of cotton. Needles were made of gold or bone. The cloths were painted black, red and other colours with clay rollers and pencils. As paint the Muisca women used indigo, <b>woodlice</b> (purple), saffron (gold), plants of the acanthus family and Bocconia frutescens (orange) and other natural inks.|$|E
25|$|Black widow spiders {{typically}} prey on {{a variety}} of insects, but occasionally they do feed on <b>woodlice,</b> diplopods, chilopods and other arachnids. The spider's web is even strong enough to catch animals as large as mice. When the prey is entangled by the web, Latrodectus mactans quickly comes out of its retreat, wraps the prey securely in its strong web, then bites and envenoms its prey. The venom takes about ten minutes to take effect; in the meantime, the prey is held tightly by the spider. When movements of the prey cease, digestive enzymes are released into the wound. The black widow spider then carries its prey back to its retreat before feeding.|$|E
25|$|He {{wrote an}} {{unsuccessful}} drama, Le Candidate, and published a reworked version of The Temptation of Saint Anthony, portions {{of which had}} been published as early as 1857. He devoted much of his time to an ongoing project, Les Deux Cloportes (The Two <b>Woodlice),</b> which later became Bouvard et PÃ©cuchet, breaking the obsessive project only to write the Three Tales in 1877. This book comprises three stories: Un CÅ“ur simple (A Simple Heart), La LÃ©gende de Saint-Julien l'Hospitalier (The Legend of St. Julian the Hospitaller), and HÃ©rodias (Herodias). After the publication of the stories, he spent the remainder of his life toiling on the unfinished Bouvard et PÃ©cuchet, which was posthumously printed in 1881. It was a grand satire on the futility of human knowledge and the ubiquity of mediocrity. He believed the work to be his masterpiece, though the posthumous version received lukewarm reviews. Flaubert was a prolific letter writer, and his letters have been collected in several publications.|$|E
500|$|Potter was an unsentimental naturalist {{who thought}} no {{creature}} either good or bad, {{and had no}} qualms describing earwigs in Mrs. Tittlemouse's passage or <b>woodlice</b> in her pantry. Her publisher Harold Warne however had different ideas about what was appropriate for a children's book. He had become accustomed to Potter's unusual choice of animal subjects through the years, but, ever sensitive to public reaction, thought she had gone a bit too far in Mrs. Tittlemouse with the earwig and the <b>woodlice.</b> [...] The earwig was, at his behest, transmogrified into a beetle and the <b>woodlice</b> into [...] "creepy-crawly people" [...] hiding in Mrs. Tittlemouse's plate rack. [...] "I can alter the text, when I get the proofs," [...] she wrote, [...] "and will erase the offensive word 'wood-lice'!" [...] Potter argued for the generic term [...] "slaters" [...] for the <b>woodlice,</b> but was overruled. It was decided that an illustration of a centipede (Miss Maggie Manylegs) would be withdrawn and replaced with a butterfly.|$|E
500|$|Crustaceans (Crustacea [...] ) form a large, diverse {{arthropod}} taxon {{which includes}} such familiar animals as crabs, lobsters, crayfish, shrimp, krill, <b>woodlice</b> and barnacles.|$|E
500|$|Hemilepistus reaumuri is {{approximately}} [...] long, and [...] wide. In common with other <b>woodlice,</b> it has seven pairs of legs {{and a pair}} of conspicuous antennae. It is classified in the family Trachelipodidae; within that family, it is placed in the genus Hemilepistus {{because of the presence of}} tubercles only on the head and the nearby parts of the thorax.|$|E
500|$|The female bears 50â€“100 live young, {{typically}} in May. The young {{remain in the}} burrow for 10â€“20 days, being provided with food by their parents. On leaving the burrow, they are wary of other families, and adults may catch other adults' offspring and feed them to their own, but do not normally attack their own children. Members of each social group recognise each other using pheromones. Each pair only produces one brood, {{and the life of}} an [...] individual of H. reaumuri is typically around 15 months long, considerably shorter than the 2â€“4 year lifespans of <b>woodlice</b> from more mesic habitats, such as Armadillidium vulgare, Porcellio scaber or Philoscia muscorum.|$|E
500|$|Kutzer {{thinks the}} tale has a [...] "nightmarish quality". Poor Mrs. Tittlemouse cannot keep {{one step ahead}} of the various intruders. Although the house is her own, she has no control over who inhabits it: she finds bees nesting in an empty {{storeroom}} and <b>woodlice</b> hiding in the plate rack. She is trapped in her own home, her hours occupied with fighting off invaders from without to the point where she is sure she will [...] "go distracted". Although Mr. Jackson drives the unwanted intruders away, he leaves behind a mess of honey smears, moss, thistledown, and dirty footprints that Mrs. Tittlemouse invests two weeks of her life into cleaning up.|$|E
