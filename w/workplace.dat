We present new evidence on the association using perceptions of a representative sample of workers and an innovative testing framework. The evidence reveals that high performance <b>workplaces</b> are no more likely to make commitments to provide family friendly <b>workplaces</b> than are other <b>workplaces.</b> It shows, however, that high performance <b>workplaces</b> are more likely to keep the family friendly commitments they make, thereby maintaining a psychological contract based on mutual obligation. As providing family friendly practices requires both making and keeping commitments, the evidence confirms that high performance <b>workplaces</b> are more likely to provide such practices...|$|R

The remainder of segregation - systematic segregation - is upheld because employees that are recruited to <b>workplaces</b> tend {{to be similar to}} those already employed there, not because underrepresented groups within <b>workplaces</b> are systematically screened out of them. This homosocial inflow of employees appears largely to be sustained by employers’ tendency to select new employees from a pool of <b>workplaces</b> where its employees have been employed previously. workplaces; segregation; ethnicity; simulation...|$|R
