2500|$|The {{steamship}} tickets he {{had bought}} that morning for the return to Europe with Caresse were in his pocket.

The coroner concluded that Josephine had died at least two hours before Crosby. There was no suicide note, and newspapers ran sensational articles for days about the murder or suicide pact—they could not decide which.|$|E
