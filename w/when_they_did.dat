5|$|Improvements in Norfolk's road {{infrastructure}} {{and the development}} of the stagecoach system made Norwich an increasingly popular destination with travellers. Norwich was recovering from the plague years and was a major city, with attractions and social events second only to London itself. The increasingly prosperous country landowners of Norfolk and Suffolk began visiting Norwich more frequently and staying for longer <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> so.|$|E
5|$|James Gunn, a {{historian}} of science fiction, regarded the magazine {{as the best}} of the fantasy magazines launched in the early 1950s, and science fiction encyclopedist Donald H. Tuck contended it printed very good material. Not every critic viewed Beyond as completely successful, however; P. Schuyler Miller, in a 1963 review, commented that the stories were most successful <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not try to emulate Unknown.|$|E
5|$|Kinzer {{delivered}} the post-score kickoff, and NC State began its final drive {{of the first}} quarter at its 32-yard line with 1:01 remaining. The Wolfpack picked up a quick first down but were forced to punt <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not gain another. NC State's punt was returned to the Tech 13-yard line and the quarter came to an end with Virginia Tech leading, 107.|$|E

5|$|The Columbia {{report also}} found a failure in journalistic {{standards}} by either not making contact with the people they were publishing derogatory information about, or <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>did,</b> by not providing enough context {{for people to be}} able to offer a meaningful response. The report also states that the article misled readers with quotes where attribution was unclear and used pseudonyms inappropriately as a way to address these shortcomings.|$|E
5|$|Newton {{returned}} to play three further matches for Somerset in 1887 and 1890, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not hold first-class status. He opened the innings {{for the county}} twice in 1887, passing 20 on {{three out of four}} occasions. During Somerset's successful 1890 season, when they remained unbeaten against other county opposition, Newton batted at number four, scoring 3 and 0, his final recorded appearance for Somerset. CricketArchive records one further appearance for Newton, playing in Felixstowe for the MCC against Suffolk in 1905, aged 52. Opening the batting, he scored 87 to help his side to a nine wicket victory.|$|E
5|$|Producer Frank Marshall {{stated in}} 2003 {{that the film}} would use {{traditional}} stunt work {{so as to be}} consistent with the previous films. CGI was used to remove the visible safety wires on the actors <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> their stunts (such as when Indy swings on a lamp with his whip). Timed explosives were used for a scene where Indiana drives a truck through crates. During the take, an explosive failed to detonate and landed in the seat beside Ford. It did not go off and he was not injured.|$|E

5|$|The First Ostend Raid on 23 April 1918 {{was largely}} a failure, the blockships {{grounded}} {{too far from the}} channels to obstruct them. The second attempt also failed, due to heavy German resistance and British navigational difficulties in poor weather. In anticipation of a raid, the Germans had removed the navigation buoys and without them the British had difficulty finding the narrow channel into the harbour in poor weather. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> discover the entrance, German resistance proved too strong for the operation to be completed as originally planned: the obsolete cruiser HMS Vindictive was sunk, but only partially blocked the channel.|$|E
5|$|Great auks {{walked slowly}} and {{sometimes}} used their wings {{to help them}} traverse rough terrain. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> run, it was awkwardly and with short steps in a straight line. They had few natural predators, mainly large marine mammals, such as the orca and white-tailed eagles. Polar bears preyed on nesting colonies of the great auk. Reportedly, this species had no innate fear of human beings, and their flightlessness and awkwardness on land compounded their vulnerability. Humans preyed upon them as food, for feathers, and as specimens for museums and private collections. Great auks reacted to noises, but were rarely frightened {{by the sight of}} something. They used their bills aggressively both in the dense nesting sites and when threatened or captured by humans. These birds are believed to have had a life span of approximately 20 to 25 years. During the winter, the great auk migrated south, either in pairs or in small groups, but never with the entire nesting colony.|$|E
5|$|Humiliated by the revolt, naval {{officers}} {{and the president of}} Brazil were staunchly opposed to amnesty, so they quickly began planning to assault the rebel ships. The former believed such an action was necessary to restore the service's honor. Late on the 24th, the President ordered the naval officers to attack the mutineers. Officers crewed some smaller warships and the cruiser , Bahias sister ship with ten 4.7-inch guns. They planned to attack {{on the morning of the}} 25th, when the government expected the mutineers would return to Guanabara Bay. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not return and the amnesty measure neared passage in the Chamber of Deputies, the order was rescinded.

5|$|Humiliated by the revolt, naval {{officers}} {{and the president of}} Brazil were staunchly opposed to amnesty, so they quickly began planning to assault the rebel ships. The officers believed such an action was necessary to restore the service's honor. The rebels, believing an attack was imminent, sailed their ships out of Guanabara Bay and spent the night of 23–24 November at sea, only returning during daylight. Late on the 24th, the President ordered the naval officers to attack the mutineers. Officers crewed some smaller warships and the cruiser , Bahias sister ship with ten 4.7-inch guns.

5|$|In 1804, Clarkson {{resumed his}} work and the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade began meeting again, {{strengthened}} with prominent new members such as Zachary Macaulay, Henry Brougham and James Stephen. In June 1804, Wilberforce's bill to abolish the slave trade successfully passed all its stages through the House of Commons. However, {{it was too late}} in the parliamentary session for it to complete its passage through the House of Lords. On its reintroduction during the 1805 session, it was defeated, with even the usually sympathetic Pitt failing to support it. On this occasion and throughout the campaign, abolition was held back by Wilberforce's trusting, even credulous nature, and his deferential attitude towards those in power. He found it difficult to believe that men of rank would not do what he perceived to be the right thing, and was reluctant to confront them <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not.|$|E
5|$|In November 1882, he {{left the}} Inconstant, spent Christmas in Darmstadt, and in March the {{following}} year visited his younger brother, Prince Alexander, in Bulgaria. Alexander had been made Sovereign Prince of Bulgaria in 1879 {{with the approval of}} Europe's Great Powers. Louis accompanied his brother on a state visit to Turkey, and then on a tour of Cyprus and the Holy Land with the Turkish navy, during which Louis was appalled at the lack of seamanship—the Turkish captains were unable to navigate and had to hug the coast so as not to get lost; <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> leave the coast they became so disoriented that they were unable to steer for Jaffa. On its return journey the ship on which they had travelled ran aground.|$|E

5|$|John Tyler Jr. (March 29, 1790 – January 18, 1862) {{served as}} the tenth President of the United States (1841–45) after briefly being the tenth Vice President (1841); {{he was elected to}} the latter office on the 1840 Whig ticket with President William Henry Harrison. Tyler ascended to the {{presidency}} after Harrison's death in April 1841, a mere month after the start of the new administration. He was a supporter of states' rights, and as president he adopted nationalist policies only <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not infringe on the powers of the states. His unexpected rise to the presidency, with the resulting threat to the presidential ambitions of Henry Clay and other politicians, left him estranged from both major political parties.|$|E
5|$|Landscape was a {{secondary}} concern to Netherlandish painters before the mid 1460s. Geographical settings were rare and <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> appear usually consisted of glimpses through open windows or arcades. They were rarely based on actual locations; the settings {{tended to be}} largely imagined, designed to suit the thematic thrust of the panel. Because most of the works were donor portraits, very often the landscapes were tame, controlled and served merely to provide a harmonious setting for the idealised interior space. In this, the northern artists lagged behind their Italian counterparts who were already placing their sitters within geographically identifiable and closely described landscapes. Some of the northern landscapes are highly detailed and notable in their own right, including van Eyck's unsentimental c.1430 Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych and van der Weyden's widely copied 1435–40 Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{started when}} the Illyrian {{troops on the}} Macedonian right wing {{attacked}} the Spartan force on Evas. The Spartan light infantry and cavalry, noticing that the Achaean infantry was not protected at the rear, launched {{an assault on the}} back of the Macedonian right wing, and threatened to rout it. However, at the critical moment, Philopoemon of Megalopolis (who later became one of the greatest heroes of the Achaean League, eventually conquering Sparta), tried to point out the danger to the senior cavalry commanders. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not take notice of him, Philopoemon gathered a few other cavalrymen and charged the Spartan cavalry. The Spartans attacking from the rear broke off their engagement with the enemy, which encouraged the Macedonians to charge at the Spartan positions. The Spartans' left flank was eventually forced back and thrown from their position and their commander, Eucleidas, killed; they fled the field.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the game, {{the player}} roams Pacific City, {{systematically}} eliminating the leaders and subordinates {{of the three}} gangs. Upon defeating the gangs' Kingpins and generals, the Agent must put down a final riot by the remaining gang members in the area which after completion will cause that city to be almost crime free. Once all three gangs are fully exterminated, in the closing cutscene of the game, the Director reveals to the Agent {{that there was an}} ulterior motive for the Agency's actions: the Agency had secretly empowered the three gangs in the first place to instill fear in Pacific City's residents, thus creating a need for the Agency to control the city, and acceptance in the populace <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> take over. The Agency Director's comments suggest that the Agency will replicate this plan in other cities across the globe to create a New World Order.|$|E
5|$|Combined {{with the}} Domesday Survey, the Pipe rolls {{contributed to the}} {{centralisation}} of financial records by the Norman kings (reigned 1066–1154) of England that was ahead of contemporary Western European monarchies; the French, for instance, {{did not have an}} equivalent system of accounting until the 1190s. The exact form of the records, kept in a roll instead of a book, was also unique to England, although why England kept some of its administrative records in this form is unclear. A set of Norman rolls, drafted differently, are extant in a few years for the reigns of Kings Henry II (reigned 1154–1189) and Richard I (reigned 1189–1199), who also ruled the Duchy of Normandy in France. It is believed that the Norman rolls were started {{about the same time as}} the English, but due to lack of survival of the earlier Norman rolls, it is unclear exactly <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> start. An Irish Exchequer produced Irish Pipe rolls, and much like the English Pipe rolls, the earliest surviving Irish Pipe roll, that of 1212, does not appear to be the first produced.|$|E
5|$|Dowding saw 12 Group as the {{protector}} of the Midlands and a reserve for 11 Group. Mallory and Bader wanted to ignore both the defence of the Midlands and keeping a reserve in order to commit 12 Group to battle. In essence, they proposed the opposite of Dowding and resolved to commit the reserves before the front-line units. While this method might have spared 11 Group, it had its problems. Although Mallory and Bader wanted to stop the enemy before it hit RAF airfields, {{the amount of time}} it took to position large formations for interception meant that the Big Wing often failed to achieve this. Instead, they engaged the enemy as he withdrew. Prompted by a supporting comment from Leigh-Mallory, to the effect that it did not matter when an interception was made, as long as it accounted for a large number of enemy aircraft, Bader announced that he would rather destroy 50 German bombers after hitting their targets than 10 before. The argument was strong; crippling losses would act as a deterrent, so that damage sustained on an occasion when the Germans did get through would have to be offset against later occasions <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not even care to try.|$|E
