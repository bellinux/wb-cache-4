By using a stratagem, Toungoo armies took Pegu without firing a shot. A few weeks later, Hanthawaddy's larger but poorly-led forces were decisively defeated at the Battle of Naungyo by light forces of Gen. Kyawhtin Nawrahta (Bayinnaung). Only a decimated Hanthawaddy force made it to Prome.|$|E

The motorcycle was a Vincent Black Shadow, registration 750 UXL (1952), the car was a Jaguar XK120, registration SKE 7 (1954). According to the show, the XK120 and Black Shadow were the fastest car and bike in the world in 1949. Although Tornado is a brand new locomotive completed in 2008, her design was based on the original 1940s designs used for the LNER Peppercorn Class A1 locomotives, with appropriate modern day changes for engineering, safety, operational and manufacturing cost reasons.|$|E
25|$|The Pharisees were a {{powerful}} force in 1st-century Judea. Early Christians shared several beliefs of the Pharisees, such as resurrection, retribution in the next world, angels, human freedom, and Divine Providence. After {{the fall of the}} Temple, the Pharisaic outlook was established in Rabbinic Judaism. Some scholars speculate that Jesus was himself a Pharisee. In Jesus' day, the two main schools of thought among the Pharisees were the House of Hillel, which had been founded by the eminent Tanna, Hillel the Elder, and the House of Shammai. Jesus' assertion of hypocrisy may have been directed against the stricter members of the House of Shammai, although he agreed with their teachings on divorce. Jesus also commented on the House of Hillel's teachings (Babylonian Talmud, Shabbat 31a) concerning the greatest commandment and the Golden Rule. Historians do not know whether there were Pharisees in Galilee during Jesus' life, or what they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>like.</b>|$|E

500|$|As {{the tour}} {{drew to a}} close, U2 entered {{prolonged}} discussions about creating a Zoo TV television channel in partnership with MTV. This never materialised, but in 1997, MTV ran a brief miniseries called Zoo-TV, which featured Emergency Broadcast Network extending their tour role in creating contemporary surrealist satirical video. U2 endorsed the effort as a representation of what the tour <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>like</b> as a news magazine, but their direct role was limited to providing half-financing and outtakes from the Zooropa album. Wired magazine said the series [...] "pushe the edge of commercial—even comprehensible—television".|$|E
500|$|... "Never Again" [...] {{was written}} by Glen Morgan and James Wong, and {{directed}} by Rob Bowman. The episode was the final episode that Morgan or Wong would write until the tenth season, as they took over as executive producers for the series' sister show Millennium shortly after. The initial story the two developed was a “sort of Abraham Lincoln’s ghost in the White House type of thing”. Both writers had desired {{to write a story}} wherein Lincoln's ghost haunts the White House and Mulder and Scully investigate. Morgan explained that he had [...] "done a lot of research and I had always wanted to write a feature about Lincoln’s ghost". However, due to the massive amounts of rewrites the two were forced to do for [...] "Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man", both Morgan and Wong lost interest in the story. Morgan explained, [...] "I felt they didn’t want my heart and soul anymore, so I wouldn’t give this one to them". The two later crafted [...] "Never Again" [...] in its place. Years later, Frank Spotnitz said that he [...] "always wondered about" [...] the story and what the finished product <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>like.</b>|$|E
500|$|Commentators cited Jennifer Aniston's {{appearance}} as {{the highlight of}} the episode. Entertainment Weekly Annie Barrett lauded the interactions between Aniston and Cox; [...] "Their interactions were along the lines of what I imagine it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>like</b> if Rachel's character had suddenly decided she had become a wizard." [...] Kevin Fallon of The Atlantic echoed synonymous thoughts, and felt that Aniston's performance reminded the audience of her star power. Fallon wrote: [...] "Aniston's performance was delightfully weird and offbeat—and comedically sharp, a welcome change from the generic and bland film roles she's played in the years since Friends ended. Last night's performance spotlighted her gifts as a character actress—and served as a frustrating reminder of what we've been missing since she has [...] abandoned that niche of acting." [...] Sepinwall expressed that Aniston [...] "acquits herself just fine in the small role of Jules' eccentric new therapist. She's likable and daffy but never over-the-top." [...] Hollywood Life journalist Laura Schreffler was not as enthusiastic as the general consensus, avouching that Aniston's guest appearance was overhyped and a [...] "glorified cameo". Schreffler added that Cox overshadowed her, asserting that she [...] "is still way more hilarious".|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} moderately positive {{reviews from}} critics. Travis Fickett from IGN retroactively gave the episode a 7.5 out of 10, signifying a [...] "good" [...] episode. Fickett commented that [...] "Basketball" [...] was stylistically different {{from most of}} the other episodes in the fledgling series, pointing to its lack of a sub-plot and its characterization of Michael Scott. Fickett, when discussing the latter, singled out the moment wherein Michael hurts Phyllis' feelings by telling her she can't play basketball, writing, [...] "The moment is played mostly straight–and it does feel more realistic and uncomfortable and in that way, the show leans more towards the feel of the UK series. It's a great moment, but feels like a different show." [...] Overall, he wrote that, [...] "There is still quite a bit of funny stuff , but in many ways, this episode suggests what the show <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>like</b> had it taken a slightly different direction in terms of tone and style." [...] Miss Alli from Television Without Pity gave the episode an [...] "A–". Jenna Mullins from E! News referred to [...] "Basketball" [...] as her [...] "all-time favorite episode of The Office" [...] in an article about Steve Carell's last episode of the series.|$|E
500|$|When Homer {{is chosen}} by the Republicans to pick their {{candidate}} for the next presidential election, his {{lack of interest in}} the current candidates leads him to choose Ted Nugent. He invites Nugent for a visit to the Simpsons' home, where Lisa complains that Homer has made the wrong pick since Nugent is [...] "out of his mind". Later that day, Homer has a dream in which James Madison shows him how ashamed past American presidents are of Homer. When he wakes up, he tells Lisa he will not be supporting Nugent for president anymore. He then sees a brochure on her dresser with a man posing as a president and offering help with fake dreams. Homer realizes the family faked his dream to convince him not to endorse Nugent. As a result, he angrily decides to go on television and express his support for Nugent. However, when he tries to bring out his ability to cry every time he discusses anything on television, he finds he cannot bring up those emotions because he does not truly believe in what he is saying. Homer [...] announces on television that he [...] "is full of crap" [...] and [...] reconciles with Lisa. As a result, Nugent is stripped of his position as the Republican presidential candidate. The episode ends as he sings a song about what his presidency <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>like.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} saw {{the season}} as [...] "two shows"; Wyman noted, [...] "It's on us to make the mythology over there just as compelling as the mythology here, so we will enjoy both of them. We have our characters going back and forth, there or here, but there's {{a whole set of}} nice characters that you'll become very interested in very quickly. It's interesting because it gives you that gearshift." [...] Wyman later added that parallel universe plot device [...] "really allowed us to explore the characters deeper via their doppelgängers, to illuminate characters we already know. It’s been a real gas for all of us involved in making the show." [...] Historical idiosyncrasies were inserted into the parallel universe, such as a still-living John F. Kennedy, the non-existence of the FBI, and the Back to the Future franchise starring Eric Stoltz rather than Michael J. Fox. The writers loved creating an entire new world, and asked themselves what life <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>like</b> in its most mundane forms, such as within daily routines. Pinkner thought it allowed them to create and explore many [...] "what-if" [...] moments, such as if the September 11 attacks had occurred against the White House instead of the Twin Towers, or if the Statue of Liberty still possessed its shiny copper sheen. [...] "Entrada", the eighth episode, {{was the first of the}} season to divide its time between both universes.|$|E

500|$|When {{discussing}} the many {{differences between the}} prime and parallel universes in an interview, Pinkner explained that [...] "one of the big themes {{of the show is}} how small choices that you make define you as a person and can change your life in large ways down the line". Pinkner {{and the rest of the}} Fringe production team loved the opportunity to build an entire new world, and asked themselves what life <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>like</b> in its most mundane forms, such as within daily routines. Pinkner thought it allowed them to create and explore many [...] "what-if" [...] moments, such as if the September 11 attacks had occurred against the White House instead of the Twin Towers, or if the Statue of Liberty still possessed its shiny copper sheen. Pinkner elaborated in another interview that when the [...] "perfectionist" [...] crew were writing and constructing the parallel universe, they spent a lot of time on a high [...] "level of attention and detail" [...] that had all of the different departments and actors weighing in. Pinkner thought that because the parallel universe is effectively breaking down with [...] "World War II"-like conditions, these [...] "sort of tough times forge more noble, stronger people". To better differentiate the two universes, the producers changed the color of the opening credit sequences by making the parallel universe red and the prime universe blue. As with the opening credits in [...] "Peter", the episodes featuring the parallel universe displayed certain fringe science words in that world, including wormholes, speciation, pandemics, and telepathy.|$|E
500|$|In January1994, Simon co-created with comedian George Carlin {{the sitcom}} The George Carlin Show for Fox. It aired for 27 episodes before being {{canceled}} in December1995. Simon served as showrunner throughout its run and directed several episodes. Simon persuaded Carlin {{to do the}} show after writing it as something which would not be [...] "typically sitcomy." [...] He conceived the show as what Carlin's life <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>like</b> had he never become a comedian; Carlin played a heavy drinking New York taxi driver. Simon commented: [...] "When I was doing The Simpsons, people couldn't see how smart {{it was because of}} the low moments. There's something about this show. People who like it say it's classy. They don't see how vulgar it is." [...] Carlin wrote negatively of his relationship with Simon. On his own website, Carlin wrote of the show: [...] "always check mental health of creative partner beforehand. Loved the actors, loved the crew. Had a great time. Couldn't wait to get the fuck out of there." [...] In his final book, the posthumously published Last Words (2009), Carlin elaborated: [...] "I had a great time. I never laughed so much, so often, so hard as I did with cast members Alex Rocco, Chris Rich, Tony Starke. There was a very strange, very good sense of humor on that stage ... The biggest problem, though, was that Sam Simon was a fucking horrible person to be around. Very, very funny, extremely bright and brilliant, but an unhappy person who treated other people poorly."
