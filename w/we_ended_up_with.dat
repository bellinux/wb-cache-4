500|$|In the band, Joseph {{covered a}} lot of the {{keyboard}} parts that Yanni could not for lack of hands in the shows. He assisted with the task of managing the 30 or more synthesizers onstage, and helped layer with the orchestra to create a [...] "full-bodied, live-effect sound". [...] He did have to adjust some parts that did not work well in a live situation and worked extensively on programming sounds for all keyboardists. [...] Joseph said that [...] "Yanni gave us musicians a great deal of freedom to expand the music as well. If you listen to the original recordings he did and what <b>we</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> in our live recordings, you can really hear the musician's input." [...] He readily credits Yanni's role in his professional development, and for five years of irreplaceable experiences and memories.|$|E
500|$|The other {{material}} on Eat a Peach comes from live recordings. Dowd later said, [...] "When we recorded At Fillmore East, <b>we</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> almost {{a whole other}} album's worth of good material, and we used [...] tracks on Eat a Peach. Again, there was no overdubbing". Dowd started the mixing process for Eat a Peach but had run overtime and was called to commitments with Crosby, Stills and Nash; longtime Allman friend and colleague Johnny Sandlin took over for the remaining mixes. Sandlin later said of the mixing process, [...] "As I mixed songs like [...] "Blue Sky," [...] I knew, of course, that I {{was listening to the}} last things that Duane ever played and there was just such a mix of beauty and sadness, knowing there's {{not going to be any}} more from him". He was particularly proud of his mixing work on the album, but was angry because he did not receive credit, only a [...] "special thanks." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{earliest}} {{incarnation of}} [...] "Stay (Faraway, So Close!)" [...] was {{developed during the}} recording sessions for Achtung Baby. While working in Hansa Ton Studios in Berlin, guitarist The Edge and lead singer Bono created the verse. The track was given the working title [...] "Sinatra" [...] {{in reference to the}} artist whose music inspired it. The group reworked it in preparation of Zooropa. The Edge noted [...] "it came to us in installments". Bassist Adam Clayton said [...] "it was hard to figure out how we would do it. I mean, {{no one is going to}} mistake us for Frank Sinatra's backing band. A very humble little combo sound is what <b>we</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> and that really worked." [...] The Edge added [...] "I was playing around on piano with some old-school chord progressions trying to summon up the spirit of Frank Sinatra. It's definitely not from a rock and roll tradition." [...] He worked out a chord progression based on old Tin Pan Alley songs.|$|E
500|$|Tim Miller, {{creative}} {{director for the}} title sequence, wanted to develop an abstract narrative that reflected the pivotal moments in the novel, {{as well as the}} character development of Lisbeth Salander. It was arduous for Miller to conceptualize the sequence abstractly, given that Salander's occupation was a distinctive part of her personality. His initial ideas were modeled after a keyboard. [...] "We were going to treat the keyboard like this giant city with massive fingers pressing down on the keys," [...] Miller explained, [...] "Then we transitioned to the liquid going through the giant obelisks of the keys." [...] Among Miller's many vignettes was [...] "The Hacker Inside", which revealed the character's inner disposition and melted them away. The futuristic qualities in the original designs provided for a much more cyberpunk appearance than the final product. In creating the [...] "cyber" [...] look for Salander, Miller said, [...] "Every time I would show David a design he would say, 'More Tandy!' It's the shitty little computers from Radio Shack, the Tandy computers. They probably had vacuum tubes in them, really old technology. And David would go 'More Tandy', until <b>we</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> something that looked like we glued a bunch of computer parts found at a junkyard together." ...|$|E
500|$|An {{even more}} visible {{holdover}} was the 'signs' segment. [...] This would begin when Springsteen collected request signs from the pit audience as an extended introduction to [...] "Raise Your Hand" [...] was played. [...] Once that song completed, Springsteen selected {{two or three}} numbers to play from the requests. [...] The first was often a garage rock classic such as [...] "Wild Thing", [...] "96 Tears", or [...] "Mony Mony" [...] or a punk rock staple such as [...] "I Wanna Be Sedated" [...] or [...] "London Calling". [...] This activity was billed as [...] "Stump the Band", and led to impromptu arrangements being worked out onstage. [...] Springsteen would sometimes taunt the audience afterwards with declarations that the E Street Band could not be stumped, such as saying in Atlanta's Philips Arena, [...] "...this is the greatest bar band in the land, and if they don't think we know 96 fuckin' Tears!" [...] The immediate introduction of the signs segment surprised even E Street guitarist Nils Lofgren, who thought Springsteen would hold it off until later in the tour. [...] The precise degree of challenge in this segment was unclear, as lyrics were often loaded into the teleprompter that Springsteen uses {{and in some cases}} the songs had been soundchecked earlier. [...] In any case, most of the challenges were to the band's shared knowledge of British Invasion, Motown, Stax-Volt, and other 1960s material. [...] Springsteen subsequently said, [...] "we started to take unusual requests and do songs that we'd never played before, just depending on the common memory that the band would have from everyone's individual playing experience as teenagers. <b>We</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a system where we can jump on a lot pretty quick." [...] Other honored sign requests were usually for Springsteen songs not normally in the set list.|$|E

500|$|... 343 {{started with}} a staff of roughly a dozen people, but grew to nearly 200 through {{development}}. Halo 4s development team included former employees of more than 25 triple-A studios. Prospective employees could not be told {{they were going to be}} working on Halo 4. [...] "We had people who we hired who hated Halo because of 'X,'" [...] said Frank O'Connor, 343 Industries' franchise development director. [...] "But what that really meant was, 'I feel like this game could be awesome because of 'Y input' that I'm going to bring into it. I want to prove it, and I'm passionate about proving it.' So <b>we</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a bunch of people who were genuinely passionate about the product. That is a huge advantage, and that helped in hiring and forming our team." [...] This rapid hiring and growth occurred during development of the game, creating issues; because the team was committed to a delivery date, Halo 4 executive producer Kiki Wolfkill said that the team was forced to make [...] "necessary mistakes", with production difficulties and a team inexperienced with working together contributing to development difficulties. Nine months before shipping, the developers restructured the game's production pipeline and gave individual teams more control due to bottlenecks in development. [...] With so many developers from different backgrounds, forging a common goal and company culture was different. Creative director Josh Holmes recalled that an [...] "epiphany moment" [...] that proved the team was headed in the right direction was early in development, when the team completed a section of the game that was [...] "very traditional [...] ". Despite positive feedback from testers, 343 Industries discarded the prototype as too traditional, but felt that it showed the team could work together.|$|E

[...] In 2009, GamePro listed Kung Lao's hat as the ninth best piece of headwear in gaming. His [...] "Bunny Beatdown" [...] from the same game was ranked as the 43rd craziest finishing move in the gaming by Complex.com in 2010, while the hat slice was ranked fifth. That same year, Kung Lao's hat splice Fatality ranked as 35th most gruesome finishing move ever by UGO.com. Mortal Kombat co-creator Ed Boon commented that Kung Lao's MK2011 'buzzsaw-on-the-ground' was [...] "probably the most painful-looking Fatality ever made;" [...] it was included by FHM on their list of nine most brutal Fatalities in the game. In 2012, Cheat Code Central's Shelby Reiches included the [...] "Jewel Splitter" [...] Fatality among the four worst cinematic scenes in games, commenting: [...] "Every time he does this to a male fighter, I can hardly watch.
