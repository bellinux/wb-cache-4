The dwarves, men and elves band together, but only with the timely arrival of the eagles and Beorn do they win the climactic Battle of Five Armies. Thorin is fatally wounded and reconciles with Bilbo before he dies. Bilbo accepts {{only a small portion}} of his share of the treasure, having no <b>want</b> <b>or</b> need for more, but still returns home a very wealthy hobbit.|$|E
5|$|The Shakespeare authorship {{question}} is the argument that someone other than William Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon wrote the works attributed to him. Anti-Stratfordians—a collective term for adherents of the various alternative-authorship theories—believe that Shakespeare of Stratford was a front to shield {{the identity of the}} real author or authors, who for some reason did not <b>want</b> <b>or</b> could not accept public credit. Although the idea has attracted much public interest, all but a few Shakespeare scholars and literary historians consider it a fringe belief and, for the most part, acknowledge it only to rebut or disparage the claims.|$|E
25|$|The United Nations International Bioethics Committee {{wrote that}} liberal {{eugenics}} {{should not be}} confused with the ethical problems of the 20th century eugenics movements. However that it is still problematic because it challenges the idea of human equality and opens up new ways of discrimination and stigmatization against those who do not <b>want</b> <b>or</b> cannot afford the enhancements.|$|E

25|$|The {{person who}} is acting in a {{controlling}} way often wants something from the other person that is legitimate to want. They may want to feel loved, safe, valuable, appreciated, supported, needed, etc. This is not the problem. The problem is often {{more a matter of}} how they are going about getting what they <b>want,</b> <b>or</b> that they are insensitive to others needs in doing so that is troubling—and how others react to all of this.|$|E
25|$|When {{he reached}} the age of 16, his father reputedly {{arranged}} his marriage to a cousin of the same age named Yaśodharā (Pāli: Yasodharā). According to the traditional account, she gave birth to a son, named Rāhula. Siddhartha is said to have spent 29 years as a prince in Kapilavastu. Although his father ensured that Siddhartha was provided with everything he could <b>want</b> <b>or</b> need, Buddhist scriptures say that the future Buddha felt that material wealth was not life's ultimate goal.|$|E

Field experiments show that prospective person memory is often quite poor.|$|R
25|$|The {{built-in}} ROM-resident BBC BASIC {{programming language}} interpreter realised the system's educational emphasis and was key to its success; {{not only was}} it the most comprehensive BASIC compared to other contemporary implementations but it ran very efficiently and was therefore fast. Advanced programs could be written without resorting to non-structured programming or machine code (necessary with many competing computers). Should one <b>want</b> <b>or</b> need to do some assembly programming, BBC BASIC featured a built-in assembler that allowed a very easy mixture of BBC BASIC and assembler for whatever processor BBC BASIC was operating on.|$|E

The new systems let the rovers decide whether or not to transmit an image, and whether or not to extend their arms to examine rocks, which would save much time for scientists as they would not have to sift through hundreds of images to find the one they <b>want,</b> <b>or</b> examine the surroundings to decide to extend the arms and examine the rocks.|$|E
25|$|Many {{artists are}} using the Internet to give away music to create {{awareness}} and liking to a new upcoming album. The artists release a new song {{on the internet for}} free download, which consumers can download. The hope is to have the listeners buy the new album because of the free download. A common practice used today is releasing a song or two on the internet for consumers to indulge. In 2007, Radiohead released an album named in Rainbows, in which fans could pay any amount they <b>want,</b> <b>or</b> download it for free.|$|E

25|$|The Muslim Alliance for Sexual and Gender Diversity (MASGD) in the United States {{began on}} January 23, 2013. It supports, {{empowers}} and connects LGBTQ Muslims. It aims “to increase {{the acceptance of}} gender and sexual diversity within Muslim communities.” On June 20, 2016, an interview with Mirna Haidar (a member of the MASGD’s steering committee) was published in The Washington Post. She described the MASGD as supporting “LGBT Muslims who <b>want</b> <b>or</b> need to embrace both their sexual and religious identities.” Haidar said that the support the MASGD provides is needed because {{a person who is}} “Muslim and queer “ faces “two different systems of oppression”: Islamophobia and homophobia.|$|E
25|$|Black Kettle and his wife, Medicine Woman, {{were shot}} in the back and killed while fleeing on a pony. Following the capture of Black Kettle's village, Custer found himself in a {{precarious}} position. As the fighting began to subside, he saw large groups of mounted Indians gathering on nearby hilltops and learned that Black Kettle's village was only one of many Indian encampments along the river. Fearing an attack, he ordered some of his men to take defensive positions while the others were to seize the Indians' belongings and horses. They destroyed what they did not <b>want</b> <b>or</b> could not carry, including about 675 ponies and horses. They spared 200 horses to carry prisoners.|$|E
25|$|Children with {{persistent}} GID {{are characterized}} by more extreme gender dysphoria in childhood than children with desisting gender dysphoria. Some (but not all) gender diverse / gender independent / gender fluid youth will <b>want</b> <b>or</b> need to transition, which may involve social transition (changing dress, name, pronoun), and, for older youth and adolescents, medical transition (hormonal and surgical intervention). Treatment may {{take the form of}} puberty blockers such as Lupron Depot or Leuprolide Acetate, or cross-sex hormones (i.e., administering estrogen to an assigned male at birth or testosterone to an assigned female at birth), or surgery (i.e., mastectomies, salphingo-oophorectomies/hysterectomy, the creation of a neophallus in female-to-male transsexuals, orchiectomies, breast augmentation, facial feminization surgery, the creation of a neovagina in male-to-female transsexuals), with the aim of bringing one’s physical body in line with their felt gender. The ability to transition (socially and medically) are sometimes needed in the treatment of gender dysphoria.|$|E

25|$|Obtaining a Social Security {{number for}} a child is voluntary. Further, there is no general legal {{requirement}} that individuals join the Social Security program unless they <b>want</b> <b>or</b> have to work. Under normal circumstances, FICA taxes or SECA taxes will be collected on all wages. About {{the only way to}} avoid paying either FICA or SECA taxes are to join a religion that does not believe in insurance, such as the Amish, Christian Science or a religion whose members have taken a vow of poverty (see IRS publication 517 and 4361). Federal workers employed before 1987, various state and local workers including those in some school districts who had their own retirement and disability programs were given the one-time option of joining Social Security. Many employees and retirement and disability systems opted to keep out of the Social Security system because of the cost and the limited benefits. It was often much cheaper to obtain much higher retirement and disability benefits by staying in their original retirement and disability plans. Now only a few of these plans allow new hires to join their existing plans without also joining Social Security. In 2004, the Social Security Administration estimated that 96% of all U.S. workers were covered by the system with the remaining 4% mostly a minority of government employees enrolled in public employee pensions and not subject to Social Security taxes due to historical exemptions.|$|E
500|$|The word thelema is the English {{transliteration}} of the Koine Greek noun θέλημα (pronounced [...] ) [...] "will", {{from the}} verb [...] "to will, wish, <b>want</b> <b>or</b> purpose." [...] As Crowley developed the religion, he wrote widely on the topic, {{as well as}} producing more 'inspired' writing that he collectively termed The Holy Books of Thelema. He also included ideas from occultism, yoga, and both Eastern and Western mysticism, especially the Qabalah.|$|E

500|$|Though Cochrane {{argues that}} nonhuman animals {{are not the}} victim of an {{injustice}} {{simply because they are}} owned, he claims that ownership of an animal must be understood as not entailing absolute control over said animal. He conceptualises owned animals as [...] "individual sentient creatures with interests of their own". In understanding owned animals in this way, he challenges alternative accounts that frame owned animals variously as living artifacts, slaves, co-citizens or beings who have strategically situated themselves alongside humans. In Animal Rights Without Liberation, Cochrane argues that there is nothing intrinsically wrong with using or owning animals, and so, as long as their interests are respected, there is nothing intrinsically wrong with using them, for example, in scientific tests, or for agricultural purposes. Ahlhaus and Niesen characterise the book as a whole as a critique of Singer's Animal Liberation, saying that the former explores the latter's [...] "undeclared premise that liberation is what animals <b>want</b> <b>or</b> need".|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Popular Mechanics named The Truman Show {{as one of}} the 10 most prophetic {{science fiction}} films. Journalist Erik Sofge argued that the story {{reflects}} the falseness of reality television. [...] "Truman simply lives, and the show's popularity is its straightforward voyeurism. And, like Big Brother, Survivor, and every other reality show on the air, none of his environment is actually real." [...] He deemed it an eerie coincidence that Big Brother made its debut a year after the film's release, and he also compared the film to the 2003 program The Joe Schmo Show: [...] "Unlike Truman, Matt Gould could see the cameras, but all of the other contestants were paid actors, playing the part of various reality-show stereotypes. While Matt eventually got all of the prizes in the rigged contest, the show's central running joke was in the same existential ballpark as The Truman Show." [...] Weir declared, [...] "There has always been this question: Is the audience getting dumber? Or are we filmmakers patronizing them? Is this what they <b>want?</b> <b>Or</b> is this what we're giving them? But the public went to my film in large numbers. And that has to be encouraging." ...|$|E
500|$|Japan employs both analog {{and digital}} broadcasting, but by July 2011 all {{television}} broadcasting {{is to be}} digital. Tokyo Tower is not a reliable broadcasting antenna for completely digital broadcasting because the tower is not tall enough to transmit the higher frequency waves to areas surrounded by forests or high-rise buildings. As an alternative, a new 634-metre-tall (2,080ft) tower called the Tokyo Skytree was opened in 2012. To make Tokyo Tower more appealing to NHK and five other commercial broadcasters who plan to move their transmitting stations to the new tower, Nihon Denpatō officials drafted a plan to extend its digital broadcasting antenna by 80to100metres {{at a cost of}} approximately ¥4billion (US$50 million). Because these plans have not been realized, Tokyo Tower is expected to stop transmitting digital TV radio waves with the exception of Open University of Japan, who will continue to broadcast through the tower. FM radio stations will also continue to use the tower for broadcasting in the Tokyo area. Masahiro Kawada, the tower's planning director, also pointed out the possibility of the tower becoming a backup for the Tokyo Skytree, depending on what the TV broadcasters <b>want</b> <b>or</b> need.|$|E
