For <b>workers</b> who completed <b>college,</b> the rate of unemployment and the incidence of “low quality” jobs are lower than for less skilled workers. On the other hand, the article presents an estimation of the wage premium of college and more specifically, of the premium in occupations where we can find <b>workers</b> with <b>college</b> and with high-school. The main conclusion is that there is a premium for <b>workers</b> who finished <b>college</b> but the results are not clear for workers who studied some years of college but did not graduate.

By taking a closer look at each of these groups, one can begin to understand better the new challenges China is facing in this transition toward a neoclassical labor market.|$|E

30|$|In {{this paper}} we {{highlight}} key employment issues in China by looking closely at three distinct groups: migrant <b>workers,</b> <b>college</b> graduates, {{and the urban}} working vulnerable. Each of these groups faces {{its own set of}} employment-related difficulties. Migrant workers are prone to be affected by cyclical unemployment because when the urban labor markets tighten due to economic slowdowns, many of them end up returning to agriculture work, which is a form of underemployment. College graduates are most vulnerable to structural and frictional unemployment, which partly explains why unemployment rates are often higher among this group than among some other groups. Thirdly, the vulnerability of vulnerable workers in urban areas is due largely to inadequate education and skill, a situation for which there are deep historical reasons.|$|E
40|$|Abstract__ Globally, HIV {{transmission}} dominantly occurs through unprotected sexual acts. Although China has not {{yet what}} many would consider a widespread AIDS epidemic, the incidence rate of HIV infection has risen sharply over the past decade. To be able to effectively reduce incidence, {{it is important to}} achieve radical behavioral changes – both between individuals and across large groups of people at-risk. China knows a number of risk population groups for HIV infection, namely conventional high risk population groups (For examples: sex workers and {{men who have sex with}} men) and general population groups who are at risk yet have been less concerned in HIV prevention. In this thesis, we describe a number of studies on the identification of risk factors and determinants of HIV-related behaviors among several high risk yet neglected general population groups, including health care <b>workers,</b> <b>college</b> students and general internal migrants, in China. We also explore the elements bridging these determinants into effective and practical HIV prevention interventions. Our aim was to contribute to the development of effective preventive measures against HIV infections in the neglected high risk populations...|$|E

This framework is also used to show that skill-biased technological change will lead to a decline in the proportion of <b>college</b> <b>workers</b> in noncollege jobs.

40|$|This {{presentation}} clarifies Japanese writers’ {{tendency of}} written {{statement from the}} textorganization and writing-attitude. The result of investigation {{is the same as}} the presenter's hypothesis, that is, Japanese writers try to approach the point of argument by a roundabout way of developing a paragraph. 55 % of the examinees showed this tendency. The fact that Japanese technical writers are willing to go along with the policy of the native speakers of English was also revealed through the interview and obtaining information by means of questionnaires. THE PURPOSE This presentation aims at revealing how Japanese culture and behavior influence the writing style of technical documents. The presenter thinks that technical documents are much influenced by the thought patterns and behavior of the writer, particularly by culturally influenced patterns of thinking. Therefore, the presenter tries to clarify the stylistic features appearing in the documents written by Japanese writers including office <b>workers,</b> <b>college</b> teachers and technical writers, and illustrates the relations between the writing styles and the behavior of the writers.
