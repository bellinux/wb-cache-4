If two teams vying for a third Climax Series spot finish the regular season with identical records, the team that finished the previous season with a better record is allowed {{to advance to the}} playoffs, unless if both teams finished with the same previous season record. The First Stage is a best-of-three series involving the regular season's second- and third-place finishers, with all games played at the second-place team's home field. The winner of this series goes on to face the league's pennant-winner in the Final Stage. This series is best-of-six. The league champion is awarded a one-win advantage as well as home field advantage for the entire series, unlike most professional leagues where a 5-game playoff series runs 2-2-1 or 2-3 or a 7-game playoff series that runs 2-3-2 with the higher seed receiving the extra game. The winning teams advance to the Japan Series, where they compete against one another. Unlike MLB, NPB games may end in a tie if there is no winner after 12innings of play. If a Climax Series game results in a tie, the <b>win</b> <b>is</b> credited to neither team. If this causes the series to end in a tie, the team who finished higher in the regular-season standings advances, unless if both teams finished with the same regular-season record.

5|$|The main rivalry {{heading into}} New Year's Revolution was between John Cena and Umaga over the WWE Championship. The rivalry all {{began on the}} November 6 episode of Raw, one of WWE's main {{television}} programs, when Cena interfered in Umaga's match while accepting a challenge to a match by Kevin Federline. One week later, Jonathan Coachman, an on-screen authority figure of Raw, a portrayed match maker and rules enforcer, announced that a match between Cena and Umaga would take place, which ended in a no-contest due to interference. Three weeks later on the November 27 edition of Raw, Umaga (through Armando Alejandro Estrada) issued a challenge to Cena for the WWE Championship, which Cena accepted. The following week, Cena was assaulted by Umaga after his match, and both were confronted by security. Afterwards, neither of them could touch each other outside of a match until New Year's Revolution. On the December 18 edition of Raw, Cena, along with D-Generation X, (Triple H and Shawn Michaels) faced off against Umaga and Rated-RKO (Edge and Randy Orton). The match ended in a no-contest after Cena and Umaga started brawling to the backstage area. Two weeks later on the January 1 edition of Raw, Cena faced off against Federline in a No Disqualification match, a match {{where there is no}} rules {{and the only way to}} <b>win</b> <b>is</b> by pinfall or submission.
