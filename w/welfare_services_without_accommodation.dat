40|$|In this {{exploratory}} study, several {{conditions are}} identified as facilitative to a mandate of accountability to the <b>welfare</b> <b>service</b> users premised on a social process of cooperative inquiry. Firstly, constructive pressure from an extraneous surveillance power is necessary to instigate the structural inclusion of the <b>welfare</b> <b>service</b> users, <b>without</b> which the prevalent power asymmetry between the <b>welfare</b> <b>service</b> users and the professional service providers cannot be easily rocked. Secondly, enhanced social encounter and sustained interaction between the <b>welfare</b> <b>service</b> users and the service providers {{is the basis for}} emergent trust and alliance facilitative to an eventual power sharing that a mandate of accountability to the <b>welfare</b> <b>service</b> users demands. Thirdly, an ideological allegiance to the liberatory orientation of social work professionalism is imperative to nurturing the service providers' political commitment to the course of partnership with the service-using principal that a mandate of accountability to them requires. Realization of the service providers' accountability to the <b>welfare</b> <b>service</b> users invariably lies in the dialectic interaction between managerialism and professionalism. Meanwhile, the study identifies different manifestation of the user involvement rhetoric between service units serving the elderly and the disabled persons (the "frail" group) and those serving clienteles with psychosocial or moral deficiency (the "deviant" group). It is the contention of this thesis that the greater strength and wider scope of user involvement as featured in the institutional structure of service units in the "frail" group does not necessarily correspond to a state of power symmetry that allows authentic argumentation between the professional service providers and the <b>welfare</b> <b>service</b> users in their discursive encounter. Given the multifarious strategies enabling the service providers to exert control over the <b>welfare</b> <b>service</b> users, the service providers' attitude in their relationship with the <b>welfare</b> <b>service</b> users is crucial for effecting change in the prevailing power position of the <b>welfare</b> <b>service</b> users. Materialization of a mandate of accountability to the <b>welfare</b> <b>service</b> users is hence premised on the prevalence of a cultural code that can embrace a more egalitarian relationship with the <b>welfare</b> <b>service</b> users among the service providers. The last decades have seen a wide-reaching quest for reforms in the Hong Kong public sector. Among the multifarious managerial changes imposed on the Hong Kong <b>welfare</b> sector, the <b>Service</b> Performance Monitoring System instigated in 1999 embraces the irrefutable rhetoric of accountability that subjugates <b>welfare</b> <b>service</b> units in Hong Kong to a renewed mandate of managerial control premised on performance measurement and the enhanced involvement of the <b>welfare</b> <b>service</b> users. It is this policy context that revitalizes the user participation ethos that the profession of social work has always been supporting. By the mixed methodology of survey and case study, the research on which this thesis is based endeavours to locate the structural properties of the commonly incepted user involvement mechanism among the Hong Kong <b>welfare</b> <b>service</b> units, and to discern the processual dynamics in the discursive space enabled by the structural inclusion of the <b>welfare</b> <b>service</b> users. This is meant to advance our understanding on the ways by which user involvement enables a mandate of accountability premised on a cooperative inquiry with the <b>welfare</b> <b>service</b> users. The study identifies a generally limited strength and scope in the user involvement initiatives adopted by the <b>welfare</b> <b>service</b> units. The discursive encounter between the service-using principal and the service-providing agent was also fused with tension. The tension was manifested in the service providers' unease at the accountability discourse, which legitimized the authority of the <b>welfare</b> <b>service</b> users in the management structure of the service units. In a service environment where the managerial discourse and the professional discourse used to compete for dominance, both the managerialist and professional tenets were employed by the service-providing informants to confront the tension and neutralize the implied power of the <b>welfare</b> <b>service</b> users, however meager it was. Whilst structural inclusion of the service users is a necessary condition for tackling the management risk arising from necessary entrustment to the service-providing agent, this thesis contends that structural re-engineering by itself is insufficient to ensure the advancement of the service-using principal's influence in their accountability relationship with the professional service providers.

In this study, we analyzed the correlation between the situation in municipalities and the demand and supply of <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> in the home by correlation analysis to Kagoshima. We used 9 factors and 4 combined factors to analyze the situation in municipalities, and we understood the outline of <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> in the home by analyzing 26 services and 3 combined services. As a result, we got correlation coefficients and we made clear what factors influence the demand and supply of <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> in the home.

40|$|As part of {{a larger}} {{research}} project, we interviewed ten parents with refugee backgrounds about their experiences of contact with child <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> in Norway. Despite parents describing both positive and negative experiences, and trust as well as distrust, we found that fear of the child <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> was a central theme. Thematic analyses showed that fear of the child <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> was not primarily related to the interviewees' own negative experiences, but to a variety of perceptions or representations of the child <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> that informants described as common or prevalent among people from ethnic minorities in general. We found that the representations of the child <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> could be categorized into the following themes: 1) child <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> primarily take children away from parents, 2) child <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> do not go into dialogue with parents, and 3) child <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> discriminate against ethnic minority families. The analysis is discussed critically in light of Axel Honneth and Nancy Fraser's understandings of recognition and social justice. We suggest that the parents’ fear of the child <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> can be understood as fear of experiencing humiliation and disrespect through contact with child welfare services; fear of losing their children, becoming invisible and being discriminated against. A key implication of the study is the need for further research that examines the fear of child welfare among people from ethnic minorities, as well as measures that address distrust of services in parts of the population...|$|R
40|$|There was a {{major change}} in 2000 in the {{national}} policy on social welfare. The Long-term Care Insurance System started in April 2000.

40|$|<b>Welfare</b> <b>service</b> work is {{traditionally}} understood to comprise embodied, situational and social practices {{of care that}} are central to a worker’s professional self-image. Over the past few decades, public management reforms have called for reassessment of <b>welfare</b> <b>service</b> workers’ professional accountability through practices of medico-managerial service management. These practices promote the production of transparency and accountability in <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> work through checking-based trust and disembodied professional practices. This article argues that {{the changes in the}} nature of trust toward <b>welfare</b> <b>service</b> professionals have implications for care work cultures and workers’ professional agency that has traditionally built on the idea of the embodied, situational and social practice of <b>welfare</b> <b>service</b> work. Drawing on an interview study with Finnish <b>welfare</b> <b>service</b> workers (n= 25), the article analyses front-line workers’ descriptions of medico-managerial management in the social and health care sector. The results point to the significance of embodied practices of care in creation of client trust and for workers’ professional self-images. The conclusion is that while disembodied professionalism offers opportunities for workers’ self-management and evaluation of accountability and transparency of service processes, it may disregard the importance of embodied practices for the workers’ professional self-images and client relations...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M Social Work (Social Work)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. An {{exploratory}} {{and descriptive}} research design was selected {{together with a}} combination of both a quantitative and qualitative research approach to obtain the necessary information, insight and knowledge regarding the social <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> offered to female victims of domestic violence in shelters. The motivation for this investigation stemmed from the lack of information on social <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> offered to these female victims. The researcher became aware of this lack of information {{due to the fact that}} only limited studies and investigations had been done into the social <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> offered to female victims of domestic violence within South Africa. The goal of this study is therefore to gain a better understanding of the social <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> offered to female victims of domestic violence in shelters in order to provide recommendations to social service practitioners for the improvement of social <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> in such circumstances. The literature study firstly focused on the theories, conceptualisation and dimensions of domestic violence in order to gain an understanding and knowledge base of the theories that describe domestic violence, concepts that provide an understanding of the phenomenon of domestic violence as well the dimensions of domestic violence. Furthermore, the literature study focuses on the policies, legislations and the government’s commitment to address domestic violence in South Africa. The primary focus of the literature study was to investigate the social <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> that are offered to female victims of domestic violence in shelters. The researcher contacted the Department of Social Development of the Western Cape in order to identify the shelter organisations that offer social <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> to female victims of domestic violence and finally a purposive sampling was done of ten shelters in the Western Cape Metropole area which offer social <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> to female victims of domestic violence. A qualitative and quantitative investigation was performed by means of conducting semi-structured interviews with the aid of an interview guide. The results of the investigation mainly confirmed the findings of the literature study that domestic violence is an inherent part of the life in South Africa, also that domestic violence has a variety of causes and consequences and that social <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> offered to female victims of domestic violence are an important part of the process of empowerment in shelters. The recommendations were aimed at services in shelters and professional persons involved in the rehabilitation and empowerment of abused women during their accommodation in the shelters. The recommendations also included further research to explore the impact of these social <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> on female residents, and to address the areas where social <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> fall short in order to provide insight into the development of other social <b>welfare</b> <b>services</b> that are needed by female residents when entering a shelter...|$|R
