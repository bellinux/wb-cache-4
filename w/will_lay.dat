5|$|The female pallid cuckoo (Cuculus pallidus) <b>will</b> <b>lay</b> {{eggs in a}} willie wagtail nest, {{although}} the hosts often recognise and eject the foreign eggs, so successful brood parasitism is rare. Parasitism by the fan-tailed (Cacomantis flabelliformis), brush, (C. variolosus), Horsfield's bronze (Chrysococcyx basalis), and shining bronze cuckoo (C. lucidus) has also been reported.|$|E
5|$|Severe C. maculatus, infestations {{can affect}} 100% of the stored peas and cause up to 60% grain loss {{within a few}} months. The weevil {{generally}} enters the cowpea pod through holes pre-harvest and lays eggs on the dry seed. The larvae burrow {{their way into the}} seed, feeding on the endosperm. The weevil develops into a sexually mature adult within the seed. An individual bruchid <b>will</b> <b>lay</b> 20–40 eggs, and in optimal conditions each egg can develop into a reproductively active adult in 3 weeks. The most common methods of protection involve the use of insecticides, the main pesticides used being carbomates, synthetic pyrethoids and organophosphates.|$|E
5|$|On February 4, 2014, Steve Ballmer {{stepped down}} as CEO of Microsoft and was succeeded by Satya Nadella, who {{previously}} led Microsoft's Cloud and Enterprise division. On the same day, John W. Thompson took {{on the role of}} chairman, with Bill Gates stepping down from the position, while continuing to participate as a technology advisor. On April 25, 2014, Microsoft acquired Nokia Devices and Services for $7.2 billion. The new subsidiary was renamed Microsoft Mobile Oy. In May 2016, the company announced it <b>will</b> <b>lay</b> off 1,850 workers, taking an impairment and restructuring charge of $950 million. During the previous summer of 2015 the company wrote down $7.6 billion related to its mobile-phone business and fired 7,800 employees from those operations. On September 15, 2014, Microsoft acquired the video game development company Mojang, best known for its wildly popular flagship game Minecraft, for $2.5 billion.|$|E

5|$|Once a queen has {{excavated}} a chamber, she <b>will</b> <b>lay</b> around 20 {{eggs that}} develop into larvae {{in less than}} a month. These eggs take 44 to 61 days to fully develop and emerge as adults. Mature nests range in size, from a few hundred to over 300,000 workers. Most colonies are monogyne, meaning it only has a single queen, but some colonies can have as many as four. Oligogynous colonies also exist, in which multiple queens are present, but they are tolerated equally by workers birthed from different mothers and antagonism exists among queens. Brood discrimination is known based on recognition of kin, and queens will look after their own brood and neglect other brood laid by different queens. Queens display intolerance to each other when the first generation of workers is present, and the queens will separate from each other once the colony grows to a certain size.|$|E
5|$|The {{black-necked grebe}} uses {{multiple}} foraging techniques. Insects, {{which make up}} the majority of this bird's diet, are caught either {{on the surface of the}} water or when they are in flight. It occasionally practices foliage gleaning. This grebe dives to catch crustaceans, molluscs, tadpoles, and small frogs and fish. When moulting at saline lakes, this bird feeds mostly on brine shrimp. The black-necked grebe makes a floating cup nest on an open lake. The nest cup is covered with a disc. This nest is located both in colonies and by itself. During the breeding season, which varies depending on location, this species <b>will</b> <b>lay</b> one (sometimes two) clutch of three to four eggs. The number of eggs is sometimes larger due to conspecific brood parasitism. After a 21-day incubation period, the eggs hatch, and then the nest is deserted. After about 10 days, the parents split up the chicks between themselves. After this, the chicks become independent in about 10 days, and fledge in about three weeks.|$|E
5|$|Observations {{show that}} nuptial flight {{does not occur}} before February. This is based on larvae {{spinning}} into cocoons by November, and by January, these cocoons could not produce adult workers or reproductive males and females. Queens are most likely fertilised by males sometime between February and April; however, scientists have seen alates engage in nuptial flight during March. Before emerging from their parent nest, queens will shed their wings inside the nest and mate with low-flying males nearby. After nuptial flight, a queen will isolate herself and form a small chamber underground, where she remains for seven to eight months. However, it is improbable that a queen can survive on her own storage of fat and wing-musculature for that long. During this time, the queen may emerge from her nest occasionally, but she will only lay eggs from October to November {{when there is a}} rich supply of food. While this may be the case, some queens <b>will</b> <b>lay</b> eggs after a month of isolation during winter. M.regularis is a semi-clasutral ant, meaning that a queen will go out and forage in order to feed her young. Queens will emerge from their nests from time to time, during which they will capture insects for their young or feed on sweet substances. If food sources are deprived, a queen will only rely on her fat to feed the larvae until she perishes or finds food, but the larvae will not be cannibalised, and remain alive until a week after the queen's death. An individual ant may take eight months to develop from an egg to an adult.|$|E

25|$|Exaerete dentata and Exaerete smaragdina, {{which both}} {{belong to the}} Euglossini tribe, are two kleptoparasitic bees that <b>will</b> <b>lay</b> their eggs in Ef. surinamensis nests. A female Ex. dentata will open a sealed cell carefully, {{removing}} bits of bark from the cell cap. Though some bark will fall away, most of it will stay attached to the female for later use. Once she can reach inside, she will use her mandibles to crush the Ef. surinamensis egg {{and replace it with}} her own egg. Then she will reseal the cell using the original bark.|$|E
25|$|The female <b>will</b> <b>lay</b> an egg {{every one}} or two days until she has {{completed}} a clutch, which can consist of 4 to 12 eggs (usually 9). She will then incubate the eggs for three to four weeks while the male brings her food. After the eggs hatch, both parents will feed the chicks. Four weeks after hatching, the chicks can make short flights and begin leaving the nest burrow. The parents will still help feed the chicks for one to three months. While most of the eggs will hatch, only four to five chicks usually survive to leave the nest.|$|E
25|$|In the monogamous species, the {{mantis shrimp}} {{remain with the}} same partner for up to 20years. They share the same burrow and {{may be able to}} {{coordinate}} their activities. Both sexes often take care of the eggs (biparental care). In Pullosquilla and some species in Nannosquilla, the female <b>will</b> <b>lay</b> two clutches of eggs: one that the male tends and one that the female tends. In other species, the female will look after the eggs while the male hunts for both of them. After the eggs hatch, the offspring may spend up to three months as plankton.|$|E

25|$|Double-tailed web spiders mate during summer. After mating, {{the female}} <b>will</b> <b>lay</b> her eggs in an egg sac (an ovoid ball of spider silk) in her sanctuary. She then {{stretches}} her body {{over the surface}} of the egg sac and guards it. This behavior is distinctive and makes the species easy to recognise. The mother does not feed nor leave the sanctuary until the eggs have hatched, which is usually after two or three weeks. Only then will she return {{to the center of the}} web and resume her normal activities. The spiderlings will remain in her sanctuary for a few more weeks before setting out on their own.|$|E
25|$|This {{species is}} solitary until the mating season, which occurs {{during the rainy}} season, and can last for several months, usually from April to May. During this time, males must find females. Typically, female snakes <b>will</b> <b>lay</b> down a trail of pheromones for the males to follow, {{but it is still}} unclear how the males of this species track a female's scent. Another {{possibility}} is that the female releases an airborne stimulant. This theory is supported by the observation of females that remain motionless while many males move towards them from all directions. Male anacondas also frequently flick their tongues to sense chemicals that signal the presence of the female.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the Great Doxology, {{while the}} Trisagion is sung, the epitaphios is taken in {{procession}} around the outside the church, and is then returned to the tomb.
