They settled in California, where Wanda, always fond of nature, was delighted {{to be able to}} raise her own garden. In a letter to a friend, Szigeti describes their California life: Wanda is happy, doing wonders with her gardening, chicken and rabbit raising, preserve and pâté de foie making. She doesn't budge from our place, doesn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> New York even for a visit, which I, for one, can well understand!

Both brothers were married by 2010 and had {{their children to}} care for, and they recognized that {{they would need to}} find other jobs to support their respective families. When Matt had a second daughter, the two agreed to put the series on hiatus, knowing they would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> it but could not guarantee a time frame. Mike also noted that they had spent nearly ten years delivering a weekly cartoon, and believed that, creatively, they needed a break. The success of Homestar Runner led to Matt and Mike getting writing jobs for television animated series Yo Gabba Gabba!, Gravity Falls, The Aquabats Super Show, and Wander Over Yonder.|$|E

However, Ayrton is a traitor, who was not present during the loss of the Britannia, but was {{abandoned}} in Australia after a failed attempt to seize control of the ship to practice piracy. He tries to take control of the Duncan, but by sheer luck, this attempt also fails. However the Glenarvans, the Grant children, Paganel and some sailors are left in Australia, and mistakenly believing that the Duncan is lost, they sail to Auckland, New Zealand, from where they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Europe. When their ship is wrecked south of Auckland on the New Zealand coast, they are captured by a Māori tribe, but luckily manage to escape and board a ship that they discover, to their astonishment, to be the Duncan.|$|E

500|$|The {{soundtrack of}} VVVVVV was {{composed}} by chiptune musician Magnus Pålsson (also known as SoulEye). Cavanagh approached Pålsson to compose VVVVVV after playing Space Phallus, an indie game by Charlie's Games, which featured a song by him. [...] Pålsson {{wrote on the}} Distractionware blog that, upon playing Cavanagh's previous games, he was [...] "amazed at the depth {{that came with the}} games, even though they were small and short." [...] In writing the music for VVVVVV, Pålsson aimed to make [...] "uptempo happy songs that would ingrain themselves into your minds whether you want to or not, hopefully so much so that you’d go humming on them when not playing, and making you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the game even more." [...] The complete soundtrack, titled PPPPPP, was released alongside VVVVVV and is sold as a music download or CD on Pålsson's personal website. On June 12, 2014 Pålsson released a power metal version of the soundtrack titled MMMMMM which was arranged and performed by guitarist Jules Conroy. [...] The album contains a mod file to replace the in-game music with the metal tracks.|$|E
500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "My Heart Is Broken" [...] {{was directed by}} Dean Karr. Filming commenced on December 1, 2011 in Los Angeles. During an interview with MTV News, Lee stated that the visual was [...] "ethereal", also saying that [...] "this [...] {{is going to look}} a lot different. Actually, I kind of wanted it to be the opposite. The first video, for 'What You Want,' was very real, and this is very surreal." [...] The singer further confessed that the clip draws inspiration from dark fantasy horror film Paperhouse (1988) in order to achieve surreality. Lee further explained, [...] " [...] this girl, and everything that she would draw would come to life in her dreams, and she was creating this dream world for herself. And at first, it was cool, but then it's like this nightmare. So I sort of thought it would apply, and be cool, to have it be this dream that you're trapped in. So you're in a place that, at first, is a magical world, but at the same time, you're isolated and trapped there, and that's the reason you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> reality after a time." [...] When filming the video, fiber optics were used reportedly in order to create the effect of things coming to life after drawing them. Lee described the appearance {{of the rest of the}} group in the visual as [...] "sort of like the dream within the dream, in an abyss of darkness".|$|E

60|$|Now, I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> my {{original}} question. Trumbull says that Judge Douglas had a bill with {{a provision in}} it for submitting a constitution {{to be made to}} a vote of the people of Kansas. Does Judge Douglas deny that fact? Does he deny that the provision which Trumbull reads was put in that bill? Then Trumbull says he struck it out. Does he dare to deny that? He does not, and I have the right to repeat the question,--Why Judge Douglas took it out? Bigler has said there was a combination of certain senators, among whom he did not include Judge Douglas, by which it was agreed that the Kansas Bill should have a clause in it not to have the constitution formed under it submitted to a vote of the people. He did not say that Douglas was among them, but we prove by another source that about the same time Douglas comes into the Senate with that provision stricken out of the bill. Although Bigler cannot say they were all working in concert, yet it looks very much as if the thing was agreed upon and done with a mutual understanding after the conference; and while we do not know that it was absolutely so, yet it looks so probable that {{we have a right to}} call upon the man who knows the true reason why it was done to tell what the true reason was. When he will not tell what the true reason was, he stands in the attitude of an accused thief who has stolen goods in his possession, and when called to account refuses to tell where he got them. Not only is this the evidence, but when he comes in with the bill having the provision stricken out, he tells us in a speech, not then but since, that these alterations and modifications in the bill had been made by HIM, in consultation with Toombs, the originator of the bill. He tells us the same to-day. He says there were certain modifications made in the bill in committee that he did not vote for. I ask you to remember, while certain amendments were made which he disapproved of, but which a majority of the committee voted in, he has himself told us that in this particular the alterations and modifications were made by him, upon consultation with Toombs. We have his own word that these alterations were made by him, and not by the committee. Now, I ask, what is the reason Judge Douglas is so chary about coming to the exact question? What is the reason he will not tell you anything about How it was made, BY WHOM it was made, or that he remembers it being made at all? Why does he stand playing upon the meaning of words and quibbling around the edges of the evidence? If he can explain all this, but leaves it unexplained, I have the right to infer that Judge Douglas understood it was the purpose of his party, in engineering that bill through, to make a constitution, and have Kansas come into the Union with that constitution, without its being submitted to a vote of the people. If he will explain his action on this question, by giving a better reason for the facts that happened than he has done, it will be satisfactory. But until he does that--until he gives a better or more plausible reason than he has offered against the evidence in the case--I suggest to him it will not avail him at all that he swells himself up, takes on dignity, and calls people liars. Why, sir, there is not a word in Trumbull's speech that depends on Trumbull's veracity at all. He has only arrayed the evidence and told you what follows as a matter of reasoning. There is not a statement in the whole speech that depends on Trumbull's word. If you have ever studied geometry, you remember that by a course of reasoning Euclid proves that all the angles in a triangle are equal to two right angles. Euclid has shown you how to work it out. Now, if you undertake to disprove that proposition, and to show that it is erroneous, would you prove it to be false by calling Euclid a liar? They tell me that my time is out, and therefore I close.|$|E
