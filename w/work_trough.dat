However, there are many objections to the use of agents, and discussions about whether they add something useful to software technology. Since this is a rather new area, it is obvious that a lot of work still has to be done, some of those research challenges are also discussed here. Mobile work have also grown over the past few years, with more powerful networks available everywhere. This paper present different types of agents, and discusses whether they are useful or not. The agent types include interface agents, cognitive versus reactive agents and mobile agents. In addition multiagent systems are discussed. The paper also has arguments both for and against agents. The last part of the paper discusses how agents can be useful in supporting mobile work. III Preface This paper is the autumn project for 5 th grade with the University of NTNU in Trondheim.

Foi utilizada a técnica de observação de gravações em VT, para a análise do comportamento dos sujeitos, segundo as dimensões sócio-culturais, apresentadas pelo autor. Foi analisado o nível de aprimoramento das ações motoras, através da aplicação de uma avaliação comparativa, inicial e final, na qual, o tratamento estatístico mostrou significativo aperfeiçoamento das ações. Isto veio comprovar a efetividade dos princípios norteadores do programa aplicado. Concluiu-se que, no ambiente gímnico, a criança vivencia diferentes propostas motoras de forma integrada ao seu desenvolvimento. Os resultados desta investigação levaram-nos a compreender que é possível uma intervenção pedagógica, na perspectiva das ações motoras, partindo das capacidades observadas.

40|$|Hyperactivity in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis {{with high}} {{cortisol}} levels and disturbed feedback sensitivity is a frequently observed phenomenon in major depression. Older antidepressants, even tricyclic like Amitriptylin {{are able to}} recover this feedback. The {{aim of this study}} was to clarify by the retrospective analysis of 161 natural courses of treatment, if reduced feedback sensitivity in the dexamethasone suppression test (DST)  vicarious for hyperactivity in the HPA-System  could be a predictor for response to modern antidepressants. The classification of the antidepressants follows different receptor profiles. Drugs, who preferentially works through one transmitter system (improving serotonergic or noradrenergic neurotransmission) and therefore called mono active substances (particularly SSRI and NaRI) are opposed to drugs, who <b>works</b> <b>trough</b> two transmitter systems (improving serotonergic and noradrenergic neurotransmission), thus have a dual acting effect (particularly NASSA and SSNRI). Further studied was the effect of confounding variables on DST status. Nonsuppression in DST was seen more often by patients, who were diagnosed as severe major depression (81, 4 vs. 55, 1 %; p < 0, 002) (LR 9, 973 (1); p < 0, 002) and by patients with attendant psychotic symptoms (44, 2 vs. 19, 5 %; p < 0, 002) (LR 9, 376 (1); p < 0, 002). However, the HAMD- 21 -Scores dont differ between suppressors and nonsuppressors. Logistic regression analysis showed a higher age of onset (46 vs. 39 Jahre; p < 0, 022) (OR = 1, 4; 95 % KI 1, 075; 1, 714) and more often a positive first-degree family history of affective illness (44, 2 vs. 27, 1 %; p < 0, 039) (OR = 2, 5; 95 % KI 1, 082; 5, 550) by patients with hyperactivity in HPA system. The results from the DST as predictor for a preferentially response to dual acting antidepressants (NaSSA, SSNRI) compared to mono active drugs (SSRI) shows no different response rate between suppressors and nonsuppressors. Within the dual acting antidepressants there was a trend for a better response from nonsuppressors to Mirtazapin (NaSSA) (94, 1 vs. 78, 1 %, p < 0, 149) and from suppressors to Venlafaxin (SSNRI) (85 vs. 66, 7 %; p < 0, 130) (both OR = n. s.).

40|$|We present density split statistics, a {{framework}} that studies lensing and counts-in-cells {{as a function of}} foreground galaxy density, thereby providing a large-scale measurement of both 2 -point and 3 -point statistics. Our method extends our earlier <b>work</b> on <b>trough</b> lensing and is summarized as follows: given a foreground (low redshift) population of galaxies, we divide the sky into subareas of equal size but distinct galaxy density. We then measure lensing around uniformly spaced points separately in each of these subareas, as well as counts-in-cells statistics (CiC). The lensing signals trace the matter density contrast around regions of fixed galaxy density. Through the CiC measurements this can be related to the density profile around regions of fixed matter density. Together, these measurements constitute a powerful probe of cosmology, the skewness of the density field and the connection of galaxies and matter. In this paper we show how to model both the density split lensing signal and CiC from basic ingredients: a non-linear power spectrum, clustering hierarchy coefficients from perturbation theory and a parametric model for galaxy bias and shot-noise. Using N-body simulations, we demonstrate that this model is sufficiently accurate for a cosmological analysis on year 1 data from the Dark Energy Survey.

Consistent with previous <b>work,</b> wave <b>troughs</b> are preferred locations for precipitation and typically yield 1. 3 times more rain area {{compared to the}} overall rainy season climatology. Although the contiguous areas of cold cloudiness associated with tropical wave troughs are large and long lived, the underlying precipitation structure is most frequently small, isolated convection from mixed-phase clouds. This mismatch in instantaneous cold cloudiness area versus radar-observed precipitation area in-dicates differences in the rate and nature of evolution between the mesoscale anvil cloud and the underlying precipitating portion of the cloud. Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) were identified during portions of 32 of the 39 wave trough events examined. Convective cells are frequently embedded within stratiform regions. Reflectivity holes or pores in contiguous radar echo have been frequently observed in other regions but are quantified {{for the first time}} in this study.

Esta pesquisa acompanhou o trajeto de artistas (Archipenko, Ducahmp, Gabo, Pevsner, Moholy Nagy, Mari, Bury, Tinguely, Schöffer, Takis, Tatlin, Rodchenko, Man Ray, Calder, Le Parc, Palatinik, Lígia Clarck, Robert Rauchemberg, Christa Sommer&Laurent Mignonneau, Jeffrey Shaw [...] .) que, ao longo do século XX, desenvolveram pesquisas nesta linha. Este trabalho percorreu a história da arte cinética, apontando artistas que exploraram a interatividade (a perceptiva, a espaço/temporal ou a potencial surgida da relação da arte com a tecnologia) além daqueles que buscaram soluções em outras disciplinas, tanto em outras artes como na ciência. Mostra como a complexidade desta interdisciplinaridade criou mudanças de conceitos formais, estruturais e estéticos. Enfoca também como a adesão das artes às novas tecnologias provocou transformações não apenas no mundo dos artistas, mas também no universo institucional que incentiva e promove as artes visuais contemporâneas. Abstract This study {{intends to}} analyze the {{relationship}} between visual arts, science and technology. Its initial reference is the idea written by two Russian Constructivist artists, Naum Gabo and Anton Pevsner, in the Realist Manifesto, in 1920. The two artist, that were also brothers, were trying to free visual arts of its static art's stigma. For that, this research followed some artists' itinerary that developed researches with this approach in the 20 th century, such as Archipenko, Duchamp, Flatters, Pevsner, Moholy Nagy, Mari, Bury, Tinguely, Schöffer, Takis, Tatlin, Rodchenko, Man Ray, Calder, Reads Parc, Palatinik, Lígia Clarck, Robert Rauchemberg, Christa Sommer&Laurent Mignonneau, and Jeffrey Shaw.

40|$|Organisational {{effectiveness}} and survival {{are supposed to}} be dependent on innovation (Nononka, 1991, Shalley, Zhou & Oldham, 2004). Organisational innovation is achieved by employees who intentionally introduce and apply new ideas, processes, products or procedures, new to their role, group or organisation, aiming to benefit the individual, the group, organization or wider society, hence performing innovative work behaviours (IWB) (West & Farr, 1989, p. 16). Until now, the effect of hindrance stressors on innovative behaviours has been neglected. Several meta-analyses and literature reviews, however, have demonstrated the detrimental impact of hindrance stressors such as job insecurity; the feeling of being threatened by unemployment (Mohr, 2000) on employee behaviour. However, the question if and why job insecurity and IWB are related have not been touched upon. In reply to this gap, this PhD aims to investigate and explain the relationship between job insecurity and innovative work behaviour (IWB). In line with the dominant stream of research on IWB, idea generation and idea implementation were considered as distinctive phases in the innovation process. Hence, our first aim is to explore whether a (negative) relationship exists between job insecurity and both components of IWB. In addition, the second aim of this PhD is to explain this relationship by integrating several theoretical frameworks. We constructed a model in which job insecurity is negatively related to innovative <b>work</b> behaviours <b>trough</b> an unjust social exchange or through experienced strain. Both pathways are operationalized in two ways, as both psychological contract breach and effort reward imbalance are examples of an unjust exchange and both a decrease in information processing and limited cognitive self-direction are manifestations of rigid thinking, caused by experienced strain. The theoretical framework was put to an empirical test in three studies. The first study examined the relationship between job insecurity and IWB, as well as the role of psychological contract breach in explaining this relationship. No direct relationship between job insecurity and both phases of IWB was found. However, an indirect relationship between job insecurity and idea generation through psychological contract breach was discovered. Surprisingly, psychological contract breach was positively related to idea generation. The second study further explored the association between job insecurity and idea generation. The results indicated that job insecurity was negatively related to idea generation and that psychological contract breach explained this relationship. The third study investigated whether job insecurity causes strain, which decreases information processing, leading to lower levels of both idea generation and idea implementation. The results were in line with threat rigidity theory. In general, results suggest that the association between job insecurity and IWB may be mediated by psychological contract breach and a decrease in information processing following strain. Therefore, this PhD confirms that job insecurity is negatively associated with behaviours that are crucial for organisational survival and growth. The striking result from study 1 could be attributed to the specific nature of that sample. Future studies should concentrate on further validating the theoretical framework. status: publishe...|$|R

The assignment {{has been carried out}} in behalf of Robotdalen (Västerås, Sweden) in the period 2015 - 01 - 20 – 2015 - 06 - 11. The assignment was to explore possibilities of manufacturing prefabricated wall elements using industrial robots. The task also included to determine which robot tools that was needed and also designing one of them. The purpose of the assignment was to develop the first robot tool required for the manufacturing and to investigate whether the production time can be reduced by 70 percent compared to manual work. To be able to address the problem in a scientific way, the project was split into three phases. The first concerning information gathering, the second concept development and the third the design of the tool. The data collection included analyzing literature, previous work that had been done in the project and conducting study visits. At this stage it was also revealed which tools were necessary and which one of these that would be designed. It takes six different tools to manufacture a wall element and the one that were designed was a multifunctional beam assembly tool. A function analysis and a requirements specification were also established in this phase. They were used as a basis for further work. The goal of the concept generation phase was to develop a final concept where the basic features of the tool was presented. The problem was divided into two parts and each part solution was developed and evaluated individually. Through discussions and the use of appropriate product development tools a final concept could be established. The functions of the final concept was to grab hold of the wooden beam, compress it with another beam and then nail them together. To solve this, existing components as grippers, pneumatic cylinders and linear units were used. The goal of the design phase was to go from a fundamental principle concept to a fully finished and fully specified design. To achieve this CAD were used to calculate the components strength and how they would <b>work</b> together. <b>Trough</b> contact and advice collected from the suppliers the various components were selected. The designing of the tool has been based on the requirement specifications and the function analysis. The result of this project is a robotic tool that manages to nail together two wooden beams with two nails in under five seconds. It does not require any help to accomplish this task and can handle several different beam dimensions. The tool is designed with a frame of aluminum profiles, whereupon the necessary components for the task are installed. Thus it is easy to maintain and change the design of the tool if needed. With the help of this tool, the production time for a wall element is reduced up to 90 percent, according to simulations in the CAD environment compared to manual work...|$|R
40|$|A very {{important}} component to achieve sustainable {{development in the}} energy sector is the improvement of energy efficiency of widely applied thermodynamic processes. Evaluation and optimization methods of energy processes {{play a crucial role}} in fulfilling this goal. A suitable method for the evaluation and optimization of energy conversion systems has been proven to be the exergetic analysis. In this <b>work,</b> three parabolic <b>trough</b> solar thermal power plants are simulated using commercial software, and they are further analyzed and compared using exergetic analysis. The goal is to detect thermodynamic inefficiencies of the three different configurations and propose measures to minimize them. The first simulated solar thermal plant uses a thermal fluid to produce the steam required in a steam generator, the second plant produces the steam directly in the solar field, while the third power plant is used to find trade-offs between the first two alternatives by generating part of the necessary steam using a thermal fluid and part of it in the solar field. The analysis involves the evaluation of the individual components of the power plants, as well as the performance evaluation of the overall structures. When examining the first two simulated plants, we find similar main sources of exergy destruction: the solar field (parabolic trough solar collectors), followed by the steam generator. This shows the importance of an optimal design of these particular components, which could reduce inefficiencies present in the system. Performing a sensitivity analysis using the configuration of the third available power plant we find the best possible combination that minimizes the thermodynamic inefficiencies of the first two alternatives for the generation of steam. The differences in the exergy destruction and exergetic efficiencies of individual components of the three plants are analyzed based on comparable operational conditions. The analysis shows the convenience of using a hybrid configuration where steam is directly generated in the solar field, white it is reheated using a heat transfer fluid...|$|R

Estende-se, todo o trabalho, na passagem de uma semântica literária, para um semântica visual, evidenciando-se uma cumplicidade entre palavras e imagens. Assim é manifestada uma visão de mundos, expressados a partir de Ulisses, de James Joyce, precisamente sobre sua Terceira Parte (Nostos), Episódio 17 -Ítaca. Projeções visuais, através de pinturas e livros de artista, vêm emanadas do pensamento em torno de Nostos, ou seja, a vontade de regressar e identificar-se com um lugar do próprio Eu, dado pela obra de arte. Nesta reflexão há o descobrir onde se espelhar, como um regresso a si mesmo, possibilitada pela obra que se dispõe também ao olhar do Outro. Há o regressar pelo percurso da obra, intermediada pelo olhar do Outro. Desenvolvendo a conexão fundada pela palavra joyceana e instaurando, a partir dela, um signo visual. O texto, nesta dissertação, refere-se à dialética estabelecida no processo da formação da obra, manifestada na sua poiética. This text, whose {{title is}} “Nostos - The Nostalgia we all have”, is a poetic reflexion upon the duality between literature and visual arts. The whole work reflects upon this passage between literary and visual semantics, revealing the intimacy between words and images. A vision of worlds is thus expressed, taking as starting point James Joyce’s “Ullysses”, especially its 3 rd part (Nostos), and its 17 th episode (Ithaca) Visual projections, through the artist’s paintings and books, are emanations of nostos, ie, the longing for return and {{identification with the}} locus of the self, given {{by the work of}} art. In this reflection dwells the finding out of a place to replicate, as if through a looking-glass, {{as if it were a}} return to the self, made possible through the work which presents itself to the Other´s gaze. There is a return through the itinerary of the work, mediated by the Other’s gaze, building upon the connection established by Joyce’s words and construing, upon it, a visual sign. The text, in this work, refers to the dialectics established in the process of formation of the <b>work,</b> made visible <b>trough</b> its poiesis...|$|R
40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} {{outlines}} the use of power spectral density data for estimating the Fatigue Damage of structures or components subjected to random loading. Since rainflow cycle counting has been accepted {{as the best way}} of estimating the fatigue damage caused by random loadings, an obvious target was a method of obtaining the rainflow range distribution from the PSD. Such a solution is derived in this thesis. It forms the major part of the work presented and appears in chapter 5. The rest of the thesis deals with the following topics; Chapter 3 first presents some empirical solutions developed by other authors for the prediction of rainflow ranges from PSD's. An empirical solution developed by Dirlik in 1985 is then used to investigate the effect that stresses contained within a given frequency range have on fatigue damage when there are other frequencies present in the PSD plot. This {{can be thought of as}} 'fatigue damage potential'. Interactions between stresses in different frequency intervals are investigated and it is shown that the fatigue damage potential of one frequency interval is dependent not only on the magnitude of that interval but on the magnitudes of other frequency intervals present. This 'Interaction' effect within the PSD plot, is of specific interest because it can be used to determine the change of fatigue damage for any given structure or component when parts of the signal or PSD plot are altered. Chapter 4 is concerned with methods of regenerating a signal from a PSD in the form of a set of peaks and <b>troughs.</b> <b>Work</b> by Kowalewsld in 1963 is introduced which gives a solution for the joint distribution of peaks and troughs. This distribution can be used to generate a continuous set of adjacent peaks and troughs, of any length, using Monte-Carlo techniques. Approximations in this result are discussed, in comparison with the (distribution of times between) zero crossings problem. An improvement to this joint distribution of peak and troughs is given which uses an empirical solution for the distribution of 'ordinary ranges' (ranges between adjacent peaks and troughs). Chapter 5 forms the major part of the original work presented in this thesis and outlines a theoretical solution for the prediction of rainflow ranges using statistics computed directly from the power spectral density plot. The rainflow range mechanism is broken down into a set of logical criteria which can be analyzed using Markov process theory. The dependence between extremes in this instance is modelled using the prediction of the joint distribution of peaks and troughs proposed by Kowalewsld, and shown in chapter 4. Chapter 6 deals with the fatigue damage assessment and stress history determination of components when only limited samples of the service data are available. An investigation is carried out into the relative merits of time and frequency domain techniques. In particular, the effect of finite sample length was investigated with particular reference to the variance of fatigue predictions using both a rainflow count on a limited time sample and a rainflow count produced directly from a PSD of the same time sample. The frequency domain approach is shown to be at least as accurate as the direct time domain approach. Chapter 7 deals with one specific area where the methods presented in this thesis are applicable, namely, dynamically sensitive offshore structures. Various methods of fatigue damage assessment are highlighted, followed by a detailed description of the 'deterministic/spectral' approach. Many factors which have not previously been recognised are investigated and shown to have significant effect, for instance, tidal effects...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} results of many {{experimental}} tests conducted to gain a deeper insight on the two-phase heat transfer inside minichannels and to characterize the thermal performance of two refrigerants with low environmental impact: propane (R 290) and R 1234 ze(E). Furthermore, some considerations on {{the application of the}} minichannel technology in refrigeration applications and solar concentrators are presented. As pressure drops greatly affect the heat transfer in two-phase flow, the experimental investigation on frictional pressure gradient during adiabatic flow of R 134 a, R 1234 ze(E) and propane (R 290) at different mass velocities and at saturation temperatures between 30 °C and 50 °C has been conducted in two single copper minichannels with a circular cross section and hydraulic diameters of 0. 96 mm and 2 mm. The experimental points are compared with several models available in the open literature. Heat transfer coefficients have been experimentally measured during the condensation at 40 °C and during the vaporization at 31 °C of R 1234 ze(E) and propane at different mass velocities inside a single circular cross section minichannel with an internal diameter of 0. 96 mm. During the test runs, the refrigerant exchanges heat with a secondary fluid, that is distilled water, so the local heat flux is not constant along the measuring section and its accurate calculation becomes the main issue. An assessment of several predicting correlations has been presented for predicting the heat transfer coefficient both in condensation and in vaporization. The condensation process inside minichannels depends on the relative importance of shear stress, gravity and surface tension, especially in presence of corners in the cross section shape. Nevertheless, few studies concern the effect of inclination. In this work, the effect of the channel orientation has been experimentally analyzed and discussed during the condensation of R 134 a and R 32 at 40 °C saturation temperature inside a single square cross section minichannel with a hydraulic diameter equal to 1. 23 mm. Several configurations of the test section from vertical upward flow to vertical downward flow have been examined. When considering the application of the minichannel technology in refrigeration, a general methodology to evaluate the potential heat transfer performance of refrigerants during in-tube condensation is a powerful tool to optimize the performance and the design of heat exchangers. The Performance Evaluation Criteria (PEC) named Penalty Factor for condensation (PF) and Total Temperature Penalization on the refrigerant side (TTP) are applied to rank several refrigerants starting from an experimental database collected in a single circular minichannel with internal diameter of 0. 96 mm at the Two-Phase Heat Transfer Lab at the University of Padova. In electronics, the minichannel technology has proved to be reliable and effective in removing high heat fluxes through small heat transfer areas. This feature has suggested to use minichannel-based receivers for solar concentration systems. In this <b>work,</b> a parabolic <b>trough</b> linear solar concentrator is described and tested using two different minichannel-based receivers: a concentrating hybrid photovoltaic thermal (CPVT) receiver for the cogeneration of electrical energy and heat and a thermal receiver with a selective coating for the generation of heat in the medium temperature range. An optical modeling has been developed for the two cases in order to assess the optical efficiency and the flux distribution on the receiver. Tests with both the receivers have been performed using water in single-phase flow as working fluid {{in order to get a}} preliminary characterization of the whole system. The performance of the thermal receiver at medium temperature (up to 150 °C) when two-phase heat transfer is realized inside the channels has been evaluated through a numerical model. ...|$|R

Osim analize samih naziva poliptiha kao prevladavajućih tipova, nastoji se razotkriti pomake u stilu njihove izrade pa i shvaćanju funkcije tijekom humanističkog razdoblja. Polazište je u očitavanju strukture rezbarenih i slikanih složenih oltara, koji se u datim prostornim i vremenskim okvirima dalo nabrojiti dvjestotinjak mahom iz stvaralaštva poznatih umjetnika. A unatoč raznolikosti postignuća u raslojenim inačicama utvrđuje se vezanost za starija, pretežno trečentističa iskustva mletačkog porijekla, a potom i privrženost pojedinih proizvodnih središta prema određenim rješenjima koliko cjelina toliko posebnih dijelova – predela, kruništa itd. Posebna se pažnja obraća zasebnim nekim oblicima istorodnih oltara – npr. onih s krilima ili ormarima za zatvaranje, pa s ugrađenim starijim ikonama. U svemu se raskriva bogatstvo te likovne baštine iz prelaznog doba umjetničkog razvoja, još i specifičnosti govora stila u pokrajini što će se bolje ustvrditi proradom morfologije istih oltara srodnim analizama u drugom dijelu osvrta. On {{the basis}} of {{numerous}} 15 th century contracts to paint altarpieces in some towns of southern Croatia, the author gives a survey of their typology together with the analysis of archival documents and preserved paintings. He, first, semiologically explains the appearance and growth of altarpieces in mediaeval and early Renaissance period, and mentions the names of painters and wood cutters involved. The author states that gothic polyptychs varying in number and quality of painted panels set in ornamented and guilded frames were still in use. He further explains the problem of their nomenclature recorded in several variations, not necessarily resulting from {{the form of the}} polyptych. Polyptych must have become popular in Dalmatia in the early 14 th century when several monumental pieces were purchased from Italy. Then, <b>trough</b> <b>work</b> of some foreign painters, especially P. Veneziano, it became favourite type of altarpiece which grew even more widespread with the development of Gothic fashion among the local artists. The continuity of triptychs could be traced back to Romanesque time, while one-part sacred paintings-icons ceased to have monumental dimensions and, as such, become object of private cult. Since some 200 polyptychs from Gothic and Renaissance period were mentioned in written sources their comparison based on several criteria was developed. These analyses are confirmed by about twenty preserved works mostly made by Dalmatian artists from the same period. It was found out that the model in Gothic style with usually horizontally arranged sacred pictures in one or two rows lasted longer than the others. Variety was achieved by emphasizing central parts, by enlarging the central panels or by surmounting decorative top. At the same time there was a tendency to cluster painted panels round the central picture which dominated the surrounding ones with its subject, size and arrangement. Although balanced form of an altarpiece was a square one with tendency to grow in hight, this development was not necessarily influenced by Renaissance features, though these were harmoniously incorporated in the alterpiece since {{the first decades of the}} Cinquecento. But predominant tendency of the 15 th century was to follow the Trecento’s experiences, mostly Venetian ones, as is evident from many details. This also confirms provincial character of this art, very often reduced to more craft, after authenticated mediaeval traditions. Otherwise, typological divisions are based on the number of painted panels and their inner distribution. More numerous are those with odd number of members, 5 or 7, with monumental doubling, that is, with 10 do 14 sacred paintings and even more in very rich churches. But it was not possible to deduce any regylarity in putting more lavish or expensive paintings in parish churces, cathedrals of monastery buildings, nor was it possible to confirm that certain artist preferred only particular artistic type, which reveals complex artistic market that followed main currents in towns and villages. In each case commission is an important lead for finding out degree of creativity, but like iconography it was mostly stated in terms of technical details. Analyzing inner structure of those works of art it was possible to distinguish several centers of production, so that Zadar was marked by strong traditionality in spired by northern styles befitting the court, while Dubrovnik led the way in the number of works revealing local traditional features. Typological differences mostly appear i different shape of predella and in the articulation of the top part of the altarpiece. While Venetian Dalmatia remained faithful to the predella-type with sequence of small pictures depicting apostles with or without centrally placed figure of Christ, narrative scenes with horizontally placed panels prevailed in Dubrovnik. Differences were not so marked in the upper part, although craftsmen from Dubrovnik were the first to apply Renaissance features. The polyptychs whose central figures were carved in reliefs, were made in alla the towns but in Dubrovnik the number of so plastically rendered figures could be bigger, even 14, especially from the mid Quattrocento on. Special door-like constructions for closing polyptychs with carved and painted panels started to be used, as is testified by the rich written sources, but only rare pieces have been preserved. The analysis of these interesting documents confirms that mostly Gothic features prevail until the 16 th century. However, morphological analysis will say more on the subject in the second part of the paper. The paper also deals with the special type of altars made by the painters and carvers along the coast. An interesting feature is the appearance of polyptych-like altar with centally placed old icons of outstanding religious importance. The altars of the same type but with the built in tabernacle were in use since the mid 15 th century when they were introduced by new liturgy. Some earlier restored polyptychs were closely studied on {{the basis of}} records and their adherence to traditional restauration techniques was analyzed. So an attempt was made to give a general survey of art in which the typology of a work of art is the basis for further analysis of style and character of painting in Dalmatia at the end of the Middle Ages and at the beginning of modern times. This was accompanied with the names of craftsmen and painters, mostly Croatian ones, living on the coast, but the author’s aim was not to write a history of painting but to give a comment on the typology of production rich in quality and quantity...|$|R
