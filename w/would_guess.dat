Henderson explained, [...] "I don't {{have a problem}} with religion. What I {{have a problem with}} is religion posing as science.

Predicting the word <b>would</b> not be <b>guessed</b> earned $10 for each wrong guess. On the last of six statements, each panelist took only one guess with the first letter revealed and a correct prediction earned $20 per incorrect guess or chance remaining, depending on the guest's prediction.|$|R

He would {{take some of the}} facts about a man of power and he <b>would</b> <b>guess</b> at a lot of the rest and just gotten away at actually getting at the human in it. And that's what's wonderful about the writing I think, is that it acknowledges the people who disliked Steve Jobs, the people he hurt. But in the end, he brings it back to a very simple father-daughter relationship that he has to admit that he has made {{some of the most beautiful}} things in the world." ...|$|E

In her analysis of the course, she states, [...] "While the consensus of informed opinion, based on summaries of research findings, is that interventions similar to the est training have only modestly positive effects, I think that the existing research provides us with an underestimate of the effect of the est training. [...] This training represents a distillation {{of some of the most}} powerful techniques and central precepts for attitude and behavior change … I <b>would</b> <b>guess</b> that the effects of the est training are substantial for a large proportion of people.” ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{character}} of Peter Salter {{was written in}} a way that for most of the episode, the viewing audience <b>would</b> <b>guess</b> which side Salter was really on. Anthony Head, who was well known for his role as Rupert Giles in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, was cast as Peter Salter; during the audition, producer Simon Crawford Collins noted that Head performed it so well, that he would be perfect for the role, and was hired. Hugh Laurie was cast as Jools Siviter; the character was created because of bringing in a lighter element to a generally serious series. The character was also created this way as, according to David Wolstencroft, some people in intelligence and military are generally [...] "funny people", although they have been through [...] "some pretty heinous things". It also became the first episode to feature MI6; the service was depicted as more [...] "" [...] compared with MI5, which the series sources confirmed.|$|E
2500|$|When the two {{themes are}} {{combined}} each note of (the first part of) the Beethoven theme {{is followed by}} the same note in the Elgar theme. So musically Elgar [...] "follows" [...] Beethoven, as Jaeger told him to do (see above, Var. IX) and, by doing so, in the vigorous, optimistic Finale the artist triumphs over his sadness and loneliness, expressed in the minor melody from the beginning. The whole piece is based on this [...] "Elgar theme", in which the Beethoven theme is hidden (and so the latter [...] "goes through and over the whole set, but is not played"). Although Elgar had told Dora Penny in private about the Beethoven story and the Pathétique theme behind the Jaeger/Nimrod-variation (see above, Var. IX) she could not solve the enigma because she did not see the connection between this and the enigma. Elgar had expected she would: [...] "I'm surprised.

2500|$|Upon the film's American {{release in}} 1967, both Philip French and Bosley Crowther were unimpressed {{with the film}} itself. Critic Philip French of The Observer stated: [...] "The {{calculated}} sadism of the film would be offensive {{were it not for}} the neutralising laughter aroused by the ludicrousness of the whole exercise. If one didn't know the actual provenance of the film, one <b>would</b> <b>guess</b> that it was a private movie made by a group of rich European Western fans at a dude ranch... A Fistful of Dollars looks awful, has a flat dead soundtrack, and is totally devoid of human feeling." [...] Bosley Crowther of The New York Times treated the film not as pastiche, but as camp-parody, stating that nearly every Western cliche could be found in this [...] "egregiously synthetic but engrossingly morbid, violent film". He went on to patronise Eastwood's performance, stating: [...] "He is simply another fabrication of a personality, half cowboy and half gangster, going through the ritualistic postures and exercises of each... He is a morbid, amusing, campy fraud".|$|E

2500|$|Music {{channels}} {{owned by}} Viacom, including MTV and VH1, refused to air Jackson's videos or only aired them in minor rotation following the incident, stated to be [...] "a major catalyst" [...] in the album's performance. The Associated Press stated [...] "MTV's [...] "Spanking New" [...] videos in heavy rotation include a gyrating, cleavage-baring Beyoncé [...] and a bleeped-out Eminem with his group D12 [...] Yet the sedate new video from Janet Jackson—a fixture {{on the cable}} channel {{for almost two decades}} and its first [...] "MTV Icon"—has been absent from its playlist. Meanwhile, Jackson's name had barely been mentioned on MTV—unusual for a superstar whose previous projects have typically gotten heavy promotion." [...] Jackson's collaborator Jimmy Jam commented [...] "You can probably read between the lines with MTV." [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>guess</b> that if MTV wanted to play it, they would, but this is just speculation on my part. It certainly could raise a few questions if you have an investigative mind." [...] Jam also commented, [...] "It's tough to click with audiences when you don't get support from the major media outlets." [...] "It's interesting because the video was sent to Viacom" [...] – [...] "but somehow MTV didn't ?" [...] Roger Friedman of Fox News ridiculed the decision; stating [...] "One thing is certain, however: Janet is being scapegoated for her Super Bowl [...] "wardrobe malfunction." [...] Imagine that MTV, where illiteracy and lewdness thrive most of the day, would banish Janet's new video because of her [...] "reputation." [...] Who are they trying to kid? Of course, MTV is a corporate cousin of CBS, where the original snafu happened. But that's just a coincidence!" ...|$|E
2500|$|According to John Richardson in a 2007 Vanity Fair article, [...] "Jason Epstein's {{assessment}} of Silvers as 'The most brilliant {{editor of a}} magazine ever to have worked in this country' has been 'shared by virtually {{all of us who}} have been published by Robert Silvers'". The British newspaper [...] The Guardian called Silvers [...] "the greatest literary editor there has ever been", while Library of America remembered him as [...] "an unsurpassed editor who helped define and sustain the literary and intellectual culture of New York and America". The New York Times described him as [...] "the voracious polymath, the obsessive perfectionist, the slightly unknowable bachelor-workaholic with the colossal Rolodexes and faintly British diction", and, in his obituary, stated that [...] "under his editorship [...] became one of the premier intellectual journals in the United States, a showcase for extended, thoughtful essays on literature and politics by eminent writers." [...] Author Louis Begley wrote, [...] "the ideal editor of my – and I <b>would</b> <b>guess</b> every writer’s – dreams is ... Robert B. Silvers, the editor, brain, and heart of the NYRB. When I write a piece for his magazine, of course I have the immeasurable good luck to be edited by him. [...] There is no experience quite like it. Bob knows everything that's worth knowing, a consequence of his unflagging curiosity." [...] "Bob's edits are scrupulous, comprehensive, and precise. They are frequently aimed at saving the reviewer's face." [...] Roger Cohen wrote, after Silvers' death, [...] "No eye for imprecise thought was ever more discerning; no edit a sharper yet gentler distillation than his. ... He was a stickler for accuracy. The pencil in his hand went {{to the heart of the}} matter." ...|$|E
