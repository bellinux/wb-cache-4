25|$|Composition of isometries mixes kinds in {{assorted}} ways. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> of {{the identity}} as either two mirrors or none; either way, it has no effect in composition. And two reflections give either a translation or a rotation, or the identity (which is both, in a trivial way). Reflection composed with either of these could cancel down to a single reflection; otherwise it gives the only available three-mirror isometry, a glide reflection. A pair of translations always reduces to a single translation; so the challenging cases involve rotations. We know a rotation composed with either a rotation or a translation must produce an even isometry. Composition with translation produces another rotation (by the same amount, with shifted fixed point), but composition with rotation can yield either translation or rotation. It is often said that composition of two rotations produces a rotation, and Euler proved a theorem to that effect in 3D; however, this is only true for rotations sharing a fixed point.|$|E

500|$|In the 1989 film Back to the Future Part II, the Chicago Cubs are {{depicted}} as the 2015 World Series champions, defeating a fictional American League team from Miami (the Miami Marlins {{had not yet}} been formed), whose mascot is an alligator. Screenwriter Bob Gale, who co-wrote the script of Back to the Future Part II, originally intended it as a joke, saying [...] "Being a baseball fan, I thought, 'OK, let's come up {{with one of the most}} unlikely scenarios <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> of'", referencing both the Cubs' long championship drought, and the fact that Florida did not have a baseball team in 1989. He also explained the October 21 prediction was based on the postseason structure at the time, and thus could have been accurate had MLB not added the Division Series in 1994 (but not played until 1995 due to the strike) and the Wild Card Game in 2012. Had the predicted schedule held, Chicago would have swept the Miami team in the World Series with the Series starting October 17th. In the actual 2015 postseason, the Cubs advanced to the National League Championship Series, but were eliminated in four games. Coincidentally, the final game of the NLCS took place on October 21, the same date as the fictional events of Back to the Future Part II. While the film's prediction proved to be incorrect, the Cubs did win the following year's World Series, marking an end to the team's 108-year championship drought.|$|E
