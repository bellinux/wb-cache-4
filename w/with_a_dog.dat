A mostly white dog, he ran briefly with a hunting kennel before {{becoming}} a show dog, most notably with a victory at the show which popularised the Fox Terrier. His main show rivalry was <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> named Tartar, and along <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> named Trap, the three were popular sires of the Fox Terrier breed. He was also involved in the early formation of the Jack Russell Terrier and the Dandie Dinmont Terrier breeds.|$|E

5|$|Norwegian Forest cats have a {{quiet voice}} but can develop a loud voice if kept in a house <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog.</b> They are friendly, intelligent, and {{generally}} good with people. The Norwegian Forest cat {{has a lot of}} energy and can be very demanding of attention. Those cats that live primarily outdoors become swift and effective hunters, but the breed can also adapt to indoor life. If bought from a registered breeder in the USA, they tend to cost from $550 to $800. The cats usually live to be 14 to 16 years old. As they are heavy-boned and tall, they require more food than most other domestic breeds. Males are considerably heavier and larger-boned than females.|$|E

25|$|Shaping {{involves}} gradually {{modifying the}} existing behavior into the desired behavior. If the student engages <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> by hitting it, then {{he or she}} could have their behavior shaped by reinforcing interactions in which he or she touches the dog more gently. Over many interactions, successful shaping would replace the hitting behavior with patting or other gentler behavior. Shaping is based on a behavior analyst's thorough knowledge of operant conditioning principles and extinction. Recent efforts to teach shaping have used simulated computer tasks.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, {{the most}} common breed for these police-type {{operations}} has been the German Shepherd; in recent {{years there has been}} a shift to smaller dogs with keener senses of smell for detection work, and more resilient breeds such as the Belgian Malinois and Dutch Shepherd for patrolling and law enforcement. All MWDs in use today are paired with a single individual after their training. This person is called a handler. While a handler usually won't stay with one dog for the length of either's career, usually a handler will stay partnered <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> for at least a year, and sometimes much longer.|$|E

25|$|The Air Support Unit {{was officially}} created in 1982 but {{the use of}} {{helicopters}} in Thames Valley goes back to 1963, when Oxford City Police experimented with a Brantley helicopter <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> basket attached to the skids. Thames Valley Police rented helicopters for use on special occasions in the 1970s and '80s. The unit was founded in 1982 when part-time daylight flights were routinely contracted and eight Sergeants were transferred from Traffic and Operations to ASU. The unit rented a Eurocopter A350 by the day, planning to fly only 650 hours every year. In 1986 the unit was moved to RAF Abingdon.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, {{there was an}} {{international}} outcry about dog meat consumption in the Philippines after newspapers published photos of Margaret Thatcher, then British Prime Minister, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> carcass hanging beside her on a market stall. The British Government discussed withdrawing foreign aid and other countries, such as Australia, considered similar action. To avoid such action, the Filipino government banned the sale of dog meat, despite dog meat being the third most consumed meat, behind pork and goat and ahead of beef. The ban eventually became totally disregarded, although it was reinstated by President Ramos in 1998 in the Animal Welfare Act (Republic Act 8485).|$|E
25|$|The main {{shopping}} centre is the , {{which was built}} in 1974 as 'The Gracechurch Shopping Centre'.

As a result of investment, the appearance of the {{shopping centre}} was improved in 2006 which included the installation of a glass roof above one of the walkways and the removal of a public square to form a cafe and extra retail units. There are now plans to construct a food court above Bishop's Court in the shopping centre. The shopping centre was formerly home to three bronze sculptures that depict, respectively, {{a boy and a girl}} on rollerskates, a boy <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog,</b> and a boy and a girl playing leapfrog, which have been moved to Rectory Park.|$|E
