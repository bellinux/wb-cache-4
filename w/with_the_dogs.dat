5|$|Scott {{returned}} to Safety Camp <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs,</b> after risking {{his own life}} to rescue a dog-team that had fallen into a crevasse. When the slower pony party arrived, one of the animals was in very poor condition and died shortly afterwards. Later, as the surviving ponies were crossing the sea ice near Hut Point, the ice broke up. Despite a determined rescue attempt, three more ponies died. Of the eight ponies that had begun the depot-laying journey, only two returned home.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{uncertain}} direction and slow {{speed of the}} drift, Nansen calculated that it might take the ship five years to reach the pole. In January 1894 he had first discussed with both Henriksen and Johansen the possibility of making a sledge journey <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs,</b> from Fram to the pole, though they made no immediate plans. Nansen's first attempts to master dog-driving were an embarrassing failure, but he persevered and gradually achieved better results. He also discovered that the normal cross-country skiing speed {{was the same as}} that of dogs pulling loaded sledges. Men could travel under their own power, skiing, rather than riding on the sledge, and loads could be correspondingly increased. This, according to biographer and historian Roland Huntford, amounted to a revolution in polar travel methods.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, back at Cape Evans, the Terra Nova {{arrived at}} the {{beginning}} of February, and Atkinson decided to unload the supplies from the ship with his own men rather than set out south <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> to meet Scott as ordered. When Atkinson belatedly left for the planned rendezvous with Scott, he encountered the scurvy-ridden Edward ("Teddy") Evans who needed urgent medical attention. Atkinson therefore tried to send the experienced navigator Wright south to meet Scott, but chief meteorologist Simpson declared he needed Wright for scientific work. Atkinson then decided to send the short-sighted Cherry-Garrard on 25 February, who was not able to navigate, only as far as One Ton depot (which is within sight of Mount Erebus), effectively cancelling Scott's orders for meeting him at latitude 82 or 82.30 on 1 March.|$|E
5|$|Kenneth {{takes some}} time off from his page duties to {{volunteer}} at an animal shelter. He claims his time on a pig farm {{will allow him to}} not emotionally connect <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> being held there, but he quickly names all of the dogs and adopts the many dogs scheduled to be euthanized that day. Kenneth asks for someone at TGS to adopt the dogs and Tracy quickly brings them all to Liz's apartment to continue annoying her. Liz and Tracy go to Jack to finally resolve their conflict. Jack decides that, because Liz ruined Tracy's life with her book, Tracy should be given the right to ruin her life, and he orders Liz to sign over her life rights to Tracy. Jack tells Liz a story about an accident he had ice climbing, falling into a crevasse. He broke his leg and was unable to climb upwards to escape, but by going deeper down into the crevasse he found a path out. Liz applies this story to her situation with Tracy and stops resisting him, instead suggesting that Tracy make a pornographic film based on her life. Tracy agrees and moves out of Liz's apartment. In addition, Jenna and Liz resolve their issues when they see two adult stars acting out a scene of Jenna (Caitlin Fowler) and Liz (Savanna Samson) apologizing to one another.|$|E
25|$|Determined to {{find the}} grizzly, the two hunters are joined by a third man (Andre Lacombe) and a pack of hunting Beaucerons.

The hunters arrive {{to find the}}ir dogs dead or badly injured, one of them being the favorite Airedale Terrier {{of one of the}} hunters. Finding the frightened cub, they take him to their camp, where he is tethered to a tree, and tormented by the hunters and their vicious dogs. That night, the hunters plot how to kill the grizzly.|$|E

25|$|Their ratting {{talent and}} unique bond was seized {{upon by the}} city's press. Martin's saloon was a {{favorite}} haunt of newspapermen and journalists, so, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> a fixture outside the bar, they never had to travel far for a story. The exploits of the dogs were recorded in detail in the Californian, Daily Alta California, Daily Morning Call, and Daily Evening Bulletin, the editors vying {{with each other in}} their attempts to endow the pair's adventures with thrills and parallels to the human condition. Bummer was portrayed as the gentleman down on his luck, yet still faithful and conscientious, while Lazarus, the mongrel, was cast {{in the role of the}} sly and self-serving fair-weather friend. When Bummer was shot in the leg after only a couple of months, and Lazarus left him to run with another dog, it suited the press no end: Bummer was said to be feeling the sting of ingratitude at the desertion of the cur he had saved from death. Lazarus' return when Bummer recovered only added to the excitement.|$|E

500|$|Coon {{hunting or}} raccoon hunting is the {{practice}} of hunting raccoons, most often for their meat and fur.

Coon hunting is also popular in the rural Midwest. Most coon hunts take place at night, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> being turned loose, trailing and putting the raccoon up a tree without human assistance.

500|$|Nine men {{in teams}} of three would {{undertake}} the sledging work. The first stage, hauling {{over the sea}} ice to Hut Point, started on 1 September 1915, and was completed without mishap {{by the end of}} the month. [...] The second stage, hauling back and forth between Hut Point and the Bluff, proved more problematic, with unfavourable weather, a difficult Barrier surface, and more dissension between Mackintosh and Joyce over methods. [...] This time, Mackintosh favoured man-hauling while Joyce wanted to use the four fit dogs—of the six dogs that had survived the winter, two were pregnant and could not work. Mackintosh allowed Joyce to proceed in his own way, leading a party of six <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs,</b> while Mackintosh [...] continued to man-haul with Wild and Spencer-Smith. Joyce's methods proved the more effective in terms of loads carried and the fitness of the men. The base depot at Minna Bluff was completed by 28 December.|$|E
500|$|Scott's initial {{plan was}} that the dogs would return to base at this stage. However, because of the slower than {{expected}} progress Scott {{decided to take the}} dogs on further. Day and Hooper were dispatched to Cape Evans with a message to this effect for Simpson, who had been left in charge there. On [...] the expedition had reached the Gateway, the name given by Shackleton to the route from the Barrier on to the Beardmore Glacier. At this point a blizzard struck, forcing the men to camp until [...] and to break into rations intended for the Glacier journey. When the blizzard lifted, the remaining ponies were shot as planned, and their meat deposited as food for the return parties. On , Meares and Dimitri turned back <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs,</b> carrying a message back to base that [...] "things were not as rosy as they might be, but we keep our spirits up and say the luck must turn." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first weeks}} in the ice were frustrating, as the drift moved unpredictably, {{sometimes}} north, sometimes south; by 19 November Fram's latitude was south of that at which she had entered the ice. Only {{after the turn of}} the year, in January 1894, did the northerly direction become generally settled; the 80° mark was finally passed on 22 March. Nansen calculated that, at this rate, it might take the ship five years to reach the pole. As the ship's northerly progress continued at a rate rarely above a mile (1.6km) a day, Nansen began privately to consider a new plan—a dog sledge journey towards the pole. With this in mind he began to practice dog-driving, making many experimental journeys over the ice. [...] In November Nansen announced his plan: when the ship passed latitude 83° he and Hjalmar Johansen would leave the ship <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> and make for the pole while Fram, under Sverdrup, continued its drift until it emerged from the ice in the North Atlantic. After reaching the pole, Nansen and Johansen would make for the nearest known land, the recently discovered and sketchily mapped Franz Josef Land. They would then cross to Spitzbergen where they would find a ship to take them home.|$|E

500|$|In a May 7, 1918 {{letter from}} Tobolsk {{to her sister}} Maria in Yekaterinburg, Anastasia {{described}} a moment of joy despite her sadness and loneliness and worry for the sick Alexei: [...] "We played on the swing, that was when I roared with laughter, the fall was so wonderful! Indeed! I told the sisters about {{it so many times}} yesterday that they got quite fed up, but I could go on telling it masses of times... What weather we've had! One could simply shout with joy." [...] In his memoirs, one of the guards at the Ipatiev House, Alexander Strekotin, remembered Anastasia as [...] "very friendly and full of fun", while another guard said Anastasia was [...] "a very charming devil! She was mischievous and, I think, rarely tired. She was lively, and was fond of performing comic mimes <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs,</b> as though they were performing in a circus." [...] Yet another of the guards, however, called the youngest grand duchess [...] "offensive and a terrorist" [...] and complained that her occasionally provocative comments sometimes caused tension in the ranks. Anastasia and her sisters helped their maid darn stockings and assisted the cook in making bread and other kitchen chores while they were in captivity at the Ipatiev House.|$|E
500|$|The entire crew of 33 {{was still}} together. [...] De Long's general {{plan was to}} march with dogs and sleds to the New Siberian Islands, somewhere to the south, and then use the boats to carry his party to the Siberian mainland. [...] According to Petermann's maps his {{intended}} landfall, the Lena Delta, was studded with settlements that would provide them with shelter and safety. By June 25, after a week's hard traveling on the ice, the northward drift had nullified their progress; they were further from land {{than they had been}} when they set out. When the direction of the ice shifted, the party was finally able to advance in the right direction, but the going was slow and difficult. Part of the problem lay <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> who, after [...] nearly two years of relative idleness, were either lethargic or quarrelsome, unable to work in harness. Some of the worst offenders were shot for food. On July 12, land appeared to the south; fleetingly, De Long thought this was part of the New Siberian Islands, but it was another uncharted island. When the party reached it on July 29, De Long named it Bennett Island, and called the point of landing [...] "Cape Emma", after his wife. Meanwhile, hundreds of miles to the east, the Corwin had given up on its rescue mission. After months of searching vainly for definite news or traces of Jeannette, Hooper had concluded that the vessel was lost, and headed back to San Francisco.|$|E
500|$|Boys called Vāghyā (or Waghya, {{literally}} [...] "tigers") {{and girls}} called Muraḹi were formerly dedicated to Khandoba, {{but now the}} practice of marrying girls to Khandoba is illegal. The Vaghyas act as the bards of Khandoba and identify themselves <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> of Khandoba, while Muralis act as his courtesans (devanganas— nymphs or devadasis). The Vaghyas and their female counterparts Muralis sing and dance in honour of Khandoba and narrate his stories on jagarans— all night song-festivals, which are sometimes held after navas fulfilment. Another custom was ritual-suicide by Viras (heroes) in the cult. According to legend, an [...] "untouchable" [...] Mang (Matanga) sacrificed himself for {{the foundation of the}} temple at Jejuri to persuade Khandoba to stay at Jejuri forever. Other practices in the cult include the belief that Khandoba possesses the body of a Vaghya or devrsi (shaman). Another ritual in the cult is an act of chain-breaking in fulfilment of a vow or an annual family rite; the chain is identified with the snake around Shiva's neck, which was cut by the demons in the fight. Another rite associated with the family duties to please Khandoba is the tali bharne, which is to be performed every full moon day. A tali (dish) is filled with coconuts, fruits, betel nuts, saffron, turmeric (Bhandar) and Bel leaves. Then, a coconut is placed on a pot filled with water and the pot is worshipped as an embodiment of Khandoba. Then, five persons lift the tali, place it repeatedly on the pot thrice, saying [...] "Elkot" [...] or [...] "Khande rayaca Elkot". Then the coconut in the tali is broken and mixed with sugar or jaggery and given to friends and relatives. A gondhal is performed along with the tali bharne. A gondhal is a ritualistic folk art in which the performer Gondhalis invoke the deities.|$|E
