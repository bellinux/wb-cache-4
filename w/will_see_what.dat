500|$|On 10 September 2008, {{with oil}} prices still near US$100/bbl, a {{production}} dispute {{occurred when the}} Saudis reportedly walked out of a negotiating session where rival members voted to reduce OPEC output. Although Saudi delegates officially endorsed the new quotas, they stated anonymously {{that they would not}} observe them. The New York Times quoted one such delegate as saying: [...] "Saudi Arabia will meet the market's demand. We <b>will</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> the market requires and we will not leave a customer without oil. The policy has not changed." [...] Over the next few months, oil prices plummeted into the $30s, and did not return to $100 until the Libyan Civil War in 2011.|$|E
500|$|Later, Khánh phoned Taylor {{from his}} office and {{expressed}} his desire to resign and go abroad along with several other generals, asking for the Americans to fund the travel costs. He then read Taylor the list of generals for whom arrangements needed to be made, and asked the ambassador to repeat the names for confirmation. Taylor did so, unaware Khánh was taping the dialogue. Afterwards, Khánh played the tape out of context to his colleagues, giving them the impression Taylor was calling for their expulsion from their own country. Khánh then asked his colleagues {{to participate in a}} campaign of fomenting anti-American street protests and to give the impression the country did not need Washington's aid. A CIA informant reported the recent arguments with Taylor had incensed the volatile Thi so much that he had privately vowed to [...] "blow up everything" [...] and [...] "kill Phan Khắc Sửu, Trần Văn Hương and Nguyễn Khánh {{and put an end to}} all this. Then we <b>will</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> happens." ...|$|E

The film received a 96% [...] "Certified Fresh" [...] rating by Rotten Tomatoes {{with an average}} rating of 8.3 out of 10, with 49 critics giving generally favorable reviews and only two negative reviews; the site's consensus states [...] "You <b>will</b> <b>see</b> <b>what's</b> coming, but the masterful performances, especially Thornton's, will leave you riveted." ...|$|R
500|$|The deposal {{prompted}} US Ambassador Maxwell D. Taylor to angrily berate Thiệu, Thi, Kỳ and Cang in {{a private}} meeting and threaten to cut off aid {{if they did not}} reverse their decision. Although nettled by the outburst, Thi took a perverse pleasure in riling Taylor. He was seen by a CIA officer soon after, grinning. When asked why he was happy, Thi said [...] "Because {{this is one of the}} happiest days of my life...Today I told the American ambassador that he could not dictate to us." [...] The dispute escalated for a few days as the junta threatened to expel Taylor, and Khanh went on a media offensive. A CIA informant reported that the arguments with Taylor had incensed the volatile Thi so much he privately vowed to [...] "blow up everything" [...] and [...] "kill Phan Khac Suu, Trần Văn Hương and Nguyen Khanh and put an end to all this. Then we <b>will</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> happens." [...] However, the dispute galvanized the officers' nationalist sentiments and they rallied around the embattled Khánh for a time. They ignored Taylor's threats without suffering repercussions because the Americans were too intent on defeating the communists to cut funding in an attempt to force policy change in Saigon. Thi became notorious for his involvement in infighting. A CIA dossier compiled in the 1960s said that Thi [...] "is like a card player, placing his bets now on this leader, then on another; he plays his subordinates in the same manner. His only real objective is to continue the game." [...] Time described him as [...] "vain, ambitious, an inveterate intriguer". The New York Times described him as [...] "a coup specialist".|$|E
2500|$|The Soviet {{establishment}} considered Heifetz and {{his teacher}} Leopold Auer as traitors {{to their home}} country for emigrating to the US. Meanwhile, musicians who remained, such as David Oistrakh, were seen as patriots. Heifetz greatly criticized the Soviet regime; he condemned the International Tchaikovsky Competition for being biased against Western competitors. During the Carl Flesch Competition in London, Oistrakh tried to persuade Erick Friedman, Heifetz's star student, to enter the Tchaikovsky Competition, {{of which he was}} the principal juror. Hearing of this, Heifetz strongly advised against it, warning Friedman, [...] "You <b>will</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> will happen there." ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{rule was}} one of the few moments in the history of Islam where Muslims were united as a single community. Abdullah ibn Masʿud would often weep {{whenever}} the subject of Umar was brought up. He said: Umar was a fortress of Islam. People would enter Islam and not leave. When he died, the fortress was breached and now people are going out of Islam [...] Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah before Umar died famously said: If Umar dies, Islam would be weakened People asked him why and his reply was You <b>will</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> i am speaking about if you survive ...|$|E

He hopes that his allies who are {{outside of the}} dome <b>will</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> is happening, and get away before they get hurt. Mazrim Taim, the M'hael, orders the Asha'man to raise the dome by two spans. The Shaido Aiel who are now within the dome are then killed as they {{literally}} explode when the Asha'mans' weaves touch them. A [...] "Rolling Ring of Earth and Fire" [...] causes the ground around the dome to split and fire to pour out from its cracks. The Shaido, now terrified, break and run, thousands dead left behind in their wake.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2011, in an {{interview}} with Gamasutra, Rockstar executive Dan Houser revealed the studio may focus on a sequel for Bully once Max Payne 3 is released. [...] "Contrary to a lot of people, we like to {{take a little bit of}} time at the end of a game before starting a sequel, so we can wait for the excitement or disappointment and everything else of the experience to shake down and really see what we should do in the next game," [...] he said. [...] "So we knew that we didn't want to start doing the Bully sequel instantly at that second with those guys -- even though it is a property that, like Max, we adore and might come back to in the future. There was just no impetus to do that then. So we said, 'You can do Max, and then we <b>will</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> we can do with Bully." ...|$|E

60|$|CONRAD. Pshaw! Everybody {{would like}} to have a million of money. Why havnt they? Because the men who {{would like to}} be millionaires wont save sixpence even with the chance of {{starvation}} staring them in the face.
