2500|$|UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on 5 June {{that the}} IDF raid of the Mavi Marmara should be {{investigated}} by a New Zealand-led committee, with Israeli and Turkish deputies. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hoped the Israeli-led process would {{put an end to}} efforts in the United Nations to set up an international inquiry, which many Israelis fear would be biased. In Israel and around the world, some said the committee lacked sufficient credibility and investigative powers. White House backed Israeli internal inquiry into Gaza flotilla deaths and said that the Israeli inquiry meets the standard of [...] "prompt, impartial, credible and transparent investigation". U.K. Foreign Secretary William Hague, speaking in Luxembourg, stressed the need for [...] "a truly independent inquiry and a thorough investigation that the international community can respect". Israeli Intelligence and Atomic Energy Minister Dan Meridor told Turkish media that there [...] "will be international elements in the commission <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> formed".|$|E
2500|$|The brick tea is {{packaged}} [...] {{either in}} the courtyard or in the street outside, and {{it is quite a}} complicated process. When the coolies bring it in from Ya'an, it has to be repacked before being consigned upcountry, for in a coolie's load the standard subunit is four bricks lashed together, and these would be the wrong shape for animal transport. So they are first cut in two, then put together in lots of three, leaving what they call a gam, which is half a yak's load. Tea <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> consumed reasonably soon is done up in a loose case of matting, but the gams, which are bound for remote destinations, perhaps even for Lhasa, are sewn up in yakhides. These hides are not tanned but are merely dried in the sun; when used for packing they are soaked in water to make them pliable and then sewn very tightly around the load, and when they dry out again the tea is enclosed in a container which is as hard as wood and is completely unaffected by rain, hard knocks, or immersion in streams. The Tibetan packers are a special guild of craftsmen, readily identifiable by the powerful aroma of untanned leather which they exude.|$|E

[...] In February 2015, Azalea tweeted there were [...] "epic" [...] ongoing plans for the song. For Spears's Billboard magazine cover story, published online on March 12, 2015, it was reported that despite Spears being back in the recording studio as back as in September 2014 working on a duet with Azalea, among other tracks, a proper full-length album would not be coming soon. Spears further explained, [...] "I'm gonna do [...] slowly but surely [...] I'm gonna try to do my best to do an amazing album, but it's not my full priority right now". Azalea confirmed the title of the track the following week. Afterwards, in Spears's cover story with People magazine, it was announced that [...] "Pretty Girls" [...] would be released on May 5.|$|E
2500|$|When Dyer's casting in {{the series}} was announced, Daniel Kilkelly from {{entertainment}} website Digital Spy expected reactions to be mixed, as comments made by the website's readers about Dyer {{in the past have}} included both praise and derision, and felt the announcement would spark debate. Kilkelly felt positive about the casting, saying: [...] "Dyer has a strong screen presence <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> crucial when it comes to taking over such an important role in EastEnders. Recent new characters to join the show have seemed to stay on the sidelines with no clear direction, while the plan for Mick is for him to join the Square and take on his new job straight away. Dyer should definitely be up to the task of hitting the ground running." [...] He was relieved that Dyer would not be playing another hardman character, saying that [...] "it should {{be interesting to see how}} he rises to the challenge." [...] However, he opined that casting a well-known actor who divides opinions could be a risk, as fans of the show may see Dyer, rather than his character, moving into the show, and hoped that the actor's profile would not lead to him leaving the series after only a short stint. Alex Fletcher from the site said, [...] "Danny Dyer. In EastEnders. The two things together still don't quite seem believable, but it really is happening", and predicted he would be [...] "awesome".|$|E

60|$|Why none of {{the people}} who reside in these places ever look out of window, or take an airing in the piece of ground <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a garden by-and-by, is one of the wonders I have added to my always-lengthening list of the wonders of the world. I have got it into my mind that they live in a state of chronic injury and resentment, and on that account refuse to {{decorate}} the building with a human interest. As I have known legatees deeply injured by a bequest of five hundred pounds because it was not five thousand, and as I was once acquainted with a pensioner on the Public to the extent of two hundred a year, who perpetually anathematised his Country because he was not in the receipt of four, having no claim whatever to sixpence: so perhaps it usually happens, within certain limits, that to get a little help is to get a notion of being defrauded of more. 'How do they pass their lives in this beautiful and peaceful place!' was the subject of my speculation with a visitor who once accompanied me to a charming rustic retreat for old men and women: a quaint ancient foundation in a pleasant English country, behind a picturesque church and among rich old convent gardens. There were but some dozen or so of houses, and we agreed that we would talk with the inhabitants, as they sat in their groined rooms between the light of their fires and the light shining in at their latticed windows, and would find out. They passed their lives in considering themselves mulcted of certain ounces of tea by a deaf old steward who lived among them in the quadrangle. There was no reason to suppose that any such ounces of tea had ever been in existence, or that the old steward so much as knew what was the matter;--he passed HIS life in considering himself periodically defrauded of a birch-broom by the beadle.|$|E
