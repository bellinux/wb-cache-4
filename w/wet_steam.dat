50|$|As <b>wet</b> <b>steam</b> {{exits the}} tumbler, it is {{mechanically}} compressed (hence the name) to extract water vapor and transfer {{the heat of}} vaporization to the remaining gaseous steam. This pressurized, gaseous steam is then allowed to expand, and is superheated before being injected back into the tumbler where its heat causes more water to vaporize from the clothing, creating more <b>wet</b> <b>steam</b> and restarting the cycle.|$|E
50|$|Steam is {{traditionally}} created by heating a boiler via burning coal and other fuels, {{but it is}} also possible to create steam with solar energy.

40|$|This {{contribution}} aims {{to analyze}} micro-CHP units based on Rankine cycles. Two types of expander are considered: {{a small scale}} inward flow radial turbine and a volumetric scroll type expander. This latter, should allow to overcome the limitation imposed by a standard steam-turbine that arise when the required shaft-power is very low. Moreover, the scroll expander will also allow to easily treat <b>wet</b> <b>steams,</b> which must be avoided when considering a turbo-expander. The final aim is to deduce {{which one of the}} two types of expander is more suitable, with a specified target performance and the availability of a certain hot source. In order to define the thermodynamic expansion process, the analysis uses a onedimensional model of the radial turbine, previously developed by the authors, and of an estimation of the scroll expander efficiency. Also, the analysis is carried out for different working fluids, such as water, and two organic fluids, cyclohexane and toluene. Through the discussion of the results, for a specified set of constraints (e. g. expander inlet temperature, temperature of condensation, expander geometrical parameters) it is possible to deduce important indications on the most suitable expander for a given cycle layout...|$|R
50|$|The Wolf Creek and Callaway plants {{each have}} single half speed, 1,800 RPM (60 Hz), steam {{turbine-alternator}} sets which use the steam produced {{from the heat}} generated in the reactor to produce about 1,200 MW of electricity at the US grid frequency of 60 Hz. Such large turbo-alternator sets were not available in the UK at the time Sizewell B was designed. So that orders could be given to UK manufacturers, and to avoid project risk in dealing with what were at the time newly designed very large turbo-alternator sets, Sizewell B uses two full-speed, 3,000 RPM (50 Hz), nominal 660 MW turbo-alternator sets {{similar to those used}} at Drax coal-fired power station, and at the last of the AGRs Heysham 2, but adapted to cope with the <b>wetter</b> <b>steam</b> conditions produced by the PWR steam supply system. PWR steam supply systems produce saturated steam at lower temperature and pressure than the dry superheated steam produced by AGR reactors or coal-fired power stations, and the high- and intermediate-pressure stages of the steam turbines have to be designed cope with this Sizewell B can run at half power using one turbo-alternator.|$|R

40|$|Spruce wood {{specimens}} were heat-treated in saturated {{water vapor}} (steaming) {{and in the}} absence of moisture (dry heating) at 120 – 180 °C, and their wet volumes were measured during alternate wetting and drying cycles. After the first wetting and drying cycle, the <b>wet</b> volume of <b>steamed</b> wood decreased and then remained unchanged during the following alternate wetting and drying cycles. The wet volume regained its initial level when soaked in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), followed by washing in water, but decreased again after subsequent drying and rewetting. Such reversible changes were not observed in unheated and dry-heated specimens. This suggested a hydrophobic structure formed during drying or plastic expansion of cell lumen due to steaming and soaking in DMSO. Although heat treatments reduced the hygroscopicity of the wood, steamed wood showed more swelling, i. e., lower dimensional stability than unheated and dry-heated wood. This is probably because steaming caused serious degradation of cell wall components, therefore loosening its fiber-reinforced structure restricting the swelling of the cell wall. When wood is exposed to alternate <b>wetting</b> and drying, <b>steaming</b> is not advisable because it may reduce the dimensional stability of the wood...|$|R
40|$|Background: Contamination is a {{key element}} in cystic fibrosis. For this reason, {{nebulizer}} hygiene is an important, but complex and time-consuming task for cystic fibrosis patients. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare different steam disinfection and drying protocols. Methods: One hundred nebulizer parts were inoculated with cystic fibrosis-related bacteria in high concentrations (Burkholderia multivorans 3. 9 × 1010 /ml, Staphylococcus aureus 8. 9 × 108 /ml and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2. 1 × 109 /ml). Tubes with Mycobacterium abscessus complex were additionally tested. Six steam disinfectors were compared. Different methods of drying were examined. Results: All tested bacteria were efficiently killed by the different steam disinfectors tested. The risk of contamination depended on the method of drying. Conclusions: Steam disinfection is a safe disinfection method. It is better to leave the nebulizers <b>wet</b> after <b>steam</b> disinfection than to manipulate them by active drying, which seems to be a source of recontamination...|$|R

40|$|A Pd/ZnO sample {{prepared}} by the polygonal barrel-sputtering method was tested for the performance in methanol steam reforming in comparison with a similar sample from a conventional wet process. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that sputtering produced smaller and more uniformly sized Pd nano-particles than the <b>wet</b> process. <b>Steam</b> reforming of methanol was conducted by supplying a gaseous mixture of methanol + H_ 2 O + Ar. In the experiment with the polygonal barrel-sputtering method, H 2 generation started at a lower temperature (80 aq than that for the wet process (100 ℃). In addition, H_ 20 was scarcely consumed at both of the samples when H 2 was generated at< 100 ac. These results suggested that the sputtering preparation allowed direct decomposition of methanol to occur easily at less than 100 ℃, as supported by the observed relationship between the CO/CO_ 2 generation ratio and the reaction temperature. It {{should be noted that}} the smaller Pd particle sizes for the sputtering method were maintained at reaction temperatures up to 150 ℃...|$|R

60|$|After this {{incident}} the expedition continued its progress up the White Nile. The sudd which {{was met with}} two days' journey south of Khartoum did not {{in this part of}} the Nile offer any obstacle to navigation, as the strong current of the river clears the waterway; but on either side of the channel a belt of the tangled weed, varying from twelve to twelve hundred yards in breadth, very often prevented the steamers from approaching the bank to tie up. The banks themselves depressed the explorers by their melancholy inhospitality. At times the river flowed past miles of long grey grass and swamp-land, inhabited and habitable only by hippopotami. At times a vast expanse of dreary mud flats stretched as far as the eye could see. At others the forest, dense with an impenetrable undergrowth of thorn-bushes, approached the water, and the active forms of monkeys and even of leopards darted among the trees. But the country--whether forest, mud-flat, or prairie--was always damp and feverish: a <b>wet</b> land <b>steaming</b> under a burning sun and humming with mosquitoes and all kinds of insect life.|$|R
