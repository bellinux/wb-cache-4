5|$|Despite {{competition}} from other materials, copper remains the preferred electrical conductor in nearly all categories of electrical <b>wiring</b> except overhead electric power transmission where aluminium is often preferred. Copper wire is used in power generation, power transmission, power distribution, telecommunications, electronics circuitry, and countless types of electrical equipment. Electrical <b>wiring</b> {{is the most important}} market for the copper industry. This includes structural power <b>wiring,</b> power distribution cable, appliance wire, communications cable, automotive wire and cable, and magnet wire. Roughly half of all copper mined is used for electrical wire and cable conductors. Many electrical devices rely on copper <b>wiring</b> because of its multitude of inherent beneficial properties, such as its high electrical conductivity, tensile strength, ductility, creep (deformation) resistance, corrosion resistance, low thermal expansion, high thermal conductivity, ease of soldering, malleability, and ease of installation.|$|E

5|$|At the Princess, sound {{installation}} {{was completed}} by August 16. An entire page of the Edmonton Bulletin was devoted to the reopening, including a congratulating ad from a local record store, an ad for the electrical contractors who installed the <b>wiring,</b> and a message congratulating the Princess placed by the managers of three other establishments already wired for sound: the Rialto, Empress and Capitol Theatres. The physical renovations necessary to accommodate the new <b>wiring</b> were carried out by S. H.

Another variations are the Razor <b>Wire</b> Steel Cage Match, a similar concept to that of the barbed <b>wire</b> cage match, however the barbed <b>wire</b> is replaced by razor <b>wire</b> and is wrapped around the top, corners, and walls of the cage, and Barbed <b>wire</b> Razor <b>wire</b> Steel Cage match {{is the same as the}} barbed <b>wire</b> cage match, however the top, corners, and walls of the cage are covered with barbed <b>wire,</b> further covered with razor <b>wire.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Wire</b> {{wrapping}} {{comes from}} the tradition of rope splicing. Early <b>wire</b> wrapping was performed manually; a slow and careful process. <b>Wire</b> wrapping was used for splices and for finishing cable ends in suspension bridge <b>wires</b> and other <b>wire</b> rope rigging, usually with a smaller diameter <b>wire</b> wrapped around a larger <b>wire</b> or bundle of <b>wires.</b> Such techniques were purely mechanical, to add strength or prevent fraying.|$|R
5|$|Lee was {{met with}} resistance, because the audio {{industry}} at the time didn't believe cables made an audible difference in the sound and wire {{was something that was}} normally provided for free. Lee did demonstrations at retailers comparing Monster cables to zip cord to convince consumers that expensive equipment was wasted on cheap <b>wiring.</b> Sales picked up as retailers saw the <b>wiring</b> as an opportunity for higher profit margins. This led Lee to provide incentives to retail salespeople to sell the cabling, rather than spend money on advertising. This led to criticisms that his business model creates aggressive salespeople.|$|E

5|$|Another {{variant of}} the Panzer IV was the Panzerbefehlswagen IV (Pz.Bef.Wg.IV) command tank. This {{conversion}} entailed the installation of additional radio sets, mounting racks, transformers, junction boxes, <b>wiring,</b> antennas and an auxiliary electrical generator. To {{make room for the}} new equipment, ammunition stowage was reduced from 87 to 72 rounds. The vehicle could coordinate with nearby armor, infantry or even aircraft. Seventeen Panzerbefehlswagen were built on Ausf. J chassis in August and September 1944, while another 88 were based on refurbished chassis.|$|E
30|$|Low-carbon steel <b>wires,</b> {{high-carbon}} steel <b>wires,</b> stainless steel <b>wires,</b> copper <b>wires,</b> aluminum <b>wires,</b> magnesium <b>wires,</b> gold <b>wires,</b> and amorphous <b>wires</b> {{have been used}} as materials for structures, medical devices, electrical devices, meshes, goods for hobby and so on (Yoshida 2000). These <b>wires</b> are required to be much finer than typical <b>wires,</b> because the weight reduction and miniaturization of various products has progressed. For example, gold <b>wires</b> less than 0.02  mm in diameter have been required because of decreasing spacing between bonding <b>wires.</b> Kim et al. investigated mechanical properties of ultra-fine Au <b>wires</b> {{for the development of a}} fine and high-strength Au <b>wire</b> (Kim et al. 2006). Daitoh et al. (Daitoh et al. 2000) and Tarui et al. (Tarui et al. 2005) developed the steel <b>wire</b> with a diameter of 0.02  mm and tensile strength higher than 4  GPa and investigated the microstructure of the <b>wire.</b> Furthermore, Li et al. succeeded in the development of ultra-fine steel <b>wire</b> with a diameter of 0.02  mm and tensile strength of 7  GPa (Li et al. 2014). However, ductility like an elongation of the <b>wire</b> was not measured sufficiently.|$|R
5000|$|Half-hard <b>wire</b> is {{slightly}} stiffer than dead soft <b>wire.</b> Half-hard <b>wire</b> is excellent for making tight, angular bends, for making loops in <b>wire,</b> and for wrapping <b>wire</b> around itself.

50|$|Jump <b>wires</b> (also called jumper <b>wires)</b> for {{solderless}} breadboarding can {{be obtained}} in ready-to-use jump <b>wire</b> sets or can be manually manufactured. The latter can become tedious work for larger circuits. Ready-to-use jump <b>wires</b> come in different qualities, some even with tiny plugs attached to the <b>wire</b> ends. Jump <b>wire</b> material for ready-made or homemade <b>wires</b> should usually be 22 AWG (0.33 mm2) solid copper, tin-plated <b>wire</b> - assuming no tiny plugs are to {{be attached to the}} <b>wire</b> ends. The <b>wire</b> ends should be stripped 3/16 to 5/16 in. Shorter stripped <b>wires</b> might result in bad contact with the board's spring clips (insulation being caught in the springs). Longer stripped <b>wires</b> increase the likelihood of short-circuits on the board. Needle-nose pliers and tweezers are helpful when inserting or removing <b>wires,</b> particularly on crowded boards.|$|R

50|$|<b>Wire</b> {{wrapping}} {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} techniques for making handmade jewelry. This technique is done with some jewelry <b>wire</b> and findings similar to <b>wire</b> (like head-pins) to make components. <b>Wire</b> components are then connected to one another using mechanical techniques with no soldering or heating of the <b>wire.</b> Frequently, in this approach, a <b>wire</b> is bent into a loop or other decorative shape and then the <b>wire</b> is wrapped around itself to finish the <b>wire</b> component making that loop or decorative shape permanent. Because of this technique for wrapping <b>wire</b> around itself, this craft is called <b>wire</b> wrapping.|$|R
