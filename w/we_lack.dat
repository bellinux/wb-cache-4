25|$|Mechanism: In the future, further {{investigation}} of the precise steps involved in the mechanism of hydrogen bond catalysis will be required that will enable chemists to rationally design catalytic strategies for more complex or more useful transformations. For comparison, the basic steps of palladium-catalyzed cross coupling have been systematically and thoroughly studied {{over the last few}} decades and have led to dramatic advances in catalytic scope, control and reaction design principles. For example, improved understanding of oxidative addition has led to aryl chlorides becoming practical coupling partners, while improved understanding of reductive elimination has {{led to the development of}} new reactions involving sp3 centers. Knowing these fundamental catalytic steps, the ability to rationally plan new reactions and cascades has been extremely useful in the field of total synthesis. In contrast, <b>we</b> <b>lack</b> a general, systematic mechanistic understanding of the steps of hydrogen bond catalysis and how to influence them. Detailed mechanistic studies have so far been limited to individual systems, and their findings have not been of demonstrable predictive use.|$|E
500|$|Jerry Coyne, {{writing in}} Nature, {{described}} {{the book as}} for the interested lay reader, and called it [...] "a paean to recent advances in developmental genetics, and what they may {{tell us about the}} evolutionary process." [...] For him, the centrepiece was [...] "the unexpected discovery that the genes that control the body plans of all bilateral animals, including worms, insects, frogs and humans, are largely identical. These are the 'homeobox' (Hox) genes". He called Carroll a leader in the field and an [...] "adept communicator", but admits to [...] "feeling uncomfortable" [...] when Carroll sets out his personal vision of the field [...] "without admitting that large parts of that vision remain controversial." [...] Coyne pointed out that the idea that the [...] "'regulatory gene' is the locus of evolution" [...] dates back to Roy Britten and colleagues around 1970, but was still weakly supported by observation or experiment. He granted that chimps and humans are almost 99% identical at DNA level, but points out that [...] "humans and chimps have different amino-acid sequences in at least 55% of their proteins, a figure that rises to 95% for humans and mice. Thus we can't exclude protein-sequence evolution as an important reason why <b>we</b> <b>lack</b> whiskers and tails." [...] He also noted that nearly half of human protein-coding genes do not have homologues in fruit flies, so one could argue the opposite of Carroll's thesis and claim that [...] "evolution of form is very much a matter of teaching old genes to make new genes." ...|$|E

2500|$|This thesis targets {{a problem}} with the nature of inquiry {{originally}} postulated by Plato in Meno. Here, Plato asks about inquiry; how do we gain knowledge of a theorem in geometry? We inquire into the matter. Yet, knowledge by inquiry seems impossible. In other words, [...] "If we already have the knowledge, there is no place for inquiry. If <b>we</b> <b>lack</b> the knowledge, we don't know what we are seeking and cannot recognize it when we find it. Either way we cannot gain knowledge of the theorem by inquiry. Yet, we do know some theorems." [...] The Innate Knowledge thesis offers a solution to this paradox.

2500|$|No {{meeting of}} the {{territorial}} legislature occurred during McCord's time in office. He did however submit an annual report on September 30, 1897. The report highlighted the Arizona's need for irrigation and listed several potential dam sites. McCord also suggested the Federal government should assist in effort to build the needed infrastructure. [...] The economic section of report listed all the territory's mines and gave information on agricultural and cattle ranching industries. In addition to the sugar beets being grown near Yuma, McCord suggested tobacco and peanuts as potential new crops. In reference to Arizona's statehood effort, McCord wrote [...] "While our population is not so numerous as some might {{think it should be}} to entitle us to be intrusted with self-government, yet we claim and insist that what we make up in quality what <b>we</b> <b>lack</b> in quantity".

Those to replace them are chosen {{with a view to}} his ideal of the colony, just as a gardener tries to create through his selection his ideal garden. And, finally, to ensure that no struggle for existence between the colonists interferes with the struggle against nature, he provides them with sufficient food, housing, and so on. [...] "With every step of this progress in civilization, the colonists would become more and more independent of the state of nature; more and more, their lives would be conditioned by a state of art. In order to attain his ends, the administrator would have to avail himself of the courage, industry, and co-operative intelligence of the settlers; and it is plain that the interest of the community would be best served by increasing the proportion of persons who possess such qualities, and diminishing that of persons devoid of them.

2500|$|Rather than {{arguing for}} an {{all-inclusive}} public sphere, or {{the analysis of}} tension between public spheres, he suggested that publics were formed by active members of society around issues. They are a group of interested individuals who engage in vernacular discourse about a specific issue. [...] "Publics may be repressed, distorted, or responsible, but any evaluation of their actual state requires that we inspect the rhetorical environment {{as well as the}} rhetorical act out of which they evolved, for these are the conditions that constitute their individual character". These people formed rhetorical public spheres that were based in discourse, not necessarily orderly discourse but any interactions whereby the interested public engages each other. This interaction can take the form of institutional actors as well as the basic [...] "street rhetoric" [...] that [...] "open a dialogue between competing factions." [...] The spheres themselves formed around the issues that were being deliberated. The discussion itself would reproduce itself across the spectrum of interested publics [...] "even though <b>we</b> <b>lack</b> personal acquaintance with all but a few of its participants and are seldom in contexts where we and they directly interact, we join these exchanges because they are discussing the same matters". In order to communicate within the public sphere, [...] "those who enter any given arena must share a reference world for their discourse to produce awareness for shared interests and public opinions about them". This world consists of common meanings and cultural norms from which interaction can take place.|$|E
