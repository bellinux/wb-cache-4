40|$|ABSTRACT: Water {{and water}} vapor {{transport}} in two-layer systems where one layer acts as <b>water</b> <b>retarder</b> are analyzed. In the experimental work, four external paints {{supposed to protect}} the underlying structure against water under common service conditions are applied on glass fiber reinforced concrete substrates. The water absorption coefficient and the effective water vapor diffusion coefficient are chosen as evaluation parameters {{for the assessment of}} water and water vapor transport proper-ties of the systems. In the water absorption experiments, two consecutive quasi-steady regimes are identified, the first with an almost constant water flux into the system, and the second obeying the square-root-of-time rule for cumulative mass of water in the system. The water protective qualities of all studied paints can be considered as satisfactory for common service conditions. The effective diffusion coefficients of all systems are found to be within the error range of the measuring method compared to the substrate itself, which is a very positive feature for external paints...|$|E

40|$|Simultaneous {{experiments}} on the moisture behavior of six low-slope roof systems were {{performed in a}} climate simulator. The systems comprised a self-drying design over a conventional metal deck, a self-drying design over a significantly more permeable slotted metal deck and four others over conventional metal decks: a system typical of US construction with a liquid <b>water</b> permeable vapor <b>retarder,</b> a system typical of European construction with a liquid <b>water</b> permeable vapor <b>retarder,</b> a top-ventilated system with a polyethylene vapor retarder, and an impermeable control system with a polyethylene vapor retarder. Total weight of each test panel was measured and recorded continuously, along with temperatures and heat fluxes, to compare {{the behavior of the}} various systems. The authors imposed steady-state temperatures from hot summer to cold winter conditions to obtain the R-values of the construction dry insulations in each panel. Temperature cycles typical of hot summer days and mild winter days were then imposed above the construction dry assemblies to obtain baseline diurnal performance. The authors applied a one-dimensional thermal and hygric model. The solid and slotted deck were assumed to differ only in water vapor permeance. A model was not attempted for the top-ventilated system. The 1 -D model predicted very well the slow rates of wetting in the winter cycles and both the slow then fast rates of drying in the summer cycles before and after water addition, except it overpredicted the drying rate for the US construction with a liquid <b>water</b> permeable vapor <b>retarder...</b>|$|R
50|$|One of Sika's main market {{segments}} are admixtures and additives for the concrete industry. Concrete admixtures include <b>water</b> reducers, set <b>retarders,</b> accelerators, durability enhancers, mold release agents, curing compounds and surface retarders. Main application fields are bridges and buildings. Concrete admixtures {{are used for}} shotcrete, self-leveling concrete, precast concrete, ready-mix concrete or the water reduction in concrete.

In this project, 23 {{of the most commonly}} used concrete admixtures in New Jersey Department of Transportation construction projects were selected. These include air-entrainers, accelerators, <b>retarders,</b> <b>water</b> reducers, and other combinations of these admixtures (NJDOT Material Specifications, 2011). Admixtures can accelerate/slow the setting time, improve workability, enhance frost and sulfate resistance, and help control strength development. About 80  % of concrete produced in North America contains one or more types of admixtures (Ramachandran 1995).|$|R
40|$|Based on {{investigations}} of typical components- active components and impurities- of common concrete admixtures like <b>water</b> reducers, <b>retarders,</b> plasticizers, mobile components and mobile decomposition products of active components resulting from reactions of concrete admixtures with concentrated alkaline solutions in porous water were determined. Cement mortar and concrete samples with admixtures (admixture concentration 0. 5 and 2 % of cement con-tent) were extracted/leached with different organic solvents and aqueous solu-tions at higher temperatures. The identification and quantification of relevant compounds in initial products and extracts {{were carried out}} by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1 H NMR) {{as well as by}} gas chromatography / mass spectrometry. The obtained data prove on one hand, that concrete admixtures are detectable in concrete with the methods chosen. On the other hand the data proves, that even under “worst-case”-conditions (grounded cement bound building material and extraction/leaching at higher temperatures for more than 5 d) only minor portions of active components and impurities are mobile in water. More than 70 % of the added admixture is irreversible bound to the concrete matrix. Besides small portions of active components mainly formiate and acetate can be detected in aqueous solutions. Of the listed dangerous substances only phosphoric acid tributyl ester can be detected in aqueous extracts of concrete and cement mortar in minor traces...|$|R
40|$|Roller {{compacted}} concrete (RCC) is a drier consistency concrete proportioned with dense graded aggregates and has lesser paste content. Primarily owing to its drier consistency, the fresh and mechanical performances of RCC are distinctly different from conventional concretes. The objectives {{of this work}} were three fold. The first objective was to explain the anomalous behavior of fresh RCC in terms of different components of workability. The second objective was to explain the mechanisms of strength development in terms of paste quality and quantity. The final objective was to explain the roles of different chemical admixtures (<b>water</b> reducers, <b>retarders,</b> rheology modifiers, air entraining agents, dry cast products, etc.) in influencing the workability and strength performances of RCC. It is observed that the relative volume {{and quality of the}} paste, in addition to combined aggregate grading, affect the overall workability of mixtures. The workability of concrete is characterized in terms of cohesion, angle of internal friction, air content, compactibility, and consistency retention over time. Air content plays a decisive role in influencing the performances of concrete. The resulting mobility of the paste influences the compactibility, which in-turn decides the strength as well. RCC shows anomalous behavior in terms of mechanical strength as shown by deviations in the Abrams 2 ̆ 7 law. It is argued that water-binder ratio is not a comprehensive parameter to explain the overall concrete behavior and trends. A significant body of knowledge is added in terms of the use of chemical admixtures in RCC. Atypical behaviors in influencing the fresh and hardened properties are explained by offering plausible mechanisms in terms of binder-admixture interactions. Irrespective of the admixture type, higher than normal dosages are required for RCC...|$|R
30|$|This study investigates {{quantitative}} methods for assessment of infrared analysis of concrete admixtures using correlation coefficients by performing IR scans following the ASTM C 494 /C 494 M- 11 specifications. In {{order to achieve}} this goal, numerous IR scans were performed on specimens supplied by the manufacturer from different batches to ensure uniformity and equivalency. These scans were then analyzed to create correlation coefficients for each admixture. The correlation coefficients were used to quantitatively evaluate and interpret IR Scans of job samples. The study focused on 23 most commonly used concrete admixtures by the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT). They include air-entrainers, accelerators, <b>retarders,</b> <b>water</b> reducers, and other combinations of these admixtures. Their correlation coefficients were established by analyzing a total of 12 scans of each admixture from three different batches supplied by the manufacturer at different time intervals. In order to validate the obtained correlation coefficients and establish a target correlation, job samples were tested and compared to the obtained correlations. The study also evaluated the effects of drying time and using different types of KBr on correlation coefficients.|$|R
40|$|Use of roller {{compacted}} concrete (RCC) for pavement applications {{is growing in}} the United States. This material offers great technical and economic benefits, however there is insufficient research done to understand it better. The drier consistency and lack of adequate paste in RCC makes its fresh behavior very different from other types of concretes. This also leads to challenges in characterizing its properties adequately to be translated to practice. The use of chemical admixture in RCC has not been studied in detail before and hence there is an apprehension in using them. What further aggravates {{the problem is the}} use of multiple mixing technologies used in producing RCC. This research attempts to resolve some of these problems. The workability of concrete is considered to be constituted by the cohesion, compactibility, and segregation resistance, retention of workability, water reduction and consistency. Each of these properties was characterized using a test method. These include the use of vibrated slump test, direct shear test as used in soils, and gyratory compaction test as used in asphalt industry. Furthermore, ten most widely used chemical admixtures were tested in a typical RCC mixture. These include <b>water</b> reducers, <b>retarders,</b> air entraining agents and dry cast industry products. For each of these product types, different chemical formulations were selected to evaluate the comparative performances. It is observed that individually each admixture offers distinct benefits and improves different properties of fresh RCC including changing the setting behavior and finishibility. Moreover, for a given mixture, the improvement in workability is a composite function of its components viz. cohesion, compactibility, consistency, water reduction, admixture type and dosage. Finally, a set of recommendations are offered along with some precautions to be taken in using these admixtures individually. It is anticipated that this work will lead to the better characterization of different properties of RCC and use of chemical admixtures with greater confidence...|$|R
40|$|Magnesium {{potassium}} phosphate cement (MKPC) {{is a kind}} of cementitious binder in which the chemical bond is formed via a heterogeneous acid-base reaction between dead burned magnesia powder and {{potassium phosphate}} solution at room temperature. Small amount of boron compounds can be incorporated in the cement as a setting retarder. The final reaction product of MgO-KH 2 PO 4 -H 2 O ternary system is identified as magnesium potassium phosphate hexahydrate, MgKPO 4 · 6 H 2 O. However, the mechanisms and procedures through which this crystalline product is formed and the conditions under which the crystallization process would be influenced are not yet clear. Understanding of the reaction mechanism of the system is helpful for developing new methodologies to control the rapid reaction process and furthermore, to adjust the phase assemblage of the binder, and to enhance the macroscopic properties. This study is mainly focused on the examination of the reaction mechanism of MKPC. In addition, the formulation optimization, microstructure characterization and field application in rapid repair are also systematically studied. The chemical reactions between magnesia and potassium dihydrogen phosphate are essentially an acid-base reaction with strong heat release, the pH and temperature variation throughout the reaction process could provide useful information to disclose the different stages in the reaction. However, {{it would be very difficult}} to conduct such tests on the cement paste due to the limited water content and fast setting. In the current research, the reaction mechanism of MKPC is investigated on the diluted MKPC system through monitoring the pH and temperature development, identification of the solid phase formed, and measurement of the ionic concentration of the solution. The reaction process can be explained as follows: when magnesia and potassium phosphate powder are mixed with water, phosphate is readily dissolved, which is instantly followed by the dissociation of magnesia. With the increase of magnesium ions in the solution, MgHPO 4 · 7 H 2 O is the first product precipitated, and its crystallization is accompanied with the increase of both pH and temperature. Beyond pH of 7, MgHPO 4 · 7 H 2 O is transformed to Mg 2 KH(PO 4) 2 · 15 H 2 O, leading to a slight decrease of pH. The following dramatic increase of pH may be due to the formation of Mg 2 KH(PO 4) 2 · 15 H 2 O. Finally, Mg 2 KH(PO 4) 2 · 15 H 2 O gradually transforms to MgKPO 4 · 6 H 2 O and leads to the second decrease of pH. Both increasing molar ratio of magnesium to phosphate (M/P) and decreasing the weight ratio of liquid to solid can speed up the reaction rate while addition of small amount of boron compounds can prolong the process even though the products are not changed. The retarding mechanism of boron compounds is related to their buffering effect on the pH of the solution, i. e. decreasing pH development rate, leads to delaying the formation of reaction products. The performance of MKPC based cementitious materials can be significantly influenced by M/P molar ratio, addition of setting <b>retarder,</b> <b>water</b> content, fly ash replacement of magnesia and aggregate usage. Therefore, the formulation of MKPC based materials is optimized in terms of workability, compressive strength, and cost consideration. With optimized formulation, MKPC mortars show high early compressive and flexural strength, superior bond strength to ordinary Portland cement mortar/concrete substrate, and low drying shrinkage. Undoubtedly, the mechanical properties of this cement is closely related to its inner composition and microstructure. The microstructure examination shows that the phase assemblage and the morphology characteristics of MKPC paste vary with the different formulae. In the formulation with lower M/P ratio of 2, KH 2 PO 4 residues can be found in a flat, smooth, and bulky mass form. The reaction product MgKPO 4 · 6 H 2 O, can be observed as acicular crystal habit with large aspect ratio of 30. With the increase of M/P ratio, MgKPO 4 · 6 H 2 O is crystallized in a larger size and the morphology is changed from acicular to bladed and then prismatic shape. The magnesia residues can be well identified in all of the formulations...|$|R
