500|$|Putnam's obverse {{features}} Moses Cleaveland, in a depiction {{based on}} the only known portrait of him, by an unknown artist. Surrounding Cleaveland are two lines of inscription, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA * HALF DOLLAR and MOSES CLEAVELAND * LIBERTY. The designer's initials, [...] "PB", are beneath Cleaveland's head. The reverse shows {{a map of the}} Great Lakes region with nine stars to represent its cities: Cleveland, Buffalo, Chicago, Detroit, Duluth, Milwaukee, Rochester, Toledo and Toronto. Cleveland gets the largest star, which is transfixed by a compass. Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen, in their book on commemoratives, stated that [...] "we have not found documentation, but <b>we</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> the compass was intended to show Cleveland as the center of industry within a radius of approximately 900 miles", thus encompassing, the authors suggested, not only the Great Lakes cities represented, but New York, Boston, Washington, and St. Louis. The other inscriptions required by law appear in the upper right of the reverse, and 1836 GREAT LAKES EXPOSITION 1936 CLEVELAND CENTENNIAL surround the map.|$|E
500|$|Judaism arguably {{does not}} require uncompromising {{obedience}} to religious authority; the case has been made that throughout Jewish history rabbis have circumvented laws they found unconscionable, such as capital punishment. Similarly, although an occupation with national destiny has been central to the Jewish faith (see Zionism) many scholars (including Moses Mendelssohn) stated that conscience as a personal revelation of scriptural truth was an important adjunct to the Talmudic tradition. The concept of inner light in the Religious Society of Friends or Quakers is associated with conscience. Freemasonry describes itself as providing an adjunct to religion and key symbols found in a Freemason Lodge are the square and compasses explained as providing lessons that Masons should [...] "square their actions by the square of conscience", learn to [...] "circumscribe their desires and keep their passions within due bounds toward all mankind." [...] The historian Manning Clark viewed conscience {{as one of the}} comforters that religion placed between man and death but also a crucial part of the quest for grace encouraged by the Book of Job and the Book of Ecclesiastes, leading us to be paradoxically closest to the truth when <b>we</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> what matters most in life ("being there when everyone suddenly understands what it has all been for") can never happen. Leo Tolstoy, after a decade studying the issue (1877â€“1887), held that the only power capable of resisting the evil associated with materialism and the drive for social power of religious institutions, was the capacity of humans to reach an individual spiritual truth through reason and conscience. Many prominent religious works about conscience also have a significant philosophical component: examples are the works of Al-Ghazali, Avicenna, Aquinas, Joseph Butler and Dietrich Bonhoeffer (all discussed in the philosophical views section).|$|E

Especially, lung cancer, breast cancer and melanoma often bring out bone metastasis. However, she had no symptoms and no findings in CT and PET-CT with which <b>we</b> should <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> she had lung cancer. In addition, she had no symptom in breast and there was no specific observation with which <b>we</b> should <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> she had breast cancer. There was no specific findings in peripheral blood test with which <b>we</b> should <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> she had some hematological disease, although we did not perform bone puncture. Furthermore, there was no specific findings in her skin in the whole body with which <b>we</b> should <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> she had some disease such as melanoma.|$|R
2500|$|Critics in the Southwest Journal of Pulmonary & Critical Care said, [...] "the present Choosing Wisely {{campaign}} has fundamental flawsnot {{because it is}} medically wrong but because it attempts to replace choice and good judgment with a rigid set of rules that undoubtedly will have many exceptions. Based on {{what we have seen}} so far, <b>we</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> Choosing Wisely is much more about saving money than improving patient care. We also predict it will be used by the unknowing or unscrupulous to further interfere with the doctor-patient relationship." ...|$|E

Another glance and another thrill, and we spring into each other's arms. What can be more natural? ...|$|E
6000|$|The letter {{before us}} {{does not answer}} these inquiries. Its main feature is the strong {{expression}} of the uncertainty and awe that pervaded even the firm hearts of the Old Congress, while anticipating the struggle which was to ensue. [...] "The commencement of hostilities," [...] it says, [...] "is exceedingly dreaded here. It is thought that an attack upon the troops, even should it prove successful, would certainly involve the whole continent in a war. It is generally thought that the Ministry would rejoice at a rupture in Boston, because it would furnish an excuse to the people at home" [...] [this was the last time, <b>we</b> <b>suspect,</b> <b>that</b> John Adams spoke of England thus affectionately], [...] "and unite them in an opinion {{of the necessity of}} pushing hostilities against us." ...|$|E
30|$|There {{are some}} reports that {{estrogen}} contributes to hemangioma enlargement [10, 11]. Our case occurred after menopause {{in the absence}} of estrogen intake. However, the patient received oral prostaglandin E 1, which contains a platelet aggregation inhibitor, to treat spinal canal stenosis and underwent hemodialysis. <b>We</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> the patient developed Kasabach-Merritt syndrome due to the enlargement of tumor with tendency to bleed.|$|R
30|$|Growth of this tumor is very rapid, precluding {{surgical}} resection in many patients. The {{tumor in}} our patient was resected because <b>we</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> it was an early stage cancer. At resection, the tumor was three times as large as in the initial image taken 1 Â month earlier. Had we waited the normal 1 â€“ 2 months, the tumor {{could not have been}} resected.|$|R
30|$|Diagnosing this {{condition}} {{is difficult because}} of its rarity. <b>We</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> {{the cause of the}} splenic infarction in this patient was torsion or an embolism. However, we also investigated the cause of her thrombophilia, including protein C and S activities, lupus anticoagulant, and anti-cardiolipin antibodies; all these parameters were within normal ranges (data not shown). The final diagnosis of splenic torsion was based on intraoperative findings.|$|R
60|$|Jarwin was by {{no means}} devoid of courage. Many a time, in days gone by, when his good ship was tossing on the stormy sea, or {{scudding}} under bare poles, had he stood on the deck with unshaken confidence and a calm heart, but now he was {{face to face with the}} seaman's most dreaded enemy--"breakers ahead!"--nay, worse, breakers around him everywhere, save at that one narrow passage, which appeared so small, and so involved in the general turmoil, as to afford scarcely an element of hope. For the first time in his life Jarwin's heart sank within him--at least so he said in after years while talking of the event--but <b>we</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> John was underrating himself. At all events, he showed no symptoms of fear as he sat there calmly awaiting his fate.|$|E
6000|$|In {{our survey}} of the lively {{discussion}} which has been raised, it matters little how our own particular opinions may incline. But we may confess to an impression, thus far, that {{the doctrine of the}} permanent and complete immutability of species has not been established, and may fairly be doubted. We believe that species vary, and that [...] "Natural Selection" [...] works; but <b>we</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> its operation, like every analogous natural operation, may be limited by something else. Just as every species by its natural rate of reproduction would soon completely fill any country it could live in, but does not, being checked by some other species or some other condition--so it may be surmised that variation and natural selection have their struggle and consequent check, or are limited by something inherent in the constitution of organic beings.|$|E
60|$|They {{stood with}} the fire between them, both silent, both aware, each in his own way, of the {{importance}} of the passing minutes. Babalatchi's fatalism gave him only an insignificant relief in his suspense, because no fatalism can kill the thought of the future, the desire of success, the pain of waiting for the disclosure of the immutable decrees of Heaven. Fatalism is born of the fear of failure, for we all believe that we carry success in our own hands, and <b>we</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> our hands are weak. Babalatchi looked at Willems and congratulated himself upon his ability to manage that white man. There was a pilot for Abdulla--a victim to appease Lingard's anger in case of any mishap. He would take good care to put him forward in everything. In any case let the white men fight it out amongst themselves. They were fools. He hated them--the strong fools--and knew that for his righteous wisdom was reserved the safe triumph.|$|E
40|$|A right atrial and {{inferior}} vena caval thrombus in a structurally normal {{heart is}} a very rare condition. We report a case of such a thrombus in a 66 -year-old woman.

30|$|The Radical- 7 with RRaâ„¢ enables noninvasive, reproducible, and {{continuous}} acoustic respiratory rate and SpO 2 monitoring measurements. Mimoz et al. showed that continuous RM using the acoustic device correlated well with capnometry [16]. At our institution, all medical staff {{have access to}} patient data including SpO 2 and respiratory rate from bedside device screens {{as well as the}} central screen at the nursesâ€™ stations. Staff can also monitor alarms via smart devices that are connected to the in-hospital network. Neither of the patients with life-threatening respiratory events had preoperative cardiovascular disease. Intraoperative and postoperative electrocardiogram and blood pressure prior to the event were within normal limits. Thus, <b>we</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> the life-threatening respiratory events were due to RD. Moreover, <b>we</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> the life-threatening respiratory events were caused by opioid and opioid with residual neuromuscular blockade because of their rapid recovery without any complications and absence of other reasons for these events. In these types of cases, a continuous respiratory monitoring system such as that used in our study would be useful in the early detection of severe respiratory events.|$|R

60|$|Among the children, if we may venture so {{to class}} them, were Archie and Billie Sinclair--though <b>we</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> Archie would have claimed, {{and with some}} reason, to be classed with the men. They belonged to the camp-fire, which formed a centre to the party {{composed}} of Dan and Peter, Fergus, Dechamp, and Fred Jenkins the sailor. The latter, who it was thought had {{come out to the}} country by way of a skylark rather than as a settler, had followed the hunters, bent, he said, on firing a broadside into a buffalo. He had brought with him a blunderbuss, which he averred had been used by his great-grandfather at the battle of Culloden. It was a formidable old weapon, capable of swallowing, at one gulp, several of the bullets which fitted the trading guns of the country. Its powers of scattering ordinary shot in large quantity had proved to be very effective, and had done such execution among flocks of wild-fowl, that the Indians and half-breeds, although at first inclined to laugh at it, were ultimately filled with respect.|$|E
60|$|To {{say that}} poor Olaf's heart gave a violent leap, and then {{apparently}} ceased to beat altogether, while the blood fled from his visage, {{is not to}} say anything disparaging to his courage. Whether you be boy or man, reader, <b>we</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> if you had, in similar circumstances, beheld such a pair of eyes, you might have been troubled with somewhat similar emotions. Cowardice lies not in the susceptibility of the nervous system to a shock, but in giving way to that shock so as to become unfit for proper action or self-defence. If Olaf had been a coward, he would, forgetting all else, have attempted to fly, or, that being impossible, would have shrunk into the innermost recesses of the cave. Not being a coward, his first impulse was to start to his feet and face the pair of eyes; his second, to put his left arm round Snorro, and, still keeping his white face steadily turned to the foe, to draw the child close to his side.|$|E
6000|$|In September this year, when {{returning}} in Lord Bolingbroke's coach from Dawley, {{the poet}} was overturned {{in a little}} rivulet near Twickenhan, and nearly drowned. The unfortunate little man! One is reminded of Gulliver's accident in the Brobdignagian cream-pot. In {{trying to break the}} glasses of the coach, which were down, he severely cut his right hand, and lost the use of two of his fingers,--an addition to his other deformities not very desirable; and <b>we</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> Pope thought Voltaire (who had met him at Bolingbroke's) but a miserable comforter, when, in a letter of pretended condolence, he asked--"Is it possible that those fingers which have written 'The Rape of the Lock,' and dressed Homer so becomingly in an English coat, should have been so barbarously treated? Let the hand of Dennis or of your poetasters be cut off; yours is sacred." [...] It was perhaps in keeping that those mutilated fingers were soon to be employed in attacking Dennis, and that the embittered poet was about, with the half of his hand, but with the whole of his heart, to write [...] "The Dunciad." ...|$|E

60|$|In {{the early}} part of the first Berlin residence, Pastor Primarius Lessing, hearing that his son meditated a {{movement}} on Vienna, was much exercised with fears of the temptation to Popery he would be exposed to in that capital. <b>We</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> the attraction thitherward had its source in a perhaps equally catholic, but less theological magnet,--the Mademoiselle Lorenz above mentioned. Let us remember the perfectly innocent passion of Mozart for an actress, and be comforted. There is not the slightest evidence that Lessing's life at this time, or any other, though careless, was in any way debauched. No scandal was ever coupled with his name, nor is any biographic chemistry needed to bleach spots out of his reputation. What cannot be said of Wieland, of Goethe, of Schiller, of Jean Paul, may be safely affirmed of this busy and single-minded man. The parental fear of Popery brought him a seasonable supply of money from home, which enabled him to clothe himself decently enough to push his literary fortunes, and put on a bold front with publishers. Poor enough he often was, but never in so shabby a pass that he was forced to write behind a screen, like Johnson.|$|E
60|$|What other {{letters from}} Cicero we possess were written almost {{exclusively}} {{with the view}} of keeping the army together, and continuing the contest against Antony. There are among them a few introductory letters of little or no interest. And these military despatches, though of importance as showing the eager nature of the man, seem, as we read them, to be foreign to his nature. He does not understand war, and devotes himself to instigating men to defend the Republic, of whom <b>we</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> they {{were not in the}} least affected by the words they received from him. The correspondence as to this period of his life consists of his letters to the Generals, and of theirs to him. There are nearly as many of the one as of the other, and the reader is often inclined to doubt whether Cicero be writing to Plancus or Plancus to Cicero. He remained at Rome, and we can only imagine him as busy among the official workshops of the State, writing letters, scraping together money for the troops, struggling in vain to raise levies, amid a crowd of hopeless, doubting, disheartened Senators, whom he still kept together by his eloquence as Republicans, though each was eager to escape.|$|E
6000|$|Now, really, {{although}} we are bound {{to admit that the}} Doctor's opinion is of great weight, we cannot, without a humble protest, allow ourselves to be thus ruthlessly stripped of all our romantic notions in regard to the [...] "king of beasts"! <b>We</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> the Doctor, disgusted with the [...] "twaddle" [...] that has undoubtedly been talked in all ages about the [...] "magnanimity" [...] of the [...] "noble" [...] lion and his [...] "terrific aspect," [...] has been led unintentionally to underrate him. In this land we have opportunities of seeing and hearing the lion in his captive state; and we think that most readers will sympathise with us when we say that even in a cage he has at least a very grand and noble aspect; and that, when about to be fed, his intermittent growls and small roars, so to speak, have something very awful and impressive, which nothing like the bellowing of a bull can at all equal. To say that the roar of the ostrich is equal to that of the lion is no argument at all; it does not degrade the latter, it merely exalts the former. And further, in regard to aspect, the illustrations in Dr Livingstone's own most interesting work go far to prove that the lion is magnificent in appearance.|$|E
