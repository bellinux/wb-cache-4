5|$|These {{and other}} {{differences}} reflect the differing design {{goals of the}} two buses: USB <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> simplicity and low cost, while FireWire <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> high performance, particularly in time-sensitive applications such as audio and video. Although similar in theoretical maximum transfer rate, FireWire400 is faster than USB2.0 high-bandwidth in real-use, especially in high-bandwidth use such as external hard drives. The newer FireWire800 standard is {{twice as fast as}} FireWire400 and faster than USB2.0 high-bandwidth both theoretically and practically. However, FireWire's speed advantages rely on low-level techniques such as direct memory access (DMA), which in turn have created opportunities for security exploits such as the DMA attack.|$|E
5|$|A {{drawback}} {{of carrying}} WE.177 on external pylons was a limitation due to aerodynamic heating of the bomb's casing. WE.177A {{was limited to}} a maximum carriage time of five minutes at Mach 1.15 at low level on TSR-2, otherwise the bomb's temperature would rise above its permitted maximum. This would impose a severe operational restriction on TSR-2, as the aircraft <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> M=1+ cruise at this height.|$|E

5|$|Darjeeling {{has seen}} a {{significant}} growth in its population, its decadal growth rate being 47% between 1991 and 2001. The colonial town <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> a population of only 10,000, and subsequent growth has created extensive infrastructural and environmental problems. The district's forests and other natural wealth have been adversely affected by an ever-growing population.|$|E
5|$|Fragile Allegiance {{generally}} scored {{well with}} reviewers, with PC Gamer UK giving {{the game the}} Game of Distinction award and it was praised for its graphics, interface and sound.

5|$|The first railway {{hotels in}} London {{were built in}} Euston. Two hotels {{designed}} by Hardwick opened in 1839, located {{either side of the}} Arch; the Victoria on the west had basic facilities while the Euston on the east <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> first-class passengers.|$|E
5|$|The house {{known as}} the Jesse Ashbridge house {{was built on the}} family's land {{beginning}} in 1854. The house <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> Sarah's grandson and Jonathan's son, Jesse Ashbridge, by prominent local architect, Joseph Sheard, who many years later would later serve as Mayor of Toronto. The cottage was designed in the Regency style, built with red brick laid in a Flemish bond, with a hipped roof and treillage veranda. Jesse married in 1864 and died in 1874.|$|E

5|$|The new building, also {{designed}} by Cyril Bazett Tubbs, <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> attractiveness and modernity to {{contrast with the}} traditional gloomy decor associated with the funeral industry. A narrow four-storey office building stood at 188 Westminster Bridge Road. The ground floor was taken up by a large arch leading to a waiting room, an office for general enquiries, and the long driveway leading to the station itself; above this were the LNC's offices and boardrooms.|$|E
5|$|USS Indiana (BB-1) was {{the lead}} ship of her class and the first {{battleship}} in the United States Navy comparable to foreign battleships of the time. Authorized in 1890 and commissioned five years later, she was a small battleship, though with heavy armor and ordnance. The ship also pioneered {{the use of an}} intermediate battery. She <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> coastal defense and as a result, her decks were not safe from high waves on the open ocean.|$|E
5|$|A {{meeting was}} held {{after the service}} and a {{detailed}} restoration plan was announced at the meeting along with a list for those wishing to donate to the work. The Prince of Wales (later Edward VII) and the Marquess of Bute were among those who pledged donations sufficient to allow the restoration work to continue immediately. The cathedral was extensively restored, the tower rebuilt and a spire added. Much of the restoration work was completed by local architect John Prichard between 1843 and 1869. A triptych by Dante Gabriel Rossetti <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> use as a reredos, and a new stained glass window, Shipwreck of St Paul, was designed by Ford Madox Brown. Sir Edward Burne-Jones designed the porcelain panels Six Days of Creation in St Dyfrig's Chapel.|$|E
50|$|Initially, Electric Track Vehicle systems <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> {{documents}} {{transport and}} mail distribution in {{office buildings and}} headquarters.

Orthopedic shoes are special types of footwear <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> individuals with particular foot problems or special needs. Other animals, such as dogs and horses, may also wear special shoes to protect their feet as well.|$|R
5|$|A {{photograph}} of the building that was to house the theater appeared in The Morning Oregonian newspaper in 1913.

The second floor was intended for residential rooms and apartments, and the ground floor <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> business storerooms and a movie theater. According to a February 1915 newspaper advertisement, The Exploits of Elaine, {{the first in a}} continuing series of Craig Kennedy detective stories, was to show at The Clinton on March 1.|$|E
5|$|A steel corset in the Stibbert Museum, Florence, Italy, is {{dated to}} the mid-16th century, and {{thought to be}} similar to the metal stays {{recorded}} as having been made by a corazzaio mastro (master armour-maker) for Eleanor of Toledo and delivered to her on 28 February 1549. However, as Eleanor's wardrobe records do not list any boned or stiffened corsets, it is thought that her steel bodice <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> medical or therapeutic reasons rather than worn as a fashionable garment.|$|E
5|$|Although {{visually}} {{similar to}} Rare's family-oriented Nintendo 64 platform games Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64, Conker's Bad Fur Day <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> mature audiences and features graphic violence, {{alcohol and tobacco}} use, profanity, vulgar humor and pop culture references. It was developed {{over the course of}} four years and was originally intended for a family audience, but was ultimately retooled into its current form because previews were criticised for being both too cute and similar to Rare's earlier platform games.|$|E

5|$|By the mid-1890s {{the station}} {{entrance}} had {{been incorporated into}} a larger building. In 1922, a new entrance and canopy <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> the Bridge Street entrance by Charles Holden and, in 1924, he designed a plainly rendered replacement elevation for the eastern entrance on to the Embankment. These were {{the first of many}} projects by the architect for the London Electric Railway (the main forerunner of London Transport and Transport for London). The station platforms were also refurbished with new wall tiling in the green, blue, black and white tiling scheme used later by Holden on many stations of the period and still visible at neighbouring St James's Park station. In 1949, the Metropolitan line-operated Inner Circle route was given its own identity on the tube map as the Circle line.|$|E
5|$|Calabria <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> use in Italy's colonial empire, {{rather than}} the earlier vessels {{intended}} as fleet scouts. As such, her steel hull was sheathed with wood and then a layer of zinc {{to protect it from}} fouling during lengthy tours in the overseas colonies. Additionally, she was equipped with less powerful though more efficient engines than the earlier cruisers. The ship was otherwise similar to preceding designs like the Regioni class, having a displacement only slightly lower and a nearly identical gun battery.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea {{have only}} had one home ground, Stamford Bridge, where they have played since the team's foundation. It was officially opened on 28 April 1877 {{and for the first}} 28 years of its {{existence}} it was used almost exclusively by the London Athletic Club as an arena for athletics meetings and not at all for football. In 1904 the ground was acquired by businessman Gus Mears and his brother Joseph, who had also purchased nearby land (formerly a large market garden) with the aim of staging football matches on the now 12.5acre (51,000m²) site. Stamford Bridge <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> the Mears family by the noted football architect Archibald Leitch, who had also designed Ibrox, Craven Cottage and Hampden Park. Most football clubs were founded first, and then sought grounds in which to play, but Chelsea were founded for Stamford Bridge.|$|E

50|$|MATILDA {{comes in}} many {{different}} models such as Urban Warrior, Block 2, and Scout Model. Each of these models <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> a specific situation. The Urban Warrior <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> military use {{when it comes to}} aggressive situations such as bomb control, drone control, and rugged terrain. The Block 2 model <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> a more tactical use for law enforcement and the fire department. This model is a jack of traits; it comes with the technology to be aggressive to a certain extent, but also comes with the ability to do reconnaissance. The scout model <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> pure reconnaissance and surveillance. This model is often used in the battlefield to get information or infiltrate enemy bases.|$|R
