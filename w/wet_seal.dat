40|$|Centrifugal {{compressors}} {{are widely}} used in production and transmission of natural gas. Seals on the rotating shafts prevent the high-pressure natural gas from escaping the compressor casing. Traditionally, these seals used highpressure oil as a barrier against escaping gas. Natural Gas STAR partners have found that replacing these “wet ” (oil) seals with dry seals significantly reduces operating costs and methane emissions. Methane emissions from <b>wet</b> <b>seals</b> typically range from 40 to 200 standard cubic feet per minute (scfm). Most of these emissions occur when the circulating oil is stripped of the gas it absorbs at the high-pressure seal face.

40|$|A {{laboratory}} experiment {{was designed to}} assess the impact of surface seal development on herbicide loss from a clay soil. The influence of surface sealing on herbicide loss through vertical macropores and lateral throughflow pathways was of particular interest. Losses of the phenylurea herbicide, isoproturon, increased from 0. 025 % to 0. 5 % of the total applied under sealed compared with unsealed conditions, as a result of two different mechanisms. First, an increased flow rate through the A horizon under the <b>wetter,</b> <b>sealed</b> conditions resulted in earlier initiation of, and hence a greater volume of, throughflow containing isoproturon in the lysimeters. Second, increased concentrations of isoproturon in macropore and throughflow under the sealed treatments were attributed to the physical and chemical characteristics of the surface seal. Localized reductions in infiltration capacity, changes in soil composition, and decrease in diffusion depth of herbicide within the surface seal are presented as possible mechanisms by which herbicide losses from the sealed soil lysimeters were enhanced...|$|R

40|$|Short-term {{changes of}} soil {{condition}} {{are one of}} the major obstacles to effective dynamic event-based erosion prediction. However, effective process-based erosion modelling is essential to 1) predict the impact of changing environmental conditions without long-term monitoring, 2) simulate extreme events, and 3) assess the off-site effects of low magnitude events. The poor performance of process-based erosion models is largely attributed to a lack of integration of the short-term (minutes to days) interaction between climate and soil resistance to erosion (erodibility). Erodibility comprises the effects of surface roughness, resistance to detachment, entrainment, and transport on erosion. During a growing season, erodibility of agricultural soil changes both within and between storms, reflecting the effects of <b>wetting,</b> <b>seal</b> formation, compaction, erosion, and drying on soil moisture, soil structure, and surface morphology. Due to the complex nature of short-term soil-climate interaction, no physical model to assess erodibility has been developed, and is unlikely to be available for practical purposes in the forseeable future.

Our present study provides a comprehensive database on the occurrence of sickle cell trait in the Manipuri population {{especially with regard to}} Manipuri Muslims, as till date no work has been done on Manipuri Muslims with different castes. AimTo study the gene frequency and heterozygosity condition of sickle cell trait in different populations of Manipur. Subjects and methodsWe have undertaken a survey of the frequencies of sickle cell gene among Muslims with different castes, viz., Sheikh, Syed, Pathan and Moghul; Hindu (Meitei) and tribe (Naga). The blood samples were collected by finger-prick method and were tested for sickle cell trait by the <b>wet</b> <b>sealed</b> method using 2 % freshly prepared sodium metabisulphite solution following the method of Daland and Castle. ResultsThe Moghul population shows the highest allele frequency of sickle cell gene, i. e., 16. 96 % while Naga shows the least, i. e., 8. 6 %. Females show a higher allele frequency of the sickle cell gene, i. e., 29. 83 % than males who show a frequency of 21. 99 %. The heterozygosity condition was found to be higher among Mughals, i. e., 28. 12 % while the least is exhibited by Naga, i. e., 15. 72 %. Higher percentage of sickle cell trait in this region might be resulting from the natural selection process in response to the high prevalence of malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) in Manipur to protect the inhabitants from the lethal effects of malaria...|$|R
