5|$|Due to {{its status}} an {{international}} language, English is expeditious {{when it comes}} adopting foreign words, and borrows vocabulary from {{a large number of}} other sources. Early studies of English vocabulary by lexicographers, the scholars who formally study vocabulary, compile dictionaries, or both, were impeded by a lack of comprehensive data on actual vocabulary in use from good-quality linguistic corpora, collections of actual written texts and spoken passages. Many statements published {{before the end of the}} 20th century about the growth of English vocabulary over time, the dates of first use of various <b>words</b> <b>in</b> <b>English,</b> and the sources of English vocabulary will have to be corrected as new computerised analysis of linguistic corpus data becomes available.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the ways}} Zamenhof made Esperanto easier to learn than ethnic {{languages}} was by creating a regular and highly productive derivational morphology. Through the judicious use of lexical affixes (prefixes suffixes), the core vocabulary needed for communication was greatly reduced, making Esperanto a more agglutinative language than most European languages. It {{has been estimated that}} on average one root in Esperanto is the communicative equivalent of ten <b>words</b> <b>in</b> <b>English.</b>|$|E
25|$|The High German {{consonant}} shift altered {{a number}} of consonants in the southern German dialects – and thus also in modern Standard German, Yiddish, and Luxembourgish – and so explains why many German words have different consonants from the obviously related <b>words</b> <b>in</b> <b>English,</b> Dutch and the Scandinavian languages. The term is sometimes {{used to refer to}} a core group of nine individual consonant modifications. Alternatively, it may encompass other phonological changes {{that took place in the}} same period.|$|E

25|$|Basic French and Spanish {{vocabulary}} {{are taught}} throughout the series. In Madeline and the Magnificent Puppet Show: A Learning Journey, the player can click on objects to hear <b>words</b> <b>in</b> <b>English,</b> French, and Spanish and review vocabulary by {{playing a game}} of Concentration. In Madeline European Adventures, the player can learn up to 100 words in both Spanish and French, {{as well as more}} information about European countries, flags, and culture through an interactive map, through skill-building activities that can be repeated at will. Throughout the series, the gameplay includes references to European culture, as well as foreign languages.|$|E
25|$|Some other layouts {{have also}} been {{designed}} specifically for use with mobile devices. The FITALY layout is optimised for use with a stylus by placing {{the most commonly used}} letters closest to the centre and thus minimising the distance travelled when entering words. A similar concept was followed to research and develop the MessagEase keyboard layout for fast text entry with stylus or finger. The ATOMIK layout, designed for stylus use, was developed by IBM using the Metropolis Algorithm to mathematically minimize the movement necessary to spell <b>words</b> <b>in</b> <b>English.</b> The ATOMIK keyboard layout is an alternative to QWERTY in ShapeWriter's WritingPad software. ASETNIOP is a keyboard layout designed for tablet computers that uses 10 input points, eight of them on the home row.|$|E
25|$|In 1851, William {{returned}} to London {{with his wife}} and two children (Frederick and Louise), on the occasion of The Great Exhibition. For the first time, Victoria met her future husband and, despite the age difference (she was eleven years old and he was nineteen), they got along very well. To promote the contact between the two, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert asked their daughter to guide Frederick through the exhibition, and during the visit the princess was able to converse in perfect German, while the prince was only able to say a few <b>words</b> <b>in</b> <b>English.</b> The meeting was therefore a success, and, years later, Prince Frederick would recall the positive impression that Victoria made on him during this visit, with her mixture of innocence, intellectual curiosity and simplicity.|$|E

500|$|English, besides forming {{new words}} from {{existing}} words and their roots, also borrows words from other languages. This process of adding words from other languages is commonplace in many world languages, but English is characterised as being especially open to borrowing of foreign words throughout the last 1,000 years. The {{most commonly used}} <b>words</b> <b>in</b> <b>English</b> are West Germanic. The <b>words</b> <b>in</b> <b>English</b> learned first by children as they learn to speak, particularly the grammatical words that dominate the word count of both spoken and written texts, are the Germanic words inherited from the earliest periods {{of the development of}} Old English.|$|E

2500|$|The non-syllabic diacritic is {{only used}} when necessary. It is {{typically}} omitted {{when there is}} no ambiguity, as in [...] No <b>words</b> <b>in</b> <b>English</b> have the vowel sequences , so the non-syllabic diacritic is unnecessary.|$|E

2500|$|A {{variant of}} unknown origin, called [...] "Abbot and Costello do Hebrew," [...] is {{popular in the}} Jewish American community.

2500|$|Transliteration assumes two {{different}} script systems. The {{use of a}} French <b>word</b> <b>in</b> <b>English</b> without translation, such as [...] "bourgeois" [...] is not transliteration. The use of a Hindi <b>word</b> <b>in</b> <b>English</b> such as [...] "khaki" [...] (originally खाकी) is transliteration. Transliteration of a foreign word into another language is usually the exception to translation, and often occurs when there is something distinctive about the <b>word</b> <b>in</b> the original language, such as a double entendre, uniqueness, religious, cultural or political significance, or it may occur to add local flavour.|$|R
5000|$|The {{spelling}} of the <b>word</b> <b>in</b> <b>English</b> {{has other}} variations including Soubik, Sowvik, Showvick, Sauvik, Souvik, Saubhik, Shouvik, Souvick, Shauvik, Shoubhik, Soubhik, Shouvick, Shouvick [...]etc ...|$|R
2500|$|The above {{three are}} the most common of auxiliaries, and the [...] "least marked", or [...] "lexically nearly colourless". The nuance {{conveyed}} by an auxiliary can often be very subtle, and need not always be expressed with different <b>words</b> <b>in</b> <b>English</b> translation. lenā and denā, transitive verbs, occur with transitives, while intransitive jānā occurs mostly with intransitives; a compound of a transitive and jānā will be grammatically intransitive as jānā is.|$|E

Grawp is about [...] tall, which Hagrid claims is small for a giant. His knuckles are the size of cricket balls (~225mm in circumference). The other giants were bullying Grawp, {{and this is a}} factor in Hagrid’s decision to bring him to the Forbidden Forest. Big and dim, he only knows a few <b>words</b> <b>in</b> <b>English</b> and his manners are wild and unpredictable.|$|E

2500|$|Because of the {{widespread}} use of dictionaries in schools, and their acceptance by many as language authorities, their treatment of the language does affect usage to some degree, with even the most descriptive dictionaries providing conservative continuity. In the long run, however, the meanings of <b>words</b> <b>in</b> <b>English</b> are primarily determined by usage, and the language is being changed and created every day. As Jorge Luis Borges says in the prologue to [...] "El otro, el mismo": [...] "It is often forgotten that (dictionaries) are artificial repositories, put together well after the languages they define. The roots of language are irrational and of a magical nature." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{spelling}} of English {{continues to}} evolve. Many loanwords come from languages where the pronunciation of vowels {{corresponds to the}} way they were pronounced in Old English, which is similar to the Italian or Spanish pronunciation of the vowels, and is the value the vowel symbols [...] and [...] have in the International Phonetic Alphabet. As a result, there is a somewhat regular system of pronouncing [...] "foreign" [...] <b>words</b> <b>in</b> <b>English,</b> [...] and some borrowed words have had their spelling changed to conform to this system. For example, Hindu used to be spelled Hindoo, and the name Maria used to be pronounced like the name Mariah, but was changed to conform to this system.|$|E
2500|$|While Dryden {{had many}} admirers, {{he also had}} his share of critics, Mark Van Doren among them. [...] Van Doren complained that in {{translating}} Virgil's Aeneid, Dryden had added [...] "a fund of phrases with which he could expand any passage that seemed to him curt". [...] Dryden did not feel such expansion was a fault, arguing that as Latin is a naturally concise language it cannot be duly represented by a comparable number of <b>words</b> <b>in</b> <b>English.</b> [...] "He...recognized that Virgil 'had {{the advantage of a}} language wherein much may be comprehended in a little space' (5:329–30). [...] The 'way to please the best Judges...is not to Translate a Poet literally; and Virgil least of any other' (5:329)" ...|$|E

In Romanian, Bulgarian, and Turkish, the <b>word</b> is salam; <b>in</b> Hungarian, it is szalámi; while Spanish, French, German, and Dutch have the same word as English. The name may be derived from the Latin words [...] "salsiccia" [...] and [...] "salumen".|$|R
