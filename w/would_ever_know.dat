500|$|Uematsu was {{personally}} {{very pleased with}} the way that the soundtrack for Final Fantasy VI turned out, and has said in interviews that he felt that [...] "with the satisfaction and excitement I felt after finishing that project, I thought I had reached my primary goal, and could quit doing game music with no regrets." [...] He stated in the liner notes for Piano Collections Final Fantasy VI that he intended the music to be emotionally moving, and entreated the listener {{not to think about the}} music, but to feel it. He also feels that the title track for Final Fantasy VI was the most challenging track he has ever made. As for Final Fantasy VI Grand Finale, on the other hand, Uematsu has said that he was [...] "not satisfied with this album at all", due to the deviation it took from his original visions for the music due to his lack of personal involvement in the arrangements. Although he did not feel that the album was a poor one, saying that if he said nothing no one <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>know</b> of his dissatisfaction, he felt that it was not what he would have created if he had [...] "defend the image of each piece".|$|E
2500|$|Thurston Moore and Lee Ranaldo {{expressed}} {{on numerous}} occasions their admiration for the music of Joni Mitchell, such as this quote by Thurston Moore: [...] "Joni Mitchell! I've used elements of her songwriting and guitar playing, and no one <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>know</b> about it." [...] Additionally, as with Sonic Youth, Joni Mitchell has always used a number of alternative tunings. The band named a song after her, [...] "Hey Joni".|$|E
2500|$|Bartle idolized his clergyman {{father and}} {{displayed}} some guilt {{for not having}} followed in his profession. [...] Bartle continued to make major decisions only after deciding what his father would have done in a similar circumstance. [...] But Roe Bartle hated the penury of the clergyman's life. [...] The first time he asked a girl for a date, she rejected {{him because he was}} dressed in ill-fitting, second-hand clothes. [...] Crushed, he swore before a mirror, [...] "hand upraised", that no child of his <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>know</b> poverty. But once he had the money, he also acquired expensive hand-tailored suits.|$|E

60|$|If those ladies {{had stayed}} all day, {{and if all}} the wasps in Missouri had come and climbed up Jim's legs, nobody there <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> have <b>known</b> it but Jim and the wasps and me. There he would have sat until the ladies left.|$|R

2500|$|In 1948, {{her mother}} met a United States Air Force officer named Paul Beaulieu, from Quebec, Canada. The couple were married within a year. Beaulieu {{took over the}} raising of Priscilla, and was the only father she <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>know.</b> She took his surname {{and over the next}} few years she grew up quickly, helping to care for the growing family as her stepfather's Air Force career moved them from Connecticut to New Mexico to Maine. In her own words, she {{described}} herself during this period as [...] "a shy, pretty little girl unhappily accustomed to moving from base to base every two or three years". Priscilla later recalled that she felt uncomfortable moving so often because she never knew if she could make friends for life, or even if she would fit in with the new people she met on each move.|$|E
2500|$|Minos {{justified}} his accession as {{king and}} prayed to Poseidon for a sign. Poseidon sent a giant white bull {{out of the}} sea. Minos was committed to sacrificing the bull to Poseidon, but then decided to substitute a different bull. In rage, Poseidon cursed Pasiphaë, Minos' wife, with zoophilia. Daedalus built her a wooden cow, which she hid inside. The bull mated with the wooden cow and Pasiphaë was impregnated by the bull, giving birth to a horrible monster, again named Asterius, the Minotaur, half man half bull. Daedalus then built a complicated [...] "chamber that with its tangled windings perplexed the outward way" [...] called the Labyrinth, and Minos put the Minotaur in it. To {{make sure no one}} <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>know</b> the secret of who the Minotaur was and {{how to get out of}} the Labyrinth (Daedalus knew both of these things), Minos imprisoned Daedalus and his son, Icarus, along with the monster. Daedalus and Icarus flew away on wings Daedalus invented, but Icarus' wings melted because he flew too close to the sun. Icarus fell in the sea and drowned.|$|E
60|$|No one <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>know</b> what it {{had cost}} him to obtain these papers. No one <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>know</b> how much he had sacrificed of pride, revenge and hate {{in order to save}} a few shreds of his own party's honour.|$|E

40|$|Descartes famously {{argued that}} animals were mere machines, without thought or {{conscious}}ness. Few would now share this view. But if other animals have conscious lives, {{what are they}} like, how do they differ from ours, and how <b>would</b> we <b>ever</b> <b>know</b> anything about them? This lecture will address this question {{by looking at the}} kinds of thoughts we might share with animals, and looking at philosophical and empirical arguments for how our thoughts might differ from theirs...|$|R
5000|$|Grahn {{experienced}} {{a fair amount}} of homophobia during the odd jobs she did to earn money for school, trying to find housing, and was beat up for her butch attire. [...] "These jolts taught me everything I <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> need to <b>know</b> about the oppression of Gay people," [...] she mentioned in an interview with Tongue.|$|R
60|$|I {{leaned over}} and spoke to it. I asked it if my heart <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>know</b> love. It said it thought so.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, if you didn't ask it," [...] said Alma, [...] "I don't believe Mr. Wetmore <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>know</b> {{what the}} price of his lessons was. He has to think, when you ask him." ...|$|E
6000|$|Her first {{feelings}} had undoubtedly been {{those of}} passionate grief {{at the loss}} of him; her second thoughts were concern at her own position as the daughter of an earl. 'Oh, why, why, my unfortunate husband, did you die in my chamber at this hour!' she said piteously to the corpse. 'Why not have died in your own cottage if you would die! Then nobody <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> have <b>known</b> of our imprudent union, and no syllable would have been breathed of how I mismated myself for love of you!' ...|$|R
60|$|She was {{thinking}} of that too. It was far in the past, yet, far as it was, it was still measurable, and a faint flush crept over her face. No {{one in the world}} knew of that experience but Carl and her father. <b>Would</b> Carl's wife <b>ever</b> <b>know</b> of it? That was the thought which caused the flush.|$|R
60|$|To add a {{name in a}} private, modest way to walls {{already so}} crowded, is allowable; but to scrawl one's name, place of birth, and country, half across a wall, {{covering}} scores of names under it, is an operation which speaks for itself. No one <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> want to <b>know</b> more of a man than to see his name there and thus.|$|R
60|$|The girl watched {{these little}} creatures long and earnestly. The pool {{was all of}} the world these simple fishes <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>know.</b> They were born here, and would die here, without ever getting away from the place, or even knowing there was a much bigger world outside of it.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly Blinky reached {{behind the}} girl and gave Pan a punch. Turning, Pan saw his comrade point back. A dull red flare lighted up the sky. Fire! Pan's heart gave a leap. The Yellow Mine was burning. The crowd of {{drinkers}} and gamblers had fled before Blinky's guns. Pan was hoping that only he and Blinky <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>know</b> who had killed Dick Hardman.|$|E
60|$|It was {{characteristic}} {{of these two}} men that not {{a word about the}} adventure itself, about the terrible risks and dangers of the past few hours, was exchanged between them. The child was here and was safe, and Blakeney knew the whereabouts of St. Just--that was enough for Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, the most devoted follower, the most perfect friend the Scarlet Pimpernel <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>know.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "It's great, ain't it?" [...] he said, at last. [...] "I {{never knew}} {{the country was}} like this, an' I don't <b>know</b> that I <b>ever</b> <b>would</b> have <b>known</b> it if it hadn't been for those poet guys you're always spouting.|$|R
60|$|It {{would not}} do, Lane reflected, {{to place the}} blame wholly upon blind fathers and mothers, though indeed they were culpable. And in {{consideration}} of the subject, Lane excluded all except the better class of Middleville. It was no difficult task to understand lack of moral sense in children who were poor and unfortunate, who had to work, and get what pleasures {{they had in the}} streets. But how about the best families, where there were luxurious homes, books, education, amusement, kindness, love--all the supposed stimuli needed for the proper guidance of changeful vagrant minds? These good influences had failed. There was a greater moral abandonment than <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> be <b>known.</b>|$|R
5000|$|So closely did Vasters' Rospigliosi Cup {{resemble}} Cellini’s style, it {{is unlikely}} that the truth about the forgery <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> have been <b>known,</b> if Vasters' preliminary sketches had not been found. Vasters was a highly skilled artisan, as well as a master of replicating another artist’s style precisely. It was not until the Rospigliosi Cup was taken apart that it became clear that the cup had been assembled in ways that were not available until Vasters' own time.|$|R
6000|$|... "Stuff! It will do, and {{you must}} use it. Who <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>know</b> it? And I shall not care how blackly you show me up. I deserve it. If I {{was the cause of}} your hating love so much that you failed with your lovers on the old lines, I {{certainly}} ought to be willing to be the means of your succeeding on lines that had never been tried before." ...|$|E
60|$|This {{change from}} candle-light to morning, this recommencement {{of the same}} round of things that had {{happened}} yesterday, was a discouragement rather than a relief to Janet. She was more conscious of her chill weariness: the new light thrown on her husband's face seemed to reveal the still work that death had been doing through the night; she felt her last lingering hope that he <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>know</b> her again forsake her.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're not {{a hopeless}} invalid," [...] he assured her, earnestly. [...] "No one <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>know,</b> {{to look at}} you as you sit there, that there was {{anything}} whatever the matter. Don't you remember our money-box for the doctor? Even that will come, Ruth. The day will come, I am sure, when we shall carry you off to Vienna, or one of those great cities, and the cure will be quite easy. I believe in it, really." ...|$|E
40|$|I {{would like}} to {{introduce}} this issue by telling a story. Sometime back in 1997, I {{wrote a paper on}} a new idea for improving the response times of http requests at a Web server. The idea was to schedule the HTTP requests so as to favor requests for small files, in accordance with the well-known scheduling policy Shortest Remaining Processing Time (SRPT). The paper was rejected, for many reasons, but the review that stuck in my mind was the one that said, 2 ̆ 2 Why is this person writing about scheduling? Scheduling is dead. 2 ̆ 2 According to this reviewer, everything that <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> be <b>known</b> about scheduling was already described in the beautiful Theory of Scheduling book, written in 1967, by Conway, Maxwell, and Miller...|$|R
50|$|The life of Elizabeth and {{her female}} companions was strict and they laboured {{for much of}} the day in prayer and working for the local poor. The life proved so strict that {{eventually}} all of Elizabeth's companions left her. New recruits came and a rule of life was drawn up by Father Gaudentius. The company was called the Institute of the Holy Family. Elizabeth and the sisters received a religious habit at the hands of Father Croskell, parish priest of St. Chad's, on the Feast of the Presentation of Mary, November 21, 1852. A plaque in the Lady Chapel of St. Chad's records this event. At her clothing Elizabeth Prout received her new religious name, by which she <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> be <b>known</b> hereafter, Mother Mary Joseph of Jesus.|$|R
60|$|Glutton the Wolverine is a dweller in {{the depths}} of the Great Forests of the Far North, and it is {{doubtful}} if Peter Rabbit <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> have <b>known</b> that there is such a person but for his acquaintance with Honker the Goose, who spends his summers in the Far North, but each spring and fall stops over for a day or two in a little pond in the Green Forest, a pond Peter often visits. This acquaintance with Honker and Peter's everlasting curiosity have resulted in many strange stories. At least they have seemed strange to Peter because they have been about furred and feathered people whom Peter has never seen. And one of the strangest of these is the story of how Glutton the Wolverine got his name.|$|R
60|$|Poor George Foster now {{began to}} find out that the terrible truths which he had refused to believe were indeed great realities, and had now begun to affect himself. He {{experienced}} an awful sinking of the heart when {{it occurred to him that}} no one <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>know</b> anything about his fate, for the little boat would be sure to be found bottom up, sooner or later, and it would of course be assumed that he had been drowned.|$|E
6000|$|Two of our neighbors--two capable women, came in {{next morning}} to help, {{and in a few}} hours the windows were curtained, the linen laid out and the turkey in the oven. Under Zulime's hands the rooms bloomed into homeliness. The kitchen things fell into orderly array. Pictures took their places on the walls, little knick-knacks which had been brought from the city were set on the mantels and bookcases, and when our guests arrived they each and all exclaimed, [...] "No one <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>know</b> you'd had a fire!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{believe you}} do know {{anything}} about it;--that's all," [...] said Tom. [...] "And now there's the cab. Good-bye, mother! Good-bye, Augusta. I hope you'll be all right." [...] This alluded to the baby. [...] "Good-bye, Gertrude. I hope you'll get all right too some day." [...] This alluded to Gertrude's two lovers. Then he left them, and as he got into his cab declared to himself that {{neither of them had}} ever, or <b>would</b> <b>ever,</b> <b>know</b> anything of that special trouble which had so nearly overwhelmed himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I see; {{you thought}} I had begun a lecture!" [...] And she laughed, in perfect good humour. [...] "They tell me I speak as I talk, so I suppose I talk as I speak. But you mustn't {{put me on}} what I saw and heard in Europe. That's to be the title of an address I am now preparing, by the way. Yes, I don't depend on father any more," [...] she went on, while Ransom's sense of having said too sarcastic a thing was deepened by her perfect {{indifference}} to it. [...] "He finds his patients draw off about enough, any way. But I owe him everything; if it hadn't been for him, no one <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> have <b>known</b> I had a gift--not even myself. He started me so, once for all, that I now go alone." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{fact that}} she made {{of each of these}} two men the {{embodiment}} of a different and opposed idea did not occur to Victoria until that afternoon. Unconsciously, each had impersonated the combatants in a struggle which was going on in her own breast. Her father himself, instinctively, had chosen Austen Vane for his antagonist without knowing that she had an interest in him. <b>Would</b> Mr. Flint <b>ever</b> <b>know?</b> Or <b>would</b> the time come when she would be forced to take a side? The blood mounted to her temples as she put the question from her.|$|R
50|$|Krishnamoorthy {{is alleged}} to have a {{daughter}} Nandini (Baby Meenakshi), a school going girl. He is scared of Vasu, because if Vasu <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> come to <b>know</b> of Nandini, he would kill her. Hence, she is studying elsewhere and lives all alone under the shelter of the nuns at her convent, nor she knows about the existence of her father. Her only relation is to Jayaraman, whom she calls Ramachan, who visits her often. Jayaraman is sent to the school occasionally by Krishnamoorthy to checkout Nandini. She asks Ramachan about her father on his every visit, to which Jayaraman replies that he would bring him on his next visit.|$|R
