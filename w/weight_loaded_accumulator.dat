Osteoarthritis (OA) was induced by monosodium iodoacetate (MIA) injection into the right knee joint. Hydrogel (HG: 20, 30, and 50 [*]μL) and temperature-sensitive hydrogel containing bupivacaine (T-gel: 20, 30, and 50 [*]μL) were injected intra-articularly 14 days after MIA injection.

30|$|The {{results for}} direct <b>weight</b> <b>loading</b> {{in this study}} are {{consistent}} with the literature. A slight axial <b>weight</b> <b>load</b> resulted in a relatively large extent of axial movements. Duda et al. [6] detected in vivo interfragmentary movements up to 4  mm in patients treated with an Ilizarov frame and mobilised with direct <b>weight</b> <b>loading</b> and a maximum load of 20  kg. At the same applied load in our experimental set-up, there were axial gap movements of 3  mm. Contact of the bone ends at a plane osteotomy leads to force transmission of all of the axial applied load through the osteotomy and none through the fixator [7]. The loading cell filled the defect fully and therefore simulated an already closed osteotomy gap {{at the beginning of the}} measurement of the loading forces in the osteotomy. The forces were directly proportional to the applied axial load, and the load force was one-to-one transferred to the osteotomy.|$|R

After incorporation into carbon aerogels, the <b>weight</b> <b>loading</b> of LiBH 4 has reached 80 %.

40|$|Pregnancy {{is a major}} {{physiological}} stress of the cardiovascular system. Weight gain significantly contributes to physical limitations. This thesis examines the effects on both physical and cardiac performance of weight gain in pregnancy. Utilising cardiac power output at rest and maximal exercise, I measured the effects of (i) inert <b>weight</b> <b>loading</b> (ii) pregnancy and (iii) obesity in the non-pregnant state, to determine the acute, chronic and also reversible changes. <b>Weight</b> <b>loading</b> using a pregnancy simulator suit (“Empathy Belly”) showed reduced physical performance, whilst showing an improvement in cardiac performance, predominantly by increasing the pressure generating capacity of the heart. Additional load carriage with the “Empathy Belly” and a rucksack, showed further reduction in physical performance, but no further improvement in cardiac performance. Pregnancy revealed significant reductions in physical performance and maintenance in cardiac performance compared to the non-pregnant post-partum. Contrary to this, there were significant reductions in both physical and cardiac performance in pregnancy, compared to pre-conception. Changes in cardiac performance throughout pregnancy gradually improved, whilst there was a deterioration in overall physical performance. Obesity in the non-pregnant state, showed significant reduction in physical performance with a marked increase in cardiac performance. This was primarily driven {{by an increase in}} the flow generating capacity of the heart; the cardiac output. Inert <b>weight</b> <b>loading,</b> <b>weight</b> carriage in pregnancy and non-physiological weight gain in obesity in the non-pregnant state, all reduce physical performance. In contrast to this, both inert weight carriage and weight carriage in obesity increase cardiac performance. Acute <b>weight</b> <b>loading</b> induces an increase in pressure generating capacity, whilst chronic weight carriage leads to an increase in flow generating capacity. For the first time, I have shown that peak cardiac performance reduces in pregnancy from pre-conception, although this gradually improves throughout pregnancy and is likely to be in part caused by an increase in weight gain. ...|$|R
50|$|The myth started around 1984 when {{comparing}} the Apple II with the IBM PC. The argument {{was that the}} PC was five {{times faster than the}} Apple II, as its Intel 8088 processor had a clock speed roughly 5x the clock speed of the MOS Technology 6502 used in the Apple. However, what really matters is not how finely divided a machine's instructions are, but {{how long it takes to}} complete a given task. Consider the LDA # (<b>Load</b> <b>Accumulator</b> Immediate) instruction. On a 6502 that instruction requires two clock cycles, or 2 μs at 1 MHz. Although the 4.77 MHz 8088's clock cycles are shorter, the LDA # needs 4 of them, so it takes 4 / 4.77 MHz = 0.84 μs. So that instruction runs only a little more than 2 times as fast on the original IBM PC than on the Apple II.|$|R

30|$|The {{melt flow}} {{properties}} of the KF reinforced FLO/MH bicomposites have been studied for varying temperatures and <b>weight</b> <b>loads.</b> In general, the melt flow capability has been increased for higher temperatures and <b>weight</b> <b>loads.</b> This is because the macromolecular chain has absorbed more heat at higher temperature, causing a weaker bonding. On the other hand, the shear thinning effect has been found for higher weight loadings, resulting in higher melt flow properties. FLO has the lowest melt flow indices; {{it is believed that}} the hydroxyl groups from the KF and the MH induced hydrolytic degradation on the PLA in FLO. A high content of MH induced new network junctions with better interaction forces and friction forces, causing lower MFR and MVR values. On the other hand, the smooth surface of KF has been forced to align in the flow direction when a load is applied, resulting in higher melt flow properties. Besides this, {{a large portion of the}} flow velocity was contributed by the wall slip theory, especially for low <b>weight</b> <b>loading.</b> However, complicated melt flow behaviour for KF reinforced FLO/MH biocomposites has been found in this study. A high probability of KF–KF/KF–MH collisions is expected and there are more collisions with higher fibre loading. On the other hand, increasing the MH loading in the MH biocomposites has constantly decreased the MFR and MVR values, showing that the stronger bonding in the biocomposites has resisted the macromolecular chain flow.|$|R
