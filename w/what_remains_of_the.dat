5|$|The fly Ormia ochracea {{has very}} acute hearing and targets calling male crickets. It locates its prey by ear and then lays its eggs nearby. The {{developing}} larvae burrow inside any crickets {{with which they}} come in contact {{and in the course}} of a week or so, devour <b>what</b> <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> host before pupating. In Florida, the parasitic flies were only present in the autumn, and at that time of year, the males sang less but for longer periods. A trade-off exists for the male between attracting females and being parasitized.|$|E
5|$|Cheddar Wood and {{the smaller}} Macall's Wood form a {{biological}} Site of Special Scientific Interest from <b>what</b> <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wood of the Bishops of Bath and Wells in the 13thcentury and of King Edmund the Magnificent's wood in the 10th. During the 19thcentury, its lower fringes were grubbed out to make strawberry fields. Most of these {{have been allowed to}} revert to woodland. The wood was coppiced until 1917. This site compromises a wide range of habitats which include ancient and secondary semi-natural broadleaved woodland, unimproved neutral grassland, and a complex mosaic of calcareous grassland and acidic dry dwarf-shrub heath. Cheddar Wood is one of only a few English stations for starved wood-sedge (Carex depauperata). Purple gromwell (Lithospermum purpurocaeruleum), a nationally rare plant, also grows in the wood. Butterflies include silver-washed fritillary (Argynnis paphia), dark green fritillary (Argynnis aglaja), pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne), holly blue (Celastrina argiolus) and brown argus (Aricia agestis). The slug Arion fasciatus, which has a restricted distribution in the south of England, and the soldier beetle Cantharis fusca also occur.|$|E

5|$|From 1284 to 1330, when {{accounts}} end, between £20,000 and £25,000 {{was spent}} on Caernarfon's castle and town walls. Such a sum was enormous and dwarfed the spending on castles such as Dover and Château Gaillard, which were amongst the most expensive and impressive fortifications of the later 12th and early 13thcenturies. Subsequent additions to Caernarfon were not major, and <b>what</b> <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> castle is substantially from the Edwardian period. Despite the expense, much of what was planned for the castle was never carried out. The rears of the King's Gate (the entrance from the town) and the Queen's Gate (the entrance from the south-east) were left unfinished, and foundations in the castle's interior mark where buildings would have stood had work continued.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} StarCraft is {{presented}} through its instruction manual, the briefings to each mission and conversations within the missions themselves, {{along with the}} use of cinematic cutscenes at key points. The game itself is split into three episodes, one for the player to command each race. In the first segment of the game, the player and Jim Raynor are attempting to control the colony of Mar Sara {{in the wake of the}} Zerg attacks on other Terran worlds. After the Confederacy arrests Raynor for destroying Confederate property, despite the fact that it had been infested by the Zerg, the player joins Arcturus Mengsk and the Sons of Korhal. Raynor, who is freed by Mengsk's troops, also joins and frequently accompanies the player on missions. Mengsk then begins to use Confederate technology captured on Mar Sara to lure the Zerg to Confederate installations and further his own goals. After forcing Confederate general Edmund Duke to join him, Mengsk sacrifices his own second-in-command, Sarah Kerrigan, to ensure the destruction of the Confederacy by luring the Zerg to the Confederate capital Tarsonis. Raynor is outraged by Mengsk's true aims of obtaining power at any cost and deserts, taking with him a small army of the former colonial militia of Mar Sara. Mengsk reorganizes <b>what</b> <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Terran population into the Terran Dominion, crowning himself as emperor.|$|E
5|$|While {{making a}} {{delivery}} in the Historic District, Cole is instructed {{to open the}} package. In doing so, he activates a device known as the Ray Sphere, leveling several city blocks and nearly killing him. Rescued by Zeke and Trish, he teaches himself to control his emerging powers. After using them in public to fight off a Reaper attack, the locals turn against Cole after {{he is accused of}} triggering the explosion, forcing him into hiding. He and Zeke engineer an assault on the sealed bridge, only to be ambushed by government forces. Separated from his friend, Cole meets Moya, who persuades him to return and find John. With her help, Cole restores the district's power supply, earning the attention of Sasha, who lures him into her underground lair. Cole defeats her, but she is abducted by the Sons before he can make her talk. Trapped in the Warren, Cole assists <b>what</b> <b>remains</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> police in battling the Dust Men. Alden is arrested and imprisoned, but Zeke's incompetence in guarding him allows the Dust Men to free him and massacre most of the officers. With Alden planning to reactivate the Sphere, the two patch things up and confront him, with Zeke ending up in possession of the Sphere. Giving in to his temptations, Zeke deserts Cole and takes the Sphere to Kessler.|$|E
