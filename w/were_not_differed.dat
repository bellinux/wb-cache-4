Field experiment was conducted during 2005 - 06 to evaluate the affect of plant spacing, Nitrogen fertilizer and mepiquat chloride application on cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) var. MNH 789. Three plants spacing (15, 23 and 30 cm), four nitrogen fertilizer level (0, 50, 100 and 150 kg ha - 1) with two rates of Mepiquat chloride (2 x 100, 2 x 200 mL ha - 1) were evaluated for seed cotton yield and yield components. Results showed that Plant Height (PH), Monopodial branches per plant (MB), Node of first fruiting branch (NFB), sympodial branches/plant (SB), No. of bolls/plant and seed cotton yield were different among plant spacing, nitrogen fertilizer while MB, NFB, SB and total main stem nodes/plant <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>differed</b> significantly among the Pix application.

40|$|A {{sublethal}} high {{hydrostatic pressure}} (HHP) shock {{was reported to}} significantly improve the motility and viability parameters of frozen bull and boar spermatozoa, supposedly due to the sublethal stress-induced transcriptional/post-transcriptional induction of stress proteins. However, the mechanism of cryoprotection effect of HHP treatment on sperm motility remains unclear. We have previously found that the decrease of HSP 90 might {{be associated with a}} decline in sperm motility during cooling of boar spermatozoa. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of HHP on the levels of HSP 90 and HSP 70 of boar spermatozoa before and after freezing. Semen were treated or not treated with 300 or 400 bar before the start of frozen semen preparation. Samples were collected at room temperature, 15 ℃, 5 ℃ and after thawing for protein analysis. The levels of HSP 70 and HSP 90 were analyzed by Western blotting and densitometry. The result of qualitative and quantitative protein analysis showed that the protein profile and the level of HSP 70 and HSP 90 in the HHP treated group <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>differed</b> with those in the control group (P> 0. 05). The level of HSP 90 was significantly decreased after the semen was cooling to 5 ℃ (P< 0. 05).

Thus HSP 70 and HSP 90 may not directly involve in the HHP induced cryoprotection of porcine spermatozoa.

Populations were sampled from the areas that have been treated with only the pyrethroid α-cypermethrin; pyrethroids plus OPs; deltamethrin with pheromone eco-traps, and no insecticide treatment applied areas for many years. For Ile 214 Val and Gly 488 Ser point mutations PCR-RFLP and for Δ 3 Q deletion mutation PCR diagnostic tests were carried out. Seventy-two {{percent of the total}} individuals analyzed in the study were exhibited heterozygous genotype (RS) for both Ile 214 Val and Gly 488 Ser point and homozygous susceptible genotype (SS) for Δ 3 Q deletion mutations. This RS/RS/SS combination together with RS/RR/SS with the frequency of 13 % were the most common two combinations observed in all of the populations under different insecticide regimes, even in the populations under no insecticide pressure for many years. Independent evaluation of the three mutations resulted in 0. 450, 0. 534 and 0. 037 frequency values for the resistant alleles of 214 Val, 488 Ser and Δ 3 Q mutations, respectively.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the influences of three potential additives, i. e., lava meal, sandy soil top-layer and zeolite (used in animal bedding) amended solid cattle manures on (i) ammonia (NH 3), dinitrous oxide (N 2 O), carbon dioxide (CO 2) and methane (CH 4) emissions and (ii) maize crop or grassland apparent N recovery (ANR). Diffusion samplers were installed at 20 cm height on grassland surface to measure the concentrations of NH 3 from the manures. A photoacoustic gas monitor was used to quantitate the fluxes of N 2 O, CH 4 and CO 2 after manures’ incorporation into the maize-field. Herbage ANR was calculated from dry matter yield and N uptake of three successive harvests, while maize crop ANR was determined at cusp of juvenile stage, outset of grain filling as well as physiological maturity stages. Use of additives decreased the NH 3 emission rates by about two-third from the manures applied on grassland surface than control untreated-manure. Total herbage ANR was {{more than doubled in}} treated manures and was 25 % from manure amended with farm soil, 26 % and 28 % from zeolite and lava meal, respectively compared to 11 % from control manure. In maize experiment, mean N 2 O and CO 2 emission rates were the highest from the latter treatment but these rates <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>differed</b> from zero control in case of manures amended with farm soil or zeolite. However, mean CH 4 emissions was not differed among all treatments during the whole measuring period. The highest maize crop ANR was obtained at the beginning of grain filling stage (11 – 40 %), however ample lower crop recoveries (8 – 14 %) were achieved at the final physiological maturity stage. This phenomenon was occurred due to leaf senescence N losses from maize crop during the period of grains filling. The lowest losses were observed from control manure at this stage. Hence, all additives decreased the N losses from animal manure and enhanced crop N uptake thus improved the agro-environmental worth of animal manure...|$|E

A total of 120 growing pigs ([Yorkshire×Landrace] ×Duroc) with an initial body weight (BW) 29. 94 ± 0. 06 kg were used in this experiment. Pigs were randomly allotted into 1 of 5 treatments in a randomized complete block design and 6 replicates with 4 pigs per pen. Treatments were divided by dietary RSM supplementation levels (0 %, 3 %, 6 %, 9 %, or 12 %) in growing-finishing diets. A linear decrease (p< 0. 05) of BW and average daily gain (ADG) were observed at 13 th wk of finishing and overall periods of pigs. Additionally, gain-to-feed ratio (G/F) tended to decrease by dietary RSM supplementation in growing-finishing diets (linear, p = 0. 07 and quadratic, p = 0. 08). Concentrations of serum triiodothyronine and thyroxine were not influenced by dietary RSM treatments whereas thyroid gland and liver weight were increased at 13 th wk of finishing period (linear, p< 0. 05; p< 0. 01) by increasing dietary RSM supplementation level. In blood profiles, serum total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>differed</b> by dietary treatments at 13 th wk of finishing period whereas concentration of serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol was affected by the supplementation level of RSM, resulting in a linear RSM level responses (p< 0. 05).

Crude protein, crude fat and nitrogen retention, whereas, were not affected by dietary RSM supplementation level. In the economic analysis, feed cost per weight gain was numerically decreased when RSM was provided up to 9 %. Consequently, RSM could be supplemented to growing-finishing diets up to 9 % (3. 07 μmol/g Gls) without detrimental effects on growth performance of growing-finishing pigs...|$|E
