5|$|New York Senator William M. Evarts, {{a former}} Secretary of State, {{had been a}} classmate of Alphonso Taft at Yale. Evarts called to see his friend's son as soon as Taft took office, and William and Nellie Taft were {{launched}} into Washington society. Nellie Taft was ambitious {{for herself and her}} husband, and was annoyed <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> he socialized with most were mainly Supreme Court justices, rather than the arbiters of Washington society such as Theodore Roosevelt, John Hay, Henry Cabot Lodge and their wives.|$|E
5|$|The Tahitian Dog, {{known as}} the ʻŪrī Mā’ohi in the Tahitian language, was {{introduced}} to Tahiti and the Society Islands (in modern French Polynesia) by the ancestors of the Tahitian (Mā’ohi) people during their migrations to Polynesia. They were {{closely related to the}} Hawaiian Poi Dog and the New Zealand kurī; the latter is believed to be a descendant of the breed. Similar breeds of Polynesian dogs were brought alongside pigs and chickens <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> settled the islands of Polynesia. The Marquesan Dog became extinct in the neighboring Marquesas Islands before 1595. Even though dogs were virtually absent from Western Polynesia, they were recognized when European explorers later brought them as items of trade, indicating a universal cultural recognition of the dog in the many islands.|$|E
5|$|Some time later, Pillai is released. He brings {{news that}} Jackson has been {{transferred}} back to England on Davison's recommendation. At Kattabomman's court, a British messenger sent by Colonel Ooshington, Tirunelveli's new collector, reports that Pillai {{and his men}} have looted their granaries and killed their men at Srivaikuntam. Pillai justifies his act, saying that he instructed his men {{to do it because}} of the famine conditions prevalent in their kingdom. Ashamed of Pillai's act, Kattabomman accuses him of injustice. Pillai apologises and offers himself as a prisoner to the British, but Kattabomman refuses to hand him over; instead he offers money to the British as compensation for the looted rice. Ooshington does not agree and, with Major Bannerman's and Ettappan's help, incites the neighbouring rulers to attack Kattabomman. Bannerman is placed in charge of the British troops. He and Ettappan plan to attack Panchalankurichi <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> are away attending a festival in Tiruchendur. Kattabomman's spy Sunderalingam, overhears this and informs him; he prepares for battle.|$|E

25|$|Östersund {{continued}} to grow after the Second World War. Lugnvik was incorporated into the city in 1954 and Östersund was {{just like the rest}} of Jämtland affected by the Rehn-Meidner-model, though not in the same way. The Swedish Keynesian politic was launched in order to improve the mobility of the labour force. Jämtland was struck hard by this <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> moved from the countryside to cities, from inland to coast and from the north to the south. As an urban area Östersund was affected by the Million Programme and urban districts like Körfältet were created.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the first}} things Tacitus {{mentions}} in his work Germania is that the Germanic people treasure their animals above all else. Tacitus also concludes that the Germanic people found cultivation repulsive. Instead, he states, the Germanic people devote themselves to food and sleep and besides that they prefer to remain idle. All of this, to certain extents, applied to Jämtland. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> of Jämtland settled down they relied mostly on pastoralism (transhumance). Their animals were the source of wealth and they were therefore loved by their owners. This love for the livestock has manifested itself in the dialect, a male nipple is called bokkjen (the buck) and a female nipple is known as geita (the goat).|$|E
25|$|Many of Joseph Smith's early revelations prophesied {{that the}} Latter Day Saints would build Zion, a new Jerusalem, a {{religious}} utopia centered in Jackson County, MO. The Prophet urged {{his followers to}} give everything they had to this cause. However, when they failed to live the Law of Consecration, which was a promise to voluntarily give all their property to the community for equal distribution, Joseph Smith received a revelation that God would build Zion later, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> were ready. Both the Community of Christ and the LDS Church {{have come to understand}} Zion as primarily a community way of life that is centered around Jesus Christ, but many people still believe that, when they are ready, {{they will be able to}} build the literal city of Zion as well.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, {{the image}} was taken to Piat, and {{enshrined}} on a side altar. It was not long <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> felt special manifestations of divine favors through Our Lady. Their love and devotion to Our Lady had grown with the years, and attachment to her image bordered fantacism. This was clearly seen when Fr. Juan De Santa Ana sent the same image to Tuguegarao City in 1622 and ordered another one more beautiful from Manila to replace the image. The people promptly protested this, insisting that the original image be returned to them. Fr. de Santa Ana finally gave in, and {{the image was}} brought back amidst great rejoicing. There arose, however, a dispute between the peoples of Piat and Tuao as to where the image's sanctuary should be; both towns agreed to build the shrine midway between them.|$|E
