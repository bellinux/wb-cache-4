5|$|I <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> nice girl. It's {{really hard}} to play. All the other {{characters}} came from somebody and I said to Mike , 'Where do I come from?' And he said, 'You were the fantasy girl.' I {{found it hard to}} make anything of that. In the end I felt the only thing I could do was to make it as hyper real as I could. I'm not a natural comedienne.|$|E

5|$|With {{the piece}} {{set to open}} on 26 December, Gilbert first read the {{libretto}} to the cast on 14 December, but Toole, who <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> central role of Thespis, did not return from {{a tour of the}} British provinces until 18 December. He then appeared in nine performances at the Gaiety in the six days immediately after his return, and other actors had similar commitments. In addition, Hollingshead had committed the company to perform a pantomime at The Crystal Palace on 21 December, which included many of the performers who would be in Thespis. Lastly, Thespis was to play as the afterpiece to an H. J. Byron comedy, Dearer than Life, which shared many of its actors, including Toole and Fred Sullivan, and had to be rehearsed at the same time.|$|E

25|$|Barbara Kelly {{was born}} in Vancouver, British Columbia in 1924. As a child, she was given elocution lessons, and while Kelly hated the stage {{her mother was a}} {{frustrated}} actress.

Her mother, who was from Manchester, forced ballet classes and elocution lessons on her.|$|E
25|$|Trapped in Friuli, Gregory XII had to {{be rescued}} by ships which had been sent by Ladislaus of Naples.

25|$|The {{beauty and}} variety of tone, the {{impeccable}} mechanism, and the noble, architectonic conception were great pianism and great musicianship.

25|$|Toowong FC: A Toowong club is {{reported}} {{as early as}} 1911, however it is uncertain which football code it <b>was</b> <b>playing.</b> <b>The</b> first results recorded for a Toowong ‘soccer’ club were in 1913, whilst reports also refer to a Toowong Caledonians 'soccer' club and a 'new' Toowong senior club forming in the early 1920s. However, Toowong clubs appear to have disbanded then re-formed a few times over the decades. The modern Toowong club plays at Dunmore Park, Auchenflower.|$|E
25|$|The Cavaliers were a {{young team}} in 2006, leading Groh to joke that the 2007 team <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> 2006 season. While Groh had {{frequently}} played true freshman in earlier seasons, sometime for very limited action, he redshirted the entire freshman class in 2006 except for defensive lineman Nate Collins. Several players from that class {{are expected to}} be contributors in 2007, in particular running back Keith Payne has generated excitement among fans. Several talented true freshmen, such as quarterback Peter Lalich, joined the team in 2007.|$|E
25|$|The SCG {{has been}} both a happy and unhappy hunting ground for Australian rugby union. One of the worst {{incidents}} to occur there was the sad demise of Ken Catchpole's international career. Robbed of a glorious retirement, his career ended in a disgraceful scandal. Australia <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> New Zealand All Blacks and while Catchpole was trapped {{on the bottom of}} a ruck New Zealander second rower, Colin Meads, tried to drag him out by one leg, splitting him like a wishbone. Australia, although well beaten on this occasion, was well served by international-standard halfbacks and 20-year-old John Hipwell ran on for his first test as Catchpole was carried off. It was a sad end to an illustrious career.|$|E

If three sets <b>are</b> <b>played,</b> <b>the</b> pieces usually go into the opponent's starting corners.|$|R
25|$|Under {{the name}} Deep Space Soundworks, Atkins and May began to DJ on Detroit’s party circuit. By 1981, Mojo <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> record mixes {{recorded}} by the Belleville Three, who were also branching out {{to work with other}} musicians. The trio traveled to Chicago to investigate the house music scene there, particularly the legendary Chicago DJs Ron Hardy and Frankie Knuckles. House was a natural progression from disco music, so that the trio began to formulate the synthesis of this dance music with the mechanical sounds of groups like Kraftwerk, in a way that reflected post-industrialist Detroit. An obsession with the future and its machines is reflected in much of their music, because, according to Atkins, Detroit is the most advanced in the transition away from industrialism.|$|E
25|$|Henry, illegitimate son of Alfonso XI of Castile and {{half-brother}} of Peter, {{took advantage}} of the dissatisfaction among the noblemen to launch a war against Peter, with the support of Peter IV of Aragon, with whom Peter was already at war, and along companies of mercenaries such as that commanded by Bertrand du Guesclin. Meanwhile, Peter drew his support from the municipalities and part of the nobility, most notably the Galician Castro family headed by Fernando Rodrigues de Castro, Pertegueiro Maior of Santiago and Adelantado Mayor of Galicia, who after defecting Henry in 1355 <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> same role as the Traba family two hundred years before. Other notable supporters were Sueiro Eans Parada, Men Rodrigues de Seabra, and the Moscoso family.|$|E
25|$|His {{most notable}} role <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> Trinidadian charmer, Jules Tavernier, in BBC's EastEnders from 1990 to 1997. The {{introduction}} of the Tavernier family heralded {{the first time that}} an entire family had joined the programme all at once. Their introduction was also a well-intentioned attempt to portray a wider range of black characters than had previously been achieved on the show. Eytle played the role for seven years, remaining after the departures of all of his on-screen family. Towards the end of his time on the show his character became semi-regular, and his appearances became increasingly sparse due to Eytle's poor-health. He was never given an official exit from the series, but was not featured again after December 1997.|$|E

25|$|From September to December 2008, she {{appeared}} as Mrs Johnstone in the long-running UK tour of Willy Russell's musical Blood Brothers, succeeding Linda Nolan who left due to illness. The {{producer of the}} show, Bill Kenwright {{had been trying to}} persuade Webb to play the role for around 20 years and she was only free by chance. As Nolan was ill, she had just {{a week and a half}} to rehearse, around half the time normally expected for the rehearsal of such a tour. Birmingham-born Niki Evans <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> role in the West End at the time, so while the tour visited Birmingham, Webb briefly took over in the London production to allow Evans to play her home city.|$|E
25|$|The tonic key of {{the song}} is F major (although, since McCartney tuned his guitar down a whole step, he <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> chords {{as if it were}} in G), where the song begins before veering off into the key of D minor. It is this {{frequent}} use of the minor, and the ii-V7 chord progression (Em and A7 chords in this case) leading into it, that gives the song its melancholy aura. The A7 chord {{is an example of a}} secondary dominant, specifically a V/vi chord. The G7 chord in the bridge is another secondary dominant, in this case a V/V chord, but rather than resolve it to the expected chord, as with the A7 to Dm in the verse, McCartney instead follows it with the IV chord, a B. This motion creates a descending chromatic line of C–B–B–A to accompany the title lyric.|$|E
25|$|While in {{the process}} of {{adopting}} the itinerant lifestyle of a musician, Irvine developed a taste for travel, initially within Ireland. The first time he witnessed Willie Clancy playing his uilleann pipes was at a fleadh in Miltown Malbay in the summer of 1963, and he followed the festival trail in Ireland during the summers of 1964, 1965 and 1966. Irvine also returned regularly to London for short stays of a few weeks or months, and ventured further afield across Europe, hitch-hiking to Munich, Vienna and Rome in the autumn of 1965. In early 1966, he <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> clubs in Denmark with Éamonn O'Doherty. In June 1966, Irvine and Dolan played five nights a week as a duo at the Enda Hotel in Galway and Moynihan would join them at weekends, since he was still working as a draughtsman in Roscommon. It was at this time that Dolan suggested the band's name, after reading Flann O'Brien's comic novel At Swim-Two-Birds, which depicts the mad, anti-religious, tree-leaping pagan King Sweeney of Antrim.|$|E
