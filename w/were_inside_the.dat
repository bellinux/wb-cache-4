Several of the Times podcasts were cancelled in 2012. The Times returned to launching new podcasts in 2016, including Modern Love with WBUR. On January 30, 2017, The New York Times {{launched a new}} podcast The Daily.|$|E
5|$|Cornerback Fernando Bryant led the team's pass defense. He {{finished}} {{the season with}} 51 tackles and two interceptions. He was supported by strong safety Marcus Spencer, who led the Crimson Tide in interceptions with four. Alabama's sole All-Southeastern Conference selection was punter Daniel Pope, a senior who averaged a school-record 44 yards per kick {{during the regular season}} and was second nationally in net punting at 40.8 yards per kick. Of his 60 punts, 20 <b>were</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> opponents' 20-yard line. None were blocked.|$|E

5|$|Henry II visited York Castle {{four times}} during his reign. The royal {{chambers}} {{at the time}} <b>were</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> keep for safety, and Henry paid £15 for repairs to the keep. During his 1175 visit, Henry used the castle as the base for receiving the homage of William the Lion of Scotland. Castle mills were built close by to support the garrison, and the military order of the Knights Templar was granted ownership of the mills in the mid-12th century. The mills proved to be vulnerable to the flooding of the two rivers {{and had to be}} repeatedly repaired.|$|E
5|$|Music with a fast {{rhythm of}} 120 bpm {{was used in}} an attempt to keep the teams walking quickly around the stadium, and this was {{reinforced}} by the drummers in the stadium; nevertheless the parade part of the programme took 1 hour 40 minutes to complete, compared to the 1 hour 29 minutes estimated in the official media guide. Once all of the athletes <b>were</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> stadium, 7 billion small pieces of paper were dropped from a Westland helicopter, each piece representing one person on Earth.|$|E
5|$|According to {{production}} staff, scenes involving the alien queen {{were the most}} difficult to film. A life-sized mock-up was created by Stan Winston's company in the United States to see how it would operate. Once the testing was complete, the crew working on the queen flew to England and began work creating the final version. Standing at 14 feet (4.3 m) tall, it was operated using a mixture of puppeteers, control rods, hydraulics, cables, and a crane above to support it. Two puppeteers <b>were</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> suit operating its arms, and 16 were required to move it. All sequences involving the full size queen were filmed in-camera with no post-production manipulation. Additionally, a miniature alien queen was used for certain shots.|$|E

5|$|An {{estimated}} 646people <b>were</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> building {{when the}} bomb exploded. By {{the end of}} the day, 14 adults and 6 children were confirmed dead, and over 100 injured. The toll eventually reached 168confirmed dead, not including an unmatched left leg that could have belonged to an unidentified 169th victim or could have belonged to any one of eight victims who had been buried without a left leg. Most of the deaths resulted from the collapse of the building, rather than the bomb blast itself. Those killed included 163 who were in the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, one person in the Athenian Building, one woman in a parking lot across the street, a man and woman in the Oklahoma Water Resources building, and a rescue worker struck on the head by debris.|$|E
5|$|At 8:00pm the Japanese {{sent two}} Type 95 tanks with bright {{headlights}} into the plantation. The {{men from the}} 2/10th tried to disable them with sticky bombs, but due to the humid conditions the bombs failed {{to adhere to the}} Japanese armour. In the fighting that followed over the course of two and a half hours, the Australians suffered heavy casualties. Receiving indirect fire support from the 2/5th Field Regiment's 25 pounder guns situated near Gili Gili, they repelled four frontal attacks. However, by midnight the Japanese <b>were</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> Australian position and in the confusion the 2/10th withdrew in some disorder to a number of scattered positions on {{the west bank of the}} Gama, which they reached by about 2:00am on 28 August. A further assault, however, by tank-mounted infantry forced them back further, moving back through the 61st and 25th Infantry Battalions towards No. 3 Airstrip, which was still under construction, south of Kilarbo. During the brief engagement around KB Mission, they had lost 43 men killed and another 26 wounded.|$|E
5|$|During the night, Pyrrhus {{was able}} to enter Argos. While Pausanias recounts that he did so by force, Plutarch asserts that Diamperes Gate had been left open for the Epiriotes by Aristeas. Hammond opines {{that it is more}} likely that Aristeas {{admitted}} Pyrrhus into the city. Although Pyrrhus' Gauls were able to occupy the Argive agora, the rest of the army was delayed due to the war elephants being too large to pass through the gate. In order for them to enter, the towers need to be taken off their backs and reattached once they <b>were</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> city. Furthermore, Pyrrhus left the majority of his army outside the city walls under the command of his son Helenus. This delay gave the Argives enough time to reach their citadel, the Aspis, and seek aid from Antigonus. The Macedonian king responded immediately, advancing towards the city walls and sending a relief force inside under the command of his son Halcyoneus.|$|E

5|$|Major Kean {{returned}} to {{the ground floor of}} the Chancery and ordered his men to withdraw into a large semicircle at the main entrance to the Chancery. Most of the Marines <b>were</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> Chancery when the crowds outside the Embassy broke through the gates into the compound. The Marines closed and bolted the Chancery door, the elevators were locked by Seabees on the sixth floor and the Marines withdrew up the stairwells locking grill gates behind them. On the ground floor a water tanker was driven through the Chancery door and the crowd began to surge up through the building toward the rooftop. The Marines on the rooftop had sealed the doors and were using Mace to discourage the crowd from trying to break through. Sporadic gunfire from around the Embassy passed over the rooftop.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of the shooting, {{approximately}} 150 people <b>were</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> cafeteria. A vice-principal ordered the school to go into lockdown. The victims were all identified as friends of Fryberg. It was initially reported that at least six students were wounded.|$|E

At the height of the blaze, a hundred or more firefighters <b>were</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> building.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} four Spanish Popes. Damasus I, Calixtus III, Alexander VI and Benedict XIII. Spanish mysticism was an {{important}} intellectual fight against Protestantism with Teresa of Ávila, a reformist nun, ahead. The Society of Jesus was founded by Ignatius of Loyola and Francisco Javier. In the 1960s, Jesuits Pedro Arrupe and Ignacio Ellacuría <b>were</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> movement of Liberation Theology.|$|E
25|$|Howard Carter {{writes in}} his {{description}} of Tutankhamun's tomb that the Pharaoh's earlobes were perforated, but no earrings <b>were</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> wrappings, although the tomb contained some. The burial mask's ears were perforated as well, but the holes were covered with golden discs. That implies that at the time, earrings were only worn in Egypt by children, much like in Egypt of Carter's times.|$|E

Martin's own dog had also been recently run over by a car, and K9 was a car-proof tribute to it.|$|E
25|$|Marino {{finished}} {{the game with}} 167 passing yards and three touchdowns. Running back Bobby Humphrey rushed for 71 yards and caught three passes for 30. Miami also got a big performance out of punter Reggie Roby, who planted four of his eight punts inside the Chargers 20-yard line, including three that <b>were</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> 7. Lewis gained 130 all-purpose yards, including four kickoff returns for 111. San Diego rookie linebacker Junior Seau had 18 tackles.|$|E
25|$|The IDF {{originally}} {{claimed that}} Hamas militants <b>were</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> school, firing rockets and mortars.

The IDF stated that among the Hamas gunmen inside the school were Imad and Hassan Abu-Askar, known to the IDF as Hamas rocket-launching operatives, and claimed to have found their bodies following the attack. The Israeli military declared that it responded with a single shell at the school, resulting in an explosion because Hamas had booby-trapped the school.|$|E
