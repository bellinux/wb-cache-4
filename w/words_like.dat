5|$|In {{the era of}} the {{influential}} linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, it was assumed that the mapping between form and meaning in language must be completely arbitrary. Although onomatopoeia is a clear exception, since <b>words</b> <b>like</b> 'choo-choo' bear clear resemblance to the sounds that they mimic, the Saussurean approach was to treat these as marginal exceptions. ASL, with its significant inventory of iconic signs, directly challenges this theory.|$|E
5|$|Armenian {{geographic}} {{names were}} first changed under {{the reign of}} Sultan Abdulhamit II. In 1880, the word Armenia was banned from use in the press, schoolbooks, and governmental establishments, to be replaced with <b>words</b> <b>like</b> Anatolia or Kurdistan. Armenian name changing continued under the early Republican era up until the 21st century. It included the Turkification of last names, change of animal names, change {{of the names of}} Armenian historical figures (i.e. the name of the prominent Balyan family was concealed under the identity of a superficial Italian family called Baliani), and the change and distortion of Armenian historical events.|$|E

5|$|Changes {{may affect}} {{specific}} sounds or the entire phonological system. Sound change can consist of {{the replacement of}} one speech sound or phonetic feature by another, {{the complete loss of}} the affected sound, or even the introduction of a new sound in a place where there had been none. Sound changes can be conditioned in which case a sound is changed only if it occurs in the vicinity of certain other sounds. Sound change is usually assumed to be regular, which means that it is expected to apply mechanically whenever its structural conditions are met, irrespective of any non-phonological factors. On the other hand, sound changes can sometimes be sporadic, affecting only one particular word or a few words, without any seeming regularity. Sometimes a simple change triggers a chain shift in which the entire phonological system is affected. This happened in the Germanic languages when the sound change known as Grimm's law affected all the stop consonants in the system. The original consonant * became /b/ in the Germanic languages, the previous * in turn became /p/, and the previous * became /f/. The same process applied to all stop consonants and explains why Italic languages such as Latin have p in <b>words</b> <b>like</b> pater and pisces, whereas Germanic languages, like English, have father and fish.|$|E

25|$|In {{many cases}} in Papiamentu, the acute accent {{preserves}} emphasis in words of Spanish and/or Portuguese origin {{where they would}} otherwise have naturally occurred, i.e. without an acute accent. In these cases, words have undergone a seemingly systematic elision of final letters, or apocope. In verbs, the final -r in infinitive form and -do of past participles had been dropped, among other examples. <b>Words</b> <b>like</b> reconocer (to recognise) became rekonosé and marcado (marked) became marká. As for the ending of words describing a person of a certain profession or craft, <b>words</b> <b>like</b> zapatero (cobbler) and pescador (fisherman) became sapaté and piskadó. This phonological change brought with it the orthographical problem in distinguishing between certain <b>words</b> <b>like</b> kushina, from cocina (kitchen) and kushiná, from cocinar (to cook). This is resolved {{by the use of}} the acute accent.|$|E

25|$|One likely {{reason for}} the {{relatively}} few Japanese words for 'fool' is vagueness. In both English and Japanese, the words for 'fool' have meanings that vary along scales of friendly-hostile, or joking-serious. In English, {{at one end of}} a scale are <b>words</b> <b>like</b> silly goose and at the other end are <b>words</b> <b>like</b> stupid asshole. And in Japanese, at one end are <b>words</b> <b>like</b> kamaboko baka 蒲鉾馬鹿 'silly chump' and at the other end are <b>words</b> <b>like</b> baka-yarō 馬鹿野郎 'damn fool'. The difference is in the degree of lexical diversification along the scales of meaning. English seems to have more 'fool' words with more specificity – Japanese seems to have fewer 'fool' words with more vagueness. There are decided pragmatic and communicative advantages to such lexical vagueness. If you call me a stupid son-of-a-bitch, I know exactly what you mean. But if you call me a baka-yarō, I cannot be so sure of what you mean. The expression baka-yarō 馬鹿野郎 {{is one of the most}} insulting terms in the Japanese lexicon, but it is vague and can range in meaning from an affectionate 'silly-willy' to an abusive 'jerk-off fool'. Baka-yarō is so widely used that it has become semantically weak and vague. Such vagueness can serve to conceal hostility and thus to maintain social harmony.|$|E

25|$|Iambic {{shortening}} or brevis brevians is vowel shortening {{that occurs}} in words of the type light–heavy, where the light syllable is stressed.

5000|$|Some {{differences}} in pronunciation {{may relate to}} socioeconomic background and level of education. For example, a <b>word</b> <b>like</b> [...] "note" [...] is pronounced with a diphthong, /nəʊt/ in British English and /noʊt/ in American English. In SLE, it is pronounced /noːt/ with the monophthong, /oː/ and is accepted as normal in Sri Lanka. However, pronouncing a <b>word</b> <b>like</b> [...] "hall" [...] ( [...] /hɔːl/ [...] ) as /‍hoːl/ is not accepted. Other words pronounced with a monophthong include: take and made.|$|R

25|$|Thus {{it helps}} to {{distinguish}} <b>words</b> <b>like</b> Buße (long vowel) 'penance, fine' and Busse (short vowel) 'buses'.

25|$|Older Bristolians {{and those}} that live in areas which have had less {{influence}} from students and immigration, such as Southmead and Hartcliffe, speak a distinctive dialect of English (known colloquially as Brizzle or Bristle).

6000|$|Of course, {{the main}} fact about {{education}} {{is that there}} is no such thing. It does not exist, as theology or soldiering exist. Theology is a <b>word</b> <b>like</b> geology, soldiering is a <b>word</b> <b>like</b> soldering; these sciences may be healthy or no as hobbies; but they deal with stone and kettles, with definite things. But education is not a <b>word</b> <b>like</b> geology or kettles. Education is a <b>word</b> <b>like</b> [...] "transmission" [...] or [...] "inheritance"; it is not an object, but a method. It must mean the conveying of certain facts, views or qualities, to the last baby born. They might be the most trivial facts or the most preposterous views or the most offensive qualities; but if they are handed on from one generation to another they are education. Education is not a thing like theology, it is not an inferior or superior thing; it is not a thing in the same category of terms. Theology and education are to each other like a love-letter to the General Post Office. Mr. Fagin was quite as educational as Dr. Strong; in practice probably more educational. It is giving something--perhaps poison. Education is tradition, and tradition (as its name implies) can be treason.|$|R
25|$|Deaths were {{recognized}} to evil spirits or to kanaima, who were healers that had evil intentions and solely used their powers for that reason.

25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that <b>words</b> <b>like</b> {{unpleasant}} and grating are often used to explain the sound of dissonance, all music with a harmonic or tonal basiseven music perceived as generally harmoniousincorporates some degree of dissonance. The buildup and release of tension (dissonance and resolution), which can occur on every level from the subtle to the crass, is partially responsible for what listeners perceive as beauty, emotion, and expressiveness in music.|$|E
25|$|Many Tunisian and Maghrebi <b>words,</b> <b>like</b> qarnīṭ, have a Latin etymology.

Also, Siculo-Arabic was spoken in several islands near Tunisia like Sicily, Pantelleria, and Malta and entered {{into contact with}} the Tunisian pre-hilalian dialects. Consequently, it ameliorated the divergence in grammar and structures of all the concerned dialects from Classical Arabic.|$|E
