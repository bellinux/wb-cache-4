40|$|Abstract – To {{survive in}} the global marketplace, {{companies}} has adopted lean towards reducing wastes and improving their efficiency. Manpower study traditionally employs work study methods such as Process Mapping and Man-Machine Charts which are no longer suitable {{to be used in}} the complicated manufacturing environment such as in the electronics manufacturing facility. Thus, a modified work-study architecture is designed and applied at the process under study to optimize the man-machine configuration. This paper details out the development and implementation of the work study architecture to perform lean <b>waste</b> <b>analysis</b> at an electronic manufacturing company. The benefits observed from the implementation phase indicate that the lean <b>waste</b> <b>analysis</b> performed using this system has reduced the lengthy time that work-study usually takes, eliminated human error during analysis and improved the accuracy of data...|$|R

40|$|The present paper {{provides}} a simple multiregional input-output model for <b>waste</b> <b>analysis</b> {{with which to}} estimate intraregional and interregional effects of industrial wastes embodied in regional final consumptions. The empirical analyses using 1995 nine-regions input-output tables reveals the regional properties of the interregional linkage effects. The Kanto and Kinki regions remarkably control the industrial waste emissions and waste landfills within their own regions by importing waste-intensive intermediate goods and services from the other regions. The Chugoku and Shikoku regions greatly contributed {{to the production of}} the waste-intensive goods and services for the other regions, considering the waste emissions and waste landfills relative to the commodity production levels. We also find that the household consumption behaviour in other regions indirectly plays a more important role in waste emissions than the municipal waste disposal behaviour in the region in question at least in 1995.
