Mark convinces {{the rest of the group}} to cover up the death. He instructs Susan, who was the last one known to the police to see Mr. Griffin, to tell them Mr. Griffin kept looking at his watch during the conference and left <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> woman. Jeff, Mark, and David bury the body in the mountains. Betsy and David also drive Mr. Griffin's car to the airport, but the officer who gave Betsy a ticket sees her there. Worried that the officer might later identify the car as Mr. Griffin's, Jeff and Betsy move the car into Jeff's garage so he can repaint it before they hide it elsewhere.|$|E
500|$|The Emancipation of Mimi spawns {{yet another}} career-redefining {{hit in the}} sweet, soulful [...] "Fly Like a Bird", an honest-to-God {{religious}} mantra about redemption. Set against a low-key, organ-spiced groove that recalls mid-'70s R, Carey opens <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty,</b> wispy vocal and buoyant harmonies throughout the first chorus before she waves her arms, parts the clouds and wails to the heavens as a mile-high wall of gospel background vocals joins in for the crescendo. The flight of 'Bird' from humble call for deliverance into a frenzied ecclesiastic hymn is utterly spine-tingling. A joyful noise.|$|E

Penn explained in 2007 that [...] "the original idea was to have me do a young X-Men spin-off, a spin-off of the young X-Men characters. But someone came up <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> interesting idea [...] it was this guy who worked with me named Mike Chamoy, he worked a lot with me on X3.

Once Aubuchon entered the writer's room, he began {{speaking}} of the cliffhanger [...] "it became a really fun challenge." [...] Out of that cliffhanger, says Aubuchon, [...] "came some really positive things that propel {{a lot of the}} storytelling in the second season. And the writers came up <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> cool way for Tom Mason to get off that spaceship again." [...] "You'll always catch people after a huge trauma saying, 'Oh, it wasn't that bad.' Or, 'It was fun,' Or, 'It was cool falling off that cliff,'" [...] says Aubuchon. [...] "The truth is, at first it was like, 'Oh my God, should i just say I can't do this job?' Ultimately, though, I think it turned out cool." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Henson worked with {{illustrator}} / designer William Stout on {{a feature film}} starring animatronic dinosaurs with the working title of The Natural History Project. In 1991, news stories written around the premiere of The Jim Henson Company-produced Dinosaurs sitcom highlighted the show's connection to Henson. [...] "Jim Henson dreamed up the show's basic concept about three years ago," [...] said a New York Times article in April 1991. 'He {{wanted it to be}} a sitcom <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> standard structure, with the biggest differences being that it's a family of dinosaurs and their society has this strange toxic life style,' said [...] Brian Henson. But until The Simpsons took off, said Alex Rockwell, {{a vice president of the}} Henson organization, 'people thought it was a crazy idea.' A New Yorker article said that Henson continued to work on a dinosaur project (presumably the Dinosaurs concept) until the [...] "last months of his life." ...|$|E
500|$|Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel {{gave the}} film {{one out of}} five stars saying, [...] "It's all bunk and has been for years. These are all no-win scenarios.

Pandering to the 'Cool, let's see that again' crowd has made Lionsgate rich but done nothing for this unendurable endurance contest of this long-enduring film franchise". [...] Mike Hale of The New York Times called the film the most [...] "straightforward" [...] of the series and the [...] "most consistently (though not inventively) violent". He ended his review saying, [...] "If you see the film in a theater equipped with RealD 3D and Dolby sound, you'll come away <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> good idea of what it would feel like to have flying body parts hit you in the face".|$|E

The screenshot shows Alan Wake in a different attire, with a flannel shirt and jeans, next to a road sign that says the town of Night Springs is 15 miles away. Night Springs is a fictional television show in Alan Wake, and is the setting of said show. On 10 November, a short teaser trailer was unveiled. During {{the days leading up}} to the publication of the first screenshot, Remedy employees made a number of comments on the official Alan Wake community forums about the new game. It was shared that the new title is [...] "structured like a full release complete <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> damn impressive storyline that expands the originals in some interesting ways." [...] Although no specifics were revealed, Remedy responded to fans who were worried that being an Xbox Live Arcade game meant that the amount of content in the game would be too small. Remedy claimed that there will definitely be enough [...] "value for money" [...] for the players of the game, and that fans [...] "will be blown away by the proportion of things pretty soon".|$|E
500|$|In 1891 Robey {{visited the}} Royal Aquarium in Westminster where he watched [...] "Professor Kennedy", a burlesque mesmerist from America. After the performance, Robey visited Kennedy in his {{dressing}} room and offered {{himself as the}} stooge for his next appearance. They agreed that Robey, as his young apprentice, would be [...] "mesmerised" [...] into singing a comic song. At a later rehearsal, Robey negotiated a deal to sing one of the comic songs that had been written for him by Rogers. Robey's turn was a great success, {{and as a result}} he secured a permanent theatrical residency at the venue. Later that year, he appeared as a solo act at the Oxford Music Hall, where he performed [...] "The Simple Pimple" [...] and [...] "He'll Get It Where He's Gone to Now". The theatrical press soon became aware of his act, and The Stage called him a [...] "comedian <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> sense of humour [...] delivers his songs with considerable point and meets with all success". In early 1892, together with his performances at the Royal Aquarium and the Oxford Music Hall, Robey starred alongside Jenny Hill, Bessie Bonehill and Harriet Vernon at the Paragon Theatre of Varieties in Mile End, where, according to his biographer Peter Cotes, he [...] "stole the notices from experienced troupers".|$|E
500|$|The 2010 TIP {{report also}} {{condemned}} Canada's {{lack of a}} national action plan, and said that Canada is a destination, source, and transit country for forced prostitution, unfree labour, the prostitution of children, {{and other forms of}} human trafficking. The report said that the federal and provincial governments of Canada were not cooperating sufficiently with respect to policing these crimes, and that a strategy for cooperation should be formulated in a national action plan. York Regional Police vice unit Detective Thai Truong agreed with the report's assessment, and said that [...] "a unified understanding and approach" [...] to human trafficking [...] "does not even exist at the municipal level of policing" [...] in Canada. Also in 2010, retired Toronto Police Service officer Dave Perry said that Canada's lack of a national action plan had resulted in the country failing to adequately deal with North Preston's Finest, a gang that engages in sex trafficking between Nova Scotia and Toronto. Perry had led a police taskforce against the gang in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but he said that without a national action plan, politicians lost interest in the endeavour and funding ran out. Perry stated that a plan would need to be well-funded because traffickers in Canada are making [...] "big, big money...and {{the only way you can}} combat that is <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> healthy budget." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Hubbard, the team's [...] "greatest asset was [...] {{the list}} of {{mistakes}} we made during Shogo. We started this project <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> sober view of what we could achieve. As a result, every major feature we outlined {{made it into the}} game, as well as a few additional items we came up with during the project." [...] However, there were still things that the team didn't have enough time to implement. For example, No One Lives Forevers team-based multiplayer portion was originally going to be a story-driven cooperative gameplay mode (similar to the [...] "Assault" [...] game type in the 1999 first-person shooter Unreal Tournament), including objectives and obstacles for the two teams. Like the single-player story in the game, this gameplay mode was also going to incorporate humor; for example, in one map, a goal of each team was to find a special watermelon for a mayor in a Moroccan marketplace. While this mode was publicly discussed even in July 2000, it is not present as such in the final product (which went gold on October 20). The different objectives were changed to a general goal for both teams in all maps: photographing the other team's intelligence item. However, a number of remnants stemming from the earlier gameplay design can be seen in some of the released maps, such as the office of the aforementioned mayor seen in the Morocco map. Fully realized co-operative multiplayer was, however, a feature of No One Lives Forever 2.|$|E
500|$|Anne exerted a {{powerful}} charm {{on those who}} met her, though opinions differed on her attractiveness. The Venetian diarist Marino Sanuto, who saw Anne when Henry VIII met Francis I at Calais in October 1532, described her as [...] "not one of the handsomest women in the world; she is of middling stature, swarthy complexion, long neck, wide mouth, bosom not much raised... eyes, which are black and beautiful". Simon Grynée wrote to Martin Bucer in September 1531 that Anne was [...] "young, good-looking, of a rather dark complexion". Lancelot de Carle called her [...] "beautiful with an elegant figure", and a Venetian in Paris in 1528 also reported that {{she was said to}} be beautiful. The most influential description of Anne, but also the least reliable, was written by the Catholic propagandist and polemicist Nicholas Sanders in 1586, half a century after Anne's death: [...] "Anne Boleyn was rather tall of stature, with black hair, and an oval face of a sallow complexion, as if troubled with jaundice. It is said she had a projecting tooth under the upper lip, and on her right hand six fingers. There was a large wen under her chin, and therefore to hide its ugliness she wore a high dress covering her throat... She was handsome to look at, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> mouth". Sanders held Anne responsible for Henry VIII's rejection of the Catholic Church, and writing fifty years after her death, was keen to demonise her. Sanders's description contributed to what biographer Eric Ives calls the [...] "monster legend" [...] of Anne Boleyn. Though his details were fictitious, they have formed the basis for references to Anne's appearance even in some modern textbooks.|$|E

The characters have literally been to hell and back, and along the way, they have woven a complicated and compelling mythology filled with friends (angel Castiel), recurring foes (demon Crowley), and inside jokes (Wincest!). Supernatural has also, however, dedicated episodes to mocking the sillier aspects of its own existence, like its hypercritical fandom. This self-referential approach has rewarded longtime viewers and helped build a community so passionate, it's almost scary." [...] The show has a broad demographic base and is more popular in Russia than the US.|$|E
2500|$|Buñuel's {{films were}} {{famous for their}} surreal imagery, [...] {{including}} scenes in which chickens populate nightmares, women grow beards, and aspiring saints are desired by lascivious women. Even in the many movies he made for hire (rather than for his own creative reasons), such as Susana and The Great Madcap, he usually added his trademark of disturbing and surreal images. [...] Some critics {{have pointed out that}} one reason why Buñuel found working in Mexico so congenial was that what might seem unusual or even outlandish in Europe or the United States fit comfortably with elements of Mexican culture and the audience's expectations of national melodrama. [...] As filmmaker Tomás Pérez Turrent has commented, when referring to the apparently incredible features that many critics find in Buñuel's films: [...] "In Mexico, it's believable", while {{one of the founders of}} Surrealism, André Breton, called Mexico, [...] "the most surrealist country in the world." [...] Certainly, running through the more personal films of Buñuel's early and late years is a backbone of surrealism; [...] Buñuel's world is one in which an entire dinner party suddenly finds itself inexplicably unable to leave the room and go home, a bad dream hands a man a letter which he brings to the doctor the next day, and where the devil, if unable to tempt a saint <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> girl, will fly him to a disco. An example of a more Dada influence can be found in Cet obscur objet du désir, when Mathieu closes his eyes and has his valet spin him around and direct him to a map on the wall.|$|E
