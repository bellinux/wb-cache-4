25|$|Overhand right : The {{overhand}} {{right is}} a punch {{not found in}} every boxer's arsenal. Unlike the right cross, which has a trajectory parallel to the ground, the overhand right has a looping circular arc as it is thrown over the shoulder <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> facing away from the boxer. It is especially popular with smaller stature boxers trying to reach taller opponents. Boxers who have used this punch consistently and effectively include former heavyweight champions Rocky Marciano and Tim Witherspoon, as well as MMA champions Chuck Liddell and Fedor Emelianenko. The overhand right has become a popular weapon in other tournaments that involve fist striking.|$|E
25|$|The Palm Beach County Fire Rescue {{partners}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palm</b> Beach County Health Care District {{to operate}} the Trauma Hawk Aero-Medical Program. The Trauma Hawk program, established in November 1990, replaced the use of Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office helicopters to medevac critically injured patients to area hospitals. At the Trauma Hawk Station, located at the south west corner of Palm Beach International Airport, the department has two Sikorsky S-76C helos. The air ambulances are identically equipped and can carry two patients each and up to four medical attendants if needed. Each helicopter is staffed with a pilot, a registered nurse (RN) and a paramedic. The nurses and paramedics are Palm Beach County Fire Rescue employees while the pilots are Health Care District employees.|$|E

25|$|To {{grip the}} ball for a leg-spinning delivery, the ball is placed into the palm with the seam {{parallel}} to the palm. The first two fingers then spread and grip the ball, and {{the third and fourth}} fingers close together and rest {{against the side of the}} ball. The first bend of the third finger should grasp the seam. The thumb resting against the side is up to the bowler, but should impart no pressure. When the ball is bowled, the third finger will apply most of the spin. The wrist is cocked as it comes down by the hip, and the wrist moves sharply from right to left as the ball is released, adding more spin. The ball is tossed up to provide flight. The batsman will see the hand <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> facing towards them when the ball is released.|$|E
25|$|Kyuss {{broke up}} in 1995 {{after the release}} of their final album, with many members going on to develop the stoner and desert rock scene through new projects. In August 1997, Kyuss' Josh Homme founded The Desert Sessions at the now-famous Rancho De La Luna in Joshua Tree, California. This musical {{collective}} brings artists together for impromptu writing and recording sessions that yielded ten albums between 1997 and 2003. The project has included members from Kyuss, Fu Manchu, Soundgarden, Monster Magnet, Goatsnake, earthlings? and Eagles of Death Metal, as well as PJ Harvey, Dean Ween and others associated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palm</b> Desert scene. Also in 1997, Roadrunner Records released the stoner rock compilation Burn One Up! Music for Stoners, which includes many of the aforementioned bands, as well as a track by Josh Homme's new band Queens of the Stone Age.|$|E
25|$|Regardless of the {{controversy}} and the delay in relieving Bee, Jackson's brigade, which would thenceforth {{be known as the}} Stonewall Brigade, stopped the Union assault and suffered more casualties than any other Southern brigade that day; Jackson has since then been generally known as Stonewall Jackson. During the battle, Jackson displayed a gesture common to him and held his left arm skyward <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> facing forward – interpreted by his soldiers variously as an eccentricity or an entreaty to God for success in combat. His hand was struck by a bullet or a piece of shrapnel and he suffered a small loss of bone in his middle finger. He refused medical advice to have the finger amputated. After the battle, Jackson was promoted to major general (October 7, 1861) and given command of the Valley District, with headquarters in Winchester.|$|E

25|$|As a guitarist Perkins used finger picking, {{imitations of}} the pedal steel guitar, {{right-handed}} damping (muffling strings near the bridge <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>palm),</b> arpeggios, advantageous use of open strings, single and double string bending (pushing strings across the neck {{to raise their}} pitch), chromaticism (using notes outside of the scale), country and blues licks, and tritone and other tonality clashing licks (short phrases that include notes from other keys and move in logical, often symmetric patterns). A rich vocabulary of chords including sixth and thirteenth chords, ninth and add nine chords, and suspensions, show up in rhythm parts and solos. Free use of syncopations, chord anticipations (arriving at a chord change before the other players, often by an eighth-note) and crosspicking (repeating a three eighth-note pattern so that an accent falls variously on the upbeat or downbeat) are also in his bag of tricks.|$|E
25|$|In 1892, Francis Bellamy created {{what was}} known as the Bellamy salute. It started with the hand outstretched toward the flag, palm down, and ended <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> up. Because of the {{similarity}} between the Bellamy salute and the Nazi salute, which was adopted in Germany later, the US Congress stipulated that the hand-over-the-heart gesture as the salute to be rendered by civilians during the Pledge of Allegiance and the national anthem in the US would be the salute to replace the Bellamy salute. Removal of the Bellamy salute occurred on December 22, 1942, when Congress amended the Flag Code language first passed into law on June 22, 1942. Attached to bills passed in Congress in 2008 and then in 2009 (Section 301(b)(1)of title 36, United States Code), language was included which authorized all active duty military personnel and all veterans in civilian clothes to render a proper hand salute during the raising and lowering of the flag, when the colors are presented, and during the National Anthem.|$|E
25|$|If {{the match}} is not ended by a fall, {{technical}} fall, default, or disqualification, the referee then prepares both wrestlers {{to begin the}} second period. After the first period ends, one wrestler will have the choice of starting position in the second period. In dual meets, this {{is determined by the}} colored disk toss that took place before the meet began. In tournaments, the referee will toss a colored disk, with a green-colored side and a red-colored side, and the winner of that disk toss will have the choice of position. The wrestler could choose between the neutral position, or as is most commonly chosen to begin in a place called the referee's position on the mat. The referee's position has both wrestlers beginning action {{at the center of the}} mat with one wrestler (in the defensive starting position) on the bottom with his hands spread apart in front of the forward starting line and his knees spread apart behind the rear starting line with his legs held together. The other wrestler on the top (in the offensive starting position) then kneels beside him with one arm wrapped around the bottom wrestler's waist (<b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> of his hand against the opponent's navel) and the other hand on or over the back of the opponent's near elbow for control. Most often, the wrestler with the choice chooses the defensive (bottom) position because of the relative ease of scoring an escape or reversal in comparison to a near fall. The wrestler could also defer his choice to the beginning of the third period.|$|E

500|$|The {{origin of}} tennis {{lies in the}} monastic cloisters in 12th-century France, where the ball was struck <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> of the hand in a game called jeu de paume. Rackets were {{introduced}} to the game in the early 16th century. This original version of tennis, now called [...] "real tennis", was mostly played indoors and popular among the royalty and gentry, while a crude outdoor version called longue paume was played by the populace. The prominence of the game declined in the 17th and 18th centuries, although there are sporadic mentions of a [...] "long tennis" [...] or [...] "field tennis" [...] version {{in the second half of}} the 18th century.|$|E
500|$|In Islamic {{countries}} and cultures, a gesture involving exposing only the thumb in a vertical orientation – a thumbs up – {{is used in}} lieu of the finger to express roughly the same sentiment. A similarly obscene gesture is extending all five digits <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> facing forward, meaning [...] "you have five fathers", thus calling someone a bastard. This is similar to a gesture known in Greece as the Moutza, where the five fingers are spread wide and the palm is pushed towards the recipient. More commonly in Turkish or Slavic regions, the fig sign (also known as nah or shish) serves as the equivalent to the finger, meaning [...] "you won't get it"/"in your dreams". The gesture is typically made with the hand and fingers curled and the thumb thrust between the middle and index fingers. This gesture is also used similarly in Indonesia, Turkey and China.|$|E
500|$|In October 2002, at age 34, Wotton {{was elected}} to his second term as {{councilor}} on the Palm Island Aboriginal Shire Council in an ATSIC Regional Council elections where {{he was one of}} eight nominations seeking two positions. In May 2003, Wotton supported a group of Palm Island women who called for the resignation of council chairwoman Delena Foster, asserting that she [...] "diminished the rights of all islanders by proposing a strict new alcohol ban" [...] as well as threatening a significant source of income for the area. Eleven days later, Wotton stated that the council had only $600,000 left in its reserves to run the island until the end of June – a claim chairwoman Foster heatedly disputed by saying that the council in fact had $1.5 million. By the end of June, Wotton became fed up <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palm</b> Island Aboriginal Council's practices and handed in his resignation, reasoning that in the 3½ years he was on the council, the body did not achieve one long-term success.|$|E
