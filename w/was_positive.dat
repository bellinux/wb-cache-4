5|$|The series proved {{popular with}} American audiences and {{critical}} response, though sparse, <b>was</b> <b>positive.</b> Flash Gordon has garnered little modern critical attention.

30|$|Suppose that A <b>is</b> <b>positive</b> {{definite}} (semidefinite), {{then all}} H-eigenvalues of A <b>are</b> <b>positive</b> (nonnegative). By (vi) and (ix) of Theorem 3, P_π (A) is an even-order symmetric tensor, and σ (P_π (A))=σ (A). From the results above, {{we know that}} all H-eigenvalues of P_π (A) <b>are</b> <b>positive</b> (nonnegative). Then, by Lemma 1, P_π (A) <b>is</b> <b>positive</b> definite (positive semidefinite).|$|R
5|$|After Mao Zedong purged Peng in 1959, Mao {{appointed}} Marshal He Long to {{the head}} of an office to investigate Peng's past in order to find additional reasons to criticize Peng. He accepted the position but was sympathetic to Peng, and stalled for over a year before submitting his report. Mao's prestige weakened when it became widely known that Mao's Great Leap Forward had been a disaster, and He eventually presented a report that <b>was</b> <b>positive,</b> and which attempted to vindicate Peng.|$|E
5|$|An {{anonymous}} {{review of}} Srigala Item in the Surabaya-based daily Soerabaijasch Handelsblad <b>was</b> <b>positive,</b> predicting the film {{would be a}} commercial success. This prediction was fulfilled, as Srigala Item reached extensive audiences– mostly lower-class natives. The Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran credits this success to escapism. He writes that the film's theme of an oppressed, financially destitute youth {{who is able to}} control his destiny by becoming a masked vigilante, allowed viewers {{to be able to see}} themselves as the Black Wolf, and thus take revenge against those who had wronged them.|$|E

5|$|Critical {{reception}} to Dynamite Headdy <b>was</b> <b>positive.</b> Critics {{highlighted the}} game's originality and creativity in distinguishing it among other {{games in the}} action-platform genre. They also commended Treasure for demonstrating their technical expertise with impressive graphical effects and building {{on the success of}} their earlier game Gunstar Heroes (1993). In reviews from the time and in retrospect, Dynamite Headdy is cited for being one of the best games on the Genesis. An 8-bit port was released for Game Gear, which itself served as the basis for a Master System port released exclusively in Brazil.|$|E
5|$|DotA {{became a}} feature at several {{worldwide}} tournaments, including Blizzard Entertainment's BlizzCon and the Asian World Cyber Games. Critical reception to DotA <b>was</b> <b>positive,</b> with it being {{called one of}} the most popular mods of any game. DotA is largely attributed to being the most significant inspiration for the multiplayer online battle arena genre. American video game developer Valve Corporation acquired the intellectual property rights to DotA in 2009 to develop a stand-alone sequel, Dota 2, which released in July 2013.|$|E

5|$|Micro Machines was {{developed}} because Galoob wanted Codemasters {{to develop a}} game based on their toy brand, although Galoob and Codemasters encountered legal issues with Nintendo over the game being unlicensed. Micro Machines was ported to several systems, and received remakes for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, and GameCube in 2002. Micro Machiness reception <b>was</b> <b>positive,</b> with reviewers praising the originality and two-player mode, although some criticised the sprites on some versions. A sequel, , was released in 1994, and the series was revived in 2016 {{with the release of}} a title for iOS and Android.|$|E

The Mega Drive update was also well received, but some reviewers criticised it {{for being too}} similar to the original. Due to the game's success, a spin-off, Micro Machines Military was produced and released in 1996, and a sequel, Micro Machines V3, in 1997.|$|E
40|$|Skin {{tumors are}} tumors arising from {{keratinocyte}} and from adnexal structures. Immunohistochemistry is {{very helpful in}} diagnosis of difficult cases in epithelial skin neoplasms, especially basal cell carcinoma (BCC) which <b>is</b> <b>positive</b> for BerEP 4, a keratin marker, and mostly negative for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA). Squamous cell carcinoma cells <b>are</b> <b>positive</b> for EMA and cytokeratin, which are of higher molecular weight than those found in BCC. In contrast to BCC, trichoblastoma and trichoepithelioma are negative for androgen receptors. Of the malignant dermal spindle cell lesions, spindle cell squamous carcinoma <b>is</b> <b>positive</b> to 34 betaE 12, desmoplasmic melanoma <b>is</b> <b>positive</b> to S 100, and leiomyosarcoma <b>is</b> <b>positive</b> to desmin. Of the malignant pagetoid cells, Paget′s disease <b>is</b> <b>positive</b> to CK 7 and cam 5. 2, whereas the pagetoid variant of Bowen′s disease <b>is</b> <b>positive</b> to CK 5 / 6. Melanoma in-situ <b>is</b> <b>positive</b> to both S 100 and melan-A. Immunohistochemistry is an extremely valuable adjunct to standard morphologic diagnosis in diagnostic pathology. Diagnosis of epithelial tumor depends largely on morphological features but, in rare cases, immunohistochemical stains are needed for definitive diagnosis...|$|R

Reception after the add-on's unveiling and launch <b>was</b> <b>positive,</b> highlighting the low price {{of the system and}} power expansion to the Genesis.
