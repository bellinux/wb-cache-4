40|$|During {{the period}} 1964 — 69 {{investigations}} {{were carried out}} on the composition of fish species caught with purse seine for herring and sprat in Norwegian fjords. In the districts of Hordaland and Sogn og Fjordane {{on the west coast}} of Norway 70 catches were examined. The greater part of the hauls were made by artificial light during the months of August to November. Besides herring and sprat, 27 other fish species were found in the purse seine catches. Among these the most frequent species was <b>whiting</b> (<b>Merlangus</b> <b>merlangus)</b> which was found in most of the seine catches taken by artificial light. The number of whiting usually was from 20 to 50, sometimes even up to 300. In some deeper fjords on the west coast two other gadoid fishes. i. e. blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou) and Norway pout (Boreogadus esmarkii) were common in catches taken by artificial light. In one single haul in the Osterfjord 2400 blue whiting and 6000 Norway pout were found. In the autumn of 1966 a large number of sand eels (Ammodytes lancea) were present in catches from {{the southern part of the}} area. This species seemed to be strongly attracted by artificial light, and up to 200 hectolitres could be caught in one night by a single boat. In the deep fjords the bycatches were generally small. Common food fish as cod (Gadus morhua) and haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) were only found in purse seine catches from closed inlets or in shallow and narrow fjords. Our material so far indicates that on the west coast of Norway the catches of other species than herring and sprat in the purse seine catches obtained by use of artificial light are not of such a quantity that they could be detrimental to other commercial fisheries...|$|E

Analyses of the stomach contents revealed that they fed almost exclusively upon the marine mysid Praunus neglectus and other macroinverte-brates such as Hyperia galba and Crangon allmani. Piscivorous feeding, including cannibalism, was also evident, and three fish species were recorded in the smelt stomach contents (<b>Merlangus</b> <b>merlangus,</b> Sprattus sprattus and Osmerus eperlanus). Seasonal variation in feeding intensity was also noted. Six metazoan parasite species were recorded from the Waterford Estuary smelt.

40|$|Carbon stable {{isotopes}} {{can be used}} {{to trace}} the sources of energy supporting food chains and to estimate the contribution of different sources to a consumer's diet. However, the d 13 C signature of a consumer is not sufficient to infer source without an appropriate isotopic baseline, because {{there is no way to}} determine if differences in consumer d 13 C reflect source changes or baseline variation. Describing isotopic baselines is a considerable challenge when applying stable isotope techniques at large spatial scales and/or to interconnected food chains in open marine environments. One approach is to use filter-feeding consumers to integrate the high frequency and small-scale variation in the isotopic signature of phytoplankton and provide a surrogate baseline, but it can be difficult to sample a single consumer species at large spatial scales owing to rarity and/or discontinuous distribution. Here, we use the isotopic signature of a widely distributed filter-feeder (the queen scallop Aequipecten opercularis) in the north-eastern Atlantic to develop a model linking base d 13 C to environmental variables. Remarkably, a single variable model based on bottom temperature has good predictive power and predicts scallop d 13 C with mean error of only 0. 6 ‰ (3 %). When the model was used to predict an isotopic baseline in parts of the overall study region where scallop were not consistently sampled, the model accounted for 76 % and 79 % of the large-scale spatial variability (101 - 104 km) of the d 13 C of two fish species (dab Limanda limanda and <b>whiting</b> <b>Merlangus</b> merlangius) and 44 % of the d 13 C variability in a mixed fish community. The results show that source studies would be significantly biased if a single baseline were applied to food webs at larger scales.

This method was applied to images of a whiting before and after amputation, in a Newtonian frame of reference and an “anterior-body-fixed ” frame as well. The fish motions were well represented by a single complex mode, which was then used as a modal filter. The extracted mode and modal coordinate were used to estimate the frequency, wavelength, and wave speed.

40|$|Nephrops norvegicus (Norway lobster or prawn) is an {{important}} target species in demersal fisheries of the north-east Atlantic. Trawling for Nephrops is wasteful when many small fish are caught and discarded in the process. Here, data from 106 commercial fishing trips, sampled between 1982 and 1998 {{as part of the}} Scottish discard sampling programme, are used to investigate the fish bycatch and discards of Nephrops trawlers in the Firth of Clyde (west of Scotland). A large proportion of the fish caught in the Clyde is discarded, the discards mainly consisting of small demersal fish (mean length about 19 cm), particularly young <b>whiting</b> (Merlangius <b>merlangus).</b> Within the study period, annual estimates of total fish discards ranged from 318 to 3 027 tonnes, with a mean of 1 761 tonnes. Fish landings and discards biomass per unit effort both decreased over the study period. However, the decline in landings per unit effort was greater than that in discards per unit effort, corresponding to an increase in the discard rate over time. In recent years, discards have comprised about 70 % of the fish bycatch. The mean length of discarded fish was positively related to mesh size...|$|R
40|$|Many commercially {{important}} {{marine fishes}} {{are found in}} estuaries, particularly as juveniles. The estuaries may provide a thermal resource, refuge from predators {{and a source of}} abundant prey. Here, carbon (d 13 C) and sulphur (d 34 S) stable isotope data from coastally caught common sole (Solea solea) and <b>whiting</b> (Merlangius <b>merlangus)</b> were used in independent mixing models to determine relative contributions of estuarine prey to white muscle composition. The influence of assumed trophic fractionation was also investigated with sensitivity analysis. At the population level, there was evidence for estuarine contributions to muscle tissue in both species (means from 16. 37 % to 61. 28 %), though among-individual variability was considerable. d 13 C and d 34 S model outputs implied different estuarine contributions for the same individual, likely reflecting the slower turnover of d 34 S than d 13 C. Sole exhibited population level plasticity in their feeding as juveniles, separating into two distinct juvenile sub-populations; but they are less plastic as older fish when they adopt increasingly marine diets. Whiting show individual plasticity as both juveniles and adults, feeding on prey of estuarine and coastal origin...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{mathematical}} derivation is presented that links von Bertalanffy's growth model {{with the concept}} of net conversion efficiency of Beverton and Holt, aiming at the development of an equation that can calculate food consumption rates of wild populations from parameters of the von Bertalanffy growth equation and an estimate of the net food conversion efficiency of Beverton and Holt. The derivation is based on Pauly's version of the generalized von Bertalanffy equation, which allows the allometric exponent of the anabolism term to differ from 2 / 3, as in the standard von Bertalanffy equation. As a side product, a general model is formulated that describes the gross growth conversion efficiency (K- 1 of Ivlev) as a function of weight of the organism. The new equations for the estimation of food consumption are applied in two case studies, North Sea cod (Gadus morhua) and <b>whiting</b> (Merlangius <b>merlangus),</b> for which a variety of consumption estimates is available from conventional gastric evacuation-based methods. The new method produces results that show a similar degree of variability as was observed in various applications of the gastric evacuation method...|$|R
