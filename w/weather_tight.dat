He had the marble towers replaced with the lower, enclosed, copper dome-tipped towers that still top the basilica today. Following the harsh winter of 2001-2002, the roof of the National Shrine was found to have significantly deteriorated. Its copper had turned a greenish hue due to overexposure to the elements (a similar chemical effect as seen on the Statue of Liberty) and was no longer <b>weather</b> <b>tight.</b> A new copper roof was installed.|$|E

30|$|The {{industrial}} {{modular construction}} is one special {{type of construction}} methods commonly adopted in Northern Alberta {{for oil and gas}} projects (Taghaddos et al. 2012). Modularization can reduce the construction cost and duration; also materialize quality and safety objectives under inclement <b>weather</b> conditions and <b>tight</b> labor availability constraints. Spool fabrication is an early process of one industrial construction project and is crucial to the success of entire project delivery (Wang et al. 2009). Pre-fabrication generally takes place at a specified facility (e.g., fabrication shop), where various materials are conjoined as per the engineering design in order to form a component part of a larger item. Any component that is fabricated off-site and is not a complete system in function can be considered to be pre-fabricated (Taghaddos et al. 2012).|$|R
30|$|Method 4 In this method, {{a single}} sample was exposed in a gas <b>tight</b> <b>weathering</b> chamber to a {{well-defined}} atmosphere. A gas mixing unit provided the corrosive atmosphere, where synthetic air {{is mixed with}} any amount of relative humidity (0 – 95 % RH) and acidifying gas (H 2 S, SO 2) to simulate real world atmospheric corrosion conditions [34, 35]. In this method, a polished Ag 925 coupon was exposed to a controlled gaseous atmosphere consisting of synthetic air, 90 % RH, 500  ppb H 2 S and 500  ppb SO 2. For the first 24  h of weathering the samples were exposed to 90 % RH and 500  ppb H 2 S followed by 90 % RH and 500  ppb SO 2 for another 48  h, leading to a total weathering time in sulfur containing environment of 72  h.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} design to fulfil {{the objectives of}} this study is summarised in Figure 3. To achieve this, Pre-visit questionnaires (Appendix 1) were sent to people intending to visit Tiritiri Matangi Island or Little Barrier Island. These were posted approximately 2 weeks prior to a visit, allowing time for completion and postal return before the island visit was Matching Post-visit questionnaires were sent immediately after the island visits, when the visit experiences could be easily recalled. This approach allowed a before-and-after assessment of visitor responses. Visitor names and addresses were collected from permit applications for Little Barrier visitors, and from trip lists sent to Department of Conservation staff for Tiritiri Matangi visitors. Tiritiri Matangi visitors not on trip lists, or who decided to visit at short notice (on the day) could not be included by this method. The overall response rates for the postal surveys are shown in Table 1. Only those respondents who completed both the pre-visit and post-visit sections of the survey were included in the final analyses. Given the difficulties of a pre- and post-visit survey methodology, and the schedule of questionnaire post-outs having to follow <b>weather</b> dependent and <b>tight</b> trip timetables, the survey response rates were considered satisfactory. Sample sizes were affected by the number of visitors who went, the availability of the participant lists to the researcher and the cancellations of trips (e. g., due to weather). Figure 4. Response rates to the survey. To maximise response, stamped return-addressed envelopes were provided, and two follow-up letters were sent to those who had not completed questionnaires...|$|R
50|$|This {{high degree}} of {{prefabrication}} means buildings can be manufactured and erected extremely quickly and efficiently.

Private maternity hospitals, {{owned and operated by}} midwives, were once common throughout Queensland. The building has remained in the family of the nursing sister who ran the hospital. Its current form also illustrates the common tendency since World War Two to enclose verandahs, providing more <b>weather</b> <b>tight</b> space., often in response to cyclone damage. It is otherwise little changed.|$|E
50|$|A new {{restoration}} effort {{began in}} October 2013 to repair stonework {{and make the}} fountains operable again. In 2013 the bronze elements were cleaned and treated with wax sealant. In 2014 Preservation Massachusetts designated the Johnson Memorial Gates {{as one of the}} Massachusetts Most Endangered Historic Resources. In 2015 funding from the Browne Fund restored the two horse troughs and provided <b>weather</b> <b>tight</b> covers on Hemenway Street. For fiscal year 2017 the city of Boston has approved $820,000 for Johnson Memorial Gates monument conservation, accessibility upgrades, and landscape rehabilitation.|$|E
40|$|Marine {{renewable}} energy (MRE) is an emerging technology and at present {{there are an}} increasing number of MRE prototypes and full-scale devices deployed. The future commercialization in the near future may contribute to the mitigation of carbon emissions and diversify the renewable electricity generation portfolio. Because of the high costs of marine intervention, it is important to establish reliable, remote monitoring techniques. The underwater sound around MRE devices is often monitored for environmental impact assessments. This approach can also be potentially utilized to monitor the engineering health of MRE devices. This is the objective of the project ÆMORE (Acoustic Emission technology for environmental and engineering health Monitoring of Offshore Renewable Energy), jointly conducted by the Universities of Exeter and Bath, with J+S Ltd. Acoustic Emission (AE) monitoring is already used for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) of land-based structures and devices such as wind turbines. AE allows faults and defects to be detected early in a device's lifetime, providing more time to plan and implement necessary maintenance and repair procedures to avoid catastrophic failure. This is highly desirable for MRE structures, which operate in energetic seas with <b>tight</b> <b>weather</b> access windows. This paper explores the remit for AE monitoring to SHM and maintenance planning for MRE devices and demonstrates that this novel application is principally feasible. A brief review {{of the state of the}} art of AE for land-based systems aids to illustrate how its techniques can be applied to underwater environments and MRE components. This literature review will inform a classification system that relates likely failure modes to their expected acoustic emissions. The results from previous underwater environmental studies are used to evaluate their potential for SHM of MRE structures. AE environmental data collected during the operation of the Fred Olsen Lifesaver wave energy converter at the Falmouth Bay Test site (FaBTest, SW UK) is used to demonstrate this novel application. The case study provides proof that this concept is valid for underwater SHM of marine renewable structures...|$|R

50|$|The {{simplicity}} of the top-bar hive allows use of salvage materials and even boxes and containers such as half-drums, drawers and packing crates. Almost any container {{may be used as}} a hive, provided appropriate bars are placed across the top and a <b>weather</b> <b>tight</b> cover and a single defensible entrance are provided. While this is an advantage in impoverished areas, purpose-built hives offer certain advantages in pest control, durability, and defensibility. While hives in a beeyard should use identical bars for convenience in management, the construction does not require the precise dimensional control of the Langstroth type.|$|E

5000|$|Historically {{log cabin}} {{construction}} {{has its roots}} in Scandinavia and Eastern Europe. Although their origin is uncertain, the first log structures were probably being built in Northern Europe by the Bronze Age (about 3500 BC). C. A. Weslager describes Europeans as having: [...] "...accomplished in building several forms of log housing, having different methods of corner timbering, and they utilized both round and hewn logs. Their log building had undergone an evolutionary process from the crude [...] "pirtti"...a small gabled-roof cabin of round logs with an opening in the roof to vent smoke, to more sophisticated squared logs with interlocking double-notch joints, the timber extending beyond the corners. Log saunas or bathhouses of this type are still found in rural Finland."By stacking tree trunks one on top of another and overlapping the logs at the corners, people made the [...] "log cabin". They developed interlocking corners by notching the logs at the ends, resulting in strong structures that were easier to make weather-tight by inserting moss or other soft material into the joints. As the original coniferous forest extended over the coldest parts of the world, there was a prime need to keep these cabins warm. The insulating properties of the solid wood were a great advantage over a timber frame construction covered with animal skins, felt, boards or shingles. Over the decades, increasingly complex jointswere developed to ensure more <b>weather</b> <b>tight</b> joints between the logs, but the profiles were still largely based on the round log. C. A. Weslager [...] Nevertheless, a medieval log cabin was considered movable property (a chattel house), as evidenced by the relocation of Espåby village in 1557: the buildings were simply disassembled, transported to a new location and reassembled. It was also common to replace individual logs damaged by dry rot as necessary.|$|E
40|$|A {{bistable}} airfoil {{with the}} actuator {{system and the}} aerodynamic loads coupled to the structure is designed to understand the aeroelastic characteristics of the system. The bistable flap consists of a stack of six bistable prestressed buckled laminates with the plates having dimensions of 100 × 100 mm made from Hexcel 913 glass fiber. The bistable plates attached to a spar situated at 85 % chord on the rotor blade. The foam tape placed between each of the plates at the trailing edge making the airfoil <b>weather</b> <b>tight.</b> The bistable plate spar {{is parallel to the}} direction of motion of the moving crosshead of the test machine. For the flap to be in equilibrium without any actuator input, the sum of the work done on the structure by the aerodynamic loads W f and the work done on the aerodynamic loads by the structure W b is zero. The modulus function shows that the work needs to be done on the structure to rotate the flap in either direction from an equilibrium point whereas the work done on the aerodynamic loads is dependant on direction...|$|E
40|$|Many modern {{warships}} have enclosed main masts {{that are}} bulky and very different to the lattice or pole masts of earlier ships. While the newer masts are carefully {{designed to reduce}} radar cross section, and provide a <b>weather</b> <b>tight</b> enclosure for sensors and systems, they also significantly affect the air flow over the ship. This paper reports some results from a CFD study of the air flow over a generic ship representative of a modern frigate with an enclosed mast. Specific {{attention has been paid}} to the unsteady velocities at locations around the mast where a ship’s anemometer might typically be placed. The flow is seen to be highly disturbed and both the wind strength and angle are significantly different to those of the free stream, hence making a true wind over deck measurement difficult. In the context of helicopter launch and recovery this makes it difficult to specify the helicopter’s operational limits which can restrict operational capability. The study has also quantified the temperature field due to the ship’s exhaust gas, and shows how vortex shedding from the mast mixes the exhaust gas with the airwake, so quenching the hot gases and reducing temperatures over the flight deck...|$|E
40|$|Many {{forms of}} {{electronic}} {{equipment such as}} battery packs and telecom equipment must be stored in harsh outdoor environment. It is essential that these facilities be protected {{from a wide range}} of ambient temperatures and solar radiation. Temperature extremes greatly reduce lead-acid based battery performance and shorten battery life. Therefore, it is important to maintain the cabinet temperature within the optimal values between 20 oC and 30 oC to ensure battery stability and to extend battery lifespan. To this end, cabinet enclosures with proper thermal management have been developed to house such electronic equipment in a highly <b>weather</b> <b>tight</b> manner, especially for battery cabinet. In this paper, the flow field and temperature distribution inside an outdoor cabinet are studied experimentally and numerically. The battery cabinets house 24 batteries in two configurations namely, two-layer configuration and six-layer configuration respectively. The cabinet walls are maintained at a constant temperature by a refrigeration system. The cabinet’s ability to protect the batteries from an ambient temperature as high as 50 oC is studied. An experimental facility is developed to measure the battery surface temperatures and to validate the numerical simulations.

40|$|Many {{forms of}} {{electronic}} equipment, of necessity, must {{be located in}} an outdoor environment. Such equipment in typical form may be battery packs or telecom-equipment. It is essential that these facilities be protected {{from a wide range}} of ambient temperatures and solar radiation. To this end, cabinet enclosures with proper thermal management have been developed to house such electronic equipment in a highly <b>weather</b> <b>tight</b> manner, especially for battery cabinet. Often the batteries are of a lead-acid construction which is known to be adversely affected by temperature extremes in terms of battery performance and life. Therefore, it is important to maintain the cabinet temperature ideally for ensuring battery stability and extending battery lifespan. In this paper, physical and mathematical models are established to investigate the flow field and temperature distribution inside an outdoor cabinet, which contains 24 batteries with two configurations of two-layer and six-layer respectively. The cabinet walls are maintained at a constant temperature by a refrigeration system and the ambient temperature is up to 50 °C according to the practical situation. The flow field and temperature distribution are analyzed with and without consideration of solar radiation. An experimental facility is then developed to measure the battery surface temperatures and to validate the numerical simulation. The differences between the CFD and experimental results are within 2...|$|E
40|$|The cost {{of housing}} in the U. S. {{continues}} to rise faster than household income. Innovative building materials and construction technologies {{have the potential to}} reduce housing construction costs. One strategy to do this is componentization. There is a longstanding trend towards the increased use of components in U. S. residential construction. One such type of component is the composite building panel, used for walls, roofs and floors. Presently the types of composite panels used in residential construction include pre-framed walls of standard construction and, more innovatively, structural foam core panels with wood or wood composite faces. This thesis focuses on the design of a panelized roofing system for residential construction. The roof was chosen for various reasons. It includes some of the most complicated geometrical and structural challenges. It is often the most difficult area of the house to frame conventionally. Its construction is a crucial step in getting the house <b>weather</b> <b>tight.</b> For these reasons and others builders have identified it as a prime target for innovation. The design of the panelized roof system is illustrated as a tree of decisions. The path traveled down this tree led to a ribbed panel spanning from eave to ridge. A design selection method developed by Stuart Pugh was used to design the connection details of the system. The interdisciplinary design process used to design the roof system is examined and evaluated in light of the results it yielded. Mock-ups, models and a full scale proof-of-concept structure were built. These constructions were used as learning tools during design and to demonstrate and evaluate the performance of the roof system design. by Jordan Lewis Dentz. Thesis (M. S.)
