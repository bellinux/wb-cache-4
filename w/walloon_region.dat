It stayed on the charts for 19 weeks, and made two re-entries, one in June 2003 and other in August 2003.|$|E
25|$|The term Wallonia {{can mean}} {{slightly}} different things in different contexts. One {{of the three}} federal regions of Belgium is still constitutionally defined as the <b>Walloon</b> <b>Region,</b> but the region's government has renamed it Wallonia, and it is commonly called Wallonia. Preceding 1 April 2010, when the renaming came into effect, Wallonia would sometimes refer to the territory governed by the <b>Walloon</b> <b>Region,</b> whereas <b>Walloon</b> <b>Region</b> referred specifically to the government. In practice, {{the difference between the}} two terms is small and what is meant is usually clear, based on context.|$|E
25|$|The {{territory}} of Belgium {{is divided into}} three Regions, two of which, the Flemish Region and <b>Walloon</b> <b>Region,</b> are in turn subdivided into provinces; the third Region, the Brussels Capital Region, is neither a province nor a part of a province.|$|E
5000|$|Hervé Hasquin said, [...] "the {{development}} of the <b>Walloon</b> industrial <b>regions</b> contributed to make Belgium {{one of the main}} industrial powers in Europe, if not in the world ..." [...] Philippe Raxhon wrote that after 1830, [...] "the <b>Walloon</b> <b>regions</b> were becoming the second industrial power in the world after England". Marc Reynebau said the same thing.|$|R
50|$|Second state reform (1980) - Cultural {{communities}} become communities, {{with more}} competences related to personal matters. Territorial Flemish and <b>Walloon</b> <b>regions</b> established (Brussels Region later). Communities and Regions {{get their own}} Parliaments and Governments.|$|R
50|$|Wind {{turbines}} {{are mainly}} installed offshore {{and in the}} Flemish and <b>Walloon</b> <b>Regions.</b> Brussels-Capital Region is an urban area which is not particularly suited for large wind turbines. Smaller turbines more appropriate for urban environments are being studied but until today no technology is deemed sufficiently efficient.|$|R
25|$|The {{region was}} placed on equal footing with the Flemish Region and the <b>Walloon</b> <b>Region.</b> Nonetheless, Brussels does not have its own community; rather the Flemish Community and the French Community both have {{jurisdiction}} in Brussels. The Flemish Community Commission (VGC) and the French Community Commission (COCOF) were to act on their respective Communities' behalf in Brussels. Brussels divides its funding for the Communities between them, with 20% going to the VGC, and 80% to the COCOF.|$|E
25|$|The {{overlapping}} {{boundaries of}} the Regions and Communities have created two notable peculiarities: {{the territory of the}} Brussels-Capital Region (which came into existence nearly a decade after the other regions) is included in both the Flemish and French Communities, and the territory of the German-speaking Community lies wholly within the <b>Walloon</b> <b>Region.</b> Conflicts about jurisdiction between the bodies are resolved by the Constitutional Court of Belgium. The structure is intended as a compromise to allow different cultures to live together peacefully.|$|E
25|$|Belgium is {{a federal}} state made up of three {{communities}} and three regions, each with considerable autonomy. One {{of these is the}} <b>Walloon</b> <b>Region,</b> which is governed by the Parliament of Wallonia and the executive Walloon Government. The Walloon Region's autonomy extends even to foreign policy; Wallonia is entitled to pursue its own foreign policy, including the signing of treaties, and in many domains even the Belgian federal government is not able to sign an international treaty without the agreement of the Parliament of Wallonia.|$|E
50|$|The word “peket” means “prickly” in old Walloon. Other {{sources tell}} that this word {{was used by}} miners. It {{certainly}} comes from the Walloon word “pèke”, which means juniper berry in some <b>Walloon</b> <b>regions.</b> This name was used afterwards in Wallonia, for an eau de vie aromatised with these berries.|$|R
5000|$|Healthcare in Belgium {{is mainly}} the {{responsibility}} of the federal minister and the [...] "FOD Volksgezondheid en Sociale Zekerheid / SPF Santé Publique et Securité Sociale" [...] ("Public Administration for Public Health and Social Security"). The responsibility is exercised by the governments of the Flemish, <b>Walloon</b> <b>regions</b> and the German-speaking community. Both the Belgian federal government and the Regional governments have ministers for public health and a supportive administrative civil service.|$|R
5000|$|The {{complexity}} of the Belgian political landscape makes some transportation issues difficult to solve. The Brussels Capital Region is surrounded by the Flemish and <b>Walloon</b> <b>regions,</b> {{which means that the}} airports, as well as many roads serving Brussels (most notably the Brussels Ring) are located in the other two Belgian regions. Furthermore, in the Brussels Region itself, two ministers are currently responsible for transport: [...] for public transport and the port of Brussels and [...] for other transportation topics.|$|R
25|$|The <b>Walloon</b> <b>Region</b> has a unicameral {{parliament}} with 75 members elected {{for five}} years by direct universal suffrage, and an executive, the Walloon Government, elected by a political majority in Parliament. The Government numbers nine members with the president. Each member is called a Walloon minister. The head of the Government is called the Minister-President of Wallonia. The coalition government for the 2014–2019 legislature was a center-left coalition PS-cdH until July 28 when it {{was replaced by a}} center-left coalition MR-cdH, and the current Minister-President is Willy Borsus.|$|E
25|$|The Brussels-Capital Region {{is one of}} {{the three}} federated regions of Belgium, {{alongside}} the <b>Walloon</b> <b>Region</b> and the Flemish Region. Geographically and linguistically, it is a bilingual enclave in the monolingual Flemish Region. Regions are one component of Belgium's institutions, the three communities being the other component: Brussels' inhabitants deal with either the French Community or the Flemish Community for matters such as culture and education, as well as a Common Community for competencies which do not belong exclusively to either Community, such as healthcare and assistance to individuals.|$|E
25|$|Luxembourg was {{the first}} city to be named European Capital of Culture twice. The first time was in 1995. In 2007, along with the Romanian city Sibiu, the European Capital of Culture {{was to be a}} {{cross-border}} area consisting of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Rheinland-Pfalz and Saarland in Germany, the <b>Walloon</b> <b>Region</b> and the German-speaking part of Belgium, and the Lorraine area in France. The event was an attempt to promote mobility and the exchange of ideas, crossing borders in all areas, physical, psychological, artistic and emotional.|$|E
50|$|The {{amount paid}} to each region {{reflects}} {{the gap in}} the yield of personal income tax in the region in relation to the national average, weighted by an indexing factor and a factor pertaining to the amounts received by beneficiaries when the system was introduced. Due to their inferior fiscal capacity, the Brussels and <b>Walloon</b> <b>regions</b> are recipients of NSB/ISN transfers. The region of Flanders does not receive funding under this program as its fiscal capacity lies above the national average.|$|R
50|$|Regional {{transport}} in Belgium {{is operated}} by regional companies: De Lijn in Flanders operates the Kusttram and the Antwerp pre-metro {{as well as}} a bus network, TEC in Wallonia operates the Charleroi pre-metro {{as well as a}} bus network and MIVB/STIB in the Brussels Capital-Region operates the Brussels metro as well as the Brussels tram and bus network. Despite this regional organization, some bus and tram routes operated by STIB/MIVB go beyond the regional border, and some bus routes operated by TEC or De Lijn transport passengers from the Flemish or <b>Walloon</b> <b>regions</b> to the capital city or in the other regions.|$|R
50|$|First state reform (1970) - Cultural {{communities}} established (Flemish demand). Constitutional {{foundations for}} territorial <b>regions</b> (<b>Walloon</b> demand).|$|R
25|$|The French Community Commission {{has also}} another capacity: some {{legislative}} {{powers of the}} French Community have been devolved to the <b>Walloon</b> <b>Region</b> (for the French language area of Belgium) and to the French Community Commission (for the bilingual language area). The Flemish Community, however, did the opposite; it merged the Flemish Region into the Flemish Community. This is related to different conceptions in the two communities, one focusing more on the Communities and the other more on the Regions, causing an asymmetrical federalism. Because of this devolution, the French Community Commission can enact decrees, which are legislative acts.|$|E
25|$|The second state reform {{took place}} in 1980, when the {{cultural}} communities became Communities. The Communities assumed the competencies of the cultural communities with regard to cultural matters, and became responsible for the 'matters relating to the person', such as health and youth policy. From then on, these three Communities were known as the Flemish Community, the French Community and the German-speaking Community. Two Regions were established as well in 1980: the Flemish Region and the <b>Walloon</b> <b>Region.</b> However, in Flanders it was decided in 1980 to immediately merge {{the institutions of the}} Community and the Region. Although the creation of a Brussels Region was provided for in 1970, the Brussels-Capital Region was not established until the third state reform.|$|E
25|$|Of {{businesses}} {{based in}} Brussels, 50% use French for internal business, while 32% use French and Dutch, the others {{using a variety}} of other languages. More than a third of job openings require bilingualism, and a fifth of job openings require knowledge of English. On account of this, it is argued that an increase in knowledge of Dutch in Brussels and Wallonia would significantly improve the prospects of job seekers in those regions. Of advertising campaigns in Brussels, 42% are bilingual French and Dutch, while 33% are in French only, 10% in French and English and 7% in English, French and Dutch. During the day, the percentage of Dutch-speakers in Brussels increases significantly, with 230,000 commuters coming from the Flemish Region, significantly more than the 130,000 coming from the <b>Walloon</b> <b>Region.</b> Many of those coming from the Flemish Region, however, especially from very close to Brussels, are French-speakers.|$|E
50|$|Since the 1993 State Reform, the {{environment}} is a regional responsibility, with the Flemish, <b>Walloon</b> and Brussels-Capital <b>Regions</b> responsible for environmental matters in their respective territories. This has led to differences in legislation and separation of measurements and publication of statistics.|$|R
2500|$|Wallonia {{exemplified}} {{the radical}} evolution of industrial expansion. Thanks to coal (the French word [...] "houille" [...] was coined in Wallonia), the region geared {{up to become}} the 2nd industrial {{power in the world}} after Britain. But it is also pointed out by many researchers, with its Sillon industriel, 'Especially in the Haine, Sambre and Meuse valleys, between the Borinage and Liège, (...) there was a huge industrial development based on coal-mining and iron-making...'. Philippe Raxhon wrote about the period after 1830: [...] "It was not propaganda but a reality the <b>Walloon</b> <b>regions</b> were becoming the second industrial power all over the world after Britain." [...] "The sole industrial centre outside the collieries and blast furnaces of Walloon was the old cloth making town of Ghent." [...] Michel De Coster, Professor at the Université de Liège wrote also: [...] "The historians and the economists say that Belgium was the second industrial power of the world, in proportion to its population and its territory (...) But this rank is the one of Wallonia where the coal-mines, the blast furnaces, the iron and zinc factories, the wool industry, the glass industry, the weapons industry... were concentrated." ...|$|R
5000|$|On 15 June 1985, at Louvain-la-Neuve (<b>Walloon</b> Brabant), 47 <b>Regions</b> and 9 interregional organisations {{founded the}} Council of the Regions of Europe (CRE), which {{would later become}} the Assembly of European Regions in November 1987 at the second General meeting of the Regions of Europe in Brussels.|$|R
25|$|On 27 February 1998, the French Community of Belgium and the <b>Walloon</b> <b>Region,</b> {{together}} with a French-speaking inhabitant {{of one of the}} concerned rim municipalities, challenged the legitimacy of the directive before the Council of State. On 27 March 2001, the court argued that two first plaintiffs did not have any powers within the territory of the Flemish Region, and dismissed the appeal on those grounds. The case of the French-speaking inhabitant was forwarded to a Dutch-speaking chamber (since the other two plaintiffs were removed from the case, the competetent chamber changed) and debates were reopened. On 25 February 1998, the municipality of Kraainem (in the periphery of Brussels, with a French-speaking majority) had initiated another case, also requesting annulment of the directive. On 28 May, Wemmel and Wezembeek-Oppem filed for intervention, joined by Drogenbos on 28 July 2008. The municipalities (and a number of French-speaking inhabitants) claimed that the directive introduced new rules, and thus conflicted with art. 129, §2 of the Constitution.|$|E

40|$|The {{integration}} of environmental concerns into agricultural policies - through agri-environment measures (AEM) - {{has seen a}} fast development across Europe. This paper conceives AEM as an evolving instrument, a product that takes shape, gets diffused and taken up in, by and through networks of relations. Success then depends on the mobilisation or active participation {{of all those who}} may support and develop it. Using the examples of the Flanders' and <b>Walloon</b> <b>regions</b> of Belgium, the paper sets out to examine the mechanisms by which mobilisation for agri-environmental management develops, and by doing so, {{to gain a better understanding}} of mobilisation capacity as a concept to be used for evaluating policy implementation in this area. The study follows AEM along the various trajectories of implementation (design, distribution, application). The findings reveal how mobilisation capacity is gradually built-up by the interplay between AEM and the networks it connects to. The case illustrates well how such interactions occur all the way from administration offices to farmers' fields, and that their nature can be very different (e. g., formal and informal, durable and short-lived, expected and unexpected). It is concluded that in evaluating actor-networks, one should look at them in an open and fluid manner, that is, not to privilege any particular configuration or form of attachment over the other, not take intentions and objectives as a starting point but instead address the opportunities for synergies, and be aware that any network built around the instrument may change its content and the way it functions. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

2500|$|Wallonia ( [...] , , [...] , [...] , , [...] ) is {{a region}} of Belgium. As the {{southern}} portion of the country, Wallonia is primarily French-speaking, and accounts for 55 percent of the territory of Belgium, {{and a third of}} its population. Unlike Flanders, the <b>Walloon</b> <b>Region</b> was not merged with the French Community of Belgium which is the political entity that is responsible for matters related mainly to culture and education.

[...] Following several state reforms, especially the 1993 state reform, Belgium became a federal state made up of three communities and three regions, with Wallonia being represented by the <b>Walloon</b> <b>Region</b> and its two language communities. The directly elected Walloon Parliament was created in June 1995, replacing the Conseil régional wallon (Regional Council of Wallonia).
