25|$|This axiomatization is by {{no means}} the only one, or even {{necessarily}} the most natural given that we did not pay attention to whether some of the axioms followed from others but simply chose to stop when we noticed <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> laws, treated further in the section on axiomatizations. Or the intermediate notion of axiom can be sidestepped altogether by defining a Boolean law directly as any tautology, understood as an equation that holds for all values of its variables over 0 and 1. All these definitions of Boolean algebra can be shown to be equivalent.|$|E

The order was appealed to the Second District Court of Appeals the following day, which resulted in an automatic stay under state law. While the stay was in effect, Florida Department of Law Enforcement personnel prepared to take custody of Terri and transfer her to a local hospital for reinsertion of the feeding tube. Once Greer was made aware of the stay, he ordered it lifted and all parties stood down. Governor Bush decided to obey the court order despite enormous pressure from the political right. If Bush (or the Florida Legislature) had ignored Greer's order by attempting to remove her from the hospice, a confrontation between the Pinellas Park Police Department and the FDLE agents could have ensued. In jest, one official said local police discussed [...] "...whether <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> officers to hold off the National Guard." ...|$|E

"We {{had more}} {{material}} than the required 40-odd minutes for one album. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> material for {{one and a}} half LPs, so we figured let's put out a double and use some of the material we had done previously but never released.

But on these most favourable terms we could only win through huge difficulties and incredibly great losses. In fact this victory was a moral defeat. Our people certainly never got knowledge of it because we never told them the truth." ...|$|E

2500|$|Saxe {{was blamed}} by the [...] "carpet generals" [...] for halting the pursuit 100 {{yards from the}} {{battlefield}} and not turning {{the defeat of the}} allies into a rout. But the enemy were not, even now, lacking in discipline or morale, and the allied cavalry were at last admirably handled. He later explained that while the allied cavalry were still relatively intact, his own had been decimated. Afterwards he gave his reason for not pursuing the allies further – [...] "As <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> of it, I thought only of restoring order of the troops engaged [...] in the charge.". As Louis XV rode over to congratulate his commander for avenging Poitiers, Saxe's personal guard helped their ailing Marshal onto his horse to meet and embrace his sovereign.|$|E
2500|$|After the Secret of the Runes tour, {{the band}} had amassed 55 {{unreleased}} songs {{which included the}} ones Johnsson had shelved as well as contributions from the Niemann brothers. Johnsson remarked that [...] "we went through the songs and realized that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> good material for three albums. Recording one after the other, promoting, and touring each one separately would have taken several years {{and would have been}} a bad idea; and being so productive, we would have had another 55 songs waiting when we finally came to the end of it." [...] In 2004, the band released 21 tracks on two albums: Lemuria and Sirius B. The albums were released simultaneously and were available as separate albums or a twin-pack. 171 musicians participated, including the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra and a 32-member choir. Contributing to lead vocals were Mats Levén and a returning Piotr Wawrzeniuk.|$|E
2500|$|The {{decision}} {{to set the}} game four thousand years before [...] {{was one of the}} first details about the game made known. LucasArts gave BioWare a choice of settings for the game. [...] "LucasArts came to us and said that we could do an [...] game," [...] BioWare CEO Raymond Muzyka said. [...] "Or LucasArts said we could go 4,000 years back, which is a period that's hardly been covered before." [...] BioWare chose to set the game four thousand years before the films as it gave them greater creative freedom. They aimed to create content similar to that from the films but different enough to be a definite precursor. Concept work had to be sent to [...] "the ranch" [...] to be approved for use. Muzyka noted that very little of their content was rejected: [...] "It was more like, 'Can you just make his head like this rather than like that.' So it was all very feasible. There were good suggestions made and they made the game better, so we were happy to do them. It was a good process really and I think we were pleasantly surprised how easy LucasArts was to work with." [...] Zeschuk said that [...] "Overall, we were really happy with the results. We felt like <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> freedom to truly create something wonderful." ...|$|E

2500|$|The band {{released}} several {{songs for}} War Child compilations. In 2002 Elbow recorded {{a cover of}} [...] "Something in the Air" [...] for the compilation 1 Love. Elbow contributed the song [...] "Snowball" [...] to another compilation, , in September 2005. The song was originally recorded for the Cast of Thousands record but omitted from the final album as the band felt it did not fit; the political lyrics suited the Warchild compilation. In 2009 Elbow contributed their cover of U2's [...] "Running to Stand Still" [...] to War Child Presents Heroes. Garvey explained: [...] "When the band first met each other aged 17, Mark and Craig's father Gareth would lend us his Volvo to get our gear around. It seemed that {{for a year and}} a half all that we listened to in that car was Rattle and Hum. I remember the excitement every time a U2 album was released, we just loved them. The first song we ever covered together before <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> of our own songs to do a performance was 'Running to Stand Still'. For 'Heroes' we've changed the order of things but kept every musical theme in the song. We wrote it with the members of U2 in mind. War Child do exactly what it says on the tin. These kids shouldn't be in such circumstances in the first place, but they are, so thank god someone's doing something about it".|$|E
