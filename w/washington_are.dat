25|$|East of the Cascades, {{in eastern}} Washington and eastern Oregon, the {{population}} is much more conservative. The eastern portions of Washington and especially Oregon, due to their low populations, do not generally have enough voting power to be competitive at the state level, and thus the governorships and U.S. Senate seats of both Oregon and <b>Washington</b> <b>are</b> usually held by the Democrats. Conservatism {{in the eastern part}} of the Pacific Northwest tends to be distrustful of federal government interference and strongly protective of gun rights.|$|E

25|$|The District {{is divided}} into four {{quadrants}} of unequal area: Northwest (NW), Northeast (NE), Southeast (SE), and Southwest (SW). The axes bounding the quadrants radiate from the U.S. Capitol building. All road names include the quadrant abbreviation to indicate their location, and house numbers are assigned based on the approximate number of blocks away from the Capitol. In most of the city, the streets are set out in a grid pattern with east–west streets named with letters (e.g., C Street SW) and north–south streets with numbers (e.g., 4th Street NW). Two avenues, Constitution Avenue and Independence Avenue, line {{each side of the}} Mall. Many of the diagonal streets and avenues in <b>Washington</b> <b>are</b> named after states. Some of these streets are particularly noteworthy, such as Pennsylvania Avenue, which connects the White House with the U.S. Capitol and Massachusetts Avenue, a section of which is informally known as Embassy Row given the number of foreign embassies located along the street.|$|E
25|$|Viticulture in Washington State {{is deeply}} {{influenced}} {{by the use of}} irrigation and the water rights associated with suitable vineyard land. Sourced from the major rivers that run through the area, most vineyards in Eastern <b>Washington</b> <b>are</b> irrigated though some vineyards (especially in the slightly wetter Walla Walla Valley near the Blue Mountains), but some have begun experimenting with dry farming. The ever-present threat of severe winter frost has influenced viticultural practices including the adoption of wind turbines to churn and circulate air in the vineyard. In the late 20th century, many producers began adapting Russian vine-training techniques for fan-training which promotes better air circulation among the vine so cold air doesn't settle on the vine. Due to the minimal risk exposure to phylloxera, some producers have opted to leave their vines ungrafted on its original rootstock since an exposed graft union is more vulnerable to frost damage. One benefit of the traditionally cold winters is that the grapevines are allowed to go into full dormancy, which allows the vines to shut down and conserve energy that will be vital {{at the beginning of the}} new growth cycle for the vine. The threat of freezing condition is the main viticultural hazard that vine growers need to concern themselves with since the lack of rainfall during the summer and autumn contribute to the dry, arid conditions that allows most of Washington vineyards to be relatively disease free.|$|E

500|$|The volcano {{is located}} in Washington, {{and is one of}} the five major stratovolcanoes there.
