The <b>wet</b> <b>milled</b> LiFePO 4 delivers 149 mAhg‒ 1 at 0. 1 C, which is compar-able to carbon coated LiFePO 4 and approximately 74 % higher than that of dry milled LiFePO 4, suggesting that the wet milling process can increase the capacity in addition to conventional carbon coating methods.

The exothermic peak was observed neither for the dry milled samples nor for the <b>wet</b> <b>milled</b> and subsequently annealed powders at 350 degrees C for 4 h.

The evolution of the particle size distribution versus the milling time has been determined for the wet mechanical milling process of nanocrystalline Ni 3 Fe powders.

40|$|Entrapment of starch {{granules}} within cassava parenchyma cells {{constitutes a}} major challenge in starch extraction from cassava tuber. This was addressed by applying cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic enzymes coupled with spontaneous lactic acid bacteria fermentation in the pre-treatment of <b>wet</b> <b>milled</b> cassava. The hydrolytic activities of the enzymes and pH lowering by the fermentation resulted in fragmentation of the cassava cell walls, with improved release of free starch granules.

40|$|Abstract Background Enzymatic corn <b>wet</b> <b>milling</b> (E-milling) is {{a process}} derived from {{conventional}} <b>wet</b> <b>milling</b> for the recovery and purification of starch and co-products using proteases to {{eliminate the need for}} sulfites and decrease the steeping time. In 2006, the total starch production in USA by conventional <b>wet</b> <b>milling</b> equaled 23 billion kilograms, including modified starches and starches used for sweeteners and ethanol production 1. Process engineering and cost models for an E-milling process have been developed for a processing plant with a capacity of 2. 54 million kg of corn per day (100, 000 bu/day). These models are based on the previously published models for a traditional <b>wet</b> <b>milling</b> plant with the same capacity. The E-milling process includes grain cleaning, pretreatment, enzymatic treatment, germ separation and recovery, fiber separation and recovery, gluten separation and recovery and starch separation. Information {{for the development of the}} conventional models was obtained from a variety of technical sources including commercial <b>wet</b> <b>milling</b> companies, industry experts and equipment suppliers. Additional information for the present models was obtained from our own experience with the development of the E-milling process and trials in the laboratory and at the pilot plant scale. The models were developed using process and cost simulation software (SuperPro Designer ®) and include processing information such as composition and flow rates of the various process streams, descriptions of the various unit operations and detailed breakdowns of the operating and capital cost of the facility. Results Based on the information from the model, we can estimate the cost of production per kilogram of starch using the input prices for corn, enzyme and other <b>wet</b> <b>milling</b> co-products. The work presented here describes the E-milling process and compares the process, the operation and costs with the conventional process. Conclusion The E-milling process was found to be cost competitive with the conventional process during periods of high corn feedstock costs since the enzymatic process enhances the yields of the products in a corn <b>wet</b> <b>milling</b> process.

The study consisted of a 5 -day pre-period and two sections of 28 days each. Each of those two sections was composed of an introductory 7 -day period and three periods of 7 days each. Five kinds of bread were fed. These included the following: (1) bread with no bran supplement; (2) bread with wet-milled, fine-ground corn bran; (3) bread with wet-milled, coarse-ground corn bran; (4) bread with dry-milled, fine-ground corn bran; and (5) bread with dry-milled, coarse-ground corn bran. Results indicated that fecal transit times were shorter, fecal wet weights were greater, and fecal percent moisture was greater, for subjects when fed the <b>wet</b> <b>milled</b> rather than the dry milled brans. Electron microscopy indicated that sharper margins of dry milled brans might cause intestinal mucosa wall damage. ^ In Study II comparative effects of feeding the same corn brans on histological changes of gastrointestinal tract of 60 weanling mice were measured.

The influence of milling time on the particle size, the crystallinity, the morphology and the dissolution rate of MEL has been studied in the presence and absence of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as a stabilizer agent. Micronized MEL particles were produced in aqueous medium which did not contain additive after milling for 10 min. For nanonization an additive and longer milling time were required.

The nanonized MEL crystals (D 50 = 126 nm) exhibited a regular shape and a smooth surface. The increased specific surface area resulted in a high dissolution rate and concentration of free MEL.

Calcined gel was milled either in ethanol or in ethanol {{with the addition of}} 0. 03 g of polyethyleneimine (PEI) per gram of mullite. DTA, TG and mass spectrometry revealed esterification of unhydrated surface of particles formed by milling in ethanol. The difference in the structural evolution of powders and their dependence on annealing temperature seen in 29 Si MAS NMR spectra and XRD patterns is attributed to different degrees of segregation of alumina and silica components, and to differing compositions of transitory spinel phase. In both samples the segregation of silica and alumina was observed at temperatures less than that for mullite crystallization. The degree of segregation was much smaller in the sample milled in ethanol. Therefore, in the latter sample spinel with larger silica content incorporated in γ-Al 2 O 3 will crystallize by annealing at 900 °C, and Al-rich mullite at 1100 °C. Due to greater segregation of silica and alumina component in the presence of PEI, the crystallization of spinel with smaller amounts of silica incorporated into γ-Al 2 O 3 is shifted to 1100 °C, and orthorhombic mullite to about 1200 °C.
