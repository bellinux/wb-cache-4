Clayton favored the extension of the charter for the Second Bank of the United States and his investigation of the Post Office Department led to its reorganization.

[...] Once on the ground he found a shaken army conducting a hesitant withdrawal, and in urgent need of delaying tactics to slow the German advance.

The plan, which involved Victor Jones creating a strong fictional force of 300 tanks on the British right hand flank, {{was in full swing}} during February. The operation appears to have had limited effect. Rommel delayed his advance until May, when British forces were routed at the Battle of Gazala and the Germans resumed their push toward Egypt.|$|E

The Director of Naval Gunnery was particularly pungent in his assessment of the design, [...] "The functions and requirements of carriers and of surface gun platforms are entirely incompatible ...the conceptions of these designs ...is evidently the result of an unresolved contest between a conscious acceptance of aircraft and a subconscious desire for a 1914 Fleet ...these abortions are the results of a psychological maladjustment.

Grimm, Wackernagel, Sinrock , and Wolf. On the other hand, Weinhold rejects the idea on philological grounds, and so do Heinrich Leo and Hermann Oesre.
