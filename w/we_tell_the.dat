25|$|After {{the death}} of her husband, Onassis {{returned}} permanently to the United States, splitting her time between Manhattan, Martha's Vineyard, and the Kennedy Compound in Hyannis, Massachusetts. In 1975, she became a consulting editor at Viking Press, a position that she held for two years. After almost a decade of avoiding participation in political events, she attended the 1976 Democratic National Convention and stunned the assembled delegates when she appeared in the visitors' gallery. She resigned from Viking Press in 1977 following the false accusation by The New York Times that she held some responsibility for the company's publication of Jeffrey Archer novel Shall <b>We</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>the</b> President?, which was set in a fictional future presidency of Ted Kennedy and described an assassination plot against him. Two years later, she appeared alongside her mother-in-law Rose Kennedy at Faneuil Hall in Boston when Ted Kennedy announced {{that he was going to}} challenge incumbent President Jimmy Carter for the Democratic nomination for president. She participated in the subsequent presidential campaign, which was unsuccessful.|$|E

2500|$|In the AAAS Science and Technology Policy Yearbook 2001 {{article titled}} A Response to Bill Joy and the Doom-and-Gloom Technofuturists, Bill Joy {{was criticized for}} having {{technological}} tunnel vision on his prediction, by failing to consider social factors. [...] In Ray Kurzweil's The Singularity Is Near, he questioned the regulation of potentially dangerous technology, asking [...] "Should <b>we</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> millions of people afflicted with cancer and other devastating conditions that we are canceling the development of all bioengineered treatments {{because there is a}} risk that these same technologies may someday be used for malevolent purposes?".|$|E
2500|$|The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades in the West Bank of the Palestinian territories, the {{military}} {{wing of the}} Fatah party, was reported by the Ma'an News Agency to have mourned bin Laden's death, declaring in a statement: [...] "The Islamic nation was shocked {{with the news that}} bin Laden had been killed by the non-believers. He left a generation who follows the education he gave in Jihad. The fighters in Palestine and around the world who have lost their leaders did not stop their mission and will continue in the tutelage of their masters. <b>We</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> Israeli and the American occupiers that we have leaders who have changed history with their Jihad and their steadfastness. We are ready to sacrifice our lives to bring back peace." [...] Ma'an later reported that the group's spokesman denied issuing the statement.|$|E
2500|$|As {{additional}} tests are discussed for {{addition to the}} panels, issues arise. [...] Many question if the expanded testing still falls under the requirements necessary to justify the {{additional tests}}. [...] Many of the new diseases being tested for are rare and have no known treatment, {{while some of the}} diseases need not be treated until later in life. [...] This raises more issues, such as: if there is no available treatment for the disease should we test for it at all? And if we do, what do <b>we</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> families of those with children bearing one of the untreatable diseases? Studies show that the more rare the disease is and the more diseases being tested for, the more likely the tests are to produce false-positives. This is an issue because the newborn period is a crucial time for the parents to bond with the child, and it has been noted that ten percent of parents whose children were diagnosed with a false-positive still worried that their child was fragile and/or sickly even though they were not, potentially preventing the parent-child bond forming as it would have otherwise. As a result, some parents may begin to opt out of having their newborns screened. Many parents are also concerned about what happens with their infant's blood samples after screening. The samples were originally taken to test for preventable diseases, but with the advance in genomic sequencing technologies many samples are being kept for DNA identification and research, increasing the possibility that more children will be opted out of newborn screening from parents who see the kept samples as a form of research done on their child.|$|E

Now Mrs. Larkyn was a frivolous woman, in whom none would have suspected deep hate. So Platte took no action, and came to believe gradually, from the Colonel's silence, that the Colonel must have [...] "run off the line" [...] somewhere that night, and, therefore, preferred to stand sentence on the lesser count of rambling into other people's compounds out of calling hours. Platte forgot about the watch business after a while, and moved down-country with his regiment. Mrs. Larkyn went home when her husband's tour of Indian service expired. She never forgot.|$|E

Now I think the great reason Jone's rumbling worked so well was that it had in it a sort of Great British chest-sound, as if his lungs was rusty. The waiter had heard that before and knew what it meant. If he had spoken out in the clear American fashion I expect his voice would have gone clear through the waiter without his knowing it, like the person in the story, whose neck was sliced through and who didn't know it until he sneezed and his head fell off.|$|E
