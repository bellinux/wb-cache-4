Looking forward, the question of a possible anchor for medium-term fiscal policy is <b>worth</b> <b>exploring.</b> Morocco's low social indicators and large infrastructure needs could justify an increase in social spending and public investment. Further, some nominal tax rates remain high by international standards, possibly warranting a lowering of some rates. At the same time, the relatively high level of public debt remains a constraining factor, particularly as heightened attractiveness to investors is a key component of Morocco's strategy of deepening its integration in the global economy.|$|E

40|$|House {{maintenance}} {{is crucial to}} ensure the longevity of house components, {{in the same time}} retaining their functionality. Unfortunately, house owners are usually caught off-guarded, especially when house components were already deteriorated without warning. Adding salt to the wound, major house maintenance and rectification generally occur after defect liability period in which the costs incurred are not covered by the developer. The pertaining issue of lack prevention measures towards house components at certain point of time is prevalent. Since there is no established pre-rectification guideline that is able to assist house owners to proactively self-evaluate their house components from time to time, the said problem stays firm. Here, as far as maintenance’s guideline is concerned, knowledge gap in terms of life expectancy (LE) of generic house components is well observed. Therefore, the authors embarked on research exploration through literatures on identifying the factors leading to LE for house components and further suggested average LE for generic house components. However, the authors limit the paper within the initial process of research exploration to understand the central phenomenon of this study, which only governed the process of reviewing literatures. In a nutshell, the authors posit that LE was <b>worth</b> <b>explored</b> by embedding a multi-layered thematic analysis which comprised of several interconnected themes between house components and life expectancy of house component.
