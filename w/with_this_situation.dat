Campbell had originally planned to establish a college for the blind in the United States, but was persuaded by Armitage that London {{would be a more}} suitable location. At the time, English schools for the blind did not provide their students with the skills to become independent and, dissatisfied <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>situation,</b> Armitage dreamed of establishing a school whose emphasis was on music and which would prepare its students for careers as organists, piano tuners, and music teachers.|$|E

25|$|The {{reinstatement}} of Pakubuwana II in Kartasura on 14 December 1742 {{marked the}} end of the Chinese war. It showed who was in control of the situation. Accordingly, Sunan Kuning surrendered in October 1743, followed by other rebel leaders. In the mid-18th century, Mataram lost much of their lands, by 1743 Mataram only consists of areas around Surakarta, Yogyakarta, Kedu and Bagelen. Cakraningrat IV was definitely not pleased <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>situation</b> and he began to make alliance with Surabaya, the descendants of Untung Surapati, and hired more Balinese mercenaries. He stopped paying tribute to VOC in 1744, and after a failed attempt to negotiate, the Dutch attacked Madura in 1745 and ousted Cakraningrat, who was banished to the Cape in 1746.|$|E
25|$|Hoffa began union {{organizational}} work at {{the grassroots}} level through his employment as a teenager with a grocery chain, a job which paid substandard wages and offered poor working conditions with minimal job security. The workers were displeased <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>situation</b> and tried to organize a union to better their lot. Although Hoffa was young, his bravery and approachability in this role impressed fellow workers, and he rose to a leadership position. By 1932, after defiantly refusing to work for an abusive shift foreman, who inspired Hoffa's long career of organizing workers, he left the grocery chain, in part because of his union activities, and Hoffa was then invited to become an organizer with the Local 299 of the Teamsters in Detroit.|$|E

The album reached No. 119 on the Billboard charts in early August with a stay of five weeks on the Billboard 200.

25|$|Enraged <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>situation</b> and {{determined}} to establish their authority, the company requested King James II in 1685 to {{permit the use of}} force against the Emperor’s army to settle the matter. Admiral Nicholson was sent with ships to attack the port at Chittagong, fortify it, make an alliance with the King of Arakan who was against the Mughals, establish a mint and collect revenue, thus making Chittagong a fort city for the British in the eastern part. Then he was ordered to proceed to Dhaka. It was assumed that the Governor would abandon the city and then a peace treaty would be offered which would guarantee free trade and other economic benefits for the British and he would give up the territory of Dhaka and Chittagong. Job Charnock was then at Madras and was directed to join the expedition with 400 soldiers from the Madras division.|$|E
25|$|In April 1913 Montenegro {{seized control}} of Scutari in {{the latest round of}} {{hostilities}} between the Ottoman Empire and Montenegro during the closing stages of the First Balkan War. The view taken at the London Conference was that Scutari should be handed over to Albania. In April 1913 Burney was sent as temporary Second-in-Command of the Mediterranean Fleet, flying his flag in the cruiser HMS Dublin, to Antivari on the coast of Montenegro to take command of the international naval force despatched to deal <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>situation.</b> On arrival he blockaded Antivari and then, from May to November 1913, also commanded the international force occupying Scutari as part of its transition to Albanian control.

25|$|Nociceptor neuron {{sensitivity}} is modulated {{by a large}} {{variety of}} mediators in the extracellular space. Peripheral sensitization represents a form of functional plasticity of the nociceptor. The nociceptor can change from being simply a noxious stimulus detector to a detector of non-noxious stimuli. The result is that low intensity stimuli from regular activity, initiates a painful sensation. This {{is commonly known as}} hyperalgesia. Inflammation is one common cause that results in the sensitization of nociceptors. Normally hyperalgesia ceases when inflammation goes down, however, sometimes genetic defects and/or repeated injury can result in allodynia: a completely non-noxious stimulus like light touch causes extreme pain. Allodynia can also be caused when a nociceptor is damaged in the peripheral nerves. This can result in deafferentation, which means the development of different central processes from the surviving afferent nerve. <b>With</b> <b>this</b> <b>situation,</b> surviving dorsal root axons of the nociceptors can make contact with the spinal cord, thus changing the normal input.|$|E

It is possible that Vane encouraged Wheelwright to publish his Apology. After the death of Cromwell in 1658, events became less favorable for England's Puritans. When the monarchy returned to power under King Charles II in 1660, Vane was imprisoned for his role during England's Interregnum and then executed in June 1662. <b>With</b> <b>this</b> <b>situation,</b> Wheelwright returned to New England in the summer of 1662 with several other ministers who had been visiting the kingdom.|$|E
500|$|However, Nurkse {{clarified}} {{that the}} finance for this development must arise to as large an extent {{as possible from}} the underdeveloped country itself i.e. domestically.

In reality, the so-called [...] "new countries" [...] of the United States of America (which separated from the British empire) were high income countries to begin with. They were already endowed with efficient producers, effective markets and a high purchasing power.

The labour force had merely migrated from Britain to USA, and thus their level of skills were advanced to begin <b>with.</b> <b>This</b> <b>situation</b> of outward led growth was therefore unique and not replicable by underdeveloped countries.|$|E

[...] The league had become a rival to the already established Pacific Coast League (PCL), who, after being an [...] "outlaw" [...] league themselves, had signed the National Agreement with organized baseball, agreeing {{that they would not}} harbor blacklisted or banned players from the Major Leagues. A national commission decided {{that the best way to}} deal <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>situation</b> was to dissolve this outlaw league. [...] They did this by lifting the blacklist on any player already in the State League, which would create competition among all known leagues, for these players.
