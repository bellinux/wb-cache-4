This {{provides}} that anyone who attempts to commit an offence <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>punished</b> with {{the same period in}} prison as if they had succeeded; since theft carries a maximum penalty of seven years in prison, for example, someone convicted of attempted theft would also find themselves sentenced to a maximum of seven years.|$|E

You can see that a drunkard is killing himself, body and mind, by drink. You see that he knows that, poor wretch, as well as you. He knows that every time he gets drunk he is cutting so much off his life; and yet he cannot help it. He knows that drink is poison, and yet he goes back to his poison.|$|R

25|$|A {{number of}} schools once had a Raucherecke (smokers' corner), a small area of the schoolyard where {{students}} {{over the age of}} eighteen are permitted to smoke in their breaks.

Schools in these states prohibit smoking for students and teachers and offences at school <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>punished.</b> Other states in Germany are planning to introduce similar laws.|$|E
25|$|Naigu, excited but nervous, sets {{about his}} weekly routines. He is surprised, however, {{to find the}} people he {{encounters}} laughing at him far more openly than they had before. Naigu becomes bitter and harsh, {{to the point where}} one disciple proclaims: “Naigu <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>punished</b> for treating us so harshly instead of teaching us Buddha’s Law”. People continue to laugh at Naigu for his vanity, until one day, Naigu wakes up, and to his relief and rejoicing, his nose has returned to its original length.|$|E

25|$|The {{prisoners are}} {{assigned}} numbers for easy identification {{and in an}} effort to dehumanize them; Ivan Denisovich's prisoner number is Щ-854. Each day, the squad leader receives their work assignment for that day, and the squad are then fed according to how they perform. Prisoners in each squad are thus forced to work together and pressure each other to get their task done. If any prisoner is slacking, the whole squad <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>punished.</b> Despite this, Solzhenitsyn shows that a surprising loyalty exists among the work gang members, with Shukhov teaming up with other prisoners to steal felt and extra bowls of porridge; even the squad leader defies the authorities by tar-papering over the empty windows at their work site. Indeed, only through such solidarity can the prisoners do anything more than survive from day to day.|$|E
25|$|The sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, meanwhile, are {{behaving}} wickedly, {{for example}} by taking for themselves all the prime {{cuts of meat}} from sacrifices, and by committing adultery with the women who serve at the sanctuary entrance. Eli is aware of their behavior but he rebukes them too lightly and ultimately does not stop them. The sons continue in their sinful behavior, and so, according to the text, a man of God prophesies to Eli that Eli and his family <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>punished</b> for this, with all male descendants dying before reaching old age and being placed in positions subservient to prophets from other lineages. The curse alludes to a previous (not appearing elsewhere in the Bible) promise from God of Eli's lineage continuing eternally (c.f. similar promises to King David and Jehonadab). While this continuation is not revoked, a curse is placed on all of Eli's male descendants forever. As {{a sign of the}} accuracy of this future, Eli is told by the man of God that his sons will die on the same day.|$|E

Specifically, the Espionage Act of 1917 states that if anyone allows any enemies to enter or fly over the United States and obtain information from a place connected with the national defense, they <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>punished.</b> Hundreds of prosecutions followed.
