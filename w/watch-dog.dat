500|$|One of {{the main}} {{purposes}} {{for the creation of}} a UNPA is enhancing UN accountability and legitimacy. The United Nations System spent more than $1.8 billion of public money in 2005 and its own auditors have pointed out that it lacks adequate internal controls to protect against waste, fraud and mismanagement. By holding hearings, issuing reports, and passing resolutions, the UNPA could exercise oversight over other UN bodies. In a September 2007 press release, MEP Graham Watson expressed his hope that [...] "in an era where the UN's mandate has grown exponentially the UNPA would act as a <b>watch-dog</b> on its activities, monitoring its decision-making deadlines, its accountability and transparency". London Mayor Ken Livingstone promised that, [...] "a more democratic United Nations as envisaged by this campaign will strengthen the accountability and legitimacy of the UN." [...] The Pan African Parliament's resolution mirrored this sentiment: [...] "If democratization is a major means to legitimize and improve national governance, it is also the most reliable way to legitimize and improve international organization, making it more open and responsive by increasing participation." ...|$|E

2500|$|Of {{the other}} two plays {{that made up the}} trilogy that {{included}} Seven Against Thebes, Laius and Oedipus, and of its satyr play The Sphinx, few fragments have survived. [...] The only fragment definitively assigned to Oedipus is a line translated by Herbert Weir Smyth as [...] "We were coming on our journey to the place from which three highways part in the branching roads, where we crossed the junction of the triple roads at Potniae." [...] The only two fragments definitively assigned to The Sphinx were translated by Smyth as [...] "For the stranger a garland, an ancient crown, the best of bonds, as Prometheus said," [...] and [...] "The Sphinx, the <b>Watch-dog</b> that presideth over evil days." ...|$|E

6000|$|Then {{the witch}} was furious with the <b>watch-dog</b> {{and with the}} birch-trees, because they had let the {{children}} pass. But the dog answered: ...|$|E

'No. If you dare {{to come here}} again unless you're sent for, I'll keep <b>watch-dogs</b> in the yard that'll growl and bite--I'll have man-traps, cunningly altered and {{improved}} for catching women--I'll have spring guns, that shall explode when you tread upon the wires, and blow you into little pieces.

50|$|The Camel Club is a {{group of}} fictional {{characters}} created by American novelist David Baldacci. They are the protagonists of five of his novels: The Camel Club, The Collectors, Stone Cold, Divine Justice, and Hell's Corner.

6000|$|We {{left the}} Old Town on our right hand, and drove on, past a little colony of {{suburban}} villas, {{to a house}} standing by itself, surrounded by a stone wall. As we crossed the front garden {{on our way to}} the door, I noticed against the side of the house two kennels, inhabited by two large <b>watch-dogs.</b> Was the proprietor afraid of thieves? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, the <b>Watch-Dog</b> cannot {{keep people}} out," [...] said Dot. [...] "He's too polite and good-natured. When {{we said we}} would not mind him he was sorry, but he didn't try to stop us." ...|$|E

60|$|The small {{rain fell}} too softly {{to be heard}} in the garden; not a leaf stirred in the airless calm; the <b>watch-dog</b> was asleep, the cats were indoors; far or near, under the murky heaven, not a sound was stirring.|$|E

60|$|Blakeney made up {{his mind}} to keep this house in sight. This art of {{watching}} he had acquired to a masterly extent, and could have taught Heron's <b>watch-dogs</b> a remarkable lesson in it. At night, of course, it was a comparatively easy task. There were a good many unlighted doorways along the quay, whilst a street lamp was fixed on a bracket in the wall of the very house which he kept in observation.|$|R

60|$|Babie did {{not like}} it, but she well knew {{that she should be}} contemptuously put down if she {{attempted}} an inquiry, far less a remonstrance, with Janet. Only, with a puzzled sort of <b>watch-dog</b> sense, she sat up in bed and stared.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't say exactly," [...] he replied, thoughtfully. [...] "In general I {{would bring}} to bear as many senses as possible. I would see, I would hear, I would touch. I would make {{electricity}} my <b>watch-dog.</b> I would make matter my trap." ...|$|E

60|$|THE {{two boys}} flew on and on, toward the village, {{speechless}} with horror. They glanced backward {{over their shoulders}} from time to time, apprehensively, as if they feared they might be followed. Every stump that started up in their path seemed a man and an enemy, and made them catch their breath; and as they sped by some outlying cottages that lay near the village, the barking of the aroused <b>watch-dogs</b> seemed to give wings to their feet.|$|R

50|$|The {{film was}} shot in Temecula, California and {{produced}} by Lonesome Pictures. Prior {{to the production of}} the film, there was an extensive search for Edwin. Although his residence had been confirmed, there were different variables that stood in the way of actual contact. At the time, Borsheim had no phone or email and his property was guarded by his <b>watch-dogs</b> which made it virtually impossible to come in contact with him. After resigning the idea of making the film, Borsheim's relatives activated a phone for him and put the filmmakers in contact. The film began production months after they started their search.|$|R
