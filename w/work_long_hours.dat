5|$|Industrial {{conscription}} and {{the drive}} to increase productivity led to an increasing degree of industrial unrest over time. Many workers were required to <b>work</b> <b>long</b> <b>hours</b> in poor conditions and {{were not able to}} change their employment due to the manpower laws. Poor work conditions were exacerbated by the Government's austerity measures reducing workers' standards of living. As a result, strikes and other forms of protest disrupted Australian production, especially from 1943 onwards. These protests attracted considerable criticism from other civilians and members of the military. In May 1943 the Government introduced policies which enabled workers who were undertaking unlawful industrial action to be conscripted into the military, but this had little impact due to the shortage of skilled labour in the industries most prone to industrial disputes.|$|E
5|$|Treloar {{returned}} to the AWM on 2September 1946 and was formally discharged from the Army in 1947. At the time he believed {{he was suffering from}} bad health, but wanted to resume his work at the Memorial rather than enter hospital. While Clarissa Treloar remained in Melbourne, their daughter Dawn moved to Canberra and took up a position in the Memorial's library. Treloar continued to <b>work</b> <b>long</b> <b>hours</b> in the years after the war. He lived in a cubby hole next to his office and signed the attendance book while walking from bed to his desk. Bean later claimed that Treloar had personally managed all areas of the Memorial other than its library. While Dawn provided him with company, family members and AWM staff believed that Treloar was lonely and did not have a social life. His letters to the official artists engaged by the AWM were frequently relaxed, however, and he became friends with Leslie Bowles and William Dargie. While Treloar was a teetotaler and non-smoker, he occasionally shared wine and cigarettes with Dargie.|$|E
5|$|Jim's plan {{to drive}} home from Philadelphia to see his {{daughter}} CeCe's ballet recital hits a snag when a major investor says he is backing out. Jim asks his wife Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) to record the recital with her phone, which she agrees to do. During {{the opening of the}} recital, she stops recording to take a phone call informing her that she has been chosen to paint an important public mural. In her excitement, she messes up the recording and fails to record any of CeCe's appearance. Jim calls her that evening to tell her the investor backed out, and his group will have to <b>work</b> <b>long</b> <b>hours</b> to make up the lost funds. He asks her to send him her recording of the recital as a way to cheer him up, and Pam confesses that she did not tape it. She tries to make light of the mishap by making self-deprecating remarks and pointing out that they can get recordings of the recital from other attendees, but he becomes frustrated at her, scolding her and starting a fight over his new job, the time he spends away from the family, and the sacrifices they are making to get their new life to work. After he hangs up, Pam breaks down in tears. A previously unseen boom operator named Brian (Chris Diamantopoulos) enters into the shot and comforts her, and tells the crew to stop filming.|$|E

25|$|After Rinehart {{returned}} in 1919, Hopwood joined her in Sewickley, Pennsylvania (where she lived); {{they worked on}} the play there and in New York City until they completed it. While they worked on The Bat, Wagenhals and Kemper asked them {{to work on a}} script for Spanish Love (an adaptation of María del Carmen, an 1896 Spanish play). Writing both plays required Rinehart and Hopwood to <b>work</b> <b>long</b> <b>hours.</b> By early April 1920, they were working on a final, more-humorous round of revisions for The Bat.|$|E

25|$|Forced or unfair {{labor in}} textile {{production}} {{is not limited}} to developing countries. Charges of use of sweatshop labor are endemic in the United States. Immigrant women <b>work</b> <b>long</b> <b>hours</b> and receive less than minimum wage. In the United States, there is more of a stigma against child labor than forced labor in general. Consumers in the United States are willing to suspend the importation of textiles made with child labor in other countries but do not expect their exports to be suspended by other countries, even when produced using forced labor.|$|E
25|$|Ro Leap was Ung's {{home for}} the next {{eighteen}} months. Cut off from all outside communication and constantly in fear of soldiers who patrolled the village, the Ungs were forced by the Khmer Rouge to <b>work</b> <b>long</b> <b>hours</b> with very little food. Near-starvation and physical exhaustion became a way of life. A few months after their arrival, Loung's oldest brothers, eighteen-year-old Meng and sixteen-year-old Khouy, and her oldest sister, fourteen-year-old Keav, were sent away to work in different camps. Six months later, in August 1976, Keav died of food poisoning at the teenagers’ work camp at Kong Cha Lat. In December, two soldiers came to the Ungs' hut and demanded the help of Loung's father to free a stuck wagon; he was never seen or heard from again.|$|E
25|$|Paul Erdős {{was born}} in Budapest, Austria-Hungary, on 26 March 1913. He was the only {{surviving}} child of Anna and Lajos Erdős (formerly Engländer). His two sisters, aged 3 and 5, both died of scarlet fever {{a few days before}} he was born. His parents were both Jewish mathematics teachers. His fascination with mathematics developed early—he was often left home by himself because his father had been imprisoned in a Siberian gulag, causing his mother to have to <b>work</b> <b>long</b> <b>hours</b> to support their household. He taught himself to read through mathematics texts that his parents left around their home. By the age of four, given a person’s age, he could calculate in his head, how many seconds they had lived. Due to his sisters' deaths, he had a close relationship with his mother, with the two of them allegedly sharing the same bed until he left for college.|$|E

25|$|Japan's society prepares {{its people}} to work {{primarily}} {{for the good of}} the whole society rather than just the individual, and the salaryman is a part of that. Salarymen are expected to <b>work</b> <b>long</b> <b>hours,</b> additional overtime, to participate in after-work leisure activities such as drinking and visiting hostess bars with colleagues, and to value work over all else. The salaryman typically enters a company after graduating college and stays with that corporation his whole career. Other popular notions surrounding salarymen include karōshi, or death from overwork. In conservative Japanese culture, becoming a salaryman is the expected career choice for young men and those who do not take this career path are regarded as living with a stigma and less prestige. On the other hand, the word salaryman is sometimes used with derogatory connotation for his total dependence on his employer and lack of individuality.|$|E
25|$|Western riding is a {{style of}} horseback riding which evolved from the {{ranching}} and warfare traditions brought to the Americas by the Spanish Conquistadors, and both equipment and riding style evolved to meet the working needs of the cowboy in the American West. American cowboys needed to <b>work</b> <b>long</b> <b>hours</b> in the saddle over rough terrain, sometimes needing to rope cattle with a lariat (or lasso). Because of the necessity to control the horse {{with one hand and}} use a lariat with the other, western horses were trained to neck rein, that is, to change direction with light pressure of a rein against the horse's neck. Horses were also trained to exercise a certain degree of independence in using their natural instincts to follow the movements of a cow, thus a riding style developed that emphasized a deep, secure seat, and training methods encouraged a horse to be responsive on very light rein contact.|$|E
25|$|Despite this talent, Berlioz {{never held}} an {{employed}} position of conductor during his lifetime, {{forced to be}} content with only guest conducting. This was almost not the case. In late 1835, he was approached by the management of a new concert hall in Paris, the Gymnase Musical, and offered a position as their musical director. To Berlioz this was an ideal opportunity. Not only would it give him a large annual salary (between 6000 and 12,000 francs), {{but it would also}} give him a platform from which to perform his own music, and the music of fellow progressives. Berlioz accepted the offer, and signed the contract for the position. However, a new decree issued by the revolutionary government forced him to change his mind. The obstacle was one of the many restrictions that the revolutionary government had placed on the running of musical establishments, forbidding the performance of vocal music, so they did not compete with the influential Paris Opéra (among other organisations). There were passionate arguments and attempts to circumvent this restriction, but they fell on deaf ears, and the Gymnase Musical became a dance hall instead. This left Berlioz dejected, and would prove to have been a crucial cross-roads in his life, forcing him to <b>work</b> <b>long</b> <b>hours</b> as a critic, which severely impaired his free time available for composition.|$|E

500|$|As Quartermaster General, Cannan was {{responsible}} for the Australian Army's supply, transport and engineering services throughout Australia and the South West Pacific Area. It was the most important logistical command in Australian history. In carrying it out, he clashed repeatedly with the Department of Defence Coordination in its attempt to maintain peacetime financial controls.

500|$|Despite the Mayo Foundation's {{arguments}} otherwise, the Court {{ruled that}} [...] "student" [...] was a sufficiently ambiguous term {{to state that}} Congress has specifically addressed the issue. The Court also noted that Congress in the past had specifically singled out medical residents when making exemptions available, which in the Court's eyes made the Mayo Foundation's arguments about unambiguity unreasonable. Therefore, according to Chevron, {{the role of the}} courts should solely be to determine whether the Treasury Department made a reasonable decision—and the Court concluded that the Treasury did just that. In writing for the Court, Roberts stated that [...] "The [...] department certainly did not act irrationally in concluding that these doctors – 'who <b>work</b> <b>long</b> <b>hours,</b> serve as high [...] skilled professionals, and typically share {{some or all of the}} terms of employment of career employees' – are the kind of workers that Congress intended to both contribute and benefit from the Social Security system".|$|E
500|$|Rand's {{first major}} {{success as a}} writer came in 1943 with The Fountainhead, a romantic and {{philosophical}} novel that she wrote {{over a period of}} seven years. The novel centers on an uncompromising young architect named Howard Roark and his struggle against what Rand described as [...] "second-handers"—those who attempt to live through others, placing others above themselves. It was rejected by twelve publishers before finally being accepted by the Bobbs-Merrill Company on the insistence of editor Archibald Ogden, who threatened to quit if his employer did not publish it. While completing the novel, Rand was prescribed the amphetamine Benzedrine to fight fatigue. The drug helped her to <b>work</b> <b>long</b> <b>hours</b> to meet her deadline for delivering the novel, but afterwards she was so exhausted that her doctor ordered two weeks' rest. Her use of the drug for approximately three decades may have contributed to what some of her later associates described as volatile mood swings.|$|E
