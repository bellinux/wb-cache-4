Later, {{he would work}} the fields of his lands alongside his father and occasionally traveled with him from place to place, selling their agricultural products. During World War I (1914–18) he was conscripted into the Ottoman army (a requirement for male Ottoman citizens), posted outside of Palestine in Tripoli and Beirut. He returned following the Ottomans' defeat by British forces and their Hashemite Arab allies. His father had died sometime during the war. In 1920 Britain, which had already been {{in control of the}} area, established a mandate over Palestine {{under the auspices of the}} League of Nations.|$|E
5|$|From 1905–1907, Peng <b>was</b> <b>enrolled</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{traditional}} Confucian primary school. In 1908 Peng {{attended a}} modern primary school; but, {{at the age}} of ten, was forced to withdraw from this school due to his family's deteriorating financial situation. In 1905–1906, there was a severe drought in Hunan. Peng's mother died in 1905, and Peng's six-month-old brother died of hunger. Peng's father was forced to sell most of his family possessions for food, and to pawn most of his family's land. When Peng was withdrawn from school in 1908, he and his brothers were sent to beg for food in their village. From 1908–1910, Peng took a job looking after a pair of water buffaloes.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century the colony's ethnic Chinese {{population}} was severely undereducated, unable to enter schools for either Europeans or natives. Aged ten, Lie <b>was</b> <b>enrolled</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Calvinist missionary school run by Christiaan Albers. This school had roughly 60male students, mostly Chinese. Under Albers, a fluent speaker of Sundanese, he received his formal education in a curriculum which included the sciences, language, and Christianity– the schools were meant to promote Christianity in the Dutch East Indies, and students were required to pray before class. Lie, as with most students, did not convert, although biographer Tio Ie Soei writes that an understanding of Christianity likely affected his world view.|$|E

5|$|Despite being right-handed, Ganguly learnt to bat left-handed so {{he could}} use his brother's {{sporting}} equipment. After he showed some promise as a batsman, he <b>was</b> <b>enrolled</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cricket academy. An indoor multi-gym and concrete wicket was built at their home, so he and Snehasish could practice the game. They used to watch a number of old cricket match videos, especially the games played by David Gower, whom Ganguly admired. After he scored a century against the Orissa Under–15 side, he was made captain of St Xavier's School's cricket team, where several of his teammates complained against what they perceived to be his arrogance. While touring with a junior team, Ganguly refused his turn as the twelfth man, as he reportedly felt that the duties involved, which included organising equipment and drinks for the players, and delivering messages, were beneath his social status. Ganguly purportedly refused to do such tasks as he considered it beneath his social status to assist his teammates in such a way. However, his playmanship gave {{him a chance to}} make his first-class cricket debut for Bengal in 1989, the same year that his brother was dropped from the team.|$|E

Mary's maternal aunt, Sarah Latham Webster, was a Catholic, which may have influenced where she was sent to school.

She stayed at the Academy for Young Ladies for four years, leaving in 1839, when the school closed. She remained an observant Catholic {{for the rest of her}} life.|$|E
25|$|When Trotsky was eight, {{his father}} {{sent him to}} Odessa to be educated in a Jewish school. He <b>was</b> <b>enrolled</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> German-language school, which became Russified during his years in Odessa {{as a result of}} the Imperial government's policy of Russification. As Isaac Deutscher notes in his {{biography}} of Trotsky, Odessa was then a bustling cosmopolitan port city, very unlike the typical Russian city of the time. This environment contributed to the development of the young man's international outlook. Although Trotsky said in his autobiography My Life that he was never perfectly fluent in any language but Russian and Ukrainian, Raymond Molinier wrote that Trotsky spoke French fluently.|$|E

500|$|Benedict Arnold's {{father was}} a {{successful}} businessman, and the family moved in the upper levels of Norwich society. When he was ten, Arnold <b>was</b> <b>enrolled</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> private school in nearby Canterbury, {{with the expectation that}} he would eventually attend Yale. However, the deaths of his siblings two years later may have contributed to a decline in the family fortunes, since his father took up drinking. By the time that he was fourteen, there was no money for private education. His father's alcoholism and ill health kept him from training Arnold in the family mercantile business, but his mother's family connections secured an apprenticeship for him with her cousins Daniel and Joshua Lathrop, who operated a successful apothecary and general merchandise trade in Norwich.

500|$|Augustus Jones {{had learned}} of the band's {{troubles}} and ventured into the interior to bring Peter and John {{to live with him}} at his farm in Saltfleet Township, with their stepmother and halfsiblings. [...] As he knew only a few words of English, Peter <b>was</b> <b>enrolled</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> one-room school in Stoney Creek. With the help of the local teacher, George Hughes, Peter learned English. The next year, the family moved to Brantford, where Augustus took Peter out of school and began to instruct him in farming. [...] Sarah Tekarihogan's Iroquois tribe had settled in the Grand River valley in and around Brantford. [...] Here Jones was inducted into the Iroquois tribe and given the Mohawk name [...] "Desagondensta", meaning [...] "he stands people on their feet". [...] Jones was baptised Anglican by Reverend Ralph Leeming at the request of his father in 1820, but internally he did not accept Christianity. [...] Jones would later say that although the instruction he received in Christianity from his father, his stepmother and his old schoolteacher George Hughes had attracted him to the religion, the conduct of the white Christian settlers [...] "drunk, quarreling, fighting and cheating the poor Indians, and acting as if there was no God" [...] convinced him there could be no truth in their religion. [...] He allowed himself to be baptised primarily to become a full member of the white society of Upper Canada, with all the privileges it entailed. [...] Given the behaviour of others who had been baptised, Jones expected it to have no effect upon him. [...] Jones worked with his father farming until the summer of 1822, when he found employment as a brickmaker working for his brother-in-law Archibald Russell to raise money so he might resume his schooling. [...] He attended school in Fairchild's Creek during the winter of 18223 studying arithmetic and writing, hoping to obtain work as a clerk in the fur trade. [...] In spring 1823, Jones left the school, returning to his father's farm that May.|$|E
