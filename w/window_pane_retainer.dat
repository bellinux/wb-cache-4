40|$|Today <b>window</b> <b>panes</b> {{are usually}} coated {{with at least}} one metal or metal oxide layer to prevent heat energy of the light {{spectrum}} from propagating to the other side. This has given problems regarding radio propagation through windows, which might be utilized {{as a part of a}} buildings IEMI protection. This paper reports the results from measurements of the shielding effectiveness of a selection of modern <b>window</b> <b>panes</b> before and after irradiation with high power electromagnetic waves. The shielding effectiveness measurements are made in a nested reverberation chamber covering the range 1 – 18 GHz; both before and after high power irradiation at 1. 3 GHz. The results show that the shielding effectiveness of <b>window</b> <b>panes</b> may be severely impaired due to thermal stress effects on the coatings during the irradiation, depending of the type of coating.

40|$|Indoor {{building}} materials and inventory, e. g. wood panelling, furnitures, books and paintings, {{are subject to}} degradation from solar radiation through <b>window</b> <b>panes</b> and other glass structures. Especially ultraviolet light and short-wave visible light are liable for this material degradation. Hence, {{it is important to}} select <b>window</b> <b>panes</b> and glass structures which give adequate protection towards the incoming sun rays. In order to measure and calculate the capability of glass to protect indoor materials from degradation caused by the solar radiation, the quantity Solar Material Protection Factor (SMPF) is introduced. Comparison of the SMPF values for different glass fabrications, e. g. with various applied coatings, enables one to select the most appropriate glass materials for the specific buildings. Numerical examples are shown with measurements and calculations carried out on various glass materials, including an electrochromic window (ECW) device, and several two-layer and three-layer <b>window</b> <b>pane</b> combinations. In addition, as to be transparent is the primary function of windows, visibility levels at various protection degrees are also given...|$|R

2500|$|Mass {{production}} of glass <b>window</b> <b>panes</b> {{in the early}} twentieth century caused a similar effect. In glass factories, molten glass was poured onto a large cooling table and allowed to spread. The resulting glass is thicker at the location of the pour, located at the center of the large sheet. These sheets were cut into smaller <b>window</b> <b>panes</b> with nonuniform thickness, typically with the location of the pour centered in one of the panes (known as [...] "bull's-eyes") for decorative effect. Modern glass intended for windows is produced as float glass and is very uniform in thickness.|$|R
