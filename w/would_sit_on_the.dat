25|$|The {{destruction}} of Hatshepsut's images began during the co-regency of Amenhotep {{when his father}} was very old, but stopped during his reign. However, the king may have harboured his father's concern that another woman <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> throne. Despite his efforts however it is possible that a female co-regent of Akhenaten ruled as pharaoh before the end of his own 18th dynasty. His cause of death is unknown.|$|E

While recording the album Emerick <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stairs outside the studio {{so that he could}} [...] "listen to the mix properly". Emerick employed the use of instruments such as sitars and tabla as well as backwards guitar loops. The album contained many of Sergeant's favoured psychedelic influences.|$|E

500|$|During Victoria's {{lifetime}} and {{after her death}} in 1901, there have been rumours that Conroy or someone else, and not the Duke of Kent, was her biological father. Historians have continued to debate the accuracy and validity of these claims. In his 2003 work The Victorians, biographer A. N. Wilson suggests that Victoria was not actually descended from George III because several of her descendants had haemophilia, which was unknown among her recognised ancestors. Haemophilia is a genetic disease that [...] impairs the body's ability to control blood clotting, {{which is used to}} stop bleeding when a blood vessel is broken; it is carried in the female line but the symptoms manifest mostly in males. Wilson proposes that the Duchess of Kent took a lover (not necessarily Conroy) to ensure that a Coburg <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> British throne.|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} filmed during September 9–11, 1994 at the Lenox Lounge and on {{location}} on Lenox Avenue in Harlem. McDaniel {{and her team}} scouted out low-rent, speak-easy locations and they did street-casting, assembling off-beat characters, from transvestites to card tricksters and edgy Harlem teenagers. However, {{when it came to}} filming there was a problem—McDaniel's approach was to start the camera and let the cast improvise, but Madonna wanted direction. She <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> chair and when McDaniel said [...] "Action", she would still sit there saying impatiently, [...] "What am I doing? What am I doing? Hello?" [...] The director was overawed by Madonna's big entourage and had held herself from speaking her mind about the singer's look. She later asked Madonna to appear edgy like Jennifer Jason Leigh's character in the 1990 drama film Last Exit to Brooklyn. Madonna had her hair and makeup re-done and it was the final look for the video.|$|E

2500|$|In 2004, Washington Post writer John Kelly {{argued that}} the name was most {{directly}} linked to the [...] "Water Steps" [...] or [...] "Water Gate," [...] a set of ceremonial stairs west of the Lincoln Memorial that led down to the Potomac. The steps had been originally planned as a ceremonial gateway {{to the city and}} an official reception area for dignitaries arriving in Washington, D.C., via water taxi from Virginia, though they never served this function. Instead, beginning in 1935, the steps faced a floating performance stage on the Potomac River on which open-air concerts were held. Up to 12,000 people <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> steps and surrounding grass and listen to symphonies, military bands, and operas. The music venue was depicted in scenes in the motion pictures Houseboat [...] and Born Yesterday (1950). The barge concerts ended in 1965 when jet airliner service began at National Airport and the noise impaired the venue's viability.|$|E
2500|$|While {{living in}} San Francisco, Loos {{followed}} her dissolute alcoholic father as they explored the city's underbelly. Together they <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pier, fishing and making {{friends with the}} locals, feeding into Loos' lifelong fascination with lowlifes and loose women. In 1897, at their father's urging, {{she and her sister}} performed in the San Francisco stock company production of Quo Vadis. Gladys died, aged eight, of appendicitis while their father was on one of his drinking and philandering [...] "fishing trips". Anita continued appearing on stage, sometimes being the family's sole breadwinner. Eventually Beers Loos' spendthrift ways caught up with them, and in 1903, Beers Loos took an offer to manage a theater company in San Diego. There, Anita performed simultaneously in her father's stock company, and under another name with the more legitimate stock company in town. It was around this time that she started shaving years off her true age.|$|E
2500|$|Immediately, the {{overwhelming}} Polish majority of Lviv, {{a city of}} over 200,000, started an armed uprising that the 1,400 Ukrainian garrison consisting mostly of teenage peasants disoriented in the city were unable to quell. The Poles soon took control {{over most of the}} city centre. Unable to break into the central areas, Ukrainian forces besieged the city, defended by Polish irregular forces including the Lwów Eaglets. After the Inter-Allied Commission in Paris agreed to leave the city under Polish administration until its future was resolved by a post-war treaty or a referendum, the regular Polish forces reached the city on November 19 and by November 22, the Ukrainian troops were forced out. When the Polish forces captured the city, elements of Polish soldiery begun to loot and burn much of the Jewish and Ukrainian quarters of the city, killing approximately 340 civilians (see: Lwów pogrom (1918)). [...] After securing control of Lviv, Polish authorities shut down all Ukrainian institutions and societies, conducted mass arrests of Ukrainians, forced Ukrainians to work on Greek Catholic religious holidays, and dismissed most Ukrainian civil servants. [...] Ukrainian members of the city council resigned in protest, and no Ukrainian <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> city council until 1927.|$|E

2500|$|By 664, Empress Wu {{was said}} to be interfering so much in the {{imperial}} governance that she was angering Emperor Gaozong. Further, she had engaged the Taoist sorcerer Guo Xingzhen (郭行真) in using witchcraft—an act that was prohibited by regulations and which had led to Empress Wang's downfall—and the eunuch Wang Fusheng (王伏勝) reported this to Emperor Gaozong, further angering him. He consulted the chancellor Shangguan Yi, who suggested that he depose Empress Wu. He had Shangguan draft an edict, but as Shangguan was doing so Empress Wu received news of what was happening. She went to the emperor to plead her case, just as he was holding the edict that Shangguan had drafted. Emperor Gaozong could not bear to depose her, blaming the episode on Shangguan. As both Shangguan and Wang had served on Li Zhong's staff, Empress Wu had Xu falsely accuse Shangguan, Wang, and Li Zhong of planning treason. Shangguan, Wang, and Shangguan's son Shangguan Tingzhi (上官庭芝) were executed, while Li Zhong was forced to commit suicide. (Shangguan Tingzhi's daughter Shangguan Wan'er, then an infant, and her mother, Lady Zheng, became slaves in the inner palace. After Shangguan Wan'er grew up, she eventually became a trusted secretary for Empress Wu.) Thereafter, at imperial meetings, Empress Wu <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side of a curtain behind Emperor Gaozong, and they became referred to by the public as the [...] "Two Holy Ones" [...] (二聖, Er Sheng).|$|E
2500|$|... {{professional}} wrestling promoter Salvador Lutteroth began promoting wrestling, or Lucha libre {{events in}} Arena Modelo in 1933 as he founded Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (EMLL). The building {{served as the}} main venue for Lutteroth's promotion from 1933 until the early 1940s when the success of Lucha Libre meant that Arena Model was becoming too small to accommodate the weekly shows. Lutteroth financed {{the building of a}} new arena with $40,000 that he had won in the national lottery. The building <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> location of República de Perú 77 in the Cuauhtémoc and was designed by Architect Francisco Bullman. Upon its completion in 1943 it was the first sports building in Mexico to have built in Air Conditioning. The building would hold 8,863 spectators for wrestling or boxing events and quickly gained the nickname the [...] "Lagunilla Funnel" [...] due to the design of the spectators stands in regards to the ring in the middle. The venue began hosting Boxing events only a few months after opening and for years would run both wrestling and boxing events throughout the year. The venue served as the main building for EMLL, hosting their Anniversary shows starting with their 10th Anniversary show in 1943 through their 22nd Anniversary show in 1955. From 1956 and forward Arena Coliseo became a secondary venue for EMLL, with the newly constructed Arena México taking over as the venue for all of EMLL's major shows. In 1979, for unknown reasons EMLL held their 46th Anniversary Show in Arena Coliseo instead of Arena México, marking the last major EMLL event held there. In {{the weeks leading up to}} the 70th anniversary of Arena Coliseo CMLL began promoting the history of the arena, detailing its rich history of both boxing and wrestling as well as its role in Women's wrestling in Mexico, the championship matches that had taken place in the arena over the years and the large number of Luchas de Apuestas matches that had taken place on the premises and finally the deaths of boxers and wrestlers in the actual arena.|$|E
