5|$|The rotor of the <b>Wankel</b> <b>engine</b> {{is shaped}} as a {{curvilinear}} triangle {{that is often}} cited {{as an example of}} a Reuleaux triangle. However, its curved sides are somewhat flatter than those of a Reuleaux triangle and so it does not have constant width.|$|E
25|$|In a <b>Wankel</b> <b>engine,</b> the {{fuel-air}} mixture {{cannot be}} pre-stored {{because there are}} consecutive intake cycles. The engine has a 50% longer stroke duration than a reciprocating piston engine. The four Otto cycles last 1080° for a <b>Wankel</b> <b>engine</b> (three revolutions of the output shaft) versus 720° for a four-stroke reciprocating engine, but the four strokes are still the same proportion of the total.|$|E
25|$|A further {{advantage}} of the <b>Wankel</b> <b>engine</b> for use in aircraft is that it generally has a smaller frontal area than a piston engine of equivalent power, allowing a more aerodynamic nose to be designed around the engine. A cascading advantage is that the smaller size and lower weight of the <b>Wankel</b> <b>engine</b> allows for savings in airframe construction costs, compared to piston engines of comparable power.|$|E

25|$|In 2010 Audi {{unveiled}} a prototype series-hybrid electric car, the A1 e-tron, that incorporated a small 250cc <b>Wankel</b> <b>engine,</b> running at 5,000rpm, which recharged the car's batteries as needed, and provided electricity {{directly to the}} electric driving motor. In 2010, FEV Inc said that in their prototype electric version of the Fiat 500, a <b>Wankel</b> <b>engine</b> would {{be used as a}} range extender. In 2013, Valmet Automotive of Finland revealed a prototype car named the EVA, incorporating a Wankel powered series-hybrid powertrain car, utilizing an engine manufactured by the German company Wankel SuperTec. The UK company, Aixro Radial Engines, offers a range extender based on the 294cc-per-chamber go-kart engine.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the removal of internal reciprocating stresses by the complete removal of reciprocating internal parts typically found in a piston engine, the <b>Wankel</b> <b>engine</b> is constructed with an iron rotor within a housing made of aluminium, which has a greater coefficient of thermal expansion. This ensures that even a severely overheated <b>Wankel</b> <b>engine</b> cannot seize, as is {{likely to occur in}} an overheated piston engine. This is a substantial safety benefit when used in aircraft. In addition, the absence of valves and valve trains increases safety. GM tested an iron rotor and iron housing in their prototype Wankel engines, that worked at higher temperatures with lower specific fuel consumption.|$|E
50|$|Mazda has {{developed}} <b>Wankel</b> <b>engines</b> burning hydrogen. The advantage of using an internal combustion <b>engine,</b> like <b>Wankel</b> and piston <b>engines,</b> is the lower cost of retooling for production.|$|R

50|$|<b>Wankel</b> <b>engines</b> {{have such}} an {{elongated}} combustion chamber that even non-aero <b>wankel</b> <b>engines</b> may adopt dual ignition to promote better combustion, in some cases like the Mazda 787B racing car even triple ignition. The MidWest AE series Wankel aero-engine has twin plugs per chamber, but these are placed side-by-side, not sequentially, so their main purpose is to give redundancy rather than improved combustion.|$|R
25|$|The {{small size}} and {{attractive}} power to weight {{ratio of the}} <b>Wankel</b> <b>engine</b> appealed to motorcycle manufacturers. The first Wankel-engined motorcycle was the 1960 'IFA/MZ KKM 175W' built by German motorcycle manufacturer MZ, licensed by NSU.|$|E
25|$|Technology {{developments}} {{included the}} widespread use of independent suspensions, wider application of fuel injection, and an increasing focus on safety in automotive design. Innovations during the 1960s included NSU's <b>Wankel</b> <b>engine,</b> the gas turbine, and the turbocharger. Of these, only the last endured, pioneered by General Motors, and adopted by BMW and Saab, later seeing mass-market use during the 1980s by Chrysler. Mazda continued developing its <b>Wankel</b> <b>engine,</b> in spite of problems in longevity, emissions, and fuel economy. Other Wankel licensees, including Mercedes-Benz and GM, never put their designs into production because of engineering and manufacturing problems, as well as the lessons from the 1973 oil crisis.|$|E
25|$|In 1951, NSU Motorenwerke AG in Germany began {{development}} of the engine, with two models being built. The first, the DKM motor, was developed by Felix Wankel. The second, the KKM motor, developed by Hanns Dieter Paschke, was adopted {{as the basis of}} the modern <b>Wankel</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Wankel</b> <b>engines</b> became common {{place in}} motor sport events, this created {{the problem of}} {{correcting}} the representation of each engine's displacement as provided by the manufacturer, {{for the benefit of}} competition. Rather than force the majority of participants (driving piston engine cars) to half their quoted displacement (likely resulting in confusion), most racing organizations simply decided to double the quoted displacement of <b>Wankel</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R

25|$|The surface-to-volume-ratio in {{the moving}} {{combustion}} chamber is so complex that a direct comparison cannot {{be made between}} a reciprocating piston engine and a <b>Wankel</b> <b>engine.</b> The flow velocity and the heat losses are quite different. Surface temperature characteristics are completely different; the film {{of oil in the}} <b>Wankel</b> <b>engine</b> acts as insulation. Engines with a higher compression ratio have a worse surface-to-volume ratio. The surface-to-volume ratio of a reciprocating piston diesel engine is much poorer than a reciprocating piston gasoline engine, but diesel engines have a higher efficiency factor. Hence, comparing power outputs is a realistic metric. A reciprocating piston engine with equal power to a Wankel will be approximately twice the displacement. When comparing the power-to-weight ratio, physical size or physical weight to a similar power output piston engine, the Wankel is superior.|$|E
25|$|In the <b>Wankel</b> <b>engine,</b> {{the four}} strokes of an Otto cycle piston engine {{occur in the}} space between a three-sided {{symmetric}} rotor and the inside of a housing. In each rotor of the <b>Wankel</b> <b>engine,</b> the oval-like epitrochoid-shaped housing surrounds a rotor which is triangular with bow-shaped flanks (often confused with a Reuleaux triangle, a three-pointed curve of constant width, but with the bulge in the middle of each side a bit more flattened). The theoretical shape of the rotor between the fixed corners {{is the result of a}} minimization of the volume of the geometric combustion chamber and a maximization of the compression ratio, respectively. The symmetric curve connecting two arbitrary apexes of the rotor is maximized in the direction of the inner housing shape with the constraint that it not touch the housing at any angle of rotation (an arc is not a solution of this optimization problem).|$|E
25|$|In 1960, NSU, {{the firm}} that {{employed}} the two inventors, and the US firm Curtiss-Wright, signed a joint agreement. NSU were to concentrate on low- and medium-powered <b>Wankel</b> <b>engine</b> development and Curtiss-Wright developing high-powered engines, including aircraft engines of which Curtiss-Wright had decades of experience designing and producing. Curtiss-Wright recruited Max Bentele to head their design team.|$|E

25|$|Mazda {{is still}} {{continuing}} development of next-generation of Wankel engines. The company is researching engine laser ignition, which eliminates conventional spark plugs, direct fuel injection, and sparkless HCCI ignition. These {{lead to greater}} rotor eccentricity (equating to a longer stroke in a reciprocating engine), with improved elasticity and low revolutions-per-minute torque. Research by T. Kohno proved that installing a glow-plug in the combustion chamber improved part load and low revolutions per minute fuel economy by 7%. These innovations promise to improve fuel consumption and emissions. To improve fuel efficiency further, Mazda is looking at using the Wankel as a range-extender in series-hybrid cars, announcing a prototype, the Mazda2 EV, for press evaluation in November 2013. This configuration improves fuel efficiency and emissions. As a further advantage, running a <b>Wankel</b> <b>engine</b> at a constant speed gives greater engine life. Keeping to a near constant, or narrow band, of revolutions eliminates, or vastly reduces, many of the disadvantages of the <b>Wankel</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|E
25|$|From the {{combustion}} chamber shape and features, the fuel octane requirements of Wankel engines {{are lower than}} in reciprocating piston engines. The maximum road octane number requirements were 82 for a peripheral-intake port <b>wankel</b> <b>engine,</b> and less than 70 for a side-inlet port engine. From {{the point of view}} of oil refiners this may be an advantage in fuel production costs.|$|E
25|$|The {{boundary}} layer shields {{and the oil}} film act as thermal insulation, leading to a low temperature of the lubricating film (maximum ~ on a water-cooled <b>Wankel</b> <b>engine.</b> This gives a more constant surface temperature. The temperature around the spark plug {{is about the same}} as the temperature in the combustion chamber of a reciprocating engine. With circumferential or axial flow cooling, the temperature difference remains tolerable.|$|E
50|$|Where {{very high}} power-to-weight ratios are required, {{internal}} combustion engines {{appear in the}} form of combustion turbines or <b>Wankel</b> <b>engines.</b> Powered aircraft typically uses an ICE which may be a reciprocating engine. Airplanes can instead use jet engines and helicopters can instead employ turboshafts; both of which are types of turbines. In addition to providing propulsion, airliners may employ a separate ICE as an auxiliary power unit. <b>Wankel</b> <b>engines</b> are fitted to many unmanned aerial vehicles.|$|R

25|$|National {{agencies}} that tax automobiles according to displacement and regulatory bodies in automobile racing variously consider the <b>Wankel</b> <b>engine</b> to be {{equivalent to a}} four-stroke piston engine of 1.5 to 2 times the displacement of one chamber per rotor, {{even though there are}} three chambers per rotor. Some racing series have banned the Wankel altogether, along with all other alternatives to the traditional reciprocating piston four-stroke design.|$|E
25|$|From 1978 {{until his}} death, Chapman was {{involved}} with the American tycoon, John DeLorean, in his development of a stainless steel sports car, {{to be built in}} a factory in Northern Ireland which was majority-funded by the British government. The original concept design was for a mid-engine sports car, however difficulty in securing the original <b>Wankel</b> <b>engine</b> rights and design complications led to the rear-engine mount design.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Wankel</b> <b>engine</b> has the {{advantages}} of compact design and low weight over {{the most commonly used}} internal combustion engine employing reciprocating pistons. These advantages have given rotary engine applications in a variety of vehicles and devices, including: automobiles, motorcycles, racing cars, aircraft, go-karts, jet skis, snowmobiles, chainsaws, and auxiliary power units. The point of power to weight has been reached of under one pound weight per horsepower output.|$|E
