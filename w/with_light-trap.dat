40|$|Focal {{control of}} malaria vectors, a {{potentially}} cost-effective alternative to conventional control, requires a spatio-temporal {{understanding of the}} mosquitoes. Trapping of African malaria vectors has generally been limited to inside houses making distribution estimates dependent on the location of dwellings. The development of tent-traps to sample outdoor biting mosquitoes has enabled more independent estimates. Here we describe both temporal and spatial variation in mosquito movements in an irrigation project village in southern Mozambique. Six hundred and ninety-three tent-trap collections (525 of which were paired <b>with</b> <b>light-trap</b> collections), 552 exit collections and 391 collections of mosquitoes resting inside houses were undertaken from March 2005 to April 2006. Fifteen species of mosquito were collected (five exclusively as larvae). Mansonia africana {{was the most common}} finding, numbers being greatest away from the village. Only Anopheles funestus, An. tenebrosus and Culex quinquefasciatus were collected in greater numbers in light-traps compared to tent-traps. Among the common mosquitoes, correlations in numbers of mosquito collected in paired tent and in light-traps were significant for all but An. tenebrosus. Inverse distance weighting was used to produce raster density maps of the most common mosquitoes. All species, with minor variations, in both hot and cool seasons, were collected in greatest numbers close to the edges of the village where water suitable for larval development was available. All exophilic anophelines species tested negative for sporozoites. It is suggested that focal control of larvae, applied by the villagers themselves, could be a suitable alternative to conventional control in this and similar villages...|$|E

Quantitative benthic samples of larvae were taken from different microhabitats within stream riffles on 45 occasions, and combined <b>with</b> <b>light-trap</b> captures of adults, were used {{as a basis for}} investigating life-history patterns and estimating secondary production. Two species, Ephemera (Ephemera) spilosa and E. (Aethephemera) pictipennis were collected, of which the former was more abundant (mean densities ± 95 % confidence limits = 11. 06 ± 1. 48 versus 0. 48 ± 0. 26 indiv. m- 2). Larvae of E. (E.) spilosa were patchily distributed. Mean densities in microhabitats close to the stream banks, where sediments were relatively fine grained, were > 50 % greater than those in midstream; however, this difference was not statistically significant. Both ephemerids were univoltine in TPKFS, but emergence of adult E. (A.) pictipennis was highly synchronized (in April), while E. (E.) spilosa emerged later over a more extended period (mainly May-July). Annual production of E. (E.) spilosa (in terms of ash-free dry weight, AFDW) in the study reach was estimated at 24. 26 mg AFDW m- 2 using the size-frequency method; the dry-weight (DW) annual production estimate was 37. 28 mg DW m- 2. Densities of E. (A.) pictipennis were too low to allow reliable production estimates. Production: biomass ratios for E.

40|$|Light {{trapping}} in crystalline silicon (c-Si) {{solar cells}} {{is an essential}} building block for high efficiency solar cells targeting low material consumption and low costs. In this study, we present the successful implementation of highly efficient light-trapping back contacts, subsequent to the passivation of Si heterojunction solar cells. The back contacts are realized by texturing an amorphous silicon layer with a refractive index close to the one of crystalline silicon at {{the back side of}} the silicon wafer. As a result, decoupling of optically active and electrically active layers is introduced. In the long run, the presented concept has the potential to improve light trapping in monolithic Si multijunction solar cells as well as solar cell configurations where texturing of the Si absorber surfaces usually results in a deterioration of the electrical properties. As part of this study, different light-trapping textures were applied to prototype silicon heterojunction solar cells. The best path length enhancement factors, at high passivation quality, were obtained <b>with</b> <b>light-trapping</b> textures based on randomly distributed craters. Comparing a planar reference solar cell with an absorber thickness of 280 μm and additional anti-reflection coating, the short-circuit current density (JSC) improves for a similar solar cell <b>with</b> <b>light-trapping</b> back contact. Due to the light trapping back contact, the JSC is enhanced around 1. 8 mA cm− 2 to 38. 5 mA cm− 2 due to light trapping in the wavelength range between 1000 nm and 1150 nm...|$|R

Here we demonstrate that an inverted nanopyramid light-trapping scheme for c-Si thin films, fabricated at wafer scale via a low-cost wet etching process, significantly enhances absorption within the c-Si layer. A broadband enhancement in absorptance that approaches the Yablonovitch limit (Yablonovitch, E. J. Opt. Soc. Am. 1987, 72, 899 – 907) is achieved with minimal angle dependence.

40|$|The {{ecology of}} seven species of hydropsychid caddisflies was {{investigated}} in Tai Po Kau Forest Stream (TPKFS), New Territories, Hong Kong, {{over a two-year period}} (1977 - 79). Quantitative benthic samples were taken from different microhabitats in the stream on 47 occasions and, in combination <b>with</b> <b>light-trap</b> catches of adult caddisflies, were used to investigate life-history patterns and estimate secondary production. Cheumatopsyche spinosa (141. 9 individuals 0. 5 m- 2; 63 % of total hydropsychid densities) and C. ventricosa (54. 7 individuals 0. 5 m- 2; 24 %) were the most abundant hydropsychids in TPKFS, followed by Macrostemum fastosum (15. 2 individuals 0. 5 m- 2; 7 %). Hydatopsyche melli, Herbertorossia quadrata, Polymorphanisus astictus and Hydropsyche chekiangana were present at relatively low densities (each C. spinosa > C. ventricosa > Hydatopsyche melli > Herbertorossia quadrata > P. astictus > Hydropsyche chekiangana. Production:biomass (P:B) ratios varied from 3. 59 (Hydatopsyche melli, 1977 - 78) to 25. 46 (Herbertorossia quadrata, 1977 - 78), and P:B ratios (1977 - 79) decreased in the order C. ventricosa > C. spinosa > Herbertorossia quadrata > M. fastosum > Hydropsyche chekiangana > P. astictus > Hydatopsyche melli (Table II). Bivoltine species had the highest P:B ratios. All TPKFS hydropsychids (except P. astictus) were significantly more abundant in midstream microhabitats than close to the stream banks. This pattern was most marked in Hydatopsyche melli and Hydropsyche chekiangana. Multivariate statistics revealed that hydropsychid microdistribution was influenced significantly by sediment grain-size characteristics, although algae or detritus also had an influence on all species except Herbertorossia quadrata.

ZnO shows a {{unique set of}} physical and chemical properties, such as a wide band gap (3.37 eV), large exciton binding energy (60 meV) at room temperature, radiation hardness [1], piezoelectricity and photoelasticity [2] and surface chemistry sensitive to environment.

A total of 13 cephalopod genera was caught from monthly cruises conducted from October to January of 1990 - 91 and 1991 - 92. Octopus, the most abundant juvenile cephalopod, was present in relatively high numbers at all shelf locations; few were caught in the Coral Sea. Photololigo, the most abundant squid, was rarely caught outside the GBR Lagoon. In contrast, Sthenoteuthis, the second most abundant squid, was caught at all locations. Deep samples from most locations were dominated by Octopus. Abralia was found only {{near the bottom of the}} GBR Lagoon; in contrast, Euprymna, the fourth most abundant genus, was collected only at the surface. Cephalopod communities from the GBR Lagoon had higher abundances of Octopus, Photololigo and Abralia compared with communities from the three other areas. Reef passages and reef locations shared similar communities, with the squid component dominated by Sthenoteuthis. Very low numbers of cephalopods were caught in the Coral Sea by light attraction.

40|$|Processes {{occurring}} {{at the end}} of the larval stage are of major importance in shaping spatial structure of fish assemblages in coral reefs. However, because of the difficulty in identifying larvae to species, many studies dealing with these stages are limited to the family level. It remains unknown if variation in the spatial structure of coral-reef fish assemblages across life stages can be detected at such a coarse taxonomic level. Two different surveys conducted in a similar area of New Caledonia, Southwest Pacific, provided the opportunity to compare the structure of coral-reef fish assemblages collected as pre-settlement larvae, juveniles and adults along a coast to barrier reef gradient. Adult and juvenile fish were sampled using underwater visual counts (UVC) during the warm seasons of 2004 and 2005. Pre-settlement larvae were sampled <b>with</b> <b>light-traps</b> during the same seasons. In order to standardize data between sampling methods, analyses were conducted on the relative abundance (for larvae) and density (for juveniles and adults) of 21 families commonly collected with both methods. Relative abundances/densities of families were analysed as a function of life stage (larvae, juveniles or adults), large-scale spatial location (coast, lagoon or barrier) and years (2004, 2005) using non-parametric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (permanova). KruskalWallis tests were then used to examine differences among life stages and locations for individual families. Different levels of spatial and temporal variability characterized fish assemblages from different life stages, and differences among life stages were detected at all locations and years. Differences among life stages were also significant at the level of individual families. Overall results indicate that studies conducted at the family level may efficiently reveal changes in coral-reef fish spatial structure among successive life stages when large spatial scales are considered...|$|R

Most of these concepts make use of the coupling of incident sunlight to waveguide modes via nanophotonic structures such as photonic crystals, nanowires, or plasmonic gratings. Experimentally, light coupling to these modes was so far exclusively investigated with indirect and macroscopic methods, and thus, the nanoscale physics of light coupling and propagation of waveguide modes remain vague. In this contribution, we present a nanoscopic observation of light coupling to waveguide modes in a nanophotonic thin-film silicon solar cell. Making use of the subwavelength resolution of the scanning near-field optical microscopy, we resolve the electric field intensities of a propagating waveguide mode at the surface of a state-of-the-art nanophotonic thin-film solar cell. We identify the resonance condition for light coupling to this individual waveguide mode and associate it to a pronounced resonance in the external quantum efficiency that is found to increase significantly the power conversion efficiency of the device. We show that a maximum of the incident light couples to the investigated waveguide mode if the period of the electric field intensity of the waveguide mode matches the periodicity of the nanophotonic twodimensional grating.

40|$|Many {{types of}} insect, in {{particular}} the nocturnal Lepidoptera, will fly towards artificial sources of illumination. Such animals are often described as being positively phototactic, but although little {{progress has been made}} towards a fundamental understanding of this phenomenon, its existence continues to be exploited with the use of light-traps. This thesis attempts to explain, in part, why certain British night-flying Lepidoptera are caught, or fly close to, light-traps. The experimentation and analysis has been structured into three separate but inter-related studies. The first is an investigation into the effects that weather factors exert on light-trap catch. Standard analytical procedures were extended to reveal that sensitivity to these factors is related to insect size and gross morphology. The second of these studies is an analysis of the types of moth flight pattern produced when these insects are exposed to various forms of illumination under field conditions. Moth tracks were recorded on video with the help of image intensification, and the frame-by-frame co-ordinates transferred to, and processed by, a microcomputer, which produced matrix maps of speeds, accelerations and time-surface densities around a light-trap. Instantaneous windspeeds were recorded. The dynamical analysis suggests that moth flight towards light arises primarily from a misinterpretation of the stimulus, competing at short distances with a strong escape response, thus evoking a profound state of disorientation. Furthermore, the data indicated that the types of pattern found were species linked. In the third study, a remotesensing technique was used to quantify moth aerial density, which was compared <b>with</b> simultaneous <b>light-trap</b> catches nearby, giving an estimate of absolute trap catching efficiency under various meteorological conditions.

The minority carrier concentration at outer surface of shallow p(+) n heterojunction is greatly reduced by the electric field, drastically suppressing the surface recombination compared to the conventional p-i-n homojunction SNSC. Furthermore, larger junction area of p(+) n heterojunction facilitates the separation of photo-generated charge carriers.

However {{it is impossible to}} manufacture tandem PV cells at a low cost due to stringent fabrication standards and limited material types that satisfy lattice compatibility. Current produced by the tandem multi-junction PV cell is limited by the lowest junction due to series connection. Spectrum-splitting is a lateral multi-junction concept that is free of lattice and current matching constraints. Each PV cell can be optimized towards full absorption of a spectral band <b>with</b> tailored <b>light-trapping</b> schemes. Holographic optical components are designed to achieve spectrum-splitting PV energy conversion. The incident solar spectrum is separated onto multiple PV cells that are matched to the corresponding spectral band. Holographic spectrum-splitting can take advantage of existing and future low-cost technologies that produces high efficiency thin-film solar cells. Spectrum-splitting optical systems are designed and analyzed with both transmission and reflection holographic optical components. Prototype holograms are fabricated and high optical efficiency is achieved. Light-trapping in PV cells increases the effective optical path-length in the semiconductor material leading to improved absorption and conversion efficiency. It has been shown that the effective optical path length can be increased by a factor of 4 n 2 using diffusive surfaces. Ultra-light-trapping can be achieved with optical filters that limit the escape angle of the diffused light. Holographic reflection gratings have been shown to act as angle-wavelength selective filters that can function as ultra-light-trapping filters. Results from an experimental reflection hologram are used to model the absorption enhancement factor for a silicon solar cell and light-trapping filter. The result shows a significant improvement in current generation for thin-film silicon solar cells under typical operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} modelling methods {{that can be used to}} simulate the optics of solar cells. However, solar cells and modules having both nanoscale and microscale features are difficult to simulate and therefore optimise using existing methods. The aim of this thesis was to investigate new methods of modelling such photovoltaic (PV) devices <b>with</b> advanced <b>light-trapping</b> structures and to accurately predict their system output under real operating conditions (i. e., local spectrum and varying angles of incidence). This objective was achieved through the development of a new optical modelling framework called the Angular Matrix Framework (AMF). The AMF allows the front and rear surfaces of a wafer-based solar cell to be modelled using different simulation methods. In this way, optical features with different scales with respect to those of the solar cell can be efficiently modelled separately. The angular responses of these features are then stored in matrices and can be combined to simulate the optical properties of the device. The effectiveness and accuracy of the method were verified by comparing AMF simulations with experimental results and simulation results obtained using established methods. Examples also showed that AMF could be used to optimise optical elements of various devices (e. g., back contact cells, passivated contact cells, silicon tandem cells and modules). To exemplify the utility of the AMF, a nanoscale anodic aluminium oxide (AAO) /metal light trapping heterostructure was simulated and optimised using Finite Domain Time Domain (FDTD) methods and AMF to determine the optimal pore size and spacing of the AAO template. In addition, the use of the AMF to accurately predict the PV power generation of a rooftop array in Brisbane, Australia was demonstrated with the difference between the actual and AMF-predicted generation being 1. 30 % compared with 1. 66 % for predictions using the established method PVWatts, the daily standard deviation also being reduced to 0. 16 compared to 0. 27 for the PVWatts calculations. These results highlight the potential to use the AMF to optimise cell and module components for system operation in different geographical regions and illumination conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{investigate}} metal-induced crystallization of amorphous silicon at low temperatures using excitation sources such as laser and rapid thermal annealing, as well as, electric field. Deposition of high quality crystalline silicon at low temperatures allows the use of low cost soda-lime glass and polymeric films for economically viable photovoltaic solar cells and low cost large area flat panel displays. In light of current and expected demands on Si supply due to expanding use of consumer electronic products throughout {{the world and the}} incessant demand for electric power the need for developing high grade Si thin films on low cost substrate becomes even more important. We used hydrogenated and un-hydrogenated amorphous silicon deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition and sputtering techniques (both of which are extensively used in electronic and solar cell industries) to fabricate nano-crystalline, poly-crystalline (small as well as large grain), and single-crystalline (epitaxial) films at low temperatures. We demonstrated Si nanowires on flat surfaces {{that can be used for}} fabricating nanometer scale transistors. We also demonstrated lateral crystallization using Al with and without an applied electric field. These results are critical for high mobility thin film transistors (TFT) for large area display applications. Large grain silicon (~ 30 - 50 µm grain size for < 0. 5 µm thick films) was demonstrated on glass substrates at low temperatures. We also demonstrated epitaxial growth of silicon on (100) Si substrates at temperatures as low as 450 ˚C. Thin film Si solar cells are being projected as the material of choice for low cost high efficiency solar cells when properly coupled <b>with</b> excellent <b>light-trapping</b> schemes. Ar ion laser (CW) was shown to produce dendritic nanowire structures at low power whereas at higher powers yielded continuous polycrystalline films. The power density required for films in contact with Al was demonstrated to be at least two orders of magnitude lower that that reported in the literature before. Polysilicon was successfully achieved on polyimide (Kapton©) films. Thin film Si solar cells on lightweight stoable polymer offer great advantage for terrestrial and space power applications. In summary we have demonstrated through this research the viability of producing low cost nano-, poly-, and epitaxial Si material on substrates of choice for applications in economically viable environmentally friendly sustainable solar power systems. This truly enabling technology has widespread applications in multibillion dollar electronic industry and consumer products...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The Spur-throated Locust, Austracris guttulosa (Walker), a {{univoltine}} tropical {{species with}} reproductive diapause {{adapted to the}} monsoonal climate with a long dry season, {{does not appear to}} overwinter south of 30 ° S but often spreads to the temperate region for breeding in spring. The sexually immature adults often form swarms and cause severe damage to crops and trees in the tropical region of northern Australia, but whether they are partially returned from the south is not clear. Methods: The radar echo signature of Spur-throated Locust, which was previously defined from confirmed migration events, was used to identify migration events with the nightly observations of two special purpose-built entomological radars in the subtropical region of eastern Australia during 2007 – 2015. The detected migrations were evaluated <b>with</b> weather data, <b>light-trap</b> and field survey results, and the redistribution of adult populations was also examined. Results/Conclusion: Only a dozen en masse nocturnal long-distance migrations of A. guttulosa were registered on the radars in the past decade. However they were in both southward and northward directions, just more prominent to the south after overwintering. Light-traps detected much higher frequency of population movements, especially in the tropical Queensland during late autumn and winter. Survey data often showed the redistribution of adult populations after winter with much less abundance in the temperate region in early season. The results suggested that A. gutulosa might conduct round-trip migration in eastern Australia, and diurnal short-range swarm flights at low level might contribute significantly to the population redistribution...|$|R
40|$|My {{research}} has focused on the identification, assemblage dynamics, and horizontal distribution patterns of larval fishes around rocky reefs in the Gulf of California, Mexico. In Chapter One, I analyze a series of light-trap collections taken over 35 nights at San Carlos, Sonora. Nearly 14, 000 larvae from 19 families were collected. The five most abundant families contributed 90 % of the larvae and the top ten families contributed 99 %. Larvae of non-pelagic spawners (gobiids, labrisomids, tripterygiids, chaenopsids, pomacentrids, and bythitids) dominated the collections. Larval catches ranged from 7. 5 to 2330. 3 larvae/ 45 min, but changes in catch rate were not related to changes in ambient moonlight. In contrast, the volume of zooplankton collected was correlated with moonlight intensity. Dynamics of the ten dominant fish families were highly variable, but in most cases {{a large proportion of the}} larvae were caught on just a few nights. Taxonomic and size selectivities were apparently less severe in my study than in previous Australian studies, and the use of light-traps should be explored further. In Chapter Two, I outline the prediction that larvae of small, non-pelagic spawning fishes should more frequently be retained over reefs during development than fishes with other combinations of body size and egg type, and I describe my research testing this prediction. I made about 160 collections of fish larvae <b>with</b> a <b>light-trap</b> and plankton net at 1, 20, and 100 m from rocky shorelines. These collections yielded 27, 265 larvae from about 50 families. Based on larval size frequencies, near-reef concentration gradients, and abundances offshore, I identified four families that can complete development over the reef but also have larvae dispersed offshore (Clupeidae, Engraulididae, Gerreidae, and Haemulidae). In addition, I identified seven families that primarily develop over reefs and have few or no larvae dispersed offshore (Tripterygiidae, Chaenopsidae, some Labrisomidae, Dactyloscopidae, some Gobiidae, Gobiesocidae, and Bythitidae). Adults of these seven families are mostly small, non-pelagic spawners. Larvae from four taxa of larger non-pelagic spawners (Ophioblennius, Labrisomus, Balistes, and Pomacentridae) did not appear to develop over reefs. These findings are in accord with the prediction I made. Chapter Three is a preliminary guide to identification of Gulf of California blennioid larvae. Although blennioid larvae are poorly known and few species have been described, they are well represented (ca. 20, 000 larvae from five families) in my collections taken near reefs in the Gulf. Illustrations of 20 species, and brief descriptions of key characters for these and several additional species, are provided. More detailed taxonomic studies on Gulf blenniid, dactyloscopid, tripterygiid, labrisomid, and chaenopsid larvae are in progress...|$|R
40|$|Este estudo determinou a riqueza de espécies e a abundância relativa dos flebotomíneos da comunidade de Lagoas, em Buriticupu, na Amazônia Maranhense. O estudo consistiu na captura de formas adultas com auxílio de armadilhas luminosas tipo CDC e armadilha de Shannon, das 18 às 6 horas, uma vez por mês, de dezembro/ 95 a janeiro/ 97, em ambiente florestal e extraflorestal (peri e intradomicílios). No total, capturou-se 9. 392 espécimens (4. 302 machos e 5. 090 fêmeas) distribuídos em 38 espécies (1 Brumptomyia e 37 Lutzomyia). A riqueza e abundância de espécies foram maiores na mata, seguida do peri e intradomicílio. Na mata, as espécies mais freqüentes foram Lutzomyia whitmani (64, 9 %), L. migonei (27 %) e L. serrana (3, 6 %). No peridomicílio, predominaram L. evandroi (55, 4 %), L. whitmani (33, 4 %) e L. migonei (6, 4 %) e no intra, L. evandroi (97, 9 %). O predomínio no ambiente silvestre resulta das potencialidades ainda encontradas nas glebas remanescentes da floresta tão explorada pelas atividades madeireira e agropecuária. Por outro lado, a peridomiciliação de 7, 7 % das espécies reverteu-se de grande importância epidemiológica, haja visto a existência de pacientes com leishmanioses que julgam ter adquirido a infecção nas proximidades de suas habitações. In {{this study}} the {{diversity}} of the species and relative abundance of the sand flies in the Amazonian community of Lagoas, in Buriticupu, Maranhão State, was determined. The study consisted of adult sandflies captured <b>with</b> CD <b>light-traps,</b> Shannon-trap and manual aspiration tube, between 18 PM and 6 AM, once a month, from December/ 95 to January/ 97, in a forest fragment and in the domestic environment (peri and intra). In all, 9, 393 specimens were captured (4, 302 males and 5, 140 females) distributed among 38 species (1 Brumptomyia and 37 Lutzomyia). The diversity and abundance of species was higher in the forest, followed by the peri and intra. The predominance in the wild ambient is a consequence of the potentialities found in the remaining fragments of the forest which have survived the lumber yard exploitation and agricultural activities. In the forest environment Lutzomyia whitmani (64. 9 %), L. migonei (27 %) and L. serrana (3. 6 %) were the most frequent species. In the peri and intra domicile L. evandroi predominated (55. 4 % and 97. 9 %). The species, L. whitmani (33. 4 %) and L. migonei (6. 4 %), were important in the peri domicile. The peridomestic habit of 7. 7 % of the sand flies showed the greatest epidemiologic importance, due to the existence of patients with leishmaniasis ulcers, who believe they were infected near their habitations...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{represents}} a systematic study of amorphous silicon microcrystalline silicon and germanium thin films, and a-Si:H thin film solar cells fabricated using an OPT plasma lab 100 RF PECVD system {{carried out with}} a view to studying novel lighttrapping structures for thin film solar cells and novel IR photovoltaic cells. The work includes the optimisation of amorphous based single layers by optical and electrical characterisation, their doping and the fabrication and optimisation of single junction solar cells. These developments were extended to include deposition of microcrystalline and germanium films with the aim of developing a range of multijunction and single junction research devices. The optical characterisation of intrinsic amorphous based layers shows that device-grade layer fabrications are achievable with more than 90 % absorption in the 450 to 550 nm wavelength range which can be deposited at 4 - 5 ?A/s with good thickness uniformity. The bandgap of intrinsic amorphous layers can be tuned from 1. 4 to 1. 7 eV. Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (SIMS) depth profile characterisation has verified that doping levels in p-type and n type are in the range of 1021 atoms/cm 3 which can maintain high open circuit voltage of 0. 83 V in the single junction device. Systematic single layers well as in-device optimisations lead to the best single junction devices fabricated at a temperature of 250 oC and at a pressure of 350 mT and of initially 8. 22 % efficiency. Initial quantum efficiency (QE) measurements show 75 % photon absorption at 550 nm wavelength. A novel technique of wavelength and angle resolved scattering (WARS) measurements have been used to analyse the effects of textured TCOs on light-trapping in single junction device. Showing Asahi-U to be the best substrate <b>with</b> regards to <b>light-trapping,</b> although thicker films benefited more from TEC 8. Deposition of microcrystalline silicon and germanium have also been reported. More focus has been given to optical characterisation of germanium films whose absorption has reached more than 70 % in 400 to 1600 nm wavelength range with successful n-type and p-type doping. Ohmic contacts with a low resistivity of 0. 029 -cm for p-type Ge with the usage of Ni have been achieved. The overall working capacity of the OPT PECVD tool has been analysed and it was concluded that chamber design modification are essential for the system to work in a multidisciplinary field to avoid serious chamber contamination and 10 % efficient a:Si:H benchmarks...|$|R
