25|$|Also {{known as}} bats, flying mice, or wands, these devices {{generally}} function through ultrasound and provide {{at least three}} degrees of freedom. Probably the best known example would be 3Dconnexion/Logitech's SpaceMouse from the early 1990s. In the late 1990s Kantek introduced the 3D RingMouse. This <b>wireless</b> <b>mouse</b> was worn on a ring around a finger, which enabled the thumb to access three buttons. The mouse was tracked in three dimensions by a base station. Despite a certain appeal, it was finally discontinued {{because it did not}} provide sufficient resolution.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, the VTech Socrates {{educational}} {{video game}} console featured a <b>wireless</b> <b>mouse</b> with an attached mouse pad as an optional controller used for some games. In the early 1990s, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System video game system featured a mouse {{in addition to}} its controllers. The Mario Paint game in particular used the mouse's capabilities as did its successor on the N64. Sega released official mice for their Genesis/Mega Drive, Saturn and Dreamcast consoles. NEC sold official mice for its PC Engine and PC-FX consoles. Sony released an official mouse product for the PlayStation console, included one along with the Linux for PlayStation 2 kit, as well as allowing owners to use virtually any USB mouse with the PS2, PS3, and PS4. Nintendo's Wii also had this added on in a later software update, retained on the Wii U.|$|E

5000|$|The Apple <b>Wireless</b> <b>Mouse</b> is a one button mouse {{built for}} Macintosh computers. It was {{released}} in September 2003, {{although it is not}} widely recognized that it was Apple's primary <b>wireless</b> <b>mouse</b> until 2005. It interacts over Bluetooth 1.1 wireless technology. It included 2 AA lithium non-rechargeable batteries, and had a power switch on the bottom that also protected the optical sensor while the mouse was not in use. While the Industrial design of the Apple <b>Wireless</b> <b>Mouse</b> was handled entirely by Apple's in-house designers, some of the hardware was engineered by Sparkfactor Design.

40|$|Abstract—Logitech {{made the}} {{following}} statement in 2009 : “Since the displacements of a mouse would not give any useful information to a hacker, the mouse reports are not encrypted. ” In this paper, we prove the exact opposite is true- i. e., it is indeed possible to leak sensitive information such as passwords through the displacements of a Bluetooth mouse. Our results can be easily extended to other <b>wireless</b> <b>mice</b> using different radio links. We begin by presenting multiple ways to sniff unencrypted Bluetooth packets containing raw mouse movement data. We then show that such data may reveal text-based passwords entered by clicking on software keyboards. We propose two attacks, the prediction attack and replay attack, which can reconstruct the on-screen cursor trajectories from sniffed mouse movement data. Two inference strategies are used to discover passwords from cursor trajectories. We conducted a holistic study over all popular operating systems and analyzed how mouse acceleration algorithms and packet losses may affect the reconstruction results. Our real-world experiments demonstrate the severity of privacy leakage from unencrypted Bluetooth mice. We also discuss countermeasures to prevent privacy leakage from <b>wireless</b> <b>mice.</b> To {{the best of our}} knowledge, our work is the first to demonstrate privacy leakage from raw mouse data...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Current {{wireless}} {{human-computer interaction}} {{devices such as}} <b>wireless</b> <b>mice</b> and touchscreens, by-and-large, incorporate a sophisticated electronic architecture. The sophistication achieves wireless capabilities but carries over a cost overhead. In this paper we {{lay the foundation for}} developing a novel human-computer interaction device with reduced hardware sophistication. We developed a surface acoustic wave touchscreen-type device using only two transducers, as opposed to, typically, three or more transducers in conventional surface acoustic wave touchscreens. The transducers are mounted on a glass surface and connected into the line-in of a stereo sound card. User-initiated taps are detected, analysed and located on the surface, and the mouse cursor is moved to the computed screen location.

50|$|The Surface tablet has {{a display}} of 1366x768 pixels on a five-point multi-touch {{touchscreen}} with Gorilla Glass 2. The device measures 10.81 x 6.77 x 0.37 in and is made from magnesium. The kickstand, USB port and a magnetic keyboard interface give the Surface ability to add a <b>wireless</b> <b>mouse,</b> external keyboard or a thumb drive.

50|$|Microsoft also {{introduced}} {{one of the}} first mainstream ergonomic mice, the Microsoft Natural <b>Wireless</b> Laser <b>Mouse</b> 6000.
