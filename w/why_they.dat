5|$|The velites {{were placed}} {{at the front of}} the maniples, so that the velites had the chance to prove {{themselves}} and win glory by seeking out single combat with an enemy. This is also <b>why</b> <b>they</b> wore highly identifiable wolfskin headdresses.|$|E

5|$|All {{roads in}} and out of Ringgold were closed until the morning of April 29; after roads leading to the {{affected}} areas were re-opened, residents and business owners were allowed to return, being allowed entry only by providing identification, and informing police a reason <b>why</b> <b>they</b> were entering into the area, in order to curb looting in the storm-damaged areas.|$|E
5|$|As is {{discussed}} below, {{the reason for}} the delay was probably simply that neither the Athenians nor the Persians were willing to risk battle initially. This then raises the question of why the battle occurred when it did. Herodotus explicitly tells us that the Greeks attacked the Persians (and the other sources confirm this), {{but it is not clear}} <b>why</b> <b>they</b> did this before the arrival of the Spartans. There are two main theories to explain this.|$|E

5|$|During {{a sabbatical}} year at Princeton University in 1960, Christy began an {{investigation}} of Cepheid variables and the smaller RR Lyrae variables, classes of luminous variable stars.

This earned him the Royal Astronomical Society's Eddington Medal for contributions to theoretical astrophysics in 1967.|$|E
5|$|Huggins {{attended}} Woodward High School, Walnut Hills High School, {{and later}} the University of Cincinnati., where he studied law and played college baseball for the Cincinnati Bearcats baseball team.

5|$|In May, 2011 {{more than}} 2,000 of the {{estimated}} 8,000 investors who lost money {{in the collapse of}} GSL took legal action seeking damages from Great Southern.

5|$|Leonardo's notes {{appear to}} have been {{intended}} for publication because many of the sheets have a form and order that would facilitate this.

5|$|Sorrell {{explained}} that, {{during the}} marketing campaign, the team were frequently {{asked to go}} to graveyards for photo-shoots. These usually went without incident, but on one occasion a vicar asked them <b>why</b> <b>they</b> were filming on church property. They lied by telling him that they were students filming a documentary on churches. Marketing campaigns also incorporated Sony Cambridge Studio's humour.|$|E
5|$|The Athsheans {{perceive}} the Terrans as an insane people, {{partly because of}} the disconnect amongst the Terrans between conscious, rational thinking and subconscious drives. The Terrans frequent use of hallucinogens is seen as the closest they are able to get to understanding their own subconscious.

5|$|The Sundance Channel, {{which was}} {{partially}} owned by media conglomerate Viacom, divided TransGenerations production cost with Logo TV, an LGBT-themed cable channel that Viacom {{was preparing to}} launch.
