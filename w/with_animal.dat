5|$|The {{physiological}} {{similarities between}} humans and other animals, especially primates, have led to more comparative research between the two groups.

40|$|Interactions <b>with</b> <b>animals</b> are {{pervasive}} in human life, {{a fact that}} {{is reflected in the}} burgeoning field of human-animal relations research. The goal of the current research was to examine the psychology of our social connection <b>with</b> other <b>animals,</b> by specifically developing a measure of solidarity <b>with</b> <b>animals.</b> In 8 studies using correlational, experimental, and longitudinal designs, solidarity <b>with</b> <b>animals</b> predicted more positive attitudes and behaviors toward animals, over and above existing scales of identification, and even when this implied a loss of resources and privileges for humans relative to <b>animals.</b> Solidarity <b>with</b> <b>animals</b> also displayed predicted relationships with relevant variables (anthropomorphism, empathy). Pet owners and vegetarians displayed higher levels of solidarity <b>with</b> <b>animals.</b> Correlational and experimental evidence confirmed that human-animal similarity heightens solidarity <b>with</b> <b>animals.</b> Our findings provide a useful measure that can facilitate important insights into the nature of our relationships <b>with</b> <b>animals.</b> Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R

5|$|The Malla king of Nepal Srinivasa Malla {{built the}} Patan durbar (court) in 1667 AD and is {{believed}} to have seen the Matrikas dance in the durbar one night. The king ordered that the Ashta-matrika be worshipped during the Ashwin Navaratri and cost is defrayed by the durbar. The custom continues til this day. Another festival Ghorajatra is celebrated in Patan <b>with</b> <b>animal</b> sacrifices to the Matrikas.|$|E
5|$|The Yavapai built brush shelter {{dwellings}} called Wa'm bu nya:va (Wom-boo-nya-va). In summer, {{they built}} simple lean-tos without walls. During winter months, closed huts (called uwas) {{would be built}} of ocotillo branches or other wood and covered <b>with</b> <b>animal</b> skins, grasses, bark, and/or dirt. In the Colorado River area, Ɖo:lkabaya built Uwađ a'mađva, a rectangular hut, that had dirt piled up against its sides for insulation, and a flat roof. They also sought shelter in caves or abandoned pueblos to escape the cold.|$|E

5|$|In 2010 a rock {{coloured}} red, {{orange and}} yellow was unearthed. Although containers of pigments {{have been found}} previously at sites such as Skara Brae, {{this was the first}} discovery in Britain, and possibly in Northern Europe, of evidence that Neolithic peoples used paint to decorate their buildings. It is thought that the primitive paint could have been made from iron ore, mixed <b>with</b> <b>animal</b> fat, milk or eggs. Only a week later a stone with a zigzag chevron pattern painted with a red pigment was discovered nearby.|$|E
5|$|Mark Whitton founded Whitton's in {{the early}} 1900s {{carrying}} timber with a horse and cart. After World War I the company carried coal to the gas works and local paper mills.

During the Second World War they were run by the Ministry of Transport {{and after the war}} were nationalised to become part of British Road Services. The brothers who had owned the company moved back into haulage, setting up a new firm which went into receivership in the 1970s and was then bought by Wild Transport of Exeter in 1973.|$|E
5|$|Rodin's sister Maria, {{two years}} his senior, died of {{peritonitis}} in a convent in 1862. Rodin was anguished and felt guilty {{because he had}} introduced Maria to an unfaithful suitor. Turning away from art, he briefly joined a Catholic order, the Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament. Saint Peter Julian Eymard, founder {{and head of the}} congregation, recognized Rodin's talent and, sensing his lack of suitability for the order, encouraged Rodin to continue with his sculpture. He returned to work as a decorator, while taking classes <b>with</b> <b>animal</b> sculptor Antoine-Louis Barye. The teacher's attention to detail– his finely rendered musculature of animals in motion– significantly influenced Rodin.|$|E

5|$|The Avars had mounted archers with {{composite}} bows {{that could}} double as heavy cavalry with lances. They were skilled in siegecraft and could construct trebuchets and siege towers. In their siege of Constantinople, they constructed walls of circumvallation to prevent easy counterattack and used mantelets or wooden frames covered <b>with</b> <b>animal</b> hides {{to protect against}} defending archers. Furthermore, like many nomads, they gathered other warriors such as Gepids and Slavs to assist them. However, since Avars depended on raiding the countryside for supplies, {{it was difficult for}} them to maintain long sieges, especially when considering their less mobile gathered allies.|$|E
5|$|The Māori {{had many}} {{uses for the}} gum, which they called kapia. Fresh gum {{was used as a}} type of chewing gum (older gum was {{softened}} by soaking and mixing with juice of the puha thistle). Highly flammable, the gum was also used as a fire-starter, or bound in flax to act as a torch. Burnt and mixed <b>with</b> <b>animal</b> fat, it made a dark pigment for moko tattooing. Kauri gum was also crafted into jewellery, keepsakes, and small decorative items. Like amber, kauri gum sometimes includes insects and plant material.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{preclinical}} research <b>with</b> <b>animal</b> {{and human}} proteins, bupropion {{has been characterized}} as a weak norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). It has also been found {{to act as a}} releasing agent of dopamine and norepinephrine (NDRA), similarly to other cathinones. However, when ingested orally by humans, bupropion is extensively converted in the body into several active metabolites with differing activities and influences on the effects of the drug during first-pass metabolism. These metabolites are present in much higher concentrations in the body compared to bupropion itself. The most important example is the major metabolite of bupropion, hydroxybupropion, a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (and likely releasing agent) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonist that lacks significant dopaminergic actions, and which, with oral bupropion treatment, can reach area under the curve (AUC) plasma concentrations that are as much as 16–20times greater than those of bupropion itself. Hence, the effects of bupropion cannot be understood unless its metabolism is also considered.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{cinematic}} techniques by which von Stroheim portrayed naturalism was animal symbolism. In Greed McTeague {{is associated with}} a canary, only briefly mentioned in the novel. Von Stroheim altered Norris's original ending and has McTeague release the canary in Death Valley. McTeague buys Trina a female canary as a wedding gift and early in their marriage von Stroheim cuts from a shot of them kissing to birds fluttering wildly in their cage. Another scene <b>with</b> <b>animal</b> imagery includes cross-cutting between a cat attempting to pounce on the canaries in the scene where Schouler bids goodbye to McTeague and Trina without telling them that he has informed on McTeague. Dogs, cats and monkeys are associated with various supporting characters. Von Stroheim also used the naturalist technique of giving characters specific objects, gestures or phrases that repeat throughout the film as a visual leitmotif. For example, Trina tugs on her lips and McTeague fiddles with his birdcage.|$|E
5|$|The Celts practiced {{advanced}} {{agriculture and}} favored fertile lands; they {{brought with them}} and disseminated the inventions, including a variety of tools, and other achievements of La Tène culture. Celtic farmers used plows with iron shares and fertilized fields <b>with</b> <b>animal</b> manure. Their livestock consisted of selected breeds, especially sheep and large cattle. The rotational querns that they invented had a stationary lower stone and an upper one rotated by a lever. Iron was obtained in greater quantities from locally available turf ores; its metallurgy and processing were improved, resulting in the manufacturing of stronger and more resistant tools and weapons. The ceramic shops used the potter's wheel and produced with great precision (especially the Tyniec group) baked, thin walled, painted vessels, {{one of the best}} in Europe. Domed bilevel furnaces were used, the pots being placed on a perforated clay shelf, with the hearth underneath. Glass and enamel were produced, gold and semi-precious stones were processed for jewelry.|$|E

5|$|Variation and Evolution in Plants was {{the first}} book to provide a wide-ranging {{explanation}} of how evolutionary mechanisms operated in plants at the genetic level. It brought concepts related to plant evolution into line <b>with</b> <b>animal</b> evolution as it emerged from Dobzhansky's 1937 Genetics and the Origin of Species and provided the conceptual framework to organize a disparate set of disciplines into a new field: plant evolutionary biology. In the book Stebbins argued that evolution needed to be studied as a dynamic problem and that evolution must be considered on three levels: first, that of individual variation within an interbreeding population; second, that of the distribution and frequency of this variation; and third, that of the separation and divergence of populations {{as the result of}} the building up of isolating mechanisms leading to the formation of species. He used the work of biosystematists Clausen, Keck, Hiesey, and Turesson to show that it was possible to distinguish between genotypic and phenotypic variationthat is, genetically identical plants could have different phenotypes in different environments. One of the book's most original chapters used the cytogenetics work of C. D. Darlington to show that genetic systems like hybridization and polyploidy were also subject to selection.|$|E
