Jochi, however, had become ill, which meant no reinforcements would be coming.|$|E
5|$|A call {{like this}} might be a bit ambiguous, but it was unsettling to those <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side of the status quo. Yiddish theater was banned in Russia {{starting}} September 14, 1883, as part of the anti-Jewish reaction following the assassination of Czar Alexander II. Goldfaden and his troupe were left adrift in Saint Petersburg. They headed various directions, some to England, some to New York City, some to Poland, some to Romania.|$|E
5|$|Halo: First Strike {{opens with}} the arrival of the Covenant armada at the human stronghold planet of Reach. The book follows both the {{unsuccessful}} attempt to defend Reach by the SPARTAN-IIs <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> planet's surface and the adventures of the rag-tag survivors of the battle at Alpha Halo. The book also reveals that humanity's worst fear is going to come true: the Covenant is on its way to Earth. The book was well received by critics and sold well, making The New York Times Best Seller list. Critics found it added depth to the Halo video games and that it was exciting throughout.|$|E

5|$|By 1606 {{the missionaries}} had {{concentrated}} many Manche Ch'ols in nine new mission towns, and {{had started to}} penetrate {{the territory of the}} neighbouring Mopan Maya, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> borders of the fiercely independent Itza of central Petén. By 1628 the Dominicans were tending to 6,000 Maya in the part of Manche Ch'ol territory that they had gained access to. This figure included some apostate refugees from Spanish-controlled Cahabón. Estimates of the total Manche Ch'ol population in the mid-17th century vary from 10,000 to 30,000, with prominent 20th-century Mayanist J. Eric S. Thompson preferring the lower figure as opposed to the high-end estimates by 17th-century chroniclers. The Dominican penetration of Mopan territory alarmed the Itza, who started to harass the Manche Ch'ol, driving them away from the mission towns.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1798 Sérurier {{temporarily}} {{commanded the}} divisions left in Italy {{where he had}} his hands full trying to calm unpaid soldiers <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> verge of mutiny. Bonaparte did not take him on the French campaign in Egypt and Syria {{because he was too}} old. Sometime after February 1798, he was ordered to the Army of England where he made his headquarters at Rennes. On 15 September he became Inspector General of the troops in the interior of France. On 5 November 1798 he transferred back to Italy to serve under Army of Italy commander Joubert. Sérurier was ordered by Joubert to occupy Livorno, but instructions soon changed to invade the Republic of Lucca. His cavalry entered Lucca on 22 December 1798 and extorted large sums of cash and clothing for the army's use. Sérurier's 6,000 infantry arrived at the city on 2 January 1799. After declaring that Lucca was a French-style republic on 25 January, he handed it over to Miollis on 5 February and returned to Mantua. At that time, the Army of Italy was led by Schérer who gave Sérurier command of the Tyrol Division with a paper strength of 8,328 men.|$|E
5|$|The rural Fasci in {{particular}} were a curious phenomenon: both ancient and modern. They combined millenarian aspirations with urban intellectual leadership often {{in contact with}} workers’ organizations and ideas in the more industrialized Northern Italy. According to the Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm, the Fasci were millenarian insofar as the socialism preached by the movement was seen by the Sicilian peasantry as a new religion, the true religion of Christ – betrayed by the priests, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side of the rich – that foretold {{the dawn of a}} new world, without poverty, hunger and cold, in accordance with God’s will. The Fasci, which included many women, were encouraged by the messianic belief that {{the start of a new}} reign of justice was looming and the movement spread like an epidemic.|$|E

25|$|The Portuguese {{army had}} been modernized in 1762 by William, Count of Schaumburg-Lippe but the army's {{administration}} soon became corrupt. Colonels and captains collected pay and supplies {{from the government}} for their soldiers. But the temptation to profit from this arrangement proved irresistible. The poorly paid officers often pocketed funds for soldiers <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> muster rolls but absent or non-existent. Graft and embezzlement led to understrength units, cavalrymen without horses, and regimental depots without supplies.|$|E
