25|$|Long {{before the}} No. 4 Mk I, Britain had {{obviously}} {{settled on the}} rear aperture sight prior to WWI, with modifications to the SMLE being tested as early as 1911, as well as later on the No. 1 Mk III pattern rifle. These unusual rifles have something of a mysterious service history, but represent a missing link in SMLE development. The primary distinguishing feature of the No. 1 Mk V is the rear aperture sight. Like the No. 1 Mk III* it lacked a volley sight and had the <b>wire</b> <b>loop</b> {{in place of the}} sling swivel at the front of magazine well along with the simplified cocking piece. The Mk V did retain a magazine cut-off, but without a spotting hole, the piling swivel was kept attached to a forward barrel band, which was wrapped over and attached {{to the rear of the}} nose cap to reinforce the rifle for use with the standard Pattern 1907 bayonet. Other distinctive features include a nose cap screw was slotted for the width of a coin for easy removal, a safety lever on the left side of the receiver was slightly modified with a unique angular groove pattern, and the two-piece hand guard being extended from the nose cap to the receiver, omitting the barrel mounted leaf sight. No. 1 Mk V rifles were manufactured solely by R.S.A.F. Enfield from 1922–1924, with a total production of roughly 20,000 rifles, all of which marked with a “V”.|$|E

40|$|Radiated {{emissions}} from equipment commonly originate from electronic circuits {{that act as}} electric dipoles created by the signal voltage between the signal conductors or as magnetic dipoles formed by the signal current flowing in a loop. Direct emission is mostly small, but circuits often couple to long conductors or large <b>wiring</b> <b>loops</b> which act as antennas and are efficient radiators. A comparable situation exists when short dipole antennas or small <b>wiring</b> <b>loops</b> receive ambient noise (susceptibility). Usually the amplitude of noise sources or the susceptibility of circuits is an invariable. The dipole strength increases with {{the distance between the}} conductors and the area. Shielding and proper grounding decreases the interaction via unintentional antennas. Short-circuiting and the insertion of lossy ferrite cores reduce the efficiency of unintentional antennas...|$|R

2500|$|In cutting mode {{electrode}} {{touches the}} tissue, and sufficiently high power density {{is applied to}} vaporize its water content. Since water vapor is not conductive under normal circumstances, electric current cannot flow through the vapor layer. Energy delivery beyond the vaporization threshold can continue if sufficiently high voltage is applied (> +/-200 V) [...] to ionize vapor and convert it into a conductive plasma. Vapor and fragments of the overheated tissue are ejected, forming a crater. Electrode surfaces intended {{to be used for}} cutting often feature a finer wire or <b>wire</b> <b>loop,</b> as opposed to a more flat blade with a rounded surface.|$|E
2500|$|Inspired by {{the work}} of Italian {{psychiatrist}} Amarro Fiamberti, Freeman at some point conceived of approaching the frontal lobes through the eye sockets instead of through drilled holes in the skull. In 1945 he took an icepick from his own kitchen and began testing the idea on grapefruit and cadavers. This new [...] "transorbital" [...] lobotomy involved lifting the upper eyelid and placing the point of a thin surgical instrument (often called an orbitoclast or leucotome, although quite different from the <b>wire</b> <b>loop</b> leucotome described above) under the eyelid and against the top of the eyesocket. A mallet was used to drive the orbitoclast through the thin layer of bone and into the brain along the plane of the bridge of the nose, around fifteen degrees toward the interhemispherical fissure. The orbitoclast was malleted five centimeters (2in) into the frontal lobe, and then pivoted forty degrees at the orbit perforation so the tip cut toward {{the opposite side of the}} head (toward the nose). The instrument was returned to the neutral position and sent a further two centimeters (in) into the brain, before being pivoted around twenty-eight degrees each side, to cut outwards and again inwards. (In a more radical variation at the end of the last cut described, the butt of the orbitoclast was forced upwards so the tool cut vertically down the side of the cortex of the interhemispherical fissure; the [...] "Deep frontal cut".) All cuts were designed to transect the white fibrous matter connecting the cortical tissue of the prefrontal cortex to the thalamus. The leucotome was then withdrawn and the procedure repeated on the other side.|$|E
2500|$|On 12 November 1935 at the Hospital Santa Marta in Lisbon, Moniz {{initiated}} {{the first of}} a series of operations on the brains of the mentally ill. The initial patients selected for the operation were provided by the medical director of Lisbon's Miguel Bombarda Mental Hospital, José de Matos Sobral Cid. As Moniz lacked training in neurosurgery and his hands were crippled from gout, the procedure was performed under general anaesthetic by Pedro Almeida Lima, who had previously assisted Moniz with his research on cerebral angiography. The intention was to remove some of the long fibres that connected the frontal lobes to other major brain centres. To this end, it was decided that Lima would trephine into the side of the skull and then inject ethanol into the [...] "subcortical white matter of the prefrontal area" [...] so as to destroy the connecting fibres, or association tracts, and create what Moniz termed a [...] "frontal barrier". After the first operation was complete, Moniz considered it a success and, observing that the patient's depression had been relieved, he declared her [...] "cured" [...] although she was never, in fact, discharged from the mental hospital. Moniz and Lima persisted with this method of injecting alcohol into the frontal lobes for the next seven patients but, after having to inject some patients on numerous occasions to elicit what they considered a favourable result, they modified the means by which they would section the frontal lobes. For the ninth patient they introduced a surgical instrument called a leucotome; this was a cannula that was [...] in length and [...] in diameter. It had a retractable <b>wire</b> <b>loop</b> at one end that, when rotated, produced a [...] diameter circular lesion in the white matter of the frontal lobe. Typically, six lesions were cut into each lobe, but, if they were dissatisfied by the results, Lima might perform several procedures, each producing multiple lesions in the left and right frontal lobes.|$|E

50|$|Some dogs can free {{themselves}} from prong collars with large <b>wire</b> <b>looped</b> sides by shaking their {{head so that}} the links pop out, so some trainers have come to use a second collar (usually an oversize check chain) {{in addition to the}} prong collar so if this happens the dog does not run loose.|$|R

5000|$|When {{the flux}} changes—because [...] changes, {{or because the}} <b>wire</b> <b>loop</b> is moved or deformed, or both—Faradays law of {{induction}} says that the <b>wire</b> <b>loop</b> acquires an EMF, , defined as the energy available from a unit charge that has travelled once around the <b>wire</b> <b>loop.</b> Equivalently, it is the voltage that would be measured by cutting the wire to create an open circuit, and attaching a voltmeter to the leads.|$|E
