5|$|As vice president, Brundage {{served on}} a {{commission}} appointed at the IOC's London session in 1948 to recommend whether the 1906 Intercalated Games, held in Athens, {{should be considered a}} full Olympic Games. All three members of what {{came to be known as}} the Brundage Commission were from the Western Hemisphere and met in New Orleans in January 1949. The commission found that there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> be gained by recognizing the 1906 games as Olympic, and it might set an embarrassing precedent. The full IOC endorsed the report when it met later that year in Rome.|$|E
5|$|Cutthroat {{competition}} <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> {{what was}} to follow. The 1890s were a tough time for the Romanian economy, and {{a rising tide of}} anti-Semitism made it an even tougher time for the Jews. One quarter of the Jewish population emigrated, with intellectuals particularly likely to leave, and those intellectuals who remained were more interested in politics than in theater: this was a period of social ferment, with Jewish socialists in Iaşi starting Der Veker (The Awakener).|$|E
5|$|Johnston {{protested that}} the British {{government}} {{could not take}} part in the kind of judicial enquiry Smith described, as its sovereignty could not be subject to any outside judgement and there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> arbitrate anyway. Smith was again resolute: why, he queried, was Whitehall so adamant to avoid legal arbitration if its ministers were so sure they were right? He promised to drop the matter if such a panel ruled against him, but to no avail. Johnston said only that he would telegraph Whitehall to inform them that Reedman's appointment was imminent. Dupont confirmed it that afternoon, telling the Rhodesian Legislative Assembly that the mission had been accepted by Portugal.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{service was}} operated by trains composed of an engine and three carriages. Thirty-two passengers could be accommodated in each carriage, which had longitudinal bench seating and sliding {{doors at the}} ends, leading onto a platform for boarding and alighting. It was reasoned that there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> look at in the tunnels, so the only windows were in a narrow band {{high up in the}} carriage sides. Gate-men rode on the carriage platforms to operate the lattice gates and announce the station names to the passengers. Because of their claustrophobic interiors, the carriages soon became known as padded cells. Unlike other railways, the C had no ticket classes or paper tickets; when the railway began operations, a flat fare of two pence, collected at a turnstile, was charged. Despite the cramped carriages and competition from bus and tram services, the railway attracted 5.1million passengers in 1891, its first year of operation. To alleviate overcrowding, the fleet of rolling stock was enlarged.|$|E
5|$|There <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> link Murat or {{his friends}} to the disappearance, and Murat's arguido status was lifted on 21 July 2008 when the case was archived. In April 2008 he {{received}} £600,000 in out-of-court settlements for libel in what The Observer said was {{the largest number of}} separate libel actions brought in the UK by the same person in relation to one issue; his friends received £100,000 each. In July 2014, during Operation Grange, one of those friends was questioned again as a witness, this time by the Polícia Judiciária on behalf of Scotland Yard. In December that year Murat and his wife were questioned, also on behalf of Scotland Yard, along with eight others. In 2017 Murat's mother, Jenny Murat, added her voice to those who had witnessed suspicious events around 5A that night: she told the BBC that she had driven past apartment 5A that night, and had seen a young woman in a plum-coloured top behaving suspiciously just outside it, information she said she passed to the police at the time. She also said she had seen a small brown rental car speeding toward the apartment, driving the wrong way down a one-way street.|$|E
5|$|Wilson had a combative {{streak and}} {{sometimes}} initiated fights with opposing players and fans. On June 22, 1928, a near-riot {{broke out in}} the ninth inning at Wrigley Field against the St. Louis Cardinals when Wilson jumped into the box seats to attack a heckling fan. An estimated 5,000 spectators swarmed the field before police could separate the combatants and restore order. The fan sued Wilson for $20,000, but a jury ruled in his favor. The following year he took offense at a remark by Cincinnati Reds pitcher Ray Kolp, and – upon reaching first base after hitting a single – he charged into the Reds dugout, punching Kolp several times before they could be separated. Later that evening at the train station, Wilson exchanged words and blows with Cincinnati player Pete Donohue. In late 1929 he signed a contract to fight Art Shires of the Chicago White Sox in a boxing match, but reneged after Cubs president William Veeck, Sr. enlisted Hack's wife Virginia to dissuade him, and then Shires lost a fight to George Trafton of the Chicago Bears. There <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> gain, Wilson said, by fighting a defeated boxer.|$|E

5|$|Finding her mother's body, Buffy {{at first}} denies what she sees, {{to the point}} of imagining {{alternate}} realities. Whedon stated that these mini dream sequences were like documentaries; people who find their loved ones dead are desperate to imagine a different, better outcome, and they create fantasies that cause much more pain when they are forced to return to the harshness of reality. Later in the hospital, Buffy imagines what she {{might have been able to}} do to save Joyce, although the doctor tells her there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> be done. Willow and Xander express anger and helplessness. Anya, new to mortality and human connections, is childlike in her innocence and questions. Xander's anger and Anya's confusion allow them to be mothered somewhat by Willow, who needs to take care of someone. Dawn is deeply in denial, unable to understand that the woman she thought she had known all her life was gone. Tara, who has gone through the ordeal before, represents the acceptance phase, soothing and helping the others to work through what they are experiencing. Buffy toward the end also begins to see acceptance when she tells Dawn that the body in the morgue is not their mother; Joyce is gone.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1812, Russia and the Ottoman Empire {{signed the}} Treaty of Bucharest, {{bringing}} the Russo-Ottoman War to a close. For his efforts, Karađorđe received the Order of Saint Anna from the Russians. The Governing Council scrambled {{to take an}} oath of loyalty to Russia in the hope that this would garner them further protection, to no avail. The Russian Emperor, Alexander, was aware of Napoleon's plans to invade Russia and desperately sought to return as many Russian soldiers as possible in order to repel the attack. As part of the Treaty of Bucharest, the Russians and Ottomans agreed that Serbian fortifications built after 1804 were to be destroyed, while cities and forts from which the Ottomans had been expelled {{over the course of the}} uprising were to be reoccupied and garrisoned by Ottoman troops. In exchange, the Ottomans agreed to declare a general amnesty for former rebels, as well as to grant the Serbs of the Pashalik of Belgrade some degree of autonomy. As part of the agreement, the Russians agreed to withdraw their forces from Serbia, as well as from Wallachia and Moldavia. The Russians encouraged Karađorđe and his followers to negotiate directly with the Porte regarding the minutiae of the handover of cities and fortifications to the Ottomans. Trepidation filled the rebel camp once it became clear that there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> prevent the Ottomans from exacting reprisals against the Pashalik's Serb population after the Russians withdrew. Karađorđe thus refused to abide by the terms of the Treaty of Bucharest and fighting continued.|$|E

25|$|County Sheriff Jim Clark {{had issued}} {{an order for}} all white males in Dallas County {{over the age of}} twenty-one to report to the {{courthouse}} that morning to be deputized. Commanding officer John Cloud told the demonstrators to disband at once and go home. Rev. Hosea Williams tried to speak to the officer, but Cloud curtly informed him there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> discuss. Seconds later, the troopers began shoving the demonstrators, knocking many to the ground and beating them with nightsticks. Another detachment of troopers fired tear gas, and mounted troopers charged the crowd on horseback.|$|E

25|$|In the 11th century, {{there were}} three conquests and some Anglo-Saxon people would live through it: one in the {{aftermath}} of the conquest of Cnut in 1016; the second after the unsuccessful attempt of battle of Stamford Bridge in 1066; the third after that of William of Normandy in 1066. The consequences of each conquest can only be assessed with hindsight. In 1016, no-one was to know that whatever cultural ramifications were felt then, they would be subsumed half a century later; and in 1066 there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> predict that the effects of William's conquest would be any greater or more lasting than those of Cnut's.|$|E
25|$|According to Thomas Powers, {{the author}} of Diana: The Making of a Terrorist, the more Oughton learned about the hard life of rural Guatemala, the more she {{reflected}} on the affluence of the United States. In Chichicastenango, Americans seemed an alien presence; the fact of their wealth was almost {{an insult to the}} impoverished Indians. In her mind, confusion emerged that lasted the rest of her life: she had rejected affluence (at first almost unconsciously) to work among the poor, but poverty, clearly, <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> be envied. She hated poverty, but she hated affluence, too. Oughton left Chichicastenango with a new view of the problems that undeveloped countries like Guatemala faced when in struggle with the United States.|$|E
25|$|Then Åke {{talked to}} the Swedish king, {{who was in a}} bad mood. Åke gave him {{valuable}} gifts and followed the king on the road until they came to the woods. Erik asked Åke why he, who was his man, had made such a difference between him and the Norwegian king. Åke answered that there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> blame Erik for but that he had got the old things and the old hall because he was old whereas the Norwegian king was in the bloom of his youth. Åke also answered that he was no less the Swedish king's man than the Swedish king was his man. Hearing the words of treason, Erik had no other choice but to slay the impudent and treacherous Åke.|$|E

25|$|Vincent's {{remains were}} too badly {{decomposed}} {{to conduct a}} full post-mortem, {{and she had to}} be identified from dental records. Police ruled death by natural causes as there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> suggest foul play: the front door was double locked and {{there was no sign of}} a break-in. At the time of her death she had a boyfriend, but the police were unable to trace him. Her sisters had hired a private detective to look for her and contacted the Salvation Army, but these attempts proved unsuccessful. The detective found the house where Vincent was living, and the family wrote letters to her. But as she was already dead by this time, they received no response, and the family assumed that she had deliberately broken ties with them.|$|E
25|$|An inquest {{into the}} deaths of the six men was opened in March 2006 in Oxfordshire. The inquest heard {{evidence}} that they men were only issued with 50 rounds each for their SA-80 rifles and that no satellite phone was allocated to them, although 37 units were available and there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> prevent the Red Caps from signing one out. The inquest heard detailed reports into the men's injuries {{at the hands of the}} mob with multiple gunshot wounds to hands, legs arms and faces. Relatives at the inquest demanded an apology from Dr Nicholas Hunt, the government appointed pathologist, as he had used photographs of the dead men in a seminar in how to set up temporary mortuaries in disaster zones without permission from the families.|$|E
25|$|In Week 2, {{the team}} {{traveled}} to St. Louis where they lost 24-22. A major defensive loss was suffered when Brian Orakpo went {{down from a}} tear to his left pectoral muscle. Despite widespread complaints from Redskins fans and players about the Rams playing dirty, there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> do but {{move on to the}} home opener against Cincinnati. The game started on a bad omen when the Bengals threw a 76-yard TD pass on the opening drive. Although the Redskins responded furiously and played another close match, they lost and injuries continued to pile up as CB Josh Wilson and WR Pierre Garçon went down. They would win their next game on a late game field goal at Tampa Bay, 24-22, after the Buccaneers made a 4th quarter comeback to take the lead. The Redskins only won one of their next five games, going into the bye week at 3-6.|$|E
