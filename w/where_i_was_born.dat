500|$|Vargas Llosa has mainly {{lived in}} Madrid since the 1990s, but spends roughly {{three months of}} the year in Peru with his {{extended}} family. He also frequently visits London where he occasionally spends long periods. Vargas Llosa acquired Spanish citizenship in 1993, though he still holds Peruvian nationality. The writer often reiterates his love for both countries. In his Nobel speech he observed: [...] "I carry Peru deep inside me because that is <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>born,</b> grew up, was formed, and lived those experiences of childhood and youth that shaped my personality and forged my calling". He then added: [...] "I love Spain as much as Peru, and my debt to her is as great as my gratitude. If not for Spain, I never would have reached this podium or become a known writer".|$|E

2500|$|He sailed for India on 20 September 1882, {{and arrived}} in Bombay on 18 October. He {{described}} this moment years later: [...] "So, at sixteen years and nine months, but looking {{four or five}} years older, and adorned with real whiskers which the scandalised Mother abolished within one hour of beholding, I found myself at Bombay <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>born,</b> moving among sights and smells that made me deliver in the vernacular sentences whose meaning I knew not. Other Indian-born boys have told me how the same thing happened to them." [...] This arrival changed Kipling, as he explains: [...] "There were yet three or four days’ rail to Lahore, where my people lived. After these, my English years fell away, nor ever, I think, came back in full strength".|$|E
2500|$|During {{his time}} in Romania, the {{scientist}} was involved in cultural debates surrounding the Romanian ethos. As a disciple of Moses Gaster and contributor to Anuar pentru Israeliți, Șăineanu implicitly stood for a Haskalah ideology, supporting Jewish integration into the cultural mainstream, and favored the scientific approach to Jewish history akin to the Wissenschaft des Judentums methods. Laszlo Alexandru refers to his [...] "fundamental program" [...] as being [...] "the assimilationist thesis", and explains that, for this reason, the scholar changed Schein to Șăineanu. The same commentator notes that Șăineanu disregarded Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu's publicized antisemitism {{when he became a}} [...] "fervent disciple" [...] of Hasdeu in scholarly matters. In reference to his own patriotic sentiment, Șăineanu once defined the country as [...] "twice sacred to my eyes—the land <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>born</b> and where my parents sleep their eternal slumber." [...] After his departure to France, he further stated that he bore [...] "not even the shadow of a grudge" [...] on the Romanian people as a whole. According to literary historian Eugen Lovinescu, the scholar's subsequent correspondence stands as [...] "proof of sincere adherence, prolonged over decades and perils, to his country of origin". However, according to one account, when Șăineanu happened to meet Nicolae Iorga in Paris some decades after their polemic, he made a point of addressing him in French, which was interpreted as a statement of disgust with the Romanian cultural environment.|$|E

I asked the attendant {{if he had been}} present while she was in the room. Yes; he had remained at his post; he had also heard the allusion to the place with the odd name. Had Mr. Gracedieu said anything more about that place? Nothing more; the poor Minister's mind had wandered off to other things. He was wandering now. Sometimes, he was addressing his congregation; sometimes, he wondered what they would give him for supper; sometimes, he talked of the flowers in the garden. And then he looked at me, and frowned, and said I prevented him from thinking.|$|R
50|$|As a {{descendant}} of the Gage family who went to England in 1066 with William the Conqueror {{at the time of}} the Norman Conquest, his great-great-great-great-grandfather, John Gage of Ipswich was the first of the Gage family to migrate to the New World as one of the first proprietors of Ipswich, Massachusetts in the summer of 1630. They then migrated to Salem, <b>where</b> Daniel Gage <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>born</b> in 1639, and then to Bradford, where in the early 18th century Daniel Gage II established the Gage's Ferry on the banks of the Merrimack River.|$|R

By the age of 15, he had decided that he wished to prepare for college, and he was then sent, accordingly, to Phillips Academy, Andover. He graduated from Yale College in 1830.|$|R

50|$|The city {{came from}} a village of Purí Indians {{in the year of}} 1800. The village grew up around a chapel built by Indians and slaves under the {{leadership}} of father Francisco das Chagas Lima, who was sent to evangelize the Purí people, where he stands today is the Mother Church. The city was incorporated in 1876. The patron saint of Queluz is St. John the Baptist, and the name Queluz is a tribute to the Imperial Family, sharing the name of the town <b>where</b> D.

5000|$|Dupain's {{documentary}} work of {{this period}} is exemplified in his photograph [...] "Meat Queue". He used a more naturalistic style of photography, [...] "capturing a moment of everyday interaction than attempting any social comment". [...] Dupain also worked extensively for the University of New South Wales and CSR Limited and made many trips to the interior and coast of northern Australia. However, apart from his war service he rarely left Australia, the first time not until 1978, when he was 67, and even then it was to photograph the new Australian Embassy in Paris, designed by his longtime friend and associate Harry Seidler. He wrote, [...] "I find that my whole life, if {{it is going to}} be of any consequence in photography, has to be devoted to that place <b>where</b> <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>born,</b> reared and worked, thought, philosophised and made pictures to the best of my ability. And that's all I need". In the 1950s the advent of the new consumerism meant that there was plenty of promotional photography for advertising and he attracted clients from magazines, advertising agencies and industrial firms. In between this he devoted time to pursue his love of architecture, and began architectural photography, which he continued most of his life.|$|R
60|$|I {{recall the}} time when I lived on a vast vacant level green plain, an earth which to the eye, and to the mind which sees with the eye, {{appeared}} illimitable, like the ocean; <b>where</b> the house <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>born</b> in <b>was</b> the oldest in the district--a century old, it was said; where the people were the children's children of emigrants from Europe who had conquered and colonized the country, and had enjoyed but {{half a century of}} national life. But the people who had possessed the land before these emigrants--what of them? They, were but a memory, a tradition, a story told in books and hardly more to us than a fable; perhaps they had dwelt there for long centuries, or for thousands of years; perhaps they had come, a wandering horde, to pass quickly away like a flight of migrating locusts; for no memorial existed, no work of their hands, not the faintest trace of their occupancy.|$|R

6000|$|And now, indeed, I {{knew what}} London {{had been to}} me, London <b>where</b> <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> <b>born</b> and educated, the slovenly mother of my mind and all my ambitions, London and the empire! It seemed to me we must be going out to a world that was utterly empty. All our {{significance}} fell from us--and before us was no meaning any more. We were leaving London; my hand, which had gripped so hungrily upon its complex life, had been forced from it, my fingers left their hold. That <b>was</b> over. <b>I</b> should never {{have a voice in}} public affairs again. The inexorable unwritten law which forbids overt scandal sentenced me. We were going out to a new life, a life that appeared in that moment to be a mere shrivelled remnant of me, a mere residuum of sheltering and feeding and seeing amidst alien scenery and the sound of unfamiliar tongues. We were going to live cheaply in a foreign place, so cut off that I meet now the merest stray tourist, the commonest tweed-clad stranger with a mixture of shyness and hunger.... And suddenly all the schemes <b>I</b> <b>was</b> leaving appeared fine and adventurous and hopeful as they had never done before. How great <b>was</b> this purpose <b>I</b> had relinquished, this bold and subtle remaking of the English will! I had doubted so many things, and now suddenly I doubted my unimportance, doubted my right to this suicidal abandonment. Was I not a trusted messenger, greatly trusted and favoured, who had turned aside by the way? Had I not, after all, stood for far more than <b>I</b> had thought; <b>was</b> <b>I</b> not filching from that dear great city of my birth and life, some vitally necessary thing, a key, a link, a reconciling clue in her political development, that now she might seek vaguely for in vain? What is one life against the State? Ought I not to have sacrificed Isabel and all my passion and sorrow for Isabel, and held to my thing--stuck to my thing? ...|$|R
