40|$|The {{equations}} of {{the ultimate}} strength for a column with <b>wing</b> <b>walls</b> in both sides which have been generally used, are not always estimated with accuracy, {{as compared to the}} ultimate strength for rectangular columns, because of the complicated section of the column. Moreover, those equations have been applied to columns with <b>wing</b> <b>wall</b> in one side. The sections of the columns with <b>wing</b> <b>walls</b> in both sides are symmetric, whereas those columns with in one side are unsymmetric. Accordingly, it is assumed that these two types of columns are different in failure patterns and deformation behaviors. The object {{of this paper is to}} investigate the strength and deformation behaviors of the four types of concrete columns with <b>wing</b> <b>wall</b> in one side, and to present a satisfactory equation {{of the ultimate}} strength for the columns wkth <b>wing</b> <b>wall</b> in one side. ...|$|R
40|$|Larger window {{openings}} in {{the walls of a}} building may provide better natural ventilation. However, it also increases the penetration of direct solar radiation into indoor environment. The use of <b>wing</b> <b>wall,</b> one of the green features, is an alternative to create effective natural ventilation. Givoni conducted experiments in a wind tunnel to study the ventilation performance of <b>wing</b> <b>walls.</b> This paper presents a numerical study of the ventilation performance of <b>wing</b> <b>walls</b> using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Two-dimensional and three-dimensional simulations are compared with the results of the experiments of Givoni. The results indicate that <b>wing</b> <b>wall</b> can promote natural ventilation by increasing the air change per hour and the mean indoor air speed relative to wind speed at various wind speeds and wind directions. The best performance of <b>wing</b> <b>wall</b> is at the wind angle of around 45 °. The study also shows that 3 D CFD simulation produces similar trend to the experimental results though there are some discrepancies. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R

25|$|On {{the stone}} wall, (in {{the same way}} as Milecastles,) {{additional}} structures known as Wing Walls were incorporated on the east and west side, allowing bonding to the curtain wall. This is interpreted as evidence that turrets (and milecastles) were constructed before the curtain wall. Where turrets were built with the intention of bonding to a broad gauge curtain wall, they were given broad <b>wing</b> <b>walls.</b> However, there are many cases where the curtain wall actually constructed was of narrow gauge, giving a point of reduction where the curtain <b>wall</b> and turret <b>wing</b> <b>walls</b> join. To facilitate bonding with the curtain <b>wall,</b> <b>wing</b> <b>walls</b> were constructed longer at the base, and stepping inwards as they were built upwards. Turrets thought to have been constructed later in the plan were built with much shorter <b>wing</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|R

Here, we detail the wind tunnel testing and numerical set-up used for obtaining the data on ventilation rates and indoor airflow distribution inside a test room with a two-sided windcatcher and <b>wing</b> <b>wall.</b> Three models were integrated with <b>wing</b> <b>wall</b> angled at 30 °, 45 ° and 60 ° and another windcatcher was a conventional two-sided device.

40|$|Four {{specimens}} {{were tested}} representing reinforced concrete column with a <b>wing</b> <b>wall</b> to investigate seismic performance of members with an irregular section. The specimens were one-half scale columns {{combined with a}} <b>wing</b> <b>wall</b> only on one side in the loading direction. The section and reinforcement details were planned following the previous tests on columns with <b>wing</b> <b>walls</b> on both sides. The effects of asymmetric horizontal section, reinforcement details and varying axial force on seismic performance were investigated. The ultimate strengths of the members were identified with the observed failure modes. The measured flexural and shear strengths were compared with the calculated strengths based on the conventional design formula {{as well as new}} formula in practice proposed by the authors with the results of the first test series. Application of these members is also shown for design of “hyper-earthquake resistant system,” by which damages could be minor insensitive to possible extreme motions...|$|R
40|$|In buildings, 60 % of {{the energy}} {{consumption}} is associated to Heating, Ventilation and Air-conditioning (HVAC) systems. One solution to reduce this share is the application of natural ventilation systems. Windcatcher and <b>wing</b> <b>wall</b> are two well-known techniques for natural ventilation which {{have been used in}} different regions. Nevertheless, in areas with low wind speed such as the tropical climate of Malaysia there is hesitation for application of natural ventilation systems. The integration of windcatcher with <b>wing</b> <b>wall</b> can potentially enhance the ventilation performance. However, this configuration was not looked into by pervious investigations thus, this study aims to address this research gap by first evaluating the effect of <b>wing</b> <b>wall</b> with various angles on the ventilation performance and second compare the performance of this new design with a conventional windcatcher. This research used two main investigative steps: experimental scaled wind tunnel testing and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation. Four reduced-scale models of two-sided windcatcher were tested in a low speed wind tunnel. Three models were integrated with <b>wing</b> <b>wall</b> in 30 °, 45 ° and 60 ° incident angles and another windcatcher was a conventional two-sided windcatcher, which is typical in regions with predominant wind direction. The CFD validation against experiment showed good agreement. The best operation was observed in the windcatcher with 30 ° <b>wing</b> <b>wall</b> angle which could supply 910 l/s fresh air into the room in 2. 5 m/s wind speed. Hence, the new design had 50 % more ventilation performance comparing with conventional two-sided windcatcher in the same external wind speed. Finally, it was concluded that the new design satisfied requirements of ASHRAE 62. 1...|$|R
