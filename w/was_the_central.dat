5|$|Ellie {{was created}} by Neil Druckmann, the {{creative}} director and writer of The Last of Us. Inspired by a mute character proposed for , Druckmann created her as a strong female character with {{a close relationship with}} Joel; throughout the game's development, the relationship between Ellie and Joel <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>central</b> focus, with all other elements developed around it. Johnson inspired aspects of Ellie's personality, prompting Druckmann to make her more active in fighting hostile enemies. Naughty Dog also redesigned her appearance during the game's development to more closely resemble Johnson. Her appearance has also been compared to that of actress Ellen Page.|$|E
5|$|Jinnah <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>central</b> {{figure of}} the 1998 film Jinnah, {{which was based on}} Jinnah's life and his {{struggle}} for the creation of Pakistan. Christopher Lee, who portrayed Jinnah, called his performance the best of his career. The 1954 Hector Bolitho's book Jinnah: Creator of Pakistan prompted Fatima Jinnah to release a book, titled My Brother (1987), as she thought that Bolitho's book had failed to express the political aspects of Jinnah. The book received positive reception in Pakistan. Jinnah of Pakistan (1984) by Stanley Wolpert is {{regarded as one of the}} best biographical books on Jinnah.|$|E
5|$|Modifications and {{expansions}} {{on several}} traditional royal rituals under Andrianampoinimerina {{enabled him to}} develop a state religion in which he <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>central</b> figure. The tradition of the fandroana festival established by the 17th century Merina king Ralambo was made a much larger event intended to symbolically renew {{the nation and the}} cosmic power that legitimized and strengthened Andrianampoinimerina's reign as well as the power of the state. This served to further unify his citizens while legitimizing and strengthening his rule.|$|E

5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{question the}} poet's sexuality, theorizing that the numerous letters and poems that were dedicated to Susan Gilbert Dickinson indicate a lesbian romance, and speculating {{about how this}} may have influenced her poetry. Critics such as John Cody, Lillian Faderman, Vivian R. Pollak, Paula Bennett, Judith Farr, Ellen Louise Hart, and Martha Nell Smith have argued that Susan <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>central</b> erotic relationship in Dickinson's life.|$|E
5|$|The Transitional Programme <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>central</b> {{programmatic}} {{statement of}} the congress, summarising its strategic and tactical conceptions for the revolutionary period that it saw opening up {{as a result of}} the war which Trotsky had been predicting for some years. It is not, however, the definitive programme of the Fourth International as is often suggested but instead contains a summation of the conjunctural understanding of the movement at that date and a series of transitional policies designed to develop the struggle for workers' power.|$|E
5|$|Though Ellie was {{initially}} {{intended to be}} Joel's daughter, the team found this to be too limiting in terms of further character development. The team chose Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson to portray Joel and Ellie, respectively. Providing both the voice and motion capture of the characters, Baker and Johnson assisted the team to develop the characters and help refine the story. The relationship between Joel and Ellie <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>central</b> focus of the game, and all other elements were developed around it. Various other characters were influenced by the story progression, ultimately becoming completely different from the initial vision.|$|E

5|$|Alcatraz cellhouse had a {{corridor}} naming system named after major American streets and landmarks. Michigan Avenue was {{the corridor to}} the side of A-Block, and Broadway <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>central</b> corridor in which the inmates would assemble as they massed through Times Square (an area with a clock on the wall), before entering the dining hall for their meals. Broadway separated Block-B and Block-C and prisoners kept along it had the least privacy in the prison. The corridor between Block-C and the library was called Park Avenue. The corridor in D-Block was named Sunset Strip. Gun galleries lay {{at the end of each}} block, including the West and East Gun Galleries.|$|E
5|$|Among Presbyterians, communion <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>central</b> {{occasion}} of the church, conducted infrequently, at most once a year, often taking a week of festivals {{as part of a}} communion season. Communicants were examined by a minister and elders, proving their knowledge of the Shorter Catechism. They were then given communion tokens that entitled them {{to take part in the}} ceremony. Long tables were set up in the middle of the church at which communicants sat to receive communion. Where ministers refused or neglected parish communion, largely assemblies were carried out in the open air, often combining several parishes. These large gatherings were discouraged by the General Assembly, but continued. They could become mixed with secular activities and were commemorated as such by Robert Burns in the poem Holy Fair. They could also be occasions for evangelical meetings, as at the Cambuslang Wark.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1650s, Parchevich {{had entered}} major European {{politics}} and <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>central</b> {{figure of a}} significant anti-Ottoman plot. In 1656, Parchevich arranged a meeting in Târgovişte between {{the members of the}} plot, which included the rulers of Moldavia and Wallachia and high-ranking clerics, including the Serbian Patriarch. After the meeting, Parchevich sent revolutionary messages to Bulgaria, Serbia, Albania and Greece, hoping to incite a rebellion. His plans were backed by the rulers of the Romanian lands which border Bulgaria north of the Danube: Gheorghe Ştefan of Moldavia and Constantin Şerban of Wallachia. However, the lack of clear support by key accomplice Austria meant an eventual uprising had to be delayed. In 1657, Parchevich was received by Cossack hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky, whom he visited on a special mission. In the same year, he was granted the noble title of baron by the Habsburgs owing to his merits in defending Christianity. As an Austrian noble, he was styled Peter Freiherr von Parchevich.|$|E

5|$|Model's {{main attack}} was {{delivered}} by XLVII Panzer Corps, supported by 45 Tigers of the attached 505th Heavy Tank Battalion. Covering their left flank was XLI Panzer Corps, with an attached regiment of 83 Ferdinand tank destroyers. On the right flank, XLVI Panzer Corps consisted {{at this time}} of four infantry divisions with just 9 tanks and 31 assault guns. To the left of XLI Panzer Corps was XXIII Army Corps, which consisted of the reinforced 78th Assault Infantry Division and two regular infantry divisions. While the corps contained no tanks, it did have 62 assault guns. Opposing the 9th Army <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>Central</b> Front, deployed in three heavily fortified defensive belts.|$|E
5|$|Paris <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>central</b> hub {{of culture}} and {{economic}} activity, and as such, the most highly skilled culinary craftsmen were to be found there. Markets in Paris such as Les Halles, la Mégisserie, those found along Rue Mouffetard, and similar smaller versions in other cities were {{very important to the}} distribution of food. Those that gave French produce its characteristic identity were regulated by the guild system, which developed in the Middle Ages. In Paris, the guilds were regulated by city government {{as well as by the}} French crown. A guild restricted those in a given branch of the culinary industry to operate only within that field.|$|E
5|$|The Kirk had {{considerable}} {{control over the}} lives of the people, with {{a major role in the}} Poor Law and schools and over the morals of the population. Strict Sabbatarianism was vital to Presbyterianism. The sermon was seen as central and the only participation by the congregation the singing of the psalms. Communion <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>central</b> occasion of the church, conducted infrequently, at most once a year, often taking a week of festivals as part of a communion season. In the second half of the century there were a series of reforms of church music connected to a choir movement. Episcopalians installed organs and hired musicians, following the practice in English parish churches. Catholic worship was deliberately low key, with musical accompaniment prohibited.|$|E

5|$|The Minister of Finance (Da sinong 大司農) {{was also}} called the Grand Minister of Agriculture, and before 144 BC, was known as Clerk of the Capital for Grain (Zhisu neishi 治粟內史). This {{minister}} <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>central</b> government's treasurer for the official bureaucracy and the armed forces. While the Chancellor drafted the state budget, the Minister of Finance was responsible for funding it. He {{was in charge of}} storing the poll taxes, which were gathered in coin cash, and land tax, which was gathered as a proportion of farmers' annual crop yields. He was also responsible for setting the standards for units of measurement. In addition to reviewing tax collections, he could implement policies for price control exacted on certain commercial commodities.|$|E
5|$|The aphid that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>central</b> {{source of}} the damage in France was first noted {{following}} the growing of the European vine Vitis vinifera by French colonists in Florida, in the 16th century. These plantations were a failure, and later experiments with related species of vine also failed, although the reason for these failures {{appears to have been}} a mystery to the French colonists. It is known today that it was a species of North American grape phylloxera that caused these early vineyards to fail; the venom injected by the Phylloxera causes a disease that is quickly fatal to the European varieties of vine. The aphids initially went unnoticed by the colonists, despite their great numbers, and the pressure to successfully start a vineyard in America at the time.|$|E
5|$|The {{church was}} not the regular place of worship of laypeople until the Reformation. It was {{reserved}} for official services of the Catholic Church hierarchy (by the cathedral's canons). The parish churches in Uppsala were the Holy Trinity Church or Bondkyrkan, ‘Peasant Church’, as it was often called; Church of Saint Peter; Church of Our Lady; and a Franciscan friary. The last three had been built {{on the east side}} of the Fyris River, which <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>central</b> business district, and remains so to date. They were successively torn down during the Reformation. The Cathedral was also the coronation church for many of Sweden's kings and queens until 1719. It was the site of celebrating coronations from the Middle Ages until the end of the 17th century. Stockholm's Cathedral Storkyrkan became the official coronation church.|$|E

5|$|The {{relationship}} between Joel and Ellie <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>central</b> {{focus of the}} game; all other elements were developed around it. Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson were cast as Joel and Ellie, respectively, and provided voice and motion capture performances. Baker and Johnson contributed {{to the development of}} the characters; for example, Baker convinced Druckmann that Joel would care for Tess due to his loneliness, and Johnson convinced Druckmann that Ellie should be stronger and more defensive. Ellie's physical appearance was also redesigned throughout development to make her look more similar to Johnson. The game's other characters also underwent changes. The character Tess was originally intended to be the main antagonist of The Last of Us, but the team found it difficult to believe her motives. The sexuality of the character Bill was originally left vague in the script, but later altered to further reflect his homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|The team's next {{challenge}} <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>Central</b> Michigan Chippewas, which Temple Owls handled 65–53. The Owls {{were losing}} 31–41 with 16:35 {{left in the}} game, but then scored the next eight points. Temple Owls permanently took the lead off a Lavoy Allen layup with 9:30 remaining. Juan Fernandez notched 18 points led the Owls, and Allen had a double-double of 13 points and 10 rebounds. In the teams' first meeting since 2006, Temple Owls knocked off Maryland 63–61. Despite trailing by 15 at halftime, Maryland staged a comeback led by Terrell Stoglin, who had 12 of his 16 {{points in the second}} half. James Padgett dunked with 1:49 left to tie the game at 56. Afterwards, Lavoy Allen completed a three-point play, and Khalif Wyatt stole a Dino Gregory pass to put Temple Owls in the lead permanently. The Owls outrebounded the Terrapins 42–32, and Ramone Moore scored 16 points, leading the team.|$|E
5|$|Zion Cinema <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>central</b> {{landmark}} of Zion Square {{from the}} 1920s until its closure in 1972. Located {{on the south}} side of Zion Square, it was originally a 400-seat silent-movie hut and, after snowfall destroyed the structure, was rebuilt into a 600-seat theatre that staged plays, concerts, lectures, and films. In the 1920s and 1930s the Zion Cinema was the cultural center of Jerusalem. After its closure, the building was demolished and a high-rise containing the Kikar Zion Hotel and a branch of Bank HaPoalim was erected in its place. In 2013 the 117-room hotel was purchased by Orchid Hotel Management Ltd., which is renovating the property for reopening as the Herbert Samuel Hotel. The hotel will have 137 rooms and suites, and a kosher rooftop restaurant with a 360-degree panoramic view.|$|E
