5000|$|As a new {{generation}} of Roma intellectuals emerges, there is the birth of Roma consciousness, a state when successful, wealthy and well-educated Roma proudly acknowledge their origin, rather than opt for assimilation and the relinquishment of their cultural heritage. These newly emerged professionals (e.g. cultural anthropologist Ágnes Daróczi, politician Nicolae Gheorghe, political and cultural activist Jenő Zsigó, artist Tibor Balogh, curator and art historian Tímea Junghaus are rewriting the history of Roma culture, representation and art. If we draw on Stuart Hall’s analysis of minority cultural politics, we might suggest that in order to deconstruct dominant cultural representations, Roma artists need to fight on two fronts. First, they need to reverse the stereotypes that prevail in the media, by producing images of the Roma that oppose those created in mainstream culture. Secondly, they need to fight for access to mainstream audiences. Otherwise, even the rare examples of truly authentic self-representations remain visible only within the narrow circles of academia or human rights festivals. If, as leading Romani scholar-politician Nicolae Gheorghe suggests, [...] "the representation of Romani identity is a process of ethno-genesis which involves the Roma self-consciously playing with their identities, then perhaps <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> constructing effective representations involves the artist as much as the scientist or politician." ...|$|E

5000|$|On {{the issue}} at hand, Menikoff and Brock think that the {{importance}} of informed consent should put us on the “truth” side of the question. Menikoff writes: “Deceiving prospective organ donors about relevant truths concerning their condition is likely, ultimately, to lead to diminished public confidence and to fewer organ donations. But even if it did not reduce the number of donated organs, in a system that is allegedly based on freely given consent, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> obtaining such consent by telling less than the truth is fundamentally wrong.” [...] And Brock contends that in a democratic state there is a presumption that the citizens will be informed about all relevant information of public policy, and thinks that DCD involves such a radical change in the timing of death from what people ordinarily think, that it is something that they should be informed about. By contrast, the IOM took itself to have the task of addressing the question: “Given a potential donor in an end-of-life situation, what are the alternative medical approaches {{that can be used to}} maximize the availability of organs from that donor without violating prevailing ethical norms regarding the rights and welfare of donors?” And it replied: “Our goal was to support both the interests of patients and families regarding nature and time of death and the public's interests in increased organ procurement. In striking the balance, the expert panel strictly adhered to widely endorsed principles of ethics and established legal and legal guidelines.” [...] In thus balancing what is disclosed to the family against what is in the interest of organ procurement, the IOM comes down on the “consequences” side of the “truth or consequences” debate.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{criticism}} of the Security Council involves the veto power of the five permanent members. As it stands, a veto {{from any of the}} permanent members can halt any possible action the Council may take. One country's objection, rather than the opinions of a majority of countries, may cripple any possible UN armed or diplomatic response to a crisis.For instance, John J. Mearsheimer claimed that [...] "since 1982, the US has vetoed 32 Security Council resolutions critical of Israel, more than the total number of vetoes cast by all the other Security Council members." [...] Since candidates for the Security Council are proposed by regional blocs, the Arab League and its allies are usually included but Israel, which joined the UN in 1949, has never been elected to the Security Council. The Council has repeatedly condemned Israel. On the other hand, critics contend that, while Israel has the United States to rely on to veto any pertinent legislation against it, the Palestinians lack any such power. Apart from the US, several resolutions have been vetoed by Russia, notably attempts to impose sanctions on Syria during the Syrian Civil War and to condemn Russia's own annexation of Crimea in 2014. In the case of the latter, Russia's lone veto overruled the thirteen other votes in favor of the condemnation. As part of the Soviet Union, Russia also vetoed a UN resolution condemning the USSR's shooting down of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 in 1983. The veto has been singled out as a threat to human rights, with Amnesty International claiming that the five permanent members had used their veto to [...] "promote their political self interest or geopolitical interest above the interest of protecting civilians." [...] As of 2014, Amnesty International has suggested that a solution would involve the five permanent members surrendering their veto on issues of genocide. Some see the fact that veto power is exclusive to the permanent five as being anachronistic and unjust, given that the United Nations is meant to equally represent all its member states. Journalist Kourosh Ziabari has stated that the veto is [...] "a discriminatory and biased privilege given to five countries to dictate their own will to some 200 countries as they wish."

Theirs are problems of nature not of history: hunger, pestilence, violence are in the natural order of things (Galeano 2001, 1). The essence of violence in Latin America has shifted from a socio-political question to one which is now socio-economic in nature. According to Rodgers (2004, 1)), “the most visible forms of violence stem not from ideological conflicts over the nature of the political system but from delinquency and crime” (p. 1). While the violence that plagues the region is nothing new, the levels of violence have increased so dramatically over the past decade that some Latin Americanists <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> the current wave of violence steaming from crime and delinquency presents Latin American states with serious challenges to economic and social development programs in the twenty-first century.

Like others before him Goldspink advocates the use of bottom-up computer simulations (BUCSs) for examining social phenomena. It is argued therein that computer simulation offers a partial solution to the methodological crisis apparently observed in the social sciences. Though I agree with many of Goldspink’s remarks I personally feel that BUCS has been oversold {{as a tool for}} modeling and managing organizational complexity {{at the expense of other}} equally legitimate (from a complex systems stance) approaches.

The aim of this short note is to discuss some of the limitations in more detail and suggest that complexity thinking offers a simulation paradigm that is broader than the new reductionism of BUCS.

Yet despite this agreement evidence from myriad sources indicate that most Americans reject this grand-unifying theory of the life sciences. Although the reasons for this rejection are both numerous and complex they are undoubtedly related to American pedagogical failures and the persistence of alternative views based on faith. It appears misconceptions of evolutionary theory can be divided into two major categories: 1) epistemological misconceptions [...] those dealing with the nature of scientific inquiry; and 2) content misconceptions [...] those dealing with the process and mechanisms of evolution itself.

However, {{there are at least three}} significant challenges associated with measuring word of mouth. First, how does one gather the data? Because the information is exchanged in private conversations, direct observation traditionally has been difficult. Second, what aspect of these conversations should one measure? The third challenge comes from the fact that word of mouth is not exogenous. While the mapping from word of mouth to future sales is of great interest to the firm, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> also <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> word of mouth is an outcome of past sales. Our primary objective is to address these challenges. As a context for our study, we have chosen new television (TV) shows during the 1999 – 2000 seasons. Our source of word-of-mouth conversations is Usenet, a collection of thousands of newsgroups with diverse topics. We find that online conversations may offer an easy and cost-effective opportunity to measure word of mouth.
