5|$|Accompanying Azzimani to the Olympics, was a {{group of}} eight {{schoolchildren}} from Woippy, a suburb of the French city Metz. Azzimani had organised the trip for the children, who were from an area which saw rioting following the death of a man fleeing police in January 2010. He said in an interview prior to the games that the trip for the children <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> than his own, and related it to being introduced to being introduced to skiing on a school trip of his own at the age of six years old.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the events}} {{happening}} in Cuba at the time, Betances thought that his diplomatic work <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> than ever. However, his failing health (he had uremia, and since his lungs could not exchange oxygen properly this put extra burden {{to his heart}} and kidneys) prevented Betances from performing further diplomatic work from France on behalf of Puerto Rico or Cuba. His illness, which lasted more than a year, prevented him from performing medical work, and forced the Party to approve a stipend for Betances during his long illness, until his death.|$|E
50|$|Saraswati Sabatham {{is about}} {{the story of a}} dispute between three goddesses and who is the most {{powerful}} of them all. Narada (Sivaji Ganesan), a sage and celestial troublemaker, begins the argument by visiting Saraswati (Savitri), the Goddess of knowledge, and annoys Her on purpose by saying that wealth <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> and abundant. Angered by this, Saraswati states She will prove that knowledge <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>important.</b> Narada then goes to Vaikuntha to see Lakshmi (Devika), the Goddess of wealth, and says that knowledge <b>is</b> <b>more</b> abundant. Lakshmi also retorts She will prove that wealth <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>important.</b> Narada finally goes to Mount Kailash, seeking Parvati (Padmini), the goddess of strength, and annoys Her too by saying that wealth and knowledge <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>important.</b> Parvati too stresses that strength <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>important.</b>|$|R

5|$|In myth, {{the gods}} behave much like humans. They feel emotion; they can eat, drink, fight, weep, sicken, and die. Some have unique {{character}} traits. Set is aggressive and impulsive, and Thoth, patron {{of writing and}} knowledge, is prone to long-winded speeches. Yet overall, the gods are more like archetypes than well drawn characters. Their behavior is inconsistent, and their thoughts and motivations are rarely stated. Most myths about them lack highly developed characters and plots, because the symbolic meaning of the myths <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> than elaborate storytelling.|$|E
5|$|The left-wing preoccupations {{were also}} an {{important}} feature of Libertatea. Its opening manifesto called for a large-scale social reform, which it claimed <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> to Romanians than any National Liberal project to recover Transylvania from its Austro-Hungarian overlord. It enlisted contributions, generally less political than those at Seara, from literary figures such as Vinea, Demostene Botez, I. Dragoslav, Adrian Maniu and I. C. Vissarion.|$|E

5|$|Attitudes of the Russian {{space program}} and NASA towards Phase One were also {{of concern to}} the astronauts involved. Because of Russia's {{financial}} issues, many workers at the TsUP felt that the mission hardware and continuation of Mir <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> than {{the lives of the}} cosmonauts aboard the station. As such the program was run very differently compared to American programs: cosmonauts had their days being planned for them to the minute, actions (such as docking) which would be performed manually by shuttle pilots were all carried out automatically, and cosmonauts had their pay docked if they made any errors during their flights. Americans learned aboard Skylab and earlier space missions that this level of control was not productive and had since made mission plans more flexible. The Russians, however, would not budge, and many felt that significant work time was lost because of this.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1956 NBA draft, Auerbach {{had already}} {{set his sights}} on {{defensive}} rebounding center Bill Russell. Via a draft-day trade that sent Macauley and rookie Cliff Hagan to the rival St. Louis Hawks, he acquired a center in Russell, who would go on {{to become one of the}} greatest basketball players of all time. In the same draft, Auerbach picked up forward Tom Heinsohn and guard K.C. Jones, also two future Hall-of-Famers. Emphasizing team play rather than individual performances, and stressing that defense <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> than offense, Auerbach drilled his players to play tough defense and force opposing turnovers for easy fast-break points. Forward Tom Sanders recalled that the teams were also regularly among the best-conditioned and toughest squads.|$|E
5|$|Beilhart {{was born}} in Ohio {{and raised in the}} Lutheran faith. He moved to Kansas when he was 18 and embraced Seventh-day Adventism. He later {{attended}} college to become a licensed preacher. Eventually, Beilhart came to believe that it <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> to put faith into practice helping others so he left preaching to study nursing and work in a sanitarium. He returned to Ohio in 1899 to start the Spirit Fruit Society, an intentional community based on his experiences, learning, and views. Beilhart led the group for nine years before he died of appendicitis and peritonitis in 1908. Beilhart's commune survived for another 22 years {{making it one of the}} longest surviving communes in America.|$|E

5|$|Eureka was {{published}} in a small hardcover edition in March 1848 by Wiley & Putnam priced at 75 cents. Poe persuaded George Palmer Putnam, who had previously taken a chance on Poe by printing his only novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket in England, to publish Eureka after claiming this work <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> than Isaac Newton's discovery of gravity. Putnam paid Poe fourteen dollars for the work. Poe suggested an initial printing {{of at least one}} million copies; Putnam settled on 750, of which 500 were sold that year. Other accounts say that Poe requested 50,000 copies, and 500 were printed. Poe was given in advance the full payment of $14 from the publisher.|$|E
5|$|Fearing the {{approaching}} Jin army, Song emperor Huizong planned to retreat south. The emperor deserting the capital {{would have been}} viewed {{as an act of}} capitulation, so court officials convinced him to abdicate. There were few objections. Rescuing an empire in crisis from destruction <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> than preserving the rituals of imperial inheritance. In January 1126, {{a few days before the}} New Year, Huizong abdicated in favor of his son and was demoted to the ceremonial role of Retired Emperor. The Jurchen forces reached the Yellow River on January 27, 1126, two days after the New Year. Huizong fled Kaifeng the next day, escaping south and leaving the newly enthroned emperor Qinzong (r. 1126–1127) in charge of the capital.|$|E
5|$|Gray abhorred slavery. In his view, science {{proved the}} unity of all man because all human races can interbreed and produce fertile offspring, i.e., all members of a species are {{connected}} genetically. He also felt Christianity taught {{the unity of}} man. He was not an abolitionist, feeling it <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> to preserve the Union, yet he also felt if the South persevered in the conflict, every slave should be set free, by use of more force if necessary. However, {{he was not sure}} what should be done with the freed slaves. This was another area where Gray and Agassiz disagreed; Agassiz felt each race had different origins.|$|E

5|$|In 1981, a {{third major}} {{competitor}} joined {{the race for}} superheavy elements—the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (English: Society for Heavy Ion Research) in Darmstadt, Hesse, West Germany. They claimed to have synthesized the element 107; their report came out {{five years after the}} first report from Dubna did but provided a greater level of precision, making a more solid claim on discovery. The German team joined with the Soviet team in that it suggested the name nielsbohrium for the new element, believing Bohr did deserve an element named after him, and hoping to ease the tension on the element 105 controversy. The Soviet team did not hurry to suggest a new name for element 105, stating it <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> to first determine the discoverers of the element.|$|E
5|$|In {{foreign policy}} Red Finland leaned on Bolshevist Russia. A Finnish-Russian Red treaty and peace {{agreement}} was signed on 1 March 1918. The negotiations for the treaty revealed, that, as in World War I in general, nationalism <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> {{for both sides}} than the principles of international socialism. The Red Finns did not accept alliance with the Bolsheviks and major disputes appeared e.g. over demarcation of the border between Red Finland and Soviet Russia. The bargaining sides exchanged land areas; an artillery base, Ino, located in the Karelian Isthmus, was transferred to Russia, while Finland received Petsamo in north-eastern Lapland. The significance of the Russian-Finnish Treaty evaporated soon, due to {{the signing of the}} Treaty of Brest-Litovsk between the Bolsheviks and the German Empire on 3 March 1918.|$|E
5|$|Interest in the Declaration was revived in the 1790s {{with the}} {{emergence}} of the United States's first political parties. Throughout the 1780s, few Americans knew or cared who wrote the Declaration. But in the next decade, Jeffersonian Republicans sought political advantage over their rival Federalists by promoting both the importance of the Declaration and Jefferson as its author. Federalists responded by casting doubt on Jefferson's authorship or originality, and by emphasizing that independence was declared by the whole Congress, with Jefferson as just one member of the drafting committee. Federalists insisted that Congress's act of declaring independence, in which Federalist John Adams had played a major role, <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> than the document announcing it. But this view faded away, like the Federalist Party itself, and, before long, the act of declaring independence became synonymous with the document.|$|E

5|$|Talks {{began on}} 30 April 1634, and the Treaty of Polyanovka {{was signed in}} May, {{putting an end to}} hostilities. The treaty {{confirmed}} the pre-war status quo, with Russia paying a large war indemnity (20,000 rubles in gold), while Władysław agreed to surrender his claim to the Russian throne and return the royal insignia to Moscow. Jasienica notes that from the Russian perspective it was likely that Władysław's abnegation of his claim <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>important,</b> in terms of the subsequent increase in internal stability, than the loss of disputed borderland. Despite not winning militarily, the Russians may have scored a diplomatic triumph. Other authors, such as Hellie, support this interpretation.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. strike {{aircraft}} were running about 20 minutes behind the Japanese. Believing that a speedy attack <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> than a massed attack, {{and because they}} lacked fuel to spend time assembling prior to the strike, the U.S. aircraft proceeded in small groups towards the Japanese ships, rather than forming into a single large strike force. The first group—consisting of 15 Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers, six Grumman TBF-1 Avenger torpedo bombers, and eight Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters, led by Lieutenant Commander R. Eation from Hornet—was on its way by about 08:00. A second group—consisting of three SBDs, seven TBFs, and eight Wildcats from Enterprise—was off by 08:10. A third group—which included nine SBDs, eight TBFs, and seven F4Fs from Hornet—was on its way by 08:20.|$|E
5|$|During {{the initial}} period of German naval expansion, Britain {{did not feel}} {{particularly}} threatened. The Lords of the Admiralty felt {{the implications of the}} Second Naval Law were not a significantly more dangerous threat than the fleet set by the First Naval Law; they believed it <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> to focus on the practical situation rather than speculation on future programs that might easily be reduced or cut entirely. Segments of the British public, however, quickly seized on the perceived threat posed by the German construction programs. Despite their dismissive reaction, the Admiralty resolved to surpass German battleship construction. Admiral John Fisher, who became the First Sea Lord and head of the Admiralty in 1904, introduced sweeping reforms in large part to counter the growing threat posed by the expanding German fleet. Training programs were modernized, old and obsolete vessels were discarded, and the scattered squadrons of battleships were consolidated into four main fleets, three of which were based in Europe. Britain also made a series of diplomatic arrangements, including an alliance with Japan that allowed a greater concentration of British battleships in the North Sea.|$|E
