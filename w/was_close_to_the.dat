5|$|As is {{the case}} with many castles – {{especially}} of the 12th century – there is no record of how much it cost to build Buckton Castle. However, based on comparison to Peveril Castle in Derbyshire, where construction of the keep in 11751177 cost £184 according to the Pipe Rolls, it is estimated that the work at Buckton would have cost around £100. This <b>was</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> median annual income for a baron in 1200.|$|E

5|$|As {{the area}} boomed {{following}} {{the discovery of the}} Comstock Lode, the Bowers claim proved to hold one of the richest seams of silver ore in what would become Nevada, and because their claim <b>was</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surface, it was easily extracted without initial capital investment. The Bowers Mining Company quickly made Eilley and Sandy very wealthy.|$|E

5|$|Twelve Years a Slave (1853), bestselling {{narrative}} of free negro Solomon Northrup published soon after Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852), which documents facts supporting Stowe's fictional narrative in detail, {{as the area}} where Northrup was enslaved <b>was</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fictional setting of the plantation where much of Stowe's narrative takes place.|$|E
5|$|After {{becoming}} {{a tropical storm}} on August30, the subtropical ridge caused Leslie to turn west-northwestward. By the early on August31, the storm featured well-define outflow in all directions {{and the center of}} circulation <b>was</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> main area of convection. Intensity estimates around that time indicated sustained wind speeds of 70mph (110km/h). However, intensification halted later on August31 as wind shear increased over the storm, causing convection to become displaced from the center. Early on September1, an eye-like feature appeared on satellite imagery; however, there was uncertainty {{as to whether or not}} the feature was displaced from the low-level center. The storm became increasingly disorganized, with the circulation displaced from the main convective area several hours later.|$|E
5|$|After making further radial {{velocity}} measurements, a planet orbiting {{at a distance}} of around 5 AU was announced in 2002. This planet received the designation 55 Cancri d. At the time of discovery, the planet was thought to be in an orbit of mild eccentricity (close to 0.1), but this value was increased by later measurements. Even after accounting for these two planets, a periodicity at 43 days remained, possibly due to a third planet. Measurements of the star suggested that this <b>was</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> star's rotation period, which raised the possibility that the 43-day signal was caused by stellar activity. This possible planet received the designation 55 Cancri c.|$|E

5|$|As in {{his other}} films, von Stroheim used Christian imagery and symbols, such as crosses and churches. Trina first shows signs of greed on Easter Sunday and is murdered by McTeague on Christmas Eve. Christmas Eve was often {{depicted}} in von Stroheim's films and <b>was</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> date of his father's death. Lennig asserted that the character of McTeague's father (who was only briefly mentioned in the novel) is based on von Stroheim's own father, while McTeague's mother {{is a tribute to}} von Stroheim's mother, to whom Greed is dedicated. Von Stroheim stated that he considered all of his good qualities to have come from his mother and all of his bad qualities to have come from his father.|$|E
5|$|Cardiff Castle {{was built}} during this period. There are two {{possible}} dates for the construction: William the Conqueror may {{have built a}} castle at Cardiff as early as 1081 on his return from his pilgrimage to St Davids. Alternatively, the first Norman fortification may have been constructed around 1091 by Robert Fitzhamon, the lord of Gloucester. Fitzhamon invaded the region in 1090, and used the castle {{as a base for}} the occupation of the rest of southern Glamorgan over the next few years. The site <b>was</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sea and could be easily supplied by ship, was well protected by the Rivers Taff and Rhymney and also controlled the old Roman road running along the coast.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s, the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{conducted}} {{nuclear tests}} on Amchitka. Despite being {{designated as a}} national wildlife refuge by President William Taft in 1913, Amchitka was chosen as a nuclear testing site by the AEC. There were several reasons for this decision. Firstly, Amchitka <b>was</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> former Soviet Union, making it an ideal location for a nuclear test to intimidate the latter. However, the public reason given by the AEC was the island's remoteness. Forceful objections were raised against the testing {{by a number of}} organisations and groups, most notably the Aleut people, who, although they vacated the island in the 19th century after Russian fur traders reduced sea otter numbers in the area, are resident on nearby islands, and were concerned about radiation leaks as well as potential physical damage resulting from the nuclear tests.|$|E

5|$|During the 1970s, plans {{had existed}} for an {{extensive}} rapid transit system, with an underground {{section in the}} city center. Inspired by the successful Oslo Metro that had opened in 1966, similar plans were developed. The proposed network <b>was</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> current long-term plans for the light rail system, and consisted of three branches from the city center to Flaktveit, Olsvik and the airport. Four-car trains would operate at ten-minute headways. The suggestion was discussed by the city council in 1973, but no decision was taken. As an alternative, expansion of the railway from Bergen to Eidsvåg, Åsane and Nesttun was proposed. Fast commuter trains could then be supplemented with buses.|$|E
5|$|In 1825, the Bolton and Leigh Railway {{received}} Royal Assent and {{the single}} track railway was opened in 1828 bringing the railway to {{the western side of}} the township where it <b>was</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> coal mines at Howe Bridge and Gibfield. There was a railway station at Atherton Bag Lane and one further south at Atherleigh This line was connected to the Liverpool and Manchester Railway by the Kenyon and Leigh Junction Railway in 1831. It was connected to the Tyldesley–Wigan line in 1883, and a station on that line was opened at Chowbentrenamed Howe Bridge in 1901. The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway's line from Manchester to Southport passes to the north of Atherton and Atherton Station which was opened in 1887–88 remains open.|$|E
