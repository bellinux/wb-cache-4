5|$|Abduction of marriage-age {{women was}} common during the Liao dynasty. Khitans men of all social classes {{participated in the}} activity, and the abductees were both Khitan and Han. In some cases, this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> in the {{courtship}} process, where the woman would agree to the abduction and the resulting sexual intercourse, and then the abductor and abductee {{would return to the}} woman's home to announce their intention to marry. This process was known as baimen (拜門). In other cases, the abduction would be non-consensual and would result in a rape.|$|E
5|$|As the Alliance <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>Step</b> 5 league, {{its member}} clubs were {{eligible}} {{to take part}} in the FA Cup and FA Vase as long as their grounds met the required standards. The league also operated two cup competitions of its own, the knock-out League Cup, which was staged every season, and the Joe McGorian Cup, which was contested between the previous season's League Cup winners and league champions and which was first contested in 1996.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Eli Todd also viewed alcohol as the “prominent evil of the day”. On February 22, 1842, the Washington Society of Farmington was formed. They practiced total abstinence, and {{employed}} social pressure for temperance in Farmington. By 1847, 569 people {{were part of}} this society. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> forward as part of Dr. Eli Todd’s attack against alcoholism.|$|E

5|$|Gemini <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> {{forward for}} NASA's manned space program: the Gemini capsule was {{larger and more}} {{advanced}} than Mercury, capable of supporting two men {{for up to a}} two-week mission. Because of the longer mission durations, Mission Control began to be manned in shifts. In 1964, Glynn Lunney and Gene Kranz were selected by Chris Kraft to join Kraft and his deputy John Hodge as flight directors. Aged only twenty-eight, Lunney was the youngest of the four.|$|E
5|$|In one draft, Picard kills Data {{early in}} the film, and the android is later resurrected to help the Captain in the finale. The first two drafts {{featured}} the Romulans as the protagonists, since they had never prominently appeared in a Star Trek film. The second draft was seen by Jonathan Dolgen at the studio; Dolgen was not pleased and Patrick Stewart {{thought that it would}} have been only suitable for a television episode. In the third draft, the Son'a were introduced as the children of the Ba'ku and the alien race that wanted to plunder the planet. That version also included the crew sub-plots, such as the Troi-Riker romance and the regeneration of La Forge's eyes. Stewart, who was concerned that the film <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> back in scope from First Contact, was consulted on the treatments.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{appointment}} of Irving Thalberg as general manager at Universal, Stroheim's defiance of commercial and industrial norms was no longer tolerated. After Thalberg's prior shutdown of Foolish Wives in 1921 (which shot nonstop for eleven months), and after six weeks of filming on Merry-Go-Round, Stroheim was finally fired from the studio on October 6, 1922. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> unprecedented in Hollywood, heralding {{a new era in}} which the producer and the studio would hold artistic control over actors and directors. However, by this time Stroheim had received several offers of contracts with other studios, even before being fired from Universal. He had met with executives of the Goldwyn Company on September 14, 1922, less than a month before, and he formally signed with them in late November.|$|E

5|$|Fernando Alonso {{received}} a new, revised combustion engine for his car, his third of five allowed {{over the course}} of the season without receiving a grid penalty. Power unit supplier Honda stressed that they had not used any development tokens, a set of limited allowed changes to the units, but had instead only improved reliability. The team also equipped both cars with new batteries and electronics control units, set to improve the reliability of the cars as well. During the two-day testing session that took place after the previous Grand Prix at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, Renault introduced an updated version of their power unit, which was used during the test to the satisfaction of driver Kevin Magnussen, who declared that the new unit <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> forward in both power and driveability. He urged the team to pull the introduction of the power unit forward to the Monaco race, instead of the following Grand Prix in Canada as originally planned. Renault chose to do so, however, they were only able to hand out one updated unit to both their works team and Red Bull, who used them under the name TAG Heuer. The two units were eventually given to Magnussen at Renault and Daniel Ricciardo at Red Bull.|$|E

25|$|Temple O and Temple A {{of which}} little remains {{except for the}} rocky {{basement}} and the altar which was constructed between 490 and 460BC. They had nearly identical structures, {{similar to that of}} Temple E on the East Hill. The peristyle was 16.2 metres wide and 40.2 metres long with 6 x 14 columns (6.23 metres high). Inside there was a pronaos in antis, a naos with an adyton and an opisthodomos in antis, separate from the naos. The naos <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> higher than the pronaos and the adyton <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> higher again. In the wall between the pronaos and the naos in Temple A two spiral staircases led to the gallery (or floor) above. The pronaos of Temple A has a mosaic pavement showing symbolic figures of the Phoenician goddess Tanit, a caduceus, the Sun, a crown, and a bull’s head, which testifies to the reuse of the space as a religious or domestic area in the Punic period. Temple O was dedicated to Poseidon or perhaps Athena; Temple A to the Dioscuri or perhaps to Apollo.|$|E

25|$|In astronomy, Galactocentrism is {{the theory}} that our sun is {{at or near the}} center of the galaxy. Observations by William Herschel in 1785 {{indicated}} that the Milky Way was a separate disk-shaped galaxy with the sun in a central position. Although proved incorrect by Harlow Shapley in 1918, the theory <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> in the development of cosmological models as the speculation of the existence of other galaxies, comparable in size and structure to our own, placed the earth in its proper perspective with respect to the rest of the universe.|$|E
25|$|Ferris {{played the}} leading female role in Edward Bond's play Saved at the Royal Court Theatre in London in 1965. This {{was subject to}} {{censorship}} by the Lord Chamberlain who was instrumental in bringing a successful prosecution when the producers went ahead and staged the play without cuts before private audiences. Despite the controversial subject matter, which included {{a scene in which}} a baby was stoned to death in its pram, the case <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> towards the Lord Chamberlain's losing his censorship role under the Theatres Act 1968.|$|E
25|$|The game's plot {{revolves}} around a dictator named General Sabio and a missing commander from Spencer's organization, Colonel Brubaker. Spencer {{and a team}} of four other bionics are sent to locate Brubaker and his platoon and help them complete their mission of disarming Sabio's missiles. The team's original mission evolves as the bionics, split into three teams, face opposition greater than they have previously faced. Reception from critics was lukewarm, with the game averaging in the 60% range at aggregate websites GameRankings and Metacritic. Some critics praised the new gameplay mechanics, while others felt that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> down from its predecessor.|$|E

Tiffany's put the United States {{on the world}} map in terms of jewellery and gained fame creating dazzling commissions for people such as the wife of Abraham Lincoln. Later, it would gain popular notoriety as {{the setting of the}} film Breakfast at Tiffany's. In France, Pierre Cartier founded Cartier SA in 1847, while 1884 saw the founding of Bulgari in Italy.

25|$|Foster {{took his}} own advice and became a union {{business}} agent for a local of the Brotherhood of Railway Carmen of America in Chicago. He continued his syndicalist campaign, this time through the International Trade Union Educational League, while obtaining a position as a general organizer for the AFL in 1915. His syndicalism led him to drop any criticism of the more conservative union leaders; in his eyes, organizing workers <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> toward dismantling capitalism. The ITUEL did not so much seek to take power in those organizations in which its members were active, as to steer them in a more progressive direction.|$|E
25|$|In late 1940s, Cage started {{developing}} further {{methods of}} breaking away with traditional harmony. For instance, in String Quartet in Four Parts (1950) Cage first composed {{a number of}} gamuts: chords with fixed instrumentation. The piece progresses from one gamut to another. In each instance the gamut was selected only based on whether it contains the note necessary for the melody, and so {{the rest of the}} notes do not form any directional harmony. Concerto for prepared piano (1950–51) used a system of charts of durations, dynamics, melodies, etc., from which Cage would choose using simple geometric patterns. The last movement of the concerto <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> towards using chance procedures, which Cage adopted soon afterwards.|$|E
