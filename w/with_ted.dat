40|$|Trisomy 21 (T 21), {{trisomy 18}} (T 18) and trisomy 13 (T 13) {{represent}} {{the most common}} autosomal trisomies detected in live-born infants. Previous studies have addressed interventions, morbidities and survival in term or near-term infants <b>with</b> <b>T</b> 21, T 18 or T 13, or were limited by {{a small number of}} patients. However, the combination of one of these chromosomal anomalies and very low birth weight (VLBW) presents greater challenges. Data from the NICHD Neonatal Research Network (NRN) and from the Vermont Oxford Network (VON) databases were used to examine the frequency, interventions, risk of mortality and neonatal morbidities, including patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), late onset sepsis (LOS), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), among VLBW infants <b>with</b> <b>T</b> 21, T 18 or T 13 compared to VLBW infants without major birth defects (BD) and VLBW infants with non-chromosomal BD. Anthropometric VON charts for the assessment of birth weight for gestational age among 22 week to term infants <b>with</b> <b>T</b> 21, T 18 or T 13 were also developed. In the VON database (n= 539, 509), the frequency of VLBW infants diagnosed <b>with</b> <b>T</b> 21 was 1681 (0. 31 %), <b>with</b> <b>T</b> 18 was 1416 (0. 27 %), and <b>with</b> <b>T</b> 13 was 435 (0. 08 %). Major surgery was reported for 30. 4 % of infants <b>with</b> <b>T</b> 21, 9. 2 % <b>with</b> <b>T</b> 18, and 6. 8 % <b>with</b> <b>T</b> 13. In-hospital mortality occurred for 33. 1 % of infants <b>with</b> <b>T</b> 21, 89. 0 % <b>with</b> <b>T</b> 18, and 92. 4 % <b>with</b> <b>T</b> 13. Median survival time was 4 days (95 % CI: 3 - 4) among infants <b>with</b> <b>T</b> 18 and 3 days (95 % CI: 2 - 4) among infants <b>with</b> <b>T</b> 13. Birth weight for gestational age charts were created using VON data with a total of 5147 infants <b>with</b> <b>T</b> 21 aged 22 - 41 weeks, 1053 infants <b>with</b> <b>T</b> 18 aged 22 - 41 weeks, and 613 infants <b>with</b> <b>T</b> 13 aged 22 - 40 weeks. Among the three groups, infants <b>with</b> <b>T</b> 18 were the most likely to be growth restricted while infants <b>with</b> <b>T</b> 21 were the least likely to be growth restricted. The new anthropometric VON charts for infants <b>with</b> <b>T</b> 21 were also compared to the Lubchenco and Fenton charts and both showed frequent misclassification of infants <b>with</b> <b>T</b> 21 as small or large for gestational age. In the NICHD NRN database (n= 52, 259), 133 (0. 26 %) VLBW infants were diagnosed <b>with</b> <b>T</b> 21, 132 (0. 25 %) <b>with</b> <b>T</b> 18 and 40 (0. 08 %) <b>with</b> <b>T</b> 13. The adjusted relative risk, estimated using Poisson regression models with robust variance estimators, showed an increased risk of death, PDA, NEC, LOS, and BPD among infants <b>with</b> <b>T</b> 21 relative to infants with no BD. Relative to infants with non-chromosomal BD, infants <b>with</b> <b>T</b> 21 were at increased risk of PDA and NEC. A trend toward a lower risk of ROP was observed among infants <b>with</b> <b>T</b> 21 compared to infants with non-chromosomal BD and infants without major BD. Infants <b>with</b> <b>T</b> 13, but not infants <b>with</b> <b>T</b> 18, {{were less likely to be}} mechanically ventilated than infants <b>with</b> <b>T</b> 21 and infants without BD. Infants <b>with</b> <b>T</b> 18 had increased risk of PDA compared to infants <b>with</b> <b>T</b> 13, infants <b>with</b> <b>T</b> 21 and infants without BD and increased risk of BPD compared to infants <b>with</b> <b>T</b> 21 and infants without BD. The current studies evaluated the largest cohorts of VLBW infants <b>with</b> <b>T</b> 21, T 18 or T 13. These data are important to help families and care providers make informed decisions involving the care of their VLBW infants with these chromosomal anomalies...|$|R

Methods: Two hundred and forty five patients from the diabetic clinic at Muhimbili Hospital were recruited for a cross sectional study. Patients were clinically classified into groups <b>with</b> Type 1 (<b>T</b> 1 D) and Type 2 diabetes (T 2 D); there were 94 patients <b>with</b> <b>T</b> 1 D and 151 <b>with</b> <b>T</b> 2 D. Autoantibodies for GAD and IA 2 were measured with an assay based on radioligand binding. Fasting and random blood glucose, HbA 1 c, and C-peptide levels were also determined. Results: Of the patients <b>with</b> <b>T</b> 1 D, 28 (29. 8 %) were GADA positive and 20 (21. 3 %) were IA 2 A positive. The overall occurrence of any autoantibody was 42. 6 %. The GAD and IA 2 autoantibodies were detected more frequently among patients <b>with</b> <b>T</b> 1 D than among patients <b>with</b> <b>T</b> 2 D (P < 0. 001). A higher autoantibody prevalence was observed with combined GADA and IA 2 A measurements compared to individual autoantibody measurements; 40 (42. 6 %) patients <b>with</b> <b>T</b> 1 D versus 11 (7. 3 %) <b>with</b> <b>T</b> 2 D had at least one positive autoantibody titer. There was no correlation between duration of disease and detection of autoantibodies in patients <b>with</b> <b>T</b> 1 D. There was a strong association with family history of diabetes among the autoantibody positive versus autoantibody negative patients <b>with</b> <b>T</b> 1 D (p < 0. 01). Conclusion: The prevalence of GAD and IA 2 autoantibodies among African patients <b>with</b> <b>T</b> 1 D in Dar es Salaam was the same as that reported previously for South Africa and Ethiopia. It was much higher than the prevalence of islet cell autoantibodies (ICA) reported from the same clinic about 15 years ago.
