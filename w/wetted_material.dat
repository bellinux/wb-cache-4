40|$|There is an {{important}} potential for a development of a building system, if the present AACblock plants are completed with high performance concrete and pre-stressing technique. This can be done as a continuation of a present AAC production or in a site factory. Hybrid cooperation between AAC and concrete {{is not a new}} technology. Traditionally, AAC is covered with rendering. The <b>wetted</b> <b>material</b> is first sprayed with cement slurry after which comes lime/cement-based rendering which strengthens the wall and supplies a mechanical protection. AAC blocks can be used as infill members in concrete deck plates and concrete framed walls (Hellers, 1993), in which the shrinkage of the surrounding concrete locks completely the cured blocks into a stable composite. A good cooperation between AAC and concrete is a requirement for the pre-stressed hybrid. This combination has been investigated with reference to bond and moisture content. The interface must have sufficient bond to supply shear strength to the structural member. Also, the concrete should be suitable for pre-stressing which requires a minimum strength class K 40. Here, K 60 is applied in order to reduce creep and avoid creep failure of the AAC. A production layout for the purpose is suggested. This research consists of three parts: 1 - Hybrid concrete elements The principal formulation of hybrids, built on cooperation between two concrete materials, a weak AAC and a strong HPC poured on top, shows that this combination unites the most favourable qualities of the two concretes into a structural element with rational building technology. Load-bearing capacity is good, and the fire protection is excellent. Through pre-stressing of the structural concrete, a crack-free behaviour is guaranteed up to the service limit, and deflection from dead weight (incl. floor covering and possibly half the service load) be eliminated. The most important structural elements needed in a building system could be taken as hybrids. In drawings, different members like floor- roof- and wall members, window and door lintels are shown. 2 - Production system for hybrids AAC blocks form a bed containing the pre-stressing steel in slits and on which high performance concrete is poured. Pre-stressing brings the two concretes together. This is especially important for the shear capacity of a building member, by which extra dowels can be omitted. The pre-stressing force is anchored by plates directly against the cured AAC blocks. A special pre-stressing bed is not required. The production is arranged {{in such a way that}} necessary equipment (trays, form strips, wedges, locks) are circulated within twenty-four hours. The necessary manpower for this facility is analysed. Normally 8 men are needed per shift. A detailed conceptual production layout for a hybrid production plant is included for discussion. See figure 6. 2 (suggested production layout). 3 - Application in building The hybrid members are united at joints and through seams. Continuity over connections is achieved by filling seams with mortar grout. Reinforcement may be included to achieve ductility. By a similar method, it is possible to make connections between horizontal and vertical building members. Common connection details are shown in the report. This building method replaces the equivalent method with concrete or AAC members, and it is in fact a coordination between these two. The maximum span of floor members is up to 9 m. It makes the system suitable for modern residential house production, but also suitable for office buildings, industrial halls and other applications. See attached drawings, part 2 and part 3.

40|$|A {{shift from}} batch to {{continuous}} processing is challenging but equally rewarding for the pharmaceutical sector. This opportunity for moving beyond traditional batch processing is possible {{due to a}} change of attitude in the regulatory environment by {{the publication of the}} process analytical technology (PAT) guidance. However, in order to utilise this opportunity, detailed process understanding about the key processes in pharmaceutical manufacturing is required to turn this transformation to the continuous mode into a success. Continuous wet granulation is a crucial part of future continuous manufacturing of solid dosage forms. Continuous high shear wet granulation is performed using a twin-screw granulator (TSG) which is characterised by a modular screw profile including a sequence of different screw elements with various shapes, orientations and functions. A TSG achieves mixing and granulation by a complex interplay between the screw configuration and process settings (e. g. feed rate, screw speed, etc.) to produce granules with certain specifications in a short time. Therefore, a fundamental understanding of these complex phenomena is required to optimise and control this new technology. Analysing the twin-screw wet granulation to a satisfactory degree is only possible when sufficient information on the rheo-kinetic characteristics of the granulation mixture is available. Thus an investigation of residence time distribution (RTD), the solid-liquid mixing, and the resulting granule size distribution (GSD) evolution governed by the field conditions in the TSG contain interesting information about mixing and different granulation rate processes such as aggregation and breakage. For this purpose, a combination of experimental and mathematical techniques/approaches was applied in this work. Additionally, a single placebo formulation based on α-lactose monohydrate was granulated in the experimental studies performed to verify the hypothesis proposed in this work. The characterisation of <b>wetted</b> <b>material</b> transport and mixing inside the confined spaces of the rotating screws was performed by the experimental determination of the residence time distribution at different process conditions and screw configurations using near infrared chemical imaging. The experimental data was later compared with a conceptual model based on classical chemical engineering methods to estimate the parameters of the model and to analyse the effects of changes in number of kneading discs and their stagger angle, screw speed, material throughput and liquid-to-solid ratio (L/S) on RTD. According to this study, increased screw speed resulted in a low mean residence time mean residence time and wider RTD, i. e. more axial mixing. Increasing powder feed rate increased mean residence time by higher throughput force while increasing L/S increased mean residence time by raising the sluggishness or inertia of the material in the barrel. The material transport in the mixing zone(s) of the TSG became more plug-flow like. Thus, {{an increase in the number}} of kneading discs reduced the axial mixing in the barrel. In addition, to understand the GSD dynamics as a function of individual screw modules along the TSG barrel, the change in GSD was investigated both experimentally and mathematically. Using a TSG which allows the opening of the barrel, samples from several locations inside the TSG barrel were collected after granulation at different process conditions and screw configurations. A detailed experimental investigation was hence performed to understand the granule size and shape dynamics in the granulator. The experimental data from this study together with the residence time measurements was then used for calibrating a population balance model for each kneading disc module in the twin-screw granulator in order to obtain an improved insight into the role of the kneading discs at certain locations inside the TSG. The study established that the kneading block in the screw configuration acts as a plug-flow zone inside the granulator. It was found that a balance between the throughput force and conveying rate is required to obtain a good axial mixing inside the twin-screw granulator. Also, a high throughput can be achieved by increasing the liquid-solid ratio and screw speed. Furthermore, the study indicated that the first kneading block after wetting caused an increased aggregation rate, which was reduced after the material processing by the second kneading block. In contrast, the breakage rate in the increased successively along the length of the granulator. Such a reversion in physical phenomena indicated potential separation between the granulation regimes, which can be promising for future design and advanced control of the continuous twin-screw granulation process. In another experimental study the transport and mixing (both axial and bulk mixing of solid-liquid) was linked to the GSD of the produced granules. This study demonstrated that insufficient solid-liquid mixing due to inability of the currently used kneading discs is the reason behind the inferior performance of the TSG in terms of yield. It was shown that other factors which support mixing such as higher axial mixing at a high screw speed and a low fill ratio support an increase in the yield. However, more effort is required to explore non-conventional screw elements with modified geometries to find screws which can effectively mix the solid-liquid material. Furthermore, in order to generalise the TSG knowledge, a regime map based approach was applied. Herewith, the scale independent parameters, L/S and specific mechanical energy (SME) were correlated. It was shown that an increasing L/S strongly drives the GSD towards a larger mean granule size. However, an increasing energy input to the system can effectively be used to lower the mean granule size and also narrow the width of the size distribution. Along with this, particle-scale simulations for the characterisation of liquid distribution in the mixing zone of the granulator were performed. It was found that the agglomeration is rather a delayed process which takes place by redistribution of liquid once the excess liquid on the particle surface is transferred to the liquid bridges. Moreover, the transfer of liquid from particle surface to liquid bridges, i. e. initialisation of agglomeration, is most dominant in the intermeshing region of the kneading discs. Besides the major outcomes of this work, i. e. building fundamental knowledge on pharmaceutical twin-screw wet granulation by combining experimental and theoretical approaches to diagnose the transport, mixing and constitutive mechanisms, several gaps and potential research needs were identified as well. As the regulators have opened up to increasingly rely on the science- and risk-based holistic development of pharmaceutical processes and products for commercialisation, the opportunity as well as responsibility lies with academic and industrial partners to develop a systematic framework and scientific approach to utilise this opportunity efficiently...|$|E
