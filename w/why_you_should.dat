25|$|I will, however, {{tell you}} {{just one thing}} about the war, my first story and my last. I was asked by some American friends to search out the grave of their son near Bastogne. I found it where they told me I would, but it was among 27,000 others, and I told myself that here, Niven, were 27,000 reasons <b>why</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> keep your mouth shut after the war.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Sörenstam {{was highly}} {{critical}} of other female golfers who tried {{to play in the}} PGA Tour – her comments to Michelle Wie for playing on the men's tour: [...] "I really don't know why Michelle continues to do this. We have a major this week and, if you can't qualify for a major, I don't see any reason <b>why</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> play with the men." ...|$|E

[...] "Sometimes I think <b>you</b> would. <b>Why</b> shouldn't <b>you?</b> <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>you</b> marry me? <b>Why</b> shouldn't <b>you</b> {{try to do}} with me what you've done with other women? I don't know {{anything}} about the world, about life. I'm nobody. Why shouldn't you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>why</b> <b>should</b> <b>you</b> want {{to spite}} her? If she is Mary's child, she is your brother's child also. If {{she is my}} niece, she must be your niece too. <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>you</b> want to spite her? <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>you</b> try to do her such a terrible injury?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Very likely. But {{none the}} less I saved <b>you.</b> <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>you</b> bear me ill will? It is {{no fault of}} mine if I hold your estate.' ...|$|R
500|$|The {{costumes and}} looks {{for each of}} the {{different}} women were chosen by Spears and Kahn. The scenes in the sauna were suggested by Kahn, {{as a response to the}} attacks Spears received over the years about her weight. He stated, [...] "I knew that the whole world would be watching, so I wanted something in there that stated, 'This is Britney, this is <b>why</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> respect her'". The set was cleared for two hours, leaving her and Kahn alone shooting the sequence. Kahn also decided to end the video with an image of Spears smiling, because [...] "We just needed to tell everybody she's OK".|$|E
500|$|Connie Talbot's Holiday Magic {{received}} mixed reviews. Sunny Tse, {{reviewing the}} album for the South China Morning Post, {{said that the}} album was [...] "just right for the kids", but added that Talbot's [...] "stunning rendition of 'Ave Maria' ... will blow your mind". Jonathan Takiff, writing for The Philadelphia Daily News, said that [...] "istening to her trill through 'Silent Night,' the calypso-flavored 'Mary's Boy Child' and 'Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree' might inspire your kids." [...] He gave the album a B-. David Burger, writing for The Salt Lake Tribune, gave the album a B, and praised Talbot's range, saying that there were [...] "sweet, playful and jazzy arrangements". Reviewers also praised the link with the Toys for Tots Foundation, which Tse considered [...] "one more reason <b>why</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> grab a copy." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{record was}} {{released}} on February 7, 2012 in both standard and deluxe edition versions, with the latter containing a bonus DVD titled The Downtown Sessions. This DVD included acoustic versions of [...] "Panama", [...] "You and Your Blues" [...] and [...] "Beautiful Girls".

Its music video {{was released on}}line on April 13, and on May 4 a promotional vinyl 7" [...] single was serviced to 83 independent record stores to be given with purchases of A Different Kind of Truth. The band members opted to avoid excessive promotional press, an attitude that Roth described as [...] "a sterling statement" [...] on them not following [...] "so many people on television telling you <b>why</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> buy something".|$|E

6000|$|... "Leonardo, we {{have been}} friends, have we not? <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>you</b> seek to do that which will make us enemies for ever? I have broken no faith with you; I never gave you one word of hope. I never loved you; I never could have loved <b>you!</b> <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>you</b> seek to murder the man whom I do love, and make me miserable for ever?" ...|$|R
6000|$|GREGORY. I {{think we}} had better let bygones be bygones. [To Mrs. Juno, very tenderly] You will forgive me, won't <b>you?</b> <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>you</b> let a moment's {{forgetfulness}} embitter all our future life? ...|$|R
500|$|Jervis {{could also}} be {{exceptionally}} kind when {{he felt that the}} situation warranted it. On one occasion, while the fleet was becalmed the men of the flagship were ordered to bathe. The men leapt over the side to swim in a sail that had been lowered over the side. One of the men, a senior able seaman, jumped in wearing his trousers. In one of the pockets he had his prize money and back pay that he had been saving for several years. The bank notes were destroyed by the water and when the man came aboard and discovered what had happened he began to weep. The Admiral saw the man and asked the problem. One of his officers told him and St Vincent went to his cabin. When he returned he had the crew mustered and called the man forward. [...] "Roger Odell you are convicted, Sir, by your own appearance of tarnishing the British oak with tears. What have you to say in your defence <b>why</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> not receive what you deserve?" [...] The man told him what had happened and St Vincent replied [...] "Roger Odell {{you are one of the}} best men in this ship you are moreover a captain of a top and in my life I never saw a man behave himself better in battle than you did in the Victory in the action with the Spanish fleet. To show therefore that your Commander-in-chief will never pass over merit wheresoever he may find it. There is your money Sir!" [...] The Earl produced £70 of his own money and presented it to the surprised sailor [...] "but no more tears mind, no more tears Sir".|$|E

2500|$|Feeling that he {{had failed}} to {{sufficiently}} address and explain the context of his relationship with the Reverend, Obama began writing the speech that became [...] "A More Perfect Union". Obama's usual speechwriting practice during the 2008 campaign was to discuss major themes with speechwriter Jon Favreau, let Favreau write a draft, and then edit the result. However, on Saturday, March 15, Obama dictated a lengthy draft of this speech to Favreau, who edited the speech the next day. [...] Obama stayed up until 3:00 a.m. Sunday night working on the speech, and continued to work on it Monday and {{in the early hours of}} Tuesday. [...] He sent his final draft of the speech to Favreau and campaign strategist David Axelrod. After reading Obama's final draft, Axelrod sent him an email saying [...] "This is <b>why</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> be president." ...|$|E

2500|$|On Kristallnacht, an anti-Semitic pogrom {{that took}} place on the night of November 9, 1938 and {{resulted}} in the destruction of hundreds of synagogues and the deaths of 91 Jews, Trepp was arrested and placed in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, where he was held as one of as many as 30,000 Jews who were arrested and held in prison camps by the Nazis. In the wake of Jews being detained and dying, Trepp saw his role as being part of [...] "a very rewarding rabbinate because the Jews needed me". [...] He recalled the inmates being called out in Sachsenhausen at 4:00 in the morning, seeing the guard towers manned with soldiers holding machine guns and being told [...] "You are the dregs of humanity. I don't see <b>why</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> live". [...] He told God that he was prepared to die, but was overcome with the feeling that [...] "God was with me. I know God was there. In the concentration camp with me. And it was the worst place for it. That's why it was the best." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The report," [...] he said, [...] "is {{out of your}} hands. The {{official}} {{decision of}} your Government will reach us before long.
