The actual competition is short, with victory usually decided after a single pull (although some contests are played to best of three). Because {{of the association}} of the Western direction with the concept of fertility and fecundity, the match is often fixed to ensure that the West team win (and thus ensure a bounteous harvest). After celebrating at the house of their team's captain, the <b>winners</b> <b>will</b> then proceed to the house of the losing team's captain to offer their commiserations; this often resembles a funeral procession. Both ropes are taken by the winning team, dissected and sold; the straw taken from them is believed to have unusual protective or nourishing properties.|$|E

The playoff will involve a total of 12 teams—nine from First Division A, and three from First Division B (the renamed Second Division).

The remaining four teams will play a relegation playoff to determine the one team that will drop into the 2017–18 Belgian First Amateur Division.|$|E
500|$|Reality {{television}} shows played an important, influential {{role on the}} charts during the decade. Hear'Say won the original series of Popstars in 2000 and topped the charts with their debut single [...] "Pure and Simple". A trend developed as this feat was replicated by Pop Idol <b>winners</b> <b>Will</b> Young (2002) and Michelle McManus (2003), and runners-up Gareth Gates and Sam & Mark; 2002 Fame Academy winner David Sneddon, and {{the winner of the}} first series of The X Factor, Steve Brookstein, in 2005. Reality television winners did especially well during the Christmas season; every Christmas number one from 2005 to 2008 came from an X Factor winner. Shayne Ward reached number one in 2005 with [...] "That's My Goal", and he was followed by Leona Lewis, Leon Jackson and Alexandra Burke. Girls Aloud, the [...] winners, also had the Christmas number one in 2002 with [...] "Sound of the Underground."

2500|$|Combinatorial auction is any auction for the {{simultaneous}} sale {{of more than}} one item where bidders can place bids on an [...] "all-or-nothing" [...] basis on [...] "packages" [...] rather than just individual items. That is, a bidder can specify that he or she will pay for items A and B, but only if he or she gets both. In combinatorial auctions, determining the winning bidder(s) can be a complex process where even the bidder with the highest individual bid is not guaranteed to win. For example, in an auction with four items (W, X, Y and Z), if Bidder A offers $50 for items W & Y, Bidder B offers $30 for items W & X, Bidder C offers $5 for items X & Z and Bidder D offers $30 for items Y & Z, the <b>winners</b> <b>will</b> be Bidders B & D while Bidder A misses out because the combined bids of Bidders B & D is higher ($60) than for Bidders A and C ($55).|$|E
