5|$|By mid 1945, the {{economic}} drain on Britain {{due to her}} sustained war effort was becoming critical, and a new proposal, with an armour arrangement similar to the modernized HMS Renown, christened 'Design X', was submitted by a design committee headed by Admiral Servaes to the DNC. 'Design X', along with the earlier preferred 'B3' variant Battleship design were further refined through October 1945, when further design work was informally suspended on all but the new Mk III 16 inch turret. This <b>work</b> <b>too</b> was finally cancelled by the First Sea Lord in late 1949 and brought a final end to battleship design and construction for the Royal Navy.|$|E
5|$|Hergé's book {{sales were}} higher than ever, and {{translations}} were being produced for the British, Spanish, and Scandinavian markets. He was receiving international press attention, with articles on his work appearing in France-Observateur, The Listener, and Times Literary Supplement. Paul Vandromme authored an un-critical book on Hergé, Le Monde de Tintin ("The World of Tintin"), published by Gallimard; Hergé vetoed {{the inclusion of a}} proposed preface by Roger Nimier after finding its praise for his own <b>work</b> <b>too</b> embarrassing. Radio adaptations of The Adventures of Tintin were produced, as was an animated cartoon series produced by Belvision, Hergé's Adventures of Tintin. Two live-action films were also produced, Tintin and the Golden Fleece (1961) and Tintin and the Blue Oranges (1964), the former of which Hergé had been closely involved with.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{intended}} to be a full-length opera, Twice was composed between 1994 and 1996, undergoing substantial reworking before Turnage found a form with which he was satisfied. It was first performed in 1997 when it was put on both in the concert hall and in the opera house. The critical reception has been generally favourable, with several authors commenting positively about the instrumental writing and emotional impact of the work, though some critics see limitations in the libretto, find the mood of the <b>work</b> <b>too</b> unrelenting or note the great demands that the vocal writing provides for the soloist.|$|E

5|$|Sargent's break {{came when}} Sir Henry Wood visited De Montfort Hall, Leicester, early in 1921 with the Queen's Hall orchestra. As it was {{customary}} to commission a piece {{from a local}} composer, Wood invited Sargent to write a piece entitled Impression on a Windy Day. Sargent completed the <b>work</b> <b>too</b> late for Wood to {{have enough time to}} learn it, and so Wood called on Sargent to conduct the first performance himself. Wood recognised not only the worth of the piece but also Sargent's talent as a conductor and gave him the chance to make his debut conducting the work at Wood's annual season of promenade concerts, generally known as the Proms, in the Queen's Hall on 11 October of the same year.|$|E
5|$|Things {{apparently}} get better: {{the flat}} is tidy, Tom is smartly dressed and clean-shaven. Gerri is happily chatting to him. Tom answers {{the door to}} Stevie, who asks Tom {{to come back to}} work. He is alarmed to see Tom call Gerri; Stevie says that Gerri was killed in a car accident, and that Tom went back to <b>work</b> <b>too</b> soon. Stevie heads to the bathroom to get Tom's medication, but freezes when he sees the corpse of Migg in the bath. Tom tells him not to worry, and that Migg is not real. He invites Stevie to stay for coffee, saying Gerri is just boiling the kettle.|$|E
5|$|Skyscrapers {{continued}} to grow in height throughout the 1920s. In part this {{was the result of}} improvements in technology: steel-frame structures had become increasingly efficient, while improvements in elevator design made taller buildings easier to ascend. Commercial factors were at <b>work</b> <b>too,</b> as growing commercial demand pushed up rents, enabling taller projects, while the higher offices attracted more sunlight, permitting the charging of premium rents. The tallest buildings could also acquire publicity for their owners, in turn making it easier to find and keep the best tenants. Furthermore, the higher the cost of the underlying real estate, the taller a building needed to be to generate a suitable return on the investment, and the minimum sensible commercial height for a skyscraper project grew to between 40 and 45 stories. 70 story skyscrapers became relatively common, although an influential 1930 study demonstrated that the best rate of return on a skyscraper was to build it 63 stories high, returning an annual profit of 10.25 percent.|$|E

As originally cast, starring roles had Clark Gable as General Banner and Gregory Peck as Major Bond, but contractual problems required a recasting, with Holden taking {{on the role of}} star as well as producer.|$|E

25|$|Mac Fhirbhisigh had {{returned}} to work for Ware in Dublin by early November. On 6 November 1666 he commenced a translation, into English, of part of the Annals of Lackan. This <b>work</b> <b>too</b> is lost, and his translation of the years 1443–68 is almost all that survives of a work compiled by {{members of his own}} family since before 1397. With the death of Sir James on 1 December, Dubhaltach's employment and time in Dublin came to an end.|$|E
25|$|Although age is not {{necessarily}} a prerequisite, many ballet students do not begin to dance en pointe earlier than approximately 12–14 years of age because bones in the feet are often too soft prior to that age and, in such cases, serious and permanent foot injuries could result from starting pointe <b>work</b> <b>too</b> early. The long bones in feet begin to harden within the ages of 8 to 14, dancing en pointe before one's bones have hardened can lead to trauma and growth-plate fractures that create deformed feet.|$|E
25|$|There {{followed}} {{in quick succession}} two musicals which have secured Kelly's reputation as a major figure in the American musical film, An American in Paris (1951) and – probably {{the most popular and}} admired of all film musicals – Singin' in the Rain (1952). As co-director, lead star and choreographer, Kelly was the central driving force. Johnny Green, head of music at MGM at the time, said of him:Gene is easygoing as long as you know exactly what you are doing when you're working with him. He's a hard taskmaster and he loves hard work. If you want to play on his team you'd better like hard <b>work,</b> <b>too.</b> He isn't cruel but he is tough, and if Gene believed in something he didn't care who he was talking to, whether it was Louis B. Mayer or the gatekeeper. He wasn't awed by anybody, and he had a good record of getting what he wanted.|$|E

25|$|The premiere {{took place}} at Versailles on 4 December 1773 in the {{presence}} of King Louis XV as part of the wedding celebrations of the Comte d'Artois and Princess Maria Theresa of Savoy. Despite the magnificent staging, the audience found the <b>work</b> <b>too</b> long and boring, although critics praised some of Gossec's music, particularly the ballet sections. Sabinus transferred to the Paris Opéra on 22 February 1774. By now, Gossec had decided to refashion the piece in line with the criticisms it had received and reduce it to four acts. But even the shortened version failed to please audiences and Sabinus was soon withdrawn. It had enjoyed 11 performances in all. Gossec's plans to revive Sabinus were thwarted by the arrival of Christoph Willibald Gluck on the Parisian scene. Gluck's Iphigénie en Aulide, which premiered in April 1774, changed the face of French opera for good and made Sabinus look obsolete (although Gossec later claimed that the innovations he had made in Sabinus had paved the way for Gluck's success).|$|E
25|$|Greater issues {{arose in}} the 1990’s, when supermodel Kate Moss popularized the stick-thin figure instead. The fashion {{industry}} pushed her image further with the ‘heroin-chic’ look, which dominated the catwalks during that time. This was communicated through waifish appearances, bony structures, thin limbs, and an androgynous figure. Although this extreme period was only short-lived, the 2000’s saw {{the rise of the}} Victoria’s Secret models, who altered beauty norms to include slim but healthy figures, with large breasts and bottoms, flat and visible abs, and prominent thigh gaps. Hence, women started pursuing cosmetic surgery practices; on top of diets and exercise regimes, to attain the perfect appearance. Nevertheless, curves are back in season and positive measures are now being taken to promote a better body image. The emergence of fitness trends, plus-size models, and other better role models in the fashion and media industries are other factors at <b>work</b> <b>too.</b> Contrariwise, the advancement of technologies, and the pressures from the media, has unfortunately triggered an even greater societal importance on the way we look as an indication of our personal value.|$|E

[...] Convenor of the Urban Design Alliance doubted the openness of consultation, saying that [...] "the government had engineered its results". Dr Li Pang-kwong, of Lingnan University, said that the problematic framework of the councils has led them to <b>work</b> <b>too</b> closely with government. He said the 'copy and paste' Queen's Pier motions passed by 13 councils to support government decisions was a rubber-stamp, and a clear sign that councils lacked independence.|$|E

500|$|Sappho's poetry was {{probably}} first written down on Lesbos, either in her lifetime or shortly afterwards, initially {{probably in the}} form of a score for performers of Sappho's work.

[...] Some time in the second or third century, Alexandrian scholars produced a critical edition of Sappho's poetry. [...] There may have been more than one Alexandrian edition – John J. Winkler argues for two, one edited by Aristophanes of Byzantium and another by his pupil Aristarchus of Samothrace. [...] This is not certain – ancient sources tell us that Aristarchus' edition of Alcaeus replaced the edition by Aristophanes, but are silent on whether Sappho's <b>work,</b> <b>too,</b> went through multiple editions.|$|E
