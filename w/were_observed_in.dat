Sand was also deposited behind them into the brackish marshes, burying vegetation. The freshwater marshes were severely damaged by the wind and surge, some of them completely destroyed. The severe erosion created new waterways connecting inland bodies of water with the Gulf of Mexico, which eventually led to further erosion of inland lagoons.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{is limited}} {{evidence}} that the DOTS (directly observed therapy, short course) strategy for tuberculosis (TB) control can contain the emergence and spread of drug resistance {{in the absence of}} second-line treatment. We compared drug-resistance levels between 1996 and 2001 in the south of Vietnam, an area with a well-functioning DOTS program. METHODS: Sputum specimens were collected from consecutively diagnosed patients with smear-positive TB at 40 randomly selected public TB clinics. Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates were tested for susceptibility to first-line drugs. RESULTS: Among 888 new patients in 2001, resistance to any drug <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> 238 (26. 3 %), resistance to isoniazid <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> 154 (16. 6 %), resistance to rifampin <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> 22 (2. 0 %), resistance to ethambutol <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> 12 (1. 1 %), resistance to streptomycin <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> 173 (19. 4 %), and resistance to both isoniazid and rifampicin (multidrug resistance [MDR]) <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> 20 (1. 8 % [95 % confidence interval, 1. 0 %- 3. 3 %]). Among 136 previously treated patients in 2001, any resistance <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> 89 (62. 9 %), and MDR <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> 35 (23. 2 %). The prevalence of any drug resistance and of streptomycin resistance among new patients had decreased significantly (P <. 01) since 1996; there was no increase in the prevalence of MDR. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of drug resistance decreased despite high initial levels of resistance to isoniazid and streptomycin and despite the absence of second-line treatment. Therefore, a DOTS program can contain drug-resistant TB in this settin...|$|R
5|$|The main stem of Darby Creek is {{designed}} as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery from its source to the Pennsylvania Route 3 bridge. From that point downstream to its mouth, the non-tidal portions of the creek's main stem are a Trout Stocked Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Numerous fish species <b>were</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> the creek during a 2009 electrofishing survey by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. The catch per unit effort per hour rate for smallmouth bass was slightly over 10 and the rate for rock bass was under 10. The catch per unit effort per hour rate for redbreast sunfish was 123, the highest of several warmwater streams tested during the survey. Some stocked rainbow trout and brown trout were also captured in the creek. High numbers of American eels <b>were</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> the creek was well. Fish species such as mummichogs, silvery minnows, striped bass, and white perch were found at the head-of-tide of the creek. Brown trout naturally reproduce in the creek's headwaters.|$|E
5|$|Triton's {{rotation}} is tidally locked to be synchronous {{with its}} orbit around Neptune: it keeps one face oriented toward the planet at all times. Its equator is almost exactly aligned with its orbital plane. At the present time, Triton's rotational axis is about 40° from Neptune's orbital plane, and hence {{at some point}} during Neptune's year each pole points fairly close to the Sun, almost like the poles of Uranus. As Neptune orbits the Sun, Triton's polar regions take turns facing the Sun, resulting in seasonal changes as one pole, then the other, moves into the sunlight. Such changes <b>were</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> 2010.|$|E

5|$|Across {{languages}} and letters, the average {{probability of a}} letter being chosen {{as one of the}} six preferred letters was 0.30 for name letters and 0.20 for other letters.

The effect was also found when only looking at letters in family names, as well as only first name letters. The name-letter effect emerged as very significant in all languages when only initials were considered. There was a probability of 0.46 that initial letters were chosen amongst the top-six letters. Further analysis revealed that the overall name-letter effect is not simply due to initials: when excluding initials a name-letter effect was still found across all languages.|$|E
5|$|Decline in age, size during sexual {{maturity}} in {{great northern tilefish}} population is occurring throughout the continental shelf.

The recent estimates of age and size at maturity in the southern U.S. waters were smaller than those previously reported in the late 1980s. There were also very few juvenile tilefish seen in tilefish population surveys in the southern U.S. waters in both the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. Declines in population could negatively affect other organisms in their surrounding environment {{due to the fact}} that without tilefish, the burrows underneath the continental shelf will disappear, therefore putting an end to the symbiotic relationship with other organisms that use the tunnels as shelter.|$|E

Nineteen of the patients (54. 3 %) underwent videonystagmography. Results: Diabetic autonomic neuropathy <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> 28 patients (80 %). A mild degree of autonomic failure <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> 18 patients (64. 3 %), and a moderate degree of autonomic failure <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> ten patients (35. 7 %). Factors related to DAN included diabetic nephropathy (P= 0. 032), degree of chronic kidney disease (P= 0. 003), and duration of diabetes (P= 0. 044).
