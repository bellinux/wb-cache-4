5|$|An {{individual}} mandate {{coupled with}} subsidies for private insurance {{as a means}} for universal healthcare was considered the best way to win the support of the Senate because it had been included in prior bipartisan reform proposals. The concept goes back to at least 1989, when the conservative The Heritage Foundation proposed an individual mandate as an alternative to single-payer health care. It was championed for a time by conservative economists and Republican senators as a market-based approach to healthcare reform on the basis of individual responsibility and avoidance of free rider problems. Specifically, because the 1986 Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) requires any hospital participating in Medicare (nearly all do) to provide emergency care to anyone <b>who</b> <b>needs</b> it, the government often indirectly bore the cost of those without the ability to pay.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to understand the state of long-term care service use by individuals certified as requiring lower care and, from the viewpoint of their relationship with society, to clarify why individuals do not use services. A questionnaire using un-named, individually filled-in forms via mailing was administered targeting 2, 355 elderly people who maintain an at home lifestyle and receive approved Needing support 1 and 2 and Long-term care 1 and 2. We have received the following results. ① Participants not using had higher IADL scores. Also, the group <b>who</b> <b>need</b> support showed a significantly higher rate in living alone, and the group <b>who</b> <b>need</b> long-term care had a lower average age and showed a significantly higher rate in residency of 10 years or more. ② The group <b>who</b> <b>need</b> support responded, “Having discussion with family members” while the group <b>who</b> <b>need</b> longterm care responded, “no discussion with family members and other people. ” Thereby, showing a relation to unused long-term care service. From the above results, we have determined that the group <b>who</b> <b>need</b> support and the group <b>who</b> <b>need</b> long-term care have different backgrounds, revealing the possibility that the groups require separate support measures. Moreover, there is a possibility that those not using but belonging to the group <b>who</b> <b>need</b> long-term care may be isolated from family and neighbors. Hence it may be required to create a mechanism in which we can gain an understanding of their situation and build an individual relationship with them through house-calls, etc...|$|R

Tara, who has gone through the ordeal before, represents the acceptance phase, soothing and helping the others to work through what they are experiencing.
