The person who submits a record {{is the owner of}} it. All records are validated before being made public and BIND is curated for quality assurance. BIND curation has two tracks: high-throughput (HTP) and low-throughput (LTP). HTP records are from papers <b>which</b> <b>have</b> <b>reported</b> more than 40 interaction results from one experimental methodology. HTP curators typically have a bioinformatics backgrounds. The HTP curators are responsible for the collection of storage of experimental data and they also create scripts to update BIND based on new publications. LTP records are curated by individuals with either an MSc or PhD and laboratory experience in interaction research. LTP curators are given further training through the Canadian Bioinformatics Workshops. Information on small molecule chemistry is curated separately by chemists to ensure the curator is knowledgeable about the subject. The priority for BIND curation is to focus on LTP to collect information as it is published. Although, HTP studies provide more information at once, there are more LTP studies being reported and similar numbers of interactions are being reported by both tracks. In 2004, BIND collected data from 110 journals.|$|E

5000|$|Linked {{processing}} {{of the data}} for housing allowances and for sickness insurance {{has taken place in}} Sweden since 1979. This has created, in the words of Eckart Kuhlborn, [...] "a crime prevention eldorado" [...] by making it possible to identify households <b>which</b> <b>have</b> <b>reported</b> different incomes. A check of 70% of the households that received both kinds of payments showed that 2.7% had cheated by giving false information about their incomes. The next year, the figure had decreased to 1.2%. As the check was discussed in the mass media before it was executed the first year, recipients of housing allowances may have been aware of the risk with cheating, so a higher level of fraud before the check - and a greater preventive effect - cannot be ruled out. Neither can it be known how many were smart enough to under-report their income to all the relevant bodies (although under-reporting incomes to sickness insurance authorities would mean a smaller dole in case of sickness).|$|E

He is known to have pioneered the study of molecular self-assembly in India and is credited with {{the creation of a new}} category of self-assembled materials that are functionally soft. His work assisted in the design of larger molecular structures using self-assembling molecules and demonstrated ways to control their electricity conductivity through controlling external factors like temperature <b>which</b> <b>have</b> <b>reported</b> use in applications involving light harvesting, sensing, imaging and security. He was the first scientist to design functional Phenylenevinylene-based Organogels from designed building blocks, which has been detailed in his article, First Phenylenevinylene Based Organogels:  Self-Assembled Nanostructures via Cooperative Hydrogen Bonding and π-Stacking, published in 2001. One of the commercial applications of his researches is secret writing, thermally writable, non-copyable, and erasable fluorescent images useful for secret documentation by using a fluorescent gelator entrapped in a polystyrene film and the process has been developed by his team. His studies have been documented in several peer-reviewed articles; ResearchGate and Google Scholar, online repositories of scientific articles, have listed 202 and 162 of them respectively.

30|$|This {{observational}} study found survival was better {{in patients with}} TNBC who received chemotherapy, and best following surgery plus chemotherapy, compared with other treatments. This may be partly due to previously reported favourable responses to chemotherapy in TNBC. However, patients with a better prognosis {{may also have been}} {{more likely to have been}} selected into receiving more aggressive treatment, and this should be taken into consideration when interpreting the survival results. This study also found that the 5 -year overall survival rate for patients with TNBC was 62 %, compared to 75 % in patients without TNBC. This is comparable with several publications <b>which</b> <b>have</b> <b>reported</b> an overall 5 -year survival of between 59 - 77 % in patients with triple negative disease (Schwentner et al. 2012; Ovcaricek et al. 2011; Chu et al. 2012; Dent et al. 2007). Our findings also corroborate the previously reported poorer prognosis of patients with TNBC compared with patients without TNBC (Liedtke et al. 2008; Schwentner et al. 2012; Ovcaricek et al. 2011; Wu et al. 2011), even after adjusting for possible confounding factors (Wu et al. 2011; Schwentner et al. 2012; Von Minckwitz & Martin 2012).
