Also rolled out in 2005 {{was the creation of}} the 'Automated Test Bay' this differs from traditional testing by adding additional equipment to the bay to negate the use of an assistant during the test; 2012 – checks of secondary restraint systems, battery and wiring, ESC, speedometers and steering locks.|$|E

2500|$|The first verifiable {{claim for}} a {{practically}} used bicycle belongs to German Baron Karl von Drais, a civil servant to the Grand Duke of Baden in Germany. [...] Drais invented his Laufmaschine (German for [...] "running machine") in 1817, that was called Draisine (English) or draisienne (French) by the press. Karl von Drais [...] patented this design in 1818, {{which was the}} first commercially successful two-wheeled, steerable, human-propelled machine, commonly called a velocipede, and nicknamed hobby-horse or dandy horse. It was initially manufactured in Germany and France. Hans-Erhard Lessing (Drais' biographer) found from circumstantial evidence that Drais' interest in finding an alternative to the horse was the starvation and death of horses caused by crop failure in 1816, the Year Without a Summer following the volcanic eruption of Tambora in 1815). [...] On his first reported ride from Mannheim on June 12, 1817, he covered 13km (eight miles) in less than an hour. Constructed almost entirely of wood, the draisine weighed 22kg (48 pounds), had brass bushings within the <b>wheel</b> <b>bearings,</b> iron shod wheels, a rear-wheel brake and 152mm (6inches) of trail of the front-wheel for a self-centering caster effect. [...] This design was welcomed by mechanically minded men daring to balance, and several thousand copies were built and used, primarily in Western Europe and in North America. Its popularity rapidly faded when, partly due to increasing numbers of accidents, some city authorities began to prohibit its use. However, in 1866 Paris a Chinese visitor named Bin Chun could still observe foot-pushed velocipedes.|$|E

50|$|In 1974, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in {{collaboration}} with the Swiss watch industry standards organization NIHS: Normes de l'Industrie Horlogère Suisse published a standard, ISO 1112, which prohibited manufacturers from including such nonfunctional jewels in the jewel counts in advertising and sales literature. This put a stop to the use of totally nonfunctional jewels. However, some experts say manufacturers have continued to inflate the jewel count of their watches by 'upjeweling'; adding functional jeweled bearings to wheels that do not really need them, exploiting loopholes in ISO 1112. Examples given include adding capstones to third and fourth <b>wheel</b> <b>bearings,</b> jeweling minute <b>wheel</b> <b>bearings,</b> and automatic winding ratchet pawls. Arguably none of these additions adds to the accuracy or longevity of the watch.|$|E
