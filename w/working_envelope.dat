40|$|The {{balancing}} of weld {{work load}} between executing stations and its robots {{has a significant}} influence on achievable production rate and equipment utilization. However, no automatic simulation based method for line balancing has been formulated up to this point. In practice, it is still manually conducted. Therefore in this work we propose two novel methods for load balancing of welds in multi station sheet metal assembly lines to minimize line cycle time. The methods are based on superimposition of the scenes/geometries of all line stations, with maintained robot positioning relative to the work piece, creating a "multi station". The weld load is balanced between all multi station robots, whereupon the individual robots are combined into stations and coordinated station wise for simultaneous operation. Furthermore one of the proposed methods reduces the subsequent need for robot coordination, by introducing some restrictions on the load balancing: Firstly, for each robo t, the weld load is balanced over the other station robots such that the <b>working</b> <b>envelopes</b> are maximally separated. Secondly, for each robot, the weld load is balanced over equivalently positioned robots in other line stations, based on previous station load balancing techniques. The proposed line balancing methods are applied on two industrial case studies which each involves the balancing of about 200 automotive stud welds between 3 stations, each of 4 robots. One of the proposed methods produces line cycle times close {{to that of the}} slowest uncoordinated robot, which can be considered a theoretical optimum of the line cycle time.

40|$|This design {{analysis}} has shown that, on a conceptual level, the emplacement of drip shields is feasible with current technology and equipment. A plan for drip shield emplacement was presented using a Drip Shield Transporter, a Drip Shield Emplacement Gantry, a locomotive, and a Drip Shield Gantry Carrier. The {{use of a}} Drip Shield Emplacement Gantry as an emplacement concept results {{in a system that}} is simple, reliable, and interfaces with the numerous other exising repository systems. Using the Waste Emplacement/Retrieval System design as a basis for the drip shield emplacement concept proved to simplify the system by using existing equipment, such as the gantry carrier, locomotive, Electrical and Control systems, and many other systems, structures, and components. Restricted <b>working</b> <b>envelopes</b> for the Drip Shield Emplacement System require further consideration and must be addressed to show that the emplacement operations can be performed as the repository design evolves. Section 6. 1 describes how the Drip Shield Emplacement System may use existing equipment. Depending on the length of time between the conclusion of waste emplacement and the commencement of drip shield emplacement, this equipment could include the locomotives, the gantry carrier, and the electrical, control, and rail systems. If the exisiting equipment is selected for use in the Drip Shield Emplacement System, then the length of time after the final stages of waste emplacement and start of drip shield emplacement may pose a concern for the life cycle of the system (e. g., reliability, maintainability, availability, etc.). Further investigation should be performed to consider the use of existing equipment for drip shield emplacement operations. Further investigation will also be needed regarding the interfaces and heat transfer and thermal effects aspects. The conceptual design also requires further design development. Although the findings of this analysis are accurate for the assumptions made, further refinements of this analysis are needed as the project parameters change.

40|$|Abstract – In contemplating mesh-based networking, some {{operators}} {{have expressed}} concern about the possible effects of span maintenance actions on network restorability, and hence availability. We consider this problem for span-restorable networks and provide two main advances. One is a bi-criteria optimization method that allows a controlled trade-off between the cost of spare capacity and the reduction of restorability risk, through enhancement of the ability to roll to protection on the same span without exporting any working flow onto other spare channels of the network as a whole. The second approach directly designs the spare capacity of a span-restorable network so that it is 100 % immune to risk of restorability loss due to maintenance actions. This approach is mathematically similar to the problem of designing for 100 % restorability for dual-failure scenarios but requires significantly less additional capacity. The maintenance immune design concept can easily be adapted to provide maintenance immunity for priority service paths only. Other desirable side-effects of the spare capacity additions for maintenance immunity are further enhancement of the actual dual-failure restorability levels and further expansion of the protected <b>working</b> capacity <b>envelope</b> provided for dynamic service path provisioning. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – We {{propose a}} {{relatively}} simple extension to current methods for span-based restoration or protection. The extension allows these methods to be designed to deal with node failures, as well as span failures, while retaining most of the locality of operation of span-oriented methods. Other shared protection schemes that cope with node as well as span failures are all end-to-end path replacement schemes that cannot act as quickly and have lower availability than “close-in ” span restoration. The key idea is the extension of span restoration concepts to operate between custodial node regions, instead of between the two traditional custodial nodes. These regions are defined as “one hop removed ” from the node or span failure. We outline the operational concept and the corresponding capacity design models. Results show that the method is almost as capacity-efficient as the best end-to-end schemes, but still operates in the network region close to the failure. Such localization of response is attractive for optical path engineering reasons, speed of activation and response, and dual-failure availability. In addition, because the new approach protects working channels, not end-to-end paths per se, it {{is compatible with the}} concept of a “protected <b>working</b> capacity <b>envelope</b> ” for simplified and highly scalable provisioning of dynamic demands. This avoids the dependency on global databases of sharability data to support dynamic path provisioning. Instead, a traffic-engineered pool of protected working channels supports provisioning of protected (or non-protected) services simply by shortest path routing through the <b>envelope</b> of protected <b>working</b> capacity. 1...|$|R

Potential envelope materials for halide working fluids include pure aluminum, aluminum alloys, commercially pure (CP) titanium, titanium alloys, and corrosion resistant superalloys. Life tests were conducted with three halides (AlBr 3, SbBr 3, and TiCl 4) and water in three different envelopes: two aluminum alloys (Al- 5052, Al- 6061) and Cp- 2 titanium. The AlBr 3 attacked the grain boundaries in the aluminum envelopes, and formed TiAl compounds in the titanium.

UCD MNRC has a sound base of research and industrial partnerships. Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA. approached UCD MNRC with the need to image the condition of brushes contained in motors used in their space related projects. JPL explained that they were unable to see what they needed to see with X-rays. They wanted to know if we could see the carbon brushes in these motors. Using their samples, we initially performed two computed radiography (CR) shots 90 degrees apart through the diameter. Furthermore, another shot along the rotational axis was taken. The brushes could not be seen in the shot along the axis. The exposures through the diameter showed an inconsistency between the two motors’ brushes. We then performed neutron computed tomography (CT) on both motors with one degree projection. Reconstruction clearly showed that the motor with the inconsistent shape brushes had the brushes installed incorrectly. There is a significant difference in both time and cost between CR and CT of the motors. CR took about 30 minutes from beginning of the set up to the complete evaluation, while CT took about five hours to finish.

The {{objective of this}} study is the development of sensor solutions that facilitate autonomous or remote guidance of underwater vehicles in close proximity to marine platforms, the seafloor or other hazards. In particular, this study addresses the need for improved sensing within the <b>working</b> <b>envelope</b> of intervention class vehicles. A literature review of the state-of-the-art in collision avoidance sensors identifies a number of performance and design shortfalls with currently available sensors as applied to intervention class UUVs and AUVs generally.

The sensor developed tested and evaluated provides a low-cost solution based on ultrasonic sensing principles.

40|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} applications that could use heat pipes or loop heat pipes (LHPs) in the intermediate temperature range of 450 to 725 K (170 to 450 C), including space nuclear power system radiators, fuel cells, and high temperature electronics cooling. Historically, water has been used in heat pipes at temperatures up to about 425 K (150 C). Recent life tests, updated below, demonstrate that titanium/water and Monel/water heat pipes can be used at temperatures up to 550 K (277 C), due to water's favorable transport properties. At temperatures above roughly 570 K (300 C), water is no longer a suitable fluid, due to high vapor pressure and low surface tension as the critical point is approached. At higher temperatures, another working fluid/envelope combination is required, either an organic or halide working fluid. An electromotive force method was used to predict the compatibility of halide <b>working</b> fluids with <b>envelope</b> materials. This procedure was used to reject aluminum and aluminum alloys as envelope materials, due to their high decomposition potential. Titanium and three corrosion resistant superalloys were chosen as envelope materials. Life tests were conducted with these envelopes and six different working fluids: AlBr 3, GaCl 3, SnCl 4, TiCl 4, TiBr 4, and eutectic diphenyl/diphenyl oxide (Therminol VP- 1 /Dowtherm A). All of the life tests except for the GaCl 3 are ongoing; the GaCl 3 was incompatible. As the temperature approaches 725 K (450 C), cesium is a potential heat pipe working fluid.
