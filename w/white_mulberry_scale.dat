40|$|Severe infections of <b>white</b> <b>mulberry</b> feeder {{roots and}} heavy soil infestations by Meloidogyne arenaria race 2 {{were found in}} {{southern}} Spain. This is the first record of M. arenaria on <b>white</b> <b>mulberry</b> in Europe. Morphometric observations, analysis of the esterase electrophoretic pattern, and artificial inoculations of race differentials were used to characterize nematodes. Nematode-induced mature galls were spherical and usually contained one or more females, males, and egg masses with eggs. Feeding sites were characterized {{by the development of}} giant cells that contained granular cytoplasm and many hypertrophied nuclei. Giant cell cytoplasm was aggregated along a thickened cell wall. Vascular tissues within galls appeared disorganized. The relationship between the initial nematode population density (Pi) in a series from 0 to 1, 024 eggs and juveniles/cm 3 soil and growth of <b>white</b> <b>mulberry</b> seedlings was tested in the greenhouse. A Seinhorst model was fitted to plant height and top fresh weight. Tolerance limits of <b>white</b> <b>mulberry</b> to M. arenaria race 2 for plant height and top fresh weight were, respectively, 1. 1 and 1. 38 eggs and juveniles/cm 3 soil. The minimum relative values for plant height and top fresh weight were 0 at Pi > 64 and Pi > 128 eggs and juveniles/cm 3 soil, respectively.

40|$|International audienceWe examine in {{this study}} the {{possibility}} of using biodiesel industry waste mixed with urban sewage sludge as a source of nutrients for the production and seedling development in agriculture. Biodiesel industry waste is diatomaceous earth (DE) compounds and paraffin. We added DE with urban sewage sludge. The advantage of this operation is to eliminate the two wastes, residues of the biodiesel industry and sludge from wastewater treatment plants. We studied the behavior of Camaldulensis Eucalyptus and <b>white</b> <b>mulberry</b> (Morus Alba Yu vc- 62). The Dickson Quality Index (DQI) of <b>White</b> <b>Mulberry</b> and Camaldulensis Eucalyptus plants tested in different substrates (urban sewage sludge and DE) are all above the minimum recommended value of 0. 2. The Camaldulensis Eucalyptus and <b>white</b> <b>mulberry</b> (Morus Alba) plants have good growth in substrates containing urban sewage sludge and diatomaceous earth compared to commercial substrate used as control.

40|$|Abstract: Desorption isotherms for <b>white</b> <b>mulberry</b> leaves {{have been}} measured. A {{non-linear}} regression program {{was used to}} fit four moisture sorption isotherm models to the experimental data. The Modified Henderson and Modified Halsey models gave the best fit for X e = f(RH e, T) and RH e = f(X e, T),respectively. Tray and heat pump dehumidified drying experiments of <b>white</b> <b>mulberry</b> leaves were conducted. The convective drying curves of tray and heat pump dehumidified drying for <b>white</b> <b>mulberry</b> leaves were determined and fitted by four models. The Modified Page model was found more effective. The drying constant was fitted to drying air temperature using Arrhenius model. Effective moisture diffusivities were determined using the drying data. 2 2 These values were in the range 1. 032 E- 10 to 2. 611 E- 10 m /s and 1. 496 E- 10 to 2. 705 E- 10 m /s for tray and heat pump dehumidified drying respectively.

40|$|In this study, {{different}} {{techniques are}} used to evaluate sustainable land use in Hop Son hamlet in Bavi district, Hatay Province, Northern Vietnam. First, five cultivation systems including cassava (Manihot esculenta), <b>white</b> <b>mulberry</b> (Morus alba) and Flemingia macrophylla were characterized and their effect on soil properties in a field trial at the Goat and Rabbit Research Centre (GRRC) were evaluated. Secondly, field observations were performed and soil profile descriptions were made in Hop Son hamlet {{in order to understand}} soil properties and the present land use in the area. Moreover, the plants, water erosion modeling and land evaluation were considered in a literature survey. Finally, soil loss simulations were performed with the GLEAMS model and a characterization of the topography in Hop Son area was visualized with GIS software. No significant differences could be found in soil properties between the cultivation systems. The chemical status of the soil and the wet stability of soil aggregates seemed to be similar in all the cultivation systems, with a tendency for higher total nitrogen content in soil with pure stands of F. macrophylla and stronger wet soil aggregate stability in the monocropped systems with F. macrophylla and <b>white</b> <b>mulberry.</b> Observations of root penetration through the soil profiles indicated that F. macrophylla and <b>white</b> <b>mulberry</b> produce more roots that are more widely distributed than those of cassava. Hop Son hamlet was in a hilly and mountainous landscape prone to erosion and the soil was mainly classified as an Acrisol, partly with high levels of aluminum saturation. Wet soil aggregate stability differed considerably between different land uses in the hamlet. Cassava is regularly cultivated within the village and is the most important crop, together with rice. F. macrophylla was introduced to the village during 2001 and some rows of plants have been established in the fields, whereas only one or two plants of <b>white</b> <b>mulberry</b> are grown in home gardens. There is no immediate interest in establishing <b>white</b> <b>mulberry</b> on a larger scale. The GLEAMS model simulated large soil losses from cassava cultivations. These showed pronounced soil loss differences from F. macrophylla cultivations and forest. F. macrophylla cultivations showed higher soil losses than forest. Intense rains proved to be several times more severe regarding soil loss than ordinary precipitation. Sloping characteristics of the area were visualized based on a digital elevation map and land evaluation was estimated on the basis of tolerable soil losses due to cultivation systems and steepness of slopes...|$|R
