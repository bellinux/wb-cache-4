5|$|Treloar {{returned}} to the AWM on 2September 1946 and was formally discharged from the Army in 1947. At the time he believed {{he was suffering from}} bad health, but wanted to resume his work at the Memorial rather than enter hospital. While Clarissa Treloar remained in Melbourne, their daughter Dawn moved to Canberra and took up a position in the Memorial's library. Treloar continued to work long hours in the years after the war. He lived in a cubby hole next to his office and signed the attendance book while walking from bed to his desk. Bean later claimed that Treloar had personally managed all areas of the Memorial other than its library. While Dawn provided him with company, family members and AWM staff believed that Treloar <b>was</b> <b>lonely</b> and did not have a social life. His letters to the official artists engaged by the AWM were frequently relaxed, however, and he became friends with Leslie Bowles and William Dargie. While Treloar was a teetotaler and non-smoker, he occasionally shared wine and cigarettes with Dargie.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1957, Stompanato visited Turner in England, where she was filming Another Time, Another Place (1958), co-starring Sean Connery. In her autobiography, Turner said that she {{arranged}} for Stompanato's visit because she <b>was</b> <b>lonely</b> and having a difficult time filming. Their reunion was initially happy, but the two soon began fighting. Stompanato became suspicious when Turner would not allow him to visit the set and, during one fight, he choked her, causing her to miss three weeks of filming. Turner later wrote {{that she and her}} makeup man, Del Armstrong, called Scotland Yard in order to have Stompanato deported. Stompanato got wind of the plan and showed up on the set with a gun, threatening her and her co-star Sean Connery, whom he warned to keep away from Turner. Connery answered by grabbing the gun out of Stompanato's hand and twisting his wrist, causing him to run off the set sheepishly. Turner and Armstrong later returned with two Scotland Yard detectives to the rented house where she and Stompanato were staying. The detectives advised Stompanato to leave and escorted {{him out of the house}} and also to the airport, where he boarded a plane back to the United States.|$|E
25|$|After {{spending}} {{a year in}} Virginia, the novelty {{of being in a}} new place wore off, and Latrobe <b>was</b> <b>lonely</b> and restless in Virginia. Giambattista Scandella, a friend, suggested Philadelphia as an ideal location for him. In April 1798, Latrobe visited Philadelphia for the first time, meeting with Bank of Pennsylvania president Samuel J. Fox, and presented to him a design for a new bank building. At the time, the political climate in Philadelphia was quite different than Virginia, with a strong division between the Federalists and Jefferson's Democratic-Republicans, along with anti-French sentiment, thus the city was not entirely welcoming for Latrobe. On his way to Philadelphia, Latrobe passed through the national capital city of Washington, D.C., then under construction (congress and the president would not arrive until the year 1800), where he met with the first architect of the capitol, William Thornton, and viewed the United States Capitol for the first time. He stopped by Washington again {{on his way back to}} Richmond. Latrobe remained in Richmond, Virginia, until November 1798, when his design was selected for the Bank of Pennsylvania. He moved to Philadelphia, so that he could supervise the construction, although he continued to do occasional projects for clients in Virginia.|$|E

500|$|On July 25, 1960, Hemingway and Mary left Cuba, {{never to}} return. During {{the summer of}} 1960, {{he set up a}} small office in his New York City {{apartment}} and attempted to work. He left New York City for good soon after. He then traveled alone to Spain to be photographed for the front cover for the Life magazine piece. A few days later, he was reported in the news to be seriously ill and on the verge of dying, which panicked Mary until she received a cable from him telling her, [...] "Reports false. Enroute Madrid. Love Papa." [...] However, he was seriously ill and believed himself {{to be on the verge}} of a breakdown. He <b>was</b> <b>lonely</b> and took to his bed for days, retreating into silence, despite having had the first installments of The Dangerous Summer published in Life in September 1960 to good reviews. In October, he left Spain for New York, where he refused to leave Mary's apartment on the pretext that he was being watched. She quickly took him to Idaho, where George Saviers (a Sun Valley physician) met them at the train.|$|E

500|$|Alfred {{intended}} to give his son the same education he himself had received. At age nine, Edward {{was sent to a}} day school in Philadelphia and in 1853 at the age of 12, Edward was sent to the Friends' Boarding School at Westtown, near West Chester, Pennsylvania. The school was founded in 1799 with fundraising by members of the Society of Friends (Quakers), and provided much of the Cope family's education. The prestigious school was expensive, costing Alfred $500 in tuition each year, and in his first year, Edward studied algebra, chemistry, scripture, physiology, grammar, astronomy, and Latin. Edward's letters home requesting a larger allowance show he was able to manipulate his father, and he was, according to author and Cope biographer Jane Davidson, [...] "a bit of a spoiled brat". His letters suggest he <b>was</b> <b>lonely</b> at the school—it {{was the first time he}} had been away from his home for an extended period. Otherwise, Edward's studies progressed much like a typical boy—he consistently had [...] "less than perfect" [...] or [...] "not quite satisfactory" [...] marks for conduct from his teachers, and did not work hard on his penmanship lessons, which may have contributed to his often illegible handwriting as an adult.|$|E
500|$|The {{title track}} {{incorporates}} a sped-up sample of Gloria Gaynor's [...] "Casanova Brown", {{with an emphasis}} on the line [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>lonely</b> and naïve" [...] from the sample. [...] "Running" [...] has Scott-Heron's spoken word vocals scattered and repeated. [...] "Ur Soul and Mine" [...] samples the vocals from Rui da Silva's house classic [...] "Touch Me", distorting the vocals in the song's verse, but retaining its refrain. The densely produced [...] "Home" [...] features clattering snares, a heavily reverbed keyboard sample, a drum loop, and a vocal sample of Scott-Heron singing the line [...] "home is where the hatred is...", taken from the song of the same name from his 1971 album Pieces of a Man. BBC Online's Ele Beattie said that Jamie xx's sampling [...] "tunes the listener {{in and out of his}} musical predecessors. He rewires a personal musical canon into something utterly contemporary". Robert Christgau characterizes Scott-Heron's original narratives as those of [...] "a drug fiend of considerable perversity and tremendous intelligence who's gonna be dead soon", and comments that Jamie xx [...] "hears in [...] last testament an irreversible disintegration that he translates into heavily sampled minimalist electro marked indelibly by Scott-Heron's weariness, arrogance, and wit." ...|$|E

[...] His columns have also been published in Slate and Newsweek. Since May 2005 he has been a contributing blogger at The Huffington Post. Shearer has written three books. Man Bites Town, published in 1993, is a collection of columns that he wrote for The Los Angeles Times between 1989 and 1992. Published in 1999, It's the Stupidity, Stupid analyzed the hatred some people had for then-President Bill Clinton. Shearer believes that Clinton became disliked because he had an affair with [...] "the least powerful, least credentialed women cleared into his official compound." [...] His most recent book is Not Enough Indians, his first novel. Published in 2006, it is a comic novel about Native Americans and gambling. Without the [...] "pleasures of collaboration" [...] and [...] "spontaneity and improvisation which characterize his other projects", Not Enough Indians was a [...] "struggle" [...] for Shearer to write. He said that [...] "the only fun thing about it was having written it. It <b>was</b> <b>lonely,</b> I had no deal for it and it took six years to do. It was a profoundly disturbing act of self-discipline." ...|$|E

[...] She alleged that in October 1930, while Brownlee was driving her home after one such visit, the premier took her hand and asked her what she knew [...] "about life". [...] On her {{response}} that she knew probably as much as any girl of eighteen, he invited her out the next evening for what she presumed would be some advice. [...] Instead, he drove her [...] west of town on Highway 16 and parked on a side road before asking her to have sex with him. [...] He said that he had been madly in love with her from the start, that he <b>was</b> <b>lonely,</b> {{that he and his wife}} had not lived together as man and wife in a long time, that his wife (an invalid) would be endangered by a pregnancy, and that he could not be premier any longer unless MacMillan agreed to have sex with him. [...] He told her that if she refused him, he would be forced to resume his sexual relationship with his wife, and that this would likely kill her. [...] MacMillan reacted fearfully, and asked if there was anything else she could do to help Brownlee and his wife; he replied that there was not.|$|E

Thus to resolve this apparent discrepancy, some medieval rabbis suggested that Eve from the second account, and the woman of the Elohim account, were two separate individuals: Eve and Lilith.|$|E

The passage {{on the back of the}} book reads [...] "Twelve-year-old Sumiko's life can be divided into two parts: before Pearl Harbor and after it. Before the bombing, although she <b>was</b> <b>lonely,</b> she was used to being the only Japanese American in her class and she always had her family to comfort her. When the government forces all of the Japanese Americans living in California into internment camps, Sumiko soon discovers that the Japanese are just as unwanted on the Mohave reservation they have been shipped to as they were at home. But then she meets a young Mohave boy, who, after initial resentment, becomes her first real friend. Together, they navigate the racial and political challenges of the times, and both help each other understand the true meaning of friendship." ...|$|E

Their relationship is the perfect example of Pederasty. The myth tells how the god of death, who <b>was</b> <b>lonely,</b> saw {{the beauty of the}} moons and desired them, but he had competition. He battled and defeated the other gods and goddess. He romantically pursued the boy moon who resides in the heavens. The god of death ordered the mermaids and birds to sing praises for the boy moon. He also asked the flowers to makes sweet perfumes and nectar for Bulan, and lastly, he gave light to the fireflies so the boy moon could descend to where they could meet. Stories say that Bulan was so fair that the vicious mermaids became gentle and that the fishes and birds forgot to fly and swim. Sidapa took the boy moon to be his child bride and, as legends say and most still natives believe, they reside together sleeping in each other's arms in Mt. Majaas, in the province of Antique ...|$|E
2500|$|The 1920s were {{prolific}} for Onerva, {{but by the}} end of {{the decade}} her health had started to decline. She was intermittently hospitalized for her heart, arthritis, and nerves. Despite her illnesses, in the 1930s Onerva finished her poem collections Yö ja päivä (Night and Day) and Rajalla (On the Border) and a collection of short stories Häistä hautajaisiin (From Wedding to Funeral). In the end of the 1930s, Onerva was transferred to Kivelä Hospital and from there to Veikkola Sanitarium because of her severe alcoholism. In 1942, Onerva was admitted to Nikkilä Mental Hospital. Madetoja's health was in decline at the same time, and he was unable to support his interned wife like before. In hospital, Onerva <b>was</b> <b>lonely</b> and focused on writing poems and started sketching again. During this time, she produced thousands of poems and sketches. Some of these poems were published in a 1945 collection Pursi (Yacht) and four years later in a collection titled Kuilu ja tähdet (Gorge and the Stars). Leevi Madetoja died in 1947, and the next year Onerva was released from the mental hospital with assistance from her friends. The collection of poems Iltarusko (Dusk) from 1952 was her last publication, but she continued to write poems prolifically until her death. [...] Onerva died on 1 March 1972 at the age of 89.|$|E

Charles {{was the son}} of Elisabetta Farnese, who had never forgiven Farinelli for his decision to remain at court after Philip V's death, rather than following her into internal exile. It was clear that Farinelli would now have to leave Spain, though he was allowed a generous state pension. He retired to Bologna, where in 1732 he had acquired a property and citizenship. Though rich and still famous, much feted by local notables and visited by such notable figures as Burney, Mozart and Casanova, he <b>was</b> <b>lonely</b> in his old age, having outlived many of his friends and former colleagues. One distinguished friend of his latter years was the music historian, Giovanni Battista (known as [...] "Padre") Martini. He also continued his correspondence with Metastasio, court poet at Vienna, dying a few months after him. In his will, dated 20 February 1782, Farinelli asked to be buried in the mantle of the Order of Calatrava, and was interred in the cemetery of the Capuchin monastery of Santa Croce in Bologna. His estate included gifts from royalty, a large collection of paintings including works by Velázquez, Murillo and Jusepe de Ribera, as well as portraits of his royal patrons, and several of himself, one by his friend Jacopo Amigoni. He also had a collection of keyboard instruments in which he took great delight, especially a piano made at Florence in 1730 (called in the will [...] ), and violins by Stradivarius and Amati.|$|E
