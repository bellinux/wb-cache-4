500|$|The final {{night of}} {{recording}} {{was held on}} January 28, 1985, at A Recording Studios in Hollywood.

Also in attendance were five of Jackson's siblings: Jackie, LaToya, Marlon, Randy and Tito. Many of the participants came straight from an American Music Award ceremony, which had been held that same night. Invited musician Prince, who {{would have had a}} part in which he and Michael Jackson sang to each other, did not attend the recording session. The reason given for his absence has varied. One newspaper claimed that the singer did not want to record with other acts. Another report, from the time of [...] "We Are the World"'s recording, suggested that the musician did not want to partake in the session because organizer Bob Geldof called him a [...] "creep". Prince did, however, donate an exclusive track, [...] "4 The Tears In Your Eyes", for the <b>We</b> <b>Are</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> album. In all, more than 45 of America's top musicians participated in the recording, and another 50 had to be turned away.
