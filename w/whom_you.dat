5|$|According to Lafcadio Hearn, a {{butterfly}} {{was seen in}} Japan as the personification of a person's soul; whether they be living, dying, or already dead. One Japanese superstition says that if {{a butterfly}} enters your guest room and perches behind the bamboo screen, the person <b>whom</b> <b>you</b> most love is coming to see you. Large numbers of butterflies are viewed as bad omens. When Taira no Masakado was secretly preparing for his famous revolt, there appeared in Kyoto so vast a swarm of butterflies that the people were frightened— thinking the apparition to be a portent of coming evil.|$|E

This is not victory, which is gained over ourselves. In killing these, you drive the sword into your own entrails. How many men have you slaughtered? How many more have you to kill? We have become a proverb, even among the Pagans and Moors, for carrying on this war, and apostatizing, as they say, from the faith of our ancestors.|$|E

25|$|I {{have not}} said {{anything}} about politics today. I don't propose {{to say anything about}} politics. You have a right to elect <b>whom</b> <b>you</b> please; vote for the man you think best, and I think, when that is done, that you and I are freemen. Do as you consider right and honest in electing men for office. I did not come here to make you a long speech, although invited to do so by you. I am not much of a speaker, and my business prevented me from preparing myself. I came to meet you as friends, and welcome you to the white people. I want you to come nearer to us.

Use your best judgment in selecting men for office and vote as you think right.|$|E
25|$|It is such {{a curious}} position, hollow and rotten to the heart’s core, to have made all over the State large uncomfortable {{communities}} of people <b>whom</b> <b>you</b> call refugees and say you are protecting, but who call themselves prisoners of war, compulsorily detained, and detesting your protection. They are tired of being told by officers that they are refugees under “the kind and beneficient protection of the British”. In most cases there is no pretence that there was treachery, or ammunition concealed, or food given or anything. It was just that an order was given to empty the country. Though the camps are called refugee, there are in reality a very few of these–perhaps only half-a-dozen in some camps. It is easy to tell them, because they are put in the best marquees, and have had time given to them to bring furniture and clothes, and are mostly self-satisfied and vastly superior people. Very few, if any of them, are in want.|$|E
500|$|In 1908 Beecham and the New Symphony Orchestra parted company, disagreeing about artistic control and, in particular, {{the deputy}} system. Under this system, orchestral players, if offered a better-paid {{engagement}} elsewhere, could send a substitute to a rehearsal or a concert. [...] The {{treasurer of the}} Royal Philharmonic Society described it thus: [...] "A, <b>whom</b> <b>you</b> want, signs to play at your concert. He sends B (<b>whom</b> <b>you</b> don't mind) to the first rehearsal. B, without your knowledge or consent, sends C to the second rehearsal. Not being able {{to play at the}} concert, C sends D, <b>whom</b> <b>you</b> would have paid five shillings to stay away." [...] Henry Wood had already banned the deputy system in the Queen's Hall Orchestra (provoking rebel players to found the London Symphony Orchestra), and Beecham followed suit. [...] The New Symphony Orchestra survived without him and subsequently became the Royal Albert Hall Orchestra.|$|E

500|$|Creating the {{orchestra}} admired by Strauss {{had not been}} achieved without a struggle. In 1904, Wood and Newman tackled the deputy system, in which orchestral players, if offered a better-paid engagement, could send a substitute to a rehearsal or a concert. The treasurer of the Royal Philharmonic Society described it thus: [...] "A, <b>whom</b> <b>you</b> want, signs to play at your concert. He sends B (<b>whom</b> <b>you</b> don't mind) to the first rehearsal. B, without your knowledge or consent, sends C to the second rehearsal. Not being able {{to play at the}} concert, C sends D, <b>whom</b> <b>you</b> would have paid five shillings to stay away." [...] After a rehearsal in which Wood was faced with a sea of entirely unfamiliar faces in his own orchestra, Newman came on the platform to announce: [...] "Gentlemen, in future there will be no deputies; good morning." [...] Forty players resigned en bloc and formed their own orchestra: the London Symphony Orchestra. Wood bore no grudge and attended their first concert, although it was 12 years before he agreed to conduct {{the orchestra}}.|$|E
500|$|At {{the turn}} of the twentieth century there were no {{permanent}} salaried orchestras in London. The main orchestras were those of Covent Garden, the Philharmonic Society and the Queen's Hall; their proprietors engaged players individually for each concert or for a season. As there were competing demands for the services of the finest players it was an accepted practice that, even though under contract to play for a concert, a player was at liberty to accept a better-paid engagement if it were offered. He would then engage another player to deputise at him for the original concert and the rehearsals for it. The treasurer of the Philharmonic Society described the system thus: [...] "A, <b>whom</b> <b>you</b> want, signs to play at your concert. He sends B (<b>whom</b> <b>you</b> don't mind) to the first rehearsal. B, without your knowledge or consent, sends C to the second rehearsal. Not being able to play at the concert, C sends D, <b>whom</b> <b>you</b> would have paid five shillings to stay away." [...] There was much competition for good orchestral players, with well-paid engagements offered by more than fifty music halls, by pit bands in West End musical comedies, and by grand hotels and restaurants which maintained orchestras.|$|E
500|$|The {{standard}} of orchestral playing in London was {{adversely affected by}} the deputy system, in which orchestral players, if offered a better-paid engagement, could send a substitute to a rehearsal or a concert. The treasurer of the Royal Philharmonic Society described it thus: [...] "A, <b>whom</b> <b>you</b> want, signs to play at your concert. He sends B (<b>whom</b> <b>you</b> don't mind) to the first rehearsal. B, without your knowledge or consent, sends C to the second rehearsal. Not being able {{to play at the}} concert, C sends D, <b>whom</b> <b>you</b> would have paid five shillings to stay away". The members of the Queen's Hall Orchestra were not highly paid; Wood recalled in his memoirs, [...] "the rank and file of the orchestra received only 45s a week for six Promenade concerts and three rehearsals, a guinea for one Symphony concert and rehearsal, and half-a-guinea for Sunday afternoon or evening concerts without rehearsal". Offered ad hoc engagements at better pay by other managements, many of the players took full advantage of the deputy system. Newman determined {{to put an end to}} it. After a rehearsal in which Wood was faced with a sea of entirely unfamiliar faces in his own orchestra, Newman came on the platform to announce: [...] "Gentlemen, in future there will be no deputies; good morning". Forty players resigned en bloc and formed their own orchestra, the London Symphony Orchestra. Newman did not attempt to bar the new orchestra from the Queen's Hall, and its first concert was given there on 9 June 1904, conducted by Richter.|$|E

500|$|Brundage {{believed}} that the boycott controversy could be used effectively for fundraising, writing, [...] "the fact that the Jews are against us will arouse interest among {{thousands of people who}} have never subscribed before, if they are properly approached." [...] In March 1936, he wrote to advertising mogul Albert Lasker, a Jew, complaining that [...] "a large number of misguided Jews still persist in attempting to hamper the activities of the American Olympic Committee. The result, of course, is increased support from the one hundred and twenty million non-Jews in the United States, for this is a patriotic enterprise." [...] In a letter which David Large, in his book on the 1936 Games, terms [...] "heavy-handed", Brundage suggested that by helping to finance American participation in the Olympic Games, Jews could decrease anti-Semitism in the US. However, [...] "Lasker, to his credit, refused to be blackmailed," [...] writing to Brundage that [...] "You gratuitously insult not only Jews but the millions of patriotic Christians in America, for <b>whom</b> <b>you</b> venture to speak without warrant, and <b>whom</b> <b>you</b> so tragically misrepresent in your letter." ...|$|E

Among them was Sally's older brother James Hemings, who became trained as a chef in French cuisine. Jefferson left his two younger daughters in the care of friends in the US. After Lucy died of whooping cough in 1787, Jefferson sent for his surviving daughter, nine-year-old Maria (Polly) Jefferson, to live with him.

500|$|Beginning in 2005, Thompson {{supported}} {{a campaign to}} discourage Take-Two’s subsidiary, Rockstar Games, from releasing a game called Bully, in which, according to Thompson, [...] "what you are in effect doing is rehearsing your physical revenge and violence against those <b>whom</b> <b>you</b> have been victimized by. And then you, like Klebold and Harris in Columbine, become the ultimate bully." [...] According to Thompson, the game [...] "shows you how to—by bullying—take over your school. You punch people; you hit them with sling shots; you dunk their heads in dirty toilets. There's white-on-black crime in the game. You bludgeon teachers and classmates with bats. It's absolutely nuts." [...] Thompson sued Wal-Mart, Best Buy, Target, Circuit City, GameStop, and Toys 'R' Us, seeking an order to bar the game’s release. He also participated in a protest at Rockstar's office that also included students from Peaceaholics, a Washington, D.C. mentoring organization. Thompson said he hoped that the pressure would get retailers to refuse to carry the game. In March 2006, a Florida school board he had lobbied passed a resolution criticizing the game, but only urged retailers not to sell the game to minors.|$|E
