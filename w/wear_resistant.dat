5|$|Cobalt-based {{superalloys}} consume {{most of the}} produced cobalt. The {{temperature stability}} of these alloys makes them suitable for turbine blades for gas turbines and jet aircraft engines, though nickel-based single crystal alloys surpass them in performance. Cobalt-based alloys are also corrosion and wear-resistant, making them (along with titanium) useful in medical orthopedic implants that do not wear down over time. The development of wear-resistant cobalt alloys started {{in the first decade}} of the 20th century with the stellite alloys, containing chromium with varying quantities of tungsten and carbon. Alloys with chromium and tungsten carbides are very hard and <b>wear</b> <b>resistant.</b> Special cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloys like Vitallium are used for prosthetic parts (hip and knee replacements). Cobalt alloys are also used for dental prosthetics as a useful substitute for nickel, which may be allergenic. Some high speed steels also contain cobalt for increased heat and wear-resistance. The special alloys of aluminium, nickel, cobalt and iron, known as Alnico, and of samarium and cobalt (samarium-cobalt magnet) are used in permanent magnets. It is also alloyed with 95% platinum for jewelry, yielding an alloy suitable for fine casting and is also slightly magnetic.|$|E

In its bulk form it is very <b>wear</b> <b>resistant,</b> particularly if oil-impregnated, and so is used to build gears, plain bearings, valve seats, seals and because of good heat-resistance, increasingly for under-the-hood applications in cars, and other mechanical parts.|$|E
25|$|Titanium is a {{metal that}} has a better strength-to-weight ratio, is more <b>wear</b> <b>resistant,</b> and more {{flexible}} than steel. Although less hard and unable to take as sharp an edge, carbides in the titanium alloy {{allow them to be}} heat-treated to a sufficient hardness. Ceramic blades are hard, brittle, and lightweight: they may maintain a sharp edge for years with no maintenance at all, but are as fragile as glass and will break if dropped on a hard surface. They are immune to common corrosion, and can only be sharpened on silicon carbide sandpaper and some grinding wheels. Plastic blades are not especially sharp and typically serrated. They are often disposable.|$|E

25|$|VSI crushers use a {{different}} approach involving a high speed rotor with <b>wear</b> <b>resistant</b> tips and a crushing chamber designed to 'throw' the rock against. The VSI crushers utilize velocity rather than surface force as the predominant force to break rock. In its natural state, rock has a jagged and uneven surface. Applying surface force (pressure) results in unpredictable and typically non-cubical resulting particles. Utilizing velocity rather than surface force allows the breaking force to be applied evenly both {{across the surface of}} the rock as well as through the mass of the rock. Rock, regardless of size, has natural fissures (faults) throughout its structure. As rock is 'thrown' by a VSI Rotor against a solid anvil, it fractures and breaks along these fissures. Final particle size can be controlled by 1) the velocity at which the rock is thrown against the anvil and 2) the distance between the end of the rotor and the impact point on the anvil. The product resulting from VSI Crushing is generally of a consistent cubical shape such as that required by modern SUPERPAVE highway asphalt applications. Using this method also allows materials with much higher abrasiveness to be crushed than is capable with an HSI and most other crushing methods.|$|E

These were quite <b>wear</b> <b>resistant</b> and kept together by cementum and dentine. A mammoth had six sets of molars throughout a lifetime, which were replaced five times, though a few specimens with a seventh set are known. The latter condition could extend the lifespan of the individual, unless the tooth consisted {{of only a few}} plates. The first molars were about the size of those of a human, , the third were 15cm (6in) [...] long, and the sixth were about [...] long and weighed [...] The molars grew larger and contained more ridges with each replacement.

40|$|In Sardinia {{abundant}} granite by-products stockpiles {{deriving from}} {{the processing of}} ornamental granite quarries is becoming an environmental and economic issue. According to the last survey each year {{hundreds of thousands of}} cubic meters of granite by-products are currently discharged. This paper reports about an on going research focused on the evaluation of possible recycle techniques of such materials for road construction purposes using locally available resources. The main goal is to limit the exploitation of natural aggregates normally used in road construction industry, thus contributing to reduction of both energy and environmental loss. Potential applications of granite by-products in road layers were verified from a physical and mechanical point of view. In particular, South African technical procedures for the realization of ultra compacted base layers known as G 1 were studied and reproduced with the benefit of reducing the thickness of the surfacing layers. Preliminary results have shown that granite aggregates are non plastic and with good <b>wearing</b> <b>resistant</b> thus can be safely used for road base and sub-base layers. Still more studies are need in order to reach South African specification...|$|R

40|$|The {{deposition}} of diamond films on a silicon nitride (Si 3 N 4) substrate {{is an attractive}} technique for industrial applications because of the excellent properties of diamond. Diamond possesses remarkable physical and mechanical properties such as chemical resistant,extreme hardness and highly <b>wears</b> <b>resistant.</b> Pretreatment of substrate is very important prior to diamond deposition to promote nucleation and adhesion between coating and substrate. Polycrystalline diamonds films have been deposited on silicon nitride substrate by Hot Filament Chemical Vapor Deposition (HF-CVD) method. The Si 3 N 4 substrates {{have been subjected to}} various pretreatment methods prior to diamond deposition namely chemical etching and mechanical abrasion. The structure and morphology of diamond coating have been studied using X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) while diamond film quality has been characterized using Raman spectroscopy. The adhesion of diamond films has been determined qualitatively by using Vickers hardness tester. It was found that the diamond films formed on chemical pretreated substrates has cauliflower morphology and low adhesive strength but also have low surface roughness. Substrates that pretreated with sand blasting have yield diamond film with well-facetted morphology with high crystallinity and better adhesion. However,the surface roughness of the diamond film deposited on substrates pretreated with blasting are also higher...|$|R

40|$|VTI has {{during a}} {{considerable}} time of years monitored the wear from studded tyres through full-scale tests and control sections. During the winter 2006 - 2007, {{measurements of the}} wear were carried out at several control sections {{in the region of}} Stockholm. The aim of these measurements was to study: - the amount of wear caused by studded tyres on urban streets in Stockholm, - the amount of wear caused by studded tyres on express ways outside Stockholm, - the number of private cars using studded tyres, - the relevance of the wear prediction model when used for urban streets. The result of the study shows that the wear of the asphalt wearing courses on the express ways around Stockholm has increased during the last few years even after compensation with respect to the increased amount of traffic. This means that every vehicle equipped with studded tyres wears away more material {{from the surface of the}} asphalt wearing course. One reason for this is that less <b>wearing</b> <b>resistant</b> aggregates have been used in the wearing courses on the express ways around Stockholm the last few years. Together with an increased amount of traffic it results in deeper wearing ruts compared with the winters in the beginning of this century. The rut depth caused by the traffic with studded tyres was 2 - 3 mm in the winter 2006 / 2007...|$|R
