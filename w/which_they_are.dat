40|$|Sixty {{preschool}} children {{were asked to}} perform either an objectively easy task <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> told was easy for other children, an objectively easy task <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> told was difficult for others, an objectively difficult task <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> told was easy for others, or an objectively difficult task <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> told was difficult. Their level {{of success and failure}} in achievement activity prior to performing this task was manipulated. Results indicated that when the task was either objectively difficult or allegedly difficult for other children, subjects who had failed on a previous task persevered longer than did subjects who had previously succeeded. However, when the task was both objectively easy and apparently easy for others, subjects who had previously been successful persevered longer than subjects who had previously failed. Results were inconsistent with achievement motivation theory (Atkinson, 1957), but were interpretable using an exchange formulation of behavior (Thibaut and Kelley, 1959). © 1967...|$|R
