500|$|Lynsey {{was found}} dead by Brendan Brady (Emmett J. Scanlan). The death sparked a [...] "whodunit storyline" [...] with Mercedes in the frame for her murder. Digital Spy {{explained}} her motives stating, [...] "Mercedes has also become increasingly deranged in recent weeks and wanted to keep Lynsey quiet after she discovered the truth about her stalking of Mitzeee". A promotional image featuring Mercedes was later released by Hollyoaks which confirmed Mercedes as an official suspect in the mystery. Mercedes entered a relationship with Doctor Browning, who had previously paid her for sex, {{in an attempt to}} make Riley jealous. Smithwick told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that she [...] "was nervous about the union of the dark soul mates, Mercy and Browning, but their chemistry is so watchable - that story is pretty dark". Mercedes began to [...] "fall for the charms" [...] of Doctor Browning, believing she had [...] "landed on her feet" [...] when he invited her to a charity ball. Metcalfe commented that Mercedes began to think he could provide her with the WAG life style that she had always wanted. She added that Mercedes still had feelings for Riley and was [...] "being very sneaky" [...] in her attempts to win him back. She explained that Mercedes [...] "still wants Riley back but, as <b>we</b> <b>know,</b> <b>when</b> she has everything she desires, she still craves a bit of danger". Thompson elaborated on this, saying Mercedes [...] "thinks she wants the quiet life with Riley, but Dr Browning offers an exciting alternative for her, he knows what makes her tick, {{and the two of them}} are excited by how dangerous the other is". On Doctor Browning's feelings for Mercedes, Thompson said: [...] "he's fallen for her and will do whatever it takes to be with her. He thinks if he spends enough time with Mercy, he'll win her around". When Doctor Browning witnessed Riley kiss Mercedes [...] "it becomes a question of how much he can take" [...] and he decided he must [...] "make a quick move" [...] to prevent them reuniting. To do this he takes Mercedes to a shooting range, Thompson explained that there she [...] "realises there's an undeniable connection between them". He added that the couple are [...] "kindred spirits" [...] and Mercedes spending time with him made her rethink their relationship. Thompson said [...] "it seemed to be written in the stars that Mercedes and Riley will get back together - but Dr Browning won't let that happen" [...] and to do this he threatened Riley. Thompson claimed that due to Doctor Browning having incriminating evidence showing that Mercedes discharged herself at the time Lynsey was murdered it gives him [...] "real power, she thinks she's in control, but she might just be underestimating Dr Browning..." [...] Metcalfe said that she feels Doctor Browning is Mercedes soul mate, explaining that [...] "he gives as good as he gets and I think that's really good for my character". On who Mercedes loves more out of Doctor Browning and Riley, Metcalfe said [...] "it's Doctor Browning all the way for her, i think he really took her by storm and she absolutely adores him". On 17 August 2012 during E4's first look episode it was revealed Doctor Browning had killed Lynsey. Hollyoaks official website said Doctor Browning's motives in killing Lynsey were [...] "presumably to protect Mercedes".|$|E

60|$|Third, Another {{argument}} {{to prove that}} Jesus is the Christ, is this, By his power the blind see, the lame walk, the deaf hear, the dumb speak, the dead are raised up, the devils are dispossessed. In Isaiah 35:4 it is thus prophesied of him, 'Behold your God will come with vengeance, even God with a recompense; he will come and save you'; But how shall <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>when</b> he is come? Why, 'Then {{the eyes of the}} blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped. Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing; for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert' (vv 5,6). Now when John would know whether he were the Christ or no, Jesus sends him this very answer, 'Go, and shew John [saith he] again those things which you do hear and see: the blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them' (Matt 11:3-5).|$|E
6000|$|The soul is the perceiver and revealer of truth. We know {{truth when}} we see it, let skeptic and scoffer say what they choose. Foolish people ask you, when you have spoken what they {{do not wish to}} hear, 'How do you know it is truth, and not an error of your own?' We know truth {{when we see}} it, from opinion, as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>when</b> we are awake that we are awake. It was a grand {{sentence}} of Emanuel Swedenborg, which would alone indicate the greatness of that man's perception,--"It is no proof of a man's understanding to be able to confirm whatever he pleases; but to be able to discern that what is true is true, and that what is false is false,--this is the mark and character of intelligence." [...] In the book I read, the good thought returns to me, as every truth will, the image of the whole soul. To the bad thought which I find in it, the same soul becomes a discerning, separating sword, and lops it away. We are wiser than we know. If we will not interfere with our thought, but will act entirely, or see how the thing stands in God, we know the particular thing, and every thing, and every man. For the Maker of all things and all persons stands behind us and casts his dread omniscience through us over things.|$|E
