5|$|In {{the history}} of art, the {{original}} Greek authorities are Duris of Samos, Xenocrates of Sicyon, and Antigonus of Carystus. The anecdotic element has been ascribed to Duris (XXXIV:61); the notices of the successive developments {{of art and the}} list of workers in bronze and painters to Xenocrates; and a large amount of miscellaneous information to Antigonus. Both Xenocrates and Antigonus are named in connection with Parrhasius (XXXV:68), while Antigonus is named in the indexes of XXXIII–XXXIV as a writer on the art of embossing metal, or <b>working</b> <b>it</b> in ornamental relief or intaglio.|$|E

25|$|The raw {{material}} {{is an important}} factor, because of the result that {{can be obtained by}} <b>working</b> <b>it</b> and in order to reveal the economy and movement of prehistoric humans. In the Olduvai Gorge the {{raw material}}s were most readily available some ten kilometres from the nearest settlements. However, flint or silicate is readily available on the fluvial terraces of Western Europe. This means that different strategies were required for the procurement and use of available resources. The supply of materials was {{the most important factor in}} the manufacturing process as Palaeolithic artisans were able to adapt their methods to available materials, obtaining adequate results from even the most difficult raw materials. Despite this it is important to study the rock's grain, texture, the presence of joints, veins, impurities or shatter cones etc.|$|E
25|$|It {{was only}} in the early 16th century that the modern idea of the galley slave became commonplace. Galley fleets as well as the size of {{individual}} vessels increase in size, which required more rowers. The number of benches could not be increased without lengthening hulls beyond their structural limits, and more than three oars per bench was not practicable. The demand for more rowers also meant that the relatively limited number of skilled oarsmen could not keep up with the demand of large galley fleets. It became increasingly common to man galleys with convicts or slaves, which required a simpler method of rowing. The older method of employing professional rowers using the alla sensile method (one oar per man, with two to three sharing the same bench) was gradually phased out in favor of rowing a scaloccio, which required less skill. A single large oar was used for each bench, with several rowers <b>working</b> <b>it</b> together and the number of oarsmen per oar rose from three up to five. In some very large command galleys, there could be as many as seven to an oar.|$|E

25|$|Prospecting was {{successful}} and several opencasts are visible below the large tanks built along its length. The only {{exception is the}} final and very large tank, below which are two reservoirs. It is likely that this complex was used for washing powdered ore to collect the gold dust. More leats and tanks can be found below {{the line of the}} main aqueduct, some of which are shown on the map of the site. They surround the lip of the very large opencast and the tank shown at right is one which was built on the main aqueduct. It {{was successful}} in finding a vein, judging by the opencast below, but must have been modified later to feed a washing table built to the left-hand side (near the figure in the picture), probably to wash the crushed ore from the same opencast <b>working.</b> <b>It</b> is labelled Tank C in the schematic diagram. Similar tanks occur below as the Romans followed the large vein down to the road and the main opencast. Most of the opencast workings must therefore be Roman in origin, since one of the aqueducts has been confirmed by carbon 14 dating as to predate all modern workings. Just by the road itself the Carreg Pumsaint has been erected in the space beside a large mound, now thought to be a dump of waste material from mining activities.|$|E
25|$|The Domesday survey {{therefore}} {{recorded the}} names of the new holders of lands and the assessments on which their tax was to be paid. But it did more than this; by the king's instructions, it endeavoured to make a national valuation list, estimating the annual value of all the land in the country, (1) at the time of Edward the Confessor's death, (2) when the new owners received it, (3) {{at the time of the}} survey, and further, it reckoned, by command, the potential value as well. It is evident that William desired to know the financial resources of his kingdom, and it is probable that he wished to compare them with the existing assessment, which was one of considerable antiquity, though there are traces that it had been occasionally modified. The great bulk of Domesday Book is devoted to the somewhat arid details of the assessment and valuation of rural estates, which were as yet the only important source of national wealth. After stating the assessment of the manor, the record sets forth the amount of arable land, and the number of plough teams (each reckoned at eight oxen) available for <b>working</b> <b>it,</b> with the additional number (if any) that might be employed; then the river-meadows, woodland, pasture, fisheries (i.e. fishing weirs), water-mills, salt-pans (if by the sea) and other subsidiary sources of revenue; the peasants are enumerated in their several classes; and finally the annual value of the whole, past and present, is roughly estimated.|$|E
500|$|Baroque pop (sometimes called baroque rock) is {{a fusion}} genre that {{combines}} rock music with particular elements of classical music. It {{emerged in the}} mid 1960s as artists pursued a majestic, orchestral sound and is identifiable for its appropriation of Baroque compositional styles (contrapuntal melodies and functional harmony patterns) and dramatic or melancholic gestures. Harpsichords figure prominently, while oboes, French horns, and string quartets are also common.) Author Joe Harrington noted that after its release, many [...] "baroque-rock" [...] works would soon appear.

500|$|In May 2011, in The Mix Review, an {{analyzing}} commercial productions, Mike Senior of Sound on Sound revisited {{the original}} mixing of the song. According to him, {{before he started}} the mix, Senior played the song {{a couple of times}} before releasing what thing about it [...] "bugged" [...] him. <b>Working</b> <b>it</b> out, he noted that the harmony of the mix is undermined by the kick drum. [...] "What's My Name?" [...] contains basic harmonies that are a bar of F# minor, a bar of A major and two bars of D-major. Senior stated that on the other side however, there's a very little in the arrangement that could be seen like a traditional melodic bass-line. As the result of that, the [...] "808-style" [...] kick-drum's pronounce pitched components with a power of 37Hz and 74Hz fill that help void with a 'D' note. According to Senior, [...] "the problem is that this only really supports the D‑major chord, destabilizing the home chord of F# minor (by implying that it's actually part of a D‑major 7th chord) and clashing nastily with the A‑major." [...] He further stated that although might not be as apparent on small speakers, it still represents [...] "weakness" [...] for him. The section of the song at 3:12 has four bars without the kick-drum and four without it.|$|E

Although neighbouring areas such as Merthyr and Aberdare had already sunk coal mines, it was not until Walter Coffin initiated the Dinas Lower Colliery in 1812 that coal was first exported from the Rhondda Valleys on any sort of commercial scale. This coal was originally taken by packhorse, before the extension of Dr. Griffiths' private tramline, to Pontypridd and then by the Glamorganshire Canal to the port at Cardiff. The lack of any transportation links {{was one of the main}} problems that curtailed exploitation of the Rhondda Valley coal fields, along with the belief that the coalfields beneath the valley were thought to be too deep for economic <b>working.</b> <b>It</b> was therefore seen as an expensive risk and deterred anyone looking for a quick profit. The exploration of the Rhondda was undertaken by the Bute Trustees, agents of the third Marquess of Bute, who not only owned large tracts of valley farmland but also possessed a large financial interest in the Cardiff Docks which would export the coal. The trustees sank the Bute Merthyr Colliery in October 1851, at the top of the Rhondda Fawr in what would become Treherbert. The Bute Merthyr began producing coal in 1855, the first working steam coal colliery in the Rhondda.|$|E
