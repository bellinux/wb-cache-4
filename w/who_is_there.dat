Donna tailspins into a wave of depression and later drunkenly delivers a terrible set in which she insults her ex-boyfriend. Later that night, at the bar, she meets Max (Jake Lacy), <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> with clients but who missed her set. Donna and Max have an instant connection and they end up having sex. In the morning Donna leaves Max's apartment without saying goodbye.|$|E
5|$|An infant with an anxious-avoidant {{pattern of}} {{attachment}} will avoid or ignore the caregiver—showing little emotion when the caregiver departs or returns. The infant will not explore very much regardless of <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>there.</b> Infants classified as anxious-avoidant (A) represented a puzzle {{in the early}} 1970s. They did not exhibit distress on separation, and either ignored the caregiver on their return (A1 subtype) or showed some tendency to approach together with some tendency to ignore or {{turn away from the}} caregiver (A2 subtype). Ainsworth and Bell theorized that the apparently unruffled behaviour of the avoidant infants was in fact a mask for distress, a hypothesis later evidenced through studies of the heart-rate of avoidant infants.|$|E

5|$|As a {{birthday}} gift for Marge, Homer buys a blender designed by television chef Paula Paul. He {{goes to a}} health food store called Swapper Jack's, where Paula is giving away autographs, to have Paula sign it. Homer is impressed by the store and {{says he will not}} be shopping at the Kwik-E-Mart any more. Apu, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> to spy, overhears Homer and the two engage in a fight until the security guards grab hold of Apu and take him away. At the signing, Homer tells Paula that Marge is a big fan of hers. Paula decides that she will call Marge live during her upcoming show to wish her a happy birthday. Meanwhile, Bart gets his mother a rabbit for her birthday. The rabbit chews through the phone lines in the Simpsons' home, causing Marge to miss Paula's call. Paula becomes furious at Marge for not answering the phone as she embarrassed herself on her show. Homer punishes Bart by locking him up in the rabbit's cage.|$|E
5|$|While {{willing to}} accept his death and allow Momohime her {{remaining}} time in her body, Kongiku shows them another way to Heaven. There, Yukinojo appears and reveals {{that he had the}} Dark Resurrection all along. They are then attacked by Fudo-Myoou, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> to deliver divine justice upon Jinkuro. In the first ending, Jinkuro allows himself to be sent to Yomi while Momohime lives; she decides to forgo her marriage to Yukinojo and become a Buddhist nun in the hope of saving Jinkuro's soul through prayer. In the second ending, Momohime and Jinkuro are intercepted by Kisuke and Yuzuruha, resulting in Kongiku being robbed of her human form as punishment for her defiance. Though defeated, Kisuke delivers a fatal wound to Momohime, forcing Jinkuro to merge his soul with Momohime's to save her: this act leaves her an amnesiac but grants her Jinkuro's sword fighting abilities, which become legendary as she travels Japan in search of her missing memories. In the third ending, after the battle with Fudo-Myoou Jinkuro is transported to the night he first attacked Yukinojo and Momohime with the power of the Oboro Muramasa Demon Blade, which can defy the passage of fate. He chooses not to attack them, then later possesses Yukinojo's body and uses that position to ensure Momohime's safety and her family's security. Momohime herself lives to be one hundred years old and bears three children, while Kongiku remains close to Jinkuro {{in the guise of a}} servant.|$|E

25|$|Salvian {{continued}} his friendly intercourse with both father and sons {{long after the}} latter had left his care; it was to Salonius (then a bishop) that he wrote his explanatory letter just {{after the publication of}} his treatise Ad ecclesiam; and to the same prelate a few years later he dedicated his great work, the De gubernatione Dei ("The Government of God"). If French scholars are right in assigning Hilary's Vita Honorati to 430, Salvian, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> called a priest, had probably already left Lyons for Marseilles, where he is known to have spent the last years of his life (Gennadius, ap. Migne, lviii. 1099). It was probably from Marseilles that he wrote his first letter — presumably to Lerins — begging the community there to receive his kinsman, the son of a widow of Cologne, who had been reduced to poverty by the barbarian invasions. It seems a fair inference that Salvian had divested himself of all his property in favour of that society and sent his relative to Lerins for assistance (Ep. i., with which compare Ad eccles. ii. 9, 10; iii. 5). It has been conjectured that Salvian paid a visit to Carthage; but this is a mere inference based on the minute details he gives of the state of this city just before its fall to the Vandals (De gub. vii. viii). He seems to have been still living at Marseilles when Gennadius wrote under the papacy of Gelasius (492-496).|$|E

500|$|The {{same three}} biographers {{comment on the}} {{comparisons}} between Harrison and Dylan that were encouraged by this and other Harrison songs from 1971–73, during a period when, author Peter Doggett writes, the ex-Beatle was [...] "arguably music's most influential figure". Leng views Harrison's call for humility in [...] "The Day the World Gets 'Round" [...] as [...] "identical to the thrust" [...] of Dylan's [...] "Masters of War", a protest song written about the 1962–63 Cold War arms race. Inglis suggests that whereas Dylan adopts the more analytical approach of an observer in his politically themed songs, Harrison [...] "appears as a campaigner <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> to convert"; his words duly carry [...] "a suggestion of self-satisfaction", Inglis opines, while also remarking on the [...] "overall pessimism" [...] of [...] "The Day the World Gets 'Round". Allison contrasts the song with [...] "Slow Train Coming", a lyrically uncompromising Dylan composition reflecting the American singer's late-1970s conversion to born-again Christianity, and cites [...] "The Day the World Gets 'Round" [...] {{as an example of}} how Harrison's worldview instead [...] "entails a happy ending".|$|E

2500|$|According to {{established}} Marvel canon, Ororo Munroe is born in New York City {{as the child}} of Kenyan tribal princess N’Dare and American photographer David Munroe. When Ororo is six months old, she and her parents move to the Egyptian capital of Cairo. Five years later, during the Suez Crisis, a fighter jet crashes into her parents’ house, killing them. [...] Buried under tons of rubble, Ororo survives but is orphaned and left with intense claustrophobia. Her fear was once so intense that she was known to revert to a fetal position and approach a catatonic state. In late 2000s storylines, however, writers like Ed Brubaker and Christopher Yost have indicated that Storm had largely conquered her claustrophobia, and can freely move in tight spaces, even {{over long periods of}} time. After the death of her parents, Ororo wanders Cairo's back-alleys for a few weeks, until she is picked up by the benign street lord Achmed el-Gibar and becomes a prolific thief; among her victims is her future mentor Professor X <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> to meet the Shadow King. Following an inner urge, she wanders into the Serengeti as a teenager and meets T’Challa, who would become her future husband. [...] Despite strong mutual feelings, the two part ways.|$|E
