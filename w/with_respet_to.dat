40|$|The {{object of}} this paper is to {{introduce}} a quarter-symmetric metric connec- tion in a pseudosymmetric Lorentzian a-Sasakian manifold and to study of some properties of it. Also we shall discuss some properties of the Weyl-pseudosymmetric Lorentzian a−Sasakian manifold and Ricci-pseudosymmetric Lorentzian a−Sasakian manifold <b>with</b> <b>respet</b> <b>to</b> quarter-symmetric metric connection. We have given an example of pseudosymmetric Lorentzian a-Sasakian manifold with respect to quarter-symmetric metric connection...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{nanoparticles}} in hybrid and polymeric matrices {{has been}} investigated. Different types of nanocomposites have been prepared. The ormosil type based on organoalkoxy silanes shows surprising properties {{with respect to}} solid content and relaxation. Thick films for coatings, embossed films for diffractive purposes, high temperature stable binders for glass fiber insulation materials and printing pastes have been prepared. The nanomer type with nanoparticles homogeneously dispersed in polmer matrices led to optical adhesives with improved properties <b>with</b> <b>respet</b> <b>to</b> Tg and thermal coefficient of expansion. The inverse nanomer type with the nanoparticles forming a percolating network was developed for photo curable optical interference layers on plastic, for example to AR coating by using simple wet chemical coating techniques...|$|E

40|$|Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of azo-biphenyl {{derivatives}} AZO 1 {{have been}} ssembled on gold surfaces and electrocally tested under irradiation. Comparable maximal cis/trans ratios of ca. 0. 9 {{have been observed}} in all cases upon irradiation at λ = 370 nm and λ = 360 nm.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{substrate}} binding order of S-adenosylmethionine and norepinephrine to phenylethanohamine N-methyltransferase via the use of two inhibitors of this enzyme. 2 -(2, 5 -Dichlorophenyl) cyclopropylamine hydrochloride (SN &F 9208) competitively inhib-ited norepinephrine as the variable substrate hut was an uncompetitive inhibitor <b>with</b> <b>respe(t</b> t() S-adenosylmethionine. S-Adenosylhomocvsteine, however, was a competitive inhibitor with respect to S-adenosylmethionine l) ut noncompetitive as an antagonist of norepinephrine. These studies are interpreted to suggest a kinetically ordered pattern of substrate binding to the enzyme, with S-adenosylmethionine being initially bound...|$|R
40|$|The Ornans (C 3 O) {{carbonaceous}} chondrite shows {{many examples of}} isolated olivine grains which are Mg-rich and show cathodoluminescence (CL). Using backscattered electron imaging to scan and select Mg-rich isolated olivine grains, and a CL detector, the chemical zoning within these grains was investigated together with its relation to CL and to chemical zoning of grains within a Fe-rich chondrule. Composition profiles from the core to the rim of five isolated forsterites showed details of Al, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, and Fe zoning <b>with</b> <b>respet</b> ot position and CL color...|$|R
