The absence of monitors meant zero stage volume - if the P.A. was {{switched off the}} only audible elements would be Manson's voice and the cymbals; and no monitor volume - instead, the band utilised Sennheiser IEMs to monitor their live sound. The use of digital technology in the band's in-ear mixes and F.O.H. mix meant that instead of a multitude of manual settings needing restored at each soundcheck, the band's FOH and monitor engineers only had to recall the last session from the previous night. Each performance was recorded in the DSD format by taking a data dump from the mixing console at 24-bit/48k and saving the <b>wave</b> <b>file</b> onto disc for future reference.|$|E
5000|$|Layer II is {{commonly}} used within the broadcast industry for distributing live audio over satellite, ISDN and IP Network connections {{as well as for}} storage of audio in digital playout systems. An example is NPR's PRSS Content Depot programming distribution system. The Content Depot distributes MPEG-1 L2 audio in a Broadcast <b>Wave</b> <b>File</b> wrapper. MPEG2 with RIFF headers (used in [...]wav) is specified in the RIFF/WAV standards. As a result, Windows Media Player will directly play Content Depot files, however, less intelligent [...]wav players often do not. As the encoding and decoding process would have been a significant drain on CPU resources in the first generations of broadcast playout systems, professional broadcast playout systems typically implement the codec in hardware, such as by delegating the task of encoding and decoding to a compatible soundcard rather than the system CPU.|$|E
50|$|The framed style, {{which is}} often created {{to look like a}} harp with strings, uses an array of photodiodes or photoresistors inside the upper or lower part of the frame to detect {{blocking}} of the laser beams. The framed harp built by Geoffrey Rose in 1975/6 was an octagonal shape with a 5 X 5 matrix of laser beams. The lasers can be mounted on the 'neck' or upper side of the harp, shining down, or on the body, shining up. Typically, the lasers used are very low-powered 5 mW red or green lasers, which are considered safe for public interaction by the FDA. Any number of laser beams can be arranged in this type of laser harp, from as few as one or two, up to 32 or more, depending on the capacity of the MIDI controller(s) and software being used. This style of Laser Harp can be created in any size, from a lap sized harp to a room sized installation, or larger, like the installations seen at Burning Man. In this design, only an analog DC (on/off) trigger is created by the breaking of the beam (and the DC circuit made by the beam shining on the optic sensor), which is sufficient to trigger any number of events (musical or otherwise) as determined by the data analyzer/software in question. In the MIDI controller, this analog DC current interruption is converted to a digital signal, which is then used to trigger many possible events or actions. Some software comes equipped with full <b>wave</b> <b>file</b> editors and synthesizers, and can also trigger video and still imagery via projection units.|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{describes the}} development of a MOD music player to run on GBA (Game Boy Advance) for Lypson Game Engine. GBA is a basic platform for embedded development, and the stereo system makes it possible to use the platform as a music player. The sound players of the GBA for Lypson Game Engine were designed to play <b>wave</b> <b>files</b> and the size of typical <b>wave</b> <b>files</b> is in the order of megabytes. MOD files are much smaller when compared with wave ones. Therefore, to avoid consuming the resources of the CPU and memory to process and store <b>wave</b> <b>files,</b> the use of MOD files represents a better alternative. The development took C++ as programming language and the development platform used was HAM. The first step was to obtain samples of music, and then control the hardware of GBA to play sound. After that, came the phase of combining it with Lipson Game Engine. These tasks enabled the acquisition of knowledge about the frame of MOD files; learning how to make the GBA play sound and mastering the operating instruction of GBA hardware by the process of development. In addition, it provided a chance to learn about embedded development, which represented a starting point to learn about embedded programming in general. As for the main result, it was achieved by the successful development of the MOD Player, which is now running on the Lypson Game Engine. As the MOD files are of small size, the music player is more efficient when compared with those previously used...|$|R

Combinations of steganography and cryptography have been made in this paper to increase the level of security and to make the system more complex to be defeated by attackers. This paper presents a method of ciphering and hiding information into a cover of audio <b>wave</b> <b>file.</b> In the first step, the text is converted to its equivalent ASCII code. Text is scrambled using DES (Data Encryption Standard) technique according to secret key then the cipher text is embedded inside a cover audio <b>wave</b> <b>file</b> using time and frequency domain. The modeled system builds of a secret key steganographic system, which embeds certain text after scrambling into random positions inside audio <b>wave</b> <b>file</b> and the other technique used in this paper to analyze the cover audio into its frequency components is wavelet transform using Haar filter as a basis function. Tests were carried out to evaluate the performance of the modeled algorithm and results in successful hiding. From the simulation results on the time domain, it is noticed that value of Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) will decrease as the number of bits in the audio <b>wave</b> <b>file</b> to be replaced by the message increase and noticed that the value of SNR in frequency domain is higher than in time domain, so hiding in frequency domain is better than hiding in time domain...|$|E
