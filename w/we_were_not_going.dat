500|$|In April 2010, Sutherland {{said in an}} {{interview}} at a BAFTA event in London that the script was finished and he would be reading it upon his return to the United States. He also said that the film will be a two-hour representation of a twenty-four-hour time frame. Sutherland described the film production as [...] "exciting" [...] because, [...] "It's going to be a two-hour representation of a 24 hour day, so <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to be restrained by the real time aspect of the TV show." ...|$|E
2500|$|U.S. General Gallagher in Hanoi {{reported}} a [...] "noticeable {{change in the}} attitude of the Annamites [...] here...since that became {{aware of the fact that}} <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to interfere and would probably help the French.|$|E
2500|$|After being {{informed}} by intercom that a hijacking was in progress, Captain Uri Bar Lev {{decided not to}} accede to their demands:"I decided that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to be hijacked. The security guy was sitting here ready to jump. I told him that I {{was going to put}} the plane into negative-G mode. Everyone would fall. When you put the plane into negative, it's like being in a falling elevator. Instead of the plane flying this way, it dives and everyone who is standing falls down." ...|$|E

The rules of asylum in principle forbid meddling {{in the politics of}} the country that grants asylum. But as a matter of courtesy <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to bar Julian Assange from exercising his right to be a candidate. Just so long as he doesn't make fun of Australian politicians or people." ...|$|R

2500|$|Jim Sullivan, {{the local}} Official IRA commander, {{feared that the}} troops would launch a bigger raid and {{instructed}} his men to move weapons out of the area. At about 6pm, Provisional IRA volunteers attacked the troops with improvised hand grenades. A number of soldiers suffered leg injuries. As more troops arrived, [...] "the Officials realized {{that they would have}} to fight" [...] and Sullivan ordered his men to confront the troops. An Official IRA source later said, [...] "The way we looked at it, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to put up our hands and let them take the weaponry. We didn't want the confrontation, but we couldn't surrender". One source said that 60–70 Official IRA volunteers were involved, while another said 80–90. Each was armed with a rifle and at least one revolver. They exchanged fire with the troops and attacked them with grenades. Hundreds of local youths also pelted the troops with stones and petrol bombs. Journalist Simon Winchester later wrote:To anyone who experienced the battle, it was perfectly obvious that hundreds and hundreds of bullets were being fired by both sides – and yet the Army had the gall, when asked by reporters later in the weekend, to say that its soldiers fired only 15 shots in sum. The official figures were to be published later: soldiers in the Falls that weekend fired no less than 1,457 rounds.|$|E

6000|$|... "It seems <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> into Mazatlan, after all," [...] said Miss Keene at last, without {{lifting her}} {{conscious}} {{eyes from the}} sea.|$|R

5000|$|Chiluba's {{personal}} appearance and dapper dress {{as well as}} his short stature (Chiluba stood just 1.5 m (5 ft) tall) was taken notice of both by his supporters and opponents throughout his career. In connection to European corruption allegations against him in the late 2000s, it was revealed that a Swiss shop had produced over 100 pairs of size 6 shoes for him with two inch heels, many monogrammed. [...] His careful appearance and taste for fine suits became a trademark, and was noted during his corruption trial. In a particularly harsh example, Zambian Post writer Roy Clarke ran a recurring column which lampooned the President during his time in office as [...] "a vain, cross-dressing, high-heel wearing, adulterous, dwarf thief". [...] Political opponents make reference to these charges and traits in their criticisms of Chiluba's rule. Candidate Michael Sata, for instance, has played on this popular stereotype of Chiluba, charging that [...] "Chiluba's thinking is as tall as he <b>is...</b> <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to steal money, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to plunder, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to buy suits, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to buy shoes. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to give girls houses..." [...] President Kaunda famously referred to Chiluba as the [...] "Four-foot Dwarf" [...] during Chiluba's rise in opposition politics. Chiluba was acquitted of all corruption charges in August 2009. [...] Mr Chiluba had also been described by the BBC as [...] "a fervent born-again Christian..." [...] whose [...] "...private life was the subject of much gossip." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{he found}} out that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>NOT</b> <b>going</b> to Mazatlan, and this was his only chance; it must have {{happened}} just as the ship went about and stood off from shore again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> fast, just then, and it didn't hurt him. We saw him get up {{and shake}} his fist at the robber. If he ever meets Mr. Wampus again he'll murder him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Indeed I did. She would come. It was {{her first}} act of rebellion; for <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to let you meet the frosts alone--the October frosts, I mean; I hope the Dynevor Frosts are all right?' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No, indeed," [...] {{said another}} man, {{who had just}} raised {{his head out of}} the cabin hatch; [...] "and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to take it, either." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Besides, some {{of these}} villages are very strong, and we might suffer a good deal before we could carry it if they had notice of our coming. However, you were quite right {{to point out to}} me that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> in what seemed the right direction." ...|$|E
60|$|Frithiof did not answer, but tore {{away at the}} wheel. Then he beckoned us {{three to}} help, and we held the wheel down till the Rathmines {{answered}} it, and we found ourselves looking into the white of our own wake, with the still oily sea tearing past our bows, though <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> more than half steam ahead.|$|E
6000|$|... "Think of our bride's brother amusing {{himself in}} such a place as that with cooking drugs in saucepans," [...] muttered Monsieur Justin, peeping into the room. [...] "I am the least {{particular}} man in the universe, but I must say I wish <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to be connected by marriage with an amateur apothecary. Pah!

6000|$|... "Of no consequence, I assure you. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> {{hard on a}} {{lady who}} {{did not belong to}} the Women's Press Association. Take a harp." ...|$|R

60|$|On {{the point}} of starting, Captain Bob's men raised the most {{outrageous}} cries, and tried to prevent us. Though hitherto we had strolled about wherever we pleased, this grand conjunction of our whole force, upon one particular expedition, seemed to alarm them. But we assured them that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to assault the village; and so, after {{a good deal of}} gibberish, they permitted us to leave.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure, and didn't {{you agree}} with me, Carrie," [...] her husband said, in an aggrieved voice, [...] "that as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to make the boy a parson, and as {{it was too much}} to expect him to learn Spanish, and a score of other things, at once; that we ought to get someone who would make his lessons {{pleasant}} for him, and not be worrying his soul out of his body with all sorts of useless balderdash?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Though {{lying there}} alone, the poor creetur was as well {{taken care of}} as could be hoped, and would have been quite {{unconscious}} of any one's sitting by him then. I got the Major to say that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> away at present and that I would come back to-morrow and watch a bit by the bedside. But I got him to add--and I shook my head hard to make it stronger--"We agree that we never saw this face before." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank {{you very}} much," [...] she said. [...] "It is all rather in the air, at present, you know. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> married for some time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> {{into the}} theater," [...] {{answered}} May stiffly. She {{did not like}} either Slugger or Nappy, and was sorry the pair had shown themselves.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{if he is}} there, you bet <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to {{run away}} from him!" [...] {{declared}} Phil. [...] "Come on, let's see if we can't shoot him." ...|$|R
60|$|Esmeer's {{idea came}} with {{an effect of}} real {{emancipation}} to several of us. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> {{to be afraid of}} ideas any longer, we were going to throw down every barrier of prohibition and take them in and see what came of it. We became for a time even intemperately experimental, and one of us, at the bare suggestion of an eminent psychic investigator, took hashish and very nearly died of it within a fortnight of our great elucidation.|$|E
60|$|After partaking {{of bitter}} maté, I thanked my hostess, looked my last into Monica's dark, sorrowful eyes, lifted {{for one moment}} to mine, and kissed little Anita's pathetic face, by so doing filling the child with astonishment and causing {{considerable}} amusement to {{the other members of}} the family. After we had ridden about four miles, keeping nearly parallel with the river, it struck me that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> in the right direction--the right one for me, at any rate. I therefore checked my horse and told my companions that I would not trouble them to ride with me any further.|$|E

'He {{does not}} seem to have any fixed plan, Dorothy, but I fancy from what he said that he is more likely to wander about and look at the towns, and such places as Niagara and the other places {{tourists}} go to as a matter of course. He certainly did not say a word about shooting, and my warning was in no way given seriously. If <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> away ourselves I should miss him amazingly, for a better fellow never trod in shoe leather. Now, it's half-past ten, dear, and the sooner we are both in bed the better, for we are to be called at six.' ...|$|E
