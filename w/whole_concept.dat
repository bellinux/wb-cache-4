She nonetheless honored her pledge and did not run for reelection to a fourth term in 2000. She was succeeded by Lieutenant Governor Butch Otter, a fellow Republican.

Although Anderson wrote all the music and lyrics, he co-credited the writing to a fictional schoolboy named Gerald Bostock.

So, when Pam mentioned the title, we immediately {{came up with}} the tempo and the whole feeling of the song, and then she {{came up with the}} lyrics. There was a really good flow to that song.

500|$|The initial {{planning}} for T2 3-D: Battle Across Time {{began in the}} early 1990s. Jay Stein, Universal Parks & Resorts' Chairman and CEO at the time, asked Gary Goddard and his team at Landmark Entertainment to develop a stunt show based around the Terminator franchise. Goodard sought permission from MCA Planning and Development (later Universal Creative) to morph this concept into a theater-based presentation featuring a 3-D film, live action and pyrotechnics. After a year-and-a-half of development, MCA Planning and Development and Landmark Entertainment approached James Cameron's Lightstorm Entertainment for ultimate approval. Although Cameron was originally against the idea of Universal taking his Terminator franchise and converting it into a ride, he found the storyboards and the <b>whole</b> <b>concept</b> to be [...] "great", so the project was green-lit.|$|E
500|$|Libra Scale was {{released}} on November 22, 2010.

Which in turn is why I've called it 'Libra Scale'.

However, {{at the last minute}} before shooting, Gaga changed her mind regarding the <b>whole</b> <b>concept,</b> leading to a disagreement with Kahn, and hence it was cancelled. She then shot the scenes with Clarence Clemons in a New York City set. She later explained that her idea was to create a [...] "sweater set of a video". She wanted to acknowledge herself and the success she had experienced in her music career, with a simplified video showing her dancing outside her New York apartment from her early days.

50|$|The {{hypothesis}} that standard medical {{concepts of the}} disease were heavily biased towards hospital based patients attracted the interest of Dr. Peter Williams, then secretary of the Wellcome Trust, and a chance meeting resulted in Wellcome Trust support to Dr. Paul Milner, Dr. Graham Serjeant and Beryl {{over the next four}} years (1967-71). The grant provided a Volkswagen minibus which functioned as a mobile clinic and extensive travels over Jamaica following up patients long lost to the Clinic and the University Hospital showed that many were well and had actually improved with age. This observation changed the <b>whole</b> <b>concepts</b> of sickle-cell disease, confirmed the role of symptomatic selection and made the case for studies of the true natural history based on newborn detection of the disease.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "susceptible" [...] implies {{weakness}} or some {{increased danger}} {{that one is}} more likely to become victim to and must guard against.

500|$|Despite {{the high}} {{expectations}} {{attached to the}} Leader, {{it was not the}} motive power revolution that Bulleid intended it to be. No part of the Leader design was perpetuated on the British Railways Standard class locomotives by Robert Riddles, nor did it find favour internationally, with the Garratt articulated locomotives providing a similar function for less maintenance. The <b>whole</b> <b>concept</b> was quietly dropped in 1951 after Bulleid left British Railways to become Chief Mechanical Engineer of Córas Iompair Éireann (where he produced CIÉ No. CC1, a peat-burning locomotive to a similar design) and all five were scrapped. The culmination of the project was a £178,865 5s 0d (equivalent to £ as of [...] ) bill for the taxpayer though, when the press reported the story as late as 1953, it was claimed that £500,000 (equivalent to £ as of [...] ) was wasted on the project. R. G. Jarvis, who was placed in charge of the project after Bulleid's departure, insisted that the locomotive required an entire re-design to solve the problems of the original concept.|$|E
500|$|The film {{became so}} {{ubiquitous}} that Time said its presentation [...] "left only the livestock {{unaware of the}} chance to learn the facts of life."
