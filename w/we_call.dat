6000|$|... "I married Dorothy's sister, Virginia. Virginia {{did not in}} {{the least}} {{resemble}} her sister, but our eldest daughter was strikingly like her dead aunt. <b>We</b> <b>called</b> her Dorothy, and Charles was devoted to her.

5|$|<b>We</b> <b>call</b> on {{international}} organisations {{to ensure the}} world's 61 million out-of-school children are in education {{by the end of}} 2015.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{ingredients}} for lifewhat <b>we</b> <b>call</b> 'pre-biotic chemistry'are abundant in many solar system objects, such as comets, asteroids and icy moons. Biologists believe liquid {{water and energy}} are then needed to actually support life, so it's exciting to find another place where we might have liquid water. But, energy is another matter, and currently, Callisto's ocean is only being heated by radioactive elements, whereas Europa has tidal energy as well, from its greater proximity to Jupiter.|$|E
25|$|<b>We</b> <b>call</b> for the US {{government}} to pay reparations to the Iraqi people.|$|E

25|$|<b>We</b> <b>call</b> the set C {{the pair}} of A and B, and denote it {A,B}.|$|E
25|$|<b>We</b> <b>call</b> {{this the}} group of Hodge classes of degree 2k on X.|$|E
25|$|Break of metaphor: Metaphors are {{interpreted}} literally: Duty is calling? <b>We</b> <b>call</b> back.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>called</b> {{everything}} by Spanish names, and played perpetually at being Spaniards.|$|R

25|$|<b>We</b> <b>call</b> a {{relation}} symmetric if {{every time the}} relation stands from A to B, it stands too from B to A.|$|E
25|$|Yeah, it's a paste, tastes pretty good, actually. It has {{millions}} of little computers — <b>we</b> <b>call</b> them trackers — which {{work their way}} into your cells.|$|E

5000|$|The white dancers {{eventually}} {{called the}} dance the black dancers did the [...] "Big Apple", after the night club where they first saw it. [...] Ross commented that [...] "We always {{did the best}} we could to imitate the steps we saw. But <b>we</b> <b>called</b> it the Little Apple. We didn't feel like we should copy the Big Apple, so <b>we</b> <b>called</b> it that." ...|$|R
60|$|Those whom <b>we</b> <b>called</b> brutes {{had their}} revenge when Darwin shewed {{us that they}} are our cousins.|$|R
25|$|If T {{satisfies}} TT* = T*T, <b>we</b> <b>call</b> T normal. It {{turns out}} that normal matrices are precisely the matrices that have an orthonormal system of eigenvectors that span V.|$|E
25|$|The {{important}} fact in this {{construction is}} that if X is a paracompact space, this map is a bijection. This {{is the reason why}} <b>we</b> <b>call</b> infinite Grassmannians the classifying spaces of vector bundles.|$|E

30|$|<b>We</b> <b>called</b> {{the above}} {{formulation}} here after model (B), where the objective function is (2) under (3)–(5) and (7)–(20) constraints.|$|R
30|$|We {{introduce}} new coordinates {{to simplify the}} operator L (cf. [11, pp. 327 – 329]) that <b>we</b> <b>called</b> the Goursat coordinates.|$|R

25|$|Contemporary with Hume, but {{critical}} of Hume's scepticism, a so-called Scottish school of Common Sense formed, whose basic principle was enunciated by its founder and greatest figure, Thomas Reid:If {{there are certain}} principles, as I think there are, which the constitution of our nature leads us to believe, and which we are under a necessity {{to take for granted}} in the common concerns of life, without being able to give a reason for them — these are what <b>we</b> <b>call</b> the principles of common sense; and what is manifestly contrary to them, is what <b>we</b> <b>call</b> absurd.|$|E
25|$|If a {{morphism}} f is bijective, {{then its}} inverse {{is also a}} morphism, and <b>we</b> <b>call</b> f an isomorphism and the two G-sets X and Y are called isomorphic; for all practical purposes, they are indistinguishable in this case.|$|E
25|$|We are 100 percent {{certain that}} it is suicide, suicide as <b>we</b> <b>call</b> it, that as a {{consequence}} of his own behaviour, and with no one else involved, he threw himself in front of a car, of several cars, and died on the third attempt.|$|E
6000|$|... "No doubt," [...] said Disco, {{in reply}} to Harold's remark, [...] "the lip-rings are {{uncommon}} ugly, but the principle o' the thing, sir, that's w'ere it is, the principle ain't no wuss than ear-rings. The savages, as <b>we</b> <b>calls</b> 'em, bores holes in their lips an' sticks rings into 'em. The civilised folk, as <b>we</b> <b>calls</b> ourselves, bores holes {{in their ears}} an' sticks rings into 'em. W'ere's the difference? that's wot I want to know." ...|$|R
