5|$|Diptera {{is one of}} {{the major}} insect orders and are of {{considerable}} ecological and human importance. Flies are important pollinators, second only to the bees and their Hymenopteran relatives. Flies may have been among the evolutionarily earliest pollinators responsible for early plant pollination. Fruit flies are used as model organisms in research, but less benignly, mosquitoes are vectors for malaria, dengue, <b>West</b> <b>Nile</b> <b>fever,</b> yellow fever, encephalitis, and other infectious diseases, and houseflies spread food-borne illnesses. Flies can be annoyances especially in some parts of the world where they can occur in large numbers, buzzing and settling on the skin or eyes to bite or seek fluids. Larger flies such as tsetse flies and screwworms cause significant economic harm to cattle. Blowfly larvae, known as gentles, and other dipteran larvae, known more generally as maggots, are used as fishing bait and as food for carnivorous animals. They are also used in medicine in debridement to clean wounds.|$|E

50|$|A lethal ovitrap is {{a device}} which attracts gravid female container-breeding {{mosquitoes}} and kills them. The traps halt the insect's life cycle by killing adult insects and stopping reproduction. The original use of ovitraps was {{to monitor the}} spread and density of Aedes and other container-breeding mosquito populations by collecting eggs which could be counted, or hatched to identify the types of insects. Since its conception, researchers found that adding lethal substances to the ovitraps could control the populations of these targeted species. These traps are called lethal ovitraps. They primarily target Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which are the main vectors of dengue <b>fever,</b> Zika virus, <b>west</b> <b>Nile</b> virus, yellow <b>fever,</b> and chikungunya.|$|R

5000|$|An insect {{repellent}} (also commonly called [...] "bug spray") is a substance applied to skin, clothing, or other surfaces which discourages insects (and arthropods in general) from landing or climbing on that surface. Insect repellents help prevent {{and control the}} outbreak of insect-borne (and other arthropod-bourne) diseases such as malaria, Lyme disease, dengue fever, bubonic plague, and <b>West</b> <b>Nile</b> <b>fever.</b> Pest animals commonly serving as vectors for disease include insects such as flea, fly, and mosquito; and the arachnid tick.|$|E
50|$|<b>West</b> <b>Nile</b> <b>fever</b> is a mosquito-borne {{infection}} by the West Nile virus. Approximately 80% of West Nile virus {{infections in}} humans have {{few or no}} symptoms. In the cases where symptoms do occur—termed <b>West</b> <b>Nile</b> <b>fever</b> in cases without neurological disease—the time from infection to the appearance of symptoms is typically between 2 and 15 days. Symptoms may include fever, headaches, feeling tired, muscle pain or aches, nausea, loss of appetite, vomiting, and rash. Less than 1% of the cases are severe and result in neurological disease when {{the central nervous system}} is affected. People of advanced age, the very young, or those with immunosuppression, either medically induced, such as those taking immunosuppressive drugs, or due to a pre-existing medical condition such as HIV infection, are most susceptible. The specific neurological diseases that may occur are West Nile encephalitis, which causes inflammation of the brain, West Nile meningitis, which causes inflammation of the meninges, which are the protective membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord, West Nile meningoencephalitis, which causes inflammation of the brain and also the meninges surrounding it, and West Nile poliomyelitis—spinal cord inflammation, which results in a syndrome similar to polio, which may cause acute flaccid paralysis.|$|E

50|$|Members of the Aedes genus {{are known}} vectors for {{numerous}} viral infections. The two most prominent species that transmit viruses are Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus which transmit the viruses that cause dengue fever, yellow fever, <b>West</b> <b>Nile</b> <b>fever,</b> chikungunya, eastern equine encephalitis, and Zika virus, {{along with many}} other, less notable diseases. Infections with these viruses are typically accompanied by a fever, and, in some cases, encephalitis, {{which can lead to}} death. A vaccine to provide protection from yellow fever exists, and measures to prevent mosquito bites include: insecticides such as DDT, mosquito traps, insect repellents, and mosquito nets.|$|E

Systematic follow-up studies of patients with WNF have not been done, so this information is largely anecdotal. In addition to a high fever, headache, chills, excessive sweating, weakness, fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, drowsiness, pain in the joints and flu-like symptoms.

50|$|While {{the general}} {{prognosis}} is favorable, current {{studies indicate that}} <b>West</b> <b>Nile</b> <b>Fever</b> can often be more severe than previously recognized, with studies of various recent outbreaks indicating that it may {{take as long as}} 60-90 days to recover. People with milder WNF are just as likely as those with more severe manifestations of neuroinvasive disease to experience multiple long term (>1+ years) somatic complaints such as tremor, and dysfunction in motor skills and executive functions. People with milder illness are just as likely as people with more severe illness to experience adverse outcomes. Recovery is marked by a long convalescence with fatigue. One study found that neuroinvasive WNV infection was associated with an increased risk for subsequent kidney disease.|$|E

It causes infection through biting during blood meal. In the southern U.S., it is the primary vector of St. Louis encephalitis virus. In India and Southeast Asia, it is the primary vector of Wuchereria bancrofti, a nematode that causes lymphatic filariasis. It acts as an intermediate host for the helminth parasite by harbouring the larval stages. It also transmits Plasmodium relictum, a malarial parasite of birds, and is the principal vector in Hawaii. It is the definitive host for malarial parasite as it harbours the sexual cycle.|$|E
50|$|Wildlife, {{domestic}} {{animals and humans}} share a large and increasing number of infectious diseases, known as zoonoses. The continued globalization of society, human population growth, and associated landscape changes further enhances the interface between wildlife, {{domestic animals}}, and humans, thereby facilitating additional infectious disease emergence. The wildlife component of this triad has received inadequate focus {{in the past to}} effectively protect human health as evidenced by such contemporary diseases as SARS, Lyme disease, <b>West</b> <b>Nile</b> <b>Fever,</b> {{and a host of other}} emerging diseases. Further, habitat loss and other factors associated with human-induced landscape changes have reduced past ability for many wildlife populations to overcome losses due to various causes. This disease emergence and resurgence has reached unprecedented importance for the sustainability of desired population levels for many wildlife populations and for the long-term survival of some species.|$|E

He anticipates that they will also be useful for treating diseases like smallpox in the event of an outbreak, and would give protection immediately instead of weeks or the month required by typical vaccines.|$|E
