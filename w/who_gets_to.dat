The senior prom dress was a sexy black mini dress that was befitting of her more desirable date. The dresses presented an identity crisis to one character: [...] "Here's the thing – I've never really known for sure which {{of those two}} people I am – the girl who almost doesn't get asked to the prom at all or the girl <b>who</b> <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> go with the really cute guy.

500|$|Although largely well-liked, Mulan's {{characterization}} {{has drawn}} some mild criticism and speculation, inspiring {{a series of}} generally mixed to positive reviews from some film critics. Entertainment Weeklys Owen Gleiberman wrote, [...] "Far more than Beauty and the Beast or the stolidly virtuous Pocahontas, Mulan showcases a girl <b>who</b> <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> use her wits ...a testament {{to the power of}} mind over brawn." [...] However, Gleiberman continued, [...] "Mulan finally falls a notch short of Disney's best... because the heroine's empowerment remains... an emotionally isolated quest." [...] Similarly, Moira Macdonald of The Seattle Times hailed Mulan as [...] "a strong, engaging character who, unlike many of her Disney counterparts, needs no one to rescue her from danger," [...] while questioning her personality, asking, [...] "was it really necessary to bestow Mulan with self-esteem problems? Because she seems so confident and intelligent, her sad statement that she wants to 'see something worthwhile' in the mirror comes as a bit of a shock." ...|$|E

We're grateful for the opportunity to have a new generation of players experience a gameday at the Big House and to test themselves against college football's all-time winningest program." [...] Appalachian State played their first year of football in the FBS in 2014 and joined the Sun Belt Conference as full members.

500|$|In early 1990, Guns N' Roses {{returned}} to the studio to begin recording the full-length follow-up to Appetite for Destruction. Recording sessions initially proved unproductive due to Steven Adler's struggle with drug addiction, which made him unable to perform and caused sessions to abort for several days at a time. Adler was fired the following July and replaced by Matt Sorum of The Cult. Keyboardist Dizzy Reed also joined the band that year at Rose's insistence. Sorum and Reed played their first show with Guns N' Roses at Rock in Rio 2 in January 1991. The group fired its long-time manager, Alan Niven, in May of that year; Rose reportedly forced the dismissal of Niven against the wishes of his bandmates by refusing to complete the new album until Niven was gone. He was replaced by roadie Doug Goldstein, whom Izzy Stradlin described as [...] "the guy <b>who</b> <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> go over to Axl's at {{six in the morning}} after he's smashed his $60,000 grand piano out of the picture window".|$|E
500|$|California Chrome had {{a tumultuous}} four-year-old season. The horse began 2015 at Santa Anita in the San Antonio Stakes on February 7, a return matchup with Shared Belief, whose traffic {{problems}} in the Classic prevented a true match against California Chrome. Art Sherman and Shared Belief's trainer, Jerry Hollendorfer, were longtime friends and rivals from the Northern California racing circuit, and each anticipated the rivalry between their two horses. Sherman said, [...] "I just want both of us {{to be at the}} head of the stretch with no excuses and then it's <b>who</b> <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> the wire first." [...] Shared Belief went off as the favorite, and although California Chrome took the lead by the [...] pole, Shared Belief edged him in the final sixteenth and won, with California Chrome second by a length and a half. [...] California Chrome next shipped to Meydan Racecourse for the Dubai World Cup on March 28, where he needed to run at night, under artificial lighting, and without Lasix. He went off as the favorite but finished second to the Irish-bred longshot Prince Bishop, owned by Hamdan bin Mohammed Al Maktoum of Godolphin Racing. Sherman noted that his horse ran wide on the turns but said, [...] "He tried every inch of the way. There's nothing wrong with finishing second in this type of a race." ...|$|E
500|$|After taking office, Lois {{attempts}} {{to propose a}} tax raise, though when this fails, begins to use fear tactics to raise funds {{to clean up the}} lake. Her efforts are successful and life returns to the clean lake. She even has leftover cash afterwards, so she embezzles $600 to purchase a purse, much to Brian's disappointment. Peter has also succumbed to the perks of being the mayor's husband: he has rerouted the town's electrical system and caused rolling blackouts to bring late comedian Jim Varney back from the dead (he does nothing but talk, playing his character Ernest, [...] and repeatedly refer to [...] "Vern".) He then remembers he actually wanted John Belushi and takes Varney outside to shoot him, only for Varney to end up taking the gun from him and Peter running away from him warning Brian. [...] Later, Lois is tempted to buy a $4,300 fur coat, and Bob Grossbeard, president of the local oil company, offers to buy it for her if she will allow him to dump his oil runoff in the lake. Lois reluctantly accepts his offer, but as the opening of the new runoff pipe begins, Lois realizes the error of her ways and closes the valve to the pipe and resigns her position as mayor, stating that she was consumed by money and power, which led her to become the very same things she set out to destroy. Lois then allows West to have his job as mayor back, but a random bystander points out that neither Lois nor Mayor West has any jurisdiction to do so, and that the city has to have a whole new election to decide <b>who</b> <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> be the mayor of Quahog. This prompts West to pull out a gun and shoot him, as well as two others whom he believes objected.|$|E

They {{are not at all}} like the king and his people, who are brown and very pretty: for these are black as negroes and as ugly as sin, poor souls, and in their own land they live all the time at war, and cook and eat men's flesh. The Germans make them work; {{and every now and then}} some run away into the Bush, as the forest is called, and build little sheds of leaves, and eat nuts and roots and fruits, and dwell there by themselves. Sometimes they are bad, and wild, and people whisper to each other that some of them have gone back to their horrid old habits, and catch men and women in order to eat them. But it is very likely not true; and the most of them are poor, half-starved, pitiful creatures, like frightened dogs. Their life is all very well when the sun shines, as it does eight or nine months in the year. But it is very {{different}} the rest of the time. The wind rages then most violently. The great trees thrash about like whips; the air is filled with leaves and branches flying like birds; and the sound of the trees falling shakes the earth. It rains, too, as it never rains at home. You can hear a shower while it is yet half a mile away, hissing like a shower-bath in the forest; and when it comes to you, the water blinds your eyes, and the cold drenching takes your breath away as though some one had struck you. In that kind of weather it must be dreadful indeed to live in the woods, one man alone by himself. And you must know that if the lean man feels afraid to be in the forest, the people of the island and the Black Boys are much more afraid than he; for they believe the woods to be quite filled with spirits; some like pigs, and some like flying things; but others (and these are thought the most dangerous) in the shape of beautiful young women and young men, beautifully dressed in the island manner with fine kilts and fine necklaces, and crosses of scarlet seeds and flowers. Woe betide him or her <b>who</b> <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> speak with one of these! They will be charmed out of their wits, and come home again quite silly, and go mad and die.
