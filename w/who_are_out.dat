5|$|Stealing a Ride follows two children, Susie Gay and Johnnie Eddy, <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> tobogganing on sleds. The two see Susie's parents {{going out}} for a drive in a sleigh and ask to come along. The parents refuse and {{secretly}} two hitch their sleds behind the sleigh. When going up a hill, Susie loses her grip on her sled and Johnnie tries to save her from falling in vain. The two fall off and are unable to catch up the sleigh. The children wander into the woods and become lost. When Susie's parents discover the empty sleds they turn back and track down the children by the footprints they left in the snow {{with the aid of a}} dog. The parents find them asleep in the snow and bring them back home in the sleigh. The children are punished by spanking and then kissed by their parents for their actions.|$|E

25|$|Studies of {{a speech}} {{community}} that presuppose the existence of that community may reproduce stereotypes that fail to accurately depict the social reality of variance among subgroups within a community and overlapping identities for individuals. Furthermore, studies of gay male language use often look at middle class European Americans <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> as gay {{to the exclusion of}} other subgroups of the LGBTQ community, and hence may draw misleading conclusions about the community as a whole.|$|E

25|$|Guanyin is {{also seen}} as the {{champion}} of the unfortunate, the sick, the disabled, the poor, and those in trouble. Some coastal and river areas of China regard her as the protector of fishermen, sailors, and generally people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> at sea, thus many have also {{come to believe that}} Mazu, the goddess of the sea, is a manifestation of Guanyin. Due to her association with the legend of the Great Flood, where she sent down a dog holding rice grains in its tail after the flood, she is worshiped as an agrarian and agriculture goddess. In some quarters, especially among business people and traders, she is looked upon as a goddess of fortune. In recent years there have been claims of her being the protector of air travelers.|$|E
25|$|Virtual Virginia (VVa) is the Department of Education's {{system for}} {{providing}} online courses to students. These classes are mostly Advanced Placement classes {{for students who}} are home schooled or go to a public high school (some courses are offered to middle school students) where the course is not taught. These courses are offered free of charge to students enrolled through a high school, but not to those in private or home schooling, or those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of state. This program got its start in the 1980s, when AP courses were offered through satellite schools to students in Virginia, mostly to those in rural areas without many other education options. The program became known as the Virginia Satellite Education Network (VSEN). That program got combined with Virtual Virginia Advanced Placement School to become what it is today.|$|E

500|$|The Virgin {{occupies}} an earthly {{space as}} opposed to a sacred one, but remains aloof. This approach is emphasised by secondary midground figures <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> in the open air, while the main figures are positioned in an elevated room containing a throne, grand arches and wood carvings. Van der Weyden's setting is less artificial than van Eyck's; here Luke and Mary face each other as equals, rather than in van Eyck's painting where, as Blum describes [...] "a divinity and a mortal" [...] face one another. Van der Weyden omits the winged angel holding a crown hovering above the Virgin; the figure was included in the underdrawings, but eventually abandoned. [...] The landscape is more secular than van Eyck's, which is dominated by church spires.|$|E
500|$|On March 25, 2008, Gravel {{announced}} that he would leave the Democrats and join the Libertarian Party, saying: [...] "My libertarian views, as well as my strong stance against war, the military industrial complex and American imperialism, seem not to be tolerated by Democratic Party elites <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of touch with the average American; elites that reject the empowerment of American citizens I offered to the Democratic Party {{at the beginning of this}} presidential campaign with the National Initiative for Democracy." [...] The following day Gravel entered the race for the 2008 Libertarian presidential nomination, saying that he would have run as a third-party candidate all along except that he needed the public exposure that came from being in the earlier Democratic debates. Gravel's initial notion of running as a fusion candidate with other parties was met with skepticism and not pursued.|$|E

[...] RPGamer's Stuart Hoggan opined that although Aerith [...] "represented the token damsel in distress," [...] she [...] "broke the mould in terms of personality," [...] possessing [...] "an admirable pluck that was not brassy nor off-putting." [...] In 2007, she was included in Tom's Games list of top 50 greatest female characters in video game history, for her death scene and the beauty of her appearance and personality.

2500|$|Idol - Jakten på en superstjerne is a {{television}} show on the Norwegian television channel TV 2, based on the popular British show Pop Idol.

2500|$|Michael Tigar, her attorney, {{stated that}} [...] "this case {{really is a}} threat to all the lawyers <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> there {{attempting}} to represent people that face these terrible consequences." [...] Supporters of Stewart alleged that the government charged her for her speech in defending the rights of her client. They believed that Stewart's efforts to release communications from her client were part of an appropriate defense method to gain public awareness and support. They also expressed alarm that wiretaps and hidden cameras authorized by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act were used by the government to gather evidence against her, which they called a violation of attorney–client privilege. George Soros' Open Society Institute also donated $20,000 to Stewart's legal defense fund in 2002. Commenting on her case, human rights organization Front Line states that it [...] "has had a chilling effect on human rights defenders who stand between government agencies and potential victims of abuses." ...|$|E
