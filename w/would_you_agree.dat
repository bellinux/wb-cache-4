It seems that there is both a deep interrelation and a disjunction between the psychoanalytic account of gender identity and the philosophical (moral-political) ideal of freedom in your theory, and that much of the energy and force of your work proceeds from the ways in which each discourse’s account of sex inflects the other’s. <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> with this, and in what ways have you found the tension between psychoanalytic and legal-political discourse to be itself productive of new ways of thinking about sex and identity...|$|E

40|$|Before your {{interview}} for Avant, you have written: "I recently {{did a lot}} of work in cognitive science research which explicitly crosses over between phenomenology and dynamics, and in some sense this {{can be seen as a}} continuation of Hume's specific project to establish a foundational science of man". <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> that one of the determinants of an unprejudiced approach to traditional philosophy is … an enthusiasm? I think that cultivating an awareness of our past is an essential aspect of managing our future, and this is especially the case if we are interested in shaping the future of the sciences of the mind. In this regard we should not forget that Hume himself, of course, was also an enthusiastic scholar and famous historian. However, I would not say that this enthusiasm gives rise to an ‘unprejudiced approach ’ as such; we should not forget the critical lessons of postmodernism. At the same time it is certainly true that each of the great traditional philosophers had somewhat different prejudices than we have now, and therefore reading their works presents us with an opportunity to reevaluate our own positions from a rather fresh perspective. And in many cases we will find that their traditional perspective is still implicitly determining aspects of our modern discourse, although this role will have been more or less covered by subsequent historical sedimentation. Going back to these original sources and making their ongoing relevance explicit is an important task of modern philosophy. It can show us how the fundamental problems we are trying to solve today, whether by means of scientific experimentation, philosophical analysis, or phenomenological reflection, are not absolutely independent from our background. On the contrary, the problems gain their significance and status as problems from the context of understanding and practice in which they are embedded, and we should not be drawn into resolving a problem unless we agree 88 AVANT Volume II, Number 1 / 2011 www. avant. edu. pl with the premises that define it as such.

40|$|Dans le contexte actuel de pénuries de compétences, la {{fonction}} ressources humaines — après avoir encouragé les départs anticipés — se voit confrontée au défi de maintenir en emploi les employés vieillissants. Après avoir passé en revue les principales pratiques de gestion associées à la rétention des employés de 50  ans et plus, les auteurs mesurent leur effet sur l’extension de la vie professionnelle de 402 cadres des services sociaux et de santé de Montréal. Les résultats, une fois validés à partir de ceux de deux autres sources de données (tirés de la même enquête), permettent d’élaborer une stratégie de maintien en emploi axée sur les quatre dimensions suivantes : 1) élaboration d’un projet de fin de carrière, 2) aménagement du temps de travail, 3) amélioration de la qualité de vie au travail, 4) stimulants financiers. In many industries in Quebec and Canada, {{as well as}} in other Western countries, labour shortages have now replaced labour surpluses in a context where succession is growing scarce and a real culture of rapid departure has developed {{as a result of the}} recent waves of early retirement and the work overload that this has created for the “survivors. ”After years of encouraging departures and of managing early retirement programs, the human resources (HR) function now faces the new challenge of attempting to retain aging employees in today’s context of multiple restructuring, infrastructure sharing, growing competition and—for the Public Service—tighter management of the financial resources that the state makes available to institutions. This raises the question of whether it is possible today to have end-of-career employees extend their working lives. In the 1980 s and 1990 s, numerous studies (Rosen and Jerdee 1985 a; Nusberg 1986, 1989; Meier 1988; Dennis 1988; Hale 1990; Shea 1991) presented—based on the specific needs and expectations of this category of workers—management practices which were supposed to satisfy end-of-career employees and encourage them to stay in their jobs longer. However, the issue of the effectiveness of these practices has rarely been addressed. What is the value of this model of managing aging? Can it be useful for HR managers?According to the domain-specific literature, a retention strategy may be based on a number of practices aimed at extending the working life of older employees. These practices will be presented according to seven main categories: career planning, career development, career moves, job content design, time management, pay and benefits, and employment relationship. The effectiveness of these practices will then be assessed on the basis of a sample of managers who, in March 2001, answered a more general questionnaire on job dissatisfaction, mobilization and retention in the Montreal health and social services sector. Out of a total of 3525 managers, 1054 managers answered the questionnaire. Of this number, 402 managers were aged 50 years or over and formed the sample used in this study. Extension of working life (EWL), the dependent variable used in this study, was assessed through four indicators: expectations of early retirement, expectations of extending working life, planned retirement age and desired age (regardless of any financial consideration). Thirty-seven practices which are supposed to be linked with retirement departure were drawn from the literature and retained as independent variables. Other variables—socio-demographic, professional, psychological and organizational—act as control variables in certain analyses. The results show that the percentage of explanation of EWL through end-of-career management practices is only 13 %. As amply repeated in the literature, end-of-career managers are particularly partial to individualized arrangements. These managers stay on because their employer has organized a stimulating end-of-career project for them that is either challenging or offers particularly attractive working conditions. Without these accommodations, there is no hope of retaining these managers, short of offering substantial financial incentives. From this analysis of management practices emerged a strategy for retaining older managers based on: (1) a stimulating end-of-career project; (2) individualized arrangements of work time (and place) or advantages which allow for this flexibility and (3) in addition to—or in the absence of—these elements, financial incentives can always be used to “purchase” the retention of older employees. To validate the retention strategy which emerged from the preceding results, two additional analyses were conducted. The first analysis used other independent variables, i. e. the opportunities offered by the workplace to satisfy a number of professional expectations. These variables could be considered as intervening variables between management practices and the decision to stay employed. The second analysis was based on the results of an open-ended question which asked the respondent, “Under what conditions <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> to extend your career beyond the planned retirement age?”The results allow us to complete and specify the retention strategy described above. Thus, four tools are available to retain end-of-career managers in the Montreal health and social services sector:Although the impact of these practices on the extension of working life is less significant than the impact of individual factors (seniority, health status, expected financial situation at retirement, importance of work in life, etc.), the impact of these practices is far from insignificant. Thus, this demonstrates that the HR function has a role to play in the development and implementation of a management strategy to retain managers aged 50  or over. En el contexto actual de escasez de competencias, la función de recursos humanos – después de alentar el retiro anticipado – se ve confrontada al desafío de mantener en empleo los empleados que envejecen. Después de haber pasado en revista las principales prácticas de gestión asociadas a la retención de empleados de 50 años y más, los autores miden el efecto de éstas sobre la extensión de la vida profesional de 402 ejecutivos del sector de servicios sociales y salud de Montreal. Los resultados, validados a partir de los resultados de otras dos fuentes de datos (obtenidos por la misma encuesta), permiten elaborar una estrategia de mantenimiento en empleo basada sobre las siguientes cuatro dimensiones : 1) elaboración de un proyecto de fin de carrera, 2) acondicionamiento del tiempo de trabajo. 3) mejora de la calidad de vida en el trabajo, 4) estimulos financieros...|$|E
