The organisation aimed to bring manufacturers and designers together {{to improve the quality of}} industrial design. Through his improvements in the UERL's advertising and branding, Pick was considered by many of its members to be taking a practical lead in achieving the organisation's aims and he was soon lecturing on the subject, giving talks during 1916 and 1917 at the Art Workers Guild in London, at the Royal Scottish Academy in Edinburgh and elsewhere. After the First World War, Pick continued to give talks regularly and published articles on design. He also began to set out his ideas on reconstruction and town planning, an area of design he became interested in through its connection to transport planning. He wrote and lectured extensively on this subject during the 1920s and 1930s including presenting a 14,000 <b>word</b> <b>paper</b> to the Institute of Transport in 1927 and addressing the International Housing and Town Planning Congress in 1939. Concerned about the uncontrolled and unchecked growth of London, partly facilitated by the new lines that London Underground was building, Pick was a strong supporter of the need for a green belt around the capital to maintain open space within reach of urban areas.|$|E
50|$|The <b>word</b> <b>paper</b> {{comes from}} the Greek term for the ancient Egyptian writing {{material}} called papyrus, which was formed from beaten strips of papyrus plants. Papyrus was produced as early as 3000 BC in Egypt, and sold to ancient Greece and Rome. The establishment of the Library of Alexandria limited the supply of papyrus for others. As a result, according to the Roman historian Pliny (Natural History records, xiii.21), parchment was invented under the patronage of Eumenes II of Pergamon to build his rival library at Pergamon. This however is a myth; parchment had been in use in Anatolia and elsewhere long before the rise of Pergamon.|$|E
5000|$|The word [...] "paper" [...] is {{etymologically}} derived from Latin papyrus, {{which comes from}} the Greek πάπυρος (papuros), the word for the Cyperus papyrus plant. Papyrus is a thick, paper-like material produced from the pith of the Cyperus papyrus plant, which was used in ancient Egypt and other Mediterranean cultures for writing before the introduction of paper into the Middle East and Europe. Although the <b>word</b> <b>paper</b> {{is etymologically}} derived from papyrus, the two are produced very differently {{and the development of}} the first is distinct from the development of the second. Papyrus is a lamination of natural plant fibres, while paper is manufactured from fibres whose properties have been changed by maceration.|$|E

40|$|This 5000 <b>word</b> <b>paper</b> {{begins with}} a {{critique}} of the need to declare what design ‘is' and to mark out set boundaries and programmes for its practice. The paper then advances and explains different trajectories in design thinking - different modal futures or ‘prospects'- produced in different sites of a diagram that lays out the exigencies and determinations in which programmes for designing may be plotted. This paper seeds two of the research programmes Rosenberg has been developing from 2003 to the present viz. research into: (1) nature and shape of design thinking – in practice. This research has been produced looking at two axes within design thinking – poetic and ethical. The poetic is conceived as that which makes ‘other' and the ethical is for an ‘Other'. (2) critical practice in design. The thrust of this area of research is to look into the way criticism (the critical) may draw together “use” (project) and “discourse” (programme) ...|$|E
