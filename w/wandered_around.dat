The remnants of Abby were absorbed by a cold front the same day.|$|E

He and his scouts were soon identified as actually being Confederates, and, in a small skirmish near Leavenworth, Indiana, Hines had to abandon his men as he swam across the Ohio River under gunfire. He <b>wandered</b> <b>around</b> Kentucky for a week seeking information on Morgan's whereabouts.|$|E

25|$|Disgusted by the {{unconditional}} obedience {{demanded by}} the Catholic orphanage and drawn {{by the prospect of}} adventure, Rocker ran away from the orphanage twice. The first time he just <b>wandered</b> <b>around</b> in the woods around Mainz with occasional visits to the city to forage for food and was retrieved after three nights. The second time, which was at the age of fourteen and a reaction to the orphanage wanting him to be apprenticed as a tinsmith, he worked as a cabin-boy for Köln-Düsseldorfer Dampfschiffahrtsgesellschaft. He enjoyed leaving his hometown and traveling to places like Rotterdam. After he returned, he started an apprenticeship to become a typographer like his uncle Carl.|$|E

25|$|In 1915, Ord was a {{military}} aide {{on the staff of}} the governor of Arizona. He was also a liaison with Army unit that included his former regiment. He saw service on the Mexican border due to the rise of tension along the border following the Battle of Agua Prieta. This was where Pancho Villa sustained his greatest defeat and his units were disorganized and <b>wandered</b> <b>around</b> northern Mexico foraging for supplies. Desperate for food and fresh horses, Pancho Villa camped his army of an estimated 500 horsemen outside of Columbus, New Mexico on the Mexican side of the border in March 1916. On March 9, 1916, he invaded the United States for supplies and arms which resulted in the Battle of Columbus. Ord had been given the rank of Major and served Arizona well in organizing and arming militia units. No major raids across the border took place in Arizona.|$|E
25|$|According to the Bible, {{after their}} {{emancipation}} from Egyptian slavery, {{the people of}} Israel <b>wandered</b> <b>around</b> and lived in the Sinai desert for a span of forty years before conquering Canaan in 1400 BCE {{under the command of}} Joshua. While living in the desert, according to the Biblical writings, the nation of Israel received the Ten Commandments at Mount Sinai from YHWH via Moses. After entering Canaan, portions of the land were given to each of the twelve tribes of Israel. For several hundred years, the Land of Israel was organized into a confederacy of twelve tribes ruled by a series of Judges. After that came the Israelite monarchy, established in 1000 BCE under Saul, and continued under King David and his son, Solomon. During the reign of David, the already existing city of Jerusalem became the national and spiritual capital of the United Kingdom of Israel and Judah. Solomon built the First Temple on Mount Moriah in Jerusalem.|$|E

25|$|Six years later, {{at the age}} of 28, Cui Yan befriended Gongsun Fang (公孫方) {{and others}} and they studied {{together}} under the tutelage of the Confucian scholar Zheng Xuan. However, in 184, before Cui Yan could complete his studies, the Yellow Turban Rebellion broke out in China. The rebels from Xu Province attacked Beihai Commandery (北海郡), where Zheng Xuan conducted his classes, so Zheng and his students fled east to Mount Buqi (不其山; northwest of Mount Lao) to evade chaos. Despite so, the rebellion had resulted in food shortages, so Zheng Xuan {{had no choice but to}} send his students away. After leaving Mount Buqi, Cui Yan could not return to Qinghe Commandery because rebel forces and bandits were rampant in the region and the roads leading west were blocked. He <b>wandered</b> <b>around</b> Qing, Xu, Yan and Yu provinces and visited several places, including Shouchun (壽春; present-day Shou County, Anhui), Lake Tai and the northern bank of the Yangtze River. After four years, he returned home and spent his time playing music and writing calligraphy.|$|E

[...] He told speechwriter Jeff Greenfield, [...] "You know, the death of Martin Luther King isn't the worse thing that ever happened in the world."

500|$|While {{staying with}} Pommereul, {{he was given}} a room with a desk facing the Pellerine Mountain, which Balzac used as the setting for the book's first scene. He <b>wandered</b> <b>around</b> the city, taking in details to use in his {{descriptions}} of the landscape. In researching recent history, Balzac was examining events from his first years on the planet. Biographer Graham Robb notes that the original subtitle of the book was La Bretagne en 1799 – the year of Balzac's birth. As Robb puts it, [...] "the discovery of contemporary history took Balzac back to his childhood." ...|$|E
500|$|The composers {{started their}} writing separately, Cornell in his {{apartment}} in Paris, and Arnold in his house in London. Cornell stated that he had some difficulties with composing: [...] "It is difficult, I think, to write lyrics for a character, so really I just kind of <b>wandered</b> <b>around</b> {{for about a month}} not thinking about it too much, until I sort of formulated some idea of a way that I could approach it, where I'm kind of relating to what's in the character in the movie. And because this particular Bond is very edgy, but also has a lot of emotional depth, it's a lot easier." [...] Later the two musicians met and showed each other's ideas, and according to Arnold [...] "it was almost like we wrote two parts of the same song." [...] Cornell wrote lyrics, to which Arnold added some lines and later music. Some of Arnold's ideas included the song's title, the heavy introduction, and [...] "having the same genetic material as the Bond theme, but in a different order and in a different shape".|$|E
500|$|In late 1940 the Allies {{recovered}} {{the journal of}} an Italian officer during an operation at Sidi Barrani. The diary referred to fears of British paratroopers being landed to the Italian rear. At the time the Allies had no airborne troops in the North African region. Dudley Clarke, in charge of military deception in the region, decided to play on these fears by creating a fictional airborne unit. Clarke began Operation Abeam in January 1941 by creating a paper trail for the 1st SAS Brigade. The fictional unit was supposedly training for special missions in Transjordan. Clarke established their existence using documentary and physical subterfuge. Photographs of parachutists were printed in local papers, documents were planted with the enemy, Allied airmen were warned {{to look out for}} gliders (Victor Jones mocked up some dummies to support the story), and a section of desert was cordoned off for [...] "training". To aid the rumours, two soldiers were dressed in 1st SAS uniforms and <b>wandered</b> <b>around</b> the Allied-held cities of Cairo, Port Said, and Alexandria, where they were briefed to hint at missions in Crete or Libya.|$|E
