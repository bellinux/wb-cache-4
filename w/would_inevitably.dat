5|$|Beagle {{required}} {{large numbers}} of chronometers because some <b>would</b> <b>inevitably</b> break down on long voyages and the chronometers were essential for {{the mission of the}} ship. Further, the rates of all chronometers vary with time. Although this can be allowed for by interpolating between the regular rate checks, {{there is no guarantee that}} the changes are linear, and often they are not. Averaging the readings from a large number of chronometers, especially if they are of a variety of types, will tend to cancel out such errors.|$|E
5|$|With {{their victory}} in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05, the Japanese became {{concerned}} {{about the potential for}} conflict with the US. The theorist Satō Tetsutarō developed the doctrine that Japan should have a battlefleet at least 70% the size of that of the US. This would enable the Japanese navy to win two decisive battles, the first early in a war against the US Pacific Fleet, and the second against the US Atlantic Fleet which <b>would</b> <b>inevitably</b> be dispatched as reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|Both sides had {{suffered}} severe damage and casualties, but both were also {{aware that the}} battle <b>would</b> <b>inevitably</b> be rejoined and so {{the aftermath of the}} British defeat was one of frenzied activity at Gibraltar, Algeciras and Cadiz. While the British and French squadrons conducted hasty repairs, the French and Spanish fleet at Cadiz was prepared for a rescue mission, a heavy squadron arriving at Algeciras on 12 July. As the squadron departed with Linois's squadron, it was attacked again by Saumarez's squadron at the Second Battle of Algeciras and caught at night by faster and more manoeuvrable ships, which resulted in the British inflicting heavy losses on the Spanish rearguard but failing to destroy the French squadron for a second time.|$|E
50|$|Plans {{to build}} the Channel Tunnel were {{scrapped}} in the 1970s on cost grounds. This gave the Night Ferry a short reprieve; a tunnel <b>would</b> have <b>inevitably</b> led {{to the end of}} conveying passenger carriages by train ferry.|$|R
3000|$|... (τ) would detect both {{patterns}} and assign a similar {{score in the}} two cases. Other aggregated parameters, such as the relative change in the overall incoming flow per topic, {{are not able to}} capture this type of patterns, that <b>would</b> be <b>inevitably</b> hidden by larger flows with possibly less significant relative variations over time.|$|R
50|$|Ikbal Ali Shah {{believed}} that Bolshevism's encroachment on {{the countries of}} Central Asia <b>would</b> almost <b>inevitably</b> lead to catastrophic results, and by 1921 was reporting in the Edinburgh Review on the methods of propaganda and political influence used by the Bolshevists in Central Asia and Afghanistan, with its consequences for British rule in India.|$|R
5|$|In 1973 the LPO {{was caught}} up in a {{recurring}} phenomenon of London orchestral life: the conviction in official circles that having four independent orchestras is too much for one city, and that two or more of the existing ensembles should merge. On this occasion the targets were the LPO and the New Philharmonia; the latter, a self-governing body formed under its new name when the Philharmonia was disbanded in 1964, was going through a bad patch, professionally and financially. The proposed merger <b>would</b> <b>inevitably</b> have led to redundancies, and the player-owners of both orchestras rejected the plan.|$|E
5|$|In September 2009, Vancouver re-signed Luongo to a 12-year extension. As such, it {{was widely}} speculated that Schneider <b>would</b> <b>inevitably</b> be traded. Despite his success in the AHL, his chances of {{competing}} for a starting position with the Canucks were seen as unlikely by the media due to Luongo's prominence on the team. Regardless, he publicly maintained he was unfazed by {{his position on the}} Canucks' depth chart and that he was focused on competing with the newly acquired Andrew Raycroft for the Canucks' backup position in 2009–10. Schneider was, however, sent back to the Moose out of training camp.|$|E
5|$|Kiedis {{knew that}} the band's sound <b>would</b> <b>inevitably</b> change when Navarro joined. In June 1994, the band entered The Sound Factory, a {{recording}} studio in Los Angeles, to record the album. The band completed a few basic tracks, when Kiedis began having difficulty singing. He had been through a dental procedure in which an addictive sedative, Valium, was used; this caused him to relapse, and he once again became dependent on drugs. Kiedis had slipped from five years of sobriety and began reusing narcotics he'd sworn never to use again. The band took a short break from recording to perform at Woodstock '94, {{which was the first}} show Navarro played with the Red Hot Chili Peppers.|$|E

Together {{with her}} we agreed that {{if she were to}} publish what we had been told by Gen Diya, the likelihood was that not only would the Nigerians deny the story, but this <b>would</b> also <b>inevitably</b> condemn Ken Saro-Wiwa and others and Generals Obasanjo and Yar’Adua to death.|$|R

50|$|The Court of Appeal did {{not make}} a ruling on the {{lawfulness}} or otherwise of the search as it agreed that the evidence <b>would</b> have <b>inevitably</b> been discovered by the police acting in line with their common law duties to take possession of the property of a crash victim where he is in no state to do so.|$|R
5|$|The 2011–12 season <b>would</b> <b>inevitably</b> {{be a new}} era after Maya Moore's graduation. Her absence and {{the loss}} of 6th-man Lorin Dixon left {{significant}} holes to fill in the roster. Geno Auriemma seemed to find the right pieces with a freshman class that included Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis, Brianna Banks and Kiah Stokes. Mosqueda-Lewis was another State Farm/WBCA High School Player of the Year for UConn, Banks was a highly rated guard, and Stokes, a 6'3 post player, was highly ranked as well. Other key players included sophomores Stefanie Dolson and Bria Hartley, junior Kelly Faris and senior Tiffany Hayes, who would be all selected in the WNBA drafts after graduation.|$|E
5|$|The {{disaster}} {{had both}} political and military dimensions. In Parliament, Churchill suggested that an official inquiry into the disaster should be held after the war. When this wartime speech was published in 1946, the Australian government asked if the British government still intended to conduct the inquiry. The Joint Planning Staff considered the matter, and recommended that no inquiry be held, as {{it would not be}} possible to restrict its focus to the events surrounding the fall of Singapore, and it <b>would</b> <b>inevitably</b> have to examine the political, diplomatic and military circumstances of the Singapore strategy over a period of many years. Prime Minister Clement Attlee accepted this advice, and no inquiry was ever held.|$|E
5|$|Thomas O'Brien was a Canadian miner and {{businessman}} who had prospered considerably during the rush, investing widely in businesses {{across the city}} {{to become one of}} the wealthiest of the local hotel and saloon owners. O'Brien had considerable confidence that Dawson would continue to grow as an economic powerhouse in the region, both because of its remaining gold deposits and the presence of Canadian government institutions. O'Brien believed that transportation costs <b>would</b> <b>inevitably</b> keep the prices for imported beer high in Dawson and make a local brewery a profitable venture, with the potential to export its product into the neighbouring U.S. district of Alaska.|$|E

60|$|She was face to {{face with}} the most cruel problem ever set before a human heart, for she firmly {{believed}} that if through her self-sacrifice she saved him from death and dishonour, he <b>would</b> nevertheless <b>inevitably</b> turn to the other woman, for whose sake he was suffering now; yet she was ready with the sacrifice, because of the selflessness of her love.|$|R
50|$|The 19th {{century was}} {{a period in which}} the {{perception}} of an antagonism between religion and science was especially strong. The disputes surrounding the Darwinian revolution contributed to the birth of the conflict thesis, a view of history according to which any interaction between religion and science <b>would</b> almost <b>inevitably</b> lead to open hostility, with religion usually taking the part of the aggressor against new scientific ideas.|$|R
5|$|On 31 January, US {{ambassador}} Peter Galbraith unsuccessfully {{tried to}} persuade Tuđman's aide Hrvoje Šarinić to accept another extension of the UNPROFOR mandate, explaining that the conflict <b>would</b> <b>inevitably</b> escalate once the UN force withdrew. This rebuff was followed by harsh French and UK diplomatic responses calling on the UN to ignore the Croatian decision, which resulted in Tuđman dismissing any extension of the mandate. The US Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs, Richard Holbrooke, met Tuđman and suggested to him that if UNPROFOR was permitted to stay, Croatia could count on integration into the European Union and NATO. As {{a way out of}} the diplomatic row, Holbrooke proposed that UNPROFOR be replaced by a new mission using the same personnel and organisational structure. Following Croatian agreement, the UNSC adopted Resolution 981 establishing the United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia (UNCRO), replacing UNPROFOR in the country. The new mission's name was devised by Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations Shashi Tharoor.|$|E
5|$|The Liberals and PC party {{differed}} considerably on {{fiscal and}} tax policies. In his opening campaign speech at Massey Hall in Toronto, Diefenbaker contended that Canadians were overtaxed {{in the amount}} of $120 per family of four. Diefenbaker pledged to reduce taxes and castigated the Liberals for not reducing taxes despite the government surplus. St. Laurent also addressed tax policy in his opening speech, in Winnipeg. St. Laurent noted that since 1953, tax rates had declined, as had the national debt, and that Canada had a reputation as a good place for investments. The Prime Minister argued that the cost of campaign promises made by the Progressive Conservatives <b>would</b> <b>inevitably</b> drive up the tax rate. Diefenbaker also assailed tight-money monetary policies which kept interest rates high, complaining that they were hitting Atlantic and Western Canada hard.|$|E
5|$|The {{state and}} federal governments also had {{conflicts}} on the economic front. UMNO leaders feared that the economic dominance of Singapore <b>would</b> <b>inevitably</b> shift political power away from Kuala Lumpur. Despite earlier agreement to establish a common market, Singapore continued to face restrictions when trading with the rest of Malaysia. In retaliation, Singapore refused to provide Sabah and Sarawak {{the full extent of the}} loans previously agreed to for the economic development of the two eastern states. The Bank of China branch of Singapore was closed by the Central Government in Kuala Lumpur as it was suspected of funding communists. The situation escalated to such an extent that talks between UMNO and the PAP broke down, and abusive speeches and writings became rife on both sides. UMNO extremists called for the arrest of Lee Kuan Yew.|$|E
60|$|Disconcerted, he {{went back}} into the cabin, to hold a council, apparently, from the way the jabbering broke forth. The Reindeer was very deep in the water, and her {{movements}} had grown quite loggy. In a rough sea she <b>would</b> have <b>inevitably</b> swamped; but the wind, when it did blow, was off the land, and scarcely a ripple disturbed the surface of the bay.|$|R
50|$|Williams then {{received}} a second trial, {{in which his}} attorneys again moved to suppress all evidence stemming from the interrogation of Williams by the detectives. The judge ruled that Williams' statements to the detectives were inadmissible, but citing Stewart's footnote, ruled that the body was admissible as evidence, as it <b>would</b> have <b>inevitably</b> been discovered by law enforcement. On July 15, 1977, Williams was again convicted of first degree murder.|$|R
5000|$|The {{majority}} opinion {{found that an}} [...] "inevitable discovery exception" [...] to the exclusionary rule was constitutional, noting that such a rule was already standard practice in most state and federal courts. The Court stated that law enforcement was not required to demonstrate that it had violated a defendant's rights in good faith, only that the evidence <b>would</b> have <b>inevitably</b> been found despite the violation. Williams' conviction was thereby upheld.|$|R
5|$|George {{wakes up}} the next morning on the river bank, and finds a treehouse {{belonging}} to a Christian missionary named Father Hubert. Hubert has been nursing Nico back to health, but she has suffered a snakebite and requires special medicine. He takes George to the local Mayan village, as he believes the village Shaman will be able to help. George shows his Mayan stone to the shaman, who explains that, hundreds of years ago, Mayan shamans had trapped the god Tezcatlipoca inside a mirror. However, he was so powerful that he <b>would</b> <b>inevitably</b> escape, so they created three stones that contained the power to keep him imprisoned. Before they could be put in place, they were stolen by explorers: one by a Spanish pirate named Captain Ketch, who hid it in the Caribbean; one by an English ship, which took it to England; and one by Spanish explorers, who took it back to Spain. The third of these stones was in Nico's and George's possession. George returns to the treehouse and cures Nico with medicine from the shaman. Shortly thereafter, the two separate to find the two remaining stones.|$|E
5|$|The {{breakup of}} the old Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata during the 1810s {{eventually}} resulted {{in the emergence of}} independent nations of Paraguay, Bolivia and Uruguay in the northern portion of the Viceroyalty, while its southern territories coalesced into the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata. Rosas planned to restore, if not all, at least a considerable part of the former borders of the old Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. He never recognized the independence of Paraguay and regarded it a rebel Argentine province that <b>would</b> <b>inevitably</b> be reconquered. He sent an army under Manuel Oribe who invaded Uruguay and conquered most of the country, except for its capital Montevideo that endured a long siege starting in 1843. When pressed by the British, Rosas declined to guarantee Uruguayan independence. In South America, all potential foreign threats to Rosas's plans of conquest collapsed, including Gran Colombia and the Peru–Bolivian Confederation, or were troubled by internal turmoil, as was the Empire of Brazil. To reinforce his claims over Uruguay and Paraguay, and maintain his dominance over the Argentine provinces, Rosas blockaded the port of Montevideo and closed the interior rivers to foreign trade.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet {{leadership}} viewed {{events in}} Poland with alarm. De-Stalinisation was underway in the Soviet Union as well, but the Soviet leadership did not view the democratic reform that the Polish public desired as an acceptable solution. In Moscow, the belief was that any liberalisation in one bloc country {{could lead to}} the destruction of communism and the ruin of Soviet influence in the region as a whole. The Soviet Union was not worried solely about the political implications of reform but about the economic implications as well. Economically, the Soviet Union heavily invested in much of the Eastern Bloc and was striving for integration of its economies. The Soviet Union had financed Polish industry and was Poland's main trading partner. The Soviet Union directed what products Poland manufactured; the Soviets bought the products and exported goods to Poland no longer produced within the country itself. Due to this integration, any reform, whether political or economic, in one of the countries <b>would</b> <b>inevitably</b> have a great impact on the other. Because Poland was inextricably connected to the Soviet Union economically, the thought of an independent Polish economy was unrealistic. The country had been forced to rely on the Soviets {{for such a long time}} that breaking away completely would prove disastrous. Thus, both countries held crucial power in different facets. Poland could threaten Soviet strength and power in Eastern Europe politically, and the Soviet Union could essentially destroy the Polish economy. Therefore, any reform in the Polish government would have to concede to some Soviet demands, while the Soviets concurrently would have to concede to a vital partner.|$|E
25|$|It was {{important}} for warez group members to regulate who had access to these compromised FTP servers, to keep the network bandwidth usage low. A site that suddenly became very popular would be noticed by the real owners of the equipment, as their business systems became slow or low on disk space; investigation of system usage <b>would</b> then <b>inevitably</b> result in discovery and removal of the warez, and tightening of the site security.|$|R
40|$|There {{are several}} methods of {{performance}} assessment used by corporations {{that can be}} applied in higher education institutions as well.

25|$|Brain reserve may {{be defined}} as the brain's resilience, its ability to cope with {{increasing}} damage while still functioning adequately. This passive, threshold model presumes the existence of a fixed cut-off which, once reached, <b>would</b> <b>inevitably</b> herald the emergence of the clinical manifestations of dementia.|$|E
25|$|Indian Navy {{intelligence}} tracked Ghazi with a codename issued as Kali Devi, and Indian Navy {{began to}} realize that the Pakistanis <b>would</b> <b>inevitably</b> be forced to send their submarine Ghazi to the Bay of Bengal, as the sole ship which could operate in these waters.|$|E
25|$|Hitherto, {{the barbarian}} merchants of Europe {{have had a}} {{definite}} locality assigned to them at Aomen for residence and trade, and have been forbidden to encroach an inch beyond the limits assigned to that locality....

30|$|The easiest {{and most}} obvious {{solution}} would be to split long breath-hold periods. However, not only <b>would</b> splitting <b>inevitably</b> increase {{the overall number of}} breath-hold periods and breathing instructions, it would also interrupt the time sequence during contrast media inflow and potentially jeopardise sufficient data acquisition at peak arterial attenuation. Nevertheless, if capturing peak arterial attenuation is not deemed crucial for perfusion analysis, i.e. when applying Patlak analysis only, shortening the duration of breath-holds might be a valid option to reduced volume mismatch.|$|R
30|$|A(Φ), becomes smooth. Therefore, a mode {{conversion}} into Alfven oscillations of a geomagnetic shell is weak in this region. Drivers with band-limited spectral content, exciting transient Alfven wave response {{in a limited}} range of latitudes only, may be different. The wave energy can be transported to a resonant magnetic shell as an evanescent large-scale magnetopause surface mode or as a waveguide/cavity mode (e.g., Hartinger et al. 2012). Both the surface mode and waveguide mode <b>would</b> be <b>inevitably</b> resonantly converted into the Alfven field line oscillations.|$|R
