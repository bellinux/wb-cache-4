5|$|Beginning in July 1940, the Red Army General Staff {{developed}} war {{plans that}} identified the Wehrmacht {{as the most}} dangerous threat to the Soviet Union, {{and that in the}} case of a war with Germany, the Wehrmacht's main attack would come through the region north of the Pripyat Marshes into Belorussia, which later proved to be correct. Stalin disagreed, and in October he authorized the development of new plans that assumed a German attack <b>would</b> <b>focus</b> on the region south of Pripyat Marshes towards the economically vital regions in Ukraine. This became the basis for all subsequent Soviet war plans and the deployment of their armed forces in preparation for the German invasion.|$|E

Each season at the theatre was different; some years it would show a play or an opera, others it <b>would</b> <b>focus</b> on variety acts such as magicians, comedians and lion tamer Mademoiselle Marguerite, with her seven lions. Wrestling was hosted at the theatre as early as 1903, and had become a weekly event by 1937.

5|$|To {{demonstrate}} Henry's immortality, Miller {{decided that}} Henry would die and {{would feel the}} pain every time he died. Anything on Henry's body would disappear with his body during each death. Miller felt that Henry's naked rebirth in water would be an interesting {{way to keep the}} show's protagonist alive during the series by completing the death and rebirth process; the nakedness would create several comedic moments within the series. Miller intended to use Henry's death and rebirth process sporadically after the first two episodes so that the series <b>would</b> <b>focus</b> on Henry's long life.|$|E

Green Goblin is later shown having gathered a new gang of followers together in the sewers formed from discarded members of other villains' gangs like Vulture, Owl and the third White Dragon's gangs. These henchmen escaped their organizations unharmed because Superior Spider-Man is more focused on the larger threats (where the original Spider-Man <b>would</b> <b>focus</b> on individuals).|$|E

Atlantis has enough consumables to stay in orbit until Monday.|$|E

5|$|Breckinridge's {{first act}} as {{secretary}} {{was to meet}} with assistant secretary John Archibald Campbell, who had opposed Breckinridge's nomination, believing he <b>would</b> <b>focus</b> on a select few of the department's bureaus and ignore the rest. During their conference, Campbell expressed his desire to retain his post, and Breckinridge agreed, delegating many of the day-to-day details of the department's operation to him. Breckinridge recommended that Davis appoint Isaac M. St. John, head of the Confederate Nitre and Mining Bureau, as permanent commissary general. Davis made the appointment on February 15, and the flow of supplies to Confederate armies improved under St. John. With Confederate ranks plagued by desertion, Breckinridge instituted a draft; when this proved ineffective, he negotiated the resumption of prisoner exchanges with the Union in order to replenish the Confederates' depleted manpower.|$|E
5|$|By mid-morning, German counterattacks on PPCLI {{positions}} in the town had begun, involving tanks from the 7th Company of the 26th Panzer Regiment (26. Panzer-Regiment), field guns and substantial infantry forces. Throughout the afternoon two infantry companies of the PPCLI fought off several attacks by German forces, eventually managing to push {{them back to the}} vineyards on the northern edge of the town. While the PPCLI had taken 68 casualties, German casualties were estimated at 120. However, three strong German formation surrounded the Canadian positions at Villa Rogatti, rendering further exploitation of the bridgehead unlikely. Col. Ware was advised to be ready to withdraw across the Moro River, should German forces counterattack. In order to allow the Canadian Division a greater concentration of force, on the night of 7/8 December, the Indian 21st Infantry Brigade from the Indian 8th Infantry Division amalgamated the western flank of the 1st Canadian Division into their own lines. As a result of the withdrawal, Canadian efforts <b>would</b> <b>focus</b> on achieving a bridgehead at San Leonardo.|$|E
5|$|From the mid-twentieth century, public {{architecture}} {{became more}} utilitarian, {{as part of}} the impulse to produce a comprehensive welfare state and the influence of modernism. The main thrust of post-war planning was in clearance and rebuilding. The process began in Paisley, where from 1955 the populations of districts were decanted, the buildings demolished and rebuilding began. The result in the first district, George Street/ Canal Street, were low flats built in render and reused rubble around landscaped courtyards, with a 15-storey tower at one end. As the post-war desire for urban regeneration gained momentum it <b>would</b> <b>focus</b> on the tower block, championed in Glasgow by David Gibson, convener of the city housing committee. Projects like the brutalist Red Road Flats (1964–69) originally offered hope of a new beginning and an escape from the overcrowded nineteenth-century tenements of the city, but lacked a sufficient infrastructure and soon deteriorated. They also made extensive use of asbestos as a fire retardant, leading to long term health problems for builders and residents. Robert Matthew (1906–75) and Basil Spence (1907–76) were responsible for redeveloping the Gorbals in Glasgow.|$|E
