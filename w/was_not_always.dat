5|$|Birmingham fans {{consider}} their main rivals to be Aston Villa, their nearest neighbours geographically, {{with whom they}} contest the Second City derby. Lesser rivalries exist with fellow West Midlands clubs Wolverhampton Wanderers and West Bromwich Albion. According to a 2003 Football Fans Census survey, Aston Villa fans thought of Birmingham City as their main rivals, though this <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> the case.|$|E

He went on the wagon (for him this meant beer instead of whiskey) for days and weeks at a time. The {{difficulty}} toward the end was that he couldn't hold the stuff. He went to pieces on his second or third drink. And he did not snap back quickly.|$|E

Conflict with the Liberals drove Mason into early retirement from local politics in 1874 at the age of 57.|$|E
5|$|More than 170million years ago, Antarctica {{was part}} of the supercontinent Gondwana. Over time, Gondwana {{gradually}} broke apart and Antarctica {{as we know it today}} was formed around 25million years ago. Antarctica <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> cold, dry, and covered in ice sheets. At a number of points in its long history, it was farther north, experienced a tropical or temperate climate, was covered in forests, and inhabited by various ancient life forms.|$|E
5|$|Numbered Treaties {{were signed}} {{in the late}} 19th century with the chiefs of various First Nations that lived in the area. These {{treaties}} made specific promises of land for every family. As a result, a reserve system was established {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Federal Government. The prescribed amount of land promised to the native peoples <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> given; this led aboriginal groups to assert rights to the land through aboriginal land claims, many of which are still ongoing.|$|E

Victory in battle <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> a permanent success, as newly conquered territories were constantly retaken by Rome's enemies in Germania.|$|E
5|$|Rosebery's {{own mother}} was horrified {{at the thought}} of a Jewish woman, even a Rothschild, in the family. Rosebery too felt there was an impassable barrier of faith; at this time, it was inconceivable that any {{children}} could be reared as Jews.

5|$|A {{member of}} the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was a {{member of the}} nomenklatura, the country's de facto ruling class. Nikita Khrushchev chaired the Presidium from 1955 to 1964; Leonid Brezhnev succeeded him that year and chaired until 1982. In {{contrast}} to full members, candidate members of the Presidium could not vote during Presidium sessions. It was normal that a full member of the Presidium had previously served as a candidate member, but this <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> the case. During the term 23 people held seats in the Presidium: 14 full members and 9 candidate members. One candidate member was promoted to full membership in the Presidium during the term. Not a single Presidium member died during this period while retaining office.|$|E

5|$|Chamberlin was a {{prolific}} taxonomist who named over 4,000 new animal species in over 400 scientific publications. He specialized in arachnids (spiders, scorpions, and relatives) and myriapods (centipedes, millipedes, and relatives), ranking {{among the most}} prolific arachnologists and myriapodologists in history. He described over 1,400 species of spiders, 1,000 species of millipedes, {{and the majority of}} North American centipedes, although the quantity of his output <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> matched with quality, leaving a mixed legacy to his successors. He also did pioneering ethnobiological studies with the Goshute and other indigenous people of the Great Basin, cataloging indigenous names and cultural uses of plants and animals.|$|E
5|$|Crowley's thought <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> cohesive, and was {{influenced}} {{by a variety of}} sources, ranging from eastern religious movements and practices like Hindu yoga and Buddhism, scientific naturalism, and various currents within Western esotericism, among them ceremonial magic, alchemy, astrology, Rosicrucianism, Kabbalah, and the Tarot. He was steeped in the esoteric teachings he had learned from the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, although pushed further with his own interpretations and strategies than the Golden Dawn had done. Crowley incorporated concepts and terminology from South Asian religious traditions like yoga and Tantra into his Thelemic system, believing that there was a fundamental underlying resemblance between Western and Eastern spiritual systems.|$|E
5|$|George's {{reign of}} almost 50 years (the longest in modern Greek history) was {{characterized}} by territorial gains as Greece established its place in pre-World War I Europe. Britain ceded the Ionian Islands peacefully, while Thessaly was annexed from the Ottoman Empire after the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878). Greece <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> successful in its territorial ambitions; it was defeated in the Greco-Turkish War (1897). During the First Balkan War, after Greek troops had captured much of Greek Macedonia, George was assassinated in Thessaloniki. Compared to his own long tenure, the reigns of his successors Constantine, Alexander, and George II proved short and insecure.|$|E

5|$|Gerlachovský štít <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> {{considered}} the highest {{mountain in the}} Tatras. After the first official measurement of peaks in the Tatras {{during the period of}} the Habsburg Monarchy in the 18th century, Kriváň (2,494m) was {{considered the}} highest. Other candidate peaks for the status of the highest mountain at that time were Lomnický štít (2,633m) and Ľadový štít (2,627m). The first person to accurately name Gerlachovský štít as the highest peak was the forester Ľudovít (Ludwig) Greiner in 1838. Greiner's measurement was formally confirmed by an Austrian Army survey party in 1868. However, it was generally accepted only after the Vienna Military Institute for Geography issued a new, authoritative collection of maps of Central Europe in ca. 1875.|$|E
5|$|Goldfaden was {{churning}} out a repertoire – new songs, new plays, and translations of plays from Romanian, French, and other languages (in {{the first two}} years, he wrote 22 plays, and would eventually write about 40) – and while he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> able to retain the players in his company once they became stars in their own right, he continued {{for many years to}} recruit first-rate talent, and his company became a de facto training ground for Yiddish theater. By the end of the year, others were writing Yiddish plays as well, such as Moses Horowitz with Der tiranisher bankir (The Tyrannical Banker), or Grodner with Curve un ganev (Prostitute and Thief), and Yiddish theater had become big theater, with elaborate sets, duelling choruses, and extras to fill out crowd scenes.|$|E
