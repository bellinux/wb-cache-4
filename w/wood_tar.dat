25|$|Creosote {{was first}} {{discovered}} in its wood-tar form in 1832, by Carl Reichenbach, {{when he found}} it both in the tar and in pyroligneous acids obtained by a dry distillation of beechwood. Because pyroligneous acid was known as an antiseptic and meat preservative, Reichenbach conducted experiments by dipping meat in a diluted solution of distilled creosote. He found that the meat was dried without undergoing putrefaction and had attained a smoky flavor. This led him to reason that creosote was the antiseptic component contained in smoke, and he further argued that the creosote he had found in <b>wood</b> <b>tar</b> was also in coal tar, as well as amber tar and animal tar, in the same abundance as in <b>wood</b> <b>tar.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{application}} of <b>wood</b> <b>tar</b> to seagoing vessels was practiced through the 18th century and early 19th century, before the creosote was isolated as a compound. Wood-tar creosote {{was found not}} to be as effective in wood treatments, because it was harder to impregnate the creosote into the wood cells, but still experiments were done, including by many governments, because {{it proved to be}} less expensive on the market.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to fish the sea also provides amber, especially from its southern shores within today's borders of Poland, Russia and Lithuania. First mentions of amber deposits on the South {{coast of the}} Baltic Sea {{date back to the}} 12th century. The bordering countries have also traditionally exported lumber, <b>wood</b> <b>tar,</b> flax, hemp and furs by ship across the Baltic. Sweden had from early medieval times exported iron and silver mined there, while Poland had and still has extensive salt mines. Thus the Baltic Sea has long been crossed by much merchant shipping.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the frequency of positive patch test reaction to different contact allergens according to patients age, sex, occupation and clinical features. Between 1999 and 2003, patch testing was performed in 3, 293 patients with respective clinical diagnoses. Patch testing was done by the standard technique proposed by the International Contact Dermatitis Research Group (ICDRG). Study results showed statistically significant differences in patch test response according to sex and age for three allergens (cobalt chloride, nickel sulphate and thiomersal); according to occupation for nine allergens (cobalt chloride, nickel sulphate, balsam of Peru, fragrance mix, thiuram mix, <b>wood</b> <b>tars,</b> neomycin sulphate, thiomersal and detergents), and clinical diagnosis for two allergens (nickel sulphate, and <b>wood</b> <b>tars).</b> The most common and relevant allergens were: nickel sulphate, cobalt chloride and carba mix. They were found in all examinees regardless of age, s! ex, occupation and diagnoses. The increased awareness of allergens and their potential sources may help to limit the usage of these chemicals in manufacture of consumer products...|$|R
25|$|Because wood-tar {{creosote}} is {{used for}} its guaiacol and creosol content, it is generally derived from beechwood rather than other woods, since it distills with {{a higher proportion of}} those chemicals to other phenolics. The creosote can be obtained by distilling the <b>wood</b> <b>tar</b> and treating the fraction heavier than water with a sodium hydroxide solution. The alkaline solution is then separated from the insoluble oily layer, boiled in contact with air to reduce impurities, and decomposed by diluted sulphuric acid. This produces a crude creosote, which is purified by re-solution in alkali and re-precipitation with acid and then redistilled with the fraction passing over between 200° and 225° constituting the purified creosote.|$|E
25|$|Larrea {{started to}} {{consider}} {{the formation of a}} new squadron to force the situation in the eastern front, but it was quickly learned that this was not possible. There were no naval forces in the provinces. They only had one sloop and the port's landing craft. The arsenal only had 30 cannons and carronades of different calibers and almost useless due to age and lack of maintenance, a few rifles and less than 200 quintals of gunpowder. Their warehouses lacked <b>wood,</b> <b>tar,</b> canvas, rope and marine tools. There was no trained personnel nor protocols for the recruiting and instruction of officers, sailors nor Marines. Finally, the treasury only had a thousand pesos, customs resources were minimal due to the blockade and credit was exhausted.|$|E
500|$|Pitch was a base {{ingredient}} in many incendiary devices throughout the period. The Boeotians developed a fire machine, which they {{used against the}} Athenian wooden fortifications during the Battle of Delium in 424 BC. [...] A cauldron of burning coals, pitch and sulfur was suspended {{at one end of}} a hollowed-out log and bellows were fixed to the other end. [...] A similar mixture was used 1700 years later by the Scots, when they dropped bales of <b>wood,</b> <b>tar</b> and sulfur by crane onto the English [...] "sow" [...] (a large protective shield covering the battering ram) at the 1319 siege of Berwick-upon-Tweed.|$|E
50|$|The 18th and 19th centuries {{once more}} brought {{a certain level}} of {{economic}} health to the villages, although economic wealth did not come overnight. Reasons for this could be seen in improvements to agriculture and forestry, the distribution of former lordly and communally held lands to the peasants and also in an emerging handicraft industry. In 1861, for the first time, an industrial operation located in Brücken. <b>Wood</b> charcoal, <b>tar,</b> <b>wood</b> vinegar and other chemicals were manufactured. Serving as raw material were the surrounding forests. While some found work at the plant, local farmers also found extra earning opportunities in transporting goods or hewing wood. Brücken grew into one of the biggest villages in the Birkenfelder Land.|$|R
50|$|The {{new owners}} of the area started rapid {{economic}} exploitation {{and development of the}} forests; they brought enough settlers (mainly from overpopulated Masovia) to build several new villages in the area. Also, production of <b>wood,</b> lumber, <b>tar</b> and iron ore was started. The village was first mentioned in 1688; two years later it was reported to have just two houses.|$|R
50|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I the U. S. government demanded that a modern chemical plant be installed at Midco. They wanted the byproducts coming from the wood as it was being converted to charcoal, byproducts such as <b>wood</b> alcohol, <b>tar,</b> calcium acetate and other wood oils. Thus {{in addition to the}} iron works, Midco became the site of a sprawling chemical plant.|$|R
2500|$|The first {{construction}} {{for the new}} airfield {{began in}} late June 1942 with construction proceeding throughout the summer. [...] It included {{more than one hundred}} buildings, all intended to be temporary. Station buildings and streets were also constructed, the buildings consisting primarily of <b>wood,</b> <b>tar</b> paper, and non-masonry siding. The use of concrete and steel was limited because of the critical need elsewhere. Most buildings were hot and dusty in the summer and very cold in the winter.

50|$|Tar {{was used}} as seal for roofing {{shingles}} and tar paper and to seal the hulls of ships and boats. For millennia, <b>wood</b> <b>tar</b> was used to waterproof sails and boats, but today, sails made from inherently waterproof synthetic substances have reduced the demand for tar. <b>Wood</b> <b>tar</b> is still used to seal traditional wooden boats and the roofs of historical shingle-roofed churches, as well as painting exterior walls of log buildings. Tar is also a general disinfectant. Pine tar oil, or <b>wood</b> <b>tar</b> oil, is a pure natural product used for the surface treatment of wooden shingle roofs, boats, buckets, and tubs and in the medicine, soap, and rubber industries. Pine tar has good penetration on the rough wood. An old <b>wood</b> <b>tar</b> oil recipe {{for the treatment of}} wood is one-third each genuine <b>wood</b> <b>tar,</b> balsam turpentine, and boiled or raw linseed oil or Chinese tung oil.|$|E
50|$|Wood {{from the}} forest has long {{been used in the}} {{southern}} part of the country and in early agricultural areas as a source of fuel and as a building material.

50|$|The heating (dry distilling) of <b>wood</b> causes <b>tar</b> {{and pitch}} to drip {{away from the}} wood and leave behind charcoal. Birchbark is used to make birch-tar, a {{particularly}} fine tar. The terms tar and pitch are often used interchangeably. However, pitch is considered more solid, while tar is more liquid. Traditionally, pitch that was used for waterproofing buckets, barrels and small boats was drawn from pine. It is used to make Cutler's resin.|$|R
