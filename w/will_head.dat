The single received significant radio airplay following its release. The album, Blackbird was released on the 21st of June in Ireland and in most regions, and on the 24th in others.

5|$|The {{characteristic}} {{bright orange}} bill plates and other facial characteristics {{develop in the}} spring. At {{the close of the}} breeding season, these special coatings and appendages are shed in a partial moult. This makes the beak appear less broad, the tip less bright and the base darker grey. The eye ornaments are shed and the eyes appear round. At the same time, the feathers {{of the head and neck}} are replaced and the face becomes darker. This winter plumage is seldom seen by humans because when they have left their chicks, the birds head out to sea and do not return to land until the next breeding season. The juvenile bird is similar to the adult in plumage but altogether duller with a much darker grey face and yellowish-brown beak tip and legs. After fledging, it will make its way to the water and <b>will</b> <b>head</b> out to sea and not return to land for several years. In the interim, each year it will have a broader bill, paler face patches and brighter legs and beak.|$|E
5|$|The dungeon has a fleshed-out ecology: certain {{creatures are}} natural enemies. For example, Flies and Spiders are often found {{at odds with}} one another. Common {{behaviours}} when a creature is angry include vandalising the dungeon and deserting the player. The creatures are varied in their statistics; some excel at certain tasks, and others refuse to perform certain tasks. Which creatures enter the dungeon depends on which rooms the player has and how large they are; most creatures have prerequisites for entering service. Creatures require paying regularly, and when 'Payday' comes, <b>will</b> <b>head</b> for the Treasure room to collect their wages. Other ways to obtain creatures include imprisoning and torturing them, 'scavenging' (persuaded to defect to the player) from enemy keepers, and performing certain sacrifices at the Temple. Creatures entering via the Portal are at the lowest experience level, and must gain experience, usually by training in the training room. Training creatures increases their attributes (such as hit points) and abilities (such as which spells they can cast). Such spells include lightning bolts, rebounding projectiles, and increasing armour. Creatures will frequently enter combat with heroes or creatures belonging to another keeper. Each creature has a star of the colour of the keeper it belongs to above it, displaying its experience level. The star is a health meter; as a creature takes damage, the spikes turn black. The player {{has the ability to}} possess a creature, seeing the dungeon from its first-person perspective and using its attacks and abilities. This is one of the spells; others include speeding creatures up, and healing them.|$|E

25|$|Triggers are {{reminders}} {{that may be}} explicit or implicit about {{the performance of a}} behavior. Examples of triggers can be alarms, text messages or advertisement, triggers are usually perceptual in nature but may also be intrinsic. One of the most important aspects of a trigger is timing as only certain times are best for triggering certain behaviors. As an example if a person is trying to go to the gym everyday, but only remembers about packing clothing once out of the house it is less likely that this person <b>will</b> <b>head</b> back home and pack. In contrast if an alarm sounds right before leaving the house reminding about packing clothing, this will take considerably less effort. Although the original article does not have any references for the reasoning or theories behind the model, some of its elements can be traced to social psychology theories, e.g., the motivation and ability factors and its success or failure are related to Self-efficacy.|$|E

France {{being the only}} EU-3 country on Li Keqiang's itinerary, raises significant questions regarding the long-term sustainability of Germany as the economic power-house of the European Union, besides laying bare the consequences of military draw-down of the UK in the Asia-Pacific. The visit comes {{against the backdrop of}} an increasingly embattled German-piloted European project where opposing political currents has pitched grass-roots populism by the citizenry against the power-groups of yesteryears (bankers, big business and traditional political parties). Even with slower economic growth (7% in Q1_2015), China's foreign exchange reserves of almost $4tn ($3899bn in December 2014) place it in a position to continue to out-finance and out-spend everyone else. China's 6-year average of annual pledged overseas assistance amounts to $174bn (U.S. foreign economic assistance in 2012 amounted to $37 billion, including aid for economic development, international narcotics control, international refugees, and children's survival programs).|$|E
500|$|Gray-tailed voles are {{burrowing}} rodents that construct complex {{networks of}} tunnels and burrows. [...] They may also nest above ground, sheltered under wood, abandoned equipment, or other agricultural debris. [...] They {{are known to}} use the tunnel networks of the Camas pocket gopher. [...] The tunnels are built to provide shelter during wet periods, which are frequent throughout their range. [...] When the tunnels flood, the voles swim to dry areas or chambers in which air has been trapped. If the networks flood completely, they <b>will</b> <b>head</b> for higher ground. [...] As many as 20–30 voles have been seen gathered on dry fence posts in flooded areas. [...] When approached, they swam to safer ground nearby.

500|$|These {{animals are}} mainly nocturnal, {{particularly}} in summers.

The TBMs <b>will</b> <b>head</b> north under Second Avenue to 121st Street before turning slightly east to curve under the East River Houses, turning west on 125th Street, crossing Lexington Avenue, before ending [...] west of Fifth Avenue to accommodate storage tracks. South of 120th Street, the line will utilize a tunnel section built during the 1970s, located between 110th Street and 120th Street. This section will have tracks and other essential equipment installed, like that {{of the rest of the}} line. Since it was deemed uneconomical to use TBMs, cut-and-cover will be used to connect the existing tunnel section to the bored section to the north (at 120th Street) and to the portion of the line already in operation to the south (at 105th Street). A bellmouth will be constructed to allow for a future extension to the Bronx. The storage tracks west of the 125th Street station would replace the storage tracks north of the 96th Street station, which would then be used in revenue service as part of Phase 2.|$|E
