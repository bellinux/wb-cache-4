25|$|The AL10 RX's new {{exterior}} styling adopts the L-finesse design language, {{and outer}} features include a rear spoiler which hides the rear <b>window</b> <b>wiper</b> and radio antenna creating a less cluttered appearance. The drag coefficient {{on the latest}} RX 350 {{has been reduced to}} 0.33 C'd. Exterior dimensions are increased, with cargo room increased by five percent over the prior generation.

New cabin technologies include VoiceBox Technologies conversational speech voice recognition system, {{the first of its kind}} in the U.S., which can recognize general speech commands. The new hard disk drive HDD-based navigation system no longer uses a touchscreen, instead replacing it with Lexus' Remote Touch controller, similar in function to a computer mouse, with haptic feedback. Optional accessory features include XM Satellite Radio, a 15-speaker 330-watt Mark Levinson Surround Sound audio system, a dual-screen Rear Seat Entertainment System (RSES), 19-inch wheels, heated and ventilated front seats, power front seat cushion extender, perforated and semi-aniline leather seats, a smog sensor for the HVAC system, power folding side view mirrors, and navigation system. With XM subscription the navigation adds real-time NavTraffic and NavWeather updates.|$|E

50|$|Because {{the train}} line runs near the coast, car bodies were {{constructed}} of {{a stainless steel}} skin on a conventional steel frame for corrosion resistance. The car bodies are unpainted with blue and white stripes representing the Genkai Sea.Each car is 20 m long with four pairs of doors per side. Early trainsets had opening windows, but these were subsequently replaced with sealed windows. The trains have emergency exit doors at the ends. The doors and <b>window</b> <b>wipers</b> were added after refurbishment.|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of every mission, the player must 'start up' the machine and operating system; this is handled {{through a series of}} switches and buttons dedicated to this purpose. If a corner is turned too fast, the machine will tumble over. If the player's machine overheats, its operating system must be reset. The game even simulates <b>window</b> <b>wipers</b> in case of mud hitting the monitor. If the player does not eject when prompted, the player's in-game character will die, and all saved data will be lost, causing the player to start over.|$|R
2500|$|The {{sedan and}} Limited wagon model were dropped, leaving the wagon {{as the only}} {{available}} version in 1988, its final season and now under Chrysler's ownership. The standard and only [...] I6 engine was rated at [...] and came with either a 5-speed manual or automatic transmission with AMC's Select-Drive system. Standard equipment in 1988 that was previously optional included air conditioning system, rear window defroster, halogen headlamps, AM/FM stereo radio, light group (glove box, dome, and engine lights), and adjustable steering wheel.

50|$|The music video, {{which was}} filmed in Sydney, Australia, shows a {{homeless}} man on a street moving his hands as if playing a piano. He observes a tattooed man washing a car window and then leaving the <b>window</b> <b>wiper</b> down on a bench.

50|$|Overchurch {{was fitted}} with a small deck area just behind the bridge and around the rakish funnel. The funnel was joined to the bridge at the front and was quite high, giving the ferry a top heavy look. There were also {{sheltering}} bulkheads beneath the bridge wings. When built, she was somewhat more advanced than the two sisters. As well as the completely enclosed navigation bridge, {{she also had a}} more advanced radio system, a loudaphone system and three <b>window</b> <b>wipers.</b> Her wheelhouse was also much warmer as she was enclosed, making it more favorable for the crew who did not need to venture outside.|$|R

40|$|The project {{entitled}} ‘Quality {{and field}} of vision’ (PPAD 9 / 33 / 39) undertaken for DETR {{required that the}} effect of A-pillar thickness on driver vision be investigated. In order that a range of vehicles representing the different levels of A-pillar thickness could be used in the experimental work, a survey of vehicles was first undertaken. Whilst the focus of the survey was to measure A-pillar thickness and the driver’s seated position in order to calculate the visual angle obscured, a request was made by the client for further information to be collected at the same time. The additional information collected related to the area of the windscreen swept by the <b>window</b> <b>wipers.</b> This report details the information obtained from this aspect of the survey...|$|R
50|$|The driver {{drives off}} and the man is {{surrounded}} by cars with horns blaring, before he removes his jacket to reveal a scraggly suit. He continues to wave the <b>window</b> <b>wiper</b> like the conductor's baton before the place is surrounded {{in a blaze of}} light and he uses the baton to control everything around him, even rides at a carnival. Towards the end of the video, a man takes the <b>window</b> <b>wiper</b> away from the homeless man and the latter walks away until he reaches a cliffside. Again, he waves his hands like a conductor making the waves move in time until the song ends. He smiles.|$|E

50|$|The {{other major}} {{features}} {{in which the}} Volvo 66 differs from the DAF 66 are also mostly safety related. It has different seats featuring headrests, a safety steering wheel, steel side-impact bars in the doors, a declutching servo which enabled the driver to change gear with the choke engaged (In the older DAF models this was not possible, because the increased idle caused the centrifugal clutch to engage). The Volvo 66 also has a 'park' mode in the CVT, which locks the driveline. From 1977 the estate version featured a <b>window</b> <b>wiper</b> on the bootlid.|$|E

40|$|Digital {{electronic}} systems in automotive applications {{are in charge}} of different tasks, ranging from very critical control functions (e. g., airbag, ABS, ESP) to comfort services (e. g., handling of mirrors, seats, <b>windows,</b> <b>wipers).</b> Hardening these systems involves suitably trading off cost and reliability. Due to standards and regulations in the area, the reliability of subsystems involved even in the least critical applications has to be evaluated, and in most cases hardening has to be performed with very low extra cost. In this work, two approaches are proposed for hardening the LIN bus, which implements a serial communication network typically used in low-throughput and low-cost sub-systems in automotive applications. First, critical elements in LIN nodes are identified and some techniques to harden them are proposed following a selective hardening approach. Secondly, collaborative hardening techniques are proposed for reducing global sensitivity in a LIN network built with commercial devices, trying to achieve a high degree of robustness in the network with low cost solutions. We report some experimental results allowing evaluating the hardware cost and the robustness of the proposed technique...|$|R
