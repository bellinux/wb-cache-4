5|$|Before the {{rebellion}} at the Stonewall Inn, homosexuals were, as historians Dudley Clendinen and Adam Nagourney write, a secret legion of people, known of but discounted, ignored, laughed at or despised. And like the holders of a secret, {{they had an}} advantage which was a disadvantage, too, and <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> of no other minority group in the United States. They were invisible. Unlike African Americans, women, Native Americans, Jews, the Irish, Italians, Asians, Hispanics, or any other cultural group which struggled for respect and equal rights, homosexuals had no physical or cultural markings, no language or dialect which could identify them to each other, or to anyone else... But that night, for the first time, the usual acquiescence turned into violent resistance.... From that night {{the lives of millions}} of gay men and lesbians, and the attitude toward them of the larger culture in which they lived, began to change rapidly. People began to appear in public as homosexuals, demanding respect.|$|E
5|$|On 10 May 1940, Germany invaded Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Belgium. The 4e DI {{was ordered}} {{to hold the line}} of the Sambre river. De Hauteclocque was placed in charge of three {{infantry}} battalions. To his dismay, orders came to pull back to the Canal de l'Escaut. From there the 4e DI retreated northward, becoming encircled in the Lille pocket on 28 May. De Hauteclocque received permission to escape through German lines. He attempted to make {{his way back to the}} French lines by pretending to be a civilian refugee, but was apprehended by a German patrol and taken prisoner when they discovered an old military pay receipt. He was taken back to a German command post, where he secretly destroyed the receipt. He convinced a German colonel that he had been wounded in Morocco, suffered from malaria, and had six children, all of <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>true,</b> and he was thus exempted from military service, which was false. The Germans let him go. He then made his way to the Crozat Canal, swam across, and encountered a French patrol.|$|E

5000|$|A logical {{truth is}} {{considered}} by some philosophers to <b>be</b> a statement <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> in all possible worlds. This is contrasted with facts (<b>which</b> may also <b>be</b> referred to as contingent claims or synthetic claims) <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>true</b> in this world, as it has historically unfolded, but <b>which</b> <b>is</b> not <b>true</b> {{in at least one}} possible world, as it might have unfolded. The proposition [...] "If p and q, then p" [...] and the proposition [...] "All married people are married" [...] are logical truths because they <b>are</b> <b>true</b> due to their inherent structure and not because of any facts of the world. Later, with the rise of formal logic a logical truth was considered to <b>be</b> a statement <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> under all possible interpretations.|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to providing his qualification, Vitruvius summarizes a recurring theme throughout the 10 books, a non-trivial and core contribution of his treatise outside simply a construction book. Vitruvius {{makes the point that}} the work {{of some of the most}} talented are unknown, while many who are of lesser talent but greater political position are famous. This theme runs through Vitruvius’s ten books repeatedly – echoing an implicit prediction that his works and himself will also be unknown. <b>Which</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> for over a thousand years after he completed the 10 books.|$|E
25|$|On the 25th {{following}} Larrea's orders, {{the prisoners}} were embarked, the houses on the island burned, and the remaining population evacuated. The squadron raised anchor and sailed, arriving on the 26th in Colonia, were the prisoners debarked. Brown, ignoring the orders from his superiors to chase Romarate, only detached a small division after him, supposing that Romarate was lacking powder and ammunition (<b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> until the supplies came from Otorgués) and {{it was enough to}} assure his isolation; while the bulk of the naval squadron went to what he considered the big prize, the annihilation of the squadron defending Montevideo and taking the city.|$|E
25|$|Warren's biggest {{difficulty}} was the Jack the Ripper case. He was criticised {{for failing}} {{to track down the}} killer and faced press accusations that were frequently baseless. He was accused of failing to offer a reward for information, although in fact he supported the idea and it was blocked by the Home Office. He was accused of not putting enough police officers on the ground, whereas in fact Whitechapel was swamped with them.. He was accused of being more interested in uniformed policing than detective work, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>true,</b> but failed to take into consideration the fact that he allowed his experienced detective officers to conduct their own affairs and rarely interfered in their operations. He was accused of not using bloodhounds, and when he did eventually bring them in, he was accused of being obsessed with them.|$|E

25|$|From the 1902 season, Johnson began {{appearing}} in County Championship matches for Somerset. His qualification {{for the county}} would {{appear to have been}} fairly flimsy: there is a story, which is also told of a later Somerset cricketer, Tom Lowry, that the county put his birthplace down as Wellington, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>true,</b> without bothering to volunteer that it was not, in fact, the town of that name in Somerset. Employed as a stockbroker, he had time for fairly regular appearances in 1902 and 1903, fewer in 1904 and 1905, and then more again in 1906. From then until the First World War, Johnson appeared in only a handful of matches in each season, but for five seasons from 1921 to 1925 he was nearly always in the Somerset side, finally retiring after a few unsuccessful matches in 1927.|$|E

2500|$|The red scare of the {{immediate}} postwar years also created a negative environment for programs with even the slightest socialistic overtones, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> for the mutual housing program. [...] The CIO itself, {{with the creation of}} its own mutual housing program in which each resident owned his/her own unit, clearly illustrated that the popular housing sentiment of the time was to own your own home. The resulting lack of mutually maintained equity, and the ability of residents to independently sell out of the project, created a speculative market environment that ran counter to the principles that held the mutual housing program together. Additionally, the desire for home ownership and the increasing affordability of middle-income housing, thanks to extensive government subsidies both in the mortgage market and through tax policy following the second world war, ensured that the mutual housing concept was shelved once again.|$|E

2500|$|Nixon {{had been}} re-elected. Kissinger {{returned}} from Paris with a peace deal. Reston praised him highly. Nixon, however, decided to bomb North Vietnam {{to demonstrate his}} support for the South. Reston did a story on December 13, 1972, based on his talks with Kissinger citing obstruction by Saigon, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>true.</b> But he did not, could not, report what Kissinger had suppressed from him—he was privy to the decision to bomb Hanoi. That happened five days after the story was published. Kissinger now tried to distance himself from it and Reston was taken in by his claims. Kissinger [...] "undoubtedly opposes" [...] the bombing, he wrote and tried to explain Kissinger's compulsions. Reston's line had not gone unnoticed. The December 13 column was the last straw. It harmed his reputation. Reston had spiked the Pentagon reporter's story because it conflicted with his perceptions. The reporter was proved right.|$|E
2500|$|Anița Nandriș-Cudla's book, 20 Years in Siberia [...] is the own life's account {{written by}} a Romanian peasant woman from Bucovina (Mahala village near Cernăuți) who managed to survive the harsh, forced labour system {{together}} with her three sons. [...] Together {{with her husband and}} her three underage children, she was deported from Mahala village to the Soviet [...] Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, at the Polar Circle, without a trial or even a communicated accusation. The same night of June 12 to 13, 1941, (that is before the breakout of the Second World War), overall 602 fellow villagers were arrested and deported, without any prior notice. Her mother received the same sentence but was spared from deportation after {{the fact that she was}} a paraplegic was acknowledged by the authorities. [...] It was later discovered that the reason for her deportation and forced labour was the fake and nonsensical claim that, allegedly, her husband had been a mayor in the Romanian administration, a politician and a rich peasant, none of the latter of <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>true.</b> Separated from her husband, she brought up the three boys, overcame [...] typhus, scorbutus, malnutrition, extreme cold and harsh toils, to later return to Bucovina after rehabilitation. Her manuscript was written toward the end of her life, in the simple and direct language of a peasant with 3 years of public school education, and was secretly brought to Romania before the fall of Romanian communism, in 1982. Her manuscript was first published in 1991. Her deportation was shared mainly with Romanians from Bucovina and Basarabia, Finnish and Polish prisoners, as token proof to show that Gulag labour camps had also been used for the shattering/ extermination of the natives in the newly occupied territories of the Soviet Union.|$|E
