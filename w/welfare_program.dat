25|$|The Food Stamp Plan—a {{major new}} <b>welfare</b> <b>program</b> for urban poor—was {{established}} in 1939 to provide stamps to {{poor people who}} could use them to purchase food at retail outlets. The program ended during wartime prosperity in 1943, but was restored in 1961. It survived into the 21st century with little controversy because it was seen to benefit the urban poor, food producers, grocers and wholesalers, as well as farmers. Thus it gained support from both liberal and conservative Congressmen. In 2013, however, Tea Party activists in the House tried to end the program, {{now known as the}} Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, while the Senate fought to preserve it.|$|E
40|$|Program review has {{increased}} substantially in recent years. There has been {{concern that the}} upsurge in policy evaluation would be detrimental to social <b>welfare</b> <b>programs,</b> where data is often unavailable, little agreement exists concerning specific goals and documenting success is often virtually impossible. In this analysis we compared the program evaluation of social <b>welfare</b> <b>programs</b> with non-social <b>welfare</b> <b>programs.</b> The review process differed substantially as did the recommendation made {{as a result of}} the review. Social <b>welfare</b> <b>programs</b> faced more criticisms than non-social <b>welfare</b> <b>programs.</b> However, the criticisms were less serious. Changes prior to the publication of the evaluation report were more common for social <b>welfare</b> <b>programs.</b> They were also considerably more likely to make significant administrative changes [...] action that helps then avoid legislative involvement. lon-social <b>welfare</b> <b>programs</b> were more than twice as likely to face changes mandated by the legislature.

25|$|In Maharashtra, health {{insurance}} includes any program that helps pay for medical expenses, whether through privately purchased insurance, social insurance or a social <b>welfare</b> <b>program</b> {{funded by the}} government. In a more technical sense, the term is used to describe any form of insurance that provides protection against the costs of medical services. This usage includes private insurance and social insurance programs such as National Health Mission, which pools resources and spreads the financial risk associated with major medical expenses across the entire population to protect everyone, {{as well as social}} welfare programs such as National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) and the Health Insurance Program, which provide assistance to people who cannot afford health coverage.|$|E
25|$|Most Democrats {{and some}} Republicans are {{critical}} of such ideas, {{partly because of the}} large (US$1 trillion or more) federal borrowing the plan would require, which might actually worsen the imbalance between revenues and expenses that Bush pointed to as a looming problem; and partly because of the problems encountered by the United Kingdom's privatized pension plan. See Social Security debate (United States). In addition, many Democrats opposed changes that they felt were turning Social Security into a <b>welfare</b> <b>program</b> that would be politically vulnerable. Portions of Bush's bill exempting private companies from social security payments have led to complaints that Bush's plan was created to benefit private companies, and that it would turn Social Security into just another insurance program.|$|E
25|$|The mutineers had {{produced}} a 22-point demand, including {{the withdrawal of}} seconded regular army officers from the BDR. Instead, they wanted original BDR members to be promoted from the ranks. They demanded that their officials be {{selected on the basis}} of the Bangladesh Civil Service examination. While speaking to private television networks, BDR jawans alleged that senior officials of BDR were involved in a conspiracy, accusing the army officers of embezzling soldiers' wage bonuses from the Operation Dal-Bhaat Program and from extra duties in the general elections held on 29 December 2008. Operation Dal-Bhaat was a <b>welfare</b> <b>program</b> run by the BDR to provide rice and other daily essentials to the poor. Other demands included 100% rationing, introduction of BDR soldiers in peacekeeping missions and the overall welfare of BDR members.|$|E

25|$|As a back-up position, in 1965 Johnson {{turned his}} focus to {{hospital}} insurance {{for the aged}} under Social Security. The key player in initiating this program, named Medicare, was Wilbur Mills, Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. In order to reduce Republican opposition, Mills suggested that Medicare be fashioned as a three layer cake—hospital insurance under Social Security, a voluntary insurance program for doctor visits and an expanded medical <b>welfare</b> <b>program</b> for the poor, known as Medicaid. The bill passed the house {{by a margin of}} 110 votes on April 8. The effort in the Senate was considerably more complicated; however, the Medicare bill passed Congress on July 28 after negotiation in a conference committee. Medicare now covers tens of millions of Americans. Johnson gave the first two Medicare cards to former President Harry S Truman and his wife Bess after signing the Medicare bill at the Truman Library in Independence, Missouri.|$|E
25|$|The LDS Church {{stresses}} the importance of worldwide humanitarian service. The church's welfare and humanitarian efforts are coordinated by LDS Philanthropies (LDSP), a church department {{under the direction of the}} Presiding Bishopric. Welfare efforts, originally initiated during the Great Depression, provide aid for the poor, financed by donations from church members. LDSP is also responsible for philanthropic donations to the LDS Church and other affiliated charities, such as the Church History Library, the Church Educational System—which includes Brigham Young University, the Perpetual Education Fund, and the Polynesian Cultural Center—the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, and efforts dedicated to providing funds for LDS missionaries and temple construction. Donations are also used to operate bishop's storehouses, which package and store food for the poor at low cost. Distribution of funds and food is administered by local bishops. These local storehouses distribute commodities to the needy as requested by local bishops on a specified form. Bishop's storehouses also provide service opportunities for those receiving assistance and for those desiring to serve missions or to volunteer in the church's <b>welfare</b> <b>program.</b> The day-to-day operations of the storehouses are typically run by senior-aged missionaries as store managers.|$|E

[...] Along with many other progressive Jews of the day, such as Emma Lazarus, Louis Brandeis, Albert Einstein, and Franz Oppenheimer, Herzl desired to enact the land reforms proposed by the American political economist Henry George.

2500|$|Bolsa Família is {{a social}} <b>welfare</b> <b>program</b> of the Brazilian government. The program {{attempts}} to both reduce short-term poverty by direct cash transfers and fight long-term poverty by increasing human capital among the poor through conditional cash transfers. It also works to give free education to children who cannot afford {{to go to school}} to show the importance of education. The part of the program that is about direct welfare benefits could perhaps best be described as a basic income with some prerequisites. Families with children, to be eligible for the income, must ensure that their children attend school and have been vaccinated. The Bolsa Familia program has been mentioned as one factor contributing to the reduction of poverty in Brazil, which fell 27.7% during the first term in the Lula administration. About 12 million Brazilian families receive funds from Bolsa Família, which has been described as [...] "the largest programme {{of its kind in the}} world." ...|$|E

2500|$|During her husband's {{years in}} power, the {{official}} press made Maria Antonescu {{the object of}} reverence, prompting speculation that she was vying for popularity with Queen Helen. She was the sole subject of two nationally-released films, and an obligatory presence on weekly newsreels. Another propaganda film about Romanian charities was censored {{and had to be}} redone, because officials felt that it shed too much positive light on the Red Cross, and not enough on the Blue Cross. Her omnipresence in press reports alienated the public, and, in 1943, she acknowledged that the society, especially [...] "the lower class", was becoming overexposed to her Blue Cross propaganda, and that [...] "the workers are turning against the Patronage Council". According to Revista de Igienă Socială, Antonescu's Council was highly inefficient at targeting people in need, [...] "especially so in the provinces", and its generous <b>welfare</b> <b>program,</b> that [...] "promoted vice", ought to have been replaced with conditional cash transfers.

Operación Milagro (Operation Miracle) is a joint health program between Cuba and Venezuela, set up in 2005. The Venezuelan Medical Federation has criticized the appointment of Cuban doctors to high-ranking positions, and protests {{have taken place in}} the capital Caracas by Venezuelan medical staff who fear that the Cubans are a threat to Venezuelan jobs. Questions have also been raised by protesters about the level of Cuban medical qualifications, and there have been claims that the Cubans are [...] "political agents" [...] who have come to Venezuela to indoctrinate the workforce. Opposition supporters in Venezuela have called Cuban doctors [...] "Fidel's ambassadors" [...] and refused to go to their clinics.
