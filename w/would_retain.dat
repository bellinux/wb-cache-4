5|$|The land in question, {{which had}} been part of the Seneca Nation's {{traditional}} territory for centuries before the American Revolution, comprised part of the Phelps and Gorham Purchase, a tract of land disputed after the war between claims of New York and Massachusetts. By a December 16, 1786 interstate compact, the states agreed that Massachusetts <b>would</b> <b>retain</b> the proprietary rights and the pre-emption rights, but New York <b>would</b> <b>retain</b> governmental rights. After the adoption of the United States Constitution in 1787, the federal government ratified their compact.|$|E

5|$|A {{hypothesis}} for {{the high}} metal content in SMR dwarf stars is that material enriched in heavy elements fell into the atmosphere from a protoplanetary disk. This would pollute the star's external layers, resulting in a higher than normal metallicity. The lack of a deep convection zone {{would mean that the}} outer layers <b>would</b> <b>retain</b> higher abundance ratios of these heavy elements.|$|E
5|$|McBride's {{tenure as}} owner was viewed favorably, {{partly because of}} the Browns' on-field success but also because he gave Paul Brown a free hand to coach and sign players. One of the new {{ownership}} group's first acts was to assure Cleveland fans that Brown <b>would</b> <b>retain</b> complete control over the football side of the operation.|$|E
5|$|On October 1, 2007, Microsoft and Bungie {{announced}} that Bungie was splitting off from its parent {{and becoming a}} privately held limited liability company named Bungie, LLC.

Stuart Elliott played some of the drums and would become her main drummer on subsequent albums.|$|E
5|$|Ecgbert's {{problems}} with the monasteries in his diocese came from the secular practice of families setting up monasteries that were totally under their control {{as a way of}} making the family lands book-land and free from secular service. Book-land was at first an exclusive right of ecclesiastical property. By transferring land to a family-controlled monastery, the family <b>would</b> <b>retain</b> the use of the land without having to perform any services to the king for the land.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by Protestant supporters, {{including}} several in the Cathedral chapter, he declared he <b>would</b> <b>retain</b> the electorate, and in December 1582, he formally announced his conversion to the reformed {{faith and the}} parity of Calvinism with Catholicism in the Electorate and archdiocese of Cologne.

5|$|For {{the first}} 10,000 years, the EPA <b>would</b> <b>retain</b> the 2001 final rule’s dose limit of 15millirem per year. This is {{protection}} {{at the level}} of the most stringent radiation regulations in the U.S. today. From 10,000 to one million years, EPA established a dose limit of 100millirem per year. EPA's rule requires the Department of Energy to show that Yucca Mountain can safely contain wastes, considering the effects of earthquakes, volcanic activity, climate change, and container corrosion, over one million years. The current analysis indicates that the repository will cause less than 1mrem/year public dose through 1,000,000 years.|$|E
5|$|In 1950 Merrifield took a post as {{assistant}} {{keeper of the}} Guildhall Museum in London, a job that he <b>would</b> <b>retain</b> until 1975. At the time the museum lacked premises, and Merrifield assisted its keeper, Norman Cook, in establishing an exhibit at the Royal Exchange in 1954. During these post-war years the city's archaeological community was largely preoccupied with salvaging Roman and medieval structures damaged in the Blitz, and by subsequent urban redevelopment.|$|E

5|$|On September 22, 2017, Chelsea Manning {{was denied}} entry to Canada from the United States {{because of her}} {{criminal}} record.

Manning told Reuters that she had planned to vacation in Montreal and Vancouver, but was stopped at a Quebec border crossing by the Canada Border Services Agency {{on the evening of}} September 21 and detained overnight. She said she <b>would</b> <b>retain</b> a Canadian lawyer to challenge the inadmissibility finding before a Canadian tribunal.|$|E
5|$|The British {{continued}} their policy of stalling Smith. At {{the end of}} August 1965, they did not consider a Rhodesian UDI an immediate threat, and therefore focussed on the colony's maintained defiance of the mother country regarding Reedman and Lisbon. On 30 August, Johnston summarised Britain's stand on the issue for Bottomley's Commonwealth Relations Office. According to his understanding, he said, Rhodesia had been told just before Federal dissolution that it <b>would</b> <b>retain</b> the Federation's former powers regarding external affairs, but that this entrustment was subject to British discretion, {{and could not be}} exercised without extensive prior consultation and conformity to Britain's line.|$|E

The tower then remained the headquarters of Bond's companies until their collapse. The tower has also been the headquarters of Western Australia's state bank, Bankwest (formerly known as the R Bank), between its completion and 2012.|$|E
