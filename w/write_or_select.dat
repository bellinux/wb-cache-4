30|$|The celebrities’ pictures, showing {{emotional}} expressions, {{were adapted}} from IMBD popular Hollywood {{actors and actresses}} (Engerror, 2013), and Gaines’s (2016) list of popular athletes in the world. The stimuli included multiple expressions to show happiness, sadness, fear, and pride which were considered appropriate for the psychological experiment. The sound appeal drivers were adapted from common sound clips heard in online advertisements (Appendix 2) which were adapted from Lewis et al. (2012), adjusted according {{to the nature of}} the study. The participants were offered headphones to listen to the sound stimulus via lab assisted computers. Photoscape 3.7 was provided as a tool to adjust the picture quality and color tone, and open access to the internet was arranged to <b>write</b> <b>or</b> <b>select</b> a message of any kind which the participants wanted to incorporate while developing the advertisements. McLeod’s (2008) guidelines were followed to conduct the psychological experiment in this empirical study. The researchers controlled the laboratory environment to ensure that lighting and noise were at comfortable levels.|$|E

The majority of the soundtrack was edited directly from various international lounge and dance LP records from the 1960s-1980s, {{many of which were}} part of the music supervisors' personal collections.

The texts it published were <b>written</b> <b>or</b> <b>selected</b> by W. B. Yeats, who was the press's literary editor and who also subsidized its operations, which lacked profitability. In its prospectus issued early in 1903, the press boasted of [...] "a good eighteenth century fount of type" [...] and [...] "paper made of linen rags and without bleaching chemicals".|$|R
5000|$|Entrance {{themes are}} often {{tailored}} to the gimmick of the wrestler they are <b>written</b> <b>or</b> <b>selected</b> for. For example, Jacob and Eli Blu (The Blu Brothers) had an entrance theme in the World Wrestling Federation that resembled a piece of blues music, while The Undertaker has often used entrance themes which resemble a dirge, including the ringing of an eerie bell and a quote of Chopin's Funeral March. In practice, modern day entrance themes are normally rock, rap, or R&B (especially for women), as these genres of music are popular with the professional wrestling key demographics.|$|R
6000|$|... [1] The titles to the Psalms have puzzled all the commentators. Bunyan follows Luther; who adds, {{that the}} {{title to the}} Psalms of Degrees does not pertain to any doctrine, but only to the {{ceremony}} of the singers. Ainsworth applies it to the place or tone of voice of the singers, or to a special excellency of the Psalm. Calmet and Bishop Horsley consider that the title refers to {{the progress of the}} soul towards eternal felicity, ascending by degrees. Watford imagines that these Psalms were <b>written</b> <b>or</b> <b>selected</b> to be sung on the ascent of the Jews from the captivity in Babylon. Luther wisely concludes that the Christian has only to do with the brief and very notable doctrine contained in these fifteen steps or degrees.--Ed.|$|R
500|$|In the 1860s and 1870s ever larger {{forces were}} assembled. Bernard Shaw, {{in his role}} as a music critic, commented, [...] "The stale wonderment which the great chorus never fails to elicit has already been exhausted"; he later wrote, [...] "Why, instead of wasting huge sums on the multitudinous {{dullness}} of a Handel Festival does not somebody set up a thoroughly rehearsed and exhaustively studied performance of the Messiah in St James's Hall with a chorus of twenty capable artists? Most of us would be glad to hear the work seriously performed once before we die." [...] The employment of huge forces necessitated considerable augmentation of the orchestral parts. Many admirers of Handel believed that the composer would have made such additions, had [...] the appropriate instruments been available in his day. Shaw argued, largely unheeded, that [...] "the composer may be spared from his friends, and the function of <b>writing</b> <b>or</b> <b>selecting</b> 'additional orchestral accompaniments' exercised with due discretion." ...|$|R

An exposure level of 0. 003 J/sq cm at 0. 488 micron produces a 1 % diffraction efficiency in a 5 -mm length of crystal. In addition to high recording sensitivity, SBN 75 / 25 exhibits interesting electric-field induced effects that include electric-field enhanced recording sensitivity and voltage-switchable latent-to-active holographic reconstruction efficiency. These effects are {{explained in terms of}} drift and diffusion of photoionized carriers coupled with the nonlinear electrooptic behavior characteristic of this low Curie temperature ferroelectric crystal. A mechanism is proposed that correlates the observed electrically controlled holographic response with the dielectric behavior of the crystal. These interesting effects are used to implement a novel, layered optical memory having no moving parts and having electrical access for <b>writing</b> <b>or</b> reading <b>selected</b> layers...|$|R

500|$|Meanwhile, the NSDAP began passing laws to marginalize Jews {{and remove}} them from German society. The Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, passed on 7 April 1933, forced all non-Aryans {{to retire from}} the legal {{profession}} and civil service. Similar legislation soon deprived Jewish members of other professions {{of their right to}} practise. The first Nazi concentration camps (initially created to house political dissenters) were founded shortly after Hitler seized power. In a process termed Gleichschaltung (co-ordination), the NSDAP proceeded to rapidly bring all aspects of life under control of the party. All civilian organisations, including agricultural groups, volunteer organisations, and sports clubs, had their leadership replaced with Nazi sympathisers or party members. By June 1933, virtually the only organisations not in the control of the NSDAP were the army and the churches. In a move to manipulate Germany's middle class and shape popular opinion, the regime passed on 4 October 1933 the Schriftleitergesetz (Editor's Law), which became the cornerstone of the Nazi Party's control of the popular press. Modeled to some extent on the system in Benito Mussolini's Italy, the law defined a Schriftleiter as anyone who <b>wrote,</b> edited, <b>or</b> <b>selected</b> texts and/or illustrated material for serial publication. Individuals selected for this position were chosen based on experiential, educational, and racial criteria. The law required journalists to [...] "regulate their work in accordance with National Socialism as a philosophy of life and as a conception of government." ...|$|R
5000|$|Florian's solo {{music was}} {{included}} on the 1973 split EP Muzică folk ("Folk Music"), which he shared with Saftiuc, then, in 1975, on the single Pădure liniştitoare/La făgădău' de piatră/Cu pleoapa de argint ("Quieting Forest/At the Stone Tavern/With the Silver Eyelid"). The songs, recorded with Chifiriuc, Reininger and Căciulă, were based on texts <b>written</b> by Florian <b>or</b> <b>selected</b> from Romanian folklore, particularly hajduk songs. The instrumental arrangement comprised a wide assortment of instruments: acoustic guitar, flute, drum kit, cobza, jaw harp, idiophones (all played by Florian himself), alongside electric guitar, tabla, conga, electric piano, celesta, synthesizer and electronic organ. Mihai Plămădeală describes the result as a unique project in Romanian music: [...] "Nothing {{of what can be}} listened to or heard on it finds a direct correspondent in anything that anyone, anywhere, has achieved." [...] He notes Florian's fusion of [...] "hippie culture", [...] "mantra" [...] singing and the [...] "maximal liberty of progressive rock". Reputedly, Florian remains the first Romanian singer to have employed the synthesizer in one of their works.|$|R
