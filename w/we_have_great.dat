500|$|The tenth {{season was}} the second during which Mike Scully served as show runner (he had {{previously}} run the ninth season). As show runner and executive producer, Scully headed the writing staff and oversaw {{all aspects of the}} show's production. However, as he told UltimateTV in January 1999, he did not [...] "make any decisions without the staff's input. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>great</b> staffs in all the departments from animation to writing. So I don't want to make it sound like a dictatorship." [...] Scully was popular with the staff members, many of whom have praised his organization and management skills. Writer Tom Martin has said that he was [...] "quite possibly the best boss I've ever worked for" [...] and [...] "a great manager of people". Scully's aim while running The Simpsons was to [...] "not wreck the show". In addition to his role as show runner during the tenth season, he co-wrote the episode [...] "Sunday, Cruddy Sunday".|$|E

In a January 2007 interview with The Bulletin, Barnes spoke passionately about Australian rock musicians saying: [...] "Australian bands for me {{will always have}} the grunt. Grunt is what gives you longevity, strength, the power to believe in yourself. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>great</b> bands here because they play live, they cut their teeth playing to people.". In March 2008, Barnes appeared as a special guest during soul singer Guy Sebastian's tour.|$|E

Hopefully this win and everything getting ready to start with the Chase is going to put all the pieces together, and I think everybody has been working hard to do that." [...] In regards to the double burnout he did with Tony Stewart following the race, he said he [...] "wanted him to go on a victory lap with so he could say goodbye to all the fans here at Bristol but that was pretty cool doing some burnouts with him." ...|$|E

Mongolia and Tibet's life and death are China's life and death. China absolutely cannot cause Mongolia and Tibet to break away from China's territory, and Mongolia and Tibet cannot reject China to become independent. At this time, {{there is not a single}} nation on earth except China that will sincerely develop Mongolia and Tibet." ...|$|E
