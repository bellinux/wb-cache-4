500|$|The main {{criticism}} Christian Scientists face is {{that their}} children are denied equal protection under the law. Sick and disabled children have been told the only thing <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> is [...] "incorrect" [...] thinking, and practitioners have told parents that the parents' thoughts can harm their children. The church maintains that members are free to choose medical care, but several have said they fear ostracism. The American Academy of Pediatrics regards failure to seek medical care for children as [...] "child neglect, regardless of the motivation." ...|$|E
500|$|Determined {{to improve}} his family's behavior, Homer {{attempts}} {{to get them to}} sit at the table properly, which goes awry as the family prefers to eat while watching TV. When Marge, Bart and Lisa claim there's nothing <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>them,</b> he decides to prove to them that there is something wrong. He takes them {{on a tour of the}} neighborhood, peeking through living room windows to observe how happy families spend time together. The rest of the Simpsons are unnerved by Homer's sudden rash behavior along with unnecessarily spying on their neighbors and retreat quickly back to the safety of their own home. Depressed by the outing, he stops by Moe's Tavern for a drink. After getting into a fight with Barney, Homer later sees a commercial for Dr. Marvin Monroe's Family Therapy Center. Dr. Monroe guarantees [...] "family bliss or double your money back." [...] This gives Homer an idea {{to improve his}} family's behavior.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} disorders of consciousness goes by the name anosognosia, a Greek-derived term meaning unawareness of disease. [...] This is a condition in which patients are disabled in some way, most commonly {{as a result of a}} stroke, but either misunderstand the nature of the problem or deny that there is anything <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> [...] The most frequently occurring form is seen in people who have experienced a stroke damaging the parietal lobe in the right hemisphere of the brain, giving rise to a syndrome known as hemispatial neglect, characterized by an inability to direct action or attention toward objects located to the left with respect to their bodies. [...] Patients with hemispatial neglect are often paralyzed on the right side of the body, but sometimes deny being unable to move. [...] When questioned about the obvious problem, the patient may avoid giving a direct answer, or may give an explanation that doesn't make sense. [...] Patients with hemispatial neglect may also fail to recognize paralyzed parts of their bodies: [...] one frequently mentioned case is of a man who repeatedly tried to throw his own paralyzed right leg out of the bed he was lying in, and when asked what he was doing, complained that somebody had put a dead leg into the bed with him. [...] An even more striking type of anosognosia is Anton–Babinski syndrome, a rarely occurring condition in which patients become blind but claim to be able to see normally, and persist in this claim in spite of all evidence to the contrary.|$|E

60|$|The Canadian is, as a rule, {{a sturdy}} imperialist with {{democratic}} tendencies, {{a type of}} citizen which would elsewhere probably be thought an anachronism. There were, however, as Sewell had pointed out, a good many men in the North just then who had no country, and a vague unrest and discontent, that once or twice came near producing unpleasant results, spread sporadically across the wilderness that season. Nobody {{was pleased with the}} mining regulations, and there were quiet Canadian bushmen who thought the drafting of detachments of the Northwest Police into that country not only unnecessary, but a reflection upon them. There were also other men, who had carried the memory of their <b>wrongs</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> from lands ruled by the mailed fist, to whom this symbol of imperial authority was as a red rag to a bull, and here and there a heavy responsibility was laid on the agents of the Crown.|$|R
2500|$|Australia {{therefore}} {{approached the}} first Test as clear favourites. Martin Johnson of The Independent {{wrote that the}} English team [...] "had only three things <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> - can't bat, can't bowl, can't field". Australia selected two left-arm fast bowlers - Bruce Reid and Chris Matthews (both from Western Australia) - {{to take advantage of}} the clear problem the English batsmen had with this sort of bowling.|$|E
2500|$|Although [...] "severely {{elevated}} mood" [...] sounds somewhat {{desirable and}} enjoyable, {{the experience of}} mania is ultimately often quite unpleasant and sometimes disturbing, if not frightening, for the person involved and for those close to them, and it may lead to impulsive behaviour that may later be regretted. [...] It can also often be complicated by the sufferer's lack of judgment and insight regarding periods of exacerbation of characteristic states. [...] Manic patients are frequently grandiose, obsessive, impulsive, irritable, belligerent, and frequently deny anything is <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> [...] Because mania frequently encourages high energy and decreased perception of need or ability to sleep, {{within a few days}} of a manic cycle, sleep-deprived psychosis may appear, further complicating the ability to think clearly. [...] Racing thoughts and misperceptions lead to frustration and decreased ability to communicate with others.|$|E
2500|$|... "Disorders of sex development" [...] (DSD) is a contested term, defined {{to include}} {{congenital}} {{conditions in which}} development of chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomical sex is atypical. Members of the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society and the European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology adopted this term in their [...] "Consensus statement on management of intersex disorders". While it adopted the term, to open [...] "many more doors", the now defunct Intersex Society of North America itself remarked that intersex is not a disorder. Other intersex people, activists, supporters, and academics have contested {{the adoption of the}} terminology and its implied status as a [...] "disorder", seeing this as offensive to intersex individuals who do not feel that there is something <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>them,</b> regard the DSD consensus paper as reinforcing the normativity of early surgical interventions, and criticizing the treatment protocols associated with the new taxonomy.|$|E

The self-indulgent cleric concentrates on feeding himself, {{and when he does}} decide to give the [...] "crumbs from his table" [...] to Lazarillo, he says, [...] "toma, come, triunfa, para tí es el mundo" [...] "take, eat, triumph - the world is yours" [...] a clear parody of a key communion statement.|$|R

500|$|Though Cochrane {{argues that}} nonhuman animals {{are not the}} victim of an {{injustice}} {{simply because they are}} owned, he claims that ownership of an animal must be understood as not entailing absolute control over said animal. He conceptualises owned animals as [...] "individual sentient creatures with interests of their own". In understanding owned animals in this way, he challenges alternative accounts that frame owned animals variously as living artifacts, slaves, co-citizens or beings who have strategically situated themselves alongside humans. In Animal Rights Without Liberation, Cochrane argues that there is nothing intrinsically <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> using or owning animals, and so, as long as their interests are respected, there is nothing intrinsically <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> using <b>them,</b> for example, in scientific tests, or for agricultural purposes. Ahlhaus and Niesen characterise the book as a whole as a critique of Singer's Animal Liberation, saying that the former explores the latter's [...] "undeclared premise that liberation is what animals want or need".|$|R
40|$|Let’s {{make three}} assumptions. First, we shouldn’t support factory farms. Second, if {{animal-friendly}} agriculture {{lives up to}} its name—that is, if animals live good lives (largely free of pain, able to engage in species-specific behaviors, etc.) and are slaughtered in a way that minimizes suffering—then there is nothing intrinsically <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> killing <b>them</b> for food. Third, animal-friendly agriculture does, in fact, live up to its name. Given these assumptions, it might seem difficult to criticize individuals who source their animal products from “animal-friendly agricultural operations. However, I argue that they should drastically reduce their support for animal-friendly agriculture because it isn’t scalable—i. e., if we were to switch to that form of agriculture, most people would be priced out of its products. I say that it’s wrong to support a solution to a moral problem without sharing its costs...|$|R

60|$|I {{must say}} that I {{was fascinated by the}} perfect lines of Wolf Larsen’s figure, and by what I may term the terrible beauty of it. I had noted the men in the forecastle. Powerfully muscled though some of them were, there had been {{something}} <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> all of <b>them,</b> an insufficient development here, an undue development there, a twist or a crook that destroyed symmetry, legs too short or too long, or too much sinew or bone exposed, or too little.

From that my thoughts went to the indefinable queerness of the deformed man on the beach. I never saw such a gait, such odd motions as he pulled at the box. I recalled that none of these men had spoken to me, though most of them I had found looking at me {{at one time or another}} in a peculiarly furtive manner, quite unlike the frank stare of your unsophisticated savage.

A little, curved, lop-sided man, with his head on one side and with the shrewdest and wickedest of faces and pale blue eyes, addressed an obscene remark to the mad Irishman, calling him O'Sullivan. But O'Sullivan took no notice and muttered on.
