50|$|The {{alternatives}} to using masterbatches are buying a fully compounded material (which {{may be more}} expensive and less open to e.g. color variability of the product), or compounding from raw materials on site (which is prone to issues with achieving full dispersion of the colorants and additives, and prone to preparing more material than <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> the production run). In comparison with pure pigments, masterbatches require more storage space and their lead times are longer. Another disadvantage is additional exposure of heat ("heat history") to both the carrier and the additive; this may be important e.g. for marginally thermally stable pigments.|$|E
50|$|Many CD replicators now accept regular CD-R discs {{in place}} of true PMCDs, which can be created using {{specialized}} Audio CD pre-mastering software. Unfortunately, CD-Rs formatted as “Audio CDs,” which really are Red Book-formatted Orange Book discs, are not designed for disc replication, only content distribution. The CIRC error correction used for the audio data on these discs is not as extensive as <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> CD-ROM or DVD formats so, corruption of the audio data during readout due to dirt or mechanical damage could result in total loss of the audio data.

50|$|There is some {{question}} of whether <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> the market portfolio really matters. Some authors say {{that it does not}} make a big difference; you can use any old index and get similar results. Roll gave an example where different indexes produce much different results, and that by choosing the index you can get any ranking you want. Brown and Brown examine this, using different indexes such as stocks only, stocks and bonds, and stocks plus bonds plus real estate. They find that using a market that includes real estate produces much different results. For example, with one measurement most mutual funds have alpha close to zero, while with another measurement most of them have significantly negative alpha.|$|E

50|$|A {{mountain}} bike built for dirt jumping tends {{to have a}} smaller frame than <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> other disciplines. Running singlespeed with one brake is very common. using single or dual disc brakes has replaced the use of only one rear V-brake. In general, a {{mountain bike}} dedicated to dirt jumping will have 24- or 26-inch wheels, a gear ratio of approximately 60 gear inches (~36:15 on a 24-inch rear wheel or ~36:16 on a 26-inch rear wheel) and rigid or 80-100mm travel forks. An 'all-round' bike used for dirt jumping will more likely have 26-inch wheels, a 25-36 tooth chainring with a wide-ratio cassette and a short- to mid-travel fork. Mountain bike dirt jumpers are usually split {{on the basis of}} wheel size because the wheel size dictates the shape of the takeoff to an extent.|$|E
50|$|Before the 19th century, Balochi was {{an unwritten}} language. The {{official}} written language was Persian, although Balochi was still spoken at the Baloch courts. British linguists and political historians wrote from with the Latin script, but following {{the independence of}} Pakistan, Baloch scholars adopted Urdu Arabic script. The first collection of poetry in Balochi, Gulbang by Mir Gul Khan Nasir was published in 1951 and incorporated the Urdu Arabic Script. But it was much later that Sayad Zahurshah Hashemi wrote a comprehensive guidance on the usage of Urdu Arabic script and standardized it as the Balochi Orthography in Pakistan and Iran. This earned Sayad Hashemi the title of 'the Father of Balochi'. Sayad's guidances are widely used in Eastern and Western Balochistan. In Afghanistan, however, Balochi is written in a modified Arabic script based on <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> Persian.|$|E
50|$|In New South Wales {{the most}} {{destructive}} pest to waratah crops is the macadamia twig girdler (Neodrepta luteotactella). The damage {{is caused by}} the larvae and damage generally first shows at a branch fork or leaf. The condition is generally confined to young shrubs or trees. The leaves are skeletonised and the larvae web them together into a shelter that incorporates larval faeces. Larvae can also burrow into the developing flower head, obliterating a crop entirely if left uncontrolled. Biological control methods include encouragement of bird species. The borer is present throughout the year and so pesticide treatments with a strong persistent spray should be carried out monthly. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> the borer should also control lesser pests such as white scale, which is common in the natural state, and Macadamia leafminer (Acocercops chionosema). Leafminer poses no threat {{to the life of the}} plant but it is preferred that stems for the market still have leaves attached. Thus damaged leaves lower the value of the crop.

5000|$|The two {{complementary}} {{strands of}} double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) are usually differentiated as the [...] "sense" [...] strand and the [...] "antisense" [...] strand. The DNA sense strand {{looks like the}} messenger RNA (mRNA) {{and can be used}} to read the expected protein code; for example, ATG in the sense DNA may correspond to an AUG codon in the mRNA, encoding the amino acid methionine. However, the DNA sense strand itself is not used to make protein by the cell. It is the DNA antisense strand which serves as the source for the protein code, because, with bases complementary to the DNA sense strand, it is used as a template for the mRNA. Since transcription results in an RNA product complementary to the DNA template strand, the mRNA is complementary to the DNA antisense strand. The mRNA is <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> translation (protein synthesis).Hence, a base triplet 3'-TAC-5' in the DNA antisense strand {{can be used as a}} template which will result in an 5'-AUG-3' base triplet in mRNA (AUG is the codon for methionine, the start codon). The DNA sense strand will have the triplet ATG, which looks just like AUG but will not be used to make methionine because it will not be used to make mRNA. The DNA sense strand is called a [...] "sense" [...] strand not because it will be used to make protein (it won't be), but because it has a sequence that looks like the protein codon sequence.|$|E
