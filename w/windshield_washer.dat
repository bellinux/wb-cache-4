25|$|A {{videotape}} of Pickton's friend Scott Chubb saying Pickton {{had told him}} {{a good way to}} kill a female heroin addict was to inject her with <b>windshield</b> <b>washer</b> fluid. A second tape was played for Pickton, in which an associate named Andrew Bellwood said Pickton mentioned killing prostitutes by handcuffing and strangling them, then bleeding and gutting them before feeding them to pigs.|$|E

50|$|The Ballad of the <b>Windshield</b> <b>Washers</b> (La ballata dei lavavetri) is a 1998 Italian drama film {{directed}} by Peter Del Monte. It {{is based on}} a novel by Edoardo Albinati. It was screened out of competition at the 59th Venice International Film Festival.|$|R
50|$|It has {{different}} underframe for handling larger buffing loads. Some units are fitted with speed recorders and some changes to control electronics. Some units also have data recorders for energy consumption. Some are even fitted with <b>windshield</b> <b>washers.</b> Few {{were provided with}} signalling lamps.|$|R
25|$|Alcohols Commonly {{encountered}} alcohols in {{veterinary medicine}} are isopropanol and methanol found in household products and ethanol from alcoholic beverages. They all pose toxicity to dogs. Isopropanol which {{is found in}} rubbing alcohol has twice the toxicity of ethanol; however methanol {{which can be found}} in <b>windshield</b> <b>washer</b> fluid does not have the same retinal and neuronal toxicity on dogs as it does to humans and primates due to the differences in the way its metabolite formic acid is processed.|$|E
25|$|Some luxury market buyers {{purchased}} {{either the}} Starfires {{or the new}} Toronados in 1966 but the 98 remained the full-size top-of-the-line Oldsmobile. Five models, including a trio of 4-doors were available. Standard equipment included: Turbo-Hydramatic transmission; power steering, brakes, windows and seats; special wheel covers; front and rear seat belts; carpeting; <b>windshield</b> <b>washer</b> and two-speed wipers; foam seat cushions; electric clock and special armrests on selected models. Upholstery was cloth, vinyl and leather. Standard tire size was 8.55 x 14inches. Ninety-Eights were built in Lansing.|$|E
25|$|Methanol (also {{known as}} methyl alcohol, carbinol, wood alcohol, wood naphtha or wood spirits) is a {{chemical}} compound with chemical formula CH3OH. It is the simplest alcohol, {{and is a}} light, volatile, colorless, flammable, poisonous liquid with a distinctive odor that is somewhat milder and sweeter than ethanol (ethyl alcohol). At room temperature, it is a polar solvent and is used as an antifreeze, solvent, fuel, and as a denaturant for ethyl alcohol. It is not popular for machinery, but {{may be found in}} automotive <b>windshield</b> <b>washer</b> fluid, de-icers, and gasoline additives.|$|E
50|$|In {{the built}} environment, central air {{conditioning}} systems in office buildings, hotels, and hospitals are sources of contaminated water. Other places it can dwell include cooling towers used in industrial cooling systems, evaporative coolers, nebulizers, humidifiers, whirlpool spas, hot water systems, showers, <b>windshield</b> <b>washers,</b> fountains, room-air humidifiers, ice-making machines, and misting systems typically found in grocery-store produce sections.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{technically}} a subseries of the Cadillac Series 62 {{based on}} the regular Series 62 convertible, sharing its engine, it was nearly twice as expensive at US$7,750. The 220.8 in long, 80.1 in wide vehicle came with such standard features as <b>windshield</b> <b>washers,</b> a signal seeking radio, power windows, and a heater. The Eldorado comprised only [...]5% of Cadillac's sales in 1953.|$|R
50|$|Fleetwood {{lettering}} {{appeared on}} the rear deck lid trim strip. Single side trim moldings extended from the front wheel housing {{to the rear of}} the car. Standard equipment included power brakes; power steering; Hydramatic automatic transmission; dual back-up lamps; <b>windshield</b> <b>washers</b> and two-speed wipers; wheel discs; dual outside rearview mirror; vanity mirror; oil filter and power vent windows. Power steering and shock absorbers were improved this year. Engine displacement on the Cadillac OHV V8 was increased to 390 cuin L.|$|R
25|$|Lens {{cleaning}} systems come in {{two main}} varieties: a small motor-driven rubber wiper or brush conceptually similar to windshield wipers, or a fixed or telescopic high-pressure sprayer which cleans the lenses with a spray of <b>windshield</b> <b>washer</b> fluid. Most recent lens cleaning systems are of the spray type, because UN regulations do not permit mechanical cleaning systems (wipers) {{to be used with}} plastic-lens headlamps, and most recent headlamps have plastic lenses. Some cars with retractable headlamps, such as the original Mazda MX-5, have a squeegee {{at the front of the}} lamp recess which automatically wipes the lenses as they are raised or lowered, although it does not provide washer fluid.|$|E
25|$|The {{prototype}} car, SP 618000 {{was turned}} out in December, 1968 and tested through 1969. Chevrolet conducted vibration and low-speed crash tests to make sure nose-down Vegas wouldn't shift or be damaged in railcar collisions. Chevrolet's goal was to deliver Vegas topped with fluids and ready {{to drive to the}} dealership. To do this Vega engineers had to design a special engine oil baffle to prevent oil from entering the No. 1 cylinder, batteries had filler caps located high up on the rear edge of the case to prevent acid spilling, the carburetor float bowl had a special tube that drained gasoline into the vapor canister during shipment, and the <b>windshield</b> <b>washer</b> bottle stood at a 45 degree angle. Plastic spacers were wedged in beside the powertrain to prevent damage to engine and transmission mounts. The wedges were removed when cars were unloaded. The rail car doors were opened and closed by means of a forklift truck.|$|E

50|$|The Flight Hawk was {{a product}} of a Raymond Loewy design. It was based on the Champion two-door coupe that was {{introduced}} for the 1953 model year. Like the other 1956 Hawks, the Flight Hawk received a new hood, grille, deck lid, and instrument panel. Flight Hawks otherwise had the minimum amount of exterior chrome. Things like oil filter, backup lamps, radio, clock, <b>windshield</b> <b>washers,</b> outside mirrors, heater, and full hubcaps were available from the factory or could be added through the dealer.|$|R
5000|$|Introduced in 1956 as a {{sub-series}} of the {{top level}} DeSoto Fireflite series, the Adventurer was originally marketed as a limited production two-door hardtop, and available in a white/black/gold color scheme only. The first Adventurer came with a hi-output 341 cubic inch Hemi V8, dual exhausts and custom appointments and trim. Standard trim included dual outside side mirrors, gold wheel covers, radio, electric clock, padded instrument panel, <b>windshield</b> <b>washers,</b> full instrumentation, [...] and heavy duty suspension. A total of 996 cars were sold in its first year.|$|R
2500|$|In 1960, {{once again}} {{the top of the}} line Oldsmobile series was the 98. Standard {{equipment}} included Safety-vee steering wheel, turn signals, air scoop brakes, electric windshield wipers, safety-spectrum speedometer, carpets with rubber inserts, padded dash, courtesy lamps, wheel trim rings, Star-lite headliner, two-speed windshield wipers, chrome roof side moldings, Jetaway Hydramatic transmission, power steering, power brakes, <b>windshield</b> <b>washers,</b> electric clock, and deep twist carpeting.

2500|$|The Rex 550 {{was called}} the Subaru 600 in most export markets. Subaru made much of the [...] "Multi-Use Lever", which {{combined}} the headlight, turn signal, and <b>windshield</b> <b>washer</b> functions. This was not installed on the lowest spec versions (Type B, Standard).|$|E
2500|$|The 1984 {{model year}} saw {{the return of}} the two-door sport coupe making a three model line-up. Styling {{remained}} unchanged. 1984 models were virtually identical to 1981 models. The <b>windshield</b> <b>washer</b> controls were moved from the dashboard to the turn signal stalk to create the multi-stalk. The optional cruise control (which continued to be mounted on the turn signal stalk) now featured acceleration/deceleration in [...] increments. An optional Landau package included a vinyl roof, sport mirrors and reveal moldings.|$|E
2500|$|In 1954, Oldsmobiles were {{redesigned}} {{across the}} line, with a three body style 98 series at the top. Convertibles were dubbed Starfires, after the previous year's Starfire dream car. A slightly higher horsepower [...] Rocket V8 was {{shared with the}} Super 88 series. Standard 98 equipment included bumper guards, rubber simulated carpets front and rear, electric clock, lined trunk, dual horns, cigarette lighter, aluminum door sill plates, turn signals, chrome rocker panel moldings, deck lid ornament, foam rubber seat cushions, padded dash, parking brake light, courtesy light package, stainless steel wheel discs, <b>windshield</b> <b>washer,</b> and Deluxe steering wheel with horn ring.

He made his debut as a writer in 1988, with {{a collection of short stories}} titled Arabeschi della vita morale. His 1989 novel Il polacco lavatore di vetri in was adapted into a film, The Ballad of the <b>Windshield</b> <b>Washers</b> by Peter Del Monte. From the mid-1990s he works at the Rebibbia prison as a teacher. In 2002 and in 2004 he took part to two UN High Commission for Refugees missions in Afghanistan and Chad, also writing several reports published by the newspapers Corriere della Sera and La Repubblica.|$|R
2500|$|In 1952 the 98 {{remained}} {{as the top}} of the line Oldsmobile. The series shared the higher output 160 HP Rocket V8 with the Super 88s. Standard equipment on the three body styles included bumper guards, gray rubber floor mats front and rear, electric clock, dual horns, aluminum door sill plates, chrome gravel guards, foam rubber seat cushions, turn signals, carpeting front and rear, stainless steel wheel trim rings, <b>windshield</b> <b>washer,</b> and Deluxe steering wheel with horn ring. Upholstery selection was broadcloth or six colors of leather. Standard tire size was [...] by [...] For the first time power steering was an option. Another new option was the Autronic Eye, an automatic headlight dimmer, which in its initial year was shared only with Cadillac.|$|E
2500|$|To {{maintain}} a near ideal weight distribution, a rear transaxle is used, {{in addition to}} the mounting of the fuel tank ahead of the rear axle and the radiators at the rear. The <b>windshield</b> <b>washer</b> fluid reservoir is mounted in the center next to the fuel tank to improve further the center of weight. Overall 48% of the LFA's mass is distributed along the front wheels with 52% at the rear. The [...] fuel tank straddles the exhaust system keeping weight centered along the left-right axis. The engine is connected to the transaxle via a rigid carbon-fiber torque tube which the exhaust system runs directly below. This stacked driveshaft and exhaust arrangement decreases the width of the center tunnel allowing for centrally located seating.|$|E
2500|$|Standard {{equipment}} included automatic transmission, {{power steering}} and brakes, power windows, clock, padded dash, foam padded seats, parking brake light, Deluxe steering wheel, special wheel covers, <b>windshield</b> <b>washer</b> and two-speed electric wipers, courtesy and glovebox lamps, and front seat belts. Standard tire size was 8.55 x 14inches. A new three-speed Turbo-Hydramatic automatic transmission with torque converter replaced the dismal three speed Roto Hydramatic that Oldsmobile {{had been using}} {{for the last three}} model years. Along with the transmission and redesigned platform, the engine was also new for 1965. It was a [...] Super Rocket V8 that was more powerful and of a more efficient design than the older [...] Rocket V8 previously used, yet it was much lighter in weight. The 98's standard and only engine offering for 1965 was the four-barrel [...] "Ultra High Compression" [...] version of the 425 Super Rocket rated at [...] Ninety-Eights were built only in Lansing.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{differences}} between the Calais and the De Ville were trim levels and standard equipment. While the De Ville was delivered with such amenities as power windows and 2-way power seats as standard equipment, hand-cranked windows were standard on the Calais, with power a US$119 option. At the same time, however, AM radio was a US$165 extra, as was air conditioning, at US$495, on either. Standard equipment included power brakes; power steering; automatic transmission; dual back-up lights; <b>windshield</b> <b>washers</b> and dual speed wipers; full wheel discs; remote controlled outside rear view mirror; visor vanity mirror; oil filter; five tubeless black tires; heater; defroster; lamps for luggage, glove and rear passenger compartments; cornering lights and front and rear seat belts.|$|R
2500|$|Again in 1956 {{the top of}} {{the line}} Oldsmobile 98 series had an {{exclusive}} [...] wheelbase, [...] longer than the 88.

50|$|All 1954 Cadillacs wore new sheet metal, but {{unfortunately}} the $4,683 Sixty Special still looked {{too much like}} its lower-priced sibling, the Series 62. Wheelbase for Sixty Special was back up to 133 in - {{where it had been}} in 1949. Refined power steering, from Saginaw, became standard equipment, along with electric <b>windshield</b> <b>washers.</b> New options included a four-way electrically power bench seat, and power brakes from Bendix. As they had been doing since its introduction in 1949, Cadillac was able to pull more power out of its 331 cuin L engine, and now it was rated at 230. The eight chrome trim louvers moved lower onto the rear doors, back where they were in 1952. Sales dropped to 16,200 this year - down from 20,000 in 1953.|$|R
2500|$|For 1961 only, it {{was renamed}} Classic 98; nevertheless, most factory {{literature}} {{refers to the}} line as the Ninety-Eight. It offered five body styles. The sedan was now called the Town Sedan. The 4-door 4-window hardtop body style was now called the Sport Sedan instead of the Holiday Sedan. A new 4-door 6-window hardtop body style, previously exclusive to Cadillac and the Buick Electra was now offered and the Holiday Sedan name was transferred to it. This {{was the first time}} not all Oldsmobile hardtops were called Holidays. Overall sales plunged from 59,364 to 43,010, probably due to the introduction of the new Starfire series, the 98's low point following the production record set in 1955. Standard equipment included padded dash, Safety spectrum speedometer, floating propeller, air scoop brakes, two-speed windshield wipers, Safety-Vee steering wheel, parking brake lamp, courtesy lamps, oil filter, <b>windshield</b> <b>washer,</b> electric clock, Roto Hydramatic transmission, power steering and power brakes.

The Hydramatic automatic transmission gear selector had an S on it, which was used for better performance climbing hills. At mid-year, Olds introduced the new pillarless four-door hardtop body, dubbed the Holiday sedan, in the 98 series. The 4-door Oldsmobile 98 Holiday, along with the 4-door 88 Holiday and the 4-door Buick Century Riviera and 4-door Special Riviera, were the first 4-door hardtops ever produced. Perhaps because of the popularity of the new 4-door hardtop body style total 98 sales set a new record of 118,626.|$|E

5000|$|The Coandă {{effect is}} used in dual-pattern fluid {{dispensers}} in automobile <b>windshield</b> <b>washers.</b> The operation principle of oscillatory flowmeters also relies on the Coandă phenomenon. The incoming liquid enters a chamber that contains two [...] "islands." [...] Due to the Coandă effect, the main stream splits up and goes {{under one of the}} islands. This flow then feeds itself back into the main stream making it split up again, but {{in the direction of the}} second isle. This process repeats itself as long as the liquid circulates the chamber, resulting in a self-induced oscillation that is directly proportional to the velocity of the liquid and consequently the volume of substance flowing through the meter. A sensor picks up the frequency of this oscillation and transforms it into an analog signal yielding volume passing through.|$|R
25|$|From March, {{features}} such as Xenon headlamps, rain-sensitive <b>windshield</b> wipers, headlight <b>washers,</b> GPS navigation, and upgraded audio became standard for US models.|$|R
