5|$|Games {{are played}} for entertainment—{{sometimes}} purely for entertainment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well. They {{can be played}} alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals. The players may have an audience of non-players, such as <b>when</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> entertained by watching a chess championship. On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play. Often, part of the entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who {{is part of their}} audience and who is a player.|$|E
5|$|It is {{suggested}} that people should avoid jack jumpers, but this is difficult to do. Closed footwear (boots and shoes) along with socks reduce the chances of encountering a sting, but wearing thongs or sandals will put the person at risk. With this said, they are still capable of stinging through fabric, and can find their way through gaps in clothing. Most stings occur <b>when</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> gardening, so taking extra caution or avoiding gardening altogether is recommended. People can also avoid encountering jack jumpers by moving to locations where jack jumper populations are either low or absent, or eliminate nearby nests. Since Myrmecia ants have different venoms, people who are allergic to them are advised {{to stay away from}} all Myrmecia ants, especially to ones they have not encountered before.|$|E

5|$|Wild tigers {{that have}} had no prior contact with humans {{actively}} avoid interactions with humans. However, tigers cause more human deaths through direct attack than any other wild mammal. Attacks are occasionally provoked, as tigers lash out after being injured while they themselves are hunted. Attacks can be provoked accidentally, as when a human surprises a tiger or inadvertently comes between {{a mother and her}} young, or as in a case in rural India when a postman startled a tiger, used to seeing him on foot, by riding a bicycle. Occasionally tigers come to view people as prey. Such attacks are most common in areas where population growth, logging, and farming have put pressure on tiger habitats and reduced their wild prey. Most man-eating tigers are old, missing teeth, and unable to capture their preferred prey. For example, the Champawat Tiger, a tigress found in Nepal and then India, had two broken canines. She was responsible for an estimated 430 human deaths, the most attacks known to be perpetrated by a single wild animal, {{by the time she was}} shot in 1907 by Jim Corbett. According to Corbett, tiger attacks on humans are normally in daytime, <b>when</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> working outdoors and are not keeping watch. Early writings tend to describe man-eating tigers as cowardly because of their ambush tactics.|$|E

25|$|<b>When</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> {{confronted with}} {{unpleasant}} and potentially harmful stimuli such as foul odors or tastes, PET-scans show increased bloodflow in the amygdala. In these studies, the participants also reported moderate anxiety.

25|$|<b>When</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> indoors, {{running to}} windows to {{investigate}} the source of bright flashes in the sky still remains a common and natural response to experiencing a bright flash.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that nonattachment, or the ability to release from mental fixations, has many positive outcomes (Sahdra, Shaver, & Brown, 2010). Because creativity {{is one of the most}} im- portant pro-social behaviors, we investigated the link between nonattachment and creativity. In addi- tion, we investigated the moderating role of mood. We found that nonattachment was indeed positively related to creativity, but only <b>when</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> induced to feel authentic pride, that is, pride which re- sults from attributing success to hard work. The link between nonattachment and creativity disappeared <b>when</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> merely induced to feel a positive or neutral mood...|$|R

These are people who value both {{the experience of being}} part of a group, as well as achieving results. Also, challenging and difficult tasks reduce social loafing. Social loafing is also reduced when individuals are involved in group work and their rewards are received as a team, rather than individually.|$|E

About 50% of people re-administered the MBTI within nine months remain the same overall type and 36% the same type after more than nine months.

25|$|In contrast, {{people with}} {{negative}} self-views {{will find that}} the desire for self-verification and self-enhancement are competing. Consider people who see themselves as disorganized. Whereas their desire for self-enhancement will compel them to seek evidence that others perceive them as organized, their desire for self-verification will compel such individuals to seek evidence that others perceive them as disorganized. Self-verification strivings tend to prevail over self-enhancement strivings <b>when</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> certain of the self-concept and when they have extremely depressive self-views.|$|E
25|$|When Chris dies, he {{experiences}} {{symptoms of}} a near death experience. As pain gradually leaves his body, he observes a tunnel of light and views his dead body from above, connected to himself by a silver cord. He then experiences his life flashing before his eyes, as the events in his life unfold in reverse. This last experience occurs again later, much more slowly, while he's a ghost. Albert later compares it to purgatory, a time <b>when</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> forced to re-examine their lives without rationalization.|$|E
25|$|<b>When</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> healthy, {{the veins}} below their heart quickly constrict {{and the heart}} rate {{increases}} to minimize and compensate for the gravity effect. This is carried out involuntarily by the autonomic nervous system. The system usually requires {{a few seconds to}} fully adjust and if the compensations are too slow or inadequate, the individual will suffer reduced blood flow to the brain, dizziness and potential blackout. Increases in G-loading, such as routinely experienced by aerobatic or combat pilots 'pulling Gs', greatly increases this effect. Repositioning the body horizontally largely eliminates the problem.|$|E

25|$|Like in English, Dutch has {{generalised}} the dative {{over the}} accusative case for all pronouns, e.g. Du me, je, Eng me, you, vs. Germ mich/mir dich/dir. There is one exception: the standard language prescribes {{that in the}} third person plural, hen is to be used for the direct object, and hun for the indirect object. This distinction was artificially introduced in the 17th century by grammarians, and is largely ignored in spoken language and not well understood by Dutch speakers. Consequently, the third person plural forms hun and hen are interchangeable in normal usage, with hun being more common. The shared unstressed form ze is also often used as both direct and indirect objects and is a useful avoidance strategy <b>when</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> unsure which form to use.|$|E
25|$|People facing anxiety may {{withdraw}} from situations which have provoked anxiety in the past. There are {{various types of}} anxiety. Existential anxiety can occur when a person faces angst, an existential crisis, or nihilistic feelings. People can also face mathematical anxiety, somatic anxiety, stage fright, or test anxiety. Social anxiety and stranger anxiety are caused <b>when</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> apprehensive around strangers or other people in general. Furthermore, anxiety has been linked with physical symptoms such as IBS and can heighten other mental health illnesses such as OCD and panic disorder. The {{first step in the}} management of a person with anxiety symptoms is to evaluate the possible presence of an underlying medical cause, whose recognition is essential in order to decide its correct treatment. Anxiety symptoms may be masking an organic disease, or appear associated or {{as a result of a}} medical disorder.|$|E
25|$|In general, Romansh is the {{dominant}} language {{in most of the}} Surselva. In the western areas, the Cadi and the Lumnezia, it is the language of a vast majority, with around 80% naming it as their language of best command, and it often being a daily language for virtually the entire population. In the eastern areas of the Gruob around Ilanz, German is significantly more dominant in daily life, though most people still use Romansh regularly. Romansh is still acquired by most children in the Cadi and Gruob even in villages where Romansh speakers are in the minority, since it is usually the language of instruction in primary education there. Even in villages where Romansh dominates, newcomers rarely learn Romansh however, as Sursilvan speakers quickly accommodate by switching to German, so that there is often little opportunity to practice Romansh even <b>when</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> willing to learn it. Some pressure is often exerted by children, who will sometimes speak Romansh even with their non-Romansh-speaking parents.|$|E
