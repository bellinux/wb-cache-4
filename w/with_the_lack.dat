At Gettysburg, Andy is unhappy <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of morale and belief in his leadership and attempts to make an analogy between running a paper company and fighting in the Civil War. Andy starts to lead a haphazard tour, and eventually most of the office members sit down to rest. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) follow Andy after he presses on, and eventually tell him to stop trying to impress the office. They reinforce the fact that his co-workers like him the way he is.|$|E
5|$|Dead Island, {{originally}} {{announced in}} 2007 by Techland, is an action role-playing survival horror video game. Set in a zombie-infested tropical island called Banoi, the game focuses heavily on melee combat. According to Techland, {{it was a}} game about killing zombies, not a game focused on delivering an emotional experience. Until 2011, Techland declined to give new information regarding the game as requested by the game's publisher, Deep Silver. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of new information surrounding the game, many critics believed that the game had been quietly cancelled. The game was released on February 16, 2011, approximately four years after the game's initial announcement.|$|E

When the {{superior}} Russian force countered, Prussian momentum faltered <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of a second column of timely reinforcement. Repeated assaults on the Russians entrenched in the heights resulted in massive losses for the Prussians. In the last of these assaults, Moritz Franz Kasimir von Wobersnow led eight battalions and six squadrons from Züllichau against the Russian right wing. At the same time his cavalry penetrated the enemy's infantry line, but the Russian cavalry, supported by gun-fire, drove them and the infantry back into the low ground.|$|E

Hurd eventually departed herself to join the drama television series Leap Years. The actress earned some critical praise for her performance as Jeffries, but several commentators said the character was never properly fleshed out.|$|E

Montgomery's kind treatment toward the captured British prisoners caused several officers to express their concern.

Letters from Washington in which Washington also expressed his troubles with the discipline of troops convinced Montgomery to continue his command.|$|E

5|$|Partially {{because of}} the Crewkerne incident, and due to the incessant {{modification}} of Bulleid’s original design, British Railways took the decision to rebuild the entire class to a more conventional design by R. G. Jarvis, adopting many features from the BR 'Standard' locomotive classes that had been introduced since 1950. The air-smoothed casing was removed and replaced with conventional boiler cladding, and the chain-driven valve gear was replaced with three separate sets of Walschaerts valve gear. The rebuilds were provided with a completely revised cylindrical smokebox, a new Lord Nelson-type chimney and LMS-style smoke deflectors. Together <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of air-smoothed casing, these helped reduce the problem of smoke and steam obscuring the driver's vision of the line.|$|E
5|$|Six {{months after}} the NFLPA {{declared}} itself an independent union, many players were dissatisfied <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of compensation teams provided and voted to strike on July 3, 1968 after official discussions with the owners stalled. The owners countered by declaring a lockout. By July 14, 1968, the brief work stoppage came to an end. Although a CBA resulted, many players felt that the agreement did not net them as many benefits as they had hoped. The owners agreed to contribute about $1.5 million to the pension fund with minimum salaries of $9,000 for rookies, $10,000 for veterans and $50 per exhibition game; there was at yet no neutral arbitration for disputes.|$|E
5|$|The average Soviet soldier {{suffered}} from inexperience. With the Soviet debacle {{of the previous}} year ameliorated only by the barest victory at Moscow, most of the original manpower of the Red Army had been killed, wounded or captured by the Germans, with casualties of almost 1,000,000 just from the Battle of Moscow. The typical soldier in the Red Army was a conscript and had little to no combat experience, and tactical training was practically nonexistent. Coupled <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of trained soldiers, the Red Army also began to suffer from the loss of Soviet industrial areas, and a temporary strategic defense was considered necessary.|$|E

5|$|The {{battle between}} Sydney and Kormoran {{is seen as}} controversial: the disbelief that a {{modified}} merchant ship could so successfully defeat a cruiser combined <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of Australian survivors led some {{to believe that the}} German account was false. Rumours that the battle was not what it seemed had been around since Sydney failed to reach Fremantle on schedule in 1941, but several historians (including Tom Frame and Wesley Olson) credit Michael Montgomery and his 1980 book Who Sank The Sydney? with igniting the controversy.|$|E
5|$|The {{news agency}} {{was founded in}} 1937, when the country was still a colony in the Dutch Empire, by {{independence}} activists dissatisfied <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of local coverage by the Dutch-owned Aneta news agency. Antara's operation was absorbed into the Dōmei Tsushin news network following invasion by the Japanese in 1942. Its staff {{played a key role}} in the broadcast of Indonesia's proclamation of independence and assumed control of the Dōmei facilities in the region at the end of the war. The agency remained under private management until it was placed under the control of the presidency in the 1960s when the government shifted its focus from decolonization to nation-building. Antara became an institution through which the state could promote its policies.|$|E
5|$|The prologue to {{the novel}} is Carpentier’s most often quoted text, in which he coins the term lo real maravilloso ("marvellous reality") in {{reference}} to seemingly miraculous occurrences in Latin America.

Furthermore, his trip to Haiti in 1943 is recounted, {{as well as some}} of the research he did to gather facts for the novel. Carpentier also denounces the commonplace and formulaic instances of the marvellous that is found in surrealist novels due to its inorganic and false origins, as opposed to the natural magic that is found in Latin America.|$|E

Of the top 27 articles identified by a review of the international emergency medicine literature from 2010, 14 were classified as dealing with the practice of emergency medicine in resource-constrained environments. A new dimension of thought is that of the isolated subject of technology for trauma care as published in the World Journal of Surgery by Mihir Shah et al. Topics covered included the use of the Broselow tape as the best estimate for children's weight, green bananas as an effective treatment for diarrhea, and misoprostol as a potential alternative for postpartum hemorrhage when oxytocin is not available.|$|E
5|$|As {{minister}} {{in charge of}} the Four Year Plan, Göring became concerned <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of natural resources in Germany, and began pushing for Austria to be incorporated into the Reich. The province of Styria had rich iron ore deposits, and {{the country as a whole}} was home to many skilled labourers that would also be useful. Hitler had always been in favour of a takeover of Austria, his native country. He met on 12 February 1938 with Austrian chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg, threatening invasion if peaceful unification was not forthcoming. The Nazi party was made legal in Austria to gain a power base, and a referendum on reunification was scheduled for March. When Hitler did not approve of the wording of the plebiscite, Göring telephoned Schuschnigg and Austrian head of state Wilhelm Miklas to demand Schuschnigg's resignation, threatening invasion by German troops and civil unrest by the Austrian Nazi Party members. Schuschnigg resigned on 11 March and the plebiscite was cancelled. By 5:30 the next morning, German troops that had been massing on the border marched into Austria, meeting no resistance.|$|E
