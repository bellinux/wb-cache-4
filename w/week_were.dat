25|$|The {{most common}} cause of {{shoulder}} injuries to cricketers is a result of fielding. Overuse of the shoulder when throwing repeatedly during fielding in a cricket game can lead to problems such as tendinitis in the biceps, a tear of the supraspinatus tendon or even degenerative changes to the rotator cuff which could result in a surgery to fix the tear. Impingement, a syndrome that occurs when the rotator cuff muscles are inflamed or irritated, is a major injury risk that can develop amongst bowlers. A 2001–2002 study focused on identifying a workload threshold that would avoid an increased risk in shoulder injuries. The study found that bowlers who produced an average of 123–188 deliveries per <b>week</b> <b>were</b> less likely to face injury whereas bowlers who averaged below 123 deliveries or above 188 deliveries per <b>week</b> <b>were</b> at a greater risk of causing injury.|$|E
