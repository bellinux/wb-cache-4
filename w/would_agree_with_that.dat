50|$|The views {{expressed}} by Donaldson {{on the subject}} of death were far reaching even by cryonics standards http://www.alcor.org/Library/html/ProspectsOfACureForDeath.html. According to Donaldson, as long as the brain continues to exist in some kind of repairable form, “death” was merely a label indicating that the memory and personality information within it were beyond reach of current technology. While all cryonics proponents <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> where today’s technology is concerned, Donaldson went further. Instead of expecting a plateau of “mature nanotechnology” to someday clearly answer whether cryopreserved patients are information theoretically dead, he suggested that increasingly sophisticated methods for decrypting the original information content of injured brains would always keep coming. He wrote of “neural archaeology” as an important part of future medicine. He said cryonics in some form would always be necessary because whether certain brain injuries were ultimately repairable would always remain an open question for the future.|$|E

40|$|Most physics {{teachers}} {{think about}} their courses in terms of topics covered, concepts explained, and principles applied. Our effort in this workshop has been to call your attention to another impartant dimension of physics teaching: your students 2 ̆ 7 patterns of reasoning. By this time, you have probably concluded that most physics courses are addressed primarily to students who can use formal reasoning patterns with ease, and we <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>that.</b> Yet there are also the students who use formal reasoning patterns only with difficulty and in limited areas. To help you analyze course content and present {{it in a way}} that will be understandable to more of your students, we suggest that you classify physics concepts according to the reasoning patterns necessary to understand the meaning you wish to communicate. Concepts may then be called “concrete 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 formal, 2 ̆ 2 in analogy to the stages of reasoning. This module presents examples and explanations of 2 ̆ 2 concrete 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 formal 2 ̆ 2 concepts and is arranged in the form of a learning cycle built around that distinction...|$|E
40|$|The {{stages of}} change {{model has been}} {{advocated}} to assess readiness for adoption and/or maintenance of physical activity. Population-based studies using the model have relied on self-report for initial stage classification. Whether the self-selected stage <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> selected by investigators has not been firmly established. The {{purpose of this study}} was to asses agreement between self-selected and criteria-selected stage classifications. Subjects were volunteers screened for participation in a supervised exercise program (N= 93; 48 men; 45 women) with mean age = 48. 5 ± 14 years. Subjects selected a stage category using the published descriptions of the stages, but were also classified by two criteria using information about either physical activity (Criteria A) or exercise (Criteria B) habits. Stage differences (contemplators thru maintenance) were assessed using a Chi Squared analysis. Significant differences were observed between self-selected and both criteria A and B (Chi Squared = 81. 2 & 78. 0 respectively; P < 0. 0001) selected stages. In addition, there was a significant difference between the two criteria classifications(Chi Squared = 185; P< 0. 0001). These results demonstrate that stage selection varies as a function of the rater, as well as whether it is physical activity or exercise being contrasted within the model stages. Accurate classification is important for designing more efficacious exercise intervention, thus these results identify a problem related to stage selection in the stages of change model.

40|$|Charles Ives is {{commonly}} referred to as the 2 ̆ 2 Father of American Music. 2 ̆ 2 The implication is one that Ives himself <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with,</b> <b>that</b> he wrote purely American ideas from his own environment without reference to other styles or methods, in particular the widespread European tradition. Some composers, like Aaron Copland and Roger Sessions, created an American sonority by incorporating the concepts of musical construction they studied at the Paris Conservatoire. Ives, conversely, received no instruction in Europe, but the techniques so prevalent in the music of the French art song are found in certain songs written by Ives. Though he claimed no European influence, however, he used the late nineteenth century French song style in some of his songs, and he also borrowed tunes from the French composers. This study identifies significant trademarks of eighteenth century French song and the stylistic traits associated with a variety of prominent composers of the time. Ives 2 ̆ 7 s childhood musical influences, his church position, and his studies at Yale University will establish a relationship between Ives and the French musical ideas. The primary source for his songs is his collection entitled 114 Songs. Ives gathered his songs and put them into one collection which included Four French Songs. Through the analysis of several songs, including the four French songs written by Ives and three comparisons of songs by Ives with songs by French composers, it becomes evident that Ives was influenced, to a certain extent, by French music and used many techniques of the style...|$|E
