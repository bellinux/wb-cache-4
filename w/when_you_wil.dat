Ths is a result of very recent discoveries of high {{temperature}} superconductors which may revolutionize everything from electrcal generation and transmission to high-speed cQmputers to controlled fusion generatig plants. In ths experiment, you will investigate the superconductivity of the new Y-Ba-Cu-O compound system as a function of temperature and magnetic field. The most important question should should answer is "What is the resistance of the superconductor as the temperatu and applied magnetic field ar changed? " Other questions which <b>you</b> <b>wil</b> not be able to answer are related to the determination of curent density which can pass through the material and the mechanical strength and elasticity of the material.

40|$|ABSTRACT—Positive affects high in {{approach}} motivational intensity narrow attention. The {{present study}} extended this recent finding by testing whether a neural activation associated with approach-motivation intensity—relative left frontal-central activity—would underlie {{the effect of}} appetitive stimuli on narrowed attention (as measured by local attentional bias). It also tested whether individ-ual differences in approach motivation relate to this attentional narrowing. Results supported predictions, suggesting a common association of relative left frontal hemispheric processing for approach-motivational pro-cesses and narrowed attention.
