5|$|Although Macbeth's wife can {{be traced}} to a {{real-world}} counterpart, Queen Gruoch of Scotland, Shakespeare's fictional character is tied so <b>weakly</b> to her that the bonds are virtually non-existent.|$|E
5|$|I {{set to work}} to slap him as hard as I could. After a moment, my father's eyelids moved {{slightly}} over his glazed eyes. He was breathing <b>weakly.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many other polyiodides may {{be found}} when {{solutions}} containing iodine and iodide crystallise, such as , , , and , whose salts with large, <b>weakly</b> polarising cations such as Cs+ may be isolated.|$|E
5|$|Possibly {{related to}} active galactic nuclei (as well as starburst regions) are low-ionization nuclear {{emission}}-line regions (LINERs). The emission from LINER-type galaxies {{is dominated by}} <b>weakly</b> ionized elements. The excitation sources for the <b>weakly</b> ionized lines include post-AGB stars, AGN, and shocks. Approximately one-third of nearby galaxies are classified as containing LINER nuclei.|$|E
5|$|Qanatir would march {{along the}} coastal route and occupy Beirut, {{from where he}} was to attack <b>weakly</b> defended Damascus from the west to cut off the main Muslim army at Emesa.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{subspecies}} of American robin are recognized. These subspecies intergrade and {{are only}} <b>weakly</b> defined.|$|E
5|$|Azotobacter {{species are}} {{ubiquitous}} in neutral and <b>weakly</b> basic soils, but not acidic soils. They {{are also found}} in the Arctic and Antarctic soils, despite the cold climate, short growing season, and relatively low pH values of these soils. In dry soils, Azotobacter can survive in the form of cysts for up to 24 years.|$|E
5|$|Banksia ilicifolia regenerates after bushfire by regrowing from epicormic shoots {{under its}} bark. Follicles open and release seeds after several years. It is <b>weakly</b> serotinous, like eight other Banksia species, {{all of which}} tend to occur in Western Australia's southwestern corner. The other two species of the {{subgenus}} Isostylis are killed by fire and regenerate by seed.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion is {{also known}} {{to act as a}} non-competitive {{antagonist}} of the α3β2, α3β4, α4β2, and, very <b>weakly,</b> α7 nACh receptors, and these actions appear to be importantly involved in its beneficial properties not only in smoking cessation, but in depression as well. The metabolites of bupropion also act as non-competitive antagonists of these nACh receptors, and hydroxybupropion is even more potent in comparison. At therapeutically-relevant concentrations bupropion and hydroxybupropion act as negative allosteric modulators of the serotonin 5-HT3A receptor. Pharmacological data on bupropion and its metabolites are shown in the table. Bupropion is known to <b>weakly</b> inhibit the α1 adrenergic receptor, with a 14% potency of its dopamine uptake inhibition, and the H1 receptor, with a 9% potency.|$|E
5|$|Glacial {{acetic acid}} {{is used in}} {{analytical}} chemistry for the estimation of <b>weakly</b> alkaline substances such as organic amides. Glacial acetic acid is a much weaker base than water, so the amide behaves as a strong base in this medium. It then can be titrated using a solution in glacial acetic acid of a very strong acid, such as perchloric acid.|$|E
5|$|Historical {{reaction}} to the battle {{has focused on the}} significantly stronger British position in the encounter, with three large regular warships pitted against a hastily converted merchant vessel with a significant proportion of the crew suffering from illness. Duguay-Trouin was also <b>weakly</b> built and <b>weakly</b> armed: early estimates that the Duguay Trouins main battery mounted twenty-six 18-pounder long guns were revised to 12-pounders with eight smaller cannon on the upper deck. The British blockade of Isle de France continued throughout the year, with Centurion engaged in an inconclusive action against a French squadron in October. Although Isle de France remained in French hands throughout the conflict, the Indian Ocean was largely under British control by 1796.|$|E
5|$|Nobelium's {{complexing}} ability with chloride ions is most {{similar to}} that of barium, which complexes rather <b>weakly.</b> Its complexing ability with citrate, oxalate, and acetate in an aqueous solution of 0.5Mammonium nitrate is between that of calcium and strontium, although it is somewhat closer to that of strontium.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the areas}} of focus on object {{permanence}} has been how physical disabilities (blindness, cerebral palsy and deafness) and intellectual disabilities (Down syndrome, etc.) affect the development of object permanence. In a study that was performed in 1975-76, {{the results showed that}} the only area where children with intellectual disabilities performed more <b>weakly</b> than children without disabilities was along the lines of social interaction. Other tasks, such as imitation and causality tasks, were performed more <b>weakly</b> by the children without disabilities. However, object permanence was still acquired similarly because it was not related to social interaction.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} <b>weakly</b> positive {{reviews from}} critics. Reviewers praised the graphics of the game, {{as well as}} its enhancements to the original version. They were generally dismissive of the plot, even with enhancements, and disliked elements of the gameplay, especially the computer-controlled ally. Critics recommended the game mainly to fans of the genre or the series.|$|E
5|$|The {{parameters}} {{of this planet}} was initially very <b>weakly</b> constrained, with a period in excess of 8 years with a high eccentricity and a minimum mass of approximately two times the mass of Jupiter. Continued observations restrained the plausible solutions substantially, resulting in the current parameters published in 2008.|$|E
5|$|The {{synaptic}} tag hypothesis {{may also}} account for LTP's associativity and cooperativity. Associativity (see Properties) is observed when one synapse is excited with LTP-inducing stimulation while a separate synapse is only <b>weakly</b> stimulated. Whereas {{one might expect}} only the strongly stimulated synapse to undergo LTP (since weak stimulation alone is insufficient to induce LTP at either synapse), both synapses will in fact undergo LTP. While weak stimuli are unable to induce protein synthesis in the cell body, they may prompt the synthesis of a synaptic tag. Simultaneous strong stimulation of a separate pathway, capable of inducing cell body protein synthesis, then may prompt the production of plasticity-related proteins, which are shipped cell-wide. With both synapses expressing the synaptic tag, both would capture the protein products resulting in the expression of LTP in both the strongly stimulated and <b>weakly</b> stimulated pathways.|$|E
5|$|This {{exception}} arises due to competing {{horizontal and}} vertical trends in the nuclear charge. Going along a period, the nuclear charge increases with atomic number as do the number of electrons. The additional pull on outer electrons as nuclear charge increases generally outweighs the screening effect of having more electrons. With some irregularities, atoms therefore become smaller, ionization energy increases, {{and there is a}} gradual change in character, across a period, from strongly metallic, to <b>weakly</b> metallic, to <b>weakly</b> nonmetallic, to strongly nonmetallic elements. Going down a main group, the effect of increasing nuclear charge is generally outweighed by the effect of additional electrons being further away from the nucleus. Atoms generally become larger, ionization energy falls, and metallic character increases. The net effect is that the location of the metal–nonmetal transition zone shifts to the right in going down a group, and analogous diagonal similarities are seen elsewhere in the periodic table, as noted.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth {{was long}} {{considered}} the element {{with the highest}} atomic mass that is stable. However, in 2003 it was discovered to be extremely <b>weakly</b> radioactive: its only primordial isotope, bismuth-209, decays via alpha decay with a half-life {{more than a billion}} times the estimated age of the universe. Because of its tremendously long half-life, bismuth may still be considered stable for almost all purposes.|$|E
5|$|Liquid xenon {{is used in}} calorimeters {{to measure}} gamma rays, and as a {{detector}} of hypothetical <b>weakly</b> interacting massive particles, or WIMPs. When a WIMP collides with a xenon nucleus, theory predicts it will impart enough energy to cause ionization and scintillation. Liquid xenon is useful for these experiments because its density makes dark matter interaction more likely and it permits a quiet detector through self-shielding.|$|E
5|$|Metalloids usually {{look like}} metals but behave largely like nonmetals. Physically, they are shiny, brittle solids with {{intermediate}} to relatively good electrical conductivity and the electronic band {{structure of a}} semimetal or semiconductor. Chemically, they mostly behave as (weak) nonmetals, have intermediate ionization energies and electronegativity values, and amphoteric or <b>weakly</b> acidic oxides. They can form alloys with metals. Most of their other {{physical and chemical properties}} are intermediate in nature.|$|E
5|$|Multiple organolithium {{reagents}} {{are known}} {{in which there}} is a direct bond between carbon and lithium atoms, effectively creating a carbanion. These are extremely powerful bases and nucleophiles. In many of these organolithium compounds, the lithium ions tend to aggregate into high-symmetry clusters by themselves, which is relatively common for alkali cations. LiHe, a very <b>weakly</b> interacting van der Waals compound, has been detected at very low temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Ramsay {{named the}} shoe polish after the kiwi, the {{national}} bird of New Zealand; Ramsay's wife, Annie Elizabeth Meek Ramsay, {{was a native}} of Oamaru, New Zealand. It has been suggested that, at a time when several symbols were <b>weakly</b> associated with New Zealand, the eventual spread of Kiwi shoe polish around the world enhanced the Kiwi's popular appeal and promoted it {{at the expense of the}} others.|$|E
5|$|When refined, uranium is {{a silvery}} white, <b>weakly</b> {{radioactive}} metal. It has a Mohs hardness of 6, sufficient to scratch glass and approximately {{equal to that}} of titanium, rhodium, manganese and niobium. It is malleable, ductile, slightly paramagnetic, strongly electropositive and a poor electrical conductor. Uranium metal has a very high density of 19.1g/cm3, denser than lead (11.3g/cm3), but slightly less dense than tungsten and gold (19.3g/cm3).|$|E
5|$|With a {{head and}} body length of , Eliurus petteri is a {{moderately}} large species of Eliurus. Its upperparts are gray-brown to gray and contrast {{sharply with the}} white underparts. The tail tuft, a characteristic feature of Eliurus, is <b>weakly</b> developed. The skull is delicate and the incisive foramina (openings in the front part of the palate) are short and narrow. The incisors are weak.|$|E
25|$|Every {{context-free}} grammar can be effectively {{transformed into a}} <b>weakly</b> equivalent one without unreachable symbols, a <b>weakly</b> equivalent one without unproductive symbols, and a <b>weakly</b> equivalent one without cycles.|$|E
25|$|Strategy B is <b>weakly</b> {{dominated}} if {{some other}} strategy exists that <b>weakly</b> dominates B.|$|E
25|$|Strategy B is <b>weakly</b> {{dominant}} if strategy B dominates {{all other}} strategies, but some (or all) strategies are only <b>weakly</b> dominated by B.|$|E
25|$|Every {{context-free}} grammar not producing ε can be effectively {{transformed into a}} <b>weakly</b> equivalent one without ε-productions; altogether, every such grammar can be effectively transformed into a <b>weakly</b> equivalent proper CFG.|$|E
25|$|The 5×5 {{board was}} <b>weakly</b> solved for all opening moves in 2002. The 7×7 board was <b>weakly</b> solved in 2015. Humans usually {{play on a}} 19×19 board which is over 145 orders of {{magnitude}} more complex than 7×7.|$|E
25|$|If {{there exists}} a linear {{ordering}} of the cycles in a cycle basis such that each cycle includes at least one edge that {{is not part of}} any previous cycle, then the cycle basis is called <b>weakly</b> fundamental. Every fundamental cycle basis is <b>weakly</b> fundamental (for all linear orderings) but not necessarily vice versa. There exist graphs, and cycle bases for those graphs, that are not <b>weakly</b> fundamental.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, both {{strongly}} normalising {{terms and}} <b>weakly</b> normalising terms {{have a unique}} normal form. For strongly normalising terms, any reduction strategy is guaranteed to yield the normal form, whereas for <b>weakly</b> normalising terms, some reduction strategies may fail to find it.|$|E
25|$|B is <b>weakly</b> {{dominated}} by A: There {{is at least}} one set of opponents' actions for which B gives a worse outcome than A, while all other sets of opponents' actions give A the same payoff as B. (Strategy A <b>weakly</b> dominates B).|$|E
25|$|Every {{strongly}} inaccessible cardinal is also <b>weakly</b> inaccessible, {{as every}} strong limit cardinal {{is also a}} weak limit cardinal. If the generalized continuum hypothesis holds, then a cardinal is strongly inaccessible {{if and only if}} it is <b>weakly</b> inaccessible.|$|E

25|$|A {{strongly}} {{connected graph}} is a directed graph {{in which every}} ordered pair of vertices in the graph is strongly connected. Otherwise, it is called a <b>weakly</b> connected graph if every ordered pair of vertices in the graph is <b>weakly</b> connected. Otherwise it is called a disconnected graph.|$|E
