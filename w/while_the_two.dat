5|$|Christie's {{sacrifice}} {{in the film}} is a heavily criticized plot element, with critics from online publications such as Cracked.com and Bloody Disgusting calling it avoidable and unnecessary. In Keyframes: Popular Cinema and Cultural Studies, Matthew Tinkcom and Amy Villarejo write that Christie reinforces an Alien-franchise trope (shared by Parker in Alien and Dillon in Alien 3) where black characters save and sacrifice themselves for Caucasian characters. The theme of hybridization is exemplified by Christie and Vriess, according to Rizzo in Deleuze and Film: A Feminist Introduction; <b>while</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> characters are harnessed together, they alternate movement, support and combat.|$|E

Dennis Bonvie, the all-time penalty leader in professional hockey, taught him to be a better fighter <b>while</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> were teammates in Binghamton. After posting 173 PIM in 2002–03, McGrattan finished second in the AHL with 327 in 2003–04. He then set an AHL single-season record for penalties with 551 in 2004–05.|$|E
5|$|Five minutes later, the Allied ships spotted {{clouds of}} smoke {{on the horizon}} and Acton ordered the Italian ships to attack shortly {{afterwards}} <b>while</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> British cruisers turned {{to cut off the}} two Austrian destroyers.

The Austrian ships managed to disengage before the cruisers could close the distance.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert and Sullivan {{disagreed}} {{several times}} over {{the choice of a}} subject. After both Princess Ida and Ruddigore, which were less successful than the seven other operas from H.M.S. Pinafore to The Gondoliers, Sullivan asked to leave the partnership, saying that he found Gilbert's plots repetitive and that the operas were not artistically satisfying to him. <b>While</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> artists worked out their differences, Carte kept the Savoy open with revivals of their earlier works. On each occasion, after a few months' pause, Gilbert responded with a libretto that met Sullivan's objections, and the partnership was able to continue successfully.|$|E
