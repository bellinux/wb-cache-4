5|$|Gastroenteritis {{is usually}} an acute and {{self-limiting}} disease {{that does not}} require medication. The preferred treatment in those <b>with</b> <b>mild</b> to moderate dehydration is oral rehydration therapy (ORT). For children at risk of dehydration from vomiting, taking a single dose of the anti vomiting medication metoclopramide or ondansetron, may be helpful, and butylscopolamine is useful in treating abdominal pain.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{grown as}} an {{ornamental}} tree in Northern Hemisphere countries <b>with</b> <b>mild</b> maritime climates, including {{parts of the}} upper West Coast of the United States and the warmer parts of the British Isles, where its common names include Torbay palm and Torquay palm. It does not do well in hot tropical climates like Queensland, Southeast Asia and Florida.|$|E
25|$|The climate inland is temperate, with cold, damp winters and hot, dry summers, and akin to Mediterranean {{along the}} Black Sea coast, <b>with</b> <b>milder</b> winters and cooler summers.|$|R
50|$|Exercise raises body temperatures. In adults, a {{noticeable}} increase usually requires strenuous exercise or exercise sustained over a significant time. Children develop higher temperatures <b>with</b> <b>milder</b> activities, like playing.|$|R

5|$|Many {{cases of}} {{hypothyroidism}} are associated <b>with</b> <b>mild</b> elevations in creatine kinase and liver enzymes in the blood. They typically {{return to normal}} when hypothyroidism has been fully treated. Levels of cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein and lipoprotein (a) can be elevated; the impact of subclinical hypothyroidism on lipid parameters is less well-defined.|$|E
5|$|PLC {{also offers}} a unique special {{education}} unit catering to students <b>with</b> <b>mild</b> to moderate intellectual disabilities. The transition programme was developed in 1992 {{in response to a}} decision by academic staff to provide a special-needs stream. Through this unit, up to 20 girls between the ages of 11 and 18 are provided with an individual curriculum incorporating mainstream classes where possible.|$|E
5|$|And others again, whom God {{had formed}} <b>with</b> <b>mild</b> and gentle dispositions, think it {{necessary}} to put a force upon their own tempers, by acting a noisy, violent, malicious part, {{as a means to}} be distinguished. Thus hath party got the better of the very genius and constitution of our people; so that whoever reads the character of the English in former ages, will hardly believe their present posterity to be of the same nation or climate.|$|E
50|$|A common mushroom, Hebeloma crustuliniforme can {{be found}} in open {{woodland}} and heathland in summer and autumn, though may extend through winter in places <b>with</b> <b>milder</b> winters such as California.|$|R
50|$|The life {{expectancy}} in alpha-mannosidosis is highly variable. Individuals with early onset severe disease {{often do not}} survive beyond childhood, whereas those <b>with</b> <b>milder</b> disorders may survive well into adult life.|$|R
50|$|The {{symptoms}} include {{many of the}} symptoms associated <b>with</b> <b>milder</b> degrees of hypoglycemia, especially the adrenergic symptoms, but do not progress to objective impairment of brain function, seizures, coma, or brain damage.|$|R
5|$|As a character, Scar has {{garnered}} widespread acclaim from film critics, who greeted Irons' {{performance with}} equal enthusiasm. However, Scar's violence, dark color palette and allegedly effeminate mannerisms were initially met <b>with</b> <b>mild</b> controversy, perceived {{by some as}} racist and homophobic. Nevertheless, Scar continues to be revered as one of Disney's greatest villains by various media publications, topping The Huffington Posts list and ranking within the top ten of similar lists published by Yahoo! Movies, the Orlando Sentinel, E! and CNN. Scar has also been ranked among the greatest villains in film history by Digital Spy and Entertainment Weekly.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} the disease include not having sex or having few sexual {{partners}} and using condoms. Screening women at risk for chlamydial infection followed by treatment decreases the risk of PID. If the diagnosis is suspected, treatment is typically advised. Treating a woman's sexual partners should also occur. In those <b>with</b> <b>mild</b> or moderate symptoms a single injection of the antibiotic ceftriaxone along with two weeks of doxycycline and possibly metronidazole by mouth is recommended. For {{those who do not}} improve after three days or who have severe disease intravenous antibiotics should be used.|$|E
5|$|Measurement of {{predictive}} visual tracking {{is being}} studied as a screening technique to identify mild traumatic brain injury. A head-mounted display unit with eye-tracking capability shows a moving object in a predictive pattern {{for the person}} to follow with their eyes. People without brain injury {{will be able to}} track the moving object with smooth pursuit eye movements and correct trajectory while it is hypothesized that those <b>with</b> <b>mild</b> traumatic brain injury cannot.|$|E

40|$|Sensibility {{threshold}} {{was measured}} in patients with depressive and nondepressive psychiatric disorders, where both groups were suffering from chronic orofacial pain. The control patients had no pain and no signs of mental disturbance. Patients with major depressive disorders had a significantly lower sensibility threshold than patients <b>with</b> <b>milder</b> depressive disorders, while patients <b>with</b> <b>milder</b> depressive disorders had a significantly lower sensibility threshold than patients with nondepressive mental disorders. The controls had the highest sensibility threshold. Plasma, β-endorphin, cortisol and prolactin levels were also measured. The depressed patients {{were found to have}} a lower serum β-endorphin level than the nondepressive patients and the controls, although the difference was not statistically significant...|$|R
50|$|Cortinarius splendens, {{commonly}} known as the splendid webcap, is a basidiomycete mushroom of the genus Cortinarius native to Europe. It has been implicated in poisonings resulting in renal failure, though <b>with</b> <b>milder</b> symptoms than other deadly webcaps.|$|R
5|$|Patients with {{abortive}} polio infections recover completely. In {{those who}} develop only aseptic meningitis, the symptoms {{can be expected}} to persist for two to ten days, followed by complete recovery. In cases of spinal polio, if the affected nerve cells are completely destroyed, paralysis will be permanent; cells that are not destroyed, but lose function temporarily, may recover within four to six weeks after onset. Half the patients with spinal polio recover fully; one-quarter recover <b>with</b> <b>mild</b> disability, and the remaining quarter are left with severe disability. The degree of both acute paralysis and residual paralysis is likely to be proportional to the degree of viremia, and inversely proportional to the degree of immunity. Spinal polio is rarely fatal.|$|E
5|$|Proactiv {{is aimed}} at {{customers}} <b>with</b> <b>mild</b> to moderate acne. According to a 2011 review, {{there have been few}} studies examining its efficacy. A 2007 study saw inflammatory lesions reduced by 39 percent in subjects using a combination of butenafine and benzoyl peroxide, compared with 34 percent in those using Proactiv containing only benzoyl peroxide. A physician suggested in Salon that its three-step system might make it easier for teenagers to comply, but that the key to its success lay with its celebrity endorsements.|$|E
5|$|Qidra is a rice dish {{named after}} the clay vessel and oven it is baked in. Rice is cooked with pieces of meat inside of the vessel, often using lamb, whole garlic cloves, {{garbanzo}} beans, cardamom pods, and various other spices such as, turmeric, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg and cumin. Plain rice cooked in meat or chicken broth and flavored <b>with</b> <b>mild</b> spices including cinnamon is known as fatteh ghazzawiyyeh. The rice is layered over a thin markook bread known as farasheeh, smothered in ghee and topped with stuffed chicken or lamb. The meal is eaten with green peppers and lemon sauce.|$|E

50|$|Its {{position}} on the south coast gives it a climate <b>with</b> <b>milder</b> winters than inland areas and less rainfall than locations further west. This helped establish the town as a popular health and leisure resort during the late Victorian and early Edwardian eras.|$|R
5000|$|These {{descriptions}} {{refer to}} 'classic' Alport Syndrome, which usually causes significant disease from young adult or late childhood life.

5|$|Somerset {{had been}} granted {{first-class}} status {{in advance of the}} 1882 season. Their maiden season at the top level was described by Wisden as disastrous, but the publication qualified this statement <b>with</b> <b>mild</b> optimism for 1883. The county {{failed to live up to}} this optimism, and although there were a few wins, performances on the whole were poor. Twice between 1882 and 1884 Somerset's opponents scored over 500 runs in an innings against them, and against Lancashire in 1884 they fielded only ten players. Stephen Newton, who had captained the side since 1882, left the club at the end of the 1884 season, and thereafter played all his cricket in London.|$|E
5|$|The annual {{incidence}} is about 1.1 per 100,000 annually in population studies from the United States and France. From 1994 to 2003, the incidence increased threefold; {{this has been}} attributed to the more widespread use of modern imaging modalities rather than a true increase. Similarly, those living in urban areas are more likely to receive appropriate investigations, accounting for increased rates of diagnosis in those dwelling in cities. It is suspected that a proportion of cases in people <b>with</b> <b>mild</b> symptoms remains undiagnosed.|$|E
5|$|The wind enables this moderating effect. The {{windward}} {{side of a}} land mass experiences more moderation than the leeward side. In the Northern Hemisphere, the prevailing wind is west-to-east, and western coasts tend to be milder than eastern coasts. This is seen in Eastern North America and Western Europe, where rough continental climates appear {{on the east coast}} on parallels <b>with</b> <b>mild</b> climates {{on the other side of}} the ocean. In the Southern Hemisphere, the prevailing wind is east-to-west, and the eastern coasts are milder.|$|E
50|$|Chã {{does have}} a lot of {{vegetation}} (albeit not in the lava fields), which grows in the rich volcanic soils adjacent to the crater rim. Because of its altitude (elevation 1,629 m), Chã is blessed <b>with</b> <b>milder</b> temperatures and greater precipitation than surrounding areas.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of these serious {{skeletal}} problems, many infants with platyspondylic lethal skeletal dysplasia, Torrance type are born prematurely, are stillborn, or die shortly after birth from respiratory failure. A few affected people <b>with</b> <b>milder</b> signs and symptoms have lived into adulthood, however.|$|R
50|$|Katha has a {{tropical}} savanna climate (Köppen climate classification Aw) bordering on a humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cwa). Temperatures are very warm to hot throughout the year, <b>with</b> <b>milder</b> winter months (December-February). There is a winter dry season (November-March) and a summer wet season (April-October).|$|R
5|$|Warfarin also {{interacts with}} many herbs and spices, some used in food (such as ginger and garlic) and others used purely for {{medicinal}} purposes (such as ginseng and Ginkgo biloba). All may increase bleeding and bruising in people taking warfarin; similar effects {{have been reported}} with borage (starflower) oil or fish oils. St. John's Wort, sometimes recommended to help <b>with</b> <b>mild</b> to moderate depression, reduces {{the effectiveness of a}} given dose of warfarin; it induces the enzymes that break down warfarin in the body, causing a reduced anticoagulant effect.|$|E
5|$|July 1986 was {{an unusually}} active month for {{moderate}} to strong earthquakes in California, with three events occurring {{in less than}} two weeks, each <b>with</b> <b>mild</b> to moderate effects. The first of these shocks came on July 8 with a M6.0 event on the Banning fault near Palm Springs and the second event occurred off the coast of Oceanside as a M5.8 shock on July 13. While the earthquake off the southern California coast occurred in an area thought to be capable of generating a tsunami, the earthquake near Palm Springs occurred on a portion of the southern San Andreas Fault system that has been designated a seismic gap, and is a likely location for a very large earthquake. The same seismic gap theory (regarding the potential for a future large earthquake) had also been presented for the White Mountains area near Chalfant.|$|E
5|$|Northern {{parts of}} the country are {{characterized}} by hot, humid summers <b>with</b> <b>mild,</b> drier winters, and highly seasonal precipitation. Mesopotamia, located in northeast Argentina, has a subtropical climate with no dry season and is characterized by high temperatures and abundant rainfall because of exposure to moist easterly winds from the Atlantic Ocean throughout the year. The Chaco region in the center-north, despite being relatively homogeneous in terms of precipitation and temperature, is the warmest region in Argentina, {{and one of the few}} natural areas in the world located between tropical and temperate latitudes that is not a desert. Precipitation decreases from east to west in the Chaco region because eastern areas are more influenced by moist air from the Atlantic Ocean than the west, resulting in the vegetation transitioning from forests and marshes to shrubs. Northwest Argentina is predominantly dry, hot, and subtropical although its rugged topography results in a diverse climate.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} method for {{alkylation}} of the lactam nitrogen of 2,5-diketopiperazines {{is based on}} the use of sodium hydride as base. However epimerisation can occur especially with proline-fused 2,5-diketopiperazines, even <b>with</b> <b>milder</b> methods such as under phase-transfer catalyst conditions for example 1 to 2.|$|R
50|$|While {{the general}} {{prognosis}} is favorable, current {{studies indicate that}} West Nile Fever can often be more severe than previously recognized, with studies of various recent outbreaks indicating that it may {{take as long as}} 60-90 days to recover. People <b>with</b> <b>milder</b> WNF are just as likely as those with more severe manifestations of neuroinvasive disease to experience multiple long term (>1+ years) somatic complaints such as tremor, and dysfunction in motor skills and executive functions. People <b>with</b> <b>milder</b> illness are just as likely as people with more severe illness to experience adverse outcomes. Recovery is marked by a long convalescence with fatigue. One study found that neuroinvasive WNV infection was associated with an increased risk for subsequent kidney disease.|$|R
50|$|The {{floodplain}} area: The floodplains, <b>with</b> <b>milder</b> slopes, {{are located}} at {{the middle of the}} basin. This zone receive sediments that is moderately finer and considerably lower in volume. Backswamps along this section fill and drain several times in each monsoon, helping to reduce flood peak downstream.|$|R
