5|$|Another fountain, {{sometimes}} {{also known}} as the Wignacourt Fountain, was built close to Porta Reale in Valletta attached to the Ferreria building (demolished). It consists of a lion's head pouring out <b>water</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> stone basin, topped by the coat of arms of Wignacourt and the Order and surrounded by a garland of flowers and interlocking seashells. Below the coats of arms is a radiating sun with the inscription Omnibus Idem (meaning the same to all), indicating that the water was freely available to everyone.|$|E
5|$|On Berrow Road, {{near the}} High Lighthouse, numbers 4, 6 and 8 {{were part of}} a terrace built between 1838 and 1841. Number 31 was {{previously}} a lodge. On the corner of Berrow Road and Sea View is a drinking fountain from 1897 with a single dressed stone pier and moulded plinth, topped by a cast iron urn. Each side has the lions head design with those on the north and south sides giving <b>water</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> Purbeck Marble bowl.|$|E
5|$|Radyr Weir {{was built}} in 1774 to divert <b>water</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> leat to the Melingriffith Tin Plate Works. The weir is the third {{obstacle}} to migratory salmon and sea trout — the others being Llandaff Weir and Blackweir, both of which also have fish passes. Since the early 1980s, the salmon and sea trout stocks in the Taff have been recovering from nearly 200 years of industrial pollution and exploitation. In 1993 the National Rivers Authority monitored over 500 salmon and 700 sea trout returning to the river to spawn.|$|E

5|$|Bart {{attempts}} to reinspire Krusty by showing him old episodes of the show, but {{he picks up}} on the repetitive nature of his own jokes, and binge drinks in anger. He passes out and has a vision of himself in Jewish Heaven, where he meets Rodney Dangerfield. Rabbi Krustofski then appears and tells Krusty that Jews {{do not believe in}} Heaven, and thus he should do more to help others. An act of kindness does not seem to make him happier, but Bart takes Krusty to the synagogue, where Rabbi Krustofski's favorite Rabbi recites Krusty's jokes on religion. Krusty therefore deduces that his father did find him funny, and sees him again in Jewish Heaven, where Jesus turns Dangerfield's <b>water</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> Bloody Mary.|$|E

25|$|The {{cause of}} the {{disaster}} remains under debate. The Indian government and local activists argue that slack management and deferred maintenance created a situation where routine pipe maintenance caused a backflow of <b>water</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> MIC tank, triggering the disaster.

25|$|Cedar Creek Reservoir {{was built}} on Cedar Creek, a {{tributary}} to the Trinity River. The dam is {{at the south end}} of the lake in the town of Malakoff.

These idents consisted of live action scenes often involving the number 3 such as three drops of <b>water</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> river. The 3 logo now moved from just the stylized 3 into three circles with the stylized 3 in the last circle. The presentation package was produced by Cleverality.|$|E
25|$|The House of the Antae {{was built}} in the style of Greek houses around the Mediterranean. A two storey house with three wings and a portico of Tuscan columns, built around a small basin of water, fed by {{rainwater}} from the roof, which channelled the <b>water</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> cistern, then into the drains which ran under the pavement of the street. It is named after two fluted antae that flank its doorway.|$|E

50|$|Extraction in {{chemistry}} is a separation process consisting in {{the separation of}} a substance from a matrix. It includes Liquid-liquid extraction, and Solid phase extraction. The distribution of a solute between two phases is an equilibrium condition described by partition theory.

25|$|The {{earliest}} {{mention of}} the existence of Manneken Pis can be found in an administrative text, dating from 1451–1452, about the water lines supplying the fountains of Brussels. From the beginning, the fountain played an essential role in the distribution of drinking water. It stood on a column and poured <b>water</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> double rectangular basin of stone. The only representations of this first statue can be found, very schematically, in a painting by Denis Van Alsloot, representing the Brussels' Ommegang of 1615 and in a preparatory drawing to this painting.|$|E
25|$|Separate paste mixing {{has shown}} that the mixing of cement and <b>water</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> paste before {{combining}} these materials with aggregates can increase the compressive strength of the resulting concrete. The paste is generally mixed in a high-speed, shear-type mixer at a w/cm (water to cement ratio) of 0.30 to 0.45 by mass. The cement paste premix may include admixtures such as accelerators or retarders, superplasticizers, pigments, or silica fume. The premixed paste is then blended with aggregates and any remaining batch water and final mixing is completed in conventional concrete mixing equipment.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} this is that human {{activities}} are adding CO2 to the atmosphere faster than natural processes can remove it (see carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere for a complete explanation). This is analogous to a flow of <b>water</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> bathtub. So long as the tap runs water (analogous to the emission of carbon dioxide) into the tub faster than water escapes through the plughole (the natural removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere), then the level of water in the tub (analogous to the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere) will continue to rise.|$|E
