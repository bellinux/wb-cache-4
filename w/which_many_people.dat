5|$|Beauty {{in nature}} has {{historically}} been a prevalent theme in art and books, filling large sections of libraries and bookstores. That nature has been depicted and celebrated by so much art, photography, poetry, and other literature shows the strength with <b>which</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> associate nature and beauty. Reasons why this association exists, and what the association consists of, are studied by the branch of philosophy called aesthetics. Beyond certain basic characteristics that many philosophers agree about to explain what is seen as beautiful, the opinions are virtually endless. Nature and wildness have been important subjects in various eras of world history. An early tradition of landscape art began in China during the Tang Dynasty (618–907). The tradition of representing nature as it is {{became one of the}} aims of Chinese painting and was a significant influence in Asian art.|$|E

25|$|The New Liberalism {{or social}} {{liberalism}} movement emerged about 1900 in Britain. The New Liberals, which included intellectuals like L.T. Hobhouse, and John A.

They were first brought to Louisiana {{in the early}} 1930s for the fur industry, and the population was kept in check, or at a small population size, because of trapping pressure from the fur traders. The earliest account of nutria spreading freely into Louisiana wetlands from their enclosures {{was in the early}} 1940s; a hurricane hit the Louisiana coast for <b>which</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> were unprepared, and the storm destroyed the enclosures, enabling the nutria to escape into the wild.

25|$|Following his exile as {{a result}} of his actions in support of absolutism in the April Revolt (Abrilada), Miguel {{returned}} to Portugal as regent and fiancé of his niece Queen Maria II. As regent, he claimed the Portuguese throne in his own right, since according to the so-called Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom his older brother Pedro IV and therefore the latter's daughter had lost their rights from the moment that Pedro had made war on Portugal and become the sovereign of a foreign state (Brazilian Empire). This led to a difficult political situation, during <b>which</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> were killed, imprisoned, persecuted or sent into exile, and which culminated in the Portuguese Liberal Wars between authoritarian absolutists and progressive constitutionalists. In the end Miguel was forced from the throne and lived the last 32 years of his life in exile.|$|E
500|$|Banathy {{introduced}} {{a unique and}} never-before used approach to organizing the International Systems Institute conferences. Banathy observed that in traditional conferences, a few usually well-respected or prestigious individuals would apply to present [...] "pre-packaged new ideas" [...] to others. In typical conferences, presenting almost always carries more prestige than listening; the few presenters share their wisdom with the many. This one-to-many or [...] "hierarchical knowledge distribution system" [...] slowed the sharing and spreading of ideas about <b>which</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> cared deeply if not passionately, as there was always limited opportunity for interchange among participants. This interaction was usually wedged into the interstices of the formal schedule {{in the form of}} informal, spontaneous gatherings for which no record existed.|$|E
