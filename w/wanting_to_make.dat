5|$|A Southern hip hop record, Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik {{features}} live instrumentation in its hip hop {{production and}} musical elements from funk and soul genres. <b>Wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{a statement about}} urban life as an African American in the South, OutKast wrote and recorded the album as teenagers and addressed coming of age topics with the album's songs. They also incorporated repetitive hooks and Southern slang in their lyrics.|$|E
5|$|Designed by Steve Brown and Richard Leinfellner, Cauldron {{originated}} as {{a licensed}} video {{game of the}} horror film Halloween. Brown eventually altered the game to use a theme based on the Halloween holiday. The mix of two genres resulted from Brown and Leinfellner <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a shoot 'em up and platform game, respectively. The developers realized {{that there were no}} technical limitations preventing the genres from being combined.|$|E
5|$|Kusama {{wrote the}} {{screenplay}} for Girlfight after learning to box, <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{a film about}} the sport with a female protagonist. Although she struggled to find financiers for the film's $1 million (U.S.) budget, the production was eventually funded by John Sayles, Maggie Renzi and the Independent Film Channel. Rodriguez was cast in the lead role, despite having never acted before, and trained for four months {{to prepare for the}} role before filming commenced in New York and New Jersey.|$|E

5|$|The film {{announced}} in November 2009. It {{was directed by}} Hanung Bramantyo, a Yogyakarta-born Muslim filmmaker. Bramantyo, who had previously directed the Islamic-themed Ayat-Ayat Cinta (The Verses of Love; 2008), considered Dahlan his favourite national hero; he later told The Jakarta Post that he admired the kyai's spirit. He {{also said that he}} had been <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the film since he was a teenager. The film was meant to coincide with the 100 year anniversary of Muhammadiyah's founding.|$|E

Anand approached novelist Advaita Kala who developed the story into a feature-length script, and later co-wrote the screenplay with him. Principal photography was done entirely in New York City, Las Vegas and San Francisco.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{cancellation}} of the 2004–05 NHL season by the NHL lockout, Brashear signed with the Quebec Radio X of the semi-pro Ligue Nord-Américaine de Hockey league (LNAH). The deal was reportedly worth $300,000. He registered 18 goals and 50 points in 47 games, but was reluctant to fight and felt the League did little {{to protect him from}} players <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a name for themselves against an established NHL enforcer. Brashear was suspended from the League following an incident where he continued punching a player in the face while he was lying on the ice.|$|E

5|$|Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney was {{developed}} {{by a team of}} seven people, and took ten months to make. It was directed by Shu Takumi and produced by Atsushi Inaba, with music by Masakazu Sugimori, character design by Kumiko Suekane, and art by Tatsuro Iwamoto. In 2000, after Takumi had finished his work on Dino Crisis 2, his boss at the time, Shinji Mikami, gave him six months to create any type of game he wanted to. Takumi had originally joined Capcom <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> mystery and adventure games, and felt that this was a big chance for him to make a mark as a creator.|$|E
5|$|The festival {{turned out}} to be a huge success, both {{critically}} and financially. The show attracted the attention of entertainment executives, including Columbia Pictures, which met with Laliberté and Gauthier under the pretense of <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a movie about Cirque du Soleil. Laliberté was unhappy with the deal, claiming that it gave too many rights to Columbia, which was attempting to secure all rights to the production. Laliberté pulled out of the deal before it could be concluded, and that experience stands out as a key reason why Cirque du Soleil remained independent and privately owned for 28 years, until Guy Laliberte announced in April 2015 that he was selling his majority stake to a group headed by a U.S. private equity firm, and its Chinese partners.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} created by Shu Takumi, who wrote and {{directed}} the first three games. The first game was conceived in 2000 when Takumi's boss at the time, Shinji Mikami, gave him six months to create any type of game he wanted to; Takumi had originally joined Capcom <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> mystery and adventure games, and {{felt that this was}} a big chance for him to make a mark as a creator. The game was designed to be simple, as Takumi wanted it to be easy enough for even his mother to play. It was originally going to be a detective game, with Phoenix being a private investigator, but at one point Takumi realized that finding and taking apart contradictions was not related to detective work, and felt that the main setting of the game should be courtrooms.|$|E

5|$|<b>Wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> maximum {{use of the}} government's {{financial}} backing, {{which was}} only available for a limited period, Pick {{did not have time}} to press the Underground's case for these extensions. Instead he developed a plan for an extension of the C south-west from Clapham Common to Sutton in Surrey. Pick still faced strong opposition from the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway and the London and South Western Railway which operated in the area, but the Underground had the advantage of already having an approval for the last few miles of the route as part of an unused pre-war permission for a new line from Wimbledon to Sutton. The railway companies challenged the need for a new service, claiming it would simply drain passengers from their own trains and that any extension should only run as far as Tooting, but Pick was able to counter their arguments and negotiated a compromise settlement to extend the C as far as Morden.|$|E
