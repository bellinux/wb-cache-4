Its construction by the student aims to help them focus on the expectations of their readers. A writer model is inferred from answers to brief questions about the student, and holds information about writing strategies. This enables advice to be tailored to the student's preferred approaches to writing. A student model is inferred from on-line help pages viewed by the writer, and from information given by them. This enables additional information to be consulted. The models are designed to improve the performance of on-line <b>writing</b> <b>environments</b> by serving appropriate, individualised advice, as needed. ...|$|R

The system was integrated with multilayer educational services platforms, which are designed to support the establishment of online social learning communities for K- 12 students and teachers.

Often this new technology is commercially produced or open source, free, incredibly intuitive to use, and most important, created {{for the express purpose of}} facilitating collaborative writing. It is important to understand if these new technologies, commonly referred to as collaborative writing environments, offer a common-sense, low-to-no-cost means for institutions of higher learning to address the challenge of teaching collaborative writing skills to students. This qualitative research study analyzed one of these new tools, Google Documents, to determine its suitability as a collaborative <b>writing</b> <b>environment</b> for students. Google Documents was the object of inquiry because of its recent adoption campus-wide for all students to use at Iowa State. A dual approach to investigate Google Documents was conducted to determine its suitability as a collaborative <b>writing</b> <b>environment</b> for students. A set of criteria, which I coined The Essential Collaborative Writing Toolkit, for evaluating collaborative writing environments was drawn from the research literature. I was then able to measure Google Documents against these criteria in order to see if it adequately met the specifications needed for a successful collaborative <b>writing</b> <b>environment.</b> Students were also interviewed to discover their experiences using Google Documents. A transcript analysis of these interviews was then made. My findings suggest that Google Documents, with little exception, is an appropriate collaborative <b>writing</b> <b>environment</b> for students.
