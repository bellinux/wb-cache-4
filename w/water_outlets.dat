50|$|Another common {{reason for}} failure of flat roofs {{is lack of}} drain {{maintenance}} where gravel, leaves and debris block <b>water</b> <b>outlets</b> (be they spigots, drains, downpipes or gutters). This causes a pressure head of water (the deeper the water, the greater the pressure) which can force more water into the smallest hole or crack. In colder climates, puddling water can freeze, breaking up the roof surface as the ice expands. It is therefore important to maintain your flat roof to avoid excessive repair.|$|E

The dado is set beneath a modest entablature and the pediment is flanked by sandstone urns at each corner.|$|E

50|$|Each {{of these}} {{plumbing}} fixtures has {{one or more}} <b>water</b> <b>outlets</b> and a drain. In some cases, the drain has a device that can be manipulated to block the drain to fill the basin of the fixture. Each fixture also has a flood rim, or level at which water will begin to overflow. Most fixtures also have an overflow, which is a conduit for water to drain away, when the regular drain is plugged, before the water actually overflows at the flood rim level. However, water closets and showers (that are not in bathtubs) usually lack this feature because their drains normally cannot be stopped.|$|E
5000|$|Operation {{with low}} supply {{pressure}}: Tankless systems are reliant {{on the water}} pressure that is delivered to the property. In other words, if a tankless system is used to deliver water to a shower or water faucet, the pressure {{is the same as}} the pressure delivered to the property and cannot be increased, whereas in tanked systems the tanks can be positioned above the <b>water</b> <b>outlets</b> (in the loft/attic space for example) so the force of gravity can assist in delivering the water, and pumps can be added into the system to increase pressure. Power showers, for example, cannot be used with tankless systems because the tankless systems cannot deliver the hot water at a fast enough flow rate required by the pump.|$|E
