5|$|There is {{relatively}} little published on {{or in the}} Nafaanra language. The first linguistic publication to mention Nafaanra is Delafosse (1904), containing some notes on the Nafana people and a fairly extensive comparative Senufo <b>word</b> <b>list,</b> though it lacked any proper tonal marking. Rapp (1933) is an appendix to {{an article on the}} Kulango language containing a German-Nafaanra (Nafana-Sprache) <b>word</b> <b>list</b> of around 100 items, gathered during a stay of four hours at Sampa. Rapp notes in passing that special attention was paid to the marking of the tones.|$|E
5|$|Senufo {{languages}} have {{a typical}} Niger–Congo noun class (or gender) system. Suffixes on nouns mark membership {{of one of}} the five noun genders. Pronouns, adjectives and copulas reflect the noun gender of the nominal they refer to. Although none of the sources on Nafaanra provides any details, it can be inferred from a brief <b>word</b> <b>list</b> given by Jordan that the Nafaanra noun class system resembles that of other Senufo languages.|$|E

50|$|The first ethnologists to {{work with}} the Bongo {{language}} were John Petherick, who published Bongo <b>word</b> <b>lists</b> in his 1861 work, Egypt, the Soudan, and Central Africa; Theodor von Heuglin, who also published Bongo <b>word</b> <b>lists</b> in Reise in das Gebiet des Weissen Nil, &c. 1862-1864 in 1869; and Georg August Schweinfurth, who contributed sentences and vocabularies in his Linguistische Ergebnisse, Einer Reise Nach Centralafrika in 1873. E. E. Evans-Pritchard published additional Bongo <b>word</b> <b>lists</b> in 1937.|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies have}} found that {{children}} with callous-unemotional (CU) traits have a deficit in processing emotionally negative material. The present study examined whether this deficit also affects emotional memory. Twenty-two children with low CU traits and 24 children with high CU traits between 8 and 12 years of age were selected from a community sample and presented with neutral and negative emotional words, using the DeeseRoedigerMcDermott paradigm. On true recall, {{there was no difference between}} the groups. Both groups had higher true recall rates for the neutral <b>word</b> <b>lists</b> than for the negative lists. However, on false recall, although there were no group differences for neutral <b>word</b> <b>lists,</b> the high CU group recalled significantly fewer critical lures on the negative <b>word</b> <b>lists</b> than the low CU group. Furthermore, the high CU group had significantly less false recall on the negative <b>word</b> <b>lists</b> compared to the neutral <b>word</b> <b>lists,</b> while the low CU group showed no difference in false recall between the <b>word</b> <b>lists.</b> These results indicate that children with high CU traits have no deficiencies in true memory performance, yet are less susceptible to developing false memories concerning emotionally negative material...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe present {{experiment}} hypothesized that: a) {{the conflict}} of schemas would be greater (means that recall would be decreased) as the participant activated together (through reading and listening) <b>word</b> <b>lists</b> from two different schemas, than when they activated <b>word</b> <b>lists</b> from only one schema, and b) that participant would show greater reconstruction phenomenon in the recall face when activated together (through reading and listening) <b>word</b> <b>lists</b> from two different schemas than when they activated <b>word</b> <b>lists</b> from one schema. In the present experiment 36 undergraduate students from the American College of Greece were randomly selected to participate. Their participation was voluntary. One third (n= 12) read and listened school schema simultaneously, one third (n= 12) read and listened super market schema simultaneously and one third (n= 12) read school schema and listened super market schema simultaneously. Results showed that {{the conflict of}} schemas would be greater as the participant activated together <b>word</b> <b>lists</b> from two different schemas. In addition, opposing to {{the second part of}} original hypothesis, the participants wouldn’t show greater reconstruction phenomenon in the recall face when activated together <b>word</b> <b>lists</b> from two different schemas...|$|R
25|$|During the 1950s the Czech {{poet and}} former Esperantist Ladislav Podmele (1920–2000), also known under his {{pseudonym}} Jiří Karen, worked {{for several years}} {{with a team of}} prominent interlinguists on an elaborate project, Mežduslavjanski jezik ("Interslavic language"). Among other things, they wrote a grammar, an Esperanto–Interslavic <b>word</b> <b>list,</b> a dictionary, a course and a textbook. Although none of those were ever published, the project gained some attention of linguists from various countries. Probably due to the political reality of those days, this language was primarily based on Russian.|$|E
25|$|The North-West Yoruba dialects {{show more}} {{linguistic}} innovation than the Southeast and Central dialects. This, {{combined with the}} fact that the latter areas generally have older settlements, suggests a later date for migration into Northwestern Yorubaland. According to the Kay Williamson Scale, the following is the degree of relationship between Itsekiri and other Yoruboid dialects, using a compiled <b>word</b> <b>list</b> of the most common words. A similarity of 100% would mean a total overlap of two dialects, while a similarity of 0 would mean two speech areas that have absolutely no relationship.|$|E

40|$|SWITCH- Swedish Intelligibility {{test for}} children, {{is a test}} that {{measures}} intelligibility of children's speech through repetition of single words. The test is computer generated and consists of 1000 <b>word</b> <b>lists</b> randomly selected for each assessment. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the equivalence, reliability and validity in the <b>word</b> <b>lists.</b> <b>Word</b> <b>lists</b> were tested on ten children with typical language development (N group) and ten children with speech deviation (T group). The children were audio recorded when they repeated two lists. Twenty speech therapy students assessed the intelligibility. Percentage of consonants correct (PCC) were calculated. The results of each child´s two <b>word</b> <b>lists</b> were compared to calculate the equivalence. Inter- and intraraterreliability were examined. Validity was examined by examining correlations between PCC and intelligibility, and by comparing the intelligibility of the N-group and Tgroup. The results showed that the <b>word</b> <b>lists</b> in SWITCH were equivalent and that the method was reliable and valid...|$|R

40|$|<b>Word</b> <b>lists</b> {{have become}} {{available}} {{for most of}} the world’s languages, but {{only a small fraction of}} such lists contain cognate information. We present a machine-learning approach that automatically clusters words in multilingual <b>word</b> <b>lists</b> into cognate sets. Our method incorporates a number of diverse word similarity measures and features that encode the degree of affinity between pairs of languages. The output of the classification algorithm is then used to generate cognate groups. The results of the experiments on <b>word</b> <b>lists</b> representing several language families demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach. ...|$|R
500|$|Maurice Delafosse was {{the first}} {{linguist}} to mention Nafaanra, calling it [...] "a much dispersed Senufo tribe" [...] in 1904. Westermann in his classification of West-African languages, also grouped Nafaanra with Senufo, apparently based on the <b>word</b> <b>list</b> found in Rapp. This classification is confirmed by Bendor-Samuel, who bases his internal Senufo classification on the comparative word lists in Swadesh et al.|$|E
500|$|Geisel gave varying {{accounts}} {{of how he}} conceived of The Cat in the Hat. According to the story Geisel told most often, he was so frustrated with the <b>word</b> <b>list</b> that William Spaulding had given him that he finally decided to scan the list and create a story {{out of the first}} two words he found that rhymed. The words he found were cat and hat.|$|E
500|$|Geisel gave two conflicting, partly fictionalized {{accounts}} of the book's creation in two articles, [...] "How Orlo Got His Book" [...] in The New York Times Book Review and [...] "My Hassle with the First Grade Language" [...] in the Chicago Tribune, both published on November 17, 1957. In [...] "My Hassle with the First Grade Language", he wrote about his proposal to a [...] "distinguished schoolbook publisher" [...] {{to write a book}} for young children about [...] "scaling the peaks of Everest at 60 degrees below". The publisher was intrigued but informed him that, because of the <b>word</b> <b>list,</b> [...] "you can't use the word scaling. You can't use the word peaks. You can't use Everest. You can't use 60. You can't use degrees. You can't..." [...] Geisel gave a similar account to Robert Cahn for an article in the July 6, 1957, edition of The Saturday Evening Post. In [...] "My Hassle With the First Grade Language", he also told a story of the [...] "three excruciatingly painful weeks" [...] in which he worked on a story about a King Cat and a Queen Cat. However, [...] "queen" [...] was not on the <b>word</b> <b>list,</b> nor did his first grade nephew, Norval, recognize it. So Geisel returned to the work but could then think only of words that started with the letter [...] "q", which did not appear in any word on the list. He then had a similar fascination with the letter [...] "z", which also did not appear in any word on the list. When he did finally finish the book and showed it to his nephew, Norval had already graduated from the first grade and was learning calculus. Philip Nel notes, in his dissection of the article, that Norval was Geisel's invention. Geisel's niece, Peggy Owens, did have a son, but he was only a one-year-old when the article was published.|$|E

50|$|While <b>word</b> <b>lists</b> {{used were}} {{originally}} {{based on the}} 100-item Swadesh list, it was statistically determined that a subset of 40 of the 100 items produced just as good if not slightly better classificatory results than the whole <b>list.</b> So subsequently <b>word</b> <b>lists</b> gathered contain only 40 items (or less, when attestations for some are lacking).|$|R
500|$|Little {{more was}} done {{until the late}} 20th century. In 1986 Federico Krutwig {{published}} a short article in the Revista Internacional de Estudios Vascos entitled [...] "Los gitanos vascos", with a short <b>word</b> <b>list</b> and a brief analysis of the language's morphology. However, the most detailed research to date {{was carried out by}} Basque philologist Josune Muñoz and historian Elias Lopez de Mungia, who began their work in the Southern Basque Country in 1996 {{at the behest of the}} Romani organisation Kalé Dor Kayiko, with support from the Euskaltzaindia and the University of the Basque Country. Kalé Dor Kayiko, who had been working to promote the Romani language, was alerted to the existence of Erromintxela in the 1990s through an article by the historian Alizia Stürtze, Agotak, juduak eta ijitoak Euskal Herrian [...] "Agotes, Jews, and Gypsies in the Basque Country". Kalé Dor Kayiko intends to continue research into the language, attitudes, identity, and history of the Erromintxela people in the less well researched provinces of Navarre and the Northern Basque Country.|$|E
500|$|Geisel gave varying {{accounts}} {{of how he}} created The Cat in the Hat, but in the version he told most often he was so frustrated with the <b>word</b> <b>list</b> from which he could choose words to write his story {{that he decided to}} scan the list and create a story based on the first two words he found that rhymed. The words he found were cat and hat. The book met with immediate critical acclaim and financial success. Reviewers praised it as an exciting alternative to traditional primers. Three years after its debut, the book had already sold over a million copies, and in 2001 Publishers Weekly listed the book at number nine on its list of best-selling children's books of all time. The book's success {{led to the creation of}} Beginner Books, a publishing house centered on producing similar books for young children learning to read. In 1983, Geisel said, [...] "It is the book I'm proudest of because it had something to do with the death of the Dick and Jane primers." [...] The book was adapted into a 1971 animated television special and [...] a 2003 live-action film.|$|E
500|$|After {{a period}} of silence on Nafaanra, Painter (1966) appeared, {{consisting}} of basic word lists of the Pantera and Fantera dialects. The SIL linguist Dean Jordan published an article on Nafaanra discourse in 1978, and together with his wife Carol Jordan has produced a translation of the New Testament, which appeared in 1984. Kropp-Dakubu's 1980 West African language data sheets vol II contains a few pages on Nafaanra put together {{in the late seventies}} by Dean and Carol Jordan, including a phonology, a list of nouns, a list of pronouns, a list of numbers, and some example sentences; tones are not marked. A more detailed phonology of Nafaanra by Jordan, also containing a Swadesh list, appeared in 1980. Several books of Nafana folk tales have been published by the Summer Institute of Linguistics. Mensah and Tchagbale in their 1983 linguistic atlas of Ivory Coast include a comparative Senufo <b>word</b> <b>list</b> of about 120 items; Nafaanra is present under the name [...] "Nafara of Bondoukou". An orthography of Nafaanra, lacking tonal marking, is included in Hartell (1993).
