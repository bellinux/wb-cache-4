5|$|Melatonin is a {{powerful}} antioxidant. Melatonin easily crosses cell membranes and the blood–brain barrier. Unlike other antioxidants, melatonin does not undergo redox cycling, which {{is the ability of}} a molecule to undergo repeated reduction and oxidation.

Melatonin, once oxidized, cannot be reduced to its former state because it forms several stable end-products upon reacting <b>with</b> <b>free</b> radicals. Therefore, it has been referred to as a terminal (or suicidal) antioxidant.|$|E
