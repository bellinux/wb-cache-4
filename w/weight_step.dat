It was verified the performance of both algorithms {{compared to that of}} the ML one. The behavior of the GC- 2 algorithm was investigated for estimating the analog <b>weight</b> (<b>Step</b> 4) according to the variation of its parameters (t[*]and p), while the WED algorithm was examined for a new proposed reliability according to the variation of its parameters (t and Q). To estimate the complexity of each algorithm, it was computed the number of arithmetic operations per decoded sequence. An analysis of the trade-off between performance and complexity of the algorithms was performed for each protection class assuming various configuration options. These analyses led us to conclude that, when choosing the parameters of the algorithms, the increase of the error-correcting capability of the binary decoder (t) was more advantageous in both cases. In addition, choosing the values of p[*]and Q[*]such that γ[*]is close to one (for a fixed value of t), it was verified that the GC- 2 algorithm is less complex, while the WED algorithm can offer (depending on the code adopted) a performance closer to the ML one.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} shown by Roger Jang in his paper titled "Adaptive-network-based fuzzy {{inference}} systems" that the Adaptive Network based Fuzzy Inference System can model nonlinear functions, identify nonlinear components in a control system, and predict a chaotic time series. The system use hybrid-learning procedure which employs the back-propagation-type gradient descent algorithm and the least squares estimator to estimate parameters of the model. However the learning procedure has several shortcomings {{due to the fact}} that *	There is a harmful and unforeseeable influence of the size of the partial derivative on the <b>weight</b> <b>step</b> in the back-propagation-type gradient descent algorithm. *In some cases the matrices in the least square estimator can be ill-conditioned. *Several estimators are known which dominate, or outperform, the least square estimator.

40|$|Advisor: David S. SenchinaAnatomically, {{males and}} females have many differences. Females {{tend to have a}} wider pelvis than males. Traditionally, males have longer limbs as well as larger muscle mass. Based on these facts, we {{hypothesized}} that females will have a larger step width and males will have a larger step length. Also, we hypothesized that the addition of carrying 15 % body weight would affect the males gait less. This study was conducted to investigate gender differences in gait. The subject was asked to walk normally across three strips of paper, and then walk across the paper again while carrying a box, which weighed 15 % of their body <b>weight.</b> <b>Step</b> width and step length measurements were then taken from the ink marks on the Kraft paper. The average step length in normal walking for males was 74. 8 cm and in females was 78. 7 cm. When 15 % of the subjects body weight was added the average step length for males was 74. 5 cm and females was 76. 3 cm. In normal walking, the males averaged 7. 712 cm and the females averaged 7. 94 cm for step width. In walking with 15 % of body weight, males averaged 8. 9 cm and females averaged 8. 85 cm for step width. It’s hard to make conclusions about gender differences in gait for this study because we had a limited number of subjects. But, we can conclude when a person is carrying a box full of weights versus walking normally, step length decreases and step width increases to increase ones balance.

We examined changes in these parameters following training in time- efficient preparation of balanced, low- energy meals combined with pedometer- based step count monitoring. Methods Seventy- two adults with DM 2 were enrolled in a 24 - week program (i. e., 15 three- hour group sessions). They prepared meals under a chef’s supervision, and discussed eating behaviours/nutrition with a registered dietitian. They maintained a record of pedometer- assessed step counts. We evaluated changes from baseline to 24 weeks in terms of <b>weight,</b> <b>step</b> counts, hemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c, glycemic control), blood pressure, and eating control ability (Weight Efficacy Lifestyle WEL Questionnaire). 53 participants (73. 6 %) completed assessments. Results There were improvements in eating control (11. 2 point WEL score change, 95 % CI 4. 7 to 17. 8), step counts (mean change 869 steps/day, 95 % CI 198 to 1, 540), weight (mean change − 2. 2 %; 95 % CI − 3. 6 to − 0. 8), and HbA 1 c (mean change − 0. 3 % HbA 1 c, 95 % CI − 0. 6 to − 0. 1), as well as suggestion of systolic blood pressure reduction (mean change − 3. 5 mm Hg, 95 % CI − 7. 8 to 0. 9). Findings were not attributable to medication changes. In linear regression models (adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, insulin use, season), a − 2. 5 % weight change {{was associated with a}} − 0. 3 % HbA 1 c change (95 % CI − 0. 4 to − 0. 2) and a − 3. 5 % systolic blood pressure change (95 % CI − 5. 5 to − 1. 4). Conclusions In this ‘proof of concept’ study, persistence with the program led to improvements in eating and physical activity habits, glycemia reductions, and suggestion of blood pressure lowering effects. The strategy thus merits further study and development to expand the range of options for vascular risk reduction in DM 2. </p...|$|E
40|$|Lost Iron – {{requirement}} {{and consumption}} of iron and steel in agriculture in medieval Sweden This study aims at an estimation {{of the amount of}} iron required for agriculture during the Middle Ages in Sweden. To calculate this we need to know which implements were used, their weights and how they were subjected to wear. Research on wear has been very scarce but it is of great importance to measure how much iron that was needed to replace what was taken away by constant wear, i. e. on shares for ploughs and ards. To achieve this a new method was devised. The method is based on previous research by Grith Lerche, with additional analyses and calculations. The method presented and used is called Wear Calculation Method and consists of five steps. Step 1 : Study of medieval agricultural implements, their shape and <b>weight.</b> <b>Step</b> 2 : Metallurgical analysis of selected implements, to answer questions about materials and how they were processed. Step 3 : Experimental Archaeology: Manufacture of replicas of the implements analyzed in step 2. Step 4 : Experimental Archaeology: ard ploughing and haymaking with replicas of ard shares and scythes for the purpose of measuring wear. Step 5 : Analysis of the wear experiment, results and calculations of consumption of iron and steel in medieval agriculture. The experimental part of the thesis focuses on ard shares and scythes, since the ard and the scythe were the main implements for ploughing and haymaking during the Middle Ages in Sweden. These experiments were carried out during two seasons at Östra Järvafältet, north of Stockholm, Sweden. I have measured wear on the ard shares in grams per kilometer. But more relevant and often more compatible with data from written sources is a measure of how many grams that are worn off per hectare or any other given unit of land. The wear is approximated at 100 grams of iron and steel per ploughed hectare (10 000 m 2), in conditions similar to the situation when the replicas were used. I chose to do my analyses on two different spatial levels, the farm and the county. The results prove that ard ploughing means much heavier wear on the implements compared to haymaking. Generally you needed an annual addition of slightly over 1 kg of iron to plough the fields of a normal-sized farm in Uppland. Thus we may estimate the total amount of iron required in Uppland to replace the wear caused by ploughing to 8, 4 ton a year. These results show that iron and steel production were of great importance for the High Medieval economic expansion and modernization, where increased iron production and consumption as well as simultaneous expansion of arable land were vital. Between {{the end of the first}} millennium and the mid- 14 th century, the population of Sweden approximately doubled in size, much like the rest of Europe. Iron was a most important third factor (in combination with an increased population and the cultivation of new land) in this expanding age, ca AD 1000 – 1300. Production {{and consumption of}} iron and steel increased sharply during this period and it reached every person, farm, meadow and field in the country. This is a sure sign of a very developed market and system for the distribution of iron and steel...|$|E

40|$|Large-scale {{longwall}} mining of shallow coal seams may cause mining-induced fractures that can project completely {{through to the}} surface. This {{could lead to a}} series of mine safety and environmental issues, further deteriorating the already fragile ecological environment in the Western mining areas in China.

Even though citizenship was used at some point during the weighting process, (similarly to other countries), it was not benchmarked to population totals in the final step, so that an almost perfect alignment could not be achieved. As a result, the weighted proportion of non-German individuals in the PIAAC sample was 9.4 %, compared to 10.7 % in the 2010 Microcensus data (Zabal et al. 2014, p. 88).|$|R
