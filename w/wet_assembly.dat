50|$|Phosphorene is a 2-dimensional, {{crystalline}} allotrope of phosphorus. Its mono-atomic {{hexagonal structure}} makes it conceptually similar to graphene. However, phosphorene has substantially different electronic properties; in particular it possesses a nonzero band gap while displaying high electron mobility. This property potentially {{makes it a}} better semiconductor than graphene. The synthesis of phosphorene mainly consists of micromechanical cleavage or liquid phase exfoliation methods. The former has a low yield while the latter produce free standing nanosheets in solvent {{and not on the}} solid support. The bottom up approaches like chemical vapor deposition are still blank because of its high reactivity. Therefore, in the current scenario, the most effective method for large area fabrication of thin films of phosphorene consists of <b>wet</b> <b>assembly</b> techniques like Langmuir-Blodgett involving the assembly followed by deposition of nanosheets on solid supports.|$|E

50|$|The {{high yield}} {{production}} of phosphorene {{has been demonstrated}} by many groups in solvents, but to realize the potential applications of this material, {{it is crucial to}} deposit these free-standing nanosheets in solvents systematically on substrates. H. Kaur et al. demonstrated the synthesis, interface driven alignment and subsequent functional properties of few layer semiconducting phosphorene using Langmuir-Blodgett assembly. This is the first study which provides a straightforward and versatile solution towards the challenge of assembling nanosheets of phosphorene onto various supports and subsequently use these sheets in an electronic device. Therefore, <b>wet</b> <b>assemblies</b> techniques like Langmuir-Blodgett serves as a very valuable new entry point for the exploration of electronic as well as opto-electronic properties of phosphorene as well as other 2D layered inorganic materials.|$|R

40|$|A glassblock {{integrated}} with hybrid photovoltaic cells (also known as Dye-sensitized Solar Cell - DSC) and a dry-assembled panel made of traditional or DSC-integrated glassblocks are disclosed. The {{combination of the}} glassblock and the DSC module, allows {{the improvement of the}} glassblock performance in terms of energy saving and production. The final complete product owns the qualities of both the components (glassblock and DSC module) that are optimized to produce clean energy. The transparency and the thermo-acoustic insulation of the glassblock may be modulated according to the specific requirements of each case of installation. Since the DSCs can be printed in different colours and with various patterns, it is possible to intervene also on the glassblock aesthetical aspect and to easily make drawings on the building façades, thanks to the modularity of the glassblock and the panel. Moreover, DSCs can be energetically active in different light conditions (even in diffuse light, also converting internal artificial light) and independently from the angle of the solar radiation. The invention presents seven Hypotheses of integration of the DSCs with glassblock and the system to assemble the new product and/or the traditional glassblock in prestressed panels, which constitute the building envelope even in high-rise buildings. This assembly system implies favourable economies in terms of costs and materials, since further technical elements for the construction of the building envelope are no more needed. The supporting structure of the panel is constituted by plastic profiles that are placed in the horizontal and vertical cavities resulting from the juxtaposition of the glassblocks. The supporting structure houses stiffening steel rods and electric connections (in case of DSC-integrated glassblocks for the construction of photovoltaic panels). To overcome the limits due to the <b>wet</b> <b>assembly</b> system, traditionally used to assemble glassblocks, a prestressing force is applied to steel rods in order to confer to the panel an adequate mechanical resistance against the actions perpendicular to its installation plane, such as wind and earthquake. In this configuration the mechanical resistance of the glassblocks is exploited. The unidirectional prestress (along the prevalent dimension of the panel) is obtained through the grip of the nuts inserted in the steel rods, opposing to the steel plates positioned at {{the top and bottom of}} the panel. The steel plates are positioned on plastic plates fixed to the lateral faces of the glassblocks by means of resins...|$|E
40|$|The Assembly Transfer System (ATS) receives, cools, {{and opens}} rail and truck {{transportation}} casks from the Carrier/Cask Handling System (CCHS). The system unloads transportation casks consisting of bare Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF) assemblies, single element canisters, and Dual Purpose Canisters (DPCs). For casks containing DPCs, the system opens the DPCs and unloads the SNF. The system stages the assemblies, transfer assemblies {{to and from}} fuel-blending inventory pools, loads them into Disposal Containers (DCs), temporarily seals and inerts the DC, decontaminates the DC and transfers it to the Disposal Container Handling System. The system also prepares empty casks and DPCs for off-site shipment. Two identical Assembly Transfer System lines are provided in the Waste Handling Building (WHB). Each line operates independently to handle the waste transfer throughput and to support maintenance operations. Each system line primarily consists of wet and dry handling areas. The wet handling area includes a cask transport system, cask and DPC preparation system, and a <b>wet</b> <b>assembly</b> handling system. The basket transport system forms the transition between the wet and dry handling areas. The dry handling area includes the dry assembly handling system, assembly drying system, DC preparation system, and DC transport system. Both the wet and dry handling areas are controlled by the control and tracking system. The system operating sequence begins with moving transportation casks to the cask preparation area. The cask preparation operations consist of cask cavity gas sampling, cask venting, cask cool-down, outer lid removal, and inner shield plug lifting fixture attachment. Casks containing bare SNF (no DPC) are filled with water {{and placed in the}} cask unloading pool. The inner shield plugs are removed underwater. For casks containing a DPC, the cask lid(s) is removed, and the DPC is penetrated, sampled, vented, and cooled. A DPC lifting fixture is attached and the cask is placed into the cask unloading pool. In the cask unloading pool the DPC is removed from the cask and placed in an overpack and the DPC lid is severed and removed. Assemblies are removed from either an open cask or DPC and loaded into assembly baskets positioned in the basket staging rack in the assembly unloading pool. A method called ''blending'' is utilized to load DCs with a heat output of less than 11. 8 kW. This involves combining hotter and cooler assemblies from different baskets. Blending requires storing some of the hotter fuel assemblies in fuel-blending inventory pools until cooler assemblies are available. The assembly baskets are then transferred from the basket staging rack to the assembly handling cell and loaded into the assembly drying vessels. After drying, the assemblies are removed from the assembly drying vessels and loaded into a DC positioned below the DC load port. After installation of a DC inner lid and temporary sealing device, the DC is transferred to the DC decontamination cell where the top area of the DC, the DC lifting collar, and the DC inner lid and temporary sealing device are decontaminated, and the DC is evacuated and backfilled with inert gas to prevent prolonged clad exposure to air. The DC is then transferred to the Disposal Container Handling System for lid welding. In another cask preparation and decontamination area, lids are replaced on the empty transportation casks and DPC overpacks, the casks and DPC overpacks are decontaminated, inspected, and transferred to the Carrier/Cask Handling System for shipment off-site. All system equipment is designed to facilitate manual or remote operation, decontamination, and maintenance. The system interfaces with the Carrier/Cask Handling System for incoming and outgoing transportation casks and DPCs. The system also interfaces with the Disposal Container Handling System, which prepares the DC for loading and subsequently seals the loaded DC. The system support interfaces are the Waste Handling Building System and other internal WHB support systems...|$|E

40|$|Liquid has a {{significant}} effect on the flow of <b>wet</b> granular <b>assemblies.</b> We explore the effects of liquid induced cohesion on the flow characteristics of wet granular materials. We propose a cohesion-scaling approach that enables invariant flow characteristics for different particles sizes in rotating drums. The strength of capillary forces between the particles is significantly reduced by making the glass beads hydrophobic via chemical silanization. Main results of rotating drum experiments are that liquid-induced cohesion decreases both the width of the flowing region and the velocity of the particles at the free surface, but increases the width of the creeping region as well as the dynamic angle of repose. Also, the local granular temperature in the flowing region decreases with an increase of the capillary force. The scaling methodology in the flow regimes considered (rolling and cascading regimes) yields invariant bed flow characteristics for different particle sizes.

40|$|Effective {{control of}} {{morphology}} and electrical connectivity of networks of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) by using rough, nanoporous silica supports of Fe catalyst nanoparticles in catalytic {{chemical vapor deposition}} is demonstrated experimentally. The very high quality of the nanotubes {{is evidenced by the}} G-to-D Raman peak ratios (> 50) within the range of the highest known ratios. Transitions from separated nanotubes on smooth SiO 2 surface to densely interconnected networks on the nanoporous SiO 2 are accompanied by an almost two-order of magnitude increase of the nanotube density. These transitions herald the hardly detectable onset of the nanoscale connectivity and are confirmed by the microanalysis and electrical measurements. The achieved effective nanotube interconnection leads to the dramatic, almost three-orders of magnitude decrease of the SWCNT network resistivity compared to networks of similar density produced by <b>wet</b> chemistry-based <b>assembly</b> of preformed nanotubes. The growth model, supported by multiscale, multiphase modeling of SWCNT nucleation reveals multiple constructive roles of the porous catalyst support in facilitating the catalyst saturation and SWCNT nucleation, consistent with the observed higher density of longer nanotubes. The associated mechanisms are related to the unique surface conditions (roughness, wettability, and reduced catalyst coalescence) on the porous SiO 2 and the increased carbon supply through the supporting porous structure. This approach is promising for the direct integration of SWCNT networks into Si-based nanodevice platforms and multiple applications ranging from nanoelectronics and energy conversion to bio- and environmental sensing...|$|R
40|$|Heat {{transfer}} through {{clothing is}} an important topic related to thermal comfort in environmental engineering and functional clothing design. The total heat transmitted through clothing is commonly considered as {{the sum of the}} dry heat transfer and the evaporative heat transfer. Clothing thermal insulation measured in a nonperspiring con dition, e. g., on a dry thermal manikin, is frequently used to calculate the dry heat transfer when the body is perspiring or even sweating heavily. The effect of perspiration on clothing thermal insulation with respect to dry heat transfer is not well understood, although it is widely speculated that perspiration reduces thermal insulation by <b>wetting</b> clothing <b>assemblies.</b> In this investigation, clothing thermal insulation with very low perspiration and very heavy perspiration is measured using a novel perspiring fabric thermal manikin. Clothing thermal insulation decreases during perspiration, and the amount of reduction varies from 2 to 8 %, as related to water accumulation within clothing ensembles. This finding suggests the "after chill" effect of wearers after heavy exercise may not only be caused by heat absorption due to the desorption and evaporation of water within clothing, but also to reduced clothing thermal insulation. Also, for clothing that can absorb a large amount of moisture during sweating, clothing thermal insulation measured on dry manikins may need to be corrected when used for calculating dry heat loss (sometimes used for calculating moisture vapor resistance) on a sweating manikin and predicting thermal comfort during sweating.

40|$|Failure and strain-localization in {{granular}} {{soils and}} porous rocks subjected to high pressures involves considerable alteration of the microstructure. Such processes {{are affected by}} the grainsize characteristics (e. g., grain size distribution and mean grain size), as well as by environmental variables such as moisture content and capillary pressure. In this contribution, we use a reformulation of the Breakage Mechanics theory to model comminution in <b>wet</b> granular <b>assemblies.</b> By using an extensive dataset for sands, we quantify the relation between a geometric descriptor of the assembly (i. e., the mean grainsize) and the constants that control the suction air-entry value and the stress threshold at the onset of crushing. Such relations are used to define contrasting scenarios for the coupling between degree of saturation and yielding. In the first scenario, the suction air-entry value scales inversely with the mean grainsize (as suggested by the capillary theory), whereas the energy input for comminution is assumed to be independent {{of the size of the}} grains. The outcome of this assumption is that changes in degree of saturation play a more intense role in finer gradings. In contrast, if we assume that the energy input for grain breakage scales inversely with the size of the particles (e. g., in accordance with scaling laws inspired by linear elastic fracture mechanics), the effect of the degree of saturation is predicted to be stronger in coarser assemblies. These results provide a theoretical basis to infer the relation between continuum-scale properties of soils and rocks (e. g., the yielding stress at the onset of crushing) and basic attributes widely used for soil/rock characterization (e. g., the grain size distribution) ...|$|R

50|$|The {{industry}} has recognized {{that in many}} circumstances it may be impractical to design and build building assemblies which never get wet. Good design and practice involve controlling the <b>wetting</b> of building <b>assemblies</b> from both the exterior and interior. So, the use of vapor barrier {{should be taken into}} consideration. Their use has already been legislated within the building code of some countries (such as the U.S., Canada, Ireland, England, Scotland & Wales). How, where, and whether a vapor barrier (vapor diffusion retarder) should be used depends on the climate. Typically, the number of heating degree days (HDD) in an area is used to help make these determinations. A heating degree day is a unit that measures how often outdoor daily dry-bulb temperatures fall below an assumed base, normally 18°C (65°F). For building in most parts of North America, where winter heating conditions predominate, vapor barrier are placed toward the interior, heated side of insulation in the assembly. In humid regions where warm-weather cooling predominates within buildings, the vapor barrier should be located toward the exterior side of insulation. In relatively mild or balanced climates, or where assemblies are designed to minimize condensation conditions, a vapor barrier may not be necessary at all.|$|R

40|$|In this dissertation, we have {{investigated}} the fabrication, mechanical instability and applications of two kinds of polymer micro/nano-structures: high-aspect-ratio (HAR) polymer pillar arrays, and periodic porous elastomer membranes. ^ For HAR polymer pillar arrays, we demonstrated the fabrication of high-aspect-ratio (up to 18) polymer micropillars with different shapes and dimensions by replica molding. Capillary force lithography (CFL) is also demonstrated as a simple and flexible method to fabricate microstructures with controlled aspect ratios. Meanwhile, by introducing conventional photoresist SU- 8, CFL is successfully coupled with photolithography and used to create hierarchical 2 D or 3 D structures, which greatly expand the capability of current capillary force lithography. The mechanical stability of HAR structures with varied materials and different aspect ratio, density and shape were also studied and {{the results show that}} the adhesive forces from environment are the major cause of structure collapsing. When HAR polymer pillars are subjected to different solvents treatment, both capillary force and solvent swelling need to be considered to completely understand the structure instability. ^ On HAR micropillar array, thermoresponsive polymer brushes, poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm), were selectively grafted at different locations for dynamically tuning surface <b>wetting</b> or pattern <b>assembly.</b> When the temperature changed from 40 °C to 20 °, depending on the location of polymer brushes, different wetting transitions, either from a composite solid/air state (Cassie state) to a composite solid/liquid state (Hemi-wicking state) or a transition between two Cassie states were observed. Meanwhile, the dynamically tuning of water contact angle enables us to control capillary drying force and thus harness pattern collapse to create superlattice micropatterns. ^ For periodic porous elastomer membrane, a novel pattern transformation effect is discovered due to the mechanical instability of membrane under solvent swelling.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to the {{fabrication}} of carbon nanotube structures for microelectronics packaging applications with an emphasis on fundamental studies of nanotube growth and <b>assembly,</b> <b>wetting</b> of nanotube structures, and nanotube-based composites. A CVD process is developed that allows controlled growth of a variety of CNT structures, such as CNT films, bundles, and stacks. Use of an Al 2 O 3 support enhances the Fe catalyst activity by increasing the CNT growth rate by nearly two orders of magnitude under the same growth conditions. By introducing a trace amount of weak oxidants into the CVD chamber during CNT growth, aligned CNT ends can be opened and/or functionalized, depending on the selection of oxidants. By varying the growth temperature, CNT growth can be performed in a gas diffusion- or kinetics-controlled regime. To overcome the challenges that impede implementation of CNTs in circuitry, a CNT transfer process was proposed to assemble aligned CNT structures (films, stacks &bundles) at low temperature which ensures compatibility with current microelectronics fabrication sequences and technology. Field emission and electrical testing of the as-assembled CNT devices indicate good electrical contact between CNTs and solder and a very low contact resistance across CNT/solder interfaces. For attachment of CNTs and other applications (e. g. composites), wetting of nanotube structures was studied. Two model surfaces with two-tier scale roughness were fabricated by controlled growth of CNT arrays followed by coating with fluorocarbon layers formed by plasma polymerization to study roughness geometric effects on superhydrophobicity. Due to the hydrophobicity of nanotube structures, electrowetting was investigated to reduce the hydrophobicity of aligned CNTs by controllably reducing the interfacial tension between carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and liquids. Electrowetting can greatly reduce the contact angle of liquids on the surfaces of aligned CNT films. However, contact angle saturation still occurs. Variable frequency microwave (VFM) radiation can greatly improve the CNT/epoxy interfacial bonding strength. Compared to composites cured by thermal heating, VFM-cured composites demonstrate higher CNT/matrix interfacial bonding strength, which is reflected in composite negative thermal expansion. The improved CNT/epoxy interface enhances the thermal conductivity of the composites by 26 - 30 %. Ph. D. Committee Chair: C. P. Wong; Committee Chair: Dennis W.

40|$|The {{infiltration}} of rainwater {{can result from}} envelope defects that allow water to infiltrate into the stud cavity behind the exterior sheathing, i. e. the back wall.

Therefore, studying the drying potential of wood-frame wall assemblies that {{have been subjected to}} a moisture load like rain infiltration can provide valuable information with respect to the assembly's hygrothermal performance.

The role of the vapor retarder, the exterior insulation, an added exterior insulation, the wall height, the presence of hygroscopic cladding was studied and the effect of varying the moisture load was also investigated. The research was primarily experimental but also included some simulation work. The moisture content results from the experiments show that the sheathing material had the most significant impact on the drying response of the wall components, with the lowest and highest drying rate occurring when OSB and fiberboard sheathings were employed, respectively. Increasing the vapor permeability of the vapor retarder within the range allowed by the National Building Code of Canada increased the drying rate of the wetted components within the walls when OSB sheathing was employed. Comparison of the experimental and numerical results highlighted the difficulties in simulating a three-dimensional problem in a two-dimensional domain, the need for accurate and complete material properties, and the need to include of all relevant transport phenomena like air transport in hygrothermal envelope models to increase the accuracy of the simulation result...|$|R
