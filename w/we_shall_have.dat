25|$|After his {{retirement}} from the bench, Innes was free {{once again to}} express his political views, and especially his staunch Cape liberal commitments. In 1929, when Prime Minister J. B. M. Hertzog was intensifying plans to strip black Africans of their rights, Innes founded the Non-Racial Franchise Association to protect the beleaguered Cape Qualified Franchise and extend it {{to the rest of}} the country. At the Association's opening function he said:"In a comparatively short time, <b>we</b> <b>shall</b> <b>have</b> to deal with a great body of Natives whose education has enabled them to appreciate the value of the political status denied them, and has stimulated their determination to obtain it, and they will be embittered by the grievances, economic and administrative which are bound to accumulate when one section of the people is deprived of those voting rights which its fellow citizens enjoy.|$|E

25|$|If {{the people}} {{come to believe that}} the {{constitution}} is not a text like other texts; if it means, not what it says or what it was understood to mean, but what it should mean, in light of the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society, they will look for qualifications other than impartiality, judgment, and lawyerly acumen in those whom they elect to interpret it. More specifically, they will look for people who agree with them as to what those evolving standards have evolved to; who agree with them as to what the constitution ought to be. If the courts are free to write the constitution anew, they will write it the way the majority wants; the appointment and confirmation process will see to that. This suggests the end of the Bill of Rights, whose meaning will be committed to the very body it was meant to protect against: the majority. By trying to make the constitution do everything that needs doing from age to age, <b>we</b> <b>shall</b> <b>have</b> caused it to do nothing at all.|$|E

500|$|On October 20, 1872, Briggs {{arrived at}} Pier 50 on the East River, New York City, to {{supervise}} the loading of the ship's cargo for Genoa: 1,701 barrels of poisonous denatured alcohol. A week later, Briggs was joined by his wife and baby daughter. On Sunday, November 3, Briggs wrote to his mother, telling her {{that he intended to}} leave on Tuesday, adding that, [...] "Our vessel is in beautiful trim and I hope <b>we</b> <b>shall</b> <b>have</b> a fine passage." ...|$|E

500|$|The Swiss Embassy was, and is, {{located at}} the back of the house at 16-18 Montagu Place, but in August 1965, an embassy {{spokesperson}} complained that Beatles' fans were defacing their back wall (in Bryanston Mews), with messages meant for Starr: [...] "Our back wall is now very unsightly and <b>we</b> <b>shall</b> <b>have</b> to redecorate. Our chauffeur, who is French and took part in the first World War, says the language some of these young people use is worse than anything he ever heard in the trenches".|$|E
500|$|The United Kingdom did {{not have}} the {{manpower}} or resources of the United States, and despite its early and promising start, Tube Alloys fell behind its American counterpart and was dwarfed by it. [...] On 30 July 1942, Anderson advised [...] the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, that: [...] "We must face the fact that... pioneering work... is a dwindling asset and that, unless we capitalise it quickly, we shall be outstripped. We now have a real contribution to make to a 'merger.' Soon <b>we</b> <b>shall</b> <b>have</b> little or none." ...|$|E
500|$|Finally, in mid-August, the Persian {{army was}} sighted across the Malian Gulf {{approaching}} Thermopylae. With the Persian army's arrival at Thermopylae the Greeks held a council of war. Some Peloponnesians suggested withdrawal to the Isthmus of Corinth and blocking the passage to Peloponnesus. The Phocians and Locrians, whose states were located nearby, became indignant and advised defending Thermopylae and sending for more help. Leonidas calmed the panic {{and agreed to}} defend Thermopylae. According to Plutarch, {{when one of the}} soldiers complained that, [...] "Because of the arrows of the barbarians it is impossible to see the sun", Leonidas replied, [...] "Won't it be nice, then, if <b>we</b> <b>shall</b> <b>have</b> shade in which to fight them?" [...] Herodotus reports a similar comment, but attributes it to Dienekes.|$|E
6000|$|... "We shall {{do it all}} ourselves, Tim--that is to say, as far as {{cleaning}} the rifles, washing our linen, and cooking the dinner.

500|$|This disastrously {{affected}} British {{efforts as}} they lacked manpower, facilities, equipment and materials. Tube Alloys therefore fell {{behind in the}} race with the Manhattan Project. On 30 July 1942, Anderson advised Churchill that: [...] "We must {{face the fact that}} ... pioneering work ... is a dwindling asset and that, unless we capitalise it quickly, we shall be outstripped. We now have a real contribution to make to a 'merger'. Soon <b>we</b> <b>shall</b> <b>have</b> little or none". By the time Great Britain realised it, the position had worsened; Bush decided that outside help for the Manhattan Project was no longer needed. The Military Policy Committee (MPC) supported Bush's arguments and restricted access to the classified information which Britain could utilise to develop its atomic weapons programme, even if it slowed down the American efforts.|$|E
500|$|Yet the United Kingdom did {{not have}} the {{manpower}} or resources of the United States, and despite its early and promising start, Tube Alloys fell behind its American counterpart and was dwarfed by it. Britain was spending around £430,000 per year on research and development, and Metropolitan-Vickers was building gaseous diffusion units for uranium enrichment worth £150,000; but the Manhattan Project was spending £8,750,000 on research and development, and had let construction contracts worth £100,000,000 at the fixed wartime rate of four dollars to the pound. On 30 July 1942, Anderson advised [...] the prime minister, Winston Churchill, that: [...] "We must face the fact that... pioneering work... is a dwindling asset and that, unless we capitalise it quickly, we shall be outstripped. We now have a real contribution to make to a 'merger.' Soon <b>we</b> <b>shall</b> <b>have</b> little or none." ...|$|E
500|$|As Cadwalader's {{men began}} to flee, the American guns opened fire onto the British, who were {{preparing}} to attack, and the guns were able to hold them off for several minutes. Cadwalader {{was able to get}} one company to fire a volley but it fled immediately afterwards. At this point, Washington arrived with the Virginia Continentals and Edward Hand's riflemen. Washington ordered the riflemen and the Virginians to take up a position on the right hand side of the hill and then Washington quickly rode over to Cadwalader's fleeing men. Washington shouted, [...] "Parade with us my brave fellows! There is but a handful of the enemy and <b>we</b> <b>shall</b> <b>have</b> them directly!". Cadwalader's men formed into battle formation at Washington's direction. When Daniel Hitchcock's New England Continentals arrived, Washington sent them to the right, where he had put the riflemen and the Virginians.|$|E

500|$|Throughout his presidency, Grant was {{continually}} {{concerned with}} {{the civil rights of}} all Americans, [...] "irrespective of nationality, color, or religion." [...] Grant signed the Civil Rights Act of 1875 that allowed citizens access to public eating establishments, hotels, and places of entertainment. This was done particularly to protect African Americans who were discriminated across United States. The bill was also passed in honor of Senator Charles Sumner who had previously attempted to pass a civil rights bill in 1872. In his sixth message to Congress, he summed up his own views, [...] "While I remain Executive all the laws of Congress and the provisions of the Constitution... will be enforced with rigor... Treat the Negro as a citizen and a voter, as he is and must remain... Then <b>we</b> <b>shall</b> <b>have</b> no complaint of sectional interference." [...] In the pursued equal justice for all category from the 2009 CSPAN Presidential rating survey Grant scored a 9 getting into the top ten.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to the initial airborne and naval landings, just after noon on 6June, 21st Panzer Division received permission to attack. The commanders were informed by General Erich Marcks of LXXXVII Army Corps that:"if you don't succeed in throwing the British back into the sea, <b>we</b> <b>shall</b> <b>have</b> lost the war." [...] East of the River Orne, the 125th Panzergrenadier Regiment headed towards the captured bridges. The column was quickly spotted and engaged {{for the next two}} hours by Allied artillery and aircraft causing heavy losses. At 16:00, {{to the west of the}} Caen canal, 1st Battalion, 192nd Panzergrenadier Regiment and the 100th Panzer Regiment successfully reached the coast between the British Sword and the Canadian Juno. Here they linked up with the 736th Infantry Regiment, which had been defending Lion sur Mer. The German units gathered their strength on the beaches and waited for further orders from divisional commander Generalmajor Edgar Feuchtinger.|$|E
500|$|On 17 September 1805, after {{completing}} a small refit of his ship in Portsmouth, Captain Harvey was superseded {{in command of}} Agamemnon by Captain Sir Edward Berry, who had previously commanded Nelson's flagship, , at the Battle of the Nile. On 3 October she departed Spithead to join Vice-Admiral Nelson's fleet blockading Villeneuve's combined fleet in Cádiz. En route, Agamemnon fell in with a French squadron, consisting of six ships {{of the line and}} several smaller vessels, which gave chase. Succeeding in evading the French, Agamemnon joined the blockading squadron on 13 October, and when Nelson laid eyes on the approaching ship he reportedly exclaimed: [...] "Here comes that damned fool Berry! Now <b>we</b> <b>shall</b> <b>have</b> a battle!" [...] In misty conditions on 20 October, Agamemnon captured a large American merchant brig, which she then took in tow. Not long after, [...] signalled to Agamemnon that she was sailing straight towards an enemy fleet of 30 ships—Villeneuve's fleet had left port.|$|E
