5|$|As the 19th century wore on non-conformist ministers {{increasingly}} {{began to}} conduct services within the workhouse, but Catholic priests were rarely welcomed. A variety of legislation {{had been introduced}} during the 17th century to limit {{the civil rights of}} Catholics, beginning with the Popish Recusants Act 1605 {{in the wake of the}} failed Gunpowder Plot that year. But although almost all restrictions on Catholics in England and Ireland were removed by the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829, a great deal of anti-Catholic feeling remained. Even in areas with large Catholic populations, such as Liverpool, the appointment of a Catholic chaplain <b>was</b> <b>unthinkable.</b> Some guardians went so far as to refuse Catholic priests entry to the workhouse.|$|E

Before the airing of season 10 commenced, Welling argued that, for him, Luthor's return would have to be the inspiration for Clark to finally become Superman, because the idea of one character without the other <b>was</b> <b>unthinkable.</b>|$|E

500|$|After {{weeks of}} {{fighting}} and cannon bombardment of the Armenian villages, the Ottoman forces and Kurdish irregulars suppressed the uprising by May 1904; they outnumbered the Armenian forces several times. Minor clashes occurred thereafter. According to Christopher J. Walker, the fedayi came [...] "near to organising an uprising and shaking Ottoman power in Armenia", but [...] "even then it <b>was</b> <b>unthinkable</b> that the empire would lose {{any of her}} territory, since the idea of intervention was far from Russia". Trotsky wrote that international attention was on the Russo-Japanese War and the uprising went largely unnoticed by the European powers and Russia.|$|E
500|$|By {{the early}} 1930s, all {{properties}} belonging to Armenians who {{were subject to}} deportation had been confiscated. Since then, no restitution of property confiscated during the Armenian Genocide has taken place. The laws concerning abandoned property remained in effect for 73 years until it was finally abolished on 11 June 1986. The mass confiscation of properties provided the opportunity for ordinary lower class Turks (i.e. peasantry, soldiers, and laborers) {{to rise to the}} ranks of the middle class. Contemporary Turkish historian Uğur Ümit Üngör asserts that [...] "the elimination of the Armenian population left the state an infrastructure of Armenian property, which was used for the progress of Turkish (settler) communities. In other words: the construction of an étatist Turkish [...] "national economy" [...] <b>was</b> <b>unthinkable</b> without the destruction and expropriation of Armenians." ...|$|E
500|$|The Kingdom of This World {{takes place}} prior to, during, {{and after the}} Haitian Revolution which began in 1791 {{and led to the}} {{declaration}} of Haitian independence in 1804. This revolution was a turning point in global history because it <b>was</b> <b>unthinkable</b> that such a massive anti-slavery revolt would not only take place, but also be successful; therefore, it challenged the prejudices of its time and ultimately influenced abolitionist movements throughout the Americas. Haitians became the second nation to break from their European colonizer (following the US). The Haitian revolution differed from the American revolution however, as it involved the formation of a new national identity. [...] Unlike in the US, the entire social and economic order that had been put in place through the practice of plantation slavery in Haiti was transformed.|$|E

500|$|In the 1880s Saint-Saëns {{continued}} to seek {{success in the}} opera house, an undertaking made the more difficult by an entrenched belief among influential members of the musical establishment that it <b>was</b> <b>unthinkable</b> that a pianist, organist and symphonist could write a good opera. He had two operas staged during the decade, the first being Henry VIII (1883) commissioned by the Paris Opéra. Although the libretto was not of his choosing, Saint-Saëns, normally a fluent, even facile composer, worked at the score with unusual diligence to capture a convincing air of 16th-century England. The work was a success, and was frequently revived during the composer's lifetime. When it was produced at Covent Garden in 1898, The Era commented that though French librettists generally [...] "make a pretty hash of British history", this piece was [...] "not altogether contemptible as an opera story".|$|E
500|$|News of {{the armed}} {{standoff}} at the Carrier house attracted white men {{from all over the}} state to take part. [...] Reports were carried in the St. Petersburg Independent, the Florida Times-Union, the Miami Herald, and The Miami Metropolis, in versions of competing facts and overstatement. The Miami Metropolis listed 20 black people and four white people dead and characterized the event as a [...] "race war". National newspapers also put the incident on the front page. The Washington Post and St. Louis Dispatch described a band of [...] "heavily armed Negroes" [...] and a [...] "negro desperado" [...] as being involved. Most of the information came from discrete messages from Sheriff Walker, mob rumors, and other embellishments to part-time reporters who wired their stories to the Associated Press. Details about the armed standoff were particularly explosive. [...] According to historian Thomas Dye, [...] "The idea that blacks in Rosewood had taken up arms against the white race <b>was</b> <b>unthinkable</b> in the Deep South".|$|E
500|$|Eric Lenneberg, Noam Chomsky, and Steven Pinker {{have also}} criticized Whorf {{for failing to}} be {{sufficiently}} clear in his formulation of how language influences thought, and for failing to provide real evidence to support his assumptions. Generally Whorf's arguments {{took the form of}} examples that were anecdotal or speculative, and functioned as attempts to show how [...] "exotic" [...] grammatical traits were connected to what were considered equally exotic worlds of thought. Even Whorf's defenders admitted that his writing style was often convoluted and couched in neologisms– attributed to his awareness of language use, and his reluctance to use terminology that might have pre-existing connotations. [...] argues that Whorf was mesmerized by the foreignness of indigenous languages, and exaggerated and idealized them. According to Lakoff, Whorf's tendency to exoticize data must be judged in the historical context: Whorf and the other Boasians wrote at a time in which racism and jingoism were predominant, and when it <b>was</b> <b>unthinkable</b> to many that [...] "savages" [...] had redeeming qualities, or that their languages were comparable in complexity to those of Europe. For this alone Lakoff argues, Whorf can be considered to be [...] "Not just a pioneer in linguistics, but a pioneer as a human being".|$|E

500|$|Kanhopatra is {{formally}} {{included in}} the list of Sants, meaning saints in Marathi in the text Bhaktavijaya. Mahipati (1715–1790), a traditional biographer of Marathi saints, devotes an entire chapter to her in his Bhaktavijaya extolling her devotion to Vithoba. In his Bhaktalilamrita Mahipati refers to Kanhopatra as one of the saints who sit surrounding Krishna (identified with Vithoba in Maharashtra). Kanhopatra is cited by the Vakari saint-poets as [...] "an example of the real downtrodden and deserving people persons that are saved by the merciful God". In one of his abhangas, the Varkari saint and poet Tukaram (1577 – c.1650) uses the example of Kanhopatra and other famous saints who were low in the social caste hierarchy, to illustrate that caste is irrelevant when compared with devotion and merit. Her death and her surrender to Vithoba is regarded as a [...] "great legacy of self respect combined with spiritualism." [...] Kanhopatra is considered unique since she is the only prominent woman in Maharashtra who rose to fame without a traditional family backing. She was born in a household where devotion <b>was</b> <b>unthinkable.</b> She is the only woman Varkari saint, who is not associated with any male Varkari saint, who has no guru, [...] nor any parampara (tradition or lineage). She is credited to have attained sainthood exclusively on the basis of her intense devotion to Vithoba, a devotion reflected in her abhangas.|$|E
500|$|The Lord Protector, in his proclamations, {{appealed to}} the common people. To his colleagues, whom he hardly consulted, he {{displayed}} a distinctly autocratic and [...] "increasingly contemptuous" [...] face. By autumn 1549 the same councillors who had made him Protector were convinced that {{he had failed to}} exercise proper authority and was unwilling to listen to good counsel. Dudley still had the troops from the Norfolk campaign at his disposal, and in October 1549 he joined the Earl of Southampton and the Earl of Arundel, prominent religious conservatives, to lead a coup of councillors to oust the Protector from office. They withdrew from court to London, meeting in Dudley's residence. Starting with the Protector, each side issued proclamations accusing the other of treason and declared to act in defence of the King's safety. Somerset tried in vain to raise a popular force and entrenched himself with the King at the fortress Windsor Castle. Military force near King Edward's presence <b>was</b> <b>unthinkable</b> and, apparently, Dudley and Archbishop Cranmer brokered an unofficial deal with Somerset, who surrendered. To keep appearances, the 12-year-old King personally commanded his uncle's arrest. For a moment there was hope of a conservative restoration in some quarters. However, Dudley and Cranmer secured the Reformed agenda by persuading Edward to appoint additional Reformed-minded members to the Council and Privy Chamber. In December 1549 Southampton tried to regain predominance by charging Dudley with treason, alongside Somerset, for having been an original ally of the Protector. The scheme misfired when Dudley invited the Council to his house and baffled the plotters by exclaiming, with his hand at his sword and [...] "a warlike visage": [...] "my lord, you seek his [...] blood and he that seeketh his blood would have mine also".|$|E
500|$|While the {{character}} development {{was met with}} praise, other critics seemed to felt otherwise. Richard Eisenbeis from Kotaku was critical to Boruto's development, as he felt that his bond with his father {{at the end of}} the Boruto film <b>was</b> <b>unthinkable</b> and weak. Thais Valdivia from Hobby Consolas stated that while viewers of the film may initially dislike Boruto's personality, his character arc helps to make him more appealing adding his fight alongside Naruto and Sasuke as one of the highlights. Chris Beveridge from the Fandom Post disliked the large focus between Naruto and Boruto's relationship on the first chapter of the Boruto manga. Nevertheless, he enjoyed the foreshadow of an older Boruto on a fight against an unknown character. For the anime, Beveridge remarked Boruto's characterization which he felt was superior to the one from the manga. Sam Stewart from IGN felt Boruto's personality was [...] "far less enthused" [...] as the reviewer commented he found {{the character}}'s dislike toward his father misguided and finding types of stories too common in fiction. In a review from the manga, Nick Smith from ICv2 found Boruto as the weak part of the series due to his personality that contrasted the Naruto in the original Naruto series. He also said [...] "The politicking within the power structure surrounding Naruto and Boruto becomes more interesting than Boruto himself" [...] and as a result expected Boruto to change in upcoming chapters to make the series more appealing. However, Melina Dargis liked how Boruto realizes his father's goals and joined Sasuke and the Kages in order to save Naruto. Additionally, Dargis noted Boruto's early strained relationship with his father as well as his use of technology to fight might reflect on modern audiences who might understand his character more as a result. As the character developed, Stewart enjoyed Boruto due to his childish personality as he starts acting like a hero from an action film he just watched worrying his family in the process. Additionally, the reviewer liked how Boruto's mysterious [...] "Eye Technique" [...] started making references to a previous Naruto film. Theatergoers for the Boruto film were given two different types of fans with one of them using Boruto and Naruto's images.|$|E
