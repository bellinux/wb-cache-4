40|$|We propose {{and build}} Tiny ORAM, an ORAM {{construction}} that improves {{the state of}} the art Path ORAM in several dimensions. First, through a construction that we call RAW Path ORAM, we reduce the number of symmetric encryption operations by 4 × compared with Path ORAM. Raw Path ORAM also dramatically simplifies the theoretical analysis on the client’s storage requirement (stash size). Second, we propose an integrity verification scheme that is asymptotically more efficient than prior work for position-based ORAMs. Third, through a construction that we call Unified Path ORAM, we reduce the empirical overhead of the recursive ORAM construction. We demonstrate and evaluate a working prototype on a stock FPGA board. Of independent interest, Tiny ORAM is the <b>first</b> hardware ORAM <b>design</b> to support small client storage and arbitrary block sizes (e. g., 64 Bytes to 4096 Bytes). Block size flexibility allows Tiny ORAM to greatly reduce the worst-case access latency for ORAM running programs with erratic data locality.

Oblivious RAM is a cryptographic primitive that completely obfuscates an application’s data, access pattern, and read/write behavior to/from external memory (such as DRAM or disk). Tiny ORAM makes two main contributions. First, by removing an algorithmic bottleneck in prior work, Tiny ORAM is the <b>first</b> hardware ORAM <b>design</b> to support arbitrary block sizes (e. g., 64 Bytes to 4096 Bytes). With a 64 Byte block size, Tiny ORAM can finish an access in 1. 4 µs, over 40 X {{faster than the}} prior-art implementation. Second, through novel algorithmic and engineering-level optimizations, Tiny ORAM reduces the number of symmetric encryption operations by ~ 3 X compared to a prior work. Tiny ORAM <b>is</b> <b>also</b> the <b>first</b> <b>design</b> to implement and report real numbers {{for the cost of}} symmetric encryption in hardware ORAM constructions.

40|$|Abstract Continuous-flow thermal {{gradient}} PCR {{is a new}} DNA amplification technique that is characterized by periodic temperature ramping with no cyclic hold times. The device reported in this article represents the first dem-onstration of hold-less thermocycling within continuous-flow PCR microfluidics. This <b>is</b> <b>also</b> the <b>first</b> <b>design</b> in which continuous-flow PCR is performed within a single steady-state temperature zone. This allows for straightfor-ward miniaturization of the channel footprint, shown in this device which has a cycle length of just 2. 1 cm. With a linear {{thermal gradient}} established across the glass device, the heating and cooling ramp rates are dictated by the fluid velocity relative to the temperature gradient. Local channel orientation and cross-sectional area regulate this velocity. Thus, rapid thermocycling occurs while the PCR chip is maintained at steady state temperatures and flow rates. Glass PCR chips (25 × 75 × 2 mm) of both 30 and 40 serpentine cycles have been fabricated, and were used to amplify a variety of targets, including a 181 -bp segment of a viral phage DNA (ΦX 174) and a 108 -bp segment of the Y-chromosome, amplified from human genomic DNA. With this unique combination of hold-less cycling and gradient temperature ramping, a 40 -cycle PCR requires less than 9 min, with the resulting amplicon having high yield and specificity...|$|R
40|$|Interference {{alignment}} (IA) {{has recently}} been used for the transceiver design of the K-user constant MIMO interference channel. Since this system is a coordinated beamforming system {{and there are other}} design criteria, it is important to evaluate IA transceiver designs in light of other designs. In this paper, relationships between IA and the MMSE, Max Min SINR, Max Sum Capacity, and Min BER transceiver designs are rigorously established for all SNR&rsquo;s and power constraints. A MMSE based transceiver design approach, applicable for general linear equality power constraints, <b>is</b> <b>also</b> proposed&mdash;the <b>first</b> such <b>design</b> for this system. It is used, along with some IA transceiver designs, to demonstrate numerically the derived relationships and to perform a comparison of the designs.

40|$|A Robust Dynamic Inversion (RDI) {{flight control}} law is {{designed}} for a large civil aircraft. Classical Dynamic Inversion (CDI) consists of a nonlinear part that linearizes the nominal system dynamics, and a linear part, basically PID control, that imposes the desired closed-loop dynamics. However, CDI controllers have very poor robustness properties since they rely on exact availability of the system dynamics. It is well-known that within the Structured Singular Value (SSV), or ¯-framework one can explicitly deal with systems subject to uncertainties. This holds for both, the analysis {{as well as for}} the synthesis problem. It is shown that ¯-synthesis in combination with Dynamic Inversion (DI) provides robust control solutions that <b>are</b> <b>also</b> gain-scheduled. We <b>first</b> <b>design</b> a CDI controller.

40|$|In {{practical}} {{data integration}} systems, {{it is common}} for the data sources being integrated to provide conflicting information about the same entity. Consequently, a major challenge for data integration is to derive the most complete and accurate integrated records from diverse and sometimes conflicting sources. We term this challenge the truth finding problem. We observe that some sources are generally more reliable than others, and therefore a good model of source quality is the key to solving the truth finding problem. In this work, we propose a probabilistic graphical model that can automatically infer true records and source quality without any supervision. In contrast to previous methods, our principled approach leverages a generative process of two types of errors (false positive and false negative) by modeling two different aspects of source quality. In so doing, ours <b>is</b> <b>also</b> the <b>first</b> approach <b>designed</b> to merge multi-valued attribute types. Our method is scalable, due to an efficient sampling-based inference algorithm that needs very few iterations in practice and enjoys linear time complexity, with an even faster incremental variant. Experiments on two real world datasets show that our new method outperforms existing state-ofthe-art approaches to the truth finding problem. 1...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMonophasic {{and single}} {{capacitor}} and dual capacitor biphasic truncated exponential shocks {{were tested in}} pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs with use of a nonthoracotomy internal defibrillation pathway consisting of a right ventricular catheter electrode and a subcutaneous chest wall patch electrode. Seven dogs weighing 20. 2 ± 0. 5 kg were utilized. Monophasic pulses of 10 ms duration were compared with three biphasic pulses. All biphasic waveforms had an initial positive phase (PI) followed by a terminal negative phase (P 2) and the total duration of Pt Plus P 2 was 10 ms. The dual capacitor biphasic waveform (PI 9 ms, P 2 1 ms) had equal initial voltages of Pt and P 2. Two simulated single capacitor biphasic waveforms <b>were</b> <b>also</b> tested, the <b>first</b> <b>designed</b> to minimize the magnitude of P 2 (P 19 ms, P 21 ms with initial voltage of P 2 equal to 0. 3 of the initial voltage of P 1) and the second to maximize P 2 (PI 5 ms, P 2 5 ms with initial voltage of P 2 = 0. 5 PI). Alternating current was used to induce ventricular fibrillation and four trials of eight initial voltages from 100 to 800 V were performed {{for each of the}} four waveforms. Stepwise logistic regression was utilized to construct curves relating probability of successful defibrillation and energy. In the logistic model, the dual capacitor biphasic and single capacitor biphasic waveforms that maximized P 2 were associated with significantly (p < 0. 001) lower energy requirements for defibrillation than those of the monophasic waveform. The single capacitor biphasic waveform that minimized P 2 was not significantly better than the monophasic waveform. The biphasic waveforms associated with the lowest energy requirements for defibrillation were characterized by a higher P 2 /PI energy ratio. These results demonstrate that single capacitor biphasic waveforms can be constructed that are superior to similar duration monophasic waveforms and comparable with some dual capacitor biphasic waveforms. The relative magnitude of PI and P 2 appears to be an important determinant of defibrillation efficacy...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of compact size reconfigurable harmonic suppressed antenna {{is crucial in}} today’s wireless communication system. One set of Harmonic Suppressed Antenna (HSA) and its reconfigurable configuration {{in the form of}} fractal dipole antenna that is integrated with the stubs and tapered balun has been designed and tested in this study. The Koch dipoles are double-sided structure while the tapered balun is triangular. Initial design is based on a 0. 9 GHz linear half-wavelength dipole. The Koch dipole antenna has equal arm lengths of 128 mm. These are fabricated on a lossy FR- 4 material. Printed fractal dipole antenna is designed to operate at 670 MHz. This shows that the linear dipole can be miniaturized by employing Koch curve fractals onto the radiating structure. Fifteen bands reconfigurable antenna were designed to operate within 400 MHz to 3. 5 GHz. However, as the frequency of operation is a low microwave band, the antenna physical size is relatively large. Tapered balun thus significantly enlarged the antenna size. In addition, the far field radiation pattern resembles that of a linear dipole. The overall antenna is found to be large and has moderate gain and efficiency. Nevertheless, it can potentially have higher gain and higher efficiency {{with the use of a}} low loss Rogers RT/Duroid material. Thus, the study on the reduction of the tapered balun size is worthwhile. Four sets of wideband tapered baluns with reduced sizes have been designed and tested as a matching circuitry in all the designed antennas. All baluns are found to perform well in terms of scattering parameters and power loss, despite having sizes of 25 %, 50 % and 75 % smaller compared to the original structure. On the other hand, the feeding line method <b>is</b> <b>also</b> investigated. The <b>first</b> <b>design</b> takes into account of 38 � input impedance of the fractal curve while the second design is a direct connection from the 50 � SMA connector to terminal. The latter is then selected as it successfully eliminated the antenna’s higher order modes, while the former is suitable for designing an optimum typical dipole antenna. Both antenna and balun are fabricated on Rogers 4530 B. Four sets of HSA with reduced size have been designed and tested in this study. All sets were based on the 0. 9 GHz linear half-wavelength dipole and have equal arm lengths of 132 mm. These are named as MFDB, MFDB 75, MFDB 50 and MFDB 25. The antennas operate at 691 MHz with low return loss and successfully suppressed their two harmonic frequencies. The MFDB 25 antenna is found to exhibit similar performance in terms of the S-parameters and gain. It <b>is</b> <b>also</b> a compact antenna compared to the corresponding proposed HSA structure while the antenna achieved size reduction close to 19. 7 %, 31. 4 % and 43. 4 %. Hence, four sets of harmonic suppressed reconfigurable antennas named TMFDB, TMDB 75, TMFDB 50 and TMFDB 25 have been designed and simulated. The total numbers of switches are 56, 54, 54, and 50 units respectively. TMFDB 25 antenna is then fabricated and tested. It is found that the antenna has successfully configured 15 frequency bands and simultaneously suppressed higher order modes. The first prototype of an active TMFDB 25 antenna is fabricated to enhance the performance. The suitability of this antenna for space–limited application of future communication system such as cognitive radio has been demonstrated.. The developed antenna can reduce the size of the front-end RF unit, reduce EMI interference and provide another additional characteristic for reconfigurable antenna.
