50|$|On 7 October 1957 {{operators}} of Pile 1 {{noticed that the}} reactor was heating up more than normal, and a <b>Wigner</b> <b>release</b> was ordered. This had been carried out eight times in the past, and it was known that the cycle would cause the entire reactor core to heat up evenly. During this attempt the temperatures anomalously began falling across the reactor core, except in channel 2053, whose temperature was rising. Concluding that 2053 was releasing energy {{but none of the}} others were, on the morning of 8 October {{the decision was made to}} try a second <b>Wigner</b> <b>release.</b> This attempt caused the temperature of the entire reactor to rise, indicating a successful release.|$|E
50|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 10 October it was {{suspected}} that something unusual was going on. The temperature in the core was supposed to gradually fall as <b>Wigner</b> <b>release</b> ended, but the monitoring equipment showed something more ambiguous, and one thermocouple indicated that core temperature was instead rising. As this process continued, the temperature continued to rise and eventually reached 400 °C. In an effort to help cool the pile, the cooling fans were sped up and airflow was increased. Radiation detectors in the chimney then indicated a release, and it was assumed that a cartridge had burst. This was not a fatal problem, and had happened in the past. Unknown to the operators, the cartridge had not just burst, but caught fire, and this was the source of the anomalous heating in channel 2053, not a <b>Wigner</b> <b>release.</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} scientific {{investigation is}} carried out into the effects of ion irradiation on graphite systems. The results obtained have been compared with analogous radiation induced affects seen in neutron irradiated material. Results indicate that ion irradiation causes structural damage of the graphite lattice, as expected, in a very similar way to neutron irradiation. Such damage is also largely recoverable through thermal annealing. However, certain differences are observed and {{it seems likely that}} these are due to differences {{in the nature of the}} damage caused, and the recovery of such damage, on the fundamental level. Ultra-high vacuum (UHV) equipment was used to irradiate samples of nuclear grade graphite and highly-orientated pyrolyitc graphite (HOPG) with inert gas ions and external facilities were also used to irradiate with carbon ions at higher energies. After irradiation a variety of scientific techniques were used to analyse the damage caused as a result of the irradiation. Raman spectroscopy was used extensively to study the samples after irradiation and results indicated the presence of significant ion-induced damage through analysis of the Id/Ig ratio. The results were shown to be analogous to neutron induced damage and the amount of damage present was seen to be dependant on ion mass, ion energy and of course the total ion dose. A broad Raman feature was observed at 1500 cm' 1, after a critical ion dose and such a feature has been rarely observed in neutron irradiated material, this feature perhaps suggests a fundamental difference between the damage occurring and a difference in the type and extent of defects produced. Raman was also used to effectively monitor damage recovery processes occurring as a result of thermal annealing and such recovery was seen to be analogous to the recovery seen in neutron damages materials. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to detect any exothermic release, when heating the sample after irradiation, occurring as a result of a build-up of Wigner-like energy, a phenomenon commonly seen in neutron irradiated graphite. In one case of high energy He+ ion irradiation such an exotherm was observed at 226 °C, the expected temperature range for Wigner-like release, however this result was very difficult to reproduce thus suggesting a fragile balance of ion irradiation parameters resulting in the necessary defects required to observe any <b>Wigner</b> <b>release.</b> Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed clearly that the atomic structure of nuclear grade graphite material was markedly altered as a result of ion irradiation, leading to an amorphous-like structure. These results are in agreement with published TEM work on neutron irradiated material and again highlight a similarity between the two forms of radiation. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was also utilised and samples were analysed before and after irradiation. Contrary to XRD patterns of neutron irradiated graphite, there seemed to be little change in the XRD patterns after irradiation and the expected broadening and peak shift of the peak was not seen, suggesting a difference in the damage caused to the system. Further work is required here to understand why this is the case and again a deeper understanding of the underlying damage mechanisms would be beneficial...|$|E
40|$|The atomic {{processes}} {{associated with}} energy storage and release in irradiated graphite {{have long been}} subject to untested speculation. We examine structures and recombination routes for interstitial-vacancy (I-V) pairs in graphite. Interaction results {{in the formation of}} a new metastable defect (an intimate I-V pair) or a Stone-Wales defect. The intimate I-V pair, although 2. 9 eV more stable than its isolated constituents, still has a formation energy of 10. 8 eV. The barrier to recombination to perfect graphite is calculated to be 1. 3 eV, consistent with the experimental first <b>Wigner</b> energy <b>release</b> peak at 1. 38 eV. We expect similar defects to form in carbon nanostructures such as nanotubes, nested fullerenes, and onions under irradiation...|$|R
40|$|Fiber/matrix {{interfacial}} {{strength is}} known {{to play an important}} role in the mechanical properties of SiCf/SiC composite. The understanding of the deformation mechanism of the fiber/matrix interphase under stress is important in application of SiCf/SiC composite. In the present work, we employ molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the shear strength and structural evolutions of fiber/matrix interphase of SiCf/SiC composite in atomic scale. It is revealed from our computational study that the interphase of graphite-like pyrolytic carbons are the weakest part in the interphase, which determines the interfacial mechanical properties. It is also found that an obvious drop of shear strength occurs at high temperature, owing to the <b>Wigner</b> energy <b>release</b> in the graphite-like carbons. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Models for {{radiation}} damage in graphite are reviewed and compared, {{leading to a}} re-examination of the contribution made by vacancies to annealing processes. A method based on density functional theory, using large supercells with orthorhombic and hexagonal symmetry, is employed to calculate properties and behaviour of lattice vacancies and displacement defects. It is concluded that annihilation of intimate Frenkel defects marks the onset of recovery in electrical resistivity, which occurs when the temperature exceeds about 160 K. Migration of isolated monovacancies is estimated to have an activation energy Ea ≈ 1. 1 eV. Coalescence into divacancy defects occurs in several stages, with different barriers at each stage, depending on the path. The formation of pairs ultimately yields up to 8. 9 eV energy, which is nearly 1. 0 eV more than the formation energy for an isolated monovacancy. Processes resulting in vacancy coalescence and annihilation appear {{to be responsible for}} the main <b>Wigner</b> energy <b>release</b> peak in radiation-damaged graphite, occurring at about 475 K.
