5|$|Arhys informs Daryus that Gabriel {{will be at}} Heaven's Cove {{that night}} ("Moment of Betrayal"). While the meeting time {{approaches}} ("Heaven's Cove"), Faythe decides {{that she wants to}} use the power of her royal status to change the world for good ("Begin Again"). At the amphitheater, Arhys changes his mind on the deal, and when Daryus shows up, they start a fight. Daryus overpowers Arhys and kills him ("The Path That Divides"), unaware that Xander followed them and saw the <b>whole</b> <b>scene.</b> As Xander runs to his father's dead body, Daryus sees the silhouette of someone approaching him. Assuming it to be Gabriel, he attempts to kill him, realising too late that it is actually Faythe ("The Walking Shadow"). Gabriel arrives at the scene and sees his dead brother and the dying Faythe. Covering Xander's ears, he unleashes a scream that causes Daryus to go deaf and that is heard by Nafaryus, Arabelle, and the entire town ("My Last Farewell").|$|E
5|$|Inside {{their hotel}} room, Spears {{and her boyfriend}} start {{screaming}} at each other. When he tries to make amends and get close to her, she brushes off his attempts and walks away. Her boyfriend gets mad and then throws a vase at the wall while Spears goes into the bathroom, hurling something at the mirror. She begins to fill the bathtub and remove her clothes. After this, the video includes intercut scenes of a close-up of Spears singing in a white shirt {{in front of a}} bright white light. As she lies in the bathtub, a red string, a custom associated with Kabbalah is seen in her wrist. She touches her head and looks at her hand, realizing she is bleeding from the wound. According to Jennifer Vineyard of MTV, the blood in her hand is stigmata. She loses consciousness in the bathtub and drowns. Shortly after, her boyfriend finds her and tries to resuscitate her. Meanwhile, it is revealed that in the close-up scenes Spears is actually inside a hospital hallway. The video continues with scenes of her being carried into an ambulance and surrounded by photographers, as well as scenes of her being resuscitated by doctors in a hospital bed. The ghost of Spears in a white shirt, watches herself in the bed and walks into the next room, where a baby girl is born. Spears is then seen running away from the camera into the light. The music video ends with her rising from under the water, resting her head and smiling, suggesting the <b>whole</b> <b>scene</b> of her death was a dream or a morbid fantasy.|$|E
25|$|The {{film was}} {{completed}} using simple {{devices such as}} table fans to rustle the leaves. A few unexpected things happened for the good while shooting the climax scene.

25|$|In Manet’s painting, a barmaid gazes out of frame, {{observed}} by a shadowy male figure. The <b>whole</b> <b>scene</b> {{appears to be}} reflected in the mirror behind the bar, creating a complex web of viewpoints. Wall borrows the internal structure of the painting, and motifs such as the light bulbs that give it spatial depth. The figures are similarly reflected in a mirror, and the woman has the absorbed gaze and posture of Manet’s barmaid, while the man is the artist himself. Though issues of the male gaze, particularly the power relationship between male artist and female model, and the viewer’s role as onlooker, are implicit in Manet’s painting, Wall updates the theme by positioning the camera at the centre of the work, so that it captures the act of making the image (the scene reflected in the mirror) and, at the same time, looks straight out at us.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{theme in the}} decoration, both {{external}} and internal, of any church, is the salvation of humankind by Jesus Christ. The decorative scheme often functions as a Poor Man's Bible, warning the church-goer that, in Biblical terms, the just rewards for his sinful nature is death, and that only through Jesus can forgiveness and redemption be gained. The scheme typically starts outside the church, on the west front, with the portrayal of Christ the Judge above the lintel of the main door. In Romanesque and Gothic buildings, this is usually a sculptural group, and may entail a <b>whole</b> <b>scene</b> of the Last Judgement with details of souls being weighed and rewarded, or dragged down to Hell by demons. In those churches in which painted rather than sculptured decoration prevails, the Last Judgement is often located on {{the interior of the}} west end, rather than the exterior.|$|E
25|$|Looking back, {{the total}} lack of a comic book scene in the early 2000s proved to have a {{cleansing}} effect and pushed many to rebuild the <b>whole</b> <b>scene</b> from its base. The first to act were remaining hardcore fans, who began to organize into web communities on Internet forums and a new scene developed {{on the basis of}} scanlations. Since no comic books were sold on the market, fans began to scan, translate, re-letter and share digital comics. In English speaking countries scanlations usually refer to manga, but in Hungary the process of fan translations and lettering started with Marvel superhero-type comics, and then moved on to other types. The most notable achievement of the Hungarian scanlating scene was that it brought together the fans, forming a base of comics fandom. Although many different websites existed, each specializing in different comics genres, types (European, superhero, independent, manga, underground, etc.), Kepregeny.net managed to unite all different kind of comics fans. Kepregeny.net also started out as a scanlating and scanning website, its forum provided a platform for fans and professionals (artists, editors of earlier series, retailers etc.) to meet and discuss all kinds of issues. Many projects were eventually launched from there, and to this day it is a place for fan talk and professional debate and most notably Kepregeny.net can be regarded as the main information gateway for all comics fans and professionals.|$|E

2500|$|An [...] "Unrated Cut" [...] of AVP:R was {{released}} on DVD that features seven minutes of footage that was cut from the theatrical cut.

500|$|In {{order to}} get the feel of an actual documentary, the {{producers}} hired cinematographer Randall Einhorn, who is known for directing episodes of Survivor, which allowed the show to have the feel of [...] "rough and jumpy" [...] like an actual documentary. According to producer Michael Schur, the producers to the series would follow the documentary format strictly. The producers would have long discussions over whether a scene could work under the documentary format. For example, in the fourth-season episode [...] "Did I Stutter?," [...] a scene featured Michael going through a long process {{to go to the bathroom}} and not pass by Stanley. The producers debated whether that was possible and Einhorn walked through the <b>whole</b> <b>scene</b> in order to see if a camera man could get to all the places in time to shoot the <b>whole</b> <b>scene.</b> Despite the strict nature in the early years of the series, later seasons seem to have loosened the rules on the format, with the camera crew often going into places that actual documentary crews would not, which also changed the writing and comedy-style of the series. This inconsistency has received criticism from critics and fans.|$|E

5000|$|Regarding a later {{release of}} the film in a package with other science fiction features, film {{reviewer}} Glenn Erickson observed that The Giant Behemoth was derivative, speculating [...] "... director Eugène Lourié apparently instructed writers Robert Abel and Alan Adler to repackage his original The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, copying <b>whole</b> <b>scenes</b> and situations.

500|$|Along {{with the}} mass of white seen behind Napoleon, the amber {{sunlight}} glow, originating from the West of Napoleon's troupe, is the central source of lighting in the painting. It introduces contrast when coupled with shadow, and, by illumination, highlights key aspects of the scene; this is particularly seen by the light that falls across Bonaparte's pigeon chest. Napoleon and the mule he is saddled on are richly [...] visually by the contrasting light and shade, as is the guide leading the mule. The ice and snow layers, also, are made whiter by the sunshine from the West, brightening the <b>whole</b> <b>scene.</b> However, the overhanging cliff on the left of Napoleon's guide and {{the legs of the}} mule both cast shadows to balance the lighting scheme of the painting.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, Milligan played {{games with}} the medium itself. <b>Whole</b> <b>scenes</b> were written in which {{characters}} would leave, close the door behind themselves, yet still be inside the room. Further to this, characters would announce their departure, slam a door, {{but it would be}} another character who had left the room.

Dohring felt that his audition for Duncan [...] "was a little dark", and he was told by the producers that it was [...] "not really right". The producers asked Dohring to read {{for the role of}} Logan, which involved reading Duncan's lines. Dohring acted one scene from the pilot, in which he shattered the headlights of a car with a crowbar. During the final auditions, Dohring read two times with Bell and met with the studio and the network. When reading with Bell, Dohring acted the <b>whole</b> <b>scene</b> as if he had raped her, and tried to give the character an evil and fun feel. At the time of Dohring's audition for Logan, the character was only going to be a guest star in the pilot.|$|E
500|$|Comedic actor Will Arnett {{made his}} fifth {{appearance}} as Devon Banks on 30 Rock, after appearing on [...] "Fireworks", [...] "Jack Gets in the Game", [...] "Succession", and [...] "Do-Over". Jon Glaser, a comedy actor, guest starred as Mike, a nametag-wearing employee who grows angry with Liz Lemon after showing her {{a quote from}} her book.

500|$|Ray Harding {{wrote the}} script for [...] "Episode 523". Bruce Andrews from Charles Sturt University noted that {{it is one of}} only a few Neighbours episodes to include the entire cast. The {{producers}} asked Rod Hardy to direct the episode, due to his experience of directing other television weddings. Hardy believed that [...] "the magic of the episode" [...] is captured best in two close-up shots of Scott and Charlene. The director recalled [...] "The image that stays with me is the close-up of Kylie as she arrives and then the close-up on Jason's face, and those two looks epitomised what the <b>whole</b> <b>scene</b> was about." [...] The episode was shot [...] "in great secrecy" [...] three months before it was broadcast on Australian television. The shoot was initially delayed due to bad weather. Due to a limited budget, there were very few extras on set and crew were asked to stand in at the church instead. The scenes were shot in soft focus, creating [...] "a halo effect" [...] around Charlene as she walked up the aisle.|$|E
500|$|During filming, Cameron {{made use}} of his virtual camera system, {{a new way of}} {{directing}} motion-capture filmmaking. The system shows the actors' virtual counterparts in their digital surroundings in real time, allowing the director to adjust and direct scenes just as if shooting live action. According to Cameron, [...] "It's like a big, powerful game engine. If I want to fly through space, or change my perspective, I can. I can turn the <b>whole</b> <b>scene</b> into a living miniature and go through it on a 50 to 1 scale." [...] Using conventional techniques, the complete virtual world cannot be seen until the motion-capture of the actors is complete. Cameron said this process does not diminish the value or importance of acting. On the contrary, because {{there is no need for}} repeated camera and lighting setups, costume fittings and make-up touch-ups, scenes do not need to be interrupted repeatedly. Cameron described the system as a [...] "form of pure creation where if you want to move a tree or a mountain or the sky or change the time of day, you have complete control over the elements".|$|E
5|$|Ottman {{said the}} {{challenge}} on Valkyrie {{was to create}} tension from dialogue scenes, and he often reshaped scenes to do this: moments rather than <b>whole</b> <b>scenes</b> were cut from the film. Being historically accurate meant Ottman was more restricted in reorganizing scenes, but {{he was able to}} choose what lines and close-ups he could focus on. Ottman said the scene he was most saddened to delete was a scene where von Stauffenberg dances with his wife because he had been looking forward to scoring it.|$|R
5000|$|Videotape editing of {{the period}} was very primitive, which forced Electronovision {{producers}} to approach their productions essentially {{as if they were}} live TV broadcasts. <b>Whole</b> <b>scenes</b> were shot in long blocks, typically at least 5 or 10 minutes, and segments were physically cut together using mechanical 2" [...] videotape splicing blocks. A special chemical solution and magnetic powder, applied to the videotape and viewed under a microscope, allowed the editor to see the video pulses and precisely align them for glitch-free editing. However, the technique was hit-and-miss and made it difficult to make accurate, fast edits.|$|R
