Imperial Valley farmers, under {{considerable}} financial stress, pressured the California Development Company {{to resolve the}} problem. Charles Rockwood, faced with bankruptcy and [...] "after mature deliberation", directed the engineering of a breach in {{the bank of the}} Colorado River approximately 4 mi south of the existing wooden headgates (the Chaffey Gate).|$|E

Since an accident could occur anywhere on or off airport property, sufficient water and other agents must be carried to contain the fire {{to allow for the}} best possibility of extinguishment, maximum possibility for evacuation and/or until additional resources arrive on the scene.|$|E
40|$|Vegetation {{restoration}} {{is helpful}} in preventing soil erosion but aggravates water scarcity, thus resulting in soil desiccation on the wind-water erosion crisscross region (WWECR) of the Loess Plateau in Northwestern China. However, no guideline currently {{exists on the}} selection of plant species and density for restoration purposes. Based on the process model of soil <b>water-carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> for vegetation (SWCCV) originally developed in this region, this study validated the model under {{a broad range of}} weather regimes, soil types, and land uses. The SWCCV model was applied as a diagnostic tool to obtain insights into the separate effects of vegetation density and land use on soil water dynamics on the WWECR of the Loess Plateau. Results showed that the total water loss at semi-natural grasslands was close to rainfall while significantly decreasing runoffs, thus indicating that semi-natural grass was suitable for vegetation restoration on the WWECR. If Caragana korshinskii is planted for agronomic and economic benefits, a density of 3, 400 trees ha(- 1) will yield the most optimal soil water conservation benefits at study site. Our recommended land use and vegetation density were directive and instructional for vegetation restoration on the WWECR and that our modeling approach could be extended to applications in other arid and semi-arid regions...|$|E
40|$|The {{conception}} of an area's carrying capacity {{has proven to}} be a useful concept at various scales ranging from populations to the entire biosphere, and it appears to be a suitable definition for any level. For soil <b>water-carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> for vegetation (SWCCV), the concept evokes density-dependence research in arid and semi-arid regions. The term is increasingly being used among ecological disciplines but remains vague and elusive. We propose the following definition: the SWCCV is 'the maximum biomass of a given type of vegetation, under specific climatic conditions, soil texture, and management regime, that a given arid or semi-arid area can sustain without diminishing the capacity of soil water to support future generations. Models for assessing the SWCCV of an area of interest, though preliminary, can be classified into three types according to their construction: empirical, conceptual, and process models. Neither the empirical model nor the conceptual model can account for the dynamic interactions between soil water and vegetation for heterogeneous environmental matrices in arid and semi-arid regions. The physically based process model would enable us to effectively analyse and simulate the components of the SWCCV. While water cycle and photosynthesis are not properly integrated in such quantitative models, the effects of water stress on transpiration, carbon-assimilation rates, and its feedback into the water cycle are not generally represented. From our point of view, hydrological and biogeochemical cycles need to be modelled in detail and simultaneously, while considering feedbacks between vegetation growth and soil hydrological processes...|$|E
40|$|The {{deterioration}} of pipes in urban water distribution systems {{is of concern}} to water utilities throughout the world. This deterioration generally leads to pipe breaks and leaks, which may result in reduction in the <b>water-carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of the pipes from tuberculation of interior walls of the pipe. Deterioration {{can also lead to}} contamination of water in the distribution systems. Water utilities which are already facing tight funding constraints incur large expenses in replacement and rehabilitation of water mains, and hence it becomes critical to evaluate the current and future condition of the system for making maintenance decisions. Quantitative estimates of the likelihood of pipe breaks on individual pipe segments can facilitate inspection and maintenance decisions. A number of statistical methods have been proposed for this estimation problem. This thesis focuses on comparing these statistical models on the basis of short time histories. The goals of this research are to estimate the likelihood of pipe breaks in the future and to determine the parameters that most affect the likelihood of pipe breaks. The various statistical models reviewed in this thesis are time linear and time exponential ordinary least squares regression models, proportional hazards models (PHM), and generalized linear models (GLM). The data set used for the analysis comes from a major U. S. city, and the data includes approximately 85, 000 pipe segments with nearly 2, 500 breaks from 2000 through 2005. The covariates used in the analysis are pipe diameter, length, material, year of installation, operating pressure, rainfall, land use, soil type, soil corrosivity, soil moisture, and temperature. The Logistic Generalized Linear Model fits can be used by water utilities to choose inspection regimes based on a rigorous estimation of pipe breakage risk in their pipe network...|$|E
