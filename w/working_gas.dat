25|$|When {{one side}} of the piston is open to the atmosphere, the {{operation}} is slightly different. As the sealed volume of <b>working</b> <b>gas</b> comes in contact with the hot side, it expands, doing work on both the piston and on the atmosphere. When the <b>working</b> <b>gas</b> contacts the cold side, its pressure drops below atmospheric pressure and the atmosphere pushes on the piston and does work on the gas.|$|E
25|$|The {{displacer}} is a special-purpose piston, used in Beta and Gamma type Stirling engines, to {{move the}} <b>working</b> <b>gas</b> {{back and forth between}} the hot and cold heat exchangers. Depending on the type of engine design, the displacer may or may not be sealed to the cylinder, i.e. it may be a loose fit within the cylinder, allowing the <b>working</b> <b>gas</b> to pass around it as it moves to occupy the part of the cylinder beyond.|$|E

The aim of this investigation is to determine the influence of different <b>working</b> <b>gases</b> on deposition rate and optical SiO 2 -nanostructure properties. We use Ar, Xe and Kr, as <b>working</b> <b>gases</b> to obtain different deposition rate. We observed a maximum deposition rate for Argon and a minimum deposition rate for Xenon.

Monte-Carlo method is used to investigate the spatial resolution determined by the transverse diffusion in the device. The simulation results indicate that the electrical parameters, such as the GEM voltages and the electric field at the drift and induction regions, only have minor effects on the spatial resolution. The geometrical parameters and the <b>working</b> <b>gases</b> chosen, on the other hand, are the main parameters that determine the spatial resolution. The spatial {{resolution is}} determined more on the drift and diffusion processes than on the avalanche process. Especially for the different <b>working</b> <b>gases,</b> the square root function of the ratio of the electron diffusion coefficient and the mobility has a significant effect on the spatial resolution.

Three different cathode materials, namely fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), aluminum oxide coated FTO (Al 2 O 3 /FTO) and magnesium oxide coated FTO (MgO/FTO) were prepared to investigate how the variations of γ and <b>working</b> <b>gases</b> influence the performance of FEEL devices, especially in lowering the breakdown voltage and pressure of the <b>working</b> <b>gases.</b> The {{results indicate that the}} MgO/FTO bilayer cathode exhibited a relatively larger effective secondary electron emission coefficient, resulting in significant reduction of breakdown voltage to about 3 kV and allowing the device to be operated at the lower pressure to generate the higher lighting efficiency...|$|R

25|$|A beta Stirling has {{a single}} power piston {{arranged}} within the same cylinder on the same shaft as a displacer piston. The displacer piston is a loose fit and does not extract any power from the expanding gas but only serves to shuttle the <b>working</b> <b>gas</b> between the hot and cold heat exchangers. When the <b>working</b> <b>gas</b> is pushed to the hot end of the cylinder it expands and pushes the power piston. When it is pushed to the cold end of the cylinder it contracts and {{the momentum of the}} machine, usually enhanced by a flywheel, pushes the power piston the other way to compress the gas. Unlike the alpha type, the beta type avoids the technical problems of hot moving seals, as the power piston is not in contact with the hot gas.|$|E
25|$|The {{engine is}} {{designed}} so the <b>working</b> <b>gas</b> is generally compressed in the colder {{portion of the}} engine and expanded in the hotter portion resulting in a net conversion of heat into work.

25|$|A simple {{centrifugal}} compressor has four components: inlet, impeller/rotor, diffuser, and collector. Figure 3.1 shows {{each of the}} components of the flow path, with the flow (<b>working</b> <b>gas)</b> entering the centrifugal impeller axially from right to left. As a result of the impeller rotating clockwise when looking downstream into the compressor, the flow will pass through the volute's discharge cone moving away from the figure's viewer.|$|E
25|$|The key {{component}} {{that makes a}} compressor centrifugal is the centrifugal impeller, Figure 0.1, which contains a rotating set of vanes (or blades) that gradually raises {{the energy of the}} <b>working</b> <b>gas.</b> This is identical to an axial compressor with the exception that the gases can reach higher velocities and energy levels through the impeller's increasing radius. In many modern high-efficiency centrifugal compressors the gas exiting the impeller is traveling near the speed of sound.|$|E

25|$|The {{deregulation}} {{activity in}} the underground gas storage arena has attracted independent storage service providers to develop storage facilities. The capacity made available would then be leased to third-party customers such as marketers and electricity generators. It is expected that in the future, this group would take more market share, as more deregulation takes place. Currently in the US, this group accounts for 18 percent of overall storage deliverability and 13 percent of <b>working</b> <b>gas</b> capacity in the US.|$|E
25|$|Thermoacoustic {{devices are}} very {{different}} from Stirling devices, although the individual path travelled by each <b>working</b> <b>gas</b> molecule does follow a real Stirling cycle. These devices include the thermoacoustic engine and thermoacoustic refrigerator. High-amplitude acoustic standing waves cause compression and expansion analogous to a Stirling power piston, while out-of-phase acoustic travelling waves cause displacement along a temperature gradient, analogous to a Stirling displacer piston. Thus a thermoacoustic device typically does not have a displacer, as found in a beta or gamma Stirling.|$|E
