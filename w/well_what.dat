25|$|This {{explanation}} of Ubay {{also makes it}} very clear that the Companions did not differ at all about what was part of the Quran and what {{was not part of the}} Quran when the revelation had ceased. It is also important to note that the hadith appeared in the mushaf of Ubay because it was for his own personal use, in other words, his private notebook, where he did not always distinguish between Quranic material and hadith, since it was not meant for general use and he himself knew <b>well</b> <b>what</b> to make of his own notes. The same is true of the other copies of the Quran, which some of the Companions had for their own personal use.|$|E

25|$|The SAG {{standardization}} efforts {{presented an}} opportunity for Microsoft to adapt their Jet system to the new CLI standard. This would not only make Windows a premier platform for CLI development, but also allow users to use SQL to access both Jet and other databases as <b>well.</b> <b>What</b> was missing was the SQL parser that could convert those calls from their text form into the C-interface used in Jet. To solve this, MS partnered with PageAhead Software to use their existing query processor, SIMBA. SIMBA {{was used as a}} parser above Jet's C library, turning Jet into an SQL database. And because Jet could forward those C-based calls to other databases, this also allowed SIMBA to query other systems. Microsoft included drivers for Excel to turn its spreadsheet documents into SQL-accessible database tables.|$|E
25|$|In 1988 several vendors, {{mostly from}} the Unix and {{database}} communities, formed the SQL Access Group (SAG) {{in an effort to}} produce a single basic standard for the SQL language. At the first meeting there was considerable debate over whether or not the effort should work solely on the SQL language itself, or attempt a wider standardization which included a dynamic SQL language-embedding system as <b>well,</b> <b>what</b> they called a Call Level Interface (CLI). While attending the meeting with an early draft of what was then still known as MS Data Access, Kyle Geiger of Microsoft invited Jeff Balboni and Larry Barnes of Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) to join the SQLC meetings as well. SQLC was a potential solution to the call for the CLI, which was being led by DEC.|$|E
25|$|One {{day during}} our lunch {{hour in the}} last week of filming, the craft service man handed out slices of {{watermelon}} to each of us. Richard, the whole camera crew, and I sat together in a big sound studio eating a number of watermelon slices, talking and joking. As a gag, some members of the crew used a piece of watermelon as a Frisbee, and tossed it back and forth to each other. One piece of watermelon landed at Richard's feet. He got up and went home. Filming stopped. The next day, Richard announced that he knew very <b>well</b> <b>what</b> the significance of watermelon was. He said that he was quitting show business and would not return to this film. The day after that, Richard walked in, all smiles. I wasn't privy to all the negotiations that went on between Columbia and Richard's lawyers, but the camera operator who had thrown that errant piece of watermelon had been fired that day. I assume now that Richard was using drugs during Stir Crazy.|$|E

500|$|In their {{accounts}} afterward, British officers and soldiers alike noted their frustration that the colonial militiamen fired {{at them from}} behind trees and stone walls, rather than confronting them in large, linear formations {{in the style of}} European warfare. [...] This image of the individual colonial farmer, musket in hand and fighting under his own command, has also been fostered in American myth: [...] "Chasing the red-coats down the lane / Then crossing the fields to emerge again / Under the trees {{at the turn of the}} road, / And only pausing to fire and load." [...] To the contrary, beginning at the North Bridge and throughout the British retreat, the colonial militias repeatedly operated as coordinated companies, even when dispersed to take advantage of cover. [...] Reflecting on the British experience that day, Earl Percy understood the significance of the American tactics: During the whole affair the Rebels attacked us in a very scattered, irregular manner, but with perseverance & resolution, nor did they ever dare to form into any regular body. Indeed, they knew too <b>well</b> <b>what</b> was proper, to do so. Whoever looks upon them as an irregular mob, will find himself much mistaken. They have men amongst them who know very <b>well</b> <b>what</b> they are about, having been employed as Rangers against the Indians & Canadians, & this country being much covered with wood, and hilly, is very advantageous for their method of fighting.|$|E

500|$|Unlike in a {{traditional}} film soundtrack, Moore often wrote music [...] "not necessarily to always match the images on the screen, but to sometimes play against it." [...] Moore explained that {{a traditional}} soundtrack needs to convey {{the mood of the}} scene and advance the film's storyline, but {{that he did not have}} to do that with Graveyard Mountain Home [...] "because the director's not around". [...] "I thought, <b>well</b> <b>what</b> would it be like if I did a totally different kind of mood than this scene is trying to convey? When you put that music with that scene what happens there? Sometimes it's kind of interesting what happens," [...] Moore explained.|$|E
500|$|At the 1994 Anime America convention, Nagai {{talked about}} the {{contrast}} between Honey and the dark Cosplay City: [...] "I thought... <b>well,</b> <b>what</b> would Honey-chan do if she appeared in a dark futuristic city like in BATMAN. In the movie BATMAN, everything is dark. Dark background and dark characters. However, {{in the case of}} Honey-chan, she’s super cheerful and sunny. She really stands out due to the dark background." [...] He believed that New Cutie Honey differed from other anime that focus on settings and characters' expositions, and that Honey instead [...] "makes her own moves, and she carries the whole story". On the relative weakness of male characters in the series, he said, [...] "Honey-chan is like a mother, and she loves to protect weak men. Their existence is her reason to live, like oh, 'I have to fight to protect you.|$|E
500|$|Bacon did {{not seek}} to {{illustrate}} the narrative of the tale, however. He told the French art critic Michel Leiris, [...] "I could not paint Agamemnon, Clytemnestra or Cassandra, as {{that would have been}} merely another kind of historical painting... Therefore I tried to create an image of the effect it produced inside me." [...] Aeschylus' phrase [...] "the reek of human blood smiles out at me" [...] in particular haunted Bacon, and his treatments of the mouth in the triptych and many subsequent paintings were attempts to visualise the sentiment. In 1985, he observed that Aeschylus' phrase brought up in him [...] "the most exciting images, and I often read it... the violence of it brings up the images in me, 'the reek of human blood smiles out at me', <b>well</b> <b>what</b> could be more amazing than that." ...|$|E

500|$|During his youth, Starr {{had been}} a devoted fan of skiffle and blues music, {{but by the time}} he joined the Texans in 1958, he had {{developed}} a preference for rock and roll. He was also influenced by country artists, including Hank Williams, Buck Owens and Hank Snow, and jazz artists such as Chico Hamilton and Yusef Lateef, whose compositional style inspired Starr's fluid and energetic drum fills and grooves. While reflecting on Buddy Rich, Starr commented: [...] "He does things with one hand that I can't do with nine, but that's technique. Everyone I talk to says 'What about Buddy Rich?' <b>Well,</b> <b>what</b> about him? Because he doesn't turn me on." [...] He stated that he [...] "was never really into drummers", but identified Cozy Cole 1958 cover of Benny Goodman [...] "Topsy Part Two" [...] as [...] "the one drum record" [...] he bought.|$|E
500|$|<b>Well,</b> <b>what</b> {{happened}} there is, of course—now {{all of you}} must adjust your brains—the biggest work of art there has ever been.

[...] And that is the greatest work of art that exists for the whole Cosmos. Just imagine what {{happened there}}. There {{are people who are}} so concentrated on this single performance, and then five thousand people are driven to Resurrection. In one moment. I couldn't do that. Compared to that, we are nothing, as composers. [...] It is a crime, you know of course, because the people did not agree to it. They did not come to the [...] "concert". That is obvious. And nobody had told them: [...] "You could be killed in the process." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Girl Gone Wild" [...] was {{recorded}} at MSR Studios, New York City and Sarm West Studios, Notting Hill, London. It {{was written by}} Madonna, Vaughan and the Benassi Bros., and was produced by the Benassis and Madonna. Demacio [...] "Demo" [...] Castellon recorded and mixed the track. Philippe Weiss and Graham Archer assisted Castellon on the recording, while Angie Teo assisted on the mixing. Stephen [...] "The Koz" [...] Kozmeniuk did the additional editing of the song and arranged the vocoder. Benny Benassi recalled that Madonna would arrive in the studio around 3–4 pm and would work till 11:30 pm in the night. Together they fixed {{the production of the}} song, including the layering and stacking of the track. They added more vocals to the composition and during the chorus, decided on how many voices should be duplicated. According to Alle Benassi, Madonna [...] "has clear idea. She knows very <b>well</b> <b>what</b> she wants: where put something, how, why. It's surreal but impressive." ...|$|E

500|$|Apart {{from sexual}} themes, Miguel wrote about {{conversational}} and existential topics. When writing [...] "Pussy Is Mine", he drew on his sexual {{behavior as a}} single man and [...] "moments of power and vulnerability" [...] with a sexually promiscuous woman. Miguel originally wrote [...] "Where's the Fun in Forever" [...] with Alicia Keys for her 2012 album Girl on Fire at a recording studio in Jamaica. He conceived the song while spending time with Keys {{on the roof of}} the studio, which he recounted in an interview for MTV News: [...] "ll I had was this amazing blanket of stars in the sky and the sound of waves in the distance, great vibe ... So here I am trying to be creative for Alicia and it just dawned on me: <b>Well,</b> <b>what</b> if we did live forever? Could we have accomplished all of these amazing things? Would we have come so far? ... Would we have come up with all these theories or built all of these amazing, amazing architectural beautiful things ... or would we have been lazy?" [...] The album's title track was written by Miguel while he was working on All I Want Is You. In reaction to Jive's request for more conventional R songs, he composed the song with unusual lyrics and without a hook, chorus, or form.|$|E
500|$|A few mounted militiamen on {{the road}} would dismount, fire muskets at the {{approaching}} regulars, then remount and gallop ahead to repeat the tactic. [...] Unmounted militia would often fire from long range, {{in the hope of}} hitting somebody in the main column of soldiers {{on the road}} and surviving, since both British and colonials used muskets with an effective combat range of about [...] [...] Infantry units would apply pressure to the sides of the British column. [...] When it moved out of range, those units would move around and forward to re-engage the column further down the road. [...] Heath sent messengers out to intercept arriving militia units, directing them to appropriate places along the road to engage the regulars. [...] Some towns sent supply wagons to assist in feeding and rearming the militia. [...] Heath and Warren did lead skirmishers in small actions into battle themselves, but it was the presence of effective leadership that probably had the greatest impact on the success of these tactics. [...] Percy wrote of the colonial tactics, [...] "The rebels attacked us in a very scattered, irregular manner, but with perseverance and resolution, nor did they ever dare to form into any regular body. [...] Indeed, they knew too <b>well</b> <b>what</b> was proper, to do so. [...] Whoever looks upon them as an irregular mob, will find himself very much mistaken." ...|$|E
500|$|In Greek {{the gesture}} {{was known as}} the katapygon (κατάπυγον, from kata – κατά, [...] "downwards" [...] and pugē – πυγή, [...] "rump, buttocks"). In ancient Greek comedy, the finger was a gesture of insult toward another person, with the term katapugon also {{referring}} to [...] "a male who submits to anal penetration" [...] or katapygaina to a female. In Aristophanes's comedy The Clouds (423 BC), when the character Socrates is quizzing his student on poetic meters, Strepsiades declares that he knows quite <b>well</b> <b>what</b> a dactyl is, and gives the finger. The gesture is a visual pun on the two meanings of the Greek word dactylos, both [...] "finger" [...] and the rhythmic measure composed of a long syllable and two short, like the joints of a finger ( [...] which also appears as a visual pun on the penis and testicles in a medieval Latin text). Socrates reacts to the gesture as boorish and childish. The gesture recurs as a form of mockery in Peace, alongside farting in someone's face; the usage is later explained in the Suda and included in the Adagia of Erasmus. The verb [...] "to play the Siphnian" [...] appears in a fragment of Aristophanes and has a similar meaning; the usage is once again explained in the Suda, where it is said to mean [...] "to touch the anus with a finger". Diogenes Laërtius records how the Cynic philosopher Diogenes of Sinope directed the gesture at the orator Demosthenes in 4th-century BC Athens. In the Discourses of Epictetus, Diogenes's target is instead one of the sophists.|$|E
