Whitting {{has only one}} way for Reed {{to make contact with}} Leeland; his step-sister, Vivian (Jennifer Chu) {{recently}} ran away, and Shen has been unable to find her. Witting tells Reed where she is, and Reed returns her to Leeland, pretending he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> a deal for The King to distribute Leeland's merchandise in Harlem. Leeland puts Reed in contact with Lin (James Hong), who handles local distribution. However, Leeland discovers Reed is an undercover cop and orders Lin to kill him. Reed survives, and heads to Leeland's headquarters, where Leeland tells him he doesn't know who the mole is, but he does know a bribe is set to be picked up at a locker in Grand Central Station.|$|E

He also stated that every Romanian pays Ponta's campaign from the taxes and dues he introduced. During the same meeting, Iohannis refuted all rumors regarding his intentions to cut the pensions after the election, after many pensioners received flyers in the mail, with messages such as [...] "Only Ponta protects the pensions" [...] and [...] "Klaus Iohannis <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> your pension" [...] written on them. In a press release, ACL accused PSD that it engages in a campaign against Klaus Iohannis by misinforming and deceiving voters. The Romanian Post signed contracts with PSD, but also with PMP, Macovei and Tăriceanu, agreeing to send newspapers, catalogs, leaflets, brochures and other electoral advertising materials to homes around the country. Over 4 million anti-Iohannis flyers were distributed by the Romanian Post, totaling up to 50,000 euros.|$|E

Well, I'm sure that's very refreshing; for down here we're all as dull as sticks together; Tories, every one of us to a man; perfect unanimity; no differences of opinion; all as conventional and proper as the vicar's sermons. Now, to have somebody who <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> your head off, in the house, is really delightful. I love originality. Not that I've ever seen anybody original in all my life, for I haven't, but I'm sure it would be delightful if I did. One reads about original people in novels, you know, Dickens and that sort of thing; and I often think I should like to meet some of them (good stroke again; legs, legs, legs, if you please--no, it hasn't legs enough); but here, or for the matter of that, in town either, we never see anybody but the same eternal round of Algies, and Monties, and Berties, and Hughs--all very nice young men, no doubt; exceedingly proper, nothing against them; good shots, capital partners, excellent families, everything on earth that anybody could desire, except a single atom of personal originality. I assure you, if they were all shaken up in a bag together and well mixed, in evening clothes (so as not to tell them apart by the tweeds, you know), their own mothers wouldn't be able to separate them afterwards. But if you don't shoot and don't play billiards, I'm sure I don't know what you'll ever find to do with yourself here at Dunbude.' ...|$|E

[...] Sometimes he joins them {{for a day or}} two [...] And sees old friends he somehow can't get near.

[...] I blamed it on the hot spell we've been having. [...] 'Twas nothing but my foolish hanging back, [...] Not liking to own up I'd grown a size. [...] Number eighteen this is. What size do you wear?" [...] The Doctor caught his throat convulsively. [...] "Oh--ah--fourteen--fourteen." [...] "Fourteen! You say so! [...] I can remember when I wore fourteen. [...] And come to think I must have back at home [...] More than a hundred collars, size fourteen. [...] Too bad to waste them all. You ought to have them.

[...] The Doctor made a subdued dash for it, [...] And propped himself at bay against a pillow. [...] "Not that way, with your shoes on Kike's white bed. [...] You can't rest that way. Let me pull your shoes off." [...] "Don't touch me, please--I say, don't touch me, please. [...] I'll not be put to bed by you, my man." [...] "Just as you say. Have it your own way then.

[...] "You drive around? It must be pleasant work." [...] "It's business, but I can't say it's not fun. [...] What I like best's the lay of different farms, [...] Coming out on them from a stretch of woods, [...] Or over a hill or round a sudden corner. [...] I like to find folks getting out in spring, [...] Raking the dooryard, working near the house. [...] Later they get out further in the fields. [...] Everything's shut sometimes except the barn; [...] The family's all away in some back meadow. [...] There's a hay load a-coming--when it comes. [...] And later still they all get driven in: [...] The fields are stripped to lawn, the garden patches [...] Stripped to bare ground, the apple trees [...] To whips and poles. There's nobody about. [...] The chimney, though, keeps up a good brisk smoking. [...] And I lie back and ride. I take the reins [...] Only when someone's coming, and the mare [...] Stops when she likes: I tell her when to go. [...] I've spoiled Jemima in more ways than one. [...] She's got so she turns in at every house [...] As if she had some sort of curvature, [...] No matter if I have no errand there. [...] She thinks I'm sociable. I maybe am. [...] It's seldom I get down except for meals, though. [...] Folks entertain me from the kitchen doorstep, [...] All in a family row down to the youngest." [...] "One would suppose they might not be as glad [...] To see you as you are to see them." [...] "Oh, [...] Because I want their dollar. I don't want [...] Anything they've not got. I never dun. [...] I'm there, and they can pay me if they like. [...] I go nowhere on purpose: I happen by. [...] Sorry there is no cup to give you a drink. [...] I drink out of the bottle--not your style. [...] Mayn't I offer you----?" [...] "No, no, no, thank you." [...] "Just as you say. Here's looking at you then.-- [...] And now I'm leaving you a little while. [...] You'll rest easier when I'm gone, perhaps-- [...] Lie down--let yourself go and get some sleep. [...] But first--let's see--what was I going to ask you? [...] Those collars--who shall I address them to, [...] Suppose you aren't awake when I come back?" [...] "Really, friend, I can't let you. You--may need them." [...] "Not till I shrink, when they'll be out of style." [...] "But really I--I have so many collars." [...] "I don't know who I rather would have have them. [...] They're only turning yellow where they are. [...] But you're the doctor as the saying is. [...] I'll put the light out. Don't you wait for me: [...] I've just begun the night. You get some sleep. [...] I'll knock so-fashion and peep round the door [...] When I come back so you'll know who it is. [...] There's nothing I'm afraid of like scared people. [...] I don't want you should shoot me in the head. [...] What am I doing carrying off this bottle? [...] There now, you get some sleep." [...] He shut the door.
