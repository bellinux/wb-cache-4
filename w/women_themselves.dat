Many of the authors were <b>women</b> <b>themselves,</b> such as Gale Wilhelm and Ann Bannon. Many male homosexuals also enjoyed gay pulp fiction, which borrowed the same sexploitation format as the lesbian books.|$|E

If no less than 300,000 of them were to affirmatively vote in favor of the grant within two years, it would be deemed granted the country's women. Complying with this mandate, the government ordered a plebiscite to be held for the purpose on April 3, 1937.|$|E

25|$|Joseon {{was founded}} on Korean Confucianism, and these {{scholars}} of the time took a very dim view of professional women and of the kisaeng class in particular. There were many calls for {{the abolition of the}} kisaeng, or for their exclusion from court, but these were not successful—perhaps because of the influence of the <b>women</b> <b>themselves,</b> or perhaps because of fear that officials would take to stealing the wives of other men. One such proposal was made during the reign of Sejong the Great, but when an advisor of the court suggested that the abolition of the class would lead to government officials committing grave crimes, the king chose to preserve the kisaeng.|$|E
25|$|Traditional anlu, {{similar to}} fombuen or keluh in Kedjom Keku {{communities}} and ndofoumbgui in the Aghem tribe, involves {{groups of women}} organizing and shaming individuals who violate certain moral rules. The ostracizing could develop {{as a result of}} any set of offenses that violated community morality and were believed to threaten the life of the community (by damaging fertility, food, or prosperity). These offenses could include insulting one's mother, physically abusing a pregnant or nursing woman, committing incest, or other offenses. The women would respond with actions considered outside of the communities moral order (vulgar speech, display of genitals, dress in men's clothing, defecation on the offender's property, etc.) in order to highlight the egregiousness of the offense and pressure for repayment. The <b>women</b> <b>themselves</b> are organized under the leadership of the oldest woman of the community, named the na-anlu.|$|E
25|$|Women's {{suffrage}} {{was achieved}} in 1920, and early 20th century antifeminism was primarily focused on fighting this. Suffragists scoffed at antisuffragists. Anna Howard Shaw, {{president of the}} National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) from 1904 to 1915, presumed, perhaps unfairly, that the antisuffragists were merely working {{under the influence of}} male forces. Later historians tended to dismiss antisuffragists as subscribing to the model of domestic idealism, that a woman's place is in the home. This undermines and belittles the true power and numbers behind the antisuffrage movement, which was primarily led by <b>women</b> <b>themselves.</b> Arguments employed by antisuffragists {{at the turn of the}} century had less to do with a woman's place in the home as much as it had to do with a woman's proper place in the public realm. In fact, leaders of the movement often encouraged other women to leave the home and participate in society. What they opposed was women participating in the political sphere.|$|E

25|$|The Iranian Revolution was a gendered revolution; {{much of the}} new regime’s rhetoric was {{centered}} on the position of women in Iranian society. Beyond rhetoric, thousands of women were also heavily mobilized in the revolution itself, and different groups of women actively participated alongside their male counterparts. Not only participating through voting, women contributed to the revolution through marches, demonstrations and chanting slogans. The revolution was non-violent in nature which facilitated women’s involvement within it. For example, women were involved in caring for the wounded, female doctors responding to calls for help and opening their homes for those who needed assistance. While <b>women</b> <b>themselves</b> were often killed, tortured, arrested or injured and some were involved in guerilla activities, most contributed in non-violent ways. Many women were instrumental not only in being involved in the revolution themselves but in mobilizing men and other non-political women. Many women protested while carrying children and their presence {{was one of the main}} reasons for disarming soldiers (who were there on behalf of the regime) who were ordered to shoot if necessary.|$|E
25|$|Upper Paleolithic humans {{produced}} {{works of}} art such as cave paintings, Venus figurines, animal carvings, and rock paintings. Upper Paleolithic art {{can be divided into}} two broad categories: figurative art such as cave paintings that clearly depicts animals (or more rarely humans); and nonfigurative, which consists of shapes and symbols. Cave paintings have been interpreted {{in a number of ways}} by modern archaeologists. The earliest explanation, by the prehistorian Abbe Breuil, interpreted the paintings as a form of magic designed to ensure a successful hunt. However, this hypothesis fails to explain the existence of animals such as saber-toothed cats and lions, which were not hunted for food, and the existence of half-human, half-animal beings in cave paintings. The anthropologist David Lewis-Williams has suggested that Paleolithic cave paintings were indications of shamanistic practices, because the paintings of half-human, half-animal paintings and the remoteness of the caves are reminiscent of modern hunter-gatherer shamanistic practices. Symbol-like images are more common in Paleolithic cave paintings than are depictions of animals or humans, and unique symbolic patterns might have been trademarks that represent different Upper Paleolithic ethnic groups. Venus figurines have evoked similar controversy. Archaeologists and anthropologists have described the figurines as representations of goddesses, pornographic imagery, apotropaic amulets used for sympathetic magic, and even as self-portraits of <b>women</b> <b>themselves.</b>|$|E
25|$|Patriarchal {{values are}} deeply {{embedded}} in the society of Pakistan, and its different manifestations are observed in {{different aspects of the}} society. As mentioned above, gender division of labour enforces women to primarily specialize in unpaid care work as mothers and wives at home, whereas men perform paid work, and come out as breadwinners. This has led to a low level of resource investment in girls' education not only by their families but also by the state. This low investment in women's human capital, compounded by negative social biases and cultural practices, restrictions on women's mobility and the internalization of patriarchy by <b>women</b> <b>themselves,</b> becomes the basis for gender discrimination and disparities in most spheres of life. Some of the ramifications are that women are unable to develop job-market skills, hence, they have limited opportunities available to them in the wage-labour market. Moreover, social and cultural restrictions limit women's chances to compete for resources in a world outside the four walls of their homes. It translates into social and economic dependency of women on men. The nature and degree of women's oppression and subordination vary across classes, regions and the rural and urban divide in Pakistan. It has been observed that male dominant structures are relatively more marked in the rural and tribal setting where local customs and indigenous laws establish stronger male authority and power over women.|$|E

500|$|In {{a section}} {{apparently}} reprinted from earlier publications, the pamphlet discerns [...] "Reasons for the Growth of Sodomy" [...] {{in a number}} of aspects of British culture. It claims that, in past ages, British middle-class gentlemen had led moral, industrious lives, serving King, country, and family. This era, the pamphlet claims, was now past and lost; the constitution of the gentleman has deteriorated. Contemporary infants, it says, faced grim prospects, being pampered in nurseries by mothers who dominated their weak fathers. Such children, the pamphlet argued, could not help but to grow up effete and were [...] "scarcely worth raising". Some of the blame for this, the pamphlet claims, lay with the increasing popularity of raising children at home, and having them educated by women, rather than sending them to school or to be apprenticed. Lacking the boisterous companionship of other boys they could not acquire manly traits; governed by women, they never learned to dominate <b>women</b> <b>themselves,</b> which, the pamphlet claimed, was requisite to please a wife.|$|E
500|$|Efforts {{in support}} of the {{ordination}} of women to the priesthood led to several rulings by the Roman Curia or Popes against the proposal, as in Declaration on the Question of the Admission of Women to the Ministerial Priesthood (1976), Mulieris Dignitatem (1988) and Ordinatio Sacerdotalis (1994). According to the latest ruling, found in Ordinatio Sacerdotalis, Pope John Paul II affirmed that the Catholic Church [...] "does not consider herself authorized to admit women to priestly ordination." [...] In defiance of these rulings, opposition groups such as Roman Catholic Womenpriests have performed ceremonies they affirm as sacramental ordinations (with, reputedly, an ordaining male Catholic bishop in the first few instances) which, according to canon law, are both illicit and invalid and considered mere simulations of the sacrament of ordination. The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith responded by issuing a statement clarifying that any Catholic bishops involved in ordination ceremonies for women, as well as the <b>women</b> <b>themselves</b> if they were Catholic, would automatically receive the penalty of excommunication (latae sententiae, literally [...] "with the sentence already applied", i.e. automatically), citing canon 1378 of canon law and other church laws.|$|E

2500|$|Psychologist Joseph Pleck {{argues that}} a {{hierarchy}} of masculinity exists largely as a dichotomy of homosexual and heterosexual males: [...] "Our society uses the male heterosexual-homosexual dichotomy as a central symbol for all the rankings of masculinity, for the division on any grounds between males who are [...] "real men" [...] and have power, and males who are not". Michael Kimmel adds that the trope [...] "You're so gay" [...] indicates a lack of masculinity, rather than homosexual orientation. According to Pleck, to avoid male oppression of <b>women,</b> <b>themselves</b> and other men, patriarchal structures, institutions and discourse must be eliminated from Western society.|$|E
