40|$|Introduction We {{continue}} our work in trec performing runs in adhoc, routing {{and part of}} the cross language track. The major investigations this year are the weight schemes modification {{to take into account the}} document length. We also experiment the high precision procedure in automatic adhoc environment by tuning the term weight parameters. 2 Mercure model Mercure is an information retrieval system based on a connexionist approach and modelled by a network (as shown in the figure 1) containing an input representing the query, a term layer representing the indexing terms, a document layer representing the documents and an output representing the retrieved documents. The term nodes (or neurons) are connected to the document nodes (or neurons) by <b>weighted</b> <b>indexing</b> links. Mercure includes the implementation of two main components : the query evaluation based on spreading activation from the input to the output through the indexing links and the automatic query m...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the {{experiment}} was to answer the que:Aion wnether broad or narrow terms function most effectively in the retrieval of relevant documents. The answer depends on waat the user of the retrieval system wants, his wants being expressed in term of _stated pzecision-recail preference, or by {{the exact number of}} relevant documents he wishes to retrieve. Depth of indexing does not contribute significantly to effective retrieval. Documents should be indexed with broad terms to satisfy recall preferences with narrow terms to satisfy precision preferences since the amount of material retrieved in a system is not a simple function of the total numbers of terms posted to documents in the collection. At high cut-off values the retrieval power of broad and narrow terms tends to become equalized. Precision can be improved through raising the cut-off point and deleting broad terms. Experiments with <b>weighted</b> <b>indexing</b> provided poor results, and with title-term indexing gave inconclusive results. (AB...|$|E
40|$|Fundamental {{indexing}} {{based on}} accounting valuation has drawn significant interest from academics and practitioners {{in recent times}} {{as an alternative to}} capitalization <b>weighted</b> <b>indexing</b> based on market valuation. This paper investigates the claims of superiority of fundamental indexation strategy by using data for Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) listed stocks between 1985 and 2010. Not only do our results strongly support the outperformance claims observed in other geographical markets, we find that the excess returns from fundamental indexation in Australian market are actually much higher. The fundamental indexation strategy does underperform during strong bull markets although this effect diminishes with longer time horizons. On a rolling five years basis, the fundamental index always outperforms the capitalization-weighted index. Contrary to many previous studies, our results show that superior performance of fundamental indexation could not be attributed to value, size, or momentum effects. Overall, the findings indicate that fundamental indexation could offer potential outperformance of traditional indexation based on market capitalization even after adjusting for the former’s slightly higher turnover and transaction costs. ...|$|E

40|$|Organizations should {{measure their}} {{information}} security performance {{if they wish}} to take the right decisions and develop it in line with their security needs. Since the measurement of information security is generally underdeveloped in practice and many organizations find the existing recommendations too complex, the paper presents a solution {{in the form of a}} 10 by 10 information security performance measurement model. The model—ISP 10 × 10 M is composed of ten critical success factors, 100 key performance indicators and 6 performance levels. Its content was devised on the basis of findings presented in the current research studies and standards, while its structure results from an empirical research conducted among information security professionals from Slovenia. Results of the study show that a high level of information security performance is mostly dependent on measures aimed at managing information risks, employees and information sources, while formal and environmental factors have a lesser impact. Experts believe that information security should evolve systematically, where it’s recommended that beginning steps include technical, logical and physical security controls, while advanced activities should relate predominantly strategic management activities. By applying the proposed model, organizations are able to determine the actual level of information security performance based on the <b>weighted</b> <b>indexing</b> technique. In this manner they identify the measures they ought to develop in order to improve the current situation. The ISP 10 × 10 M is a useful tool for conducting internal system evaluations and decision-making. It may also be applied to a larger sample of organizations in order to determine the general state-of-play for research purposes...|$|E

The evaluation methods are applied to both value weighted and equally <b>weighted</b> <b>indices</b> based on Swedish real estate return data. All methods show that, if any, diversifying over property types is a better strategy on the Swedish market than diversifying over regions. No test yields significant support for regional diversification. The support for the property type strategy is stronger when using equally <b>weighted</b> <b>indices.</b> QC 20170512 </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{evidence}} of slowly mean-reverting components in stock prices has been controversial. The hypothesis of stock price mean-reversion is tested using a regression model that yields the highest asymptotic power among {{a class of}} regression tests. Although {{the evidence that the}} equally <b>weighted</b> <b>index</b> of stocks exhibits mean-reversion is significant in the period 1926 - 88, this phenomenon is entirely concentrated in January. In the postwar period, both the equally weighted and the value-weighted indices exhibit seasonal mean-reversion in January. A similar phenomenon is also observed for the equally <b>weighted</b> <b>index</b> of stocks traded on the London Stock Exchange. Copyright 1991 by American Finance Association. ...|$|R
