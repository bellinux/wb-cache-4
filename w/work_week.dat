5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Atlanta, Georgia's capital city, {{underwent}} significant {{economic and social}} change. To serve a growing economy based on manufacturing and commerce, many people left the countryside to relocate in Atlanta, often in primitive housing. Employment conditions in the city included child labor, a 66-hour <b>work</b> <b>week,</b> low wages, and unregulated and unsafe work sites. Men from the traditional and paternalistic rural society felt it degrading that their womenfolk were forced into the city to work in factories. Mixed gender workplaces were seen as places for potential corruption.|$|E
5|$|Contact {{with skin}} is dangerous, and {{adequate}} ventilation {{should be provided}} when melting this metal. Thallium(I) compounds have a high aqueous solubility and are readily absorbed through the skin. Exposure by inhalation should not exceed 0.1mg per cubic metre in an 8-hour time-weighted average (40-hour <b>work</b> <b>week).</b> Thallium will readily absorb through the skin and care {{should be taken to}} avoid this route of exposure as cutaneous absorption can exceed the absorbed dose received by inhalation at the PEL. Thallium is a suspected human carcinogen. For a long time thallium compounds were readily available as rat poison. This fact and that it is water-soluble and nearly tasteless led to frequent intoxication caused by accident or criminal intent.|$|E
5|$|In August 1934, Hitler {{appointed}} Reichsbank President Hjalmar Schacht as Minister of Economics, and in {{the following}} year, as Plenipotentiary for War Economy in charge of preparing the economy for war. Reconstruction and rearmament were financed through Mefo bills, printing money, and seizing the assets of people arrested as enemies of the State, including Jews. Unemployment fell from six million in 1932 to one million in 1936. Hitler oversaw {{one of the largest}} infrastructure improvement campaigns in German history, leading to the construction of dams, autobahns, railroads, and other civil works. Wages were slightly lower in the mid to late 1930s compared with wages during the Weimar Republic, while the cost of living increased by 25 percent. The average <b>work</b> <b>week</b> increased during the shift to a war economy; by 1939, the average German was working between 47 and 50 hours a week.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the NHL's {{collective}} bargaining agreement (CBA) expiring in September, teams reassigned players on two-way or entry-level contracts to minor league affiliates. The Canucks assigned 27 players, including Christopher Tanev, Eddie Lack, Zack Kassian and 2012 second-round draft pick Alexandre Mallet to the Chicago Wolves, while first round pick Brendan Gaunce was sent to his junior team, the Belleville Bulls. When the CBA expired on September 15, the NHL enforced a lockout until a new agreement could be reached. Canucks management posted {{a message from the}} team to the fans stating that they would continue with community initiatives throughout the lockout, which they hoped would be resolved as soon as possible, and thanked fans for their loyalty and patience. They also reduced their employees <b>work</b> <b>week</b> to four days and instituted a 20% pay reduction.|$|E
5|$|The bids {{from private}} {{companies}} were {{heavily influenced by}} the legislation of the New Deal. The Vinson-Trammell Act limited profit from a ship's construction to 10percent, while the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act specified a minimum wage and required working conditions for workers. The latter act greatly affected {{the ability of the}} navy to acquire steel, as the text of the law caused friction between executives in the industry, who greatly disliked the forty-hour <b>work</b> <b>week</b> and minimum wage requirements, and their workers—who themselves were embroiled in a separate dispute pitting the union of the skilled workers, the American Federation of Labor, against the union of the unskilled, the Congress of Industrial Organizations. Amid the unrest, the navy ran into difficulties trying to acquire 18million pounds of steel to build six destroyers and three submarines; many more pounds than this would be needed for the new battleships.|$|E
25|$|Typographers were educated, {{economically}} mobile, {{in every}} major urban center with newspapers, and had the unique possibility to influence publicity in favour of their cause. This led the union {{to the forefront of}} improving working conditions. ITU President W.B. Prescott led the ITU in 1897 to win a 48-hour <b>work</b> <b>week</b> and a standard wage scale for all printers. During the Great Depression, the ITU introduced the 40-hour <b>work</b> <b>week</b> across the industry at no cost to employers as a way to share the fewer jobs available. That ITU initiative spread to other unions and has since been codified across the labor sector by federal legislation in the U.S. establishing the 40-hour <b>work</b> <b>week.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1930, the Kellogg Company {{announced}} {{that most of}} its factories would shift towards 30-hour <b>work</b> <b>weeks,</b> from the usual 40. W.K.

This practice remained until World War II, and continued briefly after the war, although some departments and factories remained locked into 30-hour <b>work</b> <b>weeks</b> until 1980.|$|R
