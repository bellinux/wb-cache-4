5|$|Rumors persist that McAleer's {{death was}} the result of a self-inflicted gunshot <b>wound</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> head.

A three-CD set Vivacitas was released, with the third CD being an interview with Emerson, Jackson and Davison. Dave Kilminster guested on guitar at the concerts. Davison died on 15 April 2008 aged 65 in Horns Cross, Devon, from a brain tumour. Emerson died on 11 March 2016 in Santa Monica, California, of an apparently self-inflicted gunshot <b>wound</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> head.|$|E

40|$|Penetrating knife <b>wounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> spine {{are rare}} events. The {{appropriate}} treatment paradigm for such injuries is variable {{and is often}} predicated upon the degree of injury and the structures involved.

5|$|At {{approximately}} 1:43p.m. CST (19:43 UTC), Hawkins {{stepped out}} of the elevator on the third floor and opened fire. He killed eight people and wounded four others over the course of six minutes, before dying from a self-inflicted gunshot <b>wound</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> head near the customer service desk. He fired more than 30 rounds, striking 12 people. Six were killed instantly, one died before reaching the hospital, and another died 45 minutes after reaching the ER of another hospital.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{disadvantage}} in numbers {{as well as}} attacking a fixed position, Williams' and Macdonell's small force was driving the opposing force {{to the edge of}} the gorge on which the redan was situated, and seemed on the verge of success before the Americans were able to regroup and stand firm. The momentum of the battle turned when a musket ball hit Macdonell's mount (causing it to rear and twist around) and another shot hit him in the small of the back, causing him to fall from the horse. He was removed from the battlefield and died from his injuries early the next day. Captain Williams was laid low by a <b>wound</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> head, and Dennis by a severe <b>wound</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> thigh (although he continued to lead his detachment throughout the action). Carrying Macdonnell and the body of Brock, the British fell back through Queenston to Durham's Farm, a mile north near Vrooman's Point.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo prospectively {{evaluate}} {{the safety and}} accuracy of physical examination in determining the management of stable patients with gunshot <b>wounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> neck. DesignProspective study of 59 patients with gunshot <b>wounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> neck. Patients and methodsFifty-nine stable patients with gunshot <b>wounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> neck managed between December 2001 and August 2003. All patients had a physical examination and routine angiography according to a written protocol approved by the research ethics committee. The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of physical examination were assessed and compared with the angiographic findings. ResultsThirteen patients with positive findings on physical examination (history of bleeding, haematoma, minimal bleeding, thrill, bruit and pulse deficit) and 10 patients without clinical signs of vascular injury had vascular injury. A sensitivity of 57 %, specificity 53 %, positive predictive value 43 % and negative predictive value of 67 % were calculated for physical examination alone in detecting vascular injury. ConclusionFindings on physical examination are not good predictors of vascular injury in stable patients with gunshot <b>wounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> neck. Our findings question the validity of physical examination alone, as a safe and accurate assessment of patients with gunshot <b>wounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> neck. Arteriography or ultrasonography is needed to identify vascular injuries...|$|R
5|$|In December 1923, {{while visiting}} the Winchester {{residence}} of W. A.

The longcase clock inflicted a severe <b>wound</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> back of Cornwell's head. He received first aid treatment from a physician present at the residence and was taken to his Winchester home where he regained consciousness.|$|E

5|$|White House Press Secretary James Brady was {{the most}} seriously wounded victim; he was left paralyzed from a gunshot <b>wound</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> head.

40|$|Introduction: This is {{a review}} of gunshot <b>wounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> chest. Although {{uncommon}} in Norway, they represent a big health problem {{in other parts of}} the world and in war situations. Method: A systematic literature search using PubMed and McMaster+. Results: Gunshot <b>wounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> chest can be highly lethal. Depending on the injured organ, a large percentage of the patients die before reaching the hospital. There is a big difference between low-velocity and high-velocity weapons. Low velocity injuries are most common in the civilian sector, whereas high-velocity injuries are over-represented in war zones and cause much greater tissue damage. The initial evaluation at <b>the</b> hospital needs <b>to</b> be quick and well practiced in order <b>to</b> rush <b>the</b> most critical patients to treatment and surgery without delay. All organs in the thoracic cavity may potentially be harmed. Parenchymal lung injury is the most common and the usual form of presentation is hemo- or pneumohemothorax. The most common forms of presentation of cardiac injury are cardiac tamponade and excessive hemorrhage. However, most patients with gunshot <b>wounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> chest can be managed non-operatively, or with a simple chest drain. Conclusion: Gunshot <b>wounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> chest are dangerous injuries. In order to decrease mortality, good systems for transportation and experienced personnel are necessary...|$|R
5|$|In March 1792, the King {{commissioned}} Prince Ernest Augustus as {{a colonel}} into the 9th Hanoverian Light Dragoons. The Prince {{served in the}} Low Countries in the War of the First Coalition, under his elder brother Frederick, Duke of York, then commander of the combined British, Hanoverian, and Austrian forces. Seeing action near the Walloon town of Tournai in August 1793, he sustained a sabre <b>wound</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> head, {{which resulted in a}} disfiguring scar. During the Battle of Tourcoing in northern France on 18 May 1794 his left arm was injured by a cannonball which passed close by him. In the days after the battle, the sight in his left eye faded. In June, he was sent to Britain to convalesce, his first stay there since 1786.|$|E
5|$|In March 1916, Phillipps was {{deployed}} to France with the 28th Battalion for {{service on the}} Western Front. He participated in a raid against the forts of Armentières {{on the night of}} 6/7June, and saw action during the Battle of Pozières in July. On 5August, he was shot through the thigh, requiring evacuation to England for hospital treatment. He was promoted to captain on 12August. Phillipps rejoined his unit in October but suffered another gunshot <b>wound</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> thigh the following month, near Gueudecourt. He returned to England once more to recover, and remained in hospital until 2March 1917.|$|E
5|$|In late November 1916, the 34th Battalion {{was shipped}} to France for {{service on the}} Western Front. Initially posted to the Armentières sector in Belgium, the {{battalion}} {{did not participate in}} its first major battle until June 1917, when it took part in the Battle of Messines after the British and Dominion operations switched to the Ypres sector of Belgium. During the engagement, Jeffries received a bullet <b>wound</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> thigh while leading a reconnaissance patrol and was evacuated to the 3rdGeneral Hospital in London. While recuperating, he was promoted to captain on 26 June, before rejoining his battalion in September as a company commander.|$|E

5|$|The Territorals and 10 Troop made a {{sweep of}} the river line, but on {{rounding}} {{a bend in the}} stream were suddenly fired upon by the hidden guerrillas.
