In this study, floral morphology <b>and</b> <b>mating</b> <b>system</b> functioning are compared between recently established and older {{populations of the}} annual plant Blackstonia perfoliata that occur in different pollinator environments. Hand-pollination and emasculation experiments were conducted to assess the extent of pollinator-mediated pollen deposition and pollen limitation, and the contribution of autonomous selfing to total seed production. Detailed measurements of key floral traits were performed to compare the flower morphology <b>and</b> <b>mating</b> <b>system</b> functioning between plants from both pollination environments. Pollinator-mediated pollen deposition was about twice as low in the recently colonized and pollinator-poor environment compared with the old and pollinator-rich sites, but total seed set was little affected by any type of pollen limitation. The contribution of autonomous selfing to total seed production was higher in the pollinator-poor sites than in the pollinator-rich sites (index of reproductive assurance 056 and 017, respectively), and seed production was only poorly affected by selfing, whereas in the pollinator-rich populations selfing reduced total reproductive output by about 40 compared with outcross pollination. Plants originating from pollinator-poor environments produced smaller flowers that showed significantly lower levels of dichogamy (i. e. protogyny) and herkogamy. These reductions resulted in a 2 -fold higher capacity for autonomous selfing under pollinator-free conditions (index of autonomous selfing 081 and 041 in plants originating from the pollinator-poor and pollinator-rich environment, respectively). The results illustrate that plant populations colonizing novel environments can differ markedly in floral morphology <b>and</b> <b>mating</b> <b>system</b> functioning.

In {{the absence of}} substantial mitotic mutation, perennials have higher mean fitness and lower, or even negative, inbreeding depression than annuals with the same <b>mating</b> <b>system.</b> As in annuals, self fertilization exposes deleterious recessive mutations to selection, increasing mean fitness and decreasing inbreeding depression. Including mitotic mutation decreases mean fitness while increasing inbreeding depression. Perenniality introduces a kind of selective sieve, such that strongly recessive mutations contribute disproportionately to mean fitness and inbreeding depression. In the presence of high mitotic mutation, this selective sieve may provide a mechanistic basis for high inbreeding depression observed in some long lived perennials. Without substantial mitotic mutation, {{it is difficult to}} reconcile genetically based models of inbreeding depression with the empirical generalization that perennials outcross while related annuals self fertilize...|$|R

Food abundance should influence the value of each sex's contribution to the production of offspring and, thereby, the level of sexual selection. We examined this hypothesis in two populations (Alberta and Ontario, Canada) of tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) that differed greatly in food abundance. Male removal experiments and natural cases of polygyny indicated that females without male parental care produced fewer offspring in the area (Ontario) with less abundant food. Relative to their mates, males also fed their nestlings more often in Ontario than in Alberta. Despite the difference between areas in the relative importance of male parental care, we did not find more polygyny in Alberta than in Ontario. The lack of relationship between frequency of polygyny and the contribution of male parental care to offspring production suggests that other factors such as female-female competition can influence the level of sexual selection independently of sexual differences in parental investment.
