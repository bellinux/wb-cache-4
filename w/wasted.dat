Potatoes, bread slices and apples are respectively the most <b>wasted</b> foods by quantity, while salads are thrown away in the greatest proportion.

The jump of <b>waste</b> charges, especially since 1990, has originated in the changed institutional setting of <b>waste</b> management, for its part a result of increasing <b>waste</b> material. It includes an expansion of <b>waste</b> management services (for instance, <b>waste</b> treatment, <b>waste</b> disposal), higher technical demands referring to <b>waste</b> disposal (<b>waste</b> incineration, <b>waste</b> disposal sites) and excess capacity of municipal incinerators resulting from a higher percentage of <b>waste</b> recycling. In addition to financing disposal and treatment, <b>waste</b> charges shall also give financial incentives to <b>waste</b> avoidance considering the social costs of <b>waste</b> management (for instance, pollutants of <b>waste</b> incineration) ("ecological <b>waste</b> charges").
