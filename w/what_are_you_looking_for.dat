[...] Of that theme, Reichardt said [...] "I guess it’s just a good setup for different kinds of searching: question-asking, looking for the next place to go, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for,</b> what are you leaving. All those things are good for grounding it in getting from point A to point B." ...|$|E

5000|$|One asked: [...] "What is {{the realm}} of the Three Eyes?" [...] The master said: [...] "I enter with you {{the realm of}} utter purity, wear the robe of purity and expound the Dharmakaya Buddha. Or we enter the realm of non-differentiation and expound the Sambhogakaya Buddha. Or again, we enter the realm of deliverance, wear the robe of {{radiance}} and speak of the Nirmanakaya Buddha. The realms of the Three Eyes depend on change. To explain it from the point of the Sutras and Treatises, the Dharmakaya is the fundamental. The Sambhogakaya and the Nirmanakaya are the functions. But as I see it, the Dharmakaya cannot expound (or comprehend) the Dharma. Thus an old master said: [...] "The (Buddha's) bodies are set up with reference to meaning; The (Buddha's) realms are differentiated with reference to the bodies." [...] The nature of the bodies and of the realms is clear; they are the temple of the Dharma, and so are only relative. [...] "Yellow leaves in the empty fist to entice unweaned children." [...] Spikes of water-chestnuts — what juice are you looking for in those dry bones? There is no Dharma outside the heart mind, nor anything to find inside.

5000|$|At around 08:00, {{military}} correspondent Ze'ev Schiff {{received a}} tip-off a {{source in the}} General Staff in Tel Aviv {{that there had been}} a slaughter in the camps. Checking round for some hours, he got no confirmation other than that there [...] "there's something." [...] At 11:00 he met with Mordechai Tzipori, Minister of Communications and conveyed his information. Unable to reach Military Intelligence by phone, he got in touch with Yitzhak Shamir at 11:19 asking him to check reports of a Phalangist slaughter in the camps. Shamir testified that from his recollection the main thing Tzipori had told him of was that 3/4 IDF soldiers killed, no mention of a massacre or slaughter, as opposed to a [...] "rampage" [...] had been made. He made no check because his impression was that the point of the information was to keep him updated on IDF losses. At a meeting with American diplomats at 12:30 Shamir made no mention of what Tzipori told him, saying he expected that he would hear from Ariel Sharon, the Military Intelligence chief and the American Morris Draper about the situation in West Beirut, At that noontime meeting Sharon insisted that [...] "terrorists" [...] needed [...] "mopping up." [...] Americans pressed for the intervention of the Lebanese National Army, and for an I.D.F. withdrawal immediately. Sharon replied:"I just don’t understand, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for?</b> Do you want the terrorists to stay? Are you afraid that somebody will think that you were in collusion with us? Deny it. We denied it,"adding that nothing would happen except perhaps for a few more terrorists being killed, which would be a benefit to all. Shamir and Sharon finally agreed to a gradual withdrawal, at the end of Rosh Hashana, two days later. Draper then warned them:"Sure, the I.D.F. is going to stay in West Beirut and they will let the Lebanese go and kill the Palestinians in the camps."Sharon replied:-"So, we’ll kill them. They will not be left there. You are not going to save them. You are not going to save these groups of the international terrorism.[...] If you don’t want the Lebanese to kill them, we will kill them." ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{question}} of impact assessment {{is one that}} continues to plague microcredit practitioners. Some contend that existing impact assessment studies are meaningless, while others maintain they are absolutely necessary. The authors of this paper advocate a renewed focus on the transformation of clients and their communities, {{as well as a}} new impact assessment model to support and document this focus. They outline the key principles for conducting impact audits that include measurement of transformation among clients. They also review a series of practitioner-oriented impact assessment tools and outline future challenges for practitioners, donors, and academics in improving performance through impact assessment. “Hey, mister, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> under that light?” “My keys. ” “Why, did you lose them there?” “No, I lost them across the street. ” “Then why don’t you look for them across the street?” “Because the light’s better over here. ” Measuring Transformation It’s an old joke, but it aptly illustrates {{the current state of the}} practice related to impact measurement and microcredit. The micro-credit movement exists to alleviate poverty. Yet the only perfor-mance indicators used to gauge the effectiveness of microcredit programs measure the profitability of the lending institution and the quality of its portfolio. They don’t tell us whether our clients become less poor due to the services we provide. Why do we rely solely on these financial performance measures if they don’t tell us if we’re achieving our objective? Because they are much easier to calculate reliably. We spend our time investigating the well-lit areas, while the object we’re searching for remains in the dark. Our Purpose This paper aims a small band of light on the subject of client impact measurement for microcredit. We examine the need for good impact measurement tools, describe some of the challenges we face as we try to come, up with such, identify elements of an ideal impact assessment, and describe some tools that can help us measure our impact. We also try to get a few jabs in at those who keep telling us that impact measurement is not important. We recognize that the subject of impact measurement has been hotly debated and frequently studied by experts, most recently b...|$|E
