5000|$|Signal <b>whips</b> (or signalwhips) are {{a type of}} single-tailed <b>whip,</b> {{originally}} designed to control dog teams. A signal <b>whip</b> usually measures between 3 and 4 feet in length. Signal <b>whips</b> and snake <b>whips</b> are similar. What distinguishes a signal <b>whip</b> from a snake <b>whip</b> {{is the absence of}} a [...] "fall". A fall is a piece of leather attached {{to the end of the}} body of the <b>whip.</b> In a snake <b>whip,</b> the [...] "cracker" [...] attaches to the fall. In a signal <b>whip,</b> the cracker attaches directly to the body of the <b>whip.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Government Chief <b>Whip</b> is {{assisted}} by the Deputy Chief <b>Whip,</b> other <b>Whips,</b> and Assistant <b>Whips.</b> In {{order to give}} them a salary for what is in essence a party office, the government <b>whips</b> are appointed to positions in HM Treasury and in the Royal Household under the Lord Steward of the Household. The <b>whips</b> are not fully active in either of these departments, though do undertake a number of responsibilities. The Deputy Chief <b>Whip</b> is Treasurer of HM Household, the next two <b>Whips</b> are Comptroller of HM Household and Vice-Chamberlain of HM Household, and the remaining <b>Whips</b> are Lords Commissioners of the Treasury. Assistant <b>Whips,</b> and <b>Whips</b> of opposition parties, generally do not receive such appointments.|$|R
5000|$|According to {{the book}} The Chain <b>Whip,</b> this may refer to the hard <b>whip</b> (more akin to a {{truncheon}} than a multi-section <b>whip)</b> due to the ambiguity in the Chinese. [...] "Both the hard <b>whip</b> and the soft <b>whip</b> can both be referred to simply as <b>whip</b> (鞭) in Chinese.". Different books make wildly differing claims {{about the history of}} the Chain <b>Whip.</b>|$|R

5|$|As can be {{seen from}} the above, in this early reference, no mention is made of live animals as co-inhabitants within the sack, nor is the mention of any initial <b>whipping</b> {{contained}}, nor that Malleolus, contained within the sack, was transported to the river in a cart driven by black oxen.|$|E
5|$|Blassingame {{asserts that}} slave parents {{attempted}} to shield infants {{and young children}} from the brutality of the plantation. When children understood that they were enslaved (usually after their first <b>whipping),</b> parents dissuaded angry urges to run away or seek revenge.|$|E
50|$|The <b>whip</b> cracker spins the <b>whip</b> {{anti-clockwise}} (if right-handed) {{over his}} or her head. When the <b>whip</b> is approximately 90 degrees {{to the right of}} the <b>whip</b> cracker, he or she swings the <b>whip</b> in the opposite direction. It is one of the simplest techniques, yet it can be one of the loudest used in <b>whip</b> cracking.|$|R
50|$|That {{arrangement}} persists today. Labor and the Liberals {{each have}} a chief <b>whip</b> and two <b>whips</b> in the House of Representatives and a chief <b>whip</b> and a two deputy <b>whips</b> in the Senate. The Nationals have a chief <b>whip</b> and <b>whip</b> in the House and one <b>whip</b> in the Senate. In addition, the Greens have had a <b>whip</b> in the Senate since May 1995. Other parties have also had <b>whips.</b> When the Democratic Labor Party (now the Democratic Labour Party) increased from two to four senators in July 1968, it elected a <b>whip</b> who served until he {{and the rest of}} the DLP senators lost their seats at the 1974 double dissolution election. The Australian Democrats had a <b>whip</b> from 1981 until 2008, when all four senators left office following their loss at the 2007 election.|$|R
50|$|By 1994, {{all three}} major {{parties in the}} House of Representatives had a <b>whip</b> and a deputy <b>whip,</b> but only the National Party's deputy <b>whip</b> did not receive an {{additional}} salary. On 12 May 1994, Kim Beazley, then the Leader of the House, announced that, {{in conjunction with the}} creation of the second debating chamber, the Government <b>Whip</b> in the House of Representatives would become the Chief Government <b>Whip,</b> and his deputy would become the Government <b>Whip.</b> In addition, a second junior <b>whip</b> would be added. Beazley offered the same arrangement for the Liberal Party and to see that the Nationals' deputy received a salary. Labor elected its <b>whip</b> that day, and the Liberals appointed an additional <b>whip</b> on 2 June 1994, with the new <b>whip</b> responsible for business in the second chamber.|$|R

5|$|Jackson {{and some}} of his {{siblings}} said they had been physically and psychologically abused by their father, Joseph Jackson. In 2003, Joseph admitted to <b>whipping</b> them as children, but has emphatically rejected the longstanding abuse allegations. The whippings deeply traumatized Jackson and may have led to the onset of further health issues later in his life. Physicians speculated that he had body dysmorphic disorder.|$|E

5|$|If found, punishments {{ranged from}} death, {{to time in}} the pillory, to being ordered never to dress as a man again. Henry Fielding wrote a {{pamphlet}} titled The Female Husband in 1746, based {{on the life of}} Mary Hamilton, who was arrested after marrying a woman while masquerading as a man, and was sentenced to public <b>whipping</b> and six months in jail. Similar examples were procured of Catharine Linck in Prussia in 1717, executed in 1721; Swiss Anne Grandjean married and relocated with her wife to Lyons, but was exposed by a woman with whom she had had a previous affair and sentenced to time in the stocks and prison.|$|E
5|$|Mary Tudor, {{daughter}} of Catherine of Aragon and Henry VIII, spent 19 months at Ludlow overseeing the Council of the Marches between 1525 and 1528, {{along with her}} entourage of servants, advisors, and guardians. The relatively small sum of £5 was spent restoring the castle before her arrival. The council's wide ranging role was reinforced in legislation in 1534, and its purpose was further elaborated in the Act of Union of 1543; some presidents, such as Bishop Rowland Lee, used its harsher powers extensively to execute local criminals, but later presidents typically preferred to punish with the pillory, <b>whipping</b> or imprisonment in the castle. The Great Chamber itself {{was used as the}} council's meeting room.|$|E
50|$|Snake <b>whips</b> (or snakewhips) are {{a type of}} single-tailed <b>whip.</b> The name snake <b>whip</b> {{is derived}} from the fact that this type of <b>whip</b> has no handle inside and so can be curled up into a small circle which resembles a coiled snake. They were once {{commonly}} carried in the saddlebag by cowboys of the old west. A full sized snake <b>whip</b> is usually at least 4 feet in length (excluding the fall and cracker {{at the tip of the}} <b>whip)</b> and around one inch in diameter at the butt of the <b>whip.</b>|$|R

5|$|Several {{clinical}} {{studies have shown}} that MFGM could positively affect circulating lipids. A single-blind RCT in overweight adults has shown that the effects of milk fat on plasma lipids were modulated by the MFGM content; compared to butter oil (control diet), consumption of <b>whipping</b> cream (MFGM diet) for 8 weeks did not impair the lipoprotein profile. Another double-blind RCT in overweight and obese adults has also shown that MFGM attenuated the negative effects of a high-saturated fats meal by reducing postprandial cholesterol, inflammatory markers and insulin response. A double-blind RCT in normal healthy adults has indicated that one month consumption of buttermilk rich in MFGM led to reduction in serum cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels as well as blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|The {{market place}} at the centre of Poulton is the width of two streets and is now closed to motor traffic. Lying south of St Chad's Church and {{surrounded}} by shops, the square contains the town's war memorial {{as well as a}} market cross, stocks, <b>whipping</b> post and fish slabs, from which fish were sold on market days. Although many of the buildings surrounding the market place were rebuilt following a fire in the 18thcentury, a few of the earlier buildings remain. To the south of the market place are town houses that were built for local merchants and professionals.|$|E
5|$|A French edition, {{translated}} by M. L. Carion (or by Louise Swanton-Belloc? (1796–1881)), appeared by 1853 published in Cambrai and in Paris. By 1857, the novel had {{been translated into}} 20 languages, including two independent translations into Slovene just one year after its original publication, which started the since-then uninterrupted dialogue between American authors and Slovene translators and readers. Later, it was translated into almost every major language, including Chinese (with translator Lin Shu creating the first Chinese translation of an American novel in 1901) and Amharic (with the 1930 translation created in support of Ethiopian efforts to end the suffering of blacks in that nation). The book was so widely read that Sigmund Freud reported a number of patients with sado-masochistic tendencies who he believed had been influenced by reading about the <b>whipping</b> of slaves in Uncle Tom's Cabin.|$|E

5|$|A rough collie named Lad {{lives at}} the Place with his Master, Mistress, and his mate, Lady. When Knave, a younger collie, is boarded at the Place, Lady begins {{ignoring}} Lad {{in favor of the}} newcomer. During a romp in the forest with Knave, Lady is caught in a leghold trap. Knave leaves her there and returns home but Lad finds her. Several days later, the still limping Lady accidentally gets locked in the library and is subsequently blamed for the destruction of the Master's beloved mounted bald eagle. The Master starts to whip her, but Lad intervenes and takes the <b>whipping</b> himself, knowing Knave was the culprit. Later, he attacks Knave for getting Lady in trouble, sending him fleeing from the Place. As the Master apologizes to Lad, Lady lovingly licks his wounds from the fight.|$|E
5|$|Ankor (Alexander England) is {{a member}} of the {{security}} unit aboard the Covenant. Shortly after awakening from the neutrino burst, he attempts to save Branson from his cryosleep pod, but he is unable to in time and the captain is burnt to death. Ankor assists Tennessee with the space walk for repairing the solar recharge sails. Ankor is a part of the expedition to the surface of the Engineer home world, where they set off to investigate the intercepted signal at the crashed Engineer ship. Upon returning to the lander and witnessing it explode, the expedition is ambushed by two Neomorphs. Ankor shoots one of them, but the creature responds by <b>whipping</b> his jaw off with its tail, killing him instantly.|$|E
5|$|Determined {{to avoid}} battle, Lacrosse turned southeast, hoping {{to use his}} wider spread of sail to outrun his {{opponent}} in the strong winds. Pellew, however, manoeuvred to cut the Droits de l'Homme off from the French coast, at this stage still unsure {{of the nature of}} his opponent. As the chase developed, the weather, which had been violent for the entire preceding month, worsened. An Atlantic gale swept the Ushant headland, driving a blizzard eastwards and <b>whipping</b> the sea into a turbulent state, making steering and aiming more difficult. At 16:15, two of Droits de l'Hommes topmasts broke in the strong winds. This dramatically slowed the French ship, and allowed Pellew, who had recognised his opponent as a French ship of the line, to close with Droits de l'Homme.|$|E
