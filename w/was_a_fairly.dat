5|$|After the war, Murphy {{enjoyed a}} 21-year acting career.

He made guest {{appearances}} on celebrity television shows and starred in the series Whispering Smith. Murphy <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> accomplished songwriter.

5|$|Norman {{government}} under William {{was similar to}} the government that had existed under earlier dukes. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> simple administrative system, built around the ducal household, which consisted of a group of officers including stewards, butlers, and marshalls. The duke travelled constantly around the duchy, confirming charters and collecting revenues. Most of the income came from the ducal lands, as well as from tolls and a few taxes. This income was collected by the chamber, one of the household departments.|$|E
5|$|On that night, Lee maneuvered {{the small}} craft {{out to the}} anchorage. It took two hours to reach his destination, as it was hard work {{manipulating}} the hand-operated controls and foot pedals to propel the submersible into position.

5|$|Anti-malware {{researchers}} also exploited Heartbleed {{to their own}} advantage in order to access secret forums used by cybercriminals. Studies were also conducted by deliberately setting up vulnerable machines. For example, on April 12, 2014, at least two independent researchers were able to steal private keys from an experimental server intentionally set up for that purpose by CloudFlare. Also, on April 15, 2014, J. Alex Halderman, a professor at University of Michigan, reported that his honeypot server, an intentionally vulnerable server designed to attract attacks in order to study them, had received numerous attacks originating from China. Halderman concluded that because it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> obscure server, these attacks were probably sweeping attacks affecting {{large areas of the}} Internet.|$|E

5|$|Noronhomys vespuccii <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> large rodent, {{larger than}} the black rat (Rattus rattus). A {{member of the family}} Cricetidae and {{subfamily}} Sigmodontinae, it shares several distinctive characters with Holochilus and related genera within the tribe Oryzomyini, including high-crowned molars with simplified crown features and the presence of several ridges on the skull which help anchor the chewing muscles. Although a suite of traits suggest that Holochilus is its closest relative, it is distinctive in many ways and is therefore classified in a separate genus, Noronhomys. Its close relatives, including Holochilus and Lundomys, are adapted to a semiaquatic lifestyle, spending much of their time in the water, but features of the Noronhomys bones suggest that it lost its semiaquatic lifestyle after arrival at its remote island.|$|E
5|$|The 1949 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was the last}} season that tropical cyclones were not publicly named by the United States Weather Bureau. It officially began on June15, and lasted until November15. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. The first storm, Hurricane One, developed north of the Lesser Antilles on August21. The final system, Tropical Storm Sixteen, dissipated in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on November5. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> active season, featuring 16tropical storms and seven hurricanes. Two of these strengthened into major hurricanes, which are Category3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale.|$|E
5|$|The 2001 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> active Atlantic {{hurricane season}} that produced 17 tropical cyclones, 15 named storms, nine hurricanes, and four major hurricanes. The season officially lasted from June 1, 2001, to November 30, 2001, dates which by convention limit {{the period of}} each year when tropical cyclones tend to form in the Atlantic Ocean basin. The season began with Tropical Storm Allison on June 4, and ended with Hurricane Olga, which dissipated on December 6. The most intense storm was Hurricane Michelle, which attained Category 4 strength on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale.|$|E

5|$|The {{site was}} first settled between 600 and 300 BC, {{in the latter}} portion of the Middle Preclassic period, when it most likely <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> small site. This Maya city then had a long and {{continuous}} occupational history until the Early Postclassic, up to around AD 1250, with peaks in the Late Preclassic and Late Classic periods. Motul de San José had begun to refer to Tikal as its overlord in the late 4th century AD; by the 7th century it had switched its allegiance to Calakmul, Tikal's great rival, before returning its allegiance to Tikal in the early 8th century. In the late 8th century Motul de San José {{appears to have been}} conquered by Dos Pilas, capital of the Petexbatún kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The {{volatile}} oil, oleum cubebae, was {{the form}} in which cubeb is most commonly used as a drug, the dose being 5 to 20 minims, which may be suspended in mucilage or given after meals in a wafer. The drug exhibited the typical actions of a volatile oil, but exerted some of these to an exceptional degree. As such, it was liable to cause a cutaneous erythema {{in the course of}} its excretion by the skin, had a marked diuretic action, and <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> efficient disinfectant of the urinary passages. Its administration caused the appearance in the urine of a salt of cubebic acid which was precipitated by heat or nitric acid, and was therefore liable to be mistaken for albumin, when these two most common tests for the occurrence of albuminuria were applied.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} season, Wales {{completed}} their first full Home Nations Championship; Gould played as the lone centre {{in all three}} games. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> successful Championship for the Welsh, with a draw, a win and a loss, leaving them second in the table. Of note during the series was Bob Gould's captaincy in the second match, against Scotland, and Gould's first ever international dropped goal – which gave Wales a win over Ireland and made up for him missing a dropped goal by just a yard in their draw against England. Due to work commitments, Gould only played {{one of the two}} Wales games of the 1888 Home Nations Championship, in the country's first victory over Scotland, thanks to a single try from Thomas Pryce-Jenkins. In the second game, played away to Ireland, George Bowen was given the centre position in the last match Wales would play with a three threequarter system. Gould then missed the first Welsh international against an overseas touring side, when the New Zealand Natives were beaten at St. Helen's in Swansea, and was still absent two months later for the opening game of the 1889 Championship. Gould returned in time for the clash with Ireland where he was given the captaincy and played alongside Llanelli centre Tom Morgan. Gould lost his first match as captain, losing by two tries to nil at home – this was the first of 18 caps he earned leading his country.|$|E
