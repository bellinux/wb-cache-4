The associated procedure involves several steps, where curium is first separated and then converted by neutron bombardment in special reactors to short-lived nuclides. This procedure, nuclear transmutation, while <b>well</b> <b>documented</b> for other elements, is still being developed for curium.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{reported}} an age-related decline in dopamine synthesis and dopamine receptor density (i.e., the number of receptors) in the brain.

Changes in dopamine levels may also cause age-related changes in cognitive flexibility.|$|E

5|$|Because Eastern European Romani {{communities}} were less organised than Jewish communities, Porajmos was not <b>well</b> <b>documented.</b> There also existed a trend {{to downplay the}} actual figures, according to Ian Hancock, director of the Program of Romani Studies at the University of Texas at Austin.

Contemporary music and arts publication Trebuchet Magazine has put this to practice by asking all new writers to write a short piece (500 words) on Black Sabbath {{as a means of}} proving their creativity and voice on a <b>well</b> <b>documented</b> subject.|$|E
5|$|Donnchadh's {{career is}} not <b>well</b> <b>documented</b> in the {{surviving}} sources.

Principally, the relevant charters record his acts of patronage towards religious houses, but incidental details mentioned {{in the body of}} these texts and the witness lists subscribed to them are useful for other matters.|$|E
