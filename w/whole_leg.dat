5|$|The high walk of crocodilians, {{with the}} belly {{and most of}} the tail being held off the ground, is unique among living reptiles. It {{somewhat}} resembles the walk of a mammal, with the same sequence of limb movements: left fore, right hind, right fore, left hind. The low walk is similar to the high walk, but without the body being raised, and {{is quite different from the}} sprawling walk of salamanders and lizards. The animal can change from one walk to the other instantaneously, but the high walk is the usual means of locomotion on land. The animal may push its body up and use this form immediately, or may take one or two strides of low walk before raising the body higher. Unlike most other land vertebrates, when crocodilians increase their pace of travel they increase the speed at which the lower half of each limb (rather than the <b>whole</b> <b>leg)</b> swings forward; by this means, stride length increases while stride duration decreases.|$|E
2500|$|Intersection with Integration Versus {{was first}} {{introduced}} on the second season of 2nd Chinese version. Both of the Intersection and Versus came together As two teams will be intersected and fight for the other two teams for the <b>whole</b> <b>leg.</b> Where first, four teams will need to choose which team {{they want to be}} intersected by [...] "voting". Once both teams choose each other at the same time, it is successful intersected. Then, teams will need to do some task in some point by using head-to-head or timing. The team that wins the head-to-head challenge or the faster time will win two points. After five rounds, the team with the most points will automatically be first place. The second team will do a head-to-head challenge again. The winning team will keep while the losing team be eliminated.

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the differ-ence between the medial distal tibial angle (MDTA) when measured on whole lower limb radiographs and mortise radio-graphs of the ankle. Materials and Methods: A total of 48 legs were included of 24 healthy volunteers. Standard radio-graphs were obtained of the <b>whole</b> lower <b>leg.</b> Mortise radio-graphs were obtained of the ankle. The MDTA was measured on the digitized radiographs by three orthopaedic residents, one orthopaedic surgeon and one biomechanical movement scientist. For each leg, the angles measured from the two images were compared. The inter-observer reliability of each method was calculated. Results: The MDTA as measured on <b>whole</b> lower <b>leg</b> images (94. 6 ± 2. 6 degrees) was significantly different compared with the angle measured on mortise ankle images (92. 1 ± 2. 2 degrees) (p < 0. 01). The mean measurement difference between observers was less than 1 degree. Reliability of the measure-ments was good with a high association (κ = 0. 85) between observers for the angles measured on the <b>whole</b> lower <b>leg</b> images and also a high association (κ = 0. 83) between the observers for the mortise ankle image measurements. Conclusion: The MDTA is not the same on <b>whole</b> lower <b>leg</b> images and mortise views of the ankle. There was an excellent interobserver reliability for the angles measured. Clinical Relevance: Foot and ankle surgeons should take this into account when planning coronal deformity correction of the distal tibia. We believe <b>whole</b> lower <b>leg</b> images should be used to assess the medial distal tibial angle...|$|R

60|$|Through the {{principle}} of correlated variability, taken in its widest sense, when one part varies other parts vary, either simultaneously, or one after the other. Thus, an organ modified during an early embryonic period affects other parts subsequently developed. When an organ, such as the beak, increases or decreases in length, adjoining or correlated parts, as the tongue and the orifice of the nostrils, tend to vary in the same manner. When the whole body increases or decreases in size, various parts become modified; thus, with pigeons the ribs increase or decrease in number and breadth. Homologous parts which are identical during their early development and are exposed to similar conditions, tend to vary in the same or in some connected manner,--as {{in the case of}} the right and left sides of the body, and of the front and hind limbs. So it is with the organs of sight and hearing; for instance, white cats with blue eyes are almost always deaf. There is a manifest relation throughout the body between the skin and various dermal appendages, such as hair, feathers, hoofs, horns, and teeth. In Paraguay, horses with curly hair have hoofs like those of a mule; the wool and the horns of sheep often vary together; hairless dogs are deficient in their teeth; men with redundant hair have abnormal teeth, either by deficiency or excess. Birds with long wing-feathers usually have long tail-feathers. When long feathers grow from the outside of the legs and toes of pigeons, the two outer toes are connected by membrane; for the <b>whole</b> <b>leg</b> tends to assume the structure of the wing. There is a manifest relation between a crest of feathers on the head and a marvellous amount of change in the skull of various fowls; and in a lesser degree, between the greatly elongated, lopping ears of rabbits and the structure of their skulls. With plants, the leaves, various parts of the flower, and the fruit, often vary together to a correlated manner.|$|E
