5|$|After all the {{interviews}} concluded, {{the group of}} 208 men were convicted in summary courts-martial of disobeying orders, Article 4 of the Articles for the Government of the United States Navy (Rocks and Shoals). Each man was subject to forfeiture of three months' pay. A few of them were held as <b>witnesses</b> <b>in</b> the upcoming mutiny trial. The rest were split into smaller groups and shipped out to various places in the Pacific Theater. Carl Tuggle, one of the 208, said in 1998 {{that a group of}} prisoners including himself were assigned menial tasks such as cleaning latrines and picking up cigarette butts at a series of Pacific islands. After returning from active duty they each received bad conduct discharges, which meant the loss of virtually all veterans' benefits.|$|E

Property could not be taken for public use without the owner's consent, and a citizen could only be bound by a law accepted by that person or by elected representatives.

5|$|General Robert C. Oaks, USAF, Commander of United States Air Forces in Europe, {{immediately}} appointed an Air Force Regulation (AFR) 110-14 {{accident investigation}} board composed of a board president, 11 board members from the USAF and U.S. Army, three associate members from France, Turkey, and the United Kingdom, four legal advisers, and 13 technical advisers. The board president was Major General James G. Andrus, USAF. An AFR 110-14 investigation's findings are publicly released and the testimony of <b>witnesses</b> <b>in</b> the investigation can be used against them in military disciplinary proceedings. For this reason, after serious mishaps the USAF usually also conducts a separate safety investigation, in which the results are not publicly released and witness testimony is immune from prosecution. In this case, however, for unknown reasons the USAF decided not to conduct a safety investigation.|$|E

5|$|It is {{believed}} that initial investigations into the treatment of Afghan detainees sparked investigations into Canada's elite military unit, Joint Task Force 2 (JTF2). The first investigation, named Sand Trap, examined allegations that a JTF2 member {{was involved in the}} 2006 shooting death of an Afghan who was surrendering. No charges were laid {{at the conclusion of the}} investigation. However, a larger investigation called Sand Trap II began hearing from <b>witnesses</b> <b>in</b> May 2009 regarding allegations of JTF2 members witnessing United States armed forces killing an unarmed man. This investigation is still being conducted by the Canadian Forces National Investigation Service, and it has led to calls for civilian oversight of JTF2.|$|E
5|$|It {{was found}} that Choor Singh had two private {{contacts}} with a material witness {{in the course of}} the disciplinary proceedings, even though it is a well-established rule that a decision-maker should not have contact with any party to the proceedings or any of his <b>witnesses</b> <b>in</b> the absence of the other party or his counsel. The High Court found that there was no actual bias, but there was evidence on which reasonable people might believe that Choor Singh might or could not bring an unprejudiced mind to the disciplinary inquiry. The key finding was that the two private contacts with the material witness gave an appearance of a real likelihood of bias. On this basis, the High Court gave the order and quashed the finding of the disciplinary committee. The case was reported as Re Singh Kalpanath (1992).|$|E
