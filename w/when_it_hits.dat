5|$|One {{particular}} FFR attack, Poison Kiss, has her blow a large heart-shaped kiss at {{the opponent}} that travels in a sine wave path. If it connects, a quick peep show of Poison in several erotic poses is displayed, and afterwards the opponent is shown stunned with hearts dancing over their head. Defeating an opponent with this attack results in Poison doing a pole dance for her win pose, with her whip {{serving as the}} pole. Though not playable in the beta test of Capcom Fighting All Stars, promotional material released by Capcom for the title show that this move would have been retained for her gameplay. However, in Ultra Street Fighter IV, her Poison Kiss follows up with several slaps and a groin kick <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> the opponent, similar to her Cross Art move from Street Fighter X Tekken.|$|E
5|$|Jerry, Elaine, George and Kramer {{discuss the}} {{situation}} and Kramer urges Jerry {{to do something about}} it, but Elaine argues that Rava will no longer let her edit her book if Jerry does this. Jerry calls Ray and has lunch with him, while George sits in the next booth and eavesdrops on their conversation. Jerry and George asks him about the statue, but Ray gets offended and leaves when he hears their opinion. Elaine and Rava get into an argument about Jerry's accusation, and Elaine is no longer allowed to edit Rava's book. Without notifying anybody, Kramer dresses up in Irving's old clothes and goes to Ray's apartment, pretending to be a cop, and recovers the statue, despite Ray's protests. Kramer returns the statue to a grateful George. But while George is holding the statue, Kramer gives him a friendly pat on the back, causing George to drop the statue, which breaks <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> the floor. The episode ends without ever revealing whether or not Ray had in fact stolen the statue from Jerry's apartment.|$|E

25|$|The modern {{shoreline}} {{is composed}} of basalt lava flows. In the south, near Duluth, other materials, such as slate, greywacke and sandstone, are found a short distance inland; however in the north, the entire bedrock made of basalt and gabbro is exposed in patches miles from shore. When the bedrock hits {{the surface of the}} lake at a shallow enough angle, the beach is covered with washed up rocks. <b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> the lake at a steep angle, it breaks off and makes sharp cliffs ending at the lake.|$|E
25|$|Seam bowling is the act {{of using}} the seam of the ball to cause the ball to bounce in an {{unpredictable}} fashion <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> the pitch. A good batsman {{will be able to}} predict where a ball is going to bounce and from that work out what height the ball will be when it reaches him or her. By generating variations in bounce, the bowler can make it more likely the batsman will make a mistake in his assessment of the ball and give away their wicket.|$|E

25|$|Roll forging is {{a process}} where round or flat bar stock is reduced in {{thickness}} and increased in length. Roll forging is performed using two cylindrical or semi-cylindrical rolls, each containing one or more shaped grooves. A heated bar is inserted into the rolls and <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> a spot the rolls rotate and the bar is progressively shaped as it is rolled through the machine. The piece is then transferred to {{the next set of}} grooves or turned around and reinserted into the same grooves. This continues until the desired shape and size is achieved. The advantage of this process is there is no flash and it imparts a favorable grain structure into the workpiece.|$|E
25|$|A ball {{rotating}} {{around the}} seam will move either {{right or left}} <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> the pitch, depending on which way the ball is spinning. A ball bouncing to the right {{is said to be}} an off cutter as it is travelling from off stump to leg stump for a right-handed batsman. Conversely, a ball that bounces to the left is a leg cutter, travelling from leg to off stump for a right-handed batsman. Cutters are usually aimed so that they hit the pitch just outside the batsman's off stump and move away from the wicket. This will cause the ball to catch the outside edge of the bat instead of the middle and fly up to be caught in the slips.|$|E

Slaton interviewed others and conducted his own tests on his visit to the factory, concluding that every time the elevator made the trip to the basement it touched the bottom. Slaton said, [...] "If the elevator was not used by Conley and Frank in taking the body to the basement, then the explanation of Conley cannot be accepted." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} played only once and {{received}} minor treatments afterwards, {{with the addition}} of a cello part in the introduction and some editing, which included removing a verse to reduce the song's length. Eno was outraged that U2 wanted to shorten the song, and he was adamant that the band not alter the original track too much, saying, [...] "These fucking guys, they're supposed to be so spiritual—they don't spot a miracle <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> them in the face. Nothing like that ever happened to me in the studio in my whole life." [...] The band's original concept for No Line on the Horizon was to create an album of future hymns—songs that would be played forever. According to Eno and Lanois, [...] "Moment of Surrender" [...] is the closest the band came to reaching that concept.|$|E

[...] Games Radar placed Lords of Shadow at number 26 for 100 Most Anticipated Games of 2010, stating that [...] "This could be a megaton release." [...] 1UP.com's top 50 most anticipated games of E3 2010 ranked Lords of Shadow at number 17. Despite the heavy anticipation, Cox noted {{there was still a}} small number of fans who did not like the game's transition to the 3D format. He stated, [...] "Fair enough, some people aren't going to like what we're doing and we accept that but generally what we're trying to do is bring the fans with us ... there's no point in going back and making the same game again – the point is to make a clean break and move forward with the series." ...|$|E
500|$|April 4 {{also saw}} the {{announcement}} of two new downloadable content packs for the coming weeks: an [...] "Orrery" [...] quest that would see gamers setting out to repair a Dwarven Orrery; and a [...] "Wizard's Tower" [...] that would offer a new home for player characters, complete with the capacity to grow herbs, summon atronachs, and make spells. 1UP predicted that, given Bethesda's response to customer criticism, those releases would be somewhat more substantial than the [...] "Horse Armor" [...] release was. On April 7, Bethesda priced the [...] "Orrery". Offering what GameSpot called [...] "more bang for less buck", Bethesda set the PC release price at US$1.89, and the Xbox 360 release price at 150 Marketplace points, equivalent to US$1.88. Joystiq offered their support—"'Big ups'"—to the company for the new price. [...] "Although we passed on the $2.50 horse armor this week, we'll definitely be messin' with that Orrery device <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> the Marketplace." [...] The pack was eventually released on April 17. Also on April 7, EB Games and GameStop began offering a coupon promising one free download of the [...] "Horse Armor" [...] pack with every purchase of the PC edition of Oblivion. The [...] "Wizard's Tower", called the [...] "Frostcrag Spire" [...] in-game, was released on April 24 for the same price as the [...] "Orrery".|$|E

500|$|Brian Lowry of Variety {{positively}} {{wrote that}} the finale [...] "ignored" [...] the last few seasons' missteps and was [...] "awash in warmth and inside gags". He concluded that the show [...] "deserved to finish on top", and that {{while some of the}} scenes, such as Dwight's wedding seemed [...] "a little bit trite", the resulting product was successful. Michael Tedder of Vulture awarded the episode five stars out of five and {{wrote that the}} episode was able to provide solid conclusions for all of the characters. Erik Adams of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an [...] "A–" [...] and wrote that [...] "the quality of this series finale is found in the way it functions right now, in the afterglow of a TV show to which many devoted more than 100 hours of their lives.

Tom Gliatto of People magazine, however, gave the episode a negative review, and wrote that [...] "this episode was poorly conceived and clumsily structured.

500|$|According to MTV News, {{the song}} [...] "touches on Drake {{reaction}} to fame and stardom". Drake told MTV News, that {{the song was}} [...] "definitely" [...] a choice of his for releasing as a single, {{and that it was}} a song he did for himself. [...] Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly called the song, [...] "a prideful track about a guy who fought for notoriety, gained it, and now struggles with what comes with it: criticism, groupies, and the pressure of expected greatness." [...] The song makes heavy use of an orchestral backdrop, while Drake delivers confident, aggressive raps in a paced fashion. Drake makes references to film critics Roger Ebert & Richard Roeper, as well as actress Jada Pinkett Smith and her 1996 film, Set It Off. According to Michael Craggg of MusicOMH, the song contains three hooks. Several lines in the second verse are actually a flip of hip-hop group Dead Prez's [...] "Hip-Hop", from their 2000 debut, Let's Get Free. Ironically, Dead Prez's track is meant as a jab at media controlled artists like Drake, stating, [...] "One thing about music <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> you feel no pain/ White folks say it controls your brain/ I know better than that/ It's just game", to which Drake stated when asked about it, [...] "I love that flow. So I took that flow and flipped it in the second verse." [...] He also references Michael Jackson's iconic attire in his [...] "Thriller" [...] video, though the lines, [...] "'Bout to go 'Thriller' Mike Jackson on these niggas/ All I need is a fucking red jacket with some zippers." [...] On the reference, Drake said, [...] "That was sort of my reference point; that phenomenon of Michael. He was young and had the world excited and anticipating his every move. That was my homage to him and the impact that he had on the world that I live in. It's also ... great for people to say. Especially, unfortunately what happened to him, just to honor him was great." ...|$|E

Players use various grips during play, including the Continental (The [...] "Handshake Grip"), Eastern (Can be either semi-eastern or full eastern.
