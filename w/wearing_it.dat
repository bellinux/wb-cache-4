5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1851, women in several states were wearing the dress in public. In March, Amelia Bloomer, editor of the temperance {{newspaper}} The Lily, announced that she was <b>wearing</b> <b>it</b> and printed a description of her dress along with {{instructions on how to}} make it. Soon, newspapers had dubbed it the “Bloomer dress”, and the name stuck.|$|E

5|$|A $1 million {{insurance}} policy was secured against the diamond with Lloyd's of London. The terms set by Lloyd's stipulated {{that it could}} only be publicly worn for thirty days in any given year, that it be stored in a vault, and that Taylor was to be accompanied by armed guards when <b>wearing</b> <b>it</b> in public. Taylor would later have a replica made of the diamond that cost $2,800.|$|E

5|$|Avoiding {{stereotypes}} and labeling {{based on personal}} dress, the program uses polo shirts, t-shirts, and other articles of clothing like neckerchiefs as uniforms. Participants uniforms display the White Stag logo, which is a visible reminder of the program's founding vision articulated by Baden-Powell {{at the conclusion of}} the 1933 World Jamboree. The uniform reminds the individual <b>wearing</b> <b>it</b> of their commitment to the program's values. It instills self-esteem in the person and pride in the program. It eliminates class and socio-economic distinctions. Wearing a uniform improves member's behavior and lessens the impact on a person's personal wardrobe.|$|E
5|$|ILC did {{not produce}} apparel for adults until the {{introduction}} of the Living Girdle in 1940, after patenting a method of manufacturing latex girdles that would not tear at the seams if they had a small tear or hole. The Living Girdle was advertised with images of mobility and comfort, such as women playing tennis or leaping while <b>wearing</b> <b>it,</b> though the solid rubber girdle was actually very uncomfortable.|$|E

5|$|Some pundits {{have argued}} that the top was not in fact Cobb's totem, {{rendering}} the discussion irrelevant. They say that the top was Mal's totem; Cobb's was his wedding ring, as he can be seen <b>wearing</b> <b>it</b> whenever he is in a dream and without it whenever he isn't. As he hands his passport to the immigration officer, his hand is shown with no ring; thus he was conclusively in reality when seeing his children. Furthermore, the children were portrayed by different actors, indicating they had aged.|$|E
5|$|The ao dai {{is now a}} {{standard}} for weddings, for celebrating Tết and for other formal occasions. It's the required uniform for female teachers (mostly {{from high school to}} below) and female students in common high schools in the South; there is no requirement for color or pattern for teachers while students use plain white with some small patterns like flowers for school uniform. Companies often require their female staff to wear uniforms that include the ao dai, so flight attendants, receptionists, bank female staff, restaurant staff, and hotel workers in Vietnam may be seen <b>wearing</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|After several {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts to}} destroy the Horcrux, the trio take turns <b>wearing</b> <b>it</b> to dilute its power. Harry sees a vision of Voldemort interrogating and killing the wand-maker Gregorovitch, who claims that a teenage boy had once stolen the legendary Elder Wand from his shop. While Ron is wearing the locket, he is overcome by negative feelings and argues with Harry before leaving him and Hermione behind. Hermione deduces that the sword of Gryffindor can destroy Horcruxes and decides with Harry to go to Godric's Hollow. They visit Harry's parents' graves and the house where they were killed. They encounter Bathilda Bagshot, who they believe may have the sword. Bathilda lets Harry and Hermione into her house, and is revealed to actually be Nagini, controlling Bathilda's reanimated corpse from inside of her. Hermione and Harry escape into the Forest of Dean, but Hermione accidentally breaks Harry's wand whilst fighting Nagini. Hermione is then {{able to identify the}} mysterious thief seen in Harry's vision as Gellert Grindelwald.|$|E

5000|$|The NSW Teachers Federation {{supports}} <b>Wear</b> <b>it</b> Purple Day, {{but some}} schools have received {{criticism in the}} face of celebrating <b>Wear</b> <b>it</b> Purple Day. Cheltenham Girls’ High School principal Susan Bridge received letters from parents about their disagreement with the introduction of the overarching national framework of Safe Schools, which included [...] "...theme days at the school such as <b>Wear</b> <b>it</b> Purple Day...". Miranda Devine alleged that the celebration of <b>Wear</b> <b>it</b> Purple Day at Cheltenham Girls' High School caused [...] "...some students... to ...feel marginalised and excluded if they do not embrace the ideology.", with MP Damien Tudehope adding that students are [...] "ostracised" [...] if they do not support [...] "Purple Day" [...] sic. David Phillips, then-National Director of FamilyVoice Australia, gave evidence to the Australian Parliament's Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee, that students were vilified and bullied if they upheld the traditional definition of marriage and chose not to participate in <b>Wear</b> <b>it</b> Purple Day.|$|R
5|$|Echols {{recalled}} {{that the first}} scenes shot were those of Madonna walking down Lenox Avenue. While filming, the singer noticed a black leather coat with fur trim, worn by Fatima, the assistant director. Madonna asked for the coat from Fatima and ended up <b>wearing</b> <b>it</b> in the video. Echols also noted that Madonna had {{a close relationship with}} the cinematographer, and knew from which angle her shots would be the best and which lights to be used. After the misunderstandings regarding looks and the plot direction were cleared, the filming resumed and was finished within three days. The final scenes were with model Jason Olive in a Marlem house, with Madonna climbing steps and reaching him and their supposed child.|$|E
5|$|In January 2015, DeWitt {{announced}} plans for the Cardinals to renovate a baseball field in Sosúa in Taveras's honor, modeled after the Cardinals Care facilities in Greater St. Louis. The team would also wear black circular patches inscribed with OT (Taveras's initials) inside a white circle on their jerseys. The patch will omit Taveras's No. 18 because Martínez is already <b>wearing</b> <b>it</b> as his uniform number as a tribute. A large decal in his memorial was posted in the home team bullpen of Busch Stadium along with the ones of Hancock and former pitcher Darryl Kile, who died of coronary artery disease during the 2002 season while still active.|$|E
5|$|Mandarin square: Mandarin squares {{were large}} {{embroidered}} badges sewn onto the surcoat of an officials in Imperial China, Korea and Vietnam. It was embroidered with detailed, colourful animal or bird insignia indicating {{the rank of}} the official <b>wearing</b> <b>it.</b> Mandarin squares were first authorized for wear in 1391 by the Ming Dynasty. The use of squares depicting birds for civil officials and animals for military officials was {{an outgrowth of the}} use of similar squares, apparently for decorative use, in the Yuan Dynasty. The original court dress regulations of the Ming Dynasty were published in 1368, but did not refer to badges as rank insignia.|$|E

50|$|Newell {{presented}} an event {{about the film}} at her alumnus, Burwood Girls High School (also attended by co-founder of <b>Wear</b> <b>it</b> Purple Day, Katherine Hudson). Up to 50 Australian schools including 20 in NSW had organised a simultaneous broadcast of the film on <b>Wear</b> <b>it</b> Purple Day.|$|R
50|$|This white {{mark was}} unlike the one worn by a Hindu of Vaishnavism {{tradition}} who <b>wore</b> <b>it</b> {{on the forehead}} {{in the shape of}} 'U', or of Saivism tradition who <b>wore</b> <b>it</b> horizontally as three parallel lines. This Thirunamam is also called as Tottu Namam and Thiruman.|$|R
5|$|The George III Fringe Tiara is a circlet {{incorporating}} brilliant diamonds {{that were}} formerly owned by George III. Originally commissioned in 1830, the tiara has been worn by many queens consort. Originally, {{it could be}} worn as a collar or necklace or mounted on a wire to form the tiara. Queen Victoria wore it as a tiara {{during a visit to}} the Royal Opera in 1839. In Franz Xaver Winterhalter's painting The First of May, completed in 1851, Victoria can be seen <b>wearing</b> <b>it</b> as she holds Prince Arthur, the future Duke of Connaught and Strathearn. In a veiled reference to the adoration of the Magi, the Duke of Wellington is seen presenting the young prince with a gift.|$|E
5|$|The squad's {{tactical}} plan was upset {{on the first}} day, when a breakaway that included LeMond's teammate Ronan Pensec, but no major favorites, arrived ten minutes ahead of the field. LeMond was prevented from challenging for the lead until the yellow jersey left the shoulders of teammate Ronan Pensec. LeMond closed in on race leader Claudio Chiappucci, finally overtaking him in the final individual time trial on stage 20, where he finished over two minutes ahead of the unheralded Italian. LeMond at last had the yellow jersey, <b>wearing</b> <b>it</b> the following day as the Tour rode into Paris. LeMond had the distinction of winning the 1990 Tour without taking any of the individual stages. He remains the last rider to win the Tour while wearing the world champion jersey. Over {{the course of the}} 1990 Tour the perceived strength of the Z team was confirmed, as they led the team classification through most of the race, adding the team title to LeMond's yellow jersey.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{producers}} decided that Friday the 13th {{would not be}} an origin story, they said that they wanted to work out a logical origin story for Jason that would provide a sense of history as the film progressed. Form and Fuller explained that the audience gets to see how Jason attains his famous hockey mask, and is given a reason for why he puts it on. Jason would transition from wearing a bag over his head—similar to the one seen in Friday the 13th Part 2—to finding and wearing his hockey mask, whereas in Friday the 13th Part III he obtains the mask off-screen and comes out of a barn already <b>wearing</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{crinoline}} {{needed to}} be rigid enough to support the skirts in their accustomed shape, but also flexible enough to be temporarily pressed out of shape and spring back afterwards. Other materials used for crinolines included whalebone, gutta-percha and vulcanised caoutchouc (natural rubber). The idea of inflatable hoops was short-lived as they were easily punctured, prone to collapse, and due {{to the use of}} brimstone in the manufacture of rubber, they smelled unpleasant. Although hard rubber hoops of gutta-percha worked satisfactorily at first, they were brittle and easily crushed without recovering their form. Despite objections that the sharp points of snapped steels were hazardous, lightweight steel was clearly the most successful option. It reduced the number of petticoats and their weight, and offered increased freedom of movement of the legs. However, hasty or careless movements in a hoop skirt could lead to accidentally revealing more than intended. An advertisement published in The Lady's Newspaper in 1863 for a cage crinoline with waved hoops attempted to reassure the potential customer that while <b>wearing</b> <b>it,</b> activities such as climbing stairs, passing to her theatre seat, dropping into armchairs and leaning against furniture would be possible without hindrance either to herself or to others around her.|$|E
