5|$|Augustus {{bestowed}} only {{properties and}} possessions to his designated heirs, as an obvious system of institutionalized imperial inheritance would have provoked resistance and hostility among the republican-minded Romans fearful of monarchy. With {{regards to the}} Principate, {{it was obvious to}} Augustus that Marcellus <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> take on his position; nonetheless, by giving his signet ring to Agrippa, Augustus intended to signal to the legions that Agrippa was to be his successor, and that constitutional procedure notwithstanding, they should continue to obey Agrippa.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin's {{loneliness}} {{was relieved}} when he met 21-year-old actress Paulette Goddard in July 1932, and the pair began a successful relationship. He <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> commit to a film, however, and focused on writing a serial about his travels (published in Woman's Home Companion). The trip had been a stimulating experience for Chaplin, including meetings with several prominent thinkers, and he became increasingly interested in world affairs. The state of labour in America troubled him, and he feared that capitalism and machinery in the workplace would increase unemployment levels. It was these concerns that stimulated Chaplin to develop his new film.|$|E

After pitching in a few simulated games, Richard was placed on the 40-man active roster on September 1, 1981. Astros manager Bill Virdon thought Richard <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> return, so Richard did not pitch with the team during the last two months of the season.|$|E

However, the second prototype continued flight testing until 12 July 1946 when an engine fire forced an emergency landing and it was damaged beyond repair.|$|E
5|$|The Montreal Forum, {{which in}} later decades became {{synonymous with the}} Canadiens, was opened in 1924 to house the {{expansion}} Montreal Maroons. The Canadiens were invited to inaugurate the arena as the natural ice surface at the Mount Royal Arena <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> host NHL games. The team played the first game in Forum history on November 29, 1924, a 7–1 victory over the Toronto St. Patricks. The Canadiens took residence at the Forum in 1926, sharing it with the Maroons until the latter ceased operations in 1938.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} Graham was {{discharged}} from the Navy late {{in the summer of}} 1946, training camp for Brown's new team, the Cleveland Browns, had already begun. Concerned that Graham <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> start, Brown put in Cliff Lewis at quarterback in {{the first game of the}} season. Graham, however, soon replaced Lewis in Brown's T formation offense. Handing the ball to fullback Marion Motley and throwing to ends Dante Lavelli and Mac Speedie, Graham led the team to a 12–2 regular-season record and a spot in the championship game against the AAFC's New York Yankees. The Browns won that game, touching off a period of dominance. The team won each of the AAFC's four championships between 1946 and 1949, and had professional football's second perfect season in 1948 by finishing undefeated and untied.|$|E
5|$|Khánh's deposal of {{the prime}} {{minister}} nullified a counter-plot involving Hương, which had developed during the civil disorders that forced him from office. In an attempt to pre-empt his deposal, Hương had backed a plot led by some Dai Viet-oriented Catholic officers, reported to include Generals Thiệu and Nguyễn Hữu Có. They planned to remove Khánh and bring Khiêm back from Washington. The US Embassy in Saigon was privately supportive of the aim, but <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> give full support. They regarded it as poorly thought out and potentially a political embarrassment due to the need to use an American plane to transport some plotters, including Khiêm, between Saigon and Washington. As a result, the Deputy Ambassador U. Alexis Johnson only promised asylum for Hương if the plot failed.|$|E
5|$|Lee's {{plan for}} July 2 called for Longstreet {{to attack the}} Union's left flank, which would be {{followed}} up by Hill's attack on Cemetery Ridge near the center, while Ewell demonstrated on the Union right.

Law's brigade (Hood's division) to reach the field before he advanced any of his other brigades; Law marched his men quickly, covering 28 miles in eleven hours, but did not arrive until noon. Three of Longstreet's brigades were still in march column, and {{some distance from the}} attack positions they would need to reach. All of Longstreet's divisions were forced to take a long detour while approaching the enemy position, misled by inadequate reconnaissance that failed to identify a completely concealed route.|$|E

5|$|Like a Virgin is {{the second}} studio album by American singer and {{songwriter}} Madonna, released on November 12, 1984, by Sire Records. Following the success of her self-titled debut album, Madonna wanted to become the record producer of her next album. However, her label <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> give her the artistic freedom and she chose Nile Rodgers instead to produce the album due to his work with David Bowie. Madonna wrote six songs on the record, five of which feature Steve Bray as a co-writer. The album was recorded at Power Station Studio in New York at a quick pace. Rodgers {{enlisted the help of}} his former Chic bandmates Bernard Edwards, who was the bassist, and Tony Thompson, who played drums. Jason Corsaro, the record's audio engineer, persuaded Rodgers to use digital recording, a new technique introduced at that time.|$|E
5|$|On December 12, 2001, Ryder {{was arrested}} on {{shoplifting}} charges in Beverly Hills, California. She was accused of stealing $5,500 worth of designer clothes and accessories at a Saks Fifth Avenue department store. In the security offices of the store, before Ryder was arrested by the Los Angeles Police Department, she signed two civil demands that bound her {{to pay for the}} stolen and surrendered merchandise, as permitted under California's Statute for Civil Recovery for Shoplifting. Los Angeles District Attorney Stephen Cooley produced a team of eight prosecutors, and filed four felony charges against her. Ryder hired noted celebrity defense attorney Mark Geragos. Negotiations for a plea bargain failed at the end of summer 2002. As noted by Joel Mowbray from National Review, the prosecution <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> offer the actress an open door to a no-contest plea on misdemeanor charges.|$|E

During a press conference on November 19, 2014, Místico announced that he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> return to the ring, {{which led to the}} CMLL World Welterweight Championship being declared vacant. On December 26, 2014, CMLL held a 10-man Torneo cibernetico elimination match to determine the next champion. Negro Casas and Máscara Dorada outlasted the other eight competitors; Delta, Fuego, Kamaitachi, Pólvora, Rey Cometa, Sangre Azteca, Titán and Tritón.

5|$|Entering April, the Capitals had {{a chance}} to clinch a playoff spot against the Tampa Bay Lightning. The game was tied 2–2 with 1:03 {{remaining}} when Steven Stamkos scored, leading Tampa to the eventual 4–2 victory. Facing the Division-leading Panthers in their next game, Washington succeeded in clinching a playoff spot with a 4–2 win of their own. The victory also gave the Capitals a chance at winning their Division in their final game. During the game, Neuvirth was hurt when former Capital Marco Sturm fell on top of him while he was making a save. Neuvirth left after the incident and did not return. Neuvirth suffered a lower body injury and <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> return for the final game or the start of the playoffs. Washington won its final game of the year behind a 35-save performance from Holtby, clinching at least the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference pending the outcome of Florida’s game. A win by the Panthers in their final game, however, prevented Washington from winning their fifth-straight Division title and moving into the third playoff seed.|$|E
5|$|Following the Australian Open loss, del Potro missed several tournaments, {{including}} the Masters tournaments at Indian Wells and Miami, which were touted as potential return dates, {{due to the}} persistent wrist injury. Even though he withdrew from the Monte-Carlo Rolex Masters, he regained the world No. 4 ranking, due to Murray's early exit in the second round. He then withdrew from Barcelona and the Rome Masters. On 4 May, del Potro took the option of having an operation to fix the injury. On 19 May, del Potro {{said he would not}} defend his US Open title, but if all went well, he would appear after the event, targeting the Paris Masters as a possible comeback. However, on 22 July, the USTA stated that del Potro was expected to defend his US Open crown. The player himself confirmed that his comeback to the tour would be the Thailand Open and said nothing about the New York event. On 2 August, del Potro returned to the practice courts.

5|$|However, {{by the end}} of the year, the United States {{had failed}} to achieve the {{objectives}} of Rolling Thunder, because North Vietnam continued to send its troops and military supplies down the Ho Chi Minh Trail, which demonstrated that the North Vietnamese Government <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> quit the war. In response to domestic political pressure to do more, President Johnson shifted priority of the campaign to interdiction. From summer 1965 to the winter period of 1966–67, the campaign was aimed at degrading North Vietnam’s capability to infiltrate and send men into South Vietnam. Again, America’s shift towards interdiction also failed, and the Johnson administration was forced to change the priority of the bombing campaign. For the third phase of Rolling Thunder, which occurred from spring 1967 to early 1968, bombing operations were focused on industrial and transportation targets in and around Hanoi, Hai Phong and the buffer zone near the Chinese border.|$|E

However, Skanderbeg had remained in Albania but he had sent twelve ships with many inhabitants of Krujë to Italy as refugees. With them, he sent his wife, Donika, and his son, John. They were headed to Monte Sant'Angelo, a castle awarded to Skanderbeg after his campaigns to restore Ferdinand's rule. The arrival of Albanian refugees further distressed the pope and many Italians {{who had come to}} believe that Albania had been conquered and that Mehmed was now preparing to march into Italy. News to the contrary also reached Rome saying that the League of Lezhë had not been broken and that Krujë still stood.|$|E
