5|$|In 1993, Dave Raggett, then at Hewlett-Packard (HP) in Bristol, England {{devoted his}} spare time to {{developing}} Arena on which he hoped to demonstrate new and future HTML specifications. Development of the browser was slow because Raggett was the lone developer and HP, which like many other computer corporations at the time, was unconvinced that the Internet would succeed and thus did not consider investing in web browser development. Raggett demonstrated the browser at the first World Wide <b>Web</b> <b>Conference</b> in Geneva, Switzerland in 1994 and the 1994 ISOC conference in Prague to show text flow around images, forms, {{and other aspects of}} HTML later termed as the HTML+ specification. Raggett subsequently partnered with CERN, to develop Arena further as a proof of concept browser for this work. Using the Arena browser, Dave Raggett, Henrik Frystyk Nielsen, Håkon Wium Lie and others demonstrated text flow around a figure with captions, resizable tables, image backgrounds, HTML math, and other features. At the Web World conference in Orlando, in early 1995, Raggett demonstrated the different new features of Arena.|$|E

40|$|AbstractVideo {{teleconferencing}} and <b>web</b> <b>conferencing</b> are two {{alternative methods}} of distance course delivery. This study addressed students’ attitude towards these methods of course delivery. A course of sterilization and disinfection {{was delivered to}} operation room technology students using different methods, including face-to-face learning, video teleconferencing and <b>Web</b> <b>conferencing.</b> At {{the end of the}} semester, students’ attitude towards each of these methods was obtained using a questionnaire. 88. 5 % of students preferred face to face learning. Comparing the two methods of virtual learning, 71. 5 % of students believed to more effective learning through <b>web</b> <b>conferencing.</b> In terms of being more attractive, 65. 2 % of student preferred <b>web</b> <b>conferencing.</b> Regarding ease of communication with the teacher, the satisfaction rate was 69. 5 % for <b>web</b> <b>conferencing.</b> 55. 5 % expressed that the teacher would have more control over the class through the <b>Web</b> <b>conferencing.</b> So, among the two methods of virtual course delivery, students significantly preferred <b>Web</b> <b>conferencing...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Web</b> <b>conferencing,</b> a {{technology}} once {{available only to}} companies with larger budgets, is now becoming more mainstream due to advances in technology and fierce market competition. In all educational settings (face-to-face, hybrid, and distance learning), this technology {{has the potential to}} engage learners and improve learning. However, how does a school choose from the burgeoning array of <b>Web</b> <b>conferencing</b> tools and applications that are offered? And a software solution is chosen, how can <b>Web</b> <b>conferencing</b> be used to enhance student learning? These questions are addressed in this article, which includes comprehensive information about a powerful <b>Web</b> <b>conferencing</b> system, Microsoft Live Meeting 2007. <b>Web</b> <b>Conferencing</b> <b>Web</b> <b>conferencing</b> is sometimes confused with video conferencing, but is significantly different. <b>Web</b> <b>conferencing</b> systems allow participants to communicate in real time with simply a personal computer, an Internet connection, and optional microphone and Web camera (webcam). These systems can accommodate both synchronous and asynchronous communication and can create powerful virtual learning environments that closely approximate face-to-face experiences (Foreman and Jenkins 2005). Participants can access and attend these online meetings through a standard Internet browser (although some <b>Web</b> <b>conferencing</b> software also requires participants to download plug-ins before they can access the meeting) ...|$|R
