3000|$|The {{first step}} in the test {{assembly}} is to determine the number of blocks and the assignment of items to those blocks. The function block_design facilitates this process with two required arguments and one optional argument. The n_blocks argument specifies the number of blocks while the item_parameters argument takes a data frame of item parameters. The default allocation of items to blocks is a spiraling design. For 1, 2, [...]..., H item blocks, the first item <b>is</b> <b>assigned</b> to block 1, item 2 <b>is</b> <b>assigned</b> to the block 2, and item H <b>is</b> <b>assigned</b> to block H. The process is continued such that item H+ 1 <b>is</b> <b>assigned</b> to block 1, item H+ 2 <b>is</b> <b>assigned</b> to block 2 and item H+H <b>is</b> <b>assigned</b> to block H until all items <b>are</b> <b>assigned</b> to a block.|$|R
