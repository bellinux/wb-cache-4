5|$|Despite his {{popularity}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> the Arab world, by mid-1957 his only regional ally was Syria. In September, Turkish troops massed along the Syrian border, giving credence to {{rumors that the}} Baghdad Pact countries were attempting to topple Syria's leftist government. Nasser sent a contingent force to Syria as a symbolic display of solidarity, further elevating his prestige in the Arab world, and particularly among Syrians.|$|E
5|$|Forster's {{attitude}} {{brought him}} into conflict <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> the different nations he encountered and made him welcome nowhere, as he was too revolutionary and antinational for Germans, proud and opposing in his dealings with Englishmen, too unconcerned about Polish science for Poles, and too insignificant politically and ignored while in France.|$|E

5|$|Boston's British {{military}} leaders, General Thomas Gage and Admiral Samuel Graves, {{both had}} reason to do business <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> Machias. Gage required lumber to build barracks for the additional troops arriving in the besieged city. Graves wanted to recover the guns from the HMS Halifax shipwreck, which been intentionally run aground in Machias Bay by a local pilot in February 1775. The ship's guns were reported to {{be of interest to}} the Patriots of Machias. Graves authorized Ichabod Jones, a Tory Machias merchant, to take flour and other food supplies aboard his ships Unity and Polly to exchange for Gage's needed lumber. To guarantee that this trade would happen, Graves sent James Moore, a midshipman from his flagship HMS Preston, to command the armed schooner Margaretta and accompany the two merchant vessels. Moore had additional orders to retrieve what he could from the wreck site of the HMS Halifax.|$|E
5|$|Information {{is largely}} absent {{regarding}} any major administrative changes Salih {{made to the}} Emirate of Aleppo. His only known institutional innovation was the post of shaykh al-dawla (chieftain of the state) or raʾīs al-balad (municipal chief), who served as Salih's trusted confidant and permanent representative <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> Aleppo. The post emulated that of the shaykh, who played a secondary role to an amīr in a princely Kilabi clan. The shaykh al-dawla played an important political role {{in the city and}} came from a prominent leading family. Salih assigned Ibn Mustafad to the post and utilized the aḥdāth, which consisted of young armed men from the city's lower and middle classes, as a police force. Although they cooperated with Salih, the aḥdāth were still an independent force. Sometime during his reign, Salih also acquired a number of Turkish ghilmān, though details about them are lacking in the sources.|$|E

5|$|The county {{facilities}} in the bailey were expanded during these years, with improvements to the Grand Jury House and the Common Hall, but by the 1680s {{the role of the}} military garrison at York Castle was being called into question. Sir Christopher Musgrave produced a report for the Crown in 1682; he argued that it would cost at least £30,000 to turn the castle into a modern fortification, producing a proposal for the six bastions that such a star fort would require. This work was never carried out. Meanwhile, the garrison and the castle had become extremely unpopular <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> York, who disliked both the cost and the imposition of external authority.|$|E
5|$|As archbishop, William {{undertook}} {{a number of}} ecclesiastical reforms, and became popular <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> York. However, he still needed a pallium, the sign of an archbishop's authority from the pope, which {{he had not yet}} received. The Cistercians, who were still adamantly opposed to his being archbishop, were determined to prevent his receiving it. William travelled to Rome in an attempt to obtain the pallium. The election of Pope Eugene III, a Cistercian, in 1145, was a setback for his cause. Bernard of Clairvaux, the famous Cistercian abbot and religious leader, exerted all his influence to ensure William's suspension, sending a series of complaints to the new pope that William had been intruded by secular powers into the see, that he was oppressing the Cistercian monasteries and that he had irregularly appointed William of St. Barbara as Dean of York. In the winter of 1145–46 Eugene re-examined the case, declared that William had not been validly consecrated, and suspended him from office. William was required to obtain an in-person refutation of the old charges by William of St. Barbara, who was now the Bishop of Durham.|$|E
