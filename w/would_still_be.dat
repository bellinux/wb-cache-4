5|$|Senator Arlen Specter in {{a severe}} rebuke of federal {{governmental}} policy, stated {{just one day}} after Kemp died of cancer, that Kemp <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> alive {{if the federal government}} had done a better job funding cancer research.|$|E
5|$|Written by Robert Holmes, this storyline was {{considered}} {{in the autumn of}} 1976 when it was assumed Hinchcliffe <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> producing Season 15. It was to have been inspired by Joseph Conrad's novel Heart of Darkness.|$|E
5|$|In February 2017, then-Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Chan Chun Sing {{said that}} if a {{minority}} candidate leaves their group representation constituency (GRC), a by-election will not be called. Chan claimed that the goals of having enough minority members in Parliament, and to ensure no political campaign on issues of race and religion, <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> met even if the minority member of the GRC left.|$|E

5|$|Specter {{criticized the}} federal {{government}}'s policy on cancer, stating {{the day after}} Jack Kemp—the 1996 Republican vice presidential nominee and former congressman—died of cancer, that Kemp <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> alive {{if the federal government}} had done a better job funding cancer research.|$|E
5|$|Although {{a distant}} planet such as Planet Nine would reflect little light, it <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> {{radiating}} {{the heat from}} its formation as it cools due to its large mass. At its estimated temperature of 47 K, the peak of its emissions would be at infrared wavelengths. This radiation signature could be detected by Earth-based infrared telescopes, such as ALMA, and a search could be conducted by cosmic microwave background experiments operating at mm wavelengths. Additionally, Jim Green of NASA is optimistic {{that it could be}} observed by the James Webb Space Telescope, the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, that is expected to be launched in 2019.|$|E
5|$|Blomkamp {{declared}} the project dead in late 2007, but Jackson replied {{that the film}} <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> made. Blomkamp and Jackson collaborated on District 9, but the director told /Film {{that he was no}} longer considering working on a Halo film if the opportunity arose, saying that after working on the film for five months before the project's collapse {{it would be difficult to}} return. The rights for the film have since reverted to Microsoft.|$|E

5|$|In April 2013, Nokia {{was granted}} a {{preliminary}} injunction in the Netherlands against STMicroelectronics, which had supplied HTC with microphone components for the device that contained Nokia’s proprietary technology. Despite the injunction being against STM, Nokia still used the injunction to publicly accuse HTC of copying technology from its products. HTC <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> {{able to use the}} remaining microphones it acquired in good faith; the offending component was replaced with an alternative version in future production runs.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the plutonium implosion-type nuclear weapon and the plutonium gun-type fission weapon, the uranium gun-type weapon was straightforward if not trivial to design. The concept was pursued so that {{in case of a}} failure to develop a plutonium bomb, it <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> possible to use the gun principle. The gun-type design henceforth had to work with enriched uranium only, and this allowed the Thin Man design to be greatly simplified. A high-velocity gun was no longer required, and a simpler weapon could be substituted. The simplified weapon was short enough to fit into a B-29 bomb bay.|$|E
5|$|Nikki is {{manipulative}} of Paulo {{and appears}} to care more about the diamonds than her relationship. After the crash, Paulo becomes suspicious Nikki is just using {{him to get the}} diamonds. The first thing she asks him after the crash is the whereabouts of the diamonds, and avoids answering Paulo when he asks if they <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> together if she did not need him to help find the diamonds. Paulo does what Nikki tells him to because of his fear of losing her, which results in their deaths.|$|E

5|$|Pending the Disney {{acquisition}} of Pixar, {{the two companies}} created a distribution deal for the intended 2007 release of Ratatouille, if the acquisition fell through, {{to ensure that this}} one film <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> released through Disney's distribution channels. In contrast to the earlier Pixar deal, Ratatouille was to remain a Pixar property and Disney would have received only a distribution fee. The completion of Disney's Pixar acquisition, however, nullified this distribution arrangement.|$|E
5|$|Pontecorvo {{created a}} neutron source using radium and beryllium, as the Via Panisperna boys had, with {{paraffin}} wax as a neutron moderator, and measured {{the absorption of}} different minerals using methods developed by Fermi and Amaldi. By June 1941, he had a device that could differentiate shale, limestone and sandstone, and map the transitions between them. The technique may be considered the first practical application {{of the discovery of}} slow neutrons, and <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> in use decades later for well logging. He filed four patents relating to his instrumentation.|$|E
5|$|Several laws {{dealt with}} indentured servitude, a legal status whereby {{a person would}} work off debts or be given {{training}} {{in exchange for a}} period of unrecompensed service. The law required that all indentured servants had to be registered by the Governor or one of the Assistants, and that no period of indenture could be less than six months. Further laws forbade a master from shortening the length of time of service required for his servant, and also confirmed that any indentured servants whose period of service began in England <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> required to complete their service while in Plymouth.|$|E

5|$|The cockroach's {{ability to}} {{withstand}} radiation better than {{human beings can}} be explained through the cell cycle. Cells are most vulnerable {{to the effects of}} radiation when they are dividing. A cockroach's cells divide only once each time it molts, which is weekly at most in a juvenile roach. Since not all cockroaches would be molting at the same time, many would be unaffected by an acute burst of radiation, but lingering radioactive fallout <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> harmful.|$|E
5|$|The final {{was held}} at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, which was Roma's home ground. UEFA decided that the match <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> played at the stadium, despite it being Roma's home ground. Therefore, the match was {{effectively}} a home match for them. The stadium was significant for Liverpool as well, as their victory in 1977 came at the ground. With home advantage Roma went into the match as favourites, and were 13–8 with bookmakers to win the match.|$|E
5|$|The {{length of}} time that a typical {{prisoner}} was kept at the Bastille continued to decline, and by Louis XVI's reign {{the average length of}} detention was only two months. Prisoners <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> expected to sign a document on their release, promising not to talk about the Bastille or their time within it, but by the 1780s this agreement was frequently broken. Prisoners leaving the Bastille could be granted pensions on their release by the Crown, either as a form of compensation or as a way of ensuring future good behaviour – Voltaire was granted 1,200 livres a year, for example, while Latude received an annual pension of 400 livres.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, some {{questions}} surrounded whether the recently injured Yao Ming <b>would</b> <b>still</b> captain the squad. In mid-July, {{it was confirmed that}} he <b>would</b> <b>still</b> continue to <b>be</b> the captain.|$|R
50|$|The Molinist {{claims that}} in this example, God knows what His free creatures would choose under {{hypothetical}} circumstances, namely that the Sodomites would have responded {{in such a way}} that Sodom <b>would</b> <b>still</b> have <b>been</b> in existence in Jesus' day.|$|R
50|$|Small wheels {{used for}} steering, either one {{to each side}} or a single unit either in front of or behind the vehicle. It {{is a matter of}} debate as to whether such a vehicle <b>would</b> <b>still</b> {{properly}} <b>be</b> called a monowheel.|$|R
5|$|The revised meeting date of 16 August, however, {{coincided with}} {{his visit to}} the horse races at York, a fashionable event at which Byng had entries in two races. He once again wrote to the Home Office, saying that {{although}} he <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> prepared to be in command in Manchester {{on the day of the}} meeting if it was thought really necessary, he had absolute confidence in his deputy commander, Lieutenant Colonel Guy L'Estrange.|$|E
5|$|While MLS {{has looked}} into {{changing}} to a fall-to-spring format, {{there are no}} current plans to do so. If the league were to change its schedule, a substantial winter break <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> necessary due to teams being located in harsh winter climates. It {{would also have to}} compete with the popularity and media presence of the National Football League (NFL) in the fall and winter as well as the National Basketball Association (NBA) and National Hockey League (NHL), which both run on fall-to-spring schedules.|$|E
5|$|Zardari {{prevented}} Bhutto's autopsy {{in accordance}} with Islamic principles. He and their children attended her funeral, which was held the next day. He denied government allegations that the assassination was sponsored by Al-Qaida. He called for an international inquiry into her death and stated that she <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> alive if Musharraf's government had provided adequate protection. He and his family offered to accept Musharraf's demand to exhume Bhutto's body {{in exchange for a}} United Nations inquiry, but Musharraf rejected the proposal.|$|E
