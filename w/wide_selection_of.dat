5|$|From 1988 onwards {{analyses}} {{based on}} molecular phylogeny, which compares biochemical {{features such as}} similarities in DNA, have placed brachiopods among the Lophotrochozoa, a protostome super-phylum that includes molluscs, annelids and flatworms but excludes the other protostome super-phylum Ecdysozoa, whose members include arthropods. This conclusion is unanimous among molecular phylogeny studies, which use a <b>wide</b> <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> genes: rDNA, Hox genes, mitochondrial protein genes, single nuclear protein genes and sets of nuclear protein genes.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a strong}} {{tradition}} of home baking in Israel arising from the years when {{there were very few}} bakeries to meet demand.

5|$|As the {{traditional}} method of making borscht with beet sour often requires planning {{at least several}} days ahead, many recipes for quicker borscht replace the beet sour with fresh beetroot juice, while the sour taste is imparted by other ingredients, such as vinegar, lemon juice or citric acid, tomatoes, tart apples, dry red wine, dill pickle juice, sauerkraut juice, or a fermented rye flour and water mixture. The soup is typically flavored with a <b>wide</b> <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> herbs, spices and condiments. Salt, black pepper, garlic, bay leaves and dill {{are among the most}} commonly used. Other aromatics often added to borscht include allspice, celery stalks, parsley, marjoram, hot peppers, saffron, horseradish, ginger and prunes. Some recipes require flour or roux to further thicken the borscht. A common opinion is that a good borscht should be thick enough for a spoon to stand upright in it.|$|E

5|$|The cabin {{located on}} the main deck {{underneath}} the sterncastle {{is thought to have}} belonged to the barber-surgeon. He was a trained professional who saw to the health and welfare of the crew and acted as the medical expert on board.

More objects were found around the cabin, such as earscoops, shaving bowls and combs. With this <b>wide</b> <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> tools and medicaments the barber-surgeon, along with one or more assistants, could set bone fractures, perform amputations and deal with other acute injuries, treat a number of diseases and provide crew members with a minimal standard of personal hygiene.|$|E
