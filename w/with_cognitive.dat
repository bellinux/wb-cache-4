30|$|Because {{internal}} cognitive styles {{prefer to}} work alone {{rather than in}} a group, it would follow that employees <b>with</b> internal <b>cognitive</b> styles would be well-suited to remote work and this match between their cognitive style and the situation would probably be associated with high levels of commitment [26].

40|$|Patients <b>with</b> mild <b>cognitive</b> {{impairment}} are at {{an increased}} risk of progression to Alzheimer's disease. However, not all patients <b>with</b> mild <b>cognitive</b> impairment progress, {{and it is difficult to}} accurately identify those patients who are in the prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease. In a recent paper, Koivunen and colleagues report that Pittsburgh compound-B, an amyloid-beta positron emission tomography ligand, predicts the progression of patients <b>with</b> mild <b>cognitive</b> impairment to Alzheimer's disease. Of 29 subjects <b>with</b> mild <b>cognitive</b> impairment, 21 (72 %) had a positive Pittsburgh compound-B positron emission tomography baseline scan. In their study, 15 of these 21 (71 %) patients progressed to Alzheimer's disease, whilst only 1 out of 8 (12. 5 %) Pittsburgh compound-B-negative patients <b>with</b> mild <b>cognitive</b> impairment did so. Moreover, in these mild cognitive impairment patients, the overall amyloid burden increased approximately 2. 5 % during the follow-up period. This is consistent with other longitudinal amyloid imaging studies that found a similar increase in amyloid deposition over time in patients <b>with</b> mild <b>cognitive</b> impairment. These studies together challenge current theories that propose a flattening of the increase of brain amyloid deposition already in the preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease. These findings may have important implications for the design of future clinical trials aimed at preventing progression to Alzheimer's disease by lowering the brain amyloid-beta burden in patients <b>with</b> mild <b>cognitive</b> impairment.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{test whether}} susceptibility-weighted {{magnetic}} resonance imaging at baseline may help predict cognitive decline. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study {{was approved by the}} institutional review board, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Thirty-five healthy control subjects and 69 patients <b>with</b> mild <b>cognitive</b> impairment were included. Patients <b>with</b> mild <b>cognitive</b> impairment underwent neuropsychologic follow-up after 1 year (40 patients <b>with</b> stable mild <b>cognitive</b> impairment, 27 <b>with</b> progressive mild <b>cognitive</b> impairment, and two lost to follow-up). Cerebral microhemorrhages were visually analyzed by two experienced neuroradiologists in consensus. Iron deposition in deep gray matter was assessed with voxel-wise and region-of-interest analysis after nonlinear spatial registration. In addition, individual classification of mild cognitive impairment was analyzed by using a support vector machine (SVM). RESULTS: At baseline, the number of cerebral microhemorrhages was significantly higher in the mild cognitive impairment group than in the control group (P <. 01) but did not differ between the patients with stable and those <b>with</b> progressive mild <b>cognitive</b> impairment. Compared <b>with</b> the control group, patients <b>with</b> mild <b>cognitive</b> impairment had increased iron concentration in the right pallidum (P <. 01) and right substantia nigra (P <. 01) but decreased concentration in the right red nucleus (P <. 05). The classification based on the SVM successfully helped discriminate patients <b>with</b> mild <b>cognitive</b> impairment from the healthy control subjects (accuracy, 84 %; sensitivity, 89 %; specificity, 85 %) and those with stable from those <b>with</b> progressive mild <b>cognitive</b> impairment (accuracy, 85 %; sensitivity, 84 %; specificity, 83 %). CONCLUSION: The findings reveal an accumulation of cerebral microhemorrhage in patients <b>with</b> mild <b>cognitive</b> impairment that is present at baseline, independent of subsequent cognitive decline, as well as an altered iron distribution in subcortical nuclei between the healthy control subjects and patients <b>with</b> mild <b>cognitive</b> impairment. Analysis of iron deposition at baseline performed with an SVM might help identify individual patients <b>with</b> mild <b>cognitive</b> impairment at risk for cognitive decline.

40|$|What is {{the role}} of {{cognitive}} skills in decision making under uncertainty? We address this question by examining the relationship between responses to survey questions about subjective probabilities of stock market returns and stock holding decisions. Based on data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), we find that for individuals <b>with</b> lower <b>cognitive</b> skills the association between measured probabilities and decisions is weaker than for individuals <b>with</b> higher <b>cognitive</b> skills. Additional evidence suggests that individuals <b>with</b> lower <b>cognitive</b> skills are more likely to give heuristic answers to questions about stock return probabilities. A likely explanation is that individuals <b>with</b> lower <b>cognitive</b> skills have a fuzzier mental representation of stock returns that cannot be captured by a unique well-defined probability distribution. In contrast, individuals <b>with</b> higher <b>cognitive</b> skills are more likely to act as if subjective probabilities are meaningful measures of uncertainty.

In our model, individuals <b>with</b> low <b>cognitive</b> skills make decisions in an intuitive non-probabilistic way based on cues and feelings. Individuals <b>with</b> high <b>cognitive</b> skills make decisions akin to the expected utility model. As predicted by our model, in our empirical analysis we find that there is a significantly stronger association between subjective return probabilities and stockholding decisions for individuals <b>with</b> high <b>cognitive</b> skills, compared to individuals <b>with</b> lower <b>cognitive</b> skills.

Previous research shows that coping strategies and Theory of Mind (ToM) can help sustaining cognitive performance after a traumatic experience. Objective We conducted a study to examine whether coping strategies used by elementary school children who were victims of the earthquakes were helpful in facing the consequences of these earthquakes by being positively associated with ToM and, in turn, <b>with</b> better <b>cognitive</b> performance. Methods We administered a questionnaire to 517 elementary school children {{a few months after the}} earthquakes of May 2012. Results Results revealed that active coping strategies were associated with greater ToM abilities that, in turn, were related <b>with</b> better <b>cognitive</b> performance. In contrast, negative coping strategies were negatively associated with the ability to mentalize othersâ mental states and, in turn, <b>with</b> less positive <b>cognitive</b> performance. Avoidant coping strategies were positively associated <b>with</b> improved <b>cognitive</b> performance. Moreover, they were also associated <b>with</b> better <b>cognitive</b> performance via greater ToM abilities (this latter effect was present only among those perceiving stronger social support from their peers). Conclusions Active and avoidant coping strategies and ToM are important factors associated <b>with</b> better <b>cognitive</b> performance in the aftermath of a natural disaster...|$|R

Determining structural imaging biomarkers associated with prodromal Parkinsonâs disease dementia may allow for the earlier identification of those at risk, and allow for targeted disease modifying therapies. One hundred and five non-demented subjects with newly diagnosed idiopathic Parkinsonâs disease and 37 healthy matched controls had serial 3 T structural magnetic resonance imaging scans with clinical and neuropsychological assessments at baseline, which were repeated after 18 months. The Movement Disorder Society Task Force criteria were used to classify the Parkinsonâs disease subjects into Parkinsonâs disease <b>with</b> mild <b>cognitive</b> impairment (n = 39) and Parkinsonâs disease <b>with</b> no <b>cognitive</b> impairment (n = 66). Freesurfer image processing software {{was used to measure}} cortical thickness and subcortical volumes at baseline and follow-up. We compared regional percentage change of cortical thinning and subcortical atrophy over 18 months. At baseline, cases with Parkinsonâs disease <b>with</b> mild <b>cognitive</b> impairment demonstrated widespread cortical thinning relative to controls and atrophy of the nucleus accumbens compared to both controls and subjects with Parkinsonâs disease <b>with</b> no <b>cognitive</b> impairment. Regional cortical thickness at baseline was correlated with global cognition in the combined Parkinsonâs disease cohort. Over 18 months, patients with Parkinsonâs disease <b>with</b> mild <b>cognitive</b> impairment demonstrated more severe cortical thinning in frontal and temporo-parietal cortices, including hippocampal atrophy, relative to those with Parkinsonâs disease and no {{cognitive impairment}} and healthy controls, whereas subjects with Parkinsonâs disease and no cognitive impairment showed more severe frontal cortical thinning compared to healthy controls. At baseline, Parkinsonâs disease <b>with</b> no <b>cognitive</b> impairment converters showed bilateral temporal cortex thinning relative to the Parkinsonâs disease <b>with</b> no <b>cognitive</b> impairment stable subjects. Although loss of both cortical and subcortical volume occurs in non-demented Parkinsonâs disease, our longitudinal analyses revealed that Parkinsonâs disease <b>with</b> mild <b>cognitive</b> impairment shows more extensive atrophy and greater percentage of cortical thinning compared to Parkinsonâs disease <b>with</b> no <b>cognitive</b> impairment.
