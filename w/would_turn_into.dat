5|$|Writer Troy Kennedy Martin {{was greatly}} {{influenced}} by the political climate of the time, dominated by the Thatcher government, and the aura of secrecy surrounding the nuclear industry – and by {{the implications of the}} Gaia hypothesis of environmentalist James Lovelock; these combined to his crafting a thriller that mingled real world concerns with mythic and mystical elements. Kennedy Martin's original ending was more fantastic than that eventually used in the finished serial: he had proposed that Craven <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> a tree but this was vetoed by members of the cast and crew.|$|E
5|$|York City F.C. ceased {{ownership}} of their Bootham Crescent {{ground in the}} summer of 1999, after the club's real property assets were transferred to a holding company called Bootham Crescent Holdings. The club secured a £2million loan from the Football Stadia Improvement Fund (FSIF) to buy the ground in February 2004. The terms of this loan required the club to identify a site for a new stadium by 2007, and have detailed planning permission by 2009, to avoid financial penalties. Once plans for a new stadium were in place, the loan <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> a grant to assist in funding the relocation.|$|E
5|$|MacFarlane {{notes that}} he was {{surprised}} {{they were allowed to}} do the pickle gag, which consisted of Stewie placing a cucumber on the sofa where Patrick's imaginary wife is sitting, but inserting it into her imaginary vagina (to see if it <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> a pickle), but suggests that maybe broadcasting standards did not fully understand the scene. The music song by the overweight people at a funeral for a murdered obese man was only shown on the DVD version and not televised, for timing purposes, and for potential boredom to viewers. The musical composition was recorded at Fox studios on the Gary Numan stage. George W. Bush is portrayed hiding in a tree house and being informed by Brian of Hurricane Katrina. Bush was offered the opportunity to voice himself, but declined.|$|E

50|$|As old highway maps show, State Route 35 was {{originally}} designated State Route 5. The number was {{changed in the}} 1964 renumbering. The original state route 35 was located in southern California and ran north to south from State Route 22 to U.S. 99, first along Los Alamitos Blvd. going north which <b>turns</b> <b>into</b> Norwalk Blvd. The highway continued west on Centralia Road and then north along Pioneer Blvd. until hitting San Antonio drive at Rosecrans Ave. San Antonio Dr. <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> back <b>into</b> Norwalk blvd. and Route 35 <b>would</b> continue <b>turning</b> <b>into</b> Old Mill Road at Beverly Blvd. Route 35 would wind through Rose Hills and Avocado Heights as Workman Mill Rd. and <b>would</b> then <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> Puente Ave. at Valley Blvd. and continue to Route 99 where Route 35 ended at the border of Baldwin Park and West Covina.|$|R
5|$|By 1983, Jonathan Powell was keen to put {{the serial}} into {{production}} and offered the scripts to producer Michael Wearing who was immediately impressed by the scenes in the first episode, “Compassionate Leave”, depicting Craven's reaction to Emma's death, describing them as “the most sustained evocation of individual grief in bereavement that I can remember”. The budget was set at £2 million, of which £400,000 came from an American co-producer, Lionheart Television International. Director Martin Campbell came on board shortly afterwards and soon clashed with Troy Kennedy Martin, demanding rewrites, in particular {{to the notion that}} Craven had known about Emma's involvement with GAIA right from the start; this was removed at Campbell's behest. Further clashes over the script occurred between Kennedy Martin and star Bob Peck over the conclusion in which his character <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> a tree; Peck recalled that “it didn't seem to be working in script terms, it seemed as though we wouldn't {{be able to make it}} work for the audience”, a view echoed by Michael Wearing who felt that it was “likely not to come off as an effect”. Kennedy Martin capitulated, introducing instead the concept of the black flowers seen in the finished production. However, some elements of Kennedy Martin's original vision persist in the final script: for example, in episode three, “Burden of Proof”, the ghost of Emma urges Craven, as he undergoes a breakdown, to be strong, like a tree.|$|E
5|$|The {{two cities}} were later pushed toward merger by a {{disaster}} that nearly {{wiped out the}} falls. The geological formation of the area consisted of a hard, thin layer of limestone overlaying a soft sandstone formation. As the sandstone eroded away, large blocks of limestone would fall off. The expansion of milling and industry at the falls accelerated the process of erosion. If the fragile limestone cap ever eroded away completely, the falls <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> a rapids that would no longer provide water power. This process {{came to a head}} on October 4, 1869, when a tunnel under Hennepin Island and Nicollet Island collapsed and filled with water. With the limestone cap breached, the tunnel quickly created a torrent of water that blasted Hennepin Island and threatened to destroy the falls. The falls were shored up quickly, and over the next several years, the falls were repaired by building a wooden apron, sealing the tunnel, and building low dams above the falls to avoid exposing the limestone to the weather. This work was assisted by the federal government, and was eventually completed in 1884. The federal government spent $615,000 on this effort, while the two cities spent $334,500. Possibly {{as a result of the}} bonding needed to rehabilitate the falls, the cities of St. Anthony and Minneapolis merged on April 9, 1872.|$|E
5|$|In {{the field}} of entertainment, Mutual built on the {{incomparable}} success of The Shadow. WGN's Chicago Theater of the Air, featuring hour-long opera and musical theater productions before a live audience, was broadcast {{for the first time}} in May 1940. By 1943, the weekly show was being recorded in front of houses 4,000 strong, gathered to see performances featuring a full orchestra and chorus. Chicago Theater of the Air would run on Mutual through March 1955. Mutual provided an early national outlet for the influential, iconoclastic satirist Henry Morgan, whose show Here's Morgan began its network run in October 1940. Though The Lone Ranger moved over to NBC Blue in May 1942, within a few months Mutual had another reliable, and no less famous, action hero. The Adventures of Superman, picked up from WOR, would run on the network from August 1942 to June 1949. In April 1943, Mutual launched what <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> one of its longest-lasting shows: debuting as The Return of Nick Carter and later retitled Nick Carter, Master Detective, it would be a network staple through September 1955. From May 1943 through May 1946, Mutual aired The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, reprising their roles from the Universal film series. An earlier incarnation of the show had run briefly on the network in 1936; a less starry version would return to Mutual from September 1947 through June 1949. The Mysterious Traveler, a proto–Twilight Zone anthology series, aired every week on Mutual from December 1943 until September 1952.|$|E

25|$|For the {{manufacture}} of biodiesel, sodium hydroxide {{is used as a}} catalyst for the transesterification of methanol and triglycerides. This only works with anhydrous sodium hydroxide, because combined with water the fat <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> soap, which would be tainted with methanol. NaOH is used more often than potassium hydroxide because it is cheaper and a smaller quantity is needed.|$|E
25|$|As for a {{sequence}} nominative-genitive, {{it may be}} the norm in Latin in a similar ratio. E.g. “Systema Naturae”. Indeed, the sequence nominative-genitive must always be the norm in Peano’s Interlingua, since the preposition de must introduce the genitive. Thus, Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> Principio Mathematico de Philosophia Naturale. Since the function of both the adjective and the genitive is often the same, one might infer that the sequence noun-adjective might always be the norm.|$|E

He was clocked at 75mph at the age of 14, although the only issue was that the majority of his bowling was waist-high. He then moved onto unorthodox off-breaks, which were deemed illegal right from the start, and so he started to keep wicket for his school.|$|E
25|$|Gardens and {{gardening}} have {{a special}} place in Singaporean culture as well as in politics. Historically this is all officially attributed to Lee Kuan Yew who apparently spearheaded this philosophy in 1963. In a rare interview with Monty Don shown in the TV-series Around the World in 80 Gardens, Lee Kuan Yew reveals that after visits to other big Asian cities such as Hong Kong and Bangkok he feared that Singapore <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> another concrete jungle, and he decided that gardens and parks should be established everywhere and made this a priority of the government.|$|E
25|$|With his ranks swelled by Italian {{troops and}} Spanish colonial {{soldiers}} from Morocco, Franco made {{another attempt to}} capture Madrid in January and February 1937, but was again unsuccessful. The Battle of Málaga started in mid-January, and this Nationalist offensive in Spain's southeast <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> {{a disaster for the}} Republicans, who were poorly organised and armed. The city was taken by Franco on 8 February. The consolidation of various militias into the Republican Army had started in December 1936. The main Nationalist advance to cross the Jarama and cut the supply to Madrid by the Valencia road, termed the Battle of Jarama, led to heavy casualties (6,000–20,000) on both sides. The operation's main objective was not met, though Nationalists gained a modest amount of territory.|$|E

25|$|Like many Carlists Caylà {{welcomed the}} fall of Alfonsist monarchy, unlike most of them he did not {{demonstrate}} hostility to the Republic and – clearly against most Carlists – he hoped that it would produce a genuine democracy. In his Joventut editorials Caylà remained cautious and preferred not to jump to conclusions as to the new regime. As a monarchist loyal to the carlist claimant he acknowledged with little enthusiasm {{that the majority of}} Spaniards opted for republican solution, though he seemed to respect the choice. He called his fellow Carlists not to renounce their vision, suggesting to see whether the Republic <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> an orderly state or whether the project would fail. In his trademark style he warned that extremism was the key enemy of the new regime.|$|E
25|$|Recombination {{frequency}} is {{a measure}} of genetic linkage and is used {{in the creation of a}} genetic linkage map. Recombination frequency (θ) is the frequency with which a single chromosomal crossover will take place between two genes during meiosis. A centimorgan (cM) is a unit that describes a recombination frequency of 1%. In this way we can measure the genetic distance between two loci, based upon their recombination frequency. This is a good estimate of the real distance. Double crossovers <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> no recombination. In this case we cannot tell if crossovers took place. If the loci we're analysing are very close (less than 7 cM) a double crossover is very unlikely. When distances become higher, the likelihood of a double crossover increases. As the likelihood of a double crossover increases we systematically underestimate the genetic distance between two loci.|$|E
25|$|In late April, a {{large group}} of {{chanting}} militants surrounded the French commissariat at Savannakhet. Believing that the French ammunition <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> frangipani flowers, 150 rebels were slain and an equal number were wounded. The insurgents then relocated to the Phou Luong mountains, ceasing their activities until 1905. On 30 November 1905, insurgents massacred 41 Loven tribesmen in Ban Nong Bok Kao. Renewed French operations forced Ong Keo to surrender; however, he soon fled to Siam only to return to Laos and resume his struggle in the Bolovens Plateau. In 1910, Ong Keo was assassinated by French representative Fendler during peace negotiations, Fendler had hidden a pistol under his hat which remained undetected as the head was not searched according to Lao customs. Ong Keo's officer Ong Kommandam then assumed command of the rebels before being shot in January 1936. Khomadam's death {{put an end to the}} rebellion.|$|E

25|$|There {{had been}} a {{revolution}} in fire power since 1871, {{with the introduction of}} breech-loading weapons, quick-firing artillery and the evasion of the effects of increased fire power, by the use of barbed wire and field fortifications, the prospect of a swift advance by frontal assault was remote, making battles indecisive. Major-General Ernst Köpke, the Generalquartiermeister of the German army in 1895, wrote that an invasion of France past Nancy <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> siege warfare and the certainty of no quick and decisive victory. Emphasis on operational envelopment came from the knowledge of a likely tactical stalemate. The problem for the German army was that a long war implied defeat, because the probable coalition of enemies, France, Russia and Britain, was far more powerful. The role claimed by the German army as the anti-socialist foundation, on which the social order was based, also made the army apprehensive about the internal strains that would be generated by a long war.|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} nekomata, another cat-like yōkai which {{is said to}} derive from a cat whose tail split into two when it grew older, there are folk beliefs across Japan about how aged cats <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> bakeneko. There are tales of cats raised for twelve years in Ibaraki Prefecture and Nagano Prefecture, and for {{thirteen}} years in Kunigami District, Okinawa Prefecture, that became bakeneko. In Yamagata District, Hiroshima Prefecture, {{it is said that}} a cat raised for seven years or longer would kill the one that raised it. There are also many regions where when people began raising a cat, they would decide in advance for how many years they would raise it because of this superstition. Also, depending on the area, there are stories in which cats that were killed by humans in a brutal manner would become bakeneko and curse that human. The stories of bakeneko are not only about aged cats, but are also sometimes stories of revenge against cruel humans.|$|E
25|$|The Cerro de la Bufa is {{very close}} to the city of Guanajuato and has a number of stories {{associated}} with it. At sunset, there is a formation that looks like the profile of the face of a bearded man. According to tradition, this is the face of Christ. There are two caves consecrated to Ignatius of Loyola. There are {{on opposite sides of the}} summit and called the “old” and “new” cave. Each 31 of July, there is a pilgrimage to the “new” cave in honor of the saint. Sometime during the colonial period, an image of Ignatius was painted on a wall. According to legend, a group of male witches used to use the cave for their rites on the eve before the Catholic ritual, “forcing” the image on the wall to observe. The Cerro de la Bufa is home to another legend about an enchanted princess. It states that on feast days, a woman would appear to a man on a road in the mountain and ask him to carry her to the Basilica in the city center in his arms. If he did so, the city of Guanajuato would return to the height of its wealth. If he chose to do so, noises and threats from behind would haunt him. If he lost his resolve, the woman <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> a serpent and kill him. No woman has ever been carried from this mountain to the Basilica.|$|E
