25|$|United Kingdom {{labour law}} regulates the {{relations}} between workers, employers and trade unions. People {{at work in the}} UK benefit from a minimum charter of employment rights, which are found in various Acts, Regulations, common law and equity. This includes the right to a minimum wage of £7.50 for over 25-year-olds under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998. The Working Time Regulations 1998 give the right to 28 days paid holidays, breaks from work, and attempts to limit excessively long working hours. The Employment Rights Act 1996 gives the right to leave for child care, and the right to request flexible <b>working</b> <b>patterns.</b> The Pensions Act 2008 gives the right to be automatically enrolled in a basic occupational pension, whose funds must be protected according to the Pensions Act 1995.|$|E
25|$|Stalin {{worked into}} the evenings, eating lunch at 4 or 5pm and dinner no earlier than 9pm; other senior {{political}} figures had to accommodate his unusual <b>working</b> <b>patterns.</b> He {{spent much time}} in the Kremlin cinema, where he enjoyed watching films with other high-ranking officials late at night; he had a particular fondness for the Western genre. Stalin enjoyed alcoholic beverages, and at dinner parties and other social events would encourage those around him to join in, hoping that in a drunken state they would reveal secrets. He enjoyed practical jokes, for instance by putting a tomato on the seat of Politburo members and waiting for them to sit on it, and encouraged singing at social events. As an infant, Stalin had displayed a love of flowers, and later in life he became a keen gardener. His dacha in the Moscow suburb of Volynskoe was surrounded by a 50-acre park, with Stalin devoting much attention to its agricultural activities. Stalin was also an accomplished billiards player.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{watercourse}} section surveying {{has become}} more and more important in engineering reconnaissance nowadays, and based on ever urgent social demand for watercourse section surveying, the paper analyzed the subject of how to improve the watercourse section surveying and plotting efficiency. Through studying the opposite side surveying procedure inside the total station and the section surveying and graph plotting method in CASS, an integration of field and office <b>working</b> <b>pattern</b> for section surveying was summarized. The result shows that the <b>working</b> <b>pattern</b> can greatly improve the heretofore less uncultured section surveying and plotting method. Finally it's concluded that the integration of field and office <b>working</b> <b>pattern</b> for section surveying can effectively increase the section surveying and plotting efficiency...|$|R

2500|$|In further {{specific}} situations, {{there are}} a jumble of other rights to leave spread across the ERA 1996 sections 55 to 80I. [...] "Emergency leave" [...] is, under ERA 1996 section 57A, available for employees to deal with birth or a child's issues at school, {{as well as other}} emergencies such as dependents' illness or death, so long as the employee informs the employer as soon as reasonably practicable. In Qua v John Ford Morrison Solicitors Cox J emphasised that there is no requirement to deliver daily updates. After EA 2002, employees gained the right to request flexible <b>working</b> <b>patterns</b> for the purpose of caring for a child under the age of 6, or a disabled child under age 18. The right to make the request is contained in ERA 1996 section 80F, {{and despite the fact that}} employers may decline the request, employers grant requests in 80 per cent of cases. An employee must make the request in writing, the employer must reply in writing, and can only decline the request on the basis of a correct fact assessment, and within 8 grounds listed in section 80G, which generally concern business and organisational necessity. In Commotion Ltd v Rutty a toy warehouse assistant was refused a reduction to part-time work because, according to the manager, everyone needed to work full-time to maintain [...] "team spirit". The Employment Appeal Tribunal ruled that because [...] "team spirit" [...] was not one of the legitimate grounds for refusal, Mrs Rutty should get compensation, which is set at a maximum of 8 weeks' pay. Finally, the ERA 1996 sections 63D-I give employees (and agency workers are expressly included) the right to request the right to get time off for training.|$|E

40|$|The {{patterns}} of paid and unpaid work adopted by migrants {{families with dependent}} children are more or less similar to that of prevailing <b>working</b> <b>pattern</b> of men and women of Australian born couples. A case study with 28 couple families, 14 husbands and 14 wives who migrated from Nepal under "skill" or "professional" category and the literature review on paid and unpaid work of couple {{families with dependent children}} show that in both families the trend of change of <b>working</b> <b>pattern</b> in paid and unpaid work is similar. With the increased participation of married women in the paid labour force, men increased participation in household work. There is increased household work for both husbands and wives, but women tend to do more household "inside" and childcare work than men. In the mean time, men tend to do more work in the "masculine" sphere of "outside" work in house maintenance, repair and car care. The only factor that differentiates <b>working</b> <b>pattern</b> of migrant families with Australian born families is the experience of migration and the category that they migrated. The change of working practice of paid and unpaid work of migrant families are affected by the change of family type from extended family to two generational family and their education and previous work experience that they brought along with them. Professional migrants who migrated family as a "unit" migrated spouse and dependent children together and they made their own decision to migrate, unlike other categories of migrants who migrated from political or economic pressure. One of the important experiences of migrant families is that there are new opportunity, new lifestyle, new intimacy and companionship and new sharing of work between husbands and wives after migration. At the same time, there are losses of extended family relatives, close friends and cultural event which affects their day to day lives. There are Australian based friends who provided support in the initial period of migration but these families do not provide regular assistance or support which family relatives provided in Nepal...|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] Working {{time is a}} {{recurrent}} topic of study because the nature of work, its content, {{the conditions under which}} it is performed and the labour market itself keep changing. These changes have an impact on working time duration and the way working time is organised. One of the manifest results is the erosion of a clear demarcation between working time and non-working time – the work and private sphere. The European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS) is among the sources that have clearly established the link between <b>working</b> time <b>patterns</b> and the health and wellbeing of workers. Eurofound’s research on job quality shows that working time quality is one of the crucial contributing elements. ]This report examines <b>working</b> time <b>patterns</b> in more detail. It provides an overview of the recent evolution of working time duration and organisation in the EU and highlights the most important trends and differences between Member States. Through an in-depth analysis of data from the sixth EWCS (2015), it also examines, from a gender and life course perspective, the links between <b>working</b> time <b>patterns,</b> work–life balance and working time preferences {{on the one hand and}} workers’ health and well-being, on the other. Finally, it explores the implications of <b>working</b> time <b>patterns</b> for the longterm sustainability of work...|$|R
