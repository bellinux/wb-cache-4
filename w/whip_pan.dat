500|$|Robert Legato and Rick Berman spent {{forty minutes}} on the {{telephone}} with Shearer during the strike. While she refused to write the lines during the strike, Berman suggested dialogue and Shearer would give opinions with Legato taking down handwritten notes. Legato decided on the directing notes himself, and used a <b>whip</b> <b>pan</b> shot instead of an effects shot to film the three Datas as director Robert Becker had never used effects shots previously. Shearer wasn't happy with the final result, saying [...] "we were writing the most romantic episode in the world" [...] but that [...] "it was toned down 75%".|$|E

5000|$|... {{incorporating}} various {{camera angles}} {{such as the}} Dutch angle (see Mission Impossible), <b>Whip</b> <b>pan</b> (see the opening of Hot Fuzz) and Whip zoom (see the Kiddo/Driver fight in Kill Bill Vol. 2); ...|$|E
5000|$|His Bonds {{range from}} the {{original}} Sean Connery, his personal favorite, to George Lazenby, to Roger Moore, to Timothy Dalton (whom Maibaum considered the best actor of the four) [...] and the directors include Terence Young, Guy Hamilton, Lewis Gilbert, Peter R. Hunt (who had been the editor on the first five Bonds and is credited with creating its visual style of quick cuts, <b>whip</b> <b>pans</b> & action) and John Glen.|$|R

2500|$|Saw III {{was given}} a larger budget of $10 million, {{compared}} to Saw IIs $4 million. Principal photography took place for 27 days at Toronto's Cinespace Film Studios from [...] to late June. [...] Production borrowed the bathroom set used in Scary Movie 4, which parodied Saw and Saw II, since it closely resembled the old set. [...] Almost all the transitions {{from one place to}} another were not made using digital effects; the transitions were shot on the spot. For example, when the camera moves from Troy's crime scene to Kerry being in the bathtub, Meyer had to run, take off all her clothes, and jump into the tub. Visually the film is akin to the previous two with using quick cuts and fast-paced rhythms. Bousman said, [...] "We're using a lot of <b>whip</b> <b>pans</b> and [...] to create a dynamic feel". [...] Post-production services were provided by Deluxe.|$|R
50|$|A <b>whip</b> <b>pan</b> {{is a type}} of {{pan shot}} in which the camera pans so quickly that the picture blurs into indistinct streaks. It is {{commonly}} used as a transition between shots, and can indicate the passage of time or a frenetic pace of action.|$|E
50|$|Like {{the match}} cut, the {{invisible}} cut attempts to join two shots with similar frames together. The invisible cut, however, {{is designed to}} completely hide {{the transition from the}} audience. The audience can deduce a cut has occurred, but they {{would have a hard time}} pinpointing the exact moment. Eg, should a character walk towards the camera, completely covering it, the cut is introduced when the back of the character is shown walking away. The invisible cut can also be hidden by a <b>whip</b> <b>pan,</b> entering/leaving a very dark or very light environment, or by an object crossing the screen.|$|E

500|$|Filmed in real time, {{the episode}} is {{designed}} to look like it was recorded in four uninterrupted eleven-minute takes. Carter explained, [...] "I said [...] 'Wouldn't it be great since we have 44 minutes of programming time if we just did an episode where we did four 11-minute takes and put it all together?' And everyone {{looked at me like}} I was nuts." [...] To film the episode, camera operator Dave Luckenbach wore a steadicam. However, the steadicam used could only hold a maximum of four minutes of film, so discreet edits and cuts were necessary. Luckenbach later likened the physical aftermath of filming to playing football, [...] "You'd have a game on Friday, and you'd wake up Saturday and really feel it." [...] The cuts were usually made during <b>whip</b> <b>pans</b> or in scenes when the screen would go dark. With the exception of Mulder jumping off the Queen Anne, the only noticeable editing occurs between scenes, when a side swipe shifts between the two different time periods. Many of the takes needed to be nearly perfect; for example, of the takes made on the eighth day of filming, only two of ten were deemed satisfactory.|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} I {{have been working}} on a series of ‘empty’ films – {{reducing}} content so that focus might be thrown on forms, styles and qualities that are hard to perceive in content-driven work. In making House, I tried to achieve this by both following and subverting the logic of television. Much of the content of television is banal, but is presented in ways that aim to create a sense energy and excitement for the viewer. House follows this logic, reducing content to a series of banal shots of the interior of a house, presented in a rapid montage of <b>whip</b> <b>pans.</b> These two particular stylistic devices were the staple of title sequences for many years – sequences that were usually more interesting than the programmes they introduced. In House my aim was to draw on these outdated elements of televisual language create an audiovisual experience that is drained of ‘content’, with the result that that attention is directed towards the specific qualities of the video image. The footage was shot on two Sony AVC series black and white cameras from the 1970 s, whose video tubes create particular visual effects – such as ghosting and tracing - that not only serve to foreground the image, but also increase the opacity time and space...|$|R

50|$|A few {{interesting}} {{shots from}} the 1995-1998 Nitro telecast include: a stationary camera (with surrounding crowd) high in the rafters giving a wide panning view of the arena - a JIB camera framed on props and pieces of equipment on the set that would boom or <b>whip</b> <b>pan</b> onto the entranceway - and various Steadicam shots following wrestlers to the ring. With the JIB and Steadicam both having wide-angle lenses and in close proximity on the set, there was {{a high risk of}} one camera capturing another. Depending on the position of the JIB, Leathers would sometimes have the Steadicam frame a shot on the ground. When cross dissolved to the Steadicam, the operator would tilt up and quickly move towards the subject. This would prove to be a stylish wipe sequence between both cameras, and in effect gave the JIB more time to swing out of view.|$|E
50|$|Whedon came up {{with the}} idea of {{building}} each deck of Serenity as a contiguous set, so that he could establish the size of the spaceship, and film scenes where the actors could be followed as they moved around the ship. The two sets were built on separate sound stages, making second unit filming possible. The opening to the film highlights this: a 4 minute shot (technically two shots connected together) near the start of the movie follows Mal from the bridge as he walks along the entire upper deck set, down a set of stairs near the engine room (where the cut is hidden by a <b>whip</b> <b>pan</b> from Mal to Simon) and back along the lower deck set to the cargo bay. This shot (and similar shots in the early episodes) were intended to establish the space which made up the ship, and where locations were in relation to each other.|$|E
5000|$|The full, uncut {{animation}} {{shown at}} the concert begins with a cartoon image of a hill. On {{top of the hill}} are indistinct objects, moving. Suddenly, as the guitar leitmotif plays briefly, the sky goes dark grey, a symbol of evil. The scene scrolls down to reveal London being enveloped in darkness as [...] "Would you like to see..." [...] {{and the rest of the}} verse is sung. Then, an abandoned tricycle is shown, as [...] "Would you like to send..." [...] and the rest of that verse is sung. An abandoned playground is shown as the final verse is sung. Then a viaduct appears, where something is goose-stepping. At long last it is revealed to us that the objects on the hill, what possibly scared the children and what was under the viaduct, are marching hammers. As the fascist dictator shows increasing desperation, louder and angrier, there is a <b>whip</b> <b>pan</b> in to the hammers, and as the camera pans there is a sudden, loud, abrupt instrumental sound, which is quickly replaced by a piano. The animation stops, as the audience is taken into [...] "Stop".|$|E
500|$|Citizen Kane was {{edited by}} Robert Wise and {{assistant}} editor Mark Robson. Both would become successful film directors. Wise was hired after Welles finished shooting the [...] "camera tests" [...] and began officially making the film. Wise said that Welles [...] "had an older editor assigned {{to him for}} those tests and evidently he was not too happy and asked to have somebody else. I was roughly Orson's age and had several good credits." [...] Wise and Robson began editing the film {{while it was still}} shooting and said that they [...] "could tell certainly that we were getting something very special. It was outstanding film day in and day out." [...] Welles gave Wise detailed instructions and was usually not present during the film's editing. The film was very well planned out and intentionally shot for such post-production techniques as slow dissolves. The lack of coverage made editing easy since Welles and Toland edited the film [...] "in camera" [...] by leaving few options of how it could be put together. Wise said the breakfast table sequence took weeks to edit and get the correct [...] "timing" [...] and [...] "rhythm" [...] for the <b>whip</b> <b>pans</b> and over-lapping dialogue. The News on the March sequence was edited by RKO's newsreel division to give it authenticity. They used stock footage from Pathé News and the General Film Library.|$|R
500|$|... "Subway" [...] {{was shot}} by Alex Zakrzewski, the series' regular {{director}} of photography. The episode was staged so that Pembleton is initially keeping his distance from Lange, but gradually moves closer and closer as they begin to bond, {{and by the end}} is sitting next to him and holding his hand. Accordingly, the initial scenes included wider shots with Braugher and D'Onofrio on the outer edges of the frame, but later scenes included more close-ups of the two sitting together. Although Homicide: Life on the Street typically employs a number of back-and-forth whip pan-style cuts, Fleder asked that the style be modified for this episode. In earlier scenes, Fleder asked for wider long shots {{to create a sense of}} setting within the subway station, and as the episode progressed and the story became more intense, he then allowed more close-ups and <b>whip</b> <b>pans.</b> This led to disagreements on the set between Fleder and Zakrzewski, who felt Fleder was trying to being too disruptive and difficult. Fleder said of his behavior, [...] "I have to admit, I'm not the most charming guy on the set. I'm just not. When I'm on the set, I'm very focused and my humor goes away and I become not so charming." [...] After the episode was complete, Fleder said that he and Zakrzewski settled their differences and were both happy with the final result.|$|R
