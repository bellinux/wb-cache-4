25|$|Both {{remains and}} artistic depictions of horses have been {{discovered}} at Cucuteni-Trypillia sites. However, whether these finds are of domesticated or wild horses is debated. Before they were domesticated, humans hunted wild horses for meat. On the other hand, one hypothesis of horse domestication places it in the steppe region adjacent to the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture {{at roughly the same}} time (4000–3500 BC), so it is possible the culture was familiar with the domestic horse. At this time horses could have been kept both for meat or as a <b>work</b> <b>animal.</b> The direct evidence remains inconclusive.|$|E
2500|$|Animal husbandry, {{seen as a}} sign {{of power}} and wealth in the works of Homer, was in fact not well {{developed}} in ancient Greece. While the Mycenaean civilization was familiar with the rearing of cattle, the practice was restricted as a result of geographic expansion into less suitable terrain. Goats and sheep quickly became the most common livestock; less difficult to raise and providers of meat, wool, and milk (usually in the form of cheese). Pork and poultry (chicken and geese) were also raised. Oxen were rare and normally used as a <b>work</b> <b>animal,</b> though they were occasionally used as sacrificial animals (see Hecatomb). [...] Donkeys, mules and their mixes were raised as pack or draught animals.|$|E

Every part of him ached. He tramped on raw blisters; yet even this was easier than the fearful bruising his feet received on the water-rounded rocks of the Dyea Flats, across which the trail led for two miles. These two miles represented thirty-eight miles of travelling. He washed his face once a day. His nails, torn and broken and afflicted with hangnails, were never cleaned. His shoulders and chest, galled by the pack-straps, made him think, {{and for the first}} time with understanding, of the horses he had seen on city streets.|$|E

Poultry products such as chicken, duck, and goose are also raised but in limited number and for household consumption only. Raising poultry products is a way of subsidizing the basic needs of the people. Raising livestock like chicken is becoming very discouraging due to lack of knowledge on controlling disease of this livestock. Livestock like carabao and cows are in some cases raised in the community by some well off families, farmers and landlord in limited quantity and mainly as <b>work</b> <b>animal</b> or some times for rent.|$|E
