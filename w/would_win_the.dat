5|$|Florida State {{defeated}} Virginia Tech, 2722 in {{the first}} ACC Championship game. The following year, the game, held in Jacksonville, Florida, pitted Wake Forest against Georgia Tech, with Wake Forest winning 96.

5000|$|The {{principle}} of restricted choice is general but this specific probability calculation does suppose East <b>would</b> <b>win</b> with <b>the</b> king from KQ precisely {{half the time}} (which is best). If East <b>would</b> <b>win</b> with <b>the</b> king from KQ {{more or less than}} half the time, then South wins more or less than 35% by playing the ace. Indeed, if East <b>would</b> <b>win</b> with <b>the</b> king 92% of the time (=6.22/6.78), then South wins 50% by playing the ace and 50% by repeating the finesse. If that is true, however, South wins almost 100% by repeating the finesse after East <b>wins</b> with <b>the</b> queen [...] - [...] for the queen from that East player almost denies the king.|$|R

He did not score any goals that whole season but was vital. While he believed that Real Madrid <b>would</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> league, the club only managed to win the Copa del Rey.|$|E
5|$|In early September 1926, {{thousands}} of Cleveland fans, confident that their Indians <b>would</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> pennant {{even when they}} trailed the Yankees by six games, made World Series ticket reservations. By September 23, the Indians were only two games behind New York, but then lost three of their final four games to finish the season three games behind.|$|E

5|$|It was {{considered}} unlikely that Liverpool <b>would</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> league. Despite scoring the most goals and conceding the fewest {{in the top}} three, they drew four matches more than second place Newcastle.

On April 24, 1917 Yankee pitcher George Mogridge threw a no-hitter at Fenway Park, {{the first in}} the ball park's history and first in Yankee history. It would also {{turn out to be the}} Yankees' only no-hitter where they allowed a run as they <b>would</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> game, 2–1.|$|E
50|$|After this, two (or more) {{members of}} the Grudge Match Staff write their {{commentary}} on who they believe <b>would</b> <b>win,</b> in <b>the</b> form of an organized debate. First one commentator argues why his pick <b>would</b> <b>win,</b> then <b>the</b> second rebuffs the first and provides his own arguments, then the first debates further, and finally the second wraps it up. The commentary is analytical but often delves into nit-picking, bizarre cross-referencing, and personal jabs.|$|R

5|$|After winning {{back to back}} Presidents' Trophies {{in prior}} seasons the Canucks were {{projected}} as Stanley Cup contenders.

The Hockey News predicted that the Canucks <b>would</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> Northwest Division and finish as the second place team in the Western Conference.|$|E
5|$|An Advisory Committee on Uranium {{was formed}} under Lyman J. Briggs, a {{scientist}} {{and the director}} of the National Bureau of Standards. Its first meeting on October 21, 1939, was attended by Szilard, Teller, and Wigner, who persuaded the Army and Navy to provide $6,000 for Szilard to purchase supplies for experiments—in particular, more graphite. A 1940 Army intelligence report on Fermi and Szilard, prepared when the United States had not yet entered World War II, expressed reservations about both. While it contained some errors of fact about Szilard, it correctly noted his dire prediction that Germany <b>would</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> war.|$|E
