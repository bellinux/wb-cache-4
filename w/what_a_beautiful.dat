Do you believe in God? I doubt that you believe in Him and that love humanity, if you would, then you wouldn't lead his unfortunate soldiers right here to a senseless slaughter, and to certain death, {{and you would have}} spared them, their wives and children, and made them to live quietly at home instead of having led them such a distance because of the pernicious whims of your king.|$|E

500|$|When [...] "Pyramids" [...] {{was first}} released, it debuted within a promotional video {{less than two}} minutes long. The clip {{consists}} of an extended shot of a car, which flickers slightly with [...] "otherworldly effects" [...] while a [...] "slinky soul tune plays in the background." [...] The video was directed by Nabil Elderkin, who also helmed the music videos for past Ocean singles such as [...] "Swim Good" [...] and [...] "Novacane". A portion of the song was used during television commercials advertising Channel Orange, which began airing following the 2012 BET Awards. Siân Rowe of NME mused that the song will definitely get an outing on his upcoming US tour; [...] "Imagine lots of dry ice, a velvet-covered rotating stage and the entire front row sighing, 'I love you, Frank', <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> sight." [...] Ocean performed the track during his 14 show Channel Orange Tour through North America.|$|E

On the same day, Al Sharpton led a countermarch, called Reclaim the Dream, {{to mark the}} 47th anniversary of the {{historic}} Great March on Washington. According to New York Magazine, discussion for a satirical public event in response took place behind the scenes at Stewart's The Daily Show as early as August 12. Stewart has stated that the rally was never {{intended to be a}} means to counter Glenn Beck, but was simply another format for his and Colbert's style of humor, saying [...] "We saw [...] and thought, 'What a beautiful outline. <b>What</b> <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> structure to fill with what we want to express in live form, festival form.'" [...] Before any public discussion by Stewart, Colbert, or their staffs, members of the social news website Reddit independently began to discuss the possibility of a Colbert-led rally, often referred to as a [...] "Restoring Truthiness Rally". After the rallies were announced, some news articles credited Reddit for the idea. The rally was produced by Stewart's Busboy Productions.|$|E

25|$|The koinophilia {{hypothesis}} {{is supported by}} the findings of Judith Langlois and her co-workers. They found that the average of two human faces was more attractive than either of the faces from which that average was derived. The more faces (of the same gender and age) that were used in the averaging process the more attractive and appealing the average face became.

[...] Critics allege that he was endorsing the practice of [...] "necklacing" [...] opposition activists – placing a gasoline-soaked tire around a person's neck and setting the tire ablaze – others argue he was actually speaking about people using the constitution to empower themselves. Earlier in the speech he is quoted as saying [...] "Your tool in hand, your instrument in hand, your constitution in hand! Don't hesitate to give him what he deserves.

[...] "I wanted to come back and make it here, where I'm from, and show <b>what</b> <b>an</b> amazing, <b>beautiful</b> place it is", she said.

2500|$|Todd {{had been}} wrong; the show opened on Broadway to raves from the critics, sold out, {{and won a}} special Pulitzer Prize. Brooks Atkinson wrote in The New York Times that the show's opening number, [...] "Oh, <b>What</b> <b>a</b> <b>Beautiful</b> Mornin'" [...] changed the history of musical theater: “After a verse like that, sung to a buoyant melody, the banalities of the old musical stage became intolerable." [...] The New York Post was the only major paper to give Oklahoma! a mixed review. [...] Its critic felt that while the songs were {{pleasant}} enough, they sounded much alike. [...] The show's creativity stimulated Rodgers and Hammerstein's contemporaries and ushered in the [...] "Golden Age" [...] of American musical theatre.|$|E
40|$|Literary appreciation, {{just like}} {{literary}} production, is both cultural and environmental. A critic usually appreciates {{a work of}} art depending on how he or she was socialised. For {{a work of art}} to be considered beautiful, it is cultural. Hence, what can be beautiful in one culture may be viewed as ugly in another. In Shona people’s cosmology, it is clear <b>what</b> for example, <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> woman or <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> tree is. It is this concept of beauty, which is even exploited by the Shona in their appreciation of works of art. What the people view as <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> or good work of art is quite the same as what they regard as <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> woman or <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> tree. This paper seeks to show that Shona literary appreciation is both inspired and informed by the people’s social concept of beauty. This social-literary beauty interface will be explored using examples and extracts from Shona folktales, proverbs, prose and poetry...|$|R

50|$|A {{third major}} {{topic in the}} study of {{aesthetic}} judgments is how they are unified across art forms. We can call a person, a house, a symphony, a fragrance, and <b>a</b> mathematical proof <b>beautiful.</b> <b>What</b> characteristics do they share which give them that status? What possible feature could a proof and a fragrance both share in virtue of which they both count as <b>beautiful?</b> <b>What</b> makes <b>a</b> painting <b>beautiful</b> is quite different from what makes music beautiful, which suggests that each art form has its own language for the judgement of aesthetics.|$|R
