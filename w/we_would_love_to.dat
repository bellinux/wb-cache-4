40|$|We believe science {{students}} are more motivated to practice communication skills {{in the context of}} science. Additionally, colleagues told us they would prefer using science-specific instructional materials for teaching writing. Thus, faculty, staff, and students from the Faculty of Science and the Writing Centre at the University of British Columbia collaborated to create science-specific writing learning resources for students and educators. The resources are available on our website www. scwrl. ubc. ca. We focused on issues specific to communicating scientific information. Student resources include advice about communicating science; learning strategies for communicating science; finding, identifying, and citing sources; grammar and style; and developing an effective writing process. Resources include short YouTube videos, worksheets, background readings, and assessments. Educators are able to use our site to learn more about strategies for teaching writing and grading techniques. Included are eleven class-tested lessons with pre-class, in-class, and post-class activities, grading keys, and rubrics that educators can adopt or modify. Lesson topics (e. g. active and passive voice and communicating uncertainty) span writing style and grammar to audiences for scientific communication. The resources can be used individually or as part of a learning sequence. Our preliminary testing and our efforts to disseminate these resources initially locally encouraged us to share them with the broader science education community. Please visit our poster to learn more about our site and exchange ideas on science writing. <b>We</b> <b>would</b> also <b>love</b> <b>to</b> hear from you about additional resources you would find useful as we plan to expand our offerings...|$|R
