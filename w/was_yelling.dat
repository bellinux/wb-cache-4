25|$|Kim Phúc and {{her family}} were {{residents}} of the village of Trang Bang, South Vietnam. On June 8, 1972, South Vietnamese planes dropped a napalm bomb on Trang Bang, which had been attacked and occupied by North Vietnamese forces. Kim Phúc joined a group of civilians and South Vietnamese soldiers who were fleeing from the Caodai Temple {{to the safety of}} South Vietnamese-held positions. A Republic of Vietnam Air Force pilot mistook the group for enemy soldiers and diverted to attack. The bombing killed two of Kim Phúc's cousins and two other villagers. Kim Phúc was badly burned and tore off her burning clothes. Associated Press photographer Nick Ut's photograph of Kim Phúc running naked amid other fleeing villagers, South Vietnamese soldiers and press photographers {{became one of the most}} haunting images of the Vietnam War. In an interview many years later, she recalled she <b>was</b> <b>yelling,</b> Nóng quá, nóng quá ("too hot, too hot") in the picture. New York Times editors were at first hesitant to consider the photo for publication because of the nudity, but eventually approved it. A cropped version of the photo—with the press photographers to the right removed—was featured on the front page of The New York Times the next day. It later earned a Pulitzer Prize and was chosen as the World Press Photo of the Year for 1973.|$|E
500|$|During the night, the {{survivors}} of the Japanese 3rd Company, about 150 men, attempted to break out of their pocket and cross the sandbar {{at the mouth of the}} Matanikau. The 3rd Company soldiers overran two platoons from the 1st Raiders, who were not expecting an attack from that direction, and the resulting hand-to-hand melee left 12 Marines and 59 Japanese dead. The remaining 3rd Company survivors were able to cross the river and reach friendly lines. According to Frank J. Guidone, a Marine participant in the engagement, [...] "The fight was hours of hell. There <b>was</b> <b>yelling,</b> screams of the wounded and dying; rifle firing and machine guns with tracers piercing the night–(a) combination of fog, smoke, and the natural darkness. Truly an arena of death." ...|$|E
500|$|Shooting for {{the episode}} was a {{departure}} from the norm of the series, {{due to the fact that}} filming was not on the Dunder Mifflin set. Furthermore, the episode was not filmed during the day, but rather during the night, from 6pm to 6am. Principal filming took place in Long Beach Harbor, California. Because the episode took place on an actual boat, many cast members got sea sick. Rainn Wilson got especially nauseated on the second night; Jenna Fischer and David Denman felt nauseated on the last night of shooting. During the final sound mixing for the episode, Greg Daniels recalls yelling at the shot of Jim and Pam on deck. He noted that he had [...] "seen it many, many times, but I <b>was</b> <b>yelling,</b> 'Do it, you idiot! Kiss her!'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Raiden was {{voiced by}} Midway {{employee}} Jon Hey {{in the first}} two games. He became well known for yelling randomly while performing his [...] "Torpedo" [...] move (aka [...] "Superman move). Fans originally believed that he <b>was</b> <b>yelling</b> in Japanese, while others believed it to be mangled English phrases such as [...] "Your momma's from LA", or [...] "Get back in the car." [...] John Tobias revealed that Raiden was merely speaking gibberish and not actual Japanese or English.|$|E
2500|$|Renzi was an {{opponent}} of embryonic stem cell research. In May 2005, he engaged in an argument on the House floor with Congressman Mark Kirk (R-IL). The argument ensued after Renzi had learned that Kirk and the moderate Republican Main Street Partnership commissioned secret polling in the districts of Renzi {{and other members of}} Congress who oppose stem cell research. Renzi said, [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>yelling</b> at him. I told him it's absolutely unprecedented that Republicans would pay for a push poll to attack another Republican on such a core belief of mine... You're not going to change my view on the issue, as a father of 12." ...|$|E

60|$|With a grim {{certainty}} of his {{mastery of the}} situation Ken threw a huge potato at his leading pursuer. Fair and square on the bronze head it struck with a sharp crack. Like a tenpin the Soph went down. He plumped into the next two fellows, knocking them off their slippery footing. The three fell helplessly and piled up their comrades in a dense wedge half-way down the steps. If the Sophs had <b>been</b> <b>yelling</b> before, it <b>was</b> strange to note how they <b>were</b> <b>yelling</b> now.|$|R
2500|$|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas {{underwent}} preview test screenings – {{a process}} that Gilliam does not enjoy. [...] "I always get very tense in those (test screenings), because I'm ready to fight. I know the pressure from the studio is, 'somebody didn't like that, change it! The filmmaker {{said that it was}} important to him that Thompson like the film and recalls the writer's reaction at a screening, [...] "Hunter watched it for the first time at the premiere and he was making all this fucking noise! Apparently it all came flooding back to him, he was reliving the whole trip! He <b>was</b> <b>yelling</b> out and jumping on his seat like it was a roller coaster, ducking and diving, shouting 'SHIT! LOOK OUT! GODDAMN BATS!' That was fantastic – if he thought we'd captured it, then we must have done it!" [...] Thompson himself stated, [...] "Yeah, I liked it. It's not my show, but I appreciated it. Depp did a hell of a job. His narration is what really held the film together, I think. If you hadn't had that, it would have just been a series of wild scenes." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Jackson {{returned}} to the role, he was given multiple emotional storylines that continually put Lucky in tragic situations. As Jackson resumed the character in October 2009, Lucky is unaware that Elizabeth, his fiancée again, is {{having an affair with}} his brother Nikolas. What started as a joke grows into a physical relationship the same night Elizabeth accepts Lucky's remarriage proposal. Herbst explained to Comcast: [...] "I truly believe that [...] is in love with Lucky and has been in love with him her entire life. But what happened with Nikolas caught her by surprise as much as everybody else. It's hard for her to articulate it. She just knows that Nikolas did make her feel more like a woman and that in her relationship with Lucky she's very much still that 16-year-old girl that constantly needs to be saved. That's kind of the role that Lucky has played in her life." [...] When Lucky eventually walks in on her with Nikolas, he does not say anything and instead trashes his house and resumes drinking. J Bernard Jones from entertainment website Zap2it described that Lucky: [...] "generally was an emotional wreck, careening all over the place like a pinball. On the other hand, whenever Lucky was with Elizabeth or Nikolas he was cold and detached, imbuing just enough of Jackson's trademark sincerity (some would say over-earnestness) to knock the two cheatin' hearts off-kilter." [...] Lucky is irate by the time he confronts them. Herbst described the scene: [...] "Jonathan actually seemed like one more step {{and he was going to}} take my head off. Honestly, it was not so hard to be present when he <b>was</b> <b>yelling</b> at me like he did." [...] Jones from Zap2it stated that in the confrontation scenes: [...] "Jackson accomplished a much harder task than simply reclaiming the Lucky mantle: he has bridged the gap between his previous run, Jacob Young's and most recently, Greg Vaughan's. Now Lucky seems like a whole person once again, as opposed to a fractured character sliced up over the years by the writers, and fractured by fan loyalties." [...] Lucky, Nikolas and Elizabeth soon learn that Elizabeth is pregnant, and either brother could be the father. Jackson explained Lucky's position: ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{production}} went on, {{the slow}} pace and daily mental and physical strain of filming began to wear on the cast and crew. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio remembered, [...] "We never started and finished any one scene in any one day". At one point, Cameron told the actors to relieve themselves in their wetsuits to save time between takes. While filming one of many takes of Mastrantonio's character's resuscitation scene- {{in which she was}} soaking wet, topless and repeatedly being slapped and pounded on the chest- the camera ran out of film, prompting Mastrantonio to storm off the set yelling, [...] "We are not animals!" [...] For some shots in the scene that focus on Ed Harris, he <b>was</b> <b>yelling</b> at thin air because Mastrantonio refused to film the scene again. Michael Biehn also grew frustrated by the waiting. He claimed that he was in South Carolina for five months and only acted for three to four weeks. He remembered one day being ten meters underwater and [...] "suddenly the lights went out. It was so black I couldn't see my hand. I couldn't surface. I realized I might not get out of there." [...] Harris recalled: [...] "One day we were all in our dressing rooms and people began throwing couches out the windows and smashing the walls. We just had to get our frustrations out." [...] Cameron responded to these complaints, saying, [...] "For every hour they spent {{trying to figure out what}} magazine to read, we spent an hour at the bottom of the tank breathing compressed air." [...] After 140 days and $4 million over budget, filming finally wrapped on December 8, 1988. Before the film's release, there were reports from South Carolina that Ed Harris was so upset by the physical demands of the film and Cameron's dictatorial directing style that he said he would refuse to help promote the motion picture. Harris later denied this rumor and helped promote the film. But after its release and initial promotion, Harris publicly refused to ever again discuss the film, saying [...] "I'm never talking about it and never will." [...] Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio has also since brushed off the film, commenting, [...] "The Abyss was a lot of things. Fun to make is not one of them." ...|$|E
