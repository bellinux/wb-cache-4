30|$|Near-infrared (NIR) {{spectroscopy}} {{has been}} shown to be a promising technique for the rapid assessment of many physical and chemical properties of wood [14, 15], thereby allowing the use of NIR-based technology in the forest products industry [16]. For the assessment of LGS, Baillères et al. [17, 18] demonstrated that NIR spectroscopy could be used to predict LGS of ground <b>wood-meal</b> of hybridized eucalyptus full-sib families at the moisture content of 6 %. They also suggested that LGS depends closely on the chemical composition of wood, and that, because of this, the prediction of LGS was successful. If NIR spectroscopy has a potential to predict LGS of wet solid wood, it could be applied for a rapid non-destructive evaluation of the surface LGS of standing trees or green logs. However, to the best of our knowledge, few studies have focused on predicting LGS of wet wood using NIR spectroscopy. The aim of this study was to examine if NIR spectroscopy has a potential to predict the surface LGS of green logs. The relationship between NIR spectra and wood properties associated with LGS was also discussed.|$|E
40|$|Alkali lignin was {{prepared}} oy heating thoroughly extracted spruce <b>wood-meal</b> in an autoclave with 4 % NaOH for 1 hour at 172 °. The crude product, on purification by precipitation from dioxan into ether was separated into two homogeneous fractions, Alkali Lignin A, insoluble in dioxan-ether, and Alkali Lignin B, soluble in dioxan-ether. Alkali Lignin A condensed with both 0 - and p-bromphenol {{to form the}} corresponding substituted phenyl ethers, which gave identical analyses. On {{the basis of the}} bromine content of these condensation products, Alkali Lignin A corresponds to the empirical formula C 67 H 7 l 023 (m. w. = 1244), and contains, as shown from the analyses of its acetylated and methylated derivatives, 6 methoxyl groups, 3 phenolic, and 4 aliphatic hydroxyl groups. Alkali Lignin A also condensed with two molecules of phenol, one in ether condensation, the other in nuclear condensation. This Phenol Alkali Lignin A has an empirical formula C 79 HSI 024, and contains 6 methoxyl groups, 6 phenolic and 3 aliphatic hydroxyl groups, as likewise shown from its derivatives. The absence of carbonyl groups in both Alkali Lignin A and Phenol Alkali Lignin A was shown by the inability of the fully meLhylated derivatives to form methyl esters with diazomethane. On treatment with MeOH-HC 1, tne methoxyl content of Alkali Lignin A increased by an amount corresponding to the introduction of two methoxyl groups. The smallest building unit for Alkali Lignin B corresponds to the formula CIOgHl 07037, with a m. w. of 1996 and containing 9 methoxyl groups, g phenolic, and 3 aliphatic hydroxyl groups.
