6000|$|Thus when, in {{his last}} delirium, the Pope uttered some such words as: [...] "I am coming; I am coming. It is just. But wait a little," [...] and when those words were repeated, it was {{straightway}} asserted that the Devil was the being he thus addressed in that supreme hour. The story grew in detail; that is inevitable with such matter. He had bargained with the devil, it was said, for a pontificate of twelve years, and, the time being completed, the devil was come for him. And presently, <b>we</b> <b>even</b> <b>have</b> a description of Messer the Devil as he appeared on that occasion--in {{the shape of a}} baboon. The Marquis Gonzaga of Mantua, in all seriousness, writes to relate this. The chronicler Sanuto, receiving the now popularly current story from another source, in all seriousness gives it place in his Diarii, thus: ...|$|E
60|$|Let us further remember, {{that during}} this same period there was a limited {{knowledge}} of chemistry. The many arts which we know to have been carried on must have been impossible without a generalised experience of the modes in which certain bodies affect each other under special conditions. In metallurgy, which was extensively practised, this is abundantly illustrated. And <b>we</b> <b>even</b> <b>have</b> evidence {{that in some cases}} the knowledge possessed was, in a sense, quantitative. For, as we find by analysis that the hard alloy of which the Egyptians made their cutting tools, was composed of copper and tin in fixed proportions, there must have been an established prevision that such an alloy was to be obtained only by mixing them in these proportions. It is true, this was but a simple empirical generalisation; but so was the generalisation respecting the recurrence of eclipses; so are the first generalisations of every science.|$|E

5000|$|The {{success of}} the group's debut led to a {{recording}} contract with Island Records, an English label which had an American distribution deal with Cotillion Records, a subsidiary of Atlantic, itself owned by Ahmet Ertegun. Emerson believed that Ertegun agreed to take the band on [...] "because we could sell out 20,000-seaters before <b>we</b> <b>even</b> <b>had</b> a record out.

5000|$|The third BIOS {{virus was}} a {{technique}} called [...] "Persistent BIOS infection." [...] It appeared in 2009 at the CanSecWest Security Conference in Vancouver, and at the SyScan Security Conference in Singapore. Researchers Anibal Sacco and Alfredo Ortega, from Core Security Technologies, demonstrated how to insert malicious code into the decompression routines in the BIOS, allowing for nearly full control of the PC at start-up, even before the operating system is booted. The proof-of-concept does not exploit a flaw in the BIOS implementation, but only involves the normal BIOS flashing procedures. Thus, it requires physical access to the machine, or for the user to be root. Despite these requirements, Ortega underlined the profound implications of his and Sacco's discovery: [...] "We can patch a driver to drop a fully working rootkit. <b>We</b> <b>even</b> <b>have</b> a little code that can remove or disable antivirus." ...|$|E
50|$|After the {{collapse}} of Sargon's state, Lagash again thrived under its independent kings (ensis), Ur-Baba and Gudea, and had extensive commercial communications with distant realms. According to his own records, Gudea brought cedars from the Amanus and Lebanon mountains in Syria, diorite from eastern Arabia, copper and gold from central and southern Arabia, while his armies were engaged in battles with Elam on the east. His was especially the era of artistic development. <b>We</b> <b>even</b> <b>have</b> a fairly {{good idea of what}} Gudea looked like, since he placed in temples throughout his city numerous statues or idols depicting himself with lifelike realism, (Statues of Gudea). At the time of Gudea, the capital of Lagash was actually in Girsu. The kingdom covered an area of approximately 1600 km2. It contained 17 larger cities, eight district capitals, and numerous villages (about 40 known by name). According to one estimate, Lagash was the largest city in the world from ca. 2075 to 2030 BC.|$|E
