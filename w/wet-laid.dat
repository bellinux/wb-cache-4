50|$|<b>Wet-laid,</b> or damp, {{walls are}} made by using the mud or clay mixture {{directly}} without forming blocks and drying them first. The amount of and type of each material in the mixture used leads to different styles of buildings. The deciding factor is usually connected {{with the quality of}} the soil being used. Larger amounts of clay are usually employed in building with cob, while low-clay soil is usually associated with sod house or sod roof construction. The other main ingredients include more or less sand/gravel and straw/grasses. Rammed earth is both an old and newer take on creating walls, once made by compacting clay soils between planks by hand; nowadays forms and mechanical pneumatic compressors are used.|$|E
40|$|Non-woven textile mesh from {{polyglycolic}} acid (PGA) was found as a proper material for chondrocyte adhesion but worse for their proliferation. Neither hyaluronic acid nor chitosan nor polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) increased chondrocyte adhesion. However, chondrocyte proliferation suffered from acidic byproducts of PGA degradation. Addition of PVA and/or chitosan into a <b>wet-laid</b> non-woven textile mesh from PGA, however, improved chondrocyte proliferation seeded in vitro on the PGA-based composite scaffold namely {{due to a}} diminished acidification of their microenvironment. This PVA/PGA composite mesh used in combination with a proper hydrogel minimized the negative effect of PGA degradation without dropping positive parameters of the PGA <b>wet-laid</b> non-woven textile mesh. In fact, presence of PVA and/or chitosan in the PGA-based <b>wet-laid</b> non-woven textile mesh even advanced the PGA-based wetlaid non-woven textile mesh for chondrocyte seeding and artificial cartilage production due to a positive effect of PVA in such a scaffold on chondrocyte proliferation.

40|$|Optimizing {{the desired}} {{properties}} for stretch monolayer separators used in Lithium-ion batteries {{has been a}} challenge. In the present study a cellulose nanofiber/PET nonwoven composite separator is successfully fabricated, using a <b>wet-laid</b> nonwoven (papermaking) process, which can attain optimal properties in wettability, mechanical strength, thermal resistance, and electrochemical performance simultaneously. The PET nonwoven material, which is fabricated from ultrafine PET fibers by a <b>wet-laid</b> process, is a mechanical support layer. The porous structure of the composite separator was created by cellulose nanofibers coating the PET in a papermaking process. Cellulose nanofibers (CNFs), which are an eco-friendly sustainable resource, have been drawing considerable attention due to their astounding properties, such as: incredible specific surface area, thermal and chemical stability, high mechanical strength and hydrophilicity. The {{results show that the}} CNF separator exhibits higher porosity (70 %) than a PP (polypropylene) separator (40 %). The CNF separator can also be wetted by electrolyte in a few seconds while a PP separator cannot be entirely wetted after 1 min. The CNF separator has an electrolyte uptake of 250 %, while a PP separator has only 65 %. Another notable finding is that the CNF separator has almost no shrinkage when exposed to 180 °C for 1 h, whereas a PP separator shrinks by more than 50 %. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) shows that the CNF separator has a higher melting point than a PP separator. These findings all indicate that the CNF 29 separator will be more favorable than stretch film for use in Lithium-ion batteries...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} micro-structure {{models of}} <b>wet-laid</b> conductive nonwoven fabrics allowing the sheet conductance and shielding effectiveness to be simulated and compared to experimental measurement. Conductive nonwoven fabrics are used within the aerospace and defence industries to provide lightweight, functional electromagnetic enhancement to composite structures. They are materials borne from stochastic processes with anisotropic distributions of fibre and parameters that vary from {{point to point}} on the local scale. Monte Carlo models of the material’s micro-structure have been constructed by writing a series of algorithms which pseudo-randomly generate the material’s structure by incorporating key physical parameters such as the density, areal concentration and fibre angle distribution. To define the last of these parameters, a completely new optical method has been developed making use of the Hough Transform. These models have predicted the anisotropic sheet conductance to within 1 - 2...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access. The {{potential}} for manufacturing a nonwoven preform for composites using blends {{of glass and}} low melt polyester or bicomponent sheath/core (polyester/polyethylene) fibers is demonstrated. Wet-lay webs were hydroentangled to form strong, flexible preforms that could be easily manipulated {{for the production of}} compression molded composites. An appropriate white water recipe for dispersing glass and binder fibers was critical to the formation of good quality webs. Optimal dispersion times were determined experimentally by examining the total number of defects present in hand sheet samples. To achieve the required web density, several <b>wet-laid</b> sheets were stacked and hydroentangled into a single sheet. This final sheet structure was subsequently heat pressed in a mold to achieve the final form. Forming temperatures producing binder fiber melting and a rigid uniform composite were selected.

40|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) {{conducted}} {{joint research}} to evaluate explosion blast effects on typical U. S. mine ventilation stoppings in the NIOSH Pittsburgh Research Laboratory 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s (PRL) Lake Lynn Experimental Mine (LLEM). An innovative Australian-designed brattice stop-ping was also evaluated. After mine explosion accidents, MSHA conducts investigations {{to determine the}} cause(s) {{as a means to}} prevent future occurrences. As part of these postexplosion investigations, the condition of underground stoppings, including the debris from damaged stoppings, is documented as evidence of the approximate strength and the direction of the explosion forces. The LLEM data showed that a typical dry-stacked and coated solid-concrete-block stopping survived a total explosion pressure of 6. 7 psi (46 kPa) and was destroyed at a total explosion pressure of 7. 6 psi (52 kPa). In comparison, a typical dry-stacked and coated hollow-core concrete block stopping survived a total explosion pressure of 3. 4 - 4. 3 psi (23 - 30 kPa) and was destroyed at a total explosion pressure of 3. 6 - 5. 2 psi (25 - 36 kPa), depending on the length of the pressure pulse and the value of the pressure-time integral. A typical steel panel stopping design survived a total explosion pressure of 0. 8 psi (5. 5 kPa) and failed at a total explosion pressure of 1. 3 psi (9 kPa). The LLEM data also showed that an obstacle blocking the path of a pressure wave resulted in a higher reflected pressure at the obstacle. An 8 -in (20 -cm) thick <b>wet-laid</b> solid-concrete-block stopping coated on one side survived a total explosion pressure of 26 psi (180 kPa); this stopping was not tested to failure. A 6 -in (15 -cm) thick <b>wet-laid</b> solid-concrete-block stopping coated on one side survived a total explosion pressure of 14 psi (97 kPa) and was destroyed at a total explosion pressure of 25 psi (172 kPa). An innovative Australian woven cloth stopping survived an explosion pressure of 4. 0 psi (27 kPa) and was destroyed at an explosion pressure of 6. 1 psi (42 kPa). These results will help investigators determine the approximate explosion forces that destroy or damage stoppings during actual coal mine explosions...|$|E
40|$|The {{main focus}} of this {{research}} is to make a composite of sufficient strength from glass fibers using low melt polyester or bicomponent (polyester/polyethylene sheath/core) fibers as binder fibers for nonwoven preforms. A <b>wet-laid</b> hydroentangled sheet consisting of a blend of glass and low melt binder fibers is used to make compression molded composite. An appropriate white water recipe for dispersing glass and binder fibers was obtained after personal conversation with Owens Corning Company and after image analysis of the trial sheets. The amount of defects in the fabric was analyzed and optimum time of dispersion was established. 6 layers of wet lay sheets were stacked and hydroentangled to get a high weight per unit length single hydroentangled sheet that is then heat pressed. When heat pressed, the binder fibers in the blend melt, adhere to the glass fibers and form a composite. These composites were tested for stiffness, toughness and flexural strength. An instron machine was used for tensile and 4 -point bending tests. Stress strain curves were obtained and the secant modulus at breaking strain was determined.

40|$|A {{variety of}} nano-TiO 2 /cellulose {{composite}} fibers (TiO 2 /CF) were synthesized via both in situ growing rutile TiO 2 nanocrystals and electrostatic self-assembly of commercial nano rutile TiO 2 particles onto cellulose fibers. These fibers were then processed into fibrous membrane beds by <b>wet-laid</b> technique. Dynamic adsorption of lead (Pb 2 +) was subsequently {{carried out by}} pumping the feed solution through the bed in a single-pass flow mode. The influence of various parameters including flow rate, bed height and bed stacking pattern on bed breakthrough behavior was investigated. It {{was found that the}} in situ-TiO 2 /CF bed outperformed others; its loading capacity of Pb 2 + was 13 times that of pure CF bed, and 9 times that of the self-assembled TiO 2 /cellulose bed prior to 10 % breakthrough. The dynamic adsorption behavior of the in situ-TiO 2 /CF bed was better predicted by Dose Response model among other models tested. The bed was also selective for Pb 2 + over Ca 2 +, and was readily regenerable when eluted with 0. 1 M HCl solution for repeated use. The outstanding performance of the in situ-TiO 2 /CF bed was a result of larger fiber adsorption capacity and faster adsorption kinetics compared with the other beds having similar geometric bed structure.

40|$|Alzeta Corporation has {{developed}} surface-stabilized fuel injectors {{for use with}} lean premixed combustors which provide extended turndown and ultra-low NOX emission performance. These injectors use a patented technique to form interacting radiant and blue-flame zones immediately above a selectively-perforated porous metal surface. This allows stable operation at low reaction temperatures. This technology is being commercialized under the product name nanoSTAR. Initial tests demonstrated low NOX emissions but, were limited by flashback failure of the injectors. The weld seams required to form cylindrical injectors from flat sheet material were identified {{as the cause of}} the failures. The approach for this project was to first develop new fabrication methods to produce injectors without weld seams, verify similar emissions performance to the original flat sheet material and then develop products for microturbines and small gas turbines along parallel development paths. A 37 month project was completed to develop and test a surface stabilized combustion system for gas turbine applications. New fabrication techniques developed removed a technological barrier {{to the success of the}} product by elimination of conductive weld seams from the injector surface. The injectors demonstrated ultra low emissions in rig tests conducted under gas turbine operating conditions. The ability for injectors to share a common combustion chamber allowing for deployment in annular combustion liner was also demonstrated. Some further development is required to resolve integration issues related to specific engine constraints, but the nanoSTAR technology has clearly demonstrated its low emissions potential. The overall project conclusions can be summarized: (1) A <b>wet-laid</b> casting method successfully eliminated weld seams from the injector surface without degrading performance. (2) Gas turbine cycle analysis identified several injector designs and control schemes to start and load engines using nanoSTAR technology. A mechanically simple single zone injector can be used in Solar Turbine's Taurus 60 engine. (3) Rig testing of single monolithic injectors demonstrated sub 3 ppmv NOX and sub 10 ppmv CO and UHC emissions (all corrected to 15 % O 2) at Taurus 60 full-load pressure and combustion air inlet temperature. (4) Testing of two nanoSTAR injectors in Solar Turbine's sector rig demonstrated the ability for injectors to survive when fired in close proximity at Taurus 60 full load pressure and combustion air inlet temperature. (5) Sector rig tests demonstrated emissions performance and range of operability consistent with single injector rig tests. Alzeta has committed to the commercialization of nanoSTAR injectors and has sufficient production capability to conclude development and meet initial demand...|$|E
