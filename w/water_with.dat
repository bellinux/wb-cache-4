40|$|International audienceAdvanced {{oxidation}} processes {{based on}} UV radiations {{have been shown}} to be a promising wastewater disinfection technology. The UV-LED system involves innovative materials and could be an advantageous alternative to mercury-vapor lamps. The use of the UV-LED system results in good water quality meeting the legislative requirements relating to wastewater reuse for irrigation. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of <b>watering</b> <b>with</b> UV-LED treated wastewaters (UV-LED WW) on soil parameters. Solid-state C- 13 NMR shows that <b>watering</b> <b>with</b> UV-LED WW do not change the chemical composition of soil organic matter compared to soil <b>watered</b> <b>with</b> potable <b>water.</b> Regarding microbiological parameters, laccase, cellulase, protease and urease activities increase in soils <b>watered</b> <b>with</b> UV-LED WW which means that organic matter brought by the effluent is actively degraded by soil microorganisms. The functional diversity of soil microorganisms is not affected by <b>watering</b> <b>with</b> UV-LED WW when it is altered by 4 and 8 months of <b>watering</b> <b>with</b> wastewater (WW). After 12 months, functional diversity is similar regardless of the water used for watering. The persistence of faecal indicator bacteria (coliform and enterococci) was also determined and <b>watering</b> <b>with</b> UV-LED WW does not increase their number nor their diversity unlike soils irrigated with activated sludge wastewater. The study of watering-soil microcosms with UV-LED WW indicates that this system seems to be a promising alternative to the UV-lamp-treated wastewaters. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

5|$|In July 2009 it was {{announced}} that traces of ammonia had been found in the plumes during flybys in July and October 2008. Reducing the freezing point of <b>water</b> <b>with</b> ammonia would also allow for outgassing and higher gas pressure, and less heat required to power the water plumes. The subsurface layer heating the surface water ice could be an ammonia–water slurry at temperatures as low as , and thus less energy is required to produce the plume activity.|$|E

40|$|Perennial rhizomatous grasses are {{regarded}} as leading energy crops due to their environmental benefits and their suitability to regions with adverse conditions. In this paper, two different experiments were carried out in order to study the salinity (S) and water stress (WS) effects on biomass production in giant reed (Arundo donax L.). In Experiment 1, eight clones of giant reed were subjected to four salinity (S) and water stress (WS) treatments: (1) well <b>watered</b> <b>with</b> non-saline solution, (2) <b>water</b> stress <b>with</b> non-saline solution, (3) well <b>watered</b> <b>with</b> saline solution and 4) <b>water</b> stress <b>with</b> saline solution. In Experiment 2, five clones of giant reed were subjected to increasing S levels in two locations: University of Catania (UNICT-Italy) (1) well <b>watered</b> <b>with</b> non-saline solution and (2) well <b>watered</b> <b>with</b> mild saline solution; and University of Barcelona (UB-Spain) (3) well <b>watered</b> <b>with</b> non-saline solution and (4) well <b>watered</b> <b>with</b> severe saline solution. Photosynthetic and physiological parameters as well as biomass production were measured in these plants. According to our data, giant reed {{seems to be more}} tolerant to S than WS. Both stresses mainly affected stomatal closure to prevent dehydration of the plant, eventually decreasing the photosynthetic rate. The differential performance of the giant reed clones was ranked according to their tolerance to S and WS by using the Stress Susceptibility Index. 'Agrigento' was the most WS resistant clone and 'Martinensis' was the most S resistant. 'Martinensis' and 'Piccoplant' were found to be the most suitable clones for growing under both stress conditions. Moreover, 'Fondachello', 'Cefalú' and 'Licata' were the most resistant clones to increasing S levels...|$|R

5|$|The {{difference}} in the hearing ranges for octopus and bigfin reef squids {{may be explained by}} the {{difference in}} their habitats.

Hearing would thus be more important for the squids to escape predators. The ability to hear is particularly relevant for avoiding mammalian predators of the suborder Odontoceti (particularly dolphins), who use echolocation to find prey.|$|E
