5000|$|In 1996 {{they began}} another long {{standing}} {{working relationship with}} British electronic music duo The Chemical Brothers, making the video for Setting Sun the first single from their Dig Your Own Hole album. The track featured vocals from Noel Gallagher who was not available {{to appear in the}} video. Dom&nic's subsequent film was atypical of other dance music videos of the time. Taking the form of a narrative film which paid reverent attention to the music, it moved away from more abstract trends in the genre. The Setting Sun video [...] "Spies rave culture's flip from underground to overground {{through the eyes of a}} bewildered teenage girl" [...] as it follows her nightmarish out of body experience at an all night free party. It mixes unsettling psychological confusion with moments of humorous imagery, for example the terrified girl sees break dancing policemen. Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons played a cameo role as themselves leaving the party with their record cases. The cameo has become a tradition which continues in many of the Chemical Brothers' videos to date. Setting Sun received a number of award nominations including the MTV Breakthrough Video Award. When MTV announced a format shift away from alternative rock to electronica they cited the Setting Sun video as an inspiration. Dom&nic continued the narrative format for The Chemical Brothers with follow up videos for Block Rockin' Beats (1997) (nominated for the Brit Awards Best Music Video and the MTV Awards Best Dance Video), Hey Boy Hey Girl (1999) and Come with Us/The Test featuring vocals from The Verve's Richard Ashcroft (2002). In 2006 their video for Believe (released 2005) a track featuring vocals by Bloc Party's Kele Okereke won Best Music Video in both MTV Europe's Awards and the CAD's Music video awards. The video follows the psychological break down of a young car factory worker who believes he is being pursued by a <b>welding</b> <b>robot</b> from the factory. Dom&nic worked with visual effects company Framestore to bring the <b>welding</b> <b>robot</b> to life. In 2007 they worked with Framestore again to create an enormous cast of singing and dancing fish for the Chemical Brothers single The Salmon Dance featuring Vocals by Pharcyde rapper Fatlip. The Salmon Dance was nominated for MTV Europe's 2007 Video Star Award (which replaced the previous years' Best Video category). Dom&nic's most recent video for The Chemical Brothers is Midnight Madness, a choreographed dance piece that follows the realtime journey of a mischievous goblin-masked dancer. The gold sequinned goblin emerges from an industrial bin behind the London Astoria Theatre, climbs over a rooftop, breaks into the theatre and dances on stage before returning to the bin as the track finishes. Midnight Madness was nominated for best Dance Video at the 2008 UK Music Video Awards.|$|E

40|$|Though MIG <b>welding</b> <b>robots</b> are {{extensively}} {{applied in}} the automotive assemblies ‘Spot Welding’ {{is the most common}} welding application found in the auto stamping assembly manufacturing. Every manufacturing process is subject to variations – with resistance welding, these include; part fit up, part thickness variations, misaligned electrodes, variations in coating materials or thickness, sealers, weld force variations, shunting, machine tooling degradation; and slag and spatter damage. All welding gun tips undergo wear; an elemental part of the process. Though adaptive resistance welding control automatically compensates to keep production and quality up to the levels needed as gun tips undergo wear so that the welds remain reliable; the system cannot compensate for deterioration caused by the slag and spatter on the part holding fixtures, sensors, and gun tips. To cleanse <b>welding</b> <b>robots</b> of slag and spatter, dry-ice blasting has proven to be an effective remedy. Presently, CO 2 / dry ice blasting is being effectively used in a wide array of applications from heavy slag removal to delicate semiconductor and circuit board cleaning. This process can be used on-line without damaging equipment or requiring a machine "teardown". Unlike conventional toxic chemicals, high-pressure water blasting and abrasive grit blasting, CO 2 / dry ice blasting uses dry ice particles in a high velocity air flow to remove contaminates from surfaces without the added costs and inconvenience of secondary waste treatment and disposal. This paper describes MIG and Spot welding process and analyses the slag and spatter formation during robotic welding of stamping assemblies; and concludes that the dry ice blasting process’s utility in cleansing of <b>welding</b> <b>robots</b> in auto stamping plant operations is paramount and exigen...|$|R
