The [...] "go to work <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>parents</b> day" [...] idea appealed to Appel because it was {{something}} he [...] "lost the right" [...] to do when he went from public school to private school as a child. Appel considered those days to be his favorites because he [...] "didn't have to do anything" [...] at his parents' job. The idea of having a driver's license was something that Appel dreamed about when he was younger.|$|E

500|$|When {{starting}} {{out as a}} comedy writer, Appel recalled: [...] "One reason I caught up to my contemporaries is that when I started to send out my scripts, the idea that I'd been on the Lampoon, even 8 or 10 years before, was a credential I could use." [...] Appel got his first television job when David Mirkin hired him for the writing staff of The Simpsons in 1994, initially on a ten-week contract, {{and served as a}} writer and producer there for four years. There, he wrote seven episodes, often employing the use of [...] "joke sequences, a narrative approach to humor that eschews the quick laugh in favor of something that develops over time." [...] Appel found work on The Simpsons to be a learning curve because it was a [...] "very tough show to write for." [...] His first episode was season seven's [...] "Mother Simpson". Appel was desperately trying to think of a story idea to show and decided that he had to really reach out and opted to do something about Homer's mother, who previously had only been mentioned once. He named her Mona Simpson, after his wife. Many of the writers could not believe that an episode about Homer's mother had not previously been produced. The writers used the episode to solve several little puzzles, such as where Lisa's intelligence came from. Also for season seven he penned [...] "Bart on the Road", in which he utilized the plot devices of [...] "go to work <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>parents</b> day" [...] and Bart getting a driving license, and contributed to the episode [...] "22 Short Films About Springfield"; the two segments he wrote for the episode (one about Marge, the other about Lionel Hutz) were both cut. Appel wrote two episodes from season eight, [...] "Bart After Dark" [...] and [...] "The Secret War of Lisa Simpson", as well as season nine's [...] "The Two Mrs Nahasapeemapetilons" [...] and season 10's [...] "When You Dish Upon A Star".|$|E

60|$|My friends, let us try {{to follow}} his steps; let us {{remember}} all day long {{what it is to}} be MEN; that it is to have every one whom we meet for our brother in the sight of God; that it is this, never to meet any one, however bad he may be, for whom we cannot say, 'Christ died for that man, and Christ cares for him still. He is precious in God's eyes; he shall be precious in mine also.' Let us take the counsel of the Gospel for this day, and love one another, not in word merely--in doctrine, but in deed and in truth, really and actually; in our every-day lives and behaviour, words, looks--in all of them let us be cordial, feeling, pitiful, patient, courteous. Masters <b>with</b> <b>your</b> workmen, teachers <b>with</b> <b>your</b> pupils, <b>parents</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> children, be cordial, and kind, and patient; respect every one, whether below you or not in the world's eyes. Never do a thing to any human being which may lessen his self-respect; which may make him think that you look down upon him, and so make him look down upon himself in awkwardness and shyness; or else may make him start off from you, angry and proud, saying, 'I am as good as you; and if you keep apart from me, I will from you; if you can do without me, I can do without you. I want none of your condescension.' It is NOT so. You cannot do without each other. We can none of us do without the other; do not let us make any one fancy that he can, and tempt him to wrap himself up in pride and surliness, cutting himself off from the communion of saints, and the blessing of being a man among men.|$|R
