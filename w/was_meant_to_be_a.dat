5|$|Chrono Resurrection, {{also known}} as Chrono Trigger: Resurrection, is an {{unreleased}} fangame developed by North American team Resurrection Games under Nathan Lazur's direction. It {{is based on the}} critically acclaimed Super NES role-playing game Chrono Trigger by the Japanese company Square. The project was initially called CT64 and <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> complete remake of the original game for the Nintendo 64, with both 2D and 3D playing modes.|$|E
5|$|Having seized Emesa, the Muslims {{were just}} a march away from Aleppo, a Byzantine stronghold, and Antioch, where Heraclius resided. Seriously alarmed by the series of setbacks, Heraclius {{prepared}} for a counterattack to reacquire the lost regions. In 635 Yazdegerd III, the Emperor of Persia, sought an alliance with the Byzantine Emperor. Heraclius married off his daughter (according to traditions, his grand daughter) Manyanh to Yazdegerd III, to cement the alliance. While Heraclius prepared for a major offensive in the Levant, Yazdegerd was to mount a simultaneous counterattack in Iraq, in what <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> well-coordinated effort. When Heraclius launched his offensive in May 636, Yazdegerd could not coordinate with the maneuver—probably owing to the exhausted condition of his government—and {{what would have been}} a decisive plan missed the mark.|$|E
5|$|Queen Victoria had {{instructed}} the War Office {{to strike a}} new medal that would not recognise birth or class. The medal <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> simple decoration that would be highly prized and eagerly sought after by those in the military services. To maintain its simplicity, Queen Victoria, {{under the guidance of}} Prince Albert, vetoed the suggestion that the award be called The Military Order of Victoria and instead suggested the name Victoria Cross. The original warrant stated that the Victoria Cross would only be awarded to soldiers who have served {{in the presence of the}} enemy and had performed some signal act of valour or devotion. The first ceremony was held on 26 June 1857 at which Queen Victoria invested 62 of the 111 Crimean recipients in a ceremony in Hyde Park, London.|$|E

5000|$|Whereas in postmodern irony {{something}} <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> cynically mocked and {{not taken}} seriously, {{and in new}} sincerity something <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken seriously or [...] ""; post-irony combines these two elements by either (i) having something absurd taken seriously or (ii) <b>be</b> unclear as <b>to</b> whether something <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ironic. Over the years, {{it has become an}} increasingly common form of rhetoric on imageboards such as 4chan, 8chan, Krautchan, Ylilauta, and Circleboard.|$|R
5|$|Ralph and Vanellope build a kart, {{and they}} flee to Diet Cola Mountain, an {{unfinished}} race track. Learning that Vanellope cannot drive, Ralph helps teach her. King Candy hacks the game's code, obtaining Ralph's medal, which he offers {{to him in}} exchange for preventing Vanellope from racing. He explains that if Vanellope wins and becomes playable, her glitches would {{be brought to the}} attention of players, their game would be unplugged and Vanellope would die, unable to leave the game because she is a glitch. A reluctant Ralph agrees, trashing Vanellope's kart. He returns to his own game, but notices Vanellope's image on the side of the Sugar Rush cabinet, and realizes she <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> playable character.|$|E
5|$|The album {{revealed}} {{a more personal}} side of the singer, illustrated in its declarative theme of emancipation from her previous marriage, and from her personal and professional setbacks. Although it shared similar vocal production {{as well as an}} inclination to her signature pop and R ballads, the album also encompassed a variety of dance-oriented and uptempo styles. It <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> continuation, or a second part of her tenth studio album, The Emancipation of Mimi (2005). Carey collaborated with a number of artists on the album, including T-Pain, Damian Marley and Young Jeezy. Though considered by critics very similar to the formula its predecessor had been built on, E=MC² included other genres she had never explored, such as reggae, and her continued recording of gospel-influenced hymns.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the race's {{first week}} and {{beginning}} of its second were three hilly medium-mountain stages. These stages took the Giro through Austria and Switzerland before returning to Italy. Each of these stages took more than five hours to complete, and the rain that fell each day combined with the difficulties presented by the numerous ascents and descents made the courses potentially unsafe in the riders' opinion. This opinion was perhaps validated by the life-threatening injuries sustained by Pedro Horrillo in the eighth stage after he crashed while descending a mountain. While the ninth stage <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> showy criterium in celebration of this being the 100th anniversary of the Giro d'Italia, the riders collectively protested the safety conditions of that stage and the ones before it. This meant it would be neutralized, with every rider receiving the same finishing time as the stage winner regardless of when they finished.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, Oslo Sporveier {{presented}} plans {{involving a}} rapid transit circle line in Oslo, connecting the newly built hospital Rikshospitalet {{with the rest}} of the city. A detailed suggestion was presented by Oslo Sporveier in August 1996. In the local newspaper Aftenposten Aften there was a debate on whether there should be a ring line from Berg along the National Road 150 towards Gaustad over Rikshospitalet, or whether the Ullevål Hageby Line should be extended from John Colletts plass to Rikshospitalet, thereby creating a correspondence with the Sognsvann Line at the new station Forskningsparken. In the first plans, Berg <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> station on the new ring line. This plan was discarded since local residents feared noise pollution and destroyed lawns. Even though Berg was not made a station on the Ring Line, noise shields were put up along the Sognsvann Line.|$|E
5|$|The {{contention}} that the scene depicts the festival for Athena is fraught with problems. Later sources indicate {{that a number of}} classes of individual who performed a role in the procession are not present in the frieze, these include: the hoplites, the allies in the Delian league, the skiaphoroi or umbrella bearers, the female hydraiphoroi (only male hydrai bearers are portrayed) thetes, slaves, metics, the panathenaic ship, and some would suggest the kanephoros, although there is evidence that she is accounted for. That what we now see <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> generic image of the religious festival is problematic since no other temple sculpture depicts a contemporary event involving mortals. Locating the scene in mythical or historical time has been the principal difficulty of the line of inquiry. John Boardman has suggested that the cavalry portray the heroization of the marathonomachoi, the hoplites who fell at Marathon in 490, and that, therefore these riders were the Athenians {{who took part in the}} last pre-war Greater Panathenaia. In support, he points out, the number of horsemen, chariot passengers (but not charioteers), grooms, and marshals comes to the same as the number Herodotos gives for the Athenian dead: 192. Equally suggestive of a reference to the Persian War, is the similarity several scholars have noted of the frieze to the Apadana sculpture in Persepolis. This has variously been posited to be democratic Athens counter posing itself to oriental tyranny, or, aristocratic Athens emulating the Imperial East. Further to this zeitgeist argument there is J.J. Politt’s {{contention that}} the frieze embodies a Periclean manifesto, which favours the cultural institutions of agones (or contests, as witnessed by the apobatai), sacrifices, and military training as well as a number of other democratic virtues. More recent scholarship pursuing this vein has made the frieze a site of ideological tension between the elite and the demos with perhaps, only the aristocracy present, and merely veiled reference to the ten tribes.|$|E

25|$|Art {{critics who}} had {{favorable}} {{opinions about the}} painting, such as Gertrude Stein and Christopher Morley, also assumed the painting <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> satire of rural small-town life.
