5|$|At the Canning Dam {{and indeed}} all dams, care {{had to be}} taken to prevent water seepage between the {{foundation}} rock and the structure of the dam. At the Canning in addition to cutting back the foundation to solid unfractured rock, a cut-off trench was sited near the upstream face of the dam, down stream which a rock filled drain containing open jointed pipes <b>was</b> <b>provided</b> <b>to</b> intercept any seepage between the rock face and the concrete of the dam. The inclusion of an internal drainage system was considered innovative at the period. Near vertical tubular 8 in (200mm) cut-off drains were provided at five-foot (1.52 m) intervals along the dam to relieve internal seepage through the concrete.|$|E

On 8 February 1971 the leading ARVN units marched along Route 9 into Southern Laos while the US ground forces and advisers were prohibited from entering Laos. US logistical, aerial, and artillery support <b>was</b> <b>provided</b> <b>to</b> the operation.

5|$|Roads in Saint Elizabeth {{sustained}} substantial damage, with 32 separate roads experiencing severe impacts.

Widespread damage to crops also resulted in an increased price in store costs. The loss to farmers was untimely as it followed a three-month drought that was preceded by damaging hailstorms that ruined crops. Following the storm, search and rescue teams were deployed, mainly in Saint Elizabeth Parish following reports of flooding.|$|E
5|$|The {{figure of}} Joan of Arc {{represents}} both a common {{person and a}} child that was free from society's corruption. Between the editions, however, Southey's understanding of politics and religion began to change, and this {{is reflected in the}} changes of Joan of Arc for the second edition. Joan was originally a character that had a natural understanding of religion that was connected to a Socinian form of Christianity. She, as a child, was ignorant of Church and of theology except what was revealed to her directly. However, this was replaced in the second edition with Joan having a more traditional form of religion that <b>was</b> <b>provided</b> <b>to</b> her during her youth.|$|E

5|$|British {{knowledge}} of thermonuclear weapons {{was based on}} work done at the Los Alamos Laboratory during the war. Two British scientists, Bretscher and Fuchs, had attended the conference on the Super (as it was then called) there in April 1946, and Chadwick had written a secret report on it in May 1946. The Classic Super design was unsuccessful. Fuchs and John von Neumann had produced an ingenious alternative design, for which they filed a patent in May 1946. This was tested in the American Operation Greenhouse George test in May 1951, but was also found to be unworkable. There was also some intelligence about Joe 4 derived from its debris, which <b>was</b> <b>provided</b> <b>to</b> Britain under the 1948 Modus Vivendi. Penney established three megaton bomb projects at Aldermaston. Orange Herald, under Bryan Taylor, a large boosted fission weapon; Green Bamboo an interim thermonuclear design similar to Soviet Layer Cake used in Joe 4 and the American Alarm Clock; and Green Granite, a true thermonuclear design. Orange Herald {{would be the first}} British weapon to incorporate an external neutron initiator.|$|E
5|$|By May1, {{the local}} {{branch of the}} Red Cross {{distributed}} essential supplies to residents in Labutta Township. In coordination with the Disaster Assistance Response Team, the areas in greatest need for aid were identified and requests for tarpaulin were made. Members of the Cabinet of Burma donated 3.7million kyat (US$2,960) in cash and 140bags of rice to victims in the Ayeyarwady Region. On May3, another 1.7million kyat (US$1,360) was donated by social organizations to residents in rural areas outside Yangon. Temporary shelters were set up across Gwa Township. Local donations provided residents in the town with 200,000kyat (US$160) worth of blankets, clothes, and cash. A local newspaper, The New Light of Myanmar, claimed that government officials immediately provided assistance to affected residents across the country. Red Cross operations continued through November30, by which time 3,485families were provided with aid. Additionally, though the agency planned to assist 4,000families with rebuilding their homes, a lack of necessary funds prevented the operation. Instead, a cash donation <b>was</b> <b>provided</b> <b>to</b> the 1,000most affected families.|$|E

5|$|By October 1915 Campania had {{exercised}} {{with the}} Grand Fleet seven times, but had only flown off aircraft {{three times as}} the North Sea was often too rough for her seaplanes to use. Her captain recommended that the flying-off deck be lengthened and given a steeper slope to allow gravity to boost the aircraft's acceleration and the ship was accordingly modified at Cammell Laird between November 1915 and early April 1916. The forward funnel was split into two funnels and the flight deck was extended between them and over the bridge to a length of , so that aircraft from both holds could use the flight deck. A canvas windscreen <b>was</b> <b>provided</b> <b>to</b> allow the aircraft to unfold their wings out of the wind, and a kite balloon {{and all of its}} supporting equipment were added in the aft hold. Campania now carried seven Short Type 184 torpedo bombers and three or four smaller fighters or scouts; a Type 184 made its first takeoff from the flight deck on 3 June 1916, also using a wheeled trolley. This success prompted the Admiralty to order the world's first aircraft designed for carrier operations, the Fairey Campania. The ship received the first of these aircraft in late 1917 where they joined smaller Sopwith 1½ Strutter scouts. At various times Campania also carried the Sopwith Baby and Sopwith Pup.|$|E
5|$|Completion of {{the station}} {{buildings}} was delayed for many years. Designed by the architect Charles Holden, the pre-war plans included a large entrance building {{at the top of}} the hill next to The Woodman public house with a pair of escalators between the entrance and the sub-surface concourse. These were to be enclosed in an inclined structure down the side of the cutting parallel with the surface tracks. Taking inspiration from the local legend, the building would have been topped by a statue of Dick Whittington and his cat. When works were finished in 1957, a single, upwards only, escalator <b>was</b> <b>provided</b> <b>to</b> take passengers from the sub-surface ticket hall up to a simple exit {{at the top of the}} cutting.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{signing the}} Kano Accord, Libya was incensed that the GUNT {{did not include}} any {{of the leaders of}} the Volcan Army and had not {{recognized}} Libyan claims on the Aouzou Strip. Since 13 April there had been some minor Libyan military activity in northern Chad, and support <b>was</b> <b>provided</b> <b>to</b> the secessionist movement in the south. However, a major response came only after 25 June, when the ultimatum of Chad's neighbors for the formation of a new, more inclusive coalition government expired. On 26 June, 2,500 Libyan troops invaded Chad, heading for Faya-Largeau. The Chadian government appealed for French help. The Libyan forces were first stymied by Goukouni's militiamen, and then forced to retreat by French reconnaissance planes and bombers. In the same month, the factions excluded by the GUNT founded a counter-government, the Front for Joint Provisional Action (FACP), in northern Chad with Libyan military support.|$|E
