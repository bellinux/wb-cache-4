25|$|To {{those who}} believe that {{consciousness}} entails something more than behaving in all ways conscious, Dennett's view is seen as eliminativist, since it denies the existence of qualia and the possibility of philosophical zombies. However, Dennett is not denying the existence of the mind or of consciousness, only what he considers a naive view of them. The point of contention is whether Dennett's own definitions are indeed more accurate, whether what we think of <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>speak</b> of perceptions and consciousness can be understood in terms of nothing more than their effect on behaviour.|$|E

2500|$|Very {{little is}} known about Diophantus of Alexandria; he {{probably}} lived in the third century CE, that is, about five hundred years after Euclid. Six out of the thirteen books of Diophantus's Arithmetica survive in the original Greek; four more books survive in an Arabic translation. The Arithmetica is a collection of worked-out problems where the task is invariably to find rational solutions to a system of polynomial equations, usually of the form [...] or [...] Thus, nowadays, we speak of Diophantine equations <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>speak</b> of polynomial equations to which rational or integer solutions must be found.|$|E
2500|$|The {{legacy of}} Zina Diantha Huntington Jacobs Smith Young {{is one of}} obedience, diligence, and service. She {{was a member of}} an elite circle of early Latter Day Saints, sealed to two presidents of the church and a {{remarkable}} leader of Mormon women in Utah. She met with the diametric ideals of the tough, independent frontierswoman and the Victorian ideals of [...] "piety, purity, submissiveness, and domesticity" [...] and was an example to the early Saints in the valley of a faithful Mormon woman.

2500|$|Continuity {{itself is}} a local {{property}} of a function—that is, a function f is continuous, or not, at a particular point, and this can be determined by looking only at {{the values of the}} function in an (arbitrarily small) neighbourhood of that point. [...] <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>speak</b> of a function being continuous on an interval, we mean only that it is continuous at each point of the interval. [...] In contrast, uniform continuity is a global property of f, {{in the sense that the}} standard definition refers to pairs of points rather than individual points. [...] On the other hand, it is possible to give a definition that is local in terms of the natural extension f* (the characteristics of which at nonstandard points are determined by the global properties of f), although it is not possible to give a local definition of uniform continuity for an arbitrary hyperreal-valued function, see below.|$|E

60|$|Conformable also to {{what has}} been said {{concerning}} the essences of the species of mixed modes, that they are the creatures of the understanding rather than the works of nature; conformable, I say, to this, we find that their names lead our thoughts to the mind, and no further. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>speak</b> of JUSTICE, or GRATITUDE, we frame to ourselves no imagination of anything existing, which we would conceive; but our thoughts terminate in the abstract ideas of those virtues, and look not further; as they do <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>speak</b> of a HORSE, or IRON, whose specific ideas we consider not as barely in the mind, but as in things themselves, which afford the original patterns of those ideas. But in mixed modes, at least the most considerable parts of them, which are moral beings, we consider the original patterns as being in the mind, and to those we refer for the distinguishing of particular beings under names. And hence I think it is that these essences of the species of mixed modes are by a more particular name called NOTIONS; as, by a peculiar right, appertaining to the understanding.|$|E
