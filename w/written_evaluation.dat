40|$|With {{the advent}} of English as a global language, the ability to write well in English across diverse {{settings}} and for different audiences has become an imperative in second language education programmes throughout the world. Yet the teaching of second language writing is often hindered by the great {{amount of time and}} skill needed to evaluate repeated drafts of student writing. Online Automated <b>Writing</b> <b>Evaluation</b> programmes have been developed as a way to meet this challenge, and the scoring engines driving such programmes have been analysed in a considerable array of psychometric studies. However, relatively little research has been conducted on how AWE is used in the classroom and the results achieved with such use. In this article, we analyse recent developments in automated <b>writing</b> <b>evaluation,</b> explain the bases on which AWE systems operate, synthesize research with these systems, and propose a multifaceted process/product research programme on the instructional use of AWE.

I Writing: the neglected R The backdrop to the development of Automated <b>Writing</b> <b>Evaluation</b> (AWE; also referred to as Automated Essay Scoring 1) is the changing role and importance of English language writing. Approaches to teaching English arise from the broader social, economic, cultural, and political contexts that shape the needs for using the language (Warschauer, 2000). Thus prior to the second world war, much foreign language instruction in English focused on reading, as this represented a principal use of foreign languages in many countries (Brown, 2001).
