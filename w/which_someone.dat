25|$|It is {{held that}} the cause of {{sickness}} is soul theft, in <b>which</b> <b>someone</b> (perhaps an enemy, whether human or a spirit) has stolen the soul of the sick person. It takes a spiritual healer to retrieve the stolen soul. The person remains alive because people have multiple souls, so stealing the appropriate soul causes illness or a moribund state rather than immediate death. According to another variant among Ammassalik in East Greenland, the joints of the body have their own small souls, the loss of which causes pain.|$|E

Sometimes these descriptions are like a slide show, in <b>which</b> <b>someone</b> shows each of the things described there; examples include the geographic start of Gama's speech to the king of Melinde, certain sculptures of the palaces of Neptune and the Samorim, the speech of Paulo da Gama to the Catual, and the Machine of the World (Máquina do Mundo).|$|E

25|$|In Trauma and Recovery, Herman {{expresses the}} {{additional}} concern that patients {{who suffer from}} C-PTSD frequently risk being misunderstood as inherently 'dependent', 'masochistic', or 'self-defeating', comparing this attitude to the historical misdiagnosis of female hysteria. However, those who develop C-PTSD do so {{as a result of the}} intensity of the trauma bond – in <b>which</b> <b>someone</b> becomes tightly biolo-chemically bound to someone who abuses them (also known as Stockholm Syndrome – seen in cases of kidnapping in which a person falls in love with their captors) and the responses they learned to survive, navigate and deal with the abuse they suffered then become automatic responses, imbedded in their personality over the years of trauma – a normal reaction to an abnormal situation.|$|E

500|$|Some {{changes were}} made to the initial plot of Virtue's Last Reward. During one scene, Dio {{handcuffs}} Clover and Tenmyouji to a sink, which prevents them from participation in the Nonary Game (the punishment for not participating is death). Originally, Dio was meant to [...] "do something even more messed up" [...] to Clover, but the president of Chunsoft opposed this scene for [...] "ethical reasons", after which it was changed. While the game ends in the year 2029 with humanity dying out and Sigma aspiring to change the future, Uchikoshi later felt this ending alone was inappropriate following the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. He added an extended, non-canonical ending featuring Kyle to lighten the mood. Uchikoshi also considered including several scientific and philosophical concepts that eventually were left out. These scrapped ideas included the Monty Hall problem, a brain teaser based on probability; and the Capgras delusion, a mental disorder in <b>which</b> <b>someone</b> believes that a person they know has been replaced with an identical-looking impostor.|$|E
500|$|The story {{crosses the}} paths of {{characters}} from various social and ethnic groups in Los Angeles. [...] Forty of the ensemble cast have significant speaking roles, but none takes {{the part of a}} main protagonist. [...] The story takes place in 1989, {{against the backdrop of the}} city's racial tensions of the era and the US invasion of Panama. [...] At the nominal center is a punk band called Love and Rockets, which shares its name with the English band; the punk band complains stole the name from them (the real-life band formed in 1985 and took its name from the Hernandez's comic book). [...] The band is slated to appear at a party at the bass player's upper-class mother's home, but the performance never takes place in the story. [...] Rather, the story quickly transitions from character to character, revealing details of each one's personality traits and ethnic, class, sexual, and subcultural backgrounds. [...] The story builds in complexity to a chaotic alcohol- and drug-fueled party in <b>which</b> <b>someone</b> almost gets killed; the turbulant narrative then calms and slows into a sequence of wordless panels that pan out into the cosmos.|$|E
500|$|The 1920s in the United States was {{a period}} marked by {{considerable}} anxiety and discussion over the crossing of racial boundaries, the so-called [...] "color line" [...] between blacks and whites. This anxiety was exacerbated by the Great Migration, in which {{hundreds of thousands of}} blacks left the rural south for northern and midwestern cities, where, together with new waves of immigrants, they changed the social makeup. The practice of persons [...] "crossing the color line"—attempting to claim recognition in another racial group than the one they were believed to belong to—was known as [...] "passing". As many African Americans had European ancestry in varying proportions, some appeared visibly European. The legacy of slavery, with its creation of a racial caste, and the imposition in the early 20th century of the so-called one-drop rule (by <b>which</b> <b>someone</b> with even one ancestor of sub-Saharan-African origin was considered black) led to a hardening of racial lines that had historically been more fluid; at any time, the concept of race was [...] "historically contingent." [...] Although the exact numbers of people who passed is, for obvious reasons, not known, many estimates were made at the time. The sociologist Charles S. Johnson (1893–1956) calculated that 355,000 blacks had passed between 1900 and 1920.|$|E
