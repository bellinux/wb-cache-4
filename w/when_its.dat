5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance southwest of Manzanillo, Colima became a tropical depression on September 12 <b>when</b> <b>its</b> convection became persistent around a newly formed center of circulation.

5|$|Another {{development}} was the Dreyer Fire-control Table that combined {{the functions of}} the Dumaresq and the range clock in the transmission stations. Hercules was probably fitted with a prototype table <b>when</b> <b>its</b> inventor, Commander Frederic Dreyer, was assigned to the ship at the end of 1911. The ship retained that instrument at least until February 1916, although it had been replaced by a Mark I table by 1918. Colossus received her Mark I table by early 1916.|$|E
