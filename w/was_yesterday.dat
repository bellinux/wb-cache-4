2500|$|British Prime Minister Asquith {{wrote to}} Stanley: [...] "The European {{situation}} {{is at least}} one degree worse than it <b>was</b> <b>yesterday,</b> and has not been improved by a rather shameless attempt on the part of Germany to buy our neutrality during the war by promises that she will not annex French territory (except colonies) or Holland or Belgium. There is something very crude & childlike about German diplomacy. Meanwhile the French are beginning to press in the opposite sense, as the Russians have been doing for some time. The City, wh. is in a terrible state of depression and paralysis, is the time being all against English intervention." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{terms of}} global {{interpretation}} of the council, Luciani wrote: [...] "The physiognomy {{and structure of the}} Catholic Church have been determined once and for all by the Lord and cannot be touched. If anything, superstructures can. Things that have not been determined by Christ, but were introduced by popes or councils or the faithful, can be changed, or eliminated today or tomorrow. Yesterday they might have introduced a certain number of dioceses, a certain way to lead missions, to educate priests, they might have chosen to follow certain cultural trends. Well, this can be changed and one can say [...] "the Church that comes out of the Council is still the same as it <b>was</b> <b>yesterday,</b> but renewed". No one can ever say [...] "We have a new Church, different from what it was".|$|E

[...] Lennon made reference to [...] "Yesterday" [...] in his song [...] "How Do You Sleep?" [...] on his 1971 album Imagine. The song appears to attack McCartney with the line [...] "The only thing you done <b>was</b> <b>yesterday,</b> but since you've gone you're just another day", a reference to McCartney's recent hit [...] "Another Day".

2500|$|In 1968, Boesch {{was sent}} on a combat {{deployment}} to the Vietnam War, as a platoon chief based in Mỹ Tho in the Mekong Delta. [...] The general combat mission of SEALs in Vietnam {{was to do}} intelligence gathering and to conduct raids and ambushes and make prisoner grabs. [...] In Boesch's own 1995 retelling, he did all those things on that tour. [...] In the 2010 Vietnam-era memoir SEAL Warrior: The Only Easy Day <b>Was</b> <b>Yesterday,</b> Thomas Keith describes Boesch leading a platoon in nighttime ambush raids against the Viet Cong during the war, operating in the delta and using LCM-8 [...] "Mike boats" [...] for access. [...] Boesch earned the Bronze Star for heroic action during more than 45 combat operations. [...] Another primary mission for SEALs during the conflict was to train South Vietnamese special forces. When Boesch deployed to Vietnam again, in 1970, he later related that {{this time he was}} sent to Cam Ranh Bay, where he conducted training for the Liên Đoàn Người Nhái, the South Vietnamese equivalent of the UDT, as part of the Vietnamization strategy. [...] Boesch later assessed that these allied forces were capable, but overly dependent upon the U.S., and that [...] "Vietnamization was an idea that came too late to do enough good." ...|$|E
