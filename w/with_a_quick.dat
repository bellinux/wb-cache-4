5|$|On March 3, 2007, Hughes {{returned}} to the Octagon for , defeating Chris Lytle by unanimous decision, winning 30–27 on all three judges' scorecards. Hughes secured an armbar {{at the end of}} round one, but Lytle was saved by the bell. Hughes opened the second round <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> takedown, moving up to side-control and then landed an elbow that cut Lytle. Finally, Hughes mounted his opponent, but Lytle swept and was able to reverse that position. In the third round, Hughes unsuccessfully tried an armbar again before the horn sounded.|$|E
5|$|With 7.f4 White stakes {{out even}} more {{space in the}} centre and threatens to overrun Black's {{position}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> e4-e5. After 7...Bg7 White can transpose to the main line of the Four Pawns Attack in the King's Indian Defence with 8.Nf3 0-0 9.Be2. A rarer option is 8.e5, the Mikenas Attack, against which Black can equalize with either 8...Nfd7 or the rarer 8...dxe5 9.fxe5 Nfd7.|$|E
5|$|An ambush predator, the Pacific {{angelshark}} conceals {{itself on}} the sea floor and waits for approaching prey, primarily bony fishes and squid. Prey are targeted visually and, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> upward thrust of the head, snatched in protrusible jaws. Individual sharks actively choose ideal ambush sites, where they stay for several days {{before moving on to}} a new one. This species is more active at night than during the day, when it stays buried in sediment and seldom moves. Reproduction is ovoviviparous, with the embryos hatching inside the mother's uterus and being sustained by a yolk sac until birth. Females give birth to an average of six young every spring.|$|E

5|$|In the second, the Soviets started <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> goal by Shadrin after 21 seconds. The {{last ten}} minutes saw two goals from the Soviets: Yakushev scoring his seventh {{of the series}} {{followed}} by Vasiliev on the power play to put the Soviets ahead 5–3 after two periods. White had countered for Canada midway through the period. It was one of few moments for Canada to cheer as the Soviets played an excellent period. The other was a goal-saving play by Esposito who stopped a shot by Yury Blinov who had faked goaltender Dryden out of position and had an empty net to shoot at. Blinov was denied by Esposito who stopped the puck with his stick on the goal line. Blinov and the crowd had prematurely celebrated the apparent goal, and Blinov {{shook his head in}} disbelief.|$|E
5|$|Tadeusz Kościuszko {{proposed}} a plan where the entire Polish army would be concentrated and would engage {{one of the}} Russian armies, in order to assure numerical parity and to boost the morale of mostly inexperienced Polish forces <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> victory; this plan was however rejected by Prince Poniatowski. (Only a few months ago, however, both commanders had the opposite idea – Poniatowski wanted the troops concentrated, and Kościuszko, dispersed). Poniatowski also planned to avoid serious engagements {{in the first phase}} of the war, hoping to receive the expected Prussian reinforcements of 30,000 which would bring parity to the two sides.|$|E
5|$|The jaguar is a stalk-and-ambush {{rather than}} a chase predator. The cat will walk slowly down forest paths, {{listening}} for and stalking prey before rushing or ambushing. The jaguar attacks from cover and usually from a target's blind spot <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> pounce; the species' ambushing abilities are considered nearly peerless in the animal kingdom by both indigenous people and field researchers, and are probably a product of its role as an apex predator in several different environments. The ambush may include leaping into water after prey, as a jaguar is quite capable of carrying a large kill while swimming; its strength is such that carcasses {{as large as a}} heifer can be hauled up a tree to avoid flood levels.|$|E

5|$|Florida State {{received}} the post-score kickoff, then went three-and-out. Virginia Tech recovered the kick at its 35-yard line, {{and began a}} drive that needed only three plays to score a touchdown. The key effort was a 51-yard sprint by running back Darren Evans, which advanced {{the ball to the}} Florida State 9-yard line. The score and extra point pushed Tech's lead to 14–3 with 4:37 remaining. Florida State responded <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> touchdown drive of its own. From its 32-yard line, the Seminoles needed only six plays, three of them passes from E. J. Manuel, to reach the end zone. The score with 1:52 remaining trimmed Tech's lead to 14–10 at the 1:52 mark. As the quarter came to an end, Virginia Tech {{received the}} post-score kickoff and advanced the ball to its 22-yard line before the final seconds ticked off the clock and the first quarter ended with Tech leading 14–10.|$|E
5|$|Now {{beginning}} to compose independently, Rachmaninoff's next project {{was a group}} he titled Three Nocturnes, and is regarded as his first serious attempt at writing for the piano. The first nocturne, in F-sharp minor, was written 14-21 November 1887, and has three parts: a beginning and an end in andante cantabile and a central section in allegro. The slower andantes are gentle sections, influenced by Pyotr Tchaikovsky, while the allegro is unnatural and stiff and unusually fast for a nocturne. The second piece, in F major, followed on 22-25 November, also contains a slower portion coupled <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> section. No. 3, in C minor, {{took more than a}} month to compose, dated from 3 December 1886 to 12 January 1887. With a chordal texture spread over the entire keyboard, it is reminiscent of the music of Robert Schumann. The nocturnes were published posthumously in Moscow in 1949, but were not assigned an opus number.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the An-70 {{can be traced back}} to the mid-1970s, when Antonov Design Bureau began {{preliminary}} design work on a successor for the An-12 twin-engine turboprop aircraft. The Soviet Armed Forces, by the 1980s, were looking for a replacement for the An-12 and a complement to the Ilyushin Il-76 four-engine jet transporter; in 1987, the Ministry of Defence, with a new emphasis on air mobility, specified an aircraft <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> loading time, the ability to operate from short unprepared airfields, could carry up to 300 troops, and have good operating economy. The initial contract for work on the An-70 was concluded in May 1989; Antonov began advanced design work on the new aircraft during the same year. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, in June 1993, the Russian and Ukrainian governments agreed to jointly develop the An-70, with 80percent of the funding expected to come from Russia. The following year, twenty companies and organisations from the former Soviet Union agreed to jointly develop, market and support the aircraft.|$|E

5|$|In February 1945, as the Australians began {{advancing}} {{into the}} thick, hilly interior, {{the utility of}} the machine guns decreased. At the behest of Brigadier Roy King, commander of the 16th Brigade, the 2/3rd Machine Gun Battalion was hastily converted into a standard infantry battalion, which was achieved <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> issue of rifles, sub-machine guns and mortars. From then {{until the end of the}} war, the battalion took part in the ground advance through Wewak and beyond, fighting a series of small scale patrol actions, initially advancing through Arohemi and Muguluwela, and finally the town of But, while 'B' Company was assigned to Farida Force and carried out an amphibious landing around Dove Bay, in early May. The battalion later moved into the Mandi and Brandi areas where they were tasked with re-invigorating the Australian operations in the area, as Japanese resistance around the plantations increased. By late July, the majority of the battalion moved to Wewak Point, while two companies remained in the vicinity of Mandi–Bandi; operations in the area had killed 59 Japanese, for the loss of four men from 2/3rd killed in action and eight wounded. The battalion's final action of the war came on 7 August when a patrol killed four Japanese. A week later, the Japanese surrender was announced, bringing combat operations officially to an end. The battalion's final campaign of the war cost them 94 battle casualties.|$|E
5|$|Penn State got {{the ball}} to start the game, and drove down the field with {{relative}} ease (facing only one third down) prior to stalling at their 26-yard line and turning the ball over on downs. After an Indiana three and out, Penn State ran another drive {{at the end of}} which they turned over on downs. Each team ran one more drive before Indiana attained first downs on three consecutive plays, ultimately culminating their possession with a five-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Nate Sudfeld to Isaiah Roundtree, making the score 7–0 at the end of the first quarter. Penn State responded on their second drive of the second quarter via a 46-yard pass from Hackenberg to Robinson to tie the game. Later, Mitch Ewald kicked a short field goal to re-take the lead. Penn State had a chance to tie the game again when kicker Sam Ficken attempted a 42-yard field goal, but Indiana blocked the kick, and with their ensuing momentum drove down the field at the end of the half, ultimately ending with Ewald hitting a field goal as time expired. After halftime, Indiana ran a quick drive on which they punted before Penn State ran a 13-play, 80-yard drive that concluded with Robinson catching his second touchdown of the game, a 26-yard pass from Hackenberg. Indiana responded <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> score; they converted a two-point conversion to take a 21–14 lead. Late in the third quarter, Hackenberg threw a fade pattern to Robinson in the corner of the end zone, which Robinson corralled, but he landed on his back out of bounds, and came up either with the wind knocked out, or some sort of back injury. Penn State settled for a field goal, and at the end of three, Indiana led 21–17. The fourth quarter entrenched the Hoosiers' lead, as they totaled 23 points to only 7 for Penn State, winning the game 44–24, their final score coming on a safety.|$|E
