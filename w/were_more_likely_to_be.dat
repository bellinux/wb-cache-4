Artefact remains found at La Trinidad de Nosotros <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> waste products from artefact manufacture while at Motul de San José they <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> artefacts {{at the end of}} their usable life. Aquatic animal products arriving at Motul de San José were far more likely to be consumed by the elite than by commoners, whether used as food or to craft artefacts.|$|E
5|$|Large fruitings of {{the fungus}} are often {{associated}} with damage to the host tree, such as that which occurs with burning. A field study conducted in Norway demonstrated that fruit bodies <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> found in areas that were heavily burned, compared to locations with light to moderate burning where the trees remained viable, or in clearcut areas. Fruiting was much denser in spruce forests—with up to 700–1000 fruitbodies per square meter—than in pine forests, where fruitbodies were sporadic. Fruitbodies grew by the millions in the year following the Yellowstone fires of 1988.|$|E

It was also credited with improving school attendance, especially among girls, who <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> allowed to go to school if a meal was being provided. In August 2000, President Clinton presented McGovern with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, in recognition of McGovern's service in the effort to eradicate world hunger. McGovern's book The Third Freedom: Ending Hunger In Our Time was published in January 2001; with its title making reference to Roosevelt's Four Freedoms speech, it proposed a plan whereby chronic world hunger could be eliminated within thirty years. In January 2001, McGovern was asked to stay on at the UN post for a while by the incoming George W. Bush administration. His stint then concluded with a termination of mission on September 28, 2001.|$|E

5|$|The new senator {{took his}} seat when Congress convened in December 1857 (the term of his predecessor, James C. Jones, had expired in March). He came to Washington as usual without {{his wife and}} family; Eliza would visit Washington only once during Johnson's first time as senator, in 1860. Johnson {{immediately}} set about introducing the Homestead Bill in the Senate, but as most senators who supported it were Northern (many associated with the newly founded Republican Party), the matter became caught up in suspicions over the slavery issue. Southern senators felt that those who {{took advantage of the}} provisions of the Homestead Bill <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Northern non-slaveholders. The issue of slavery had been complicated by the Supreme Court's ruling earlier in the year in Dred Scott v. Sandford that slavery could not be prohibited in the territories. Johnson, a slaveholding senator from a Southern state, made a major speech in the Senate the following May in an attempt to convince his colleagues that the Homestead Bill and slavery were not incompatible. Nevertheless, Southern opposition was key to defeating the legislation, 30–22. In 1859, it failed on a procedural vote when Vice President Breckinridge broke a tie against the bill, and in 1860, a watered-down version passed both houses, only to be vetoed by Buchanan at the urging of Southerners. Johnson continued his opposition to spending, chairing a committee to control it.|$|E

40|$|Copyright © 2015 UCLA Law Review-All Rights Reserved. Of the large, public {{companies}} {{that seek to}} remain in business through bankruptcy reorganization, only 70 percent succeed. The assets of the other 30 percent are absorbed into other businesses. Success is important both because it is efficient and because it preserves jobs, communities, supplier and customer relationships, and tax revenues. This Article reports {{the findings of the}} first comprehensive study of the variables that determine whether a business will succeed or fail. Eleven conditions best predict companies' survival prospects. First, a company that even hints in the press release announcing its bankruptcy that it intends to sell its business is highly <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> fail. Second, reorganizations assigned to <b>more</b> experienced judges <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> succeed. Third, companies headquartered in isolated geographical areas <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> fail. Fourth, companies that report greater shareholder equity <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> fail. Fifth, companies with routinely appointed creditors' committees <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> fail. Sixth, companies with debtor-in-possession (DIP) loans <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> succeed. Seventh, companies that prepackage or prenegotiate their plans <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> succeed. Eighth, companies that file in periods of low interest rates <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> succeed. Ninth, larger companies <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> succeed. Tenth, manufacturers <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> succeed. Eleventh, companies with positive pre-filing operating income <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> succeed. System participants may be able to improve survival rates by shifting cases to more experienced judges and perhaps also by paying greater attention to the decisions to appoint creditors' committees, to prenegotiate plans, to obtain DIP loans, and to publicly seek alliances...|$|R
