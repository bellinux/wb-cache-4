5|$|A {{few days}} later, {{in the wake}} of the scandal, Waugh was widely jeered by an Australian crowd when he <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> bat on the first day of the Test. In what he {{described}} as the toughest day of his career, Waugh gave an unconvincing and hesitant performance. Waugh managed only seven runs in 36 minutes before being removed by Peter Such, caught and bowled. The cricket writer Peter Roebuck opined that it was the worst home crowd reception for an Australian player that he could remember. Warne was injured at the time and did not play, so he did not have to face the hostile crowd.|$|E
5|$|The England openers Cyril Washbrook and Len Hutton {{were given}} a loud {{reception}} as they <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> bat, particularly the Yorkshire local Hutton. They {{had to face the}} Australian opening pair of Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller without the aid of sightscreen. It was the first time some of the Australians had played in a first-class match without a sightscreen, and those cricketers would later have to bat without its assistance. It was believed the Yorkshire administrators were reluctant to install a sightscreen as it would have taken up space and lowered the capacity of the ground, and thus the gate takings.|$|E
5|$|The opening bout {{was for the}} TNA X Division Championship {{between the}} {{champion}} Petey Williams and the challenger Consequences Creed. The duration of the match was 12 minutes and 30 seconds. Williams was accompanied to the ring by Rhaka Khan, who interfered in the contest trying to aid Williams to no avail. Near {{the end of the}} match, Sheik Abdul Bashir <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the ring and bashed Creed across the back with a steel chair, which allowed Williams to force Creed's head into the mat with his signature Canadian Destroyer maneuver. Williams followed with the pin to win the match and retain the TNA X Division Championship. After the bout, Bashir continued to attack Creed.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{came out}} to bat halfway through the middle session on the second day, after England had ended on 363. Having dropped Brown, Barnes's injury left Australia with only one {{specialist}} opener, Morris. Johnson—a bowler—was deployed as Australia's makeshift second opener and fell for one. On the third morning, Barnes {{came out to}} bat upon Keith Miller's dismissal at 4/135, {{even though he had}} collapsed from the aftereffects of his injury while practising in the nets. Barnes had refused to stay in hospital and returned to the ground despite his ribs being discoloured from the bruising. Bradman was not aware of Barnes's collapse in the nets, but had told all rounder Sam Loxton to bat before Barnes to give the bruised opener more rest. Loxton told Barnes of Bradman's wishes, but when Miller was dismissed, Barnes defied team orders and <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> bat, shaking Pollard's hand at the start of his innings.|$|E
5|$|Financial {{difficulties}} and instability at board level led to six managerial changes in seven years. Saunders resigned after FA Cup defeat to non-league Altrincham, John Bond {{seemed out of}} touch, and in April 1989, once relegation to the Third Division {{for the first time}} in the club's history was confirmed, the club's new owners replaced Garry Pendrey with Dave Mackay. Within 18 months, with relegation to the Fourth Division a possibility, Mackay resigned. Lou Macari came in, revitalised the side, won the Associate Members' Cup at Wembley, and three weeks later <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> join Stoke City. Terry Cooper won promotion back to the second tier and kept the team going during four months of administration before he quit, fearing new owner David Sullivan would want to bring in his own man.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, Australia batted with {{apparent}} ease, and Morris and Barnes passed England's first innings total by themselves. The score {{had reached}} 117 before Barnes fell to Hollies for 61, ending a partnership {{that had taken}} only 126 minutes. This brought Bradman to the crease late on the first day. As Bradman had announced that the tour was his last at international level, the innings {{would be his last}} at Test level if Australia batted only once. The crowd gave him a standing ovation as he <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> bat. Yardley led his team in giving Bradman three cheers. With 6996 Test career runs, he only needed four runs to average 100 in Test cricket, but Hollies bowled him second ball for a duck with a googly. Hassett came in at 117/2 and Australia closed at 153/2. Morris was unbeaten on 77.|$|E

5|$|In {{the final}} Test at The Oval, Bradman <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> bat in Australia's first innings. He {{received}} {{a standing ovation}} from the crowd and three cheers from the opposition. His Test batting average stood at 101.39. Facing the wrist-spin of Eric Hollies, Bradman pushed forward to the second ball that he faced, was deceived by a googly, and bowled between bat and pad for a duck. An England batting collapse resulted in an innings defeat, denying Bradman the opportunity to bat again and so his career average finished at 99.94; if he had scored just four runs in his last innings, {{it would have been}} 100. A story developed over the years that claimed Bradman missed the ball because of tears in his eyes, a claim Bradman denied {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1925, Waugh's outlook briefly improved, with the {{prospect}} of a job in Pisa, Italy, as secretary to the Scottish writer Charles Kenneth Scott Moncrieff, who was engaged on the English translations of Marcel Proust's works. Believing that the job was his, Waugh resigned his position at Arnold House. He had meantime sent the early chapters of his novel to Acton for assessment and criticism. Acton's reply was so coolly dismissive that Waugh immediately burnt his manuscript; shortly afterwards, before he left North Wales, he learned that the Moncrieff job had fallen through. The twin blows were sufficient for him to consider suicide. He records that he went down to a nearby beach and, leaving a note with his clothes, <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> sea. An attack by jellyfish changed his mind, and he returned quickly to the shore.|$|E
5|$|At first, Harvey {{struggled}} in the English conditions, failing to pass 25 {{in his first}} six innings. His most notable contribution {{in the early stages}} of the campaign was against Yorkshire in Bradford, on a damp pitch that suited slower bowling. The match saw 324 runs fall for 36 wickets. No sooner had Harvey <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> bat, stand-in captain Lindsay Hassett was caught to leave Australia at 5/20 in pursuit of 60. To make matters worse, Sam Loxton was injured and could not bat, so Australia were effectively six wickets down and faced its first loss to an English county since 1912. Harvey had scored a solitary run when he hit a ball to Len Hutton at short leg, who dived forwards and grabbed it with both hands before dropping it. Harvey then swept the next ball for a boundary. Colin McCool was out at 6/31 before Harvey and wicket-keeper Don Tallon steadied Australia. Harvey was reprieved on 12; he charged the bowling but the wicketkeeper fumbled the stumping opportunity. Harvey then hit the winning runs with a six over the sightscreen, ending unbeaten on 18 not out. It was the closest Australia had come to defeat for the whole tour.|$|E

5|$|In contrast, Australia batted with {{apparent}} ease, and Morris and Barnes passed England's first innings total by themselves. The score {{had reached}} 117 before Barnes was caught behind from Hollies for 61. The opening stand had been compiled in only 126 minutes. This brought Bradman to the crease shortly before 6 pm {{late on the}} first day. As Bradman had announced that the tour was his last at international level, the innings {{would be his last}} at Test level if Australia batted only once. The crowd gave him a standing ovation as he <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> bat. Yardley led the Englishmen in giving his Australian counterpart three cheers. With 6996 Test career runs, he only needed four runs to average 100 in Test cricket, but Hollies bowled him second ball for a duck with a googly that went between bat and pad. Hassett came in at 117/2 and together with Morris saw Australia to the close at 153/2. Morris was unbeaten on 77, having hit two hook shots from Hollies for four.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, Australia batted with ease, as the {{overcast}} skies {{cleared and}} sun came out. The debutant Allan Watkins opened the bowling, delivering four overs for 19 runs before the after-effects of a Lindwall {{blow to the}} shoulder became too much. The openers passed England's first innings total with ease {{in less than an}} hour, and Australia reached 100 at 17:30, with Barnes on 52 and Morris on 47. The tourists reached 117 before Barnes fell to Eric Hollies for 61, ending an opening stand that had been compiled in only 126 minutes. This brought Bradman to the crease late on the first day. As the Australian captain had already announced his retirement {{after the end of the}} series, the innings would be his last in Test cricket if Australia batted only once. The crowd gave him a standing ovation as he <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the wicket. Yardley led the Englishmen in giving Bradman three cheers, before shaking his hand. The Australian captain needed only four runs for a Test average of 100, but was bowled by Hollies for a second ball duck with a googly that went between bat and pad. Bradman received another large round of applause as he left the arena.|$|E
5|$|Making his Test {{debut at}} the Melbourne Cricket Ground, Craig became, {{at the age}} of 17years and 239days, the {{youngest}} ever Australian to play Test cricket. Australia batted first and Craig received a standing ovation from the 47,000-strong crowd as he <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> bat amid high expectations from the public. As South African captain Jack Cheetham stopped proceedings to set his field, the crowd jeered. Australia were comfortably positioned at 3/269 with Craig's partner Neil Harvey {{on his way to a}} double century. Craig cover drove his third ball, bowled by Percy Mansell, for four and quickly moved to 20. In an innings marked by leg glances and fine cuts, Craig progressed to 53 before the new ball was taken. He hit a ball into the covers and was caught, ending the 148-run partnership with Harvey and silencing the crowd. Australia collapsed and ended at 520 but still took a first innings lead of 85 runs. Craig top-scored in the second innings with 47, giving him exactly 100runs for the match as Australia collapsed to be all out for 209 and conceded defeat by six wickets. Given Bradman's Test average of 99.94, Craig's match aggregate prompted further press discussions of Bradmanesque similarities. However, his debut ended on a sour note as South Africa scored 4/297 to win by six wickets and level the series 2–2.|$|E

5|$|The cannonade started {{fires in}} the main {{fortress}} and rapidly disabled Russian guns. Once Russian fire started to decrease, the gunboats moved into position behind the fortresses and began to bombard them as well. In {{the course of the}} morning, the three French vessels fired some 3,000 shells into the fort, and by 12:00, it had been neutralized by the combined firepower of the Anglo-French fleet. A single Russian hoisted a white flag above the fort to indicate their surrender, and Kokhanovitch <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> speak with the French ground commander. According to historian James Grant, around 1,100 Russians of the 1,500-man garrison survived the battle and were allowed to leave without their weapons. Herbert Wilson puts the Russian casualties much lower, at 45 dead and 130 wounded. For the French and British, the only men killed were the two aboard Dévastation, with a further 25 wounded, all of whom were aboard the floating batteries. In the course of the battle, Dévastation was hit 75 times, while Lave received 66 hits and Tonnante was hit around the same number of times. None of the ships emerged from the battle with more than minor dents in their armour plate.|$|E
5|$|Harvey {{made his}} debut on English {{soil in the}} second tour match against Leicestershire. Batting at No. 5, he came in at 3/316 and made 12, {{struggling}} against the local spinners, as Australia collapsed to end on 448 before winning by an innings. Harvey {{played a key role}} in Australia's victory in the next match against Yorkshire in Bradford, on a damp pitch that suited slower bowling. Harvey took two catches in the home side's first innings of 71. He made seven in the first innings as Australia replied with 101. After the hosts were bowled out for 89 in their second innings, Australia collapsed to 4/20 in pursuit of 60 for victory. No sooner had Harvey <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> bat at No. 6, stand-in captain Lindsay Hassett—Bradman rested himself for the match—top-edged a pull shot and was caught to leave Australia at 5/20. To make matters worse, Sam Loxton was injured and could not bat, so Australia were effectively six wickets down and faced their first loss to an English county since 1912. Harvey had scored a solitary run when he hit a ball to Len Hutton at short leg, who dived forwards and grabbed it with both hands before dropping it. Harvey then swept the next ball for a boundary. Colin McCool was out at 6/31 before Harvey and wicket-keeper Don Tallon steadied Australia. Harvey was reprieved on 12; he took several steps down the pitch to the bowling of Frank Smailes and missed, but the wicketkeeper fumbled the stumping opportunity. Harvey then hit the winning runs by lifting Smailes for a six over the sightscreen, ending unbeaten on 18 not out.|$|E

25|$|Australia's brief second innings was paradoxically {{the time}} that England {{delivered}} {{some of the finest}} bowling of the series. Langer was given a guard of honour by the English team as he <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> his final innings, but he was then clearly tested by a series of superb rising deliveries from Harmison. Regardless, the match outcome was inevitable, and it was Hayden who lofted a six, followed by a single, to conclude the innings, the match and the series 5–0 whitewash, the first since 1920/21.|$|E
25|$|The final Test of {{the series}} was the biggest {{disaster}} of all for England. They lost by an innings and 149 runs. Batting first, England were shot out for 52, of which Hutton made 30. Lindwall took 6/20. The Australian openers put on 117, and the total eventually reached 389 (Morris 196). In their second effort England managed only 188. (Johnston 4/40). It was known {{that this would be}} Bradman's final Test, and the crowd gave him an ovation when he <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> bat. He only needed four runs to average 100 in Test cricket, but Eric Hollies bowled him second ball for a duck.|$|E
