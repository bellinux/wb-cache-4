5|$|Due to {{high risk}} of predation, {{dolphins}} often avoid regions inhabited by tiger sharks. Injured or ailing whales may also be attacked and eaten. A group was documented killing an ailing humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) in 2006 near Hawaii. A scavenger, the tiger shark <b>will</b> <b>feed</b> on dead whales, and have been documented doing so alongside great whites.|$|E
5|$|The curve-billed thrasher is an omnivore. Its diet {{includes}} invertebrates such as beetles, moths, butterflies, arachnids, and snails. It also eats vegetable matter, {{and fruits}} from cacti, prickly pear, hackberries, and anacua, among other plants. The curve-billed {{has also been}} spotted eating dog food, and <b>will</b> <b>feed</b> it to their chicks.|$|E
5|$|Black-backed and side-striped jackals, and African golden wolves <b>will</b> <b>feed</b> {{alongside}} hyenas, {{though they}} will be chased if they approach too closely. Spotted hyenas will sometimes follow jackals and wolves during the gazelle fawning season, as jackals and wolves are effective at tracking and catching young animals. Hyenas do not take to eating wolf flesh readily; four hyenas were reported to take half an hour in eating a golden wolf. Overall, the two animals typically ignore each other {{when there is no}} food or young at stake.|$|E
40|$|Different genes {{affect the}} growth rate of pigs on {{different}} levels of feeding. Selection for growth rate on restricted <b>feeding</b> <b>will</b> emphasise food conversion efficiency genes but selection on ad libitum <b>feeding</b> <b>will</b> emphasise appetite genes. This means that pigs selected for growth rate on restricted <b>feeding</b> <b>will</b> not all be the same pigs as those selected for growth rate on ad libitum feeding...|$|R
5000|$|Calibers for {{the rifle}} include [...]22 Short, [...]22 Long, [...]22 Long Rifle, [...]22 Winchester Rimfire. The Model 1890 <b>will</b> only <b>feed</b> the round {{specific}} to that gun (e.g. a Model 1890 stamped [...] ".22 Short" [...] on the barrel <b>will</b> not <b>feed</b> [...]22 Long, [...]22 Long Rifle, or [...]22 WRF; despite there being other 1890s chambered in those calibers). The [...]22 Long Rifle version was added in 1919.|$|R
50|$|The larva, as {{the name}} suggests, feeds on currant, but <b>will</b> also <b>feed</b> on hop. The species overwinters as a pupa.|$|R
5|$|Foraging workers often visit Pisonia {{flowers and}} <b>will</b> <b>feed</b> on the nectar. Other flowers they will visit include Canavalia, Commicarpus, Ipomoea, Melanthera, Plumbago and Scaevola. Ochetellus flavipes {{regularly}} attends the mealybug Prorsococcus acanthodus and protects it by building shelters. They also attend {{a number of}} butterfly larvae, including Anthene lycaenoides (Pale Ciliate Blue), Ogyris amaryllis (Satin Azure), Ogyris olane (Olane Azure) and Ogyris oroetes (Silky Azure).|$|E
5|$|Forest cobras <b>will</b> <b>feed</b> on a {{wide variety}} of prey, {{including}} amphibians, fish, other snakes, monitor lizards and other lizards, bird eggs, rodents, and other small mammals. It has been recorded as taking mudskippers, and in west Africa, one specimen had eaten a Gifford's giant shrew, an insectivore with a smell so noxious, most other snakes would not touch it.|$|E
5|$|Aquatic midges (Chironomidae) {{provide the}} highest {{proportion}} of the fly life of the lake. The trout (Salmonidae) <b>will</b> <b>feed</b> at the surface on these and water boatmen (Corixidae), and below the surface on the caddisfly (Trichoptera) larvae and pupae; they will also take the adult caddisflies when they emerge. Other aquatic fauna including daphnia and snails are {{also found in the}} lake. Large populations of dragonflies, including migrant hawker (Aeshna mixta) and significant numbers of ruddy darter (Sympetrum sanguineum), occur at the lake. Eleven species of wainscot moth make their home in the reed beds, including the nationally local brown-veined wainscot (Archanara dissoluta), twin-spotted wainscot (Archanara geminipuncta) and silky wainscot (Chilodes maritimus).|$|E
50|$|The larvae are {{associated}} with ants and <b>will</b> not <b>feed</b> in captivity. They are small, regularly formed, dark sepia and hairy.|$|R

50|$|It infests flour, bran, oats, {{and other}} grains, {{as well as}} dried fruits. Caterpillars are cannibalistic and <b>will</b> even <b>feed</b> on their siblings.|$|R
5|$|Because adult great spotted kiwis {{are large}} and powerful, {{they are able to}} fend off most predators that attack them, such as stoats, ferrets, weasels, pigs, brush possums and cats, all of which are {{invasive}} species in New Zealand. However, dogs are able to kill even adults. Stoats, ferrets, possums, cats and dogs <b>will</b> <b>feed</b> on the eggs and chicks, meaning most chicks die within their first five months of life. Before the arrival of mammalian predators, the great spotted kiwi's natural predators would have been birds of prey like the extinct Haast's eagle and Eyles' harrier and the extant Swamp harrier.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the male}} and female are {{involved}} in the nest building. The male does most of the work, while the female perches on the shrub or tree where the nest is being built to watch for predators. The nest is built approximately three to ten feet above the ground. The outer part of the nest is composed of twigs, while the inner part is lined with grasses, dead leaves, moss, or artificial fibers. The eggs are a light blue or greenish color and speckled with dots. The female lays three to five eggs, and she incubates them for nearly two weeks. Once the eggs are hatched, both {{the male and}} female <b>will</b> <b>feed</b> the chicks.|$|E
5|$|Butterflies {{have the}} typical four-stage insect life cycle. Winged adults lay eggs {{on the food}} plant on which their larvae, known as {{caterpillars}}, <b>will</b> <b>feed.</b> The caterpillars grow, sometimes very rapidly, and when fully developed, pupate in a chrysalis. When metamorphosis is complete, the pupal skin splits, the adult insect climbs out, and after its wings have expanded and dried, it flies off. Some butterflies, especially in the tropics, have several generations in a year, while others have a single generation, and a few in cold locations may take several years to pass through their whole life cycle.|$|E
50|$|Gray-banded kingsnakes feed {{primarily}} on lizards. They <b>will</b> occasionally <b>feed</b> on small rodents, frogs, and the eggs of ground nesting birds, lizards, and other snakes.|$|R
50|$|N. brichardi specializes on feeding {{from the}} rocky biocover, picking at small {{crustaceans}} and invertebrates. It <b>will</b> also <b>feed</b> on swarms of plankton when available.|$|R

5|$|The American crow is omnivorous. It <b>will</b> <b>feed</b> on {{invertebrates}} of all types, carrion, {{scraps of}} human food, seeds, eggs and nestlings, stranded {{fish on the}} shore and various grains. American crows are active hunters and will prey on mice, frogs, and other small animals. In winter and autumn, the diet of American crows is more dependent on nuts and acorns. Occasionally, they will visit bird feeders. The American crow {{is one of only}} a few species of bird that has been observed modifying and using tools to obtain food.|$|E
5|$|The female incubates for 12–14 {{days before}} the altricial chicks are hatched naked and blind. Fledging takes another 10–19 (average 13.6) days, with both parents feeding the young and {{removing}} faecal sacs. The nest is often ill-concealed {{compared with those of}} other species, and many breeding attempts fail due to predation. The young are fed by the parents for up to three weeks after leaving the nest, and will follow the adults begging for food. If the female starts another nest, the male alone <b>will</b> <b>feed</b> the fledged young. Second broods are common, with the female reusing the same nest if the brood was successful, and three broods may be raised in the south of the common blackbird's range.|$|E
5|$|The fulmarine petrels are generalists, {{which for}} the most part take many species of fish and crustacea. The giant petrels, uniquely for Procellariiformes, <b>will</b> <b>feed</b> on land, eating the carrion of other seabirds and seals. They will also attack the chicks of other seabirds. The diet of the giant petrels varies {{according}} to sex, with the females taking more krill and the males more carrion. All the fulmarine petrels readily feed on fisheries discards at sea, a habit that has been implicated in (but not proved to have caused) the expansion in range of the northern fulmar in the Atlantic.|$|E
50|$|The {{red grouse}} is herbivorous and feeds {{mainly on the}} shoots, seeds and flowers of heather. It <b>will</b> also <b>feed</b> on berries, cereal crops and {{sometimes}} insects.|$|R

50|$|The {{lavender}} tang is an herbivore that grazes {{primarily on}} benthic algae. In captivity, they <b>will</b> also <b>feed</b> on animal matter such as brine shrimp and mysis shrimp.|$|R
5|$|The greater {{adjutant}} is omnivorous {{and although}} mainly a scavenger, it preys on frogs and large insects and will also take birds, reptiles and rodents. It {{has been known}} to attack wild ducks coming within reach and swallowing them whole. Their main diet however is carrion and like the vultures their bare head and neck is an adaptation. They are often found on garbage dumps and <b>will</b> <b>feed</b> on animal and human excreta. In 19th-century Calcutta, they fed on partly burnt human corpses disposed along the Ganges river. In Rajasthan, where it is extremely rare, it has been reported to feed on swarms of desert locusts (Schistocerca gregaria) but this has been questioned.|$|E
5|$|Though the Pacific {{electric}} ray <b>will</b> <b>feed</b> at any hour, it responds to prey {{much more quickly}} at night than during the day. Most prey captures occur in darkness or turbid conditions, when its eyes are largely useless. Instead, it relies on electroreception via its ampullae of Lorenzini to locate food. Experiments in the field have shown that it will attack artificially generated electric fields and conductive metal electrodes. Mechanical sensory cues, detected via the lateral line, also play an important role: this species has been observed preferentially attacking faster-moving prey even if a closer food item was available.|$|E
5|$|A carnivore, the caracal {{typically}} preys upon small mammals, {{birds and}} rodents. Studies in South Africa {{have reported that}} it preys on the Cape grysbok, the common duiker, sheep, goats, bush vlei rats, rock hyraxes, hare and birds. A study in western India showed that rodents comprise {{a significant portion of}} the diet. They <b>will</b> <b>feed</b> from a variety of sources, but tend to focus on the most abundant one. Grasses and grapes are taken occasionally to clear their immune system and stomach of any parasites. Larger antelopes such as young kudu, bushbuck, impala, mountain reedbuck and springbok may also be targeted. Mammals generally comprise at least 80 percent of the diet. Lizards, snakes and insects are infrequently eaten. They are notorious for attacking livestock, but rarely attack humans.|$|E
50|$|These owls take mainly rodents {{and other}} small mammals as their prey, but <b>will</b> also <b>feed</b> on birds, bats, insects and other {{invertebrates}} according to what is available.|$|R
25|$|Agelaia pallipes <b>will</b> {{normally}} <b>feed</b> {{on other}} insects (flies, moths, butterflies), however, {{it has been}} recently discovered that A. pallipes <b>will</b> also <b>feed</b> on carrion. Though the collection of bodily fluids is preferred, the wasp will also settle to take carrion morsels to their larvae; furthermore, {{it has been documented}} in recent studies that they will chew tissues of cavities in order to find liquids. Interestingly, A. pallipes was observed to feed on carrion primarily during the fresh stage (98% of occurrences) which can lead to significant forensic importance when determining the post-mortem interval.|$|R
25|$|Automixers balance {{multiple}} sound sources {{based on}} each source's level, quickly and dramatically adjusting the various signal levels automatically. Automixers {{are used in}} live sound reinforcement to maintain a steady limit on the overall signal level of the microphones; if a public address system is set up so that one microphone <b>will</b> not <b>feed</b> back, then, in general, multiple microphones <b>will</b> not <b>feed</b> back if they are automixed. The equivalent number of open mics (NOM) present at {{the output of the}} automixer is kept low, regardless of the actual number of open mics.|$|R
5|$|Megatron sends Starscream, and {{his twin}} {{brothers}} Thundercracker and Skywarp to reactivate an Energon bridge which <b>will</b> <b>feed</b> the station with raw Energon, allowing the manufacturing of more Dark Energon. Once they succeed, Megatron then develops {{a plan to}} infect the core of Cybertron with Dark Energon, feeling that he can {{gain control of the}} planet once it is infected. He launches a full-scale assault on the Autobot capital city of Iacon, looking for an item called the Omega Key, which he will use to enter Cybertron's core and infect it. The Decepticons learn that Zeta Prime has placed the key under his personal guard. Megatron's forces enter the chambers of Zeta Prime and defeat him in battle. Zeta Prime tells Megatron that the Omega Key is not actually what unlocks access to the core, but is the means to activate the true key, a colossal Transformer known as Omega Supreme. After hearing this, Megatron presumably kills Zeta Prime.|$|E
5|$|Most mysticetes reside at the poles. So, {{to prevent}} the unborn calf from dying of frostbite, they migrate to calving/mating grounds. They will then stay there for {{a matter of months}} until the calf has {{developed}} enough blubber to survive the bitter temperatures of the poles. Until then, the calves <b>will</b> <b>feed</b> on the mother's fatty milk. With the exception of the humpback whale, it is largely unknown when whales migrate. Most will travel from the Arctic or Antarctic into the tropics to mate, calve, and raise during the winter and spring; they will migrate back to the poles in the warmer summer months so the calf can continue growing while the mother can continue eating, as they fast in the breeding grounds. One exception to this is the southern right whale, which migrates to Patagonia and western New Zealand to calve; both are well out of the tropic zone.|$|E
5|$|Most terns hunt fish by diving, often {{hovering}} first, and {{the particular}} approach technique used can help to distinguish similar species at a distance. Sea terns often hunt in association with porpoises or predatory fish, such as bluefish, tuna or bonitos, since these large marine animals drive the prey to the surface. Sooty terns feed at night as the fish rise to the surface, and are believed {{to sleep on the}} wing since they become waterlogged easily. Terns of several species <b>will</b> <b>feed</b> on invertebrates, following the plough or hunting on foot on mudflats. The marsh terns normally catch insects in the air or pick them off the surface of fresh water. Other species will sometimes use these techniques if the opportunity arises. An individual tern's foraging efficiency increases with its age.|$|E
