The <b>watery</b> <b>spray</b> {{consisted of}} about 20 tiny droplets containing two to several larvae. Crawling first-instar larvae exhibited negative geotactic and phototropic responses; they {{were subject to}} rapid desic-cation and became immobile as the tiny droplets dried within a few seconds. When 5 - 50 larvae from diss-ected females were dropped in physiological saline onto {{different areas of the}} muzzle of restrained reindeer, only larvae placed deep within the nostrils and on the lips crawled out-of- sight down the nostril passage or into the mouth. Drops of larvae placed elswhere quickly desiccated and the larvae became immobile. Larvae deposited by wild females onto a CO z-baited reindeer model with the muzzle, lips and nostrils coated with insect trapping adhesive all were stuck only along the dorsal lip below the philtrum.
