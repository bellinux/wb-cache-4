5|$|Mary {{wished to}} retire to Castile {{and live with}} her {{recently}} widowed sister Eleanor, near Charles, who had retired. She <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> of moving to Castile because, although her mentally unstable mother Joanna (who died aged 77 in April 1555) had been sovereign there, Mary had never lived in Castile. She <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> that Eleanor's death would leave her alone in a country whose customs she did not know. In the end, she {{decided to move to}} Castile, while retaining the possibility of moving back to the Netherlands in case she could not adjust to the Castilian customs. Charles, Eleanor, and Mary sailed from Ghent on 15 September 1556.|$|E

5|$|In Istanbul Brand {{was told}} that Moshe Sharett was unable to obtain a visa for Turkey. The Jewish Agency asked Brand to meet him instead in Aleppo on the Syrian-Turkish border. He was reluctant; the area was under British control and he <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> {{they would want to}} {{question}} him, but the Agency told him it would be safe and he left by train with two of its delegates.|$|E

5|$|Rowling {{found it}} {{difficult}} to finish Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets because she <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> it would not live up to the expectations raised by Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in the US). After delivering the manuscript to Bloomsbury on schedule, she took it back for six weeks of revision.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1942, the Allies {{provided}} military aid, {{and then}} they began imposing economic sanctions in 1943 to force Turkey to enter the war. The western Allied powers wanted Turkey to become engaged in a fight against Germany's eastern flank; however, Turkey <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> of being overrun by the Russian and German armies, {{both of which were}} led by dictators.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{his life}} Kafka sent a {{postcard}} to his friend Hugo Bergman in Tel Aviv, announcing his intention to emigrate to Palestine. Bergman refused to host Kafka because he had young children and <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> that Kafka would infect them with tuberculosis.|$|E
5|$|Actress Shweta Bhardwaj was {{therefore}} selected {{to perform the}} item number instead. She was friends with Jagannadh, and he approached her for this song during the film's shoot at Mumbai, saying that the song suited her and her personality as a dancer. She also tried to {{understand the meaning of}} the lyrics while dancing. Bhardwaj <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> of dancing, suspecting a possible sprain, and found the costumes uneasy, but had to continue upon the choreographer's insistence. Canadian-born Indian actress Ayesha Shiva was signed to play Kajal's friend in the film.|$|E
5|$|Against Oueddei stood freshly arrived French forces. Already in 1977, after Oueddei first offensives, Malloum {{had asked}} for a French {{military}} return in Chad, but President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing was at first reluctant to commit himself before the 1978 legislative elections; also, France <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> of damaging its profitable commercial and diplomatic relations with Libya. However, the rapid deterioration {{of the situation in}} Chad resolved the President on 20 February 1978 to start Opération Tacaud, which by April brought 2,500 troops to Chad to secure the capital from the rebels.|$|E

5|$|In 1972 Pontjo Nasution offered Chrisye the {{opportunity}} to play in New York. Although ecstatic, Chrisye <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> of telling his father, who he thought would disapprove of the idea. He eventually fell ill for several months, during which time the rest of the band left for New York. After Chrisye discussed his fears with Joris and his mother, his father agreed that he could drop out of college to join Gipsy. After his health improved, in mid-1973, he left with Pontjo to meet Gipsy in New York. That same year he dropped out of Trisakti.|$|E
5|$|Laubenstein {{developed}} appendicitis in 1984 and <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> {{to undergo}} surgery {{because of the}} risk that general anesthesia would pose to her lungs, already compromised from polio. After the operation, her surgeons had trouble weaning her off the ventilator and she suffered a psychotic breakdown requiring admission to a psychiatric hospital; the psychiatrists theorized that her hallucinations were caused by hypoxia from the anesthesia. In 1990, she fell ill with a combination of asthma, gastroenteritis and respiratory failure, though she continued to work. She started taking corticosteroids for her respiratory problems—which were exacerbated by allergies to her two pet cats—and was unable to wean herself off them despite experiencing side effects.|$|E
5|$|Mahesh's seven-year-old son, Gautham Krishna, {{was chosen}} to play the younger version of the protagonist in his Telugu cinema debut. According to Sukumar, Gautham looked like the actor did as a child. When the {{director}} approached Mahesh and his wife, Namrata Shirodkar, Gautham Krishna was only six and they were apprehensive. His introduction scene was filmed silently by Peter Hein, since the boy <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> of gunfire. Naveen Polisetty played a supporting role as Mahesh's friend in the film, and Vikram Singh was signed as an antagonist. Nassar, Pradeep Rawat, Kelly Dorji, Sayaji Shinde and Anu Hasan were cast in other supporting roles.|$|E

5|$|One artist {{agreed to}} assist anonymously; {{he said that}} he <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> for his and his family's safety. According to Bluitgen, one artist {{declined}} due to the murder in Amsterdam of the film director Theo van Gogh the year before; another cited the attack in October 2004 on a lecturer at the Carsten Niebuhr Institute at the University of Copenhagen; he was assaulted by five assailants who opposed his reading of the Qur'an to non-Muslims during a lecture. The story gained some traction, and the major Danish newspapers reported the story the following day.|$|E
5|$|Some {{accounts}} of Nostradamus's life state that he <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> of being persecuted for heresy by the Inquisition, but neither prophecy nor astrology fell in this bracket, {{and he would}} have been in danger only if he had practised magic to support them. In 1538 he came into conflict with the Church in Agen after an Inquisitor visited the area looking for Anti-Catholic views. His brief imprisonment at Marignane in late 1561 was solely because he had violated a recent royal decree by publishing his 1562 almanac without the prior permission of a bishop.|$|E
5|$|The Representatives' Centralization's {{relationship}} to the SPD was ambivalent. The organization was allied with the SPD and supported the Erfurt Program. At the same time, the party mostly opposed {{the founding of the}} Representatives' Centralization and called upon its members to rejoin the centralized trade unions. The FVdG remained affiliated with the SPD, which in turn tolerated it because the SPD <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> a split would lead to a large loss of members. The FVdG stated it would rejoin the centralized trade unions like the SPD leadership desired only if the centralized unions accepted the FVdG's organizational principles.|$|E

5|$|Unlike Eno's {{previous}} albums, {{which were}} recorded {{in a very short}} time, Before and After Science was two years in the making. During this two-year period, Eno was busy working on his solo ambient music albums Music for Films and Discreet Music. Due to the very positive critical reception accorded his previous rock music-oriented album Another Green World, Eno <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> of repeating himself but still wanted to release a high-quality product.|$|E
5|$|While other spies such as Julius and Ethel Rosenberg and Klaus Fuchs {{were caught}} after the war, Koval {{apparently}} went unscrutinized for years. Among the reasons given for his maintained cover was that inter-service politics undermined efforts to perform proper security checks on employees. Another {{possibility is that}} the U.S. government chose scientific ability over clear records and political sympathies. In the 1950s, the FBI investigated his wartime activities and interviewed his former colleagues, leaving them {{with the impression that}} he might have been a spy. The matter was kept confidential for sixty years as the US <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> of the damage that would result from the exposure of Koval's activities.|$|E
5|$|Despite being {{known for}} his smoking character, Davis quit smoking in the 1970s; when The X-Files started up, {{he was given a}} choice between herbal {{cigarettes}} and tobacco cigarettes. At first, he chose to use tobacco cigarettes, but switched to herbal because he <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> of becoming addicted to them again. Davis used his notoriety on the show to assist the Canadian Cancer Society in its programs to combat smoking. In 2014, Davis donated his investments that support fossil fuels to the David Suzuki Foundation in an effort to both ethically invest, and help fund work to fight climate change. Davis is a passionate advocate for action in response to climate change, believes it is a critical issue of our time and speaks on the subject often. Taking action on a personal level, Davis drives a Tesla powered by hydroelectricity.|$|E
