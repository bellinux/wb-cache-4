5|$|In the past, {{during the}} fasting month of Ramadan, the Musaher {{of a town}} <b>would</b> <b>yell</b> and beat his drum to wake up the town's {{residents}} for suhoor (lit. 'of dawn')—usually {{very early in the}} morning, ranging from 4-6 am. The meals eaten during this time are light and foods include labaneh, cheese, bread and fried or boiled eggs along with various liquids to drink. The muezzin's call to dawn prayers signaled the beginning of sawm or fasting.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{originally}} released for the Amiga and Atari ST in 1991, running at a display resolution of 320×200 pixels. These versions received less play-testing than other versions, making for a less-fluid game, but the Amiga's sound capabilities afford it a high sound quality compared to contemporary ports. The game released on the Atari ST is identical, {{but with a}} less refined sound, and its colors are less sharp than on Amiga. These versions had code wheel protection that {{made it difficult to}} use unauthorized copies, forcing the player to enter a code (series of figures) looked up from a code wheel that came with the game. The player had to turn the wheel according to the number that was requested in the screen whenever the game is loaded in order to reload the game. Another small change between the Amiga and ST versions and the others was that Lester <b>would</b> <b>yell</b> as he grabs the vine in the first area if he was not being chased by the beast in these versions; this feature was omitted from most other versions.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the game}} began, Dave <b>would</b> always <b>yell,</b> [...] "Make them squeal; spin that wheel!" ...|$|R
5000|$|The Loud Librarian {{starring}} Lori Beth Denberg, as {{a librarian}} who <b>would</b> ironically <b>yell</b> out, [...] "Quiet, {{this is a}} libary!sic" [...] along {{with a variety of}} noisemakers whenever the silence in her library was accidentally violated.|$|R
50|$|During {{the tour}} Waters began to exhibit {{increasingly}} aggressive behaviour, and <b>would</b> often <b>yell</b> abusively at disruptive audiences who <b>would</b> not stop <b>yelling</b> and screaming during the quieter numbers. In the New York shows {{they had to}} use local workers as lighting technicians due to union problems with their own crew. They had several difficulties with the workers; for example, Waters once had to beckon one of the spotlights to move higher when it only illuminated his lower legs and feet while he was singing.|$|R
500|$|Seen {{as a joke}} {{referencing}} {{the demise}} of the Beatles' record label, the Apple logo was presented on Extra Texture as an eaten-away apple core. In addition, the blue inner-sleeve photo of Harrison – [...] "grinning like a Monty Python choirboy", in the words of Robert Christgau – was captioned [...] "OHNOTHIMAGEN" [...] ("Oh not him again"), Harrison's self-deprecating take on his dwindling popularity in 1974–75. The album's full title was a pun on the slogan that street-corner paperboys <b>would</b> <b>yell</b> out to sell late-breaking news editions of their newspapers: [...] "Extra! Extra! Read all about it!" [...] Harrison had intended to call the album Ohnothimagen, until a studio discussion with Paul Stallworth suggested an alternative. According to Harrison, just as he himself was talking about an overdub needing something [...] "extra", Stallworth happened to say the word [...] "texture".|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} the video proved to {{contribute}} significantly to the album's commercial performance, as Voodoo had initially struggled to gain single-oriented success prior to the video. The commercial impact of the video and its heavy rotation on music video networks, however, lead to D'Angelo's building image as a sex icon to a younger generation of music fans. Despite the publicity surrounding Voodoo being escalated by the video's appeal, {{the appeal of the}} album was almost overshadowed, commercially, by the video. The video's success also lead to mounting frustrations during the supporting tour for Voodoo, during which female fans and audience members <b>would</b> <b>yell</b> out for D'Angelo to take his clothes off on stage. Dominique Trenier, who served as D'Angelo's manager from 1996 to 2005, later explained his disappointment of the music video's effect on D'Angelo, stating [...] "to this day, in the general populace's memory, he's the naked dude".|$|E
500|$|Broderick's moves were choreographed by Kenny Ortega (who later choreographed Dirty Dancing). Much {{of it had}} to be {{scrapped}} {{though as}} Broderick had injured his knee badly during the scenes of running through neighbors' backyards. [...] "I was pretty sore", Broderick said. [...] "I got well enough to do {{what you see in the}} parade there, but I couldn't do most of Kenny Ortega's knee spins and things like that that we had worked on. When we did shoot it, we had all this choreography and I remember John <b>would</b> <b>yell</b> with a megaphone, 'Okay, do it again, but don't do any of the choreography,' because he wanted it to be a total mess." [...] "Danke Schoen" [...] was somewhat choreographed but for [...] "Twist and Shout", Broderick said, [...] "we were just making everything up". Hughes explained that much of the scene was spontaneously filmed. [...] "It just happened that this was an actual parade, which we put our float into—unbeknownst to anybody, all the people on the reviewing stand. Nobody knew what it was, including the governor." ...|$|E
5000|$|The album's {{title is}} {{an homage to}} former drummer Gary Young, who <b>would</b> {{frequently}} <b>yell</b> [...] "Wowee zowee!" [...] when excited. The phrase also notably dates to Frank Zappa and The Mothers of Invention's 1966 album Freak Out!, which featured a track titled [...] "Wowie Zowie".|$|R
50|$|In this episode, Ross is lectured by Brian and Kate {{about his}} poor study habits. Ross's {{explanation}} {{that he was}} watching a Brady Bunch marathon only angers his parents more, and he is warned to shape up. Ross bemoans his predicament, noting Mike Brady <b>would</b> never <b>yell</b> at him because he had flagging grades.|$|R
5000|$|Once {{they got}} to the vault, Hamilton erred by {{allowing}} a steel gate to close and lock between him and Fisher. Fisher now could only hand stacks of $5 bills to Hamilton through the bars, greatly reducing the gangs take from $250,000 to $52,000. [...] During the robbery, Green <b>would</b> periodically <b>yell</b> out the time to the others.|$|R
500|$|Other {{times on}} the set were not as smooth. The shoot was an arduous {{experience}} that [...] "cemented Cameron's formidable reputation as 'the scariest man in Hollywood'. He became known as an uncompromising, hard-charging perfectionist" [...] and a [...] "300-decibel screamer, a modern-day Captain Bligh with a megaphone and walkie-talkie, swooping down into people's faces on a 162ft crane". Winslet chipped a bone in her elbow during filming and had been worried that she would drown in the 17m-gallon water tank the ship was to be sunk in. [...] "There were times when I was genuinely frightened of him. Jim has a temper like you wouldn't believe," [...] she said. [...] "'God damn it!' he <b>would</b> <b>yell</b> at some poor crew member, 'that's exactly what I didn't want!'" [...] Her co-star, Bill Paxton, was familiar with Cameron's work ethic from his earlier experience with him. [...] "There {{were a lot of}} people on the set. Jim is not one of those guys who has the time to win hearts and minds," [...] he said. The crew felt Cameron had an evil alter ego and so nicknamed him [...] "Mij" [...] (Jim spelt backwards). In response to the criticism, Cameron stated, [...] "Film-making is war. A great battle between business and aesthetics." ...|$|E
2500|$|Georgia end Smack Thompson <b>would</b> <b>yell</b> {{out in his}} sleep, and {{had said}} [...] "Kill the SOB" [...] in {{reference}} to Doug Wycoff {{leading up to the}} game. Once during the game, the two collided with each other, knocking each unconscious.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the bonus}} track of Dane Cook's [...] "Harmful if Swallowed" [...] {{he speaks of}} how a person would wake up and think he is late, then look at his clock {{to find out that}} he is in fact late. [...] He <b>would</b> <b>yell</b> [...] "I HATE it when I'm like Nostradamus and I predict that I'm late!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Organized February 14, 1914, the Trinity Volunteer Fire Department {{began with}} 12 volunteers, 500 feet of hose, a shotgun and [...] "some mighty strong lungs." [...] When a fire broke out, one member would fire the shotgun {{and the rest}} <b>would</b> start <b>yelling.</b> Today TVFD members have {{advanced}} firefighting certification from the State Firemen's and Fire Marshal's Association.|$|R
60|$|They {{moved off}} slowly after this in {{something}} of a semicircle. Occasionally {{one or the other}} <b>would</b> raise a <b>yell,</b> but to these cries no answer was returned.|$|R
60|$|Despite this {{warning the}} lad <b>would</b> have <b>yelled</b> to his brothers, {{but he found}} this impossible. He had been {{attacked}} by Merrick and Shelley, and Cuffer stood nearby, ready with a stick, to crack him over the head should he show fight. The attack had come in the dark, the gas lamp and the lantern, having been extinguished when the party from the Josephine drew close.|$|R
2500|$|This is {{generally}} done {{by using a}} physical representation of a trader's intentions with his hands. [...] If a trader wants to buy ten contracts at a price of eight, for example, in the pit he <b>would</b> <b>yell</b> [...] "8 for 10", stating price before quantity, and turn his palm inward toward his face, putting his index finger to his forehead denoting ten; {{if he were to}} be buying one, he would place his index finger on his chin. [...] If the trader wants to sell five contracts at a price of eight, they <b>would</b> <b>yell</b> [...] "5 at 8", stating quantity before price, and show one hand with palm facing outward, showing 5 fingers. [...] The combination of hand-signals and vocal representation between the way a trader expresses bids and offers is a protection against misinterpretation by other market participants. For historical purposes, an illustrated project to record the hand signal language used in CBOT's trading pits has been compiled and published.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1977 the Houston Astros {{introduced}} {{their very}} first mascot, Chester Charge. Created by Ed Henderson, Chester Charge was a Texas cavalry soldier on a horse. Chester {{appeared on the}} field {{at the beginning of}} each home game, during the seventh inning stretch and then ran around the bases at the conclusion of each win. At the blast of a bugle, the scoreboard would light up and the audience <b>would</b> <b>yell,</b> [...] "Charge!" ...|$|E
2500|$|A 1914 {{football}} {{game against the}} Carlisle Indians provides another myth. [...] According to this story, there was a lineman/tackle named Bald Eagle on the Indians' team. [...] Attempting to exhaust that player, Auburn's team began running multiple plays directly at his position. [...] Without even huddling, the Auburn quarterback Lucy Hairston <b>would</b> <b>yell</b> [...] "Bald Eagle," [...] letting {{the rest of the}} team know that the play would be run at the tackle. [...] Spectators, however, thought the quarterback was saying [...] "War Eagle," [...] and began to chant that.|$|E
500|$|When Ryan {{was finally}} readmitted in April, {{a group of}} {{families}} withdrew their children and started an alternative school. Threats of violence and lawsuits persisted. According to Ryan's mother, {{people on the street}} <b>would</b> often <b>yell,</b> [...] "we know you're queer" [...] at Ryan. The editors and publishers of the Kokomo Tribune, which supported Ryan both editorially and financially, were also ridiculed by members of the community and threatened with death for their actions.|$|R
5000|$|This {{actually}} {{stemmed from}} the way Posadas [...] "wrote" [...] his documents. They were usually the transcript of speeches delivered at party events, whether {{with a small group}} of closest collaborators, or larger activities. In the early years, after Posadas ended his speeches with [...] "¡Viva la Revolución Mundial!" [...] and [...] "¡Viva la Cuarta Internacional!", someone else <b>would</b> traditionally <b>yell</b> [...] "¡Viva el camarada Posadas!" [...] - all this would be duly reported in print.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} days of the show, the program {{featured}} several scripted comedy skits which centered around Alice and his life. Many of these featured Alice getting into arguments with rock musicians who asked Cooper for money he allegedly owed them for shows. These arguments would ultimately result in Cooper getting beaten senseless by the artists, who <b>would</b> often <b>yell</b> [...] "and THIS is for making fun of RUSH!" [...] (which was a common joke of Cooper's at the time.) ...|$|R
2500|$|The game renewed {{play again}} in 1925. That year, Tech quarterback Ike Williams thought the game clock read five seconds {{remaining}} {{in the third quarter}} when in actuality it was five minutes. [...] Williams set up his offense for a field goal and kicked it to put Tech up 3–0 on first down. Luckily for Williams, Tech won 3–0. Georgia end Smack Thompson <b>would</b> <b>yell</b> out in his sleep, and had said [...] "Kill the SOB" [...] in reference to Tech's star fullback Doug Wycoff leading up to the game. Once during the game, the two collided with each other, knocking each unconscious.|$|E
2500|$|By late 1990, Phish's concerts were {{becoming}} more and more intricate, often making a consistent effort to involve the audience in the performance. In a special [...] "secret language", the audience would react in a certain manner based on a particular musical cue from the band. For instance, if Anastasio [...] "teased" [...] a motif from The Simpsons theme song, the audience <b>would</b> <b>yell,</b> [...] "D'oh!" [...] in imitation of [...] In 1992, Phish introduced a collaboration between audience and band called the [...] "Big Ball Jam" [...] in which each band member would throw a large beach ball into the audience and play a note each time his ball was hit. In so doing, the audience was helping to create an original composition.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fighting}} on the beachhead at Iwo Jima was very fierce. The advance of the Marines was stalled by numerous defensive positions augmented by artillery pieces. There, the Marines were ambushed by Japanese troops who occasionally sprang out of tunnels. At night, the Japanese left their defenses {{under cover of darkness}} to attack American foxholes, but U.S. Navy ships fired star shells to deny them the cover of darkness. On Iwo Jima (and other Japanese held islands), Japanese soldiers who knew English were used to harass and or deceive Marines in order to kill them if they could; they <b>would</b> <b>yell</b> [...] "corpsman" [...] pretending to be a wounded Marine, in order to lure in U.S. Navy medical corpsmen attached to Marine infantry companies.|$|E
5000|$|During a challenge, the {{audience}} <b>would</b> cheer by <b>yelling</b> the contestant's name, followed by three claps {{for the first}} thirty seconds (e.g. [...] "Lucy *clap* *clap* *clap* Lucy *clap* *clap* *clap*"). In the last ten seconds, {{the audience}} would countdown from ten to one.|$|R
5000|$|Signac {{commented on}} meeting up with van Gogh, [...] "I would {{encounter}} him at Asnières and at Saint-Ouen. We painted {{together on the}} riverbanks, we lunched at roadside cafes and we returned by foot to Paris via the Avenues of Saint-Ouen and Clichy. Van Gogh, wearing the blue overalls of a zinc worker, would have little dots of color painted on his shirtsleeves. Striking quite close to me, he <b>would</b> be <b>yelling,</b> gesticulating and brandishing a large size-thirty, freshly painted canvas; in this fashion he would manage to polychrome both himself and the passers-by." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{idea that}} <b>would</b> become Just <b>Yell</b> Fire began when Jessup saw a news report {{including}} footage of Carlie Brucia being led away by Joseph P. Smith. Jessup contacted Chad Von Dette, who had instructed her in Filipino street fighting, {{and asked him}} to develop a method they could teach which would allow young girls to avoid Brucia's fate.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, then," [...] {{cried the}} Bu'ster, [...] "where's the spit? Ah! that's it; here you go; oh dear, how you <b>would</b> <b>yell</b> just now, Mister Grumpy, {{if you were}} alive! It's a cruel thought, but I can't help it. There, now, frizzle away, and I'll go clean up my dishes while you are roasting." ...|$|E
6000|$|That {{changed the}} subject to dentistry. I said I {{believed}} the average man dreaded tooth-pulling more than amputation, and that he <b>would</b> <b>yell</b> quicker under the former operation than he would under the latter. The philosopher Harris said that the average man would not yell in either case if he had an audience. Then he continued: ...|$|E
60|$|Hurtle's big {{freckled}} hands closed nervously {{over the}} ball. I {{thought it best}} not to say more to him, for he had a rather wild look. I remembered my own stage fright upon my first appearance in fast company. Besides I knew what my amiable players would say to him. I had a secret hope and belief that presently they <b>would</b> <b>yell</b> upon {{the other side of}} the fence.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the final}} round when the 4 team-mates run and the blindfolded team-mates get the disc hidden in a big vat of blue slime, the {{audience}} <b>would</b> cheer by <b>yelling</b> the team's name (e.g. [...] "Alpha, Omega, Alpha, Omega...") until the blindfolded contestant found the disc. This only occurred when Adrian and Zoe hosted the show.|$|R
5000|$|Cazaly {{was famous}} {{for his ability to}} take {{spectacular}} marks despite his small stature, and at South Melbourne a teammate, Fred [...] "Skeeter" [...] Fleiter, <b>would</b> often <b>yell</b> [...] "Up there, Cazaly", a phrase that would become synonymous with Australian rules football. He initially developed his marking ability by jumping at a ball strung up in a shed at his home, and held his breath as he jumped, an action that he believed lifted him higher. He also possessed the capacity to kick a football over 65 metres. In 2009 The Australian nominated Cazaly as one of the 25 greatest footballers never to win a Brownlow Medal.|$|R
5000|$|The song also {{acquired}} a quasi-legendary role in early 1970s rock concerts, when audience members at other artists' concerts <b>would</b> semi-jokingly <b>yell</b> out [...] "Whipping Post!" [...] as a request between numbers, echoing the fan captured on At Fillmore East. [...] Jackson Browne {{took note of}} this occurring during his concerts of the time. Another such instance from 1974 in Helsinki affected rock guitarist and composer Frank Zappa, as described below. [...] Later this same yell-out-at-a-concert [...] "role" [...] would be taken over to a far greater extent by Lynyrd Skynyrd's [...] "Free Bird", although the [...] "Whipping Post" [...] tradition made something of a later comeback at indie rock shows.|$|R
