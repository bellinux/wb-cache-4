25|$|The {{right of}} abode in Hong Kong {{is the right to}} legally reside in Hong Kong <b>without</b> <b>any</b> <b>limit</b> or {{condition}} of stay being imposed by the Hong Kong Immigration Department. As the People's Republic of China stood to resume sovereignty over Hong Kong from the United Kingdom, the nationality of Hong Kong people as well as their {{right of abode}} in the territory was formalised prior to the 1997 handover. Since Hong Kong has never been an independent country, there is no provision for its own citizenship status. Hong Kong Permanent Resident is the legal status for those who have the right of abode in Hong Kong, which is the de-facto citizenship status in Hong Kong. Most citizen rights in Hong Kong (such as the right to vote) are granted to all permanent residents, while some (such as the right to hold a HKSAR passport, or becoming a high-rank public officer such as the Chief Executive) are restricted to permanent residents who are also Chinese citizens.|$|E

60|$|There were, in {{the time}} of our civil {{troubles}} in England, (I do not know whether you have any such in your Assembly in France,) several persons, like the then Earl of Holland, who by themselves or their families had brought an odium on the throne by the prodigal dispensation of its bounties towards them, who afterwards joined in the rebellions arising from the discontents of which they were themselves the cause: men who helped to subvert that throne to which they owed, some of them, their existence, others all that power which they employed to ruin their benefactor. If any bounds are set to the rapacious demands of that sort of people, or that others are permitted to partake in the objects they would engross, revenge and envy soon fill up the craving void that is left in their avarice. Confounded by the complication of distempered passions, their reason is disturbed; their views become vast and perplexed,--to others inexplicable, to themselves uncertain. They find, on all sides, bounds to their unprincipled ambition in any fixed order of things; but in the fog and haze of confusion all is enlarged, and appears <b>without</b> <b>any</b> <b>limit.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... (In {{instances}} {{of this kind}} {{the powers of the}} earth appear to be fully equal to answer it the demands for food that can be made upon it by man. But we should be led into an error if we were thence to suppose that population and food ever really increase in the same ratio. The one is still a geometrical and the other an arithmetical ratio, that is, one increases by multiplication, and the other by addition. Where there are few people, and a great quantity of fertile land, the power of the earth to afford a yearly increase of food may be compared to a great reservoir of water, supplied by a moderate stream. The faster population increases, the more help will be got to draw off the water, and consequently an increasing quantity will be taken every year. But the sooner, undoubtedly, will the reservoir be exhausted, and the streams only remain. When acre has been added to acre, till all the fertile land is occupied, the yearly increase of food will depend upon the amelioration of the land already in possession; and even this moderate stream will be gradually diminishing. But population, could it be supplied with food, would go on with unexhausted vigour, and the increase of one period would furnish the power of a greater increase the next, and this <b>without</b> <b>any</b> <b>limit.)</b> ...|$|E

40|$|The {{evolution}} of phenotypic plasticity is studied {{in a model}} with two reproductively isolated ''species'' in a coarse- grained environment, consisting of two types of habitats. A quantitative genetic model for selection was constructed, in which habitats differ in the optimal value for a focal trait, and with random dispersal among habitats. The main interest was to {{study the effects of}} different selection regimes. Three cases were investigated: (1) <b>without</b> <b>any</b> <b>limits</b> to plasticity; (2) without genetic variation for plasticity; and (3) with a fitness cost for phenotypically plastic reactions. in almost all cases a generalist strategy to exploit both habitats emerged. <b>Without</b> <b>any</b> <b>limits</b> to plasticity, optimal adaptive reactions evolved. <b>Without</b> <b>any</b> genetic variation for plasticity, a compromise strategy with an intermediate, fixed phenotype evolved, whereas in the presence of costs a plastic compromise between the demands of the habitats and the costs associated with plasticity was found. Specialization and phenotypic differentiation was only found when selection within habitats was severe and optimal phenotypes for different habitats were widely different. Under soft selection (local regulation of population numbers in each habitat) the specialists coexisted; under hard selection (global regulation of population numbers) one specialist outcompeted the other. The prevalent evolutionary outcome of compromises rather than specialization implies that costs or constraints are not necessarily detectable as local adaptation in transplantation or translocation experiments.

The contrast sensitivity was measured to visually achromatic sinusoidal grating with a spatial frequency of 0.2 to 30  cycles per degree of visual angle (cpd), using the psychophysical method of adjustment (Castro et al., 2009). The results showed no statistical difference in the visual achromatic CS between alcoholic patients and healthy volunteers. Roquelaure et al.
