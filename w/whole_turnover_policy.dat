40|$|We examine optimal {{managerial}} {{compensation and}} <b>turnover</b> <b>policy</b> in a principal-agent {{model in which}} the firm output is serially correlated over time. The model captures a learning-by-doing feature: higher effort by the manager increases {{the quality of the}} match between the firm and the manager in the future. The optimal incentive scheme entails an inefficiently high turnover rate {{in the early stages of}} the employment relationship. The optimal turnover probability depends on the past performance and the likelihood of turnover decreases gradually with superior performance. With good enough past performance, the <b>turnover</b> <b>policy</b> reaches efficiency; the manager is never retained if it is inefficient to do so. The manager’s compensation depends on the firm value and the optimal performance-compensation relation increases with past performance...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proves the}} renegotiation-proofness {{principle}} for a dynamic LEN (linear contracts, exponential utility, normal distributions) model and examines {{the impact of}} repeated renegotiation on incentives and managerial tenure when performance information is serially correlated. In addition to providing a general solution to a multiperiod agency problem with serially correlated performance measures, this paper characterizes optimal managerial tenure/turnover policies {{as a function of}} the time-series properties of performance measures. With negatively correlated performance measures, the principal prefers longer managerial tenure, and no turnover is optimal. With positively correlated performance measures, absent a switching cost, turnover every period is optimal. In the presence of a fixed switching cost, interior optimal <b>turnover</b> <b>policies</b> exist if the performance measures are positively correlated. Switching costs are necessary, but not sufficient for interior optimal tenure. The optimal <b>turnover</b> <b>policies</b> present an alternative to theories of performance-driven managerial turnover and are consistent with evidence that a majority of managerial turnovers are (age-related) normal retirements. dynamic agency, renegotiation, managerial tenure, LEN models, managerial turnover...|$|R

Moving from this consideration, we have reconstructed the economic/ financial and asset dynamics typical of the above situation; thus we have developed a valuation formula.

Members from stable groups had better group performance, group cohesion, and group dynamics, which all resulted in members displaying more trust in their colleagues and an increased willingness to cooperate with them. Implications of the findings include that stable membership is a crucial factor in the promotion of group dynamics and overall performance, and that the nature of a group’s boundary affects its membership <b>turnover.</b> <b>Policies</b> should also be devised to manage membership stability, as maintaining an appropriate turnover rate is essential both to individuals and to groups, such as employees and their organizations...|$|R

REE was assessed by indirect calorimetry (hood), whereas <b>whole</b> body protein <b>turnover</b> was estimated using a single dose of [15 N]glycine administered p. o. by measuring the isotopic enrichment of [15 N]ammonia in urine over 12 h. Within the first 3. 5 h after treatment, the body temperature dropped from 39. 8 +/- 0. 1 to 37. 8 +/- 0. 1 degrees C (p < 0. 0001), and REE followed the same pattern, decreasing rapidly from 223 +/- 6 to 187 +/- 4 kJ/kg/d (p < 0. 0001).

This study used juvenile (4 - to 5 - wk-old) and adult (12 - to 14 -wk-old) male dystrophic C 57 BL/ 10 ScSn-mdx/J and age-matched C 57 BL/ 10 ScSn/J control male mice to measure total and resting energy expenditure, food intake, spontaneous activity, body composition, <b>whole</b> body protein <b>turnover,</b> and muscle protein synthesis rates. In juvenile mdx mice that have extensive muscle damage, energy expenditure, muscle protein synthesis, and <b>whole</b> body protein <b>turnover</b> rates were higher than in age-matched controls.

40|$|The paper explores {{employment}} {{effects of}} environmental product innovations {{at the firm}} level. The empirical analysis {{is based on the}} establishment panel of the Institute for Employment Research (Nuremberg). A descriptive analysis shows that more than 50 % of the firms in the environmental sector developed new products or improved existing products or services. The most dynamic environmental fields were analytics, consulting, measurement technology, waste disposal and recycling. A firm specialised in environmental research and development seems to have the best employment perspectives in the short and in the long run. Our econometric analysis had to address a simultaneity problem because the decision of a firm on the realisation of innovations and on the enlargement or reduction of employment is mutually dependant. Therefore, we apply a bivariate probit model that allows estimating the two variables simultaneously. The econometric results show that the influence of environmental innovation activities on the employment development is significantly positive. Furthermore, the quantitative importance of the new products with regard to the <b>whole</b> <b>turnover</b> of the firm is also important for employment growth. Within the bivariate probit model, the determinants of environmental innovation activities are also explored. They may be interpreted as indirect influences on the employment development of the firm. The results show that the improvement of the innovative capacities by R&D and further education measures and the existence of a high qualified human capital are significantly important for the development of new products in the environmental sector. A good strategy to improve the innovativeness of a firm seems to be a diversification of environmental product lines offered by the firm...|$|R
