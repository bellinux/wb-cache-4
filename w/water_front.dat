25|$|Sirisena {{released}} his manifesto, titled A Compassionate Maithri Governance— A Stable Country, on 19 December 2014 {{at a rally}} at Viharamahadevi Park. The main pledge in the manifesto is {{the replacement of the}} executive presidency with a Westminster style cabinet but the manifesto acknowledges that Sirisena would need the support of the parliament to amend the constitution. The manifesto also makes a commitment to replace the open list proportional representation system with a mixture of first-past-the-post and PR for electing MPs. Parliamentary elections will be held in April 2015 after the constitution has been amended. Independent commissions will be established to oversee the judiciary, police, elections department, Auditor-General's Department and Attorney-General's Department. The Commission on Bribery and Corruption will be strengthened and political diplomatic appointments annulled. Populist measures in the manifesto include a commitment to write-off 50% of farmers' loans, reduce fuel prices by removing taxes and a salary increase of Rs.10,000 for public servants. Public spending on health would increase from 1.8% of GDP to 3% of GDP whilst that on education would increase from 1.7% of GDP to 6% of GDP. The manifesto also states that the casino licences granted to Kerry Packer's Crown Resort and John Keells Holdings's <b>Water</b> <b>Front</b> will be cancelled. Political victims during Rajapaks's rule, including Sarath Fonseka and Shirani Bandaranayake, would be re-appointed.|$|E
500|$|Several {{months after}} the events of [...] "Anarky: Tomorrow Belongs to Us", Lonnie Machin has been {{released}} from juvenile detention on parole, and uses the internet to create a company, [...] "Anarco". Through Anarco, Machin sells anarchist literature online, secretly acquiring millions of dollars. He channels this wealth through a proxy organization, [...] "The Anarkist Foundation", to donate the funds to political groups he supports, including gun protesters, eco-warriors, and clean energy lobbies. Meanwhile, he successfully hides this activity from his parents, Mike and Roxanne Machin, who do not approve of his behavior, believing themselves to have failed to raise their son properly. Their relationship with him becomes strained, {{as they attempt to}} rehabilitate him into normality, while he wishes they would be proud of his vigilante activism. Continuing his secret philanthropy, he supports Malochia, a self-proclaimed [...] "prophet of doom" [...] who spreads a message that current social conditions are intolerable. Anarky comes to suspect that this [...] "prophet" [...] has an ulterior motive, and hires private detective, Joe Potato, to investigate his actions. Meanwhile, Batman and Robin have also placed Malochia under their watch, and discover his connections to Lonni Machin. [...] Anarky, Joe Potato, and Batman confront Malochia, but are each captured and tied to a blimp. The blimp is loaded with high explosives and set to detonate {{near the center of the}} city. Malochia hopes this act will set into effect his own delusional predictions of calamity. Anarky and Joe Potato revive and steer the blimp towards the <b>water</b> <b>front,</b> still set to explode. Anarky releases both Potato and Batman into the water, but is tangled in ropes and presumably caught in the explosion. During the story, Lonnie's parents find a letter he wrote in the event of his death. The letter acts as a literary device to explain his origin as Anarky and the personal reasons behind his decision to become a vigilante. Lonnie Machin's father and mother, Mike and Roxanne raise their son to be a happy child, and encourage his intelligence and thirst for knowledge with trips to bookstores. [...] Through his research, Lonnie eventually grows to become the political radical, Anarky.|$|E

500|$|The {{triangular}} footprint and sloped {{exterior of}} Jeddah Tower {{is designed to}} reduce wind loads; its high surface area also makes it ideal for residential use. The overall design of the tower, which will be located near both the Red Sea and {{the mouth of the}} Obhur Creek (Sharm Ob'hur) where it widens as it meets the Red Sea, as well as having frontage on a man-made waterway and harbor that will be built around it, is intended to look like a desert plant shooting upwards as a symbol of Saudi Arabia's growth and future, as well as to add prominence to Jeddah's status as the gateway into the holy city of Mecca. The designer's vision was [...] "one that represents the new spirit in Saudi Arabia" [...] (Smith). The 23 hectare (57 acre) area around Jeddah Tower will contain public space and a shopping mall, as well as other residential and commercial developments, and be known as the Jeddah Tower <b>Water</b> <b>Front</b> District, of which, the tower's site alone will take up [...] As with many other very tall skyscrapers, including the Kingdom Centre in Riyadh, which is generally considered to have sparked the recent significant commercial developments around it in the district of Olaya, much of the intention of Jeddah Tower is to be symbolic as well as to raise the surrounding land value rather than its own profitability. To that effect, the tower's architect, Adrian Smith, said that the tower [...] "evokes a bundle of leaves shooting up from the ground–a burst of new life that heralds more growth all around it". Smith states that the tower will create a landmark in which it and the surrounding Jeddah Economic City are interdependent. Talal Al Maiman, a board member of Jeddah Economic Company, said, [...] "Jeddah Tower will be a landmark structure that will greatly increase the value of the hundreds of other properties around it in Jeddah Economic City and indeed throughout North Jeddah." [...] The concept of profitability derived from building high density developments and malls around such a landmark was taken from the Burj Khalifa, where it has proven successful, as its surrounding malls, hotels and condominiums in the area known as Downtown Dubai have generated the most considerable revenue out of that project as a whole, while the Burj Khalifa itself made little or no profit.|$|E

When it reaches its maximum height, the dolphin descends back into the water, landing on its side. A dolphin can make two to 5.5 spins in one leap; the swimming and rotational speed of the dolphin as it spins underwater affects the number of spins it can do while airborne. These spins may serve several functions. [...] Dolphins may also make nose-outs, tail slaps, flips, head slaps, [...] "salmon leaps", and side and back slaps.|$|E
2500|$|Then the Wobblies {{through their}} {{newspaper}} the Industrial Worker {{made the call}} for a citywide strike on May 1, 1923 (the historic May Day of international socialism).

On the same day, IWW leaders persuaded approximately 450 of 2,200 men to strike at refinery construction jobs two miles north of the harbor, and it seemed likely that the dispute would spread beyond the <b>water</b> <b>front.</b> Employers therefore decided to take immediate action both to prevent this and to move ships more rapidly. [...] Negotiations with the longshoremen, however, foundered on their demand for their own hiring hall and the abandonment of the Sea Service Bureau, or [...] "Fink Hall," [...] controlled by the stevedoring and shipping firms. Some 1,200 longshoremen voted to remain out until the employers met this basic request.|$|E

2500|$|While {{like many}} of the other larger palazzi in Venice the Palazzo Labia is {{rectangular}} in design built around an inner courtyard, the two architects Tremignon and Cominelli broke the architectural traditions of such architects as Longhena, by designing the facades of the Palazzo Labia to be more simple and less cluttered, than those of the earlier Venetian classical palazzi, [...] while still maintaining a baroque richness achieved through the effect of light and shadow, a second break with Venetian architectural tradition was that the new palazzo had three facades, it was common practice in Venice for only the waterfront facade to have a richness of detail, while the rear elevations were often an evolved mismatch of asymmetrical windows and styles. [...] The new palazzo's site being at the junction of two canals, and also bordering the Campo San Geremia provided the opportunity for three facades. [...] Hence this attention to detail of the less obvious parts of the palazzo's exterior, [...] away from its principal <b>water</b> <b>front</b> facade, was able to provide further evidence of the Labia's vast wealth.|$|E
2500|$|Wiman's {{plan called}} for a belt system using two miles of the old Staten Island Rail Road, between Vanderbilt's Landing and Tompkinsville, and the {{coordination}} of all ferries from one terminal. Previously, there were six to eight of them, located near Saint George. Wiman sought to expand the line and approached Robert Garrett, president of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, to back {{the idea of a}} large rail terminal on the island and centralize the ferry landings, who agreed. The SIRT began to seek legislation to acquire various rights-of-way that would be needed to implement Wiman's plan. This was done when the company didn't own or control a railroad. If the company gained a charter to build connections, it would have had nothing to connect to. The company then began surveying for the proposed routes. In April 1881, the company acquired 1.5 miles of critical right-of-way directly from George Law. At first, when Wiman explained his plan he was able to secure a <b>water</b> <b>front</b> option from him. However, Law refused to renew the option a second time, and to get Law to renew the option, Wiman offered to name the place"St. George." [...] The option was granted to Wiman as Law was humored by the gesture. In October 1882, Wiman made an application for a wharf to land passengers from the company's planned new ferry service to Manhattan.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the history}} of the ILA, the port of Baltimore, which was a sixth largest port in the world around the start of the 20th century, had a unique impact on the legacy of the Longshoremen's Union. Unlike the Port of New York or Boston which were {{dominated}} by Irish and German immigrants, Baltimore's stevedores and longshoremen were overwhelmingly Polish. In the 1930s about eighty percent of the Baltimore's longshoremen were Polish or of Polish descent. The port of Baltimore had an international reputation of fast cargo handling credited to the well-organized gang system that was nearly free of corruption, wildcat strikes and constant work stoppages unlike its other East coast counterparts. In fact, the New York Anti-Crime Commission and the Waterfront Commission of New York looked upon the Baltimore system as the ideal one for all ports.The hiring of longshoremen in Baltimore by the gang system dates back to 1913, when the ILA was first formed. The Polish longshoremen began setting up the system by selecting the most skilled men to lead them. This newly formed gang would usually work for the same company, which would give the priority to the gang. During the times where there was no work within the particular company, the gang would work elsewhere, or even divide to aid other groups in their work, which would speed up the work and would make it more efficient. In an environment as dangerous as a busy waterfront, the Baltimore's gangs always operated together as a unit, because the experience let them know what each member would do at any given time making a <b>water</b> <b>front</b> a much safer place. [...] At the beginning of the Second World War Polish predominance in the Port of Baltimore would significantly diminish as many Poles left to fight the war.|$|E
