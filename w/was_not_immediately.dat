By 1970, Freddie Mercury, Brian May, and Roger Taylor had already formed Queen; Deacon saw them in October that year but <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> impressed. Later in the year, he briefly formed a band called Deacon that made one live appearance at Chelsea College.|$|E

On February 3, 1952, Loring was reassigned to the 2353rd Personnel Processing Squadron at Camp Stoneman in Pittsburg, California. This unit was quickly moved to South Korea, where it was assigned to the 8th Fighter-Bomber Wing, Fifth Air Force, with the assignment of supervising training for replacement pilots before they were moved into combat units. During this time he flew with the 36th Fighter-Bomber Squadron and 80th Fighter-Bomber Squadron, while assisting the new pilots.|$|E
5|$|For the 1965 Formula One season, Rindt {{signed as}} a {{permanent}} driver with Cooper, paired with Bruce McLaren. He <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> successful as Cooper, formerly a top team, were struggling at the time. In his first race, the 1965 South African Grand Prix, he developed transistor trouble; the damage was initially repaired but the problem recurred and Rindt had to retire from the race. His best result was a fourth place at the German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring. He ended the season with four points, 13th in the championship.|$|E

5|$|It {{was officially}} {{activated}} as an airborne division in April 1943 but <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> {{sent to a}} combat theater, remaining in the United States to complete its training. During this training process, the division took part in several training exercises, including the Knollwood Maneuver, in which it played a vital part in ensuring that the airborne division remained as a military formation in the U.S. Army. As such {{it did not take}} part in the first two large-scale airborne operations conducted by the Allies, Operation Husky and Operation Neptune, transferring to Britain only after the end of Operation Overlord.|$|E
5|$|King Edward's Horse was mobilised in August 1914, but <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> sent overseas. In December 1914, Herring was {{commissioned}} {{as a second}} lieutenant in the Royal Field Artillery, and was posted to B Battery, 99th Field Artillery Brigade of the British 22nd Division. The division moved to the Western Front in August 1915, but was there only a month before being transferred to the Macedonian front, where it served {{for the rest of}} the war.|$|E
5|$|Pam made a brief {{appearance}} in the 12th season premiere, with a different appearance {{as a result of}} plastic surgery (which also doubled as an explanation for Margaret Michaels playing the role, rather than Victoria Principal). She tells her brother Cliff that she is happy in her new life and plans to marry her doctor. Later, after Cliff leaves, her doctor asks why she didn't tell Cliff that she has a terminal disease and only has a year to live. This was the character's final {{appearance in}} the series, although Pam <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> declared dead on the show.|$|E

5|$|Sakura {{has become}} the series' female lead, although, she <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> {{intended}} for the role. Kishimoto has had difficulty drawing her character resulting in Kishimoto inadvertently emphasizing certain parts of her appearance, including her large forehead. In {{order to make the}} character more appealing {{in the second part of}} the series, Kishimoto designed her costume to make her look more like a martial artist as well as more beautiful during later chapters. Chie Nakamura voices the character in the animated adaptations of the series, while Kate Higgins plays her in the English dub.|$|E
5|$|The Triangle Link {{was passed}} by the various {{municipal}} councils in February and March 1988. Hordaland Public Roads Administration still supported a pontoon bridge, and stated that {{two and a half years}} of work on a master plan had been wasted. A new master plan for the Triangle Link was published in early 1989. During late 1989, advance tolls on the ferries was approved by the municipal councils and the county council. They recommended that collection start on 1 July 1990, but this <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> supported by the government.|$|E
5|$|The club's {{return to}} the First Division <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> successful. Under Leslie Knighton, the club never {{finished}} better than ninth, and in 1923–24 came close to returning to the Second Division, finishing 19th and only a point clear of the relegation zone. Arsenal did no better the following season, finishing 20th (although paradoxically the club were a lot safer this time, being seven points clear of the relegation places), which {{was the last straw}} for Norris; he fired Knighton in May 1925, and appointed the Huddersfield Town manager, Herbert Chapman in his place.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} Hurricane Fausto {{were from a}} {{tropical}} wave that emerged into the eastern Atlantic Ocean from {{the west coast of}} Africa on August11. It crossed the Atlantic and Caribbean uneventfully. The tropical wave ultimately entered the Eastern Pacific Basin on August 17. Rapidly organizing, the system was classified using the Dvorak technique at 1800UTC on August18. Although a broad closed circulation was present on August19, the system became less organized and thus <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> classified as a tropical depression.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} Arms and the Man <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> replicated. Candida, which {{presented}} {{a young woman}} making a conventional romantic choice for unconventional reasons, received a single performance in South Shields in 1895; in 1897 a playlet about Napoleon called The Man of Destiny had a single staging at Croydon. In the 1890s Shaw's plays were better known in print than on the West End stage; his biggest success of the decade was in New York in 1897, when Richard Mansfield's production of the historical melodrama The Devil's Disciple earned the author more than £2,000 in royalties.|$|E
5|$|A bill {{setting out}} {{arrangements}} for funding and building the fleet was finalized in mid-July 1914. At {{this time the}} Navy had not yet settled on a final battleship design. It was planned that the first ship's keel would be laid in December 1914 and fitting out be completed sometime in 1918. The bill <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> introduced into parliament, however, as Idenburg was given until 10 August to comment on it. The outbreak of the First World War led to the bill being withdrawn due to the uncertain international circumstances and the impossibility of buying battleships from foreign shipbuilders in wartime. Instead, the Government ordered three s in 1915, though only two were completed.|$|E

The South China Morning Post reported that policemen stationed inside their apartment {{at the time of the}} announcement prevented Liu Xia from meeting with journalists and other well-wishers. It <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> clear whether Liu Xiaobo was aware of the award. By that time, Liu Xia said she had been told she would be taken to Liaoning to see her husband in prison. Meetings and gatherings to celebrate in several cities were prevented or abruptly broken up by police; one such celebration dinner in Beijing, attended by 20 people, was broken up by police, and the attendees were detained.|$|E
5|$|Branford is {{the first}} {{previously}} rebuilt station to be further renovated with a second platform. A $60 million bond in February 2011 included $16.5 million for a second platform and pedestrian bridge at Branford, $7.3 million for platform extensions at Guilford, and $11 million to add catenary wires to currently unwired sidings along the line. Construction on the new platform at Branford began in September 2013, and the Guilford work is under way as well. After delays, the enlarged Branford station opened on September 30, 2016, although the north platform <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> served by trains. Bidding on a second platform and three-level parking garage at Madison, planned since 2009, was scheduled to begin in 2013 but did not occur. Per the agreement with Amtrak, a second platform is planned {{to be added to}} Clinton station. The project was originally planned to start in early 2012, but has since been indefinitely delayed.|$|E
5|$|Cranmer <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> {{accepted}} by the bishops within his province. When he attempted a canonical visitation, he had to avoid locations where a resident conservative bishop might make an embarrassing personal challenge to his authority. In 1535, Cranmer had difficult encounters with several bishops, John Stokesley, John Longland, and Stephen Gardiner among others. They objected to Cranmer's power and title and argued that the Act of Supremacy did not define his role. This prompted Thomas Cromwell, the king's chief minister, to activate and to take {{the office of the}} vicegerent, the deputy supreme head of ecclesiastical affairs. He created another set of institutions that gave a clear structure to the royal supremacy. Hence, the archbishop was eclipsed by Vicegerent Cromwell in regards to the king's spiritual jurisdiction. There is no evidence that Cranmer resented his position as junior partner. Although he was an exceptional scholar, he lacked the political ability to outface even clerical opponents. Those tasks were left to Cromwell.|$|E
