In {{the case of the}} Northern region, the implied gap is 29.2 %, close to the actual gap of 30.4 %. However, neither the gender elasticity difference nor the implied gap is statistically significant from zero, due to a high variance in the female estimates. For agriculture, gender elasticities <b>are</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>different</b> (1.88 vs. 1.094, p< 0.01) but the implied gap of 24.9 % is not.

These features are already formed during embryogenesis and therefore Tocheri et al. argue that it is improbable that the shape of H.nbsp&floresiensis wrist bones could be a result of a developmental disease. This evidence also suggests that H. Florensiensis is not a modern human with an undiagnosed pathology or growth defect, but that it represents a species descended from a hominin ancestor that branched off before the last common ancestor of the clade that includes modern humans, Neandertals, and other modern hominins.|$|E
