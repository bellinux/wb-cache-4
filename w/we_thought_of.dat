500|$|Yeats {{used the}} {{occasion}} of his acceptance lecture at the Royal Academy of Sweden to present himself as a standard-bearer of Irish nationalism and Irish cultural independence. As he remarked, [...] "The theatres of Dublin were empty buildings hired by the English travelling companies, and we wanted Irish plays and Irish players. When <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> these plays <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> everything that was romantic and poetical, because the nationalism we had called up—the nationalism every generation had called up in moments of discouragement—was romantic and poetical." [...] The prize led to {{a significant increase in}} the sales of his books, as his publishers Macmillan sought to capitalise on the publicity. For the first time he had money, and he was able to repay not only his own debts, but those of his father.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{initially}} released by Bulk Recordings on May 7, 1996, under the shorter title Dr. Octagon. Although the album sold relatively well, Nakamura {{has said it}} was under-promoted because it was released by an independent label. In both the United States and United Kingdom, the album was issued by Bulk Records on vinyl as a double LP, and on compact disc with bonus tracks,. Separately, it was also issued by Mo' Wax in the UK as a triple LP, reflecting the track listing of the Bulk Recordings compact disk. [...] "When we did this record <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> it as an underground joint", Nakamura said.|$|E
500|$|As {{some critics}} have noted, Psycho-Pass explores {{societal}} and psychological themes, such {{as the price of}} living without stress, and without fear of crime. Indeed, the Sibyl System targets individuals who are considering performing actions that might cause stress to others. But this {{raises the question of whether}} it is morally and socially acceptable to charge individuals with crimes they have not yet committed. For example, in the first episode, a woman is kidnapped, and the resultant trauma causes her Psycho-Pass to become clouded. According to Sibyl's instructions, the police are therefore prepared to kill her. But Akane steps in, refusing to accept Sibyl's verdict, and manages to bring the woman's Psycho-Pass level back to the acceptable range by speaking gently to her. Consequently, this challenges the notion that the potential to commit a crime necessarily correlates with actually committing the crime. According to Anime News Network, [...] "We are all capable of doing bad things at timesshould we be punished because <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> hurting someone before we act on it? Or because we were victims? It really all comes back to that first episode and Akane's reaction to the victim who presented as a violent criminal".|$|E

500|$|A {{lot of my}} {{performances}} {{have had}} fire involved, so we thought 'Heat.' Also, red {{is one of my}} favorite colors, as is gold. So then <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> making the bottle look like it's on fire. I love antique bottles — my mother had a collection of them when I was growing up. I wanted something with an antique yet modern feeling. Even with my wardrobe, I always try to find things that have a little bit of something vintage, yet still timeless and classic. The bottle, I felt, was a great mixture of the two... Everything, from the bottle design to the name and the ideas for the commercials–that's me. When I commit to something, I do it 100 percent, and I've never had [...] until this project. I learned a lot of great things from the past — but I always asked myself, 'If I could have my own scent, what would it be?' I wasn't worried about deadlines. It could have taken me three, four, however many years — this was my first fragrance, and I wanted to make sure that it was something I would love forever.|$|E
500|$|The album's cover art (known as the 'Screaming Elf') is a {{distorted}} {{photograph of the}} band members, photographed by Kevin Westenberg, above {{a black and white}} upside-down burning forest. Concerning the artwork, Cornell said, [...] "Superunknown relates to birth in a way... Being born or even dying—getting flushed into something that you know nothing about. The hardest thing is to nail down a visual image to put on a title like that. The first thing <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> was a forest in grey or black. Soundgarden has always been associated with images of flowers and lush colors and this was the opposite. It still seemed organic but it was very dark and cold... I was into those stories as a kid where forests were full of evil and scary things as opposed to being happy gardens that you go camping in." [...] In a 1994 Pulse! magazine interview, Cornell said that the inspiration for the album's title came from his misreading of a video entitled Superclown. He added, [...] "I thought it was a cool title. I'd never heard it before, never saw it before, and it inspired me." [...] The album also saw a limited release on 12" [...] colored vinyl (blue, orange, and clear), as a double-LP in a gatefold sleeve. The album's title 'SUPERUNKNOWN' is sometimes displayed with the [...] "UNKNOWN" [...] as semi upside down and reversed lettering (stylized as [...] "SUPER∩ИKИOWИ").|$|E
2500|$|Project leader Colonel S. and {{his team}} in the Administration for the Development of Weapons and Technological Infrastructure (Maf'at) had very little spare time, and only on the {{weekends}} could they think of an appropriate name for the system. According to Colonel S., [...] "The first name I thought of was 'Anti-Qassam', but when the project started to move forward I realized it was problematic... I sat down with my wife, and together <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> suitable names. She suggested the name 'Tamir' (Hebrew acronym for טיל מיירט, Til Meyaret, 'interceptor missile') for the missile, and for the system itself <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> 'Golden Dome'. The following Sunday, 'Tamir' was immediately approved, {{but there was a}} problem with 'Golden Dome'—it could be perceived as ostentatious. So it was changed to 'Iron Dome'." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{proposition}} was cordially received, but {{the difficulty}} {{appeared to be}} that here was a long story written before <b>we</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> it.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But why, my dear? How {{are you to}} do better? Perhaps I, or your aunt, {{should have}} spoken to you first, and told you that <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> well <b>of</b> the match.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Very well,' he said. 'I {{really think}} it is a good idea. There are great {{opportunities}} open to a barrister. I wish <b>we</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> it before.' ...|$|R
2500|$|After The Adventures of Fartman was shelved, Buchwald {{started to}} pitch deals with book {{publishers}} as [...] "there was {{a perception that}} [...] had taken a hit ... <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> the book as something that would both produce income and suggest to people that Howard had economic clout". In early 1993, Stern signed a deal with Simon & Schuster worth around $1million to write his first book, Private Parts. He spent the summer writing it with collaborator Larry [...] "Ratso" [...] Sloman and editor Judith Regan, calling the experience [...] "the most challenging thing I have ever done in my career". Upon its release on October 7, 1993, Private Parts was an immediate commercial success. The entire first print of 225,000 copies were sold within hours of going on sale. In five days, it became the fastest selling title {{in the history of}} Simon & Schuster. Over one million copies were distributed after two weeks. Private Parts entered The New York Times Best-Seller list at number one and stayed on the list for 20 weeks. Stern held book signings across the country with sessions lasting as long as seven hours. The first, held in New York City, was attended by an estimated ten thousand people.|$|E
2500|$|Anberlin lead vocalist Stephen Christian {{has stated}} {{different}} {{origins of the}} band's name in various interviews, prevalent among which was his claim that he had long intended to name his first daughter Anberlin. Struggling to find {{a name for the}} band, Stephen suggested it; [...] "We were all sitting around {{trying to come up with}} a name. None of us were married or had kids, but one day I was going to name my daughter Anberlin, so I figured we could name the band that until <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> something better. So we chose Anberlin and no one has thought of anything better." [...] He stated he was no longer going to use Anberlin to name his first daughter, however he said, [...] "If I ever have a daughter and name her Anberlin, she'll think she was named after the band instead of the other way around." [...] Christian had also stated in another interview that the band's name was created when he was thinking about cities in Europe he wanted to visit. In his mind he listed [...] "London, Paris, Rome, and Berlin." [...] Christian thought that [...] "and Berlin" [...] would be an appropriate name for a band, and so when the band was looking for a name Christian suggested [...] "And Berlin," [...] which was then modified to [...] "Anberlin." ...|$|E
