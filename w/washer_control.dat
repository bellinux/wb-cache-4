The {{fuzzy control}} is an {{intelligent}} control method relying upon the fuzzy set theory, fuzzy variables, and logic deduction. It can imitate {{the process of}} human decision inference in behavior, so it is more consistent with the fuzziness and human awareness, understanding, decision of objective thing. This paper selects the washing machine as the control object, bases on the <b>washer</b> <b>control</b> principle, introduces the fuzzy decision process, especially studies the fuzzy control theory with three inputs and two outputs and sets up the fuzzy rules, at last, gives the fuzzy decision of the control {{and the results of}} simulation. ? 2011 IEEE...|$|E
2500|$|The 1984 {{model year}} saw {{the return of}} the two-door sport coupe making a three model line-up. Styling {{remained}} unchanged. 1984 models were virtually identical to 1981 models. The windshield <b>washer</b> <b>controls</b> were moved from the dashboard to the turn signal stalk to create the multi-stalk. The optional cruise control (which continued to be mounted on the turn signal stalk) now featured acceleration/deceleration in [...] increments. An optional Landau package included a vinyl roof, sport mirrors and reveal moldings.|$|R
5000|$|The Charger was now {{marketed as}} the Chrysler Charger {{rather than as}} the Chrysler Valiant Charger [...] with Chrysler script badging having {{replaced}} Valiant badging front and rear. Some further changes with the VK model included 'white-out' grille treatment, revised rear light clusters, and revised 'C' pillar ornamentation utilising extended fibreglass panels in black, incorporating XL or 770 badge identification. Inside, wiper and windscreen <b>washer</b> <b>controls</b> were now integrated into the indicator stalk and there were also some trim revisions that included bold Boca-Raton cloth seat inserts for the Charger 770.|$|R

50|$|Starting in the 1986 model year, the Grand Wagoneer {{received}} a new four part front grille and a stand-up hood ornament. An updated audio system became a standard feature and a power sunroof installed by American Sunroof Corporation, became a factory option. However, {{the most significant}} change was the installation of a fully revamped interior including a new dashpad, new instrumentation, new door panel design, shorter nap cut-pile carpeting, new leather seat cover designs and front seats that now featured adjustable headrests. Changes {{were made to the}} instrument panel that now featured square gauges, featured woodgrain overlays and contained an improved climate control system. A new two spoke steering wheel also included new stalks for the lights and wiper and <b>washer</b> <b>controls</b> on the column. The Select-Trac driveline gained a new Trac-Lok limited slip differential to send power to the wheel with the best traction. There were 17,254 Grand Wagoneers built in 1986.|$|R

40|$|In this study, an {{experimental}} investigation {{on the effects}} of grooves on thrust washer bearings is investigated. Eight equally sized grooves are machined about 100 µm deep into one side of a flat-faced steel washer. This thrust washer bearing is lo-cated between a helical gear and its carrier and is tested on a test rig capable of measuring frictional torque and the temperature of the bearing at different speeds. It is found that the grooved washers had lower bearing temperatures and failed at signifi-cantly higher loads than the <b>control</b> <b>washer</b> with no grooves. For a test procedure with varying operating conditions, the co-efficient of friction is also significantly lower for the grooved washers. However, the grooved washers had about the same co-efficient of friction as the <b>control</b> <b>washers</b> at each step when the speeds are very high. The results from various tests sug-gest that the increased amount of lubricant passing through the grooved surface of the washer removes heat from the washer bearing by convection. This decrease in stored heat conducted from friction deters thermoelastic instabilities and the reduction of hydrodynamic stiffness due to the decrease in viscosity. En-hanced hydrodynamic load-carrying capacity is also evident in the grooved washers test results...|$|R
50|$|The G-Wagen was facelifted in 1990. In 1989, for the 10th {{anniversary of}} the G Model, a new model variant with {{permanent}} 4-wheel drive, a wood-trimmed interior and optional Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) debuted at the Frankfurt International Motor Show. Production began the following April. For 1992, a new sub-series for professional users began production. The civilian model began to offer cruise control, a stainless-steel spare-tire cover, running boards and Burl Walnut wood interior trim. The same year, the 100,000th G Model was built in Graz. In 1994, the model line was officially renamed the G-Class. Ventilated front disc brakes and a driver’s air bag became standard. In 1996 the automatic transmission became an electronically controlled 5-speed unit. Headlamp <b>washers,</b> cruise <b>control</b> and a front passenger’s air bag were added. In 1998, the range-topping G 500 with a 296 hp V 8 was introduced for series production.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to study the {{behaviour}} {{of the connection between}} the guardrail and post in a steel road safety barrier subject to tensile, shear and combined loading conditions. This is accomplished by performing laboratory tests on a special-built test rig. Finite element models of the connection are created and validated in order to form a basis for large scale numerical simulations of road safety barriers. The laboratory tests all failed by thread stripping of the bolt in the connection. The ultimate failure load decreased by 15. 9 and 17. 3 percent when loading in 15 and 30 from pure tension respectively. A two-step finite element model was created to simulate the behaviour of the threaded bolt and nut assembly in question. The relative displacement between the bolt and the nut in an initial model of the guard rail and post with an unthreaded connection was enforced on a separate model of the bolt and nut with threads. A full model including the threaded connection was created and compared to the two-step model. The results indicate that the behaviour prior to failure is controlled by deformations in the guardrail, post and <b>washers.</b> Failure is <b>controlled</b> by the threaded bolt, and the ultimate load is highly dependent on the bolt material. It is possible to model the bolted connection, subject to combined tension and shear loading conditions, with an acceptable degree of accuracy. A consistent failure mode can be achieved with both the two-step model and the full model. The ultimate loads experienced in the two-step model were in close proximity to the experimental results in some load combinations. The full model was close to the laboratory results in most load combinations, where the deviation from the average failure load in pure tension was 1. 1 - 2. 7 percent. </p...|$|R
40|$|D. Ing. (Engineering Management) Abstract: When the {{complexity}} of the controller plant is a non-linear system, the production process cannot be fulfilled by the control effect and {{it is not easy to}} manipulate the parameters on Proportional-Integral-Derivative Controller. The major objective under study is simulating and modelling machinery then come up with a suitable intelligent Condition Based Maintenance system (i. e to develop a suitable intelligent system using fuzzy logic and artificial intelligence). The area under study of Fuzzy Logic came as a concern of nonlinear systems which fail to give correct information since machines use conventional Proportional-Integral-Derivative and hence this is for linear systems. Considering vibrations and continuous failure of machines, this will cause incorrect data portraying. Three companies were done in this thesis and all were analysed using fuzzy logic and some finite element analysis of components to monitor the parameters. Root cause analysis was also done to determine what was failing on different equipments. Three companies in a developing country were used as case studies for testing fuzzy logic approaches and models to machinery failure analysis. The three companies are designated as follows: Beverages Production Company, Hydro Power Generating Company and Water Distributing Company. The overall effectiveness of the companies were heavily affected due to many breakdowns. The main problem was found to be resulting from failure to monitor nonlinear systems that naturally exist in such environments. On the bottle washer at Beverages Production Company, fuzzy logic with Model Reference Adaptive Control to prevent failure on the bottle washer and introduce an intelligent Condition Based Maintenance program was done, a solution to come up with a control system that monitors water in the dam as well as protecting the equipment from failure and do stability control of machinery for Water Distributing Company as well as apply the concept of Maintenance Free Operating Period reliability metric to determine maintenance intervals as opposed to Mean Time Between Failure to the Hydro-Power Generation Company and also do a Simulink control on the governor. The results of the simulation of the control strategy of Fuzzy Logic Proportional-Integral-Derivative Controller have much preferred performance as compared to the general Proportional-Integral-Derivative Controller. This was done in the Simulink/Matlab simulation environment. The innovations behind this thesis at Beverages Production Company, the pneumatic valve of the bottle <b>washer</b> which <b>controls</b> the discharge of clean bottles was occasionally sticking or failing resulting in significant loss of production in the plant since all the other processes which follow depend on the bottle washer. The main causes of failure were caused by poor control of temperature and pressure. Excessive moisture and abrasive particles also caused failures. In order to solve this problem a Model Reference Adaptive Fuzzy Controller was designed for the pneumatic valve using the Matlab software. The error resulting from the difference between the actual system output and that of the reference model was executed by the Fuzzy Logic Controller. At company Hydro-Power Generation Company, the administering system of a 150 Megawatts Francis Turbine was developed using fuzzy logic. The representative framework parameters were mirrored with the real information accessible in the power plant. At Water Distributing Company the problem of corroding gates and failure was solved using solid works, Matlab, Programmable Logic Controller and Simulink. The sluice gate valve was controlled and done stability by Matlab to avoid failure. After fuzzy logic is applied in each and every company under study, the breakdowns will be less and machinery can be diagnosed and prognosis is easy to foresee the failures. A new gate was designed by the researcher. The research has shown that fuzzy logic being intelligent, machinery can last longer and production is high. The limitations are that although it is good in monitoring but in some machinery and companies may not work well because of environment like in the water gates. It is also expensive to implement and difficult to convince management to do the research for a start...|$|R
