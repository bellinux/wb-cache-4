30|$|Very recently, {{simultaneous}} <b>wireless</b> {{information and}} <b>power</b> <b>transfer</b> (SWIPT) {{has been an}} exciting new way to provide stale energy to wireless communication where the receiver is able to harvest energy and decode information from the received signals [5 – 11]. In [5], the authors described the basic idea about the <b>wireless</b> information and <b>power</b> <b>transfer</b> from information theoretical perspective, and in [6], the authors proposed a general receiver architecture with separated information decoding and energy harvesting receiver for SWIPT for practical applications.|$|R
40|$|Radio-frequency (RF) signals enabled <b>wireless</b> {{information}} and <b>power</b> <b>transfer</b> (WIPT) is a cost-effective technique to achieve two-way communications {{and at the}} same time provide energy supplies for low-power wireless devices. However, the information transmission in WIPT is vulnerable to the eavesdropping by the energy receivers (ERs). To achieve secrecy communications with information nodes (INs) while satisfying the energy transfer requirement of ERs, an efficient solution is to exploit a dual use of the energy signals also as useful interference or artificial noise (AN) to interfere with the ERs, thus preventing against their potential information eavesdropping. Towards this end, this article provides an overview on the joint design of energy and information signals to achieve energy-efficient and secure WIPT under various practical setups, including simultaneous <b>wireless</b> {{information and}} <b>power</b> <b>transfer</b> (SWIPT), <b>wireless</b> <b>powered</b> cooperative relaying and jamming, and <b>wireless</b> <b>powered</b> communication networks (WPCN).

The power transmission frequency is 6.78 MHz, and up to eight devices can be powered from a single PTU depending on transmitter and receiver geometry and power levels.

2500|$|Nikola Tesla first {{discovered}} resonant coupling during his pioneering experiments in <b>wireless</b> <b>power</b> <b>transfer</b> {{around the turn}} of the 20th century, [...] but the possibilities of using resonant coupling to increase transmission range has only recently been explored. [...] In 2007 a team led by Marin Soljačić at MIT used two coupled tuned circuits each made of a 25cm self-resonant coil of wire at 10MHz to achieve the transmission of 60 W of power over a distance of [...] (8 times the coil diameter) at around 40% efficiency.|$|E
2500|$|A {{drawback}} of resonant coupling {{theory is}} that at close ranges when the two resonant circuits are tightly coupled, the resonant frequency {{of the system is}} no longer constant but [...] "splits" [...] into two resonant peaks, so the maximum power transfer no longer occurs at the original resonant frequency and the oscillator frequency must be tuned to the new resonance peak. The case of using such a shifted peak is called [...] "Single resonant". The [...] "Single resonant" [...] systems have also been used, in which only the secondary is a tuned circuit. The principle of this phenomenon is also called [...] "(Magnetic) phase synchronization" [...] and already started practical application for AGV in Japan from around 1993. And now, the concept of Highly Resonant presented by MIT is applied only to the secondary side resonator, and high efficiency wide gap high power <b>wireless</b> <b>power</b> <b>transfer</b> system is realized and it is used for induction current collector of SCMaglev.|$|E
2500|$|The 19th century {{saw many}} {{developments}} of theories, and counter-theories on how electrical energy might be transmitted. In 1826 André-Marie Ampère found Ampère's circuital law showing that electric current produces a magnetic field. [...] Michael Faraday described in 1831 with his law of induction the electromotive force driving a current in a conductor loop by a time-varying magnetic flux. The fact that electrical energy could by transmitted {{at a distance}} without wires was actually observed by many inventors and experimenters, but lack of a coherent theory attributed these phenomena vaguely to electromagnetic induction. A concise explanation of these phenomena would come from the 1860s Maxwell's equations by James Clerk Maxwell, establishing a theory that unified electricity and magnetism to electromagnetism, predicting the existence of electromagnetic waves as the [...] "wireless" [...] carrier of electromagnetic energy. Around 1884 John Henry Poynting defined the Poynting vector and gave Poynting's theorem, which describe the flow of power across an area within electromagnetic radiation and allow for a correct analysis of <b>wireless</b> <b>power</b> <b>transfer</b> systems. This was followed on by Heinrich Rudolf Hertz' 1888 validation of the theory, which included the evidence for radio waves.|$|E

By embedding information into energy patterns rather than imposing it by modulating classic radio waveforms, our proposed solution is capable of operating both in an integrated receiver mode and in a power-split mode, while relying on a low-complexity two-stage non-coherent detection algorithm. Both our analysis and simulations show that our energy pattern aided SWIPT system exhibits a beneficial immunity to any potential performance degradation imposed by power-conversion.

In recent years, {{there has been a}} great deal of interest in in-motion vehicle charging. The dominant technology thus far for in motion charging is elongated tracks, creating a constant eld for the moving vehicle. This technology suers from high volt ampere ratings and lower efficiency of 70 %. On the other hand, stationary charging systems can demonstrate efficiency up to 95 %. This thesis proposes lumped coils, similar to stationary charging coils for in-motion electric vehicle charging application.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{consider}} an underlay cognitive radio (CR) networks with one primary receiver, one cognitive transmitter-receiver pair, and one energy harvesting relay. The transmission {{power of the}} secondary source is determined op-portunistically by its interference to the primary receiver, and the relay transmission is powered by the energy harvested from the radio frequency observations at the relay. For the considered CR networks with simultaneous <b>wireless</b> information and <b>power</b> <b>transfer</b> (SWIPT), we derive analytical expressions for the outage probability, {{as well as their}} high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) approximations in closed-form. The developed analytical results demonstrate that the use of SWIPT will not cause any loss of diversity gain, but the outage probability achieved by the SWIPT-CR scheme asymptotically decays as log SNR SNR, whereas a decaying rate of 1 SNR is achieved by a conventional CR network.

40|$|Abstract — Designers of on-body health sensing devices face a {{difficult}} choice. They must either minimise the power consumption of devices, which in reality means reducing the sensing capabilities, or build devices that require regular battery changes or recharging. Both options limit {{the effectiveness of}} devices. Here we investigate an alternative. This paper presents a method of designing safe, <b>wireless,</b> inductive <b>power</b> <b>transfer</b> into on-body sensor products. This approach can produce sensing devices that can be worn for longer durations {{without the need for}} human intervention, whilst also having greater sensing and data capture capabilities. The paper addresses significant challenges in achieving this aim, in particular: device safety, sufficient <b>power</b> <b>transfer,</b> and human factors regarding device geometry. We show how to develop a device that meets stringent international safety guidelines for electromagnetic energy on the body and describe a design space that allows designers to make trade-offs that balance <b>power</b> <b>transfer</b> with other constraints, e. g. size and bulk, that affect the wearability of devices. Finally we describe a rapid experimental method to investigate the optimal placement of on-body devices and the actual versus theoretical <b>power</b> <b>transfer</b> for on-body, inductively powered devices.
