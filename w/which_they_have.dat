Emigration is positively and decidedly setting that way; but as yet it is mere worldly emigration, with the hope of making money, nothing more.|$|E
5|$|Even by Sammarinese standards, {{qualification}} for the 1998 World Cup was disappointing. Losing {{every game}} by three goals or more, San Marino failed {{to score a}} single goal. This is the only World Cup qualifying tournament in <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> failed to score. Qualification for Euro 2000 again resulted in defeats in every game. The closest game was against Cyprus, a 1–0 defeat on 18 November 1998.|$|E

60|$|Sophia {{first tried}} to appease them and reduce them to order by conciliatory measures.

She added that, now, since the end <b>which</b> <b>they</b> all <b>had</b> in view in the movement <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> made had been entirely and happily accomplished, the soldiers should be restrained from any farther violence, and recalled to their quarters.|$|R

5|$|Dinoflagellates may use {{bioluminescence}} for defence against predators. They shine {{when they}} detect a predator, possibly making the predator itself more vulnerable by attracting {{the attention of}} predators from higher trophic levels. Grazing copepods release any phytoplankton cells that flash, unharmed; if they were eaten they would make the copepods glow, attracting predators, so the phytoplankton's bioluminescence is defensive. The problem of shining stomach contents is solved (and the explanation corroborated) in predatory deep-sea fishes: their stomachs have a black lining {{able to keep the}} light from any bioluminescent fish prey <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> swallowed from attracting larger predators.|$|E
