40|$|This project {{explores the}} testing {{procedures}} {{in which the}} <b>anechoic</b> <b>chamber,</b> located on level 2 of the Faculty of Engineering and Surveying building at the University of Southern Queensland, can be characterised {{in the way of}} its performance regarding electromagnetic compatibilities. This characterisation will help further users of the <b>anechoic</b> <b>chamber</b> better understand the results in which are obtained within the chamber as well as know the interference that could be caused by the leakage of signals coming from the chamber. The performance characteristics that will be looked at are first of all the ability <b>for</b> the <b>anechoic</b> <b>chamber</b> to keep environmental noise from entering the chamber walls, creating false measurements, preventing harmful signals escaping and interfering with other commercial bandwidths. Then the pyramidal absorbers themselves will be analysed and their capability of attenuating a wide range of frequencies over a set number of angles of incidences will be recorded. This {{is the first step in}} a bigger task of being able to explain the patterns of variation in the electromagnetic field in a two dimensional plane. The way in which the performance of the pyramidal absorbers varies with angle helps explain this, as it gives the magnitude of absorption when a wave is reflected off the wall and interferes with the direct path, This process of following the different paths around the enclosed area is called ray tracing which is touched on in this project, but due to time constraints only the theory of the technique is recalled. From the results that were obtained, the <b>anechoic</b> <b>chamber</b> can now be utilised as to get a more accurate measurement by being able to configure the testing specifications to suit the chambers performance strengths and weaknesses.

40|$|Abstract—Building an <b>anechoic</b> <b>chamber</b> {{involves}} a substantial investment both financially and in physical space. Hence, {{there is much}} interest in trying to reduce the required investment while still maintaining adequate performance. The performance of an <b>anechoic</b> <b>chamber</b> depends on the type, size, and array configuration of the absorber elements {{as well as the}} geometry of the screened room on which the inner surfaces are covered with RF absorbers. If the room geometry is designed such that an electromagnetic ray from the transmitter will only reach the receiver antenna after a few reflections, the wave energy may be sufficiently damped after a few bounces off the absorbing walls and ceiling.

40|$|ElectroMagnetic Compatibility (E. M. C.) measuements, {{that today}} {{becomes more and}} more important, {{requires}} materials having high attenuation level, typically - 20 dB from 30 MHz to 20 GHz. Because of their low frequency range absorption, ferrite are only efficient up to 1 GHz. The use of dispersion techniques for development of granular materials as microwave absorbers is a convenient way to make coatings with good attenuation characteristics in the 1 - 20 GHz range. Especially, elastomer mixing is a very good technique for dispersion and individualization of each grain of ferromagnetic powder (iron, cobalt, permalloy, [...] .) or ferrimagnetic powder up to 60 % (volume) while maintaining electrical insulation [1]. Such materials are easy to process by classical processing polymer techniques and can be processed in various shapes. It has already been shown that combination of magnetic material properties and geometrical effect by molding under the form of conical or pyramidal shapes significantly broadens the absorber frequency range working [2]. These absorbers with conical or pyramidal pattern, are very efficient above 1 GHz due to creation of a geometrical gradient. The realization of an architecture by combining a ferrite tile with a conical shaped ferrimagnetic granular material leads to very braodband absorbers suitable for E. M. C. applications.

40|$|We {{describe}} here {{a simple}} process for calibrating a transient scattering range. The process uses a paraboloidal scatterer to transform an axially {{incident plane wave}} into a spherical wave. Since {{the magnitude of the}} scattered field is known analytically, one can simply calibrate a meas-urement system. In order to calculate the scattered field, we use a stereographic projection that has previously been called the reflector transform. This technique provides three advantages over traditional calibration with a sphere. First, it is potentially more accurate, since the scattering characteristics of a paraboloid are independent of frequency. There is no need to convert the measured time domain data to the frequency do-main in order to deconvolve the characteristics of the scattere ~ the entire process takes place in the time domain.

The AC {{has been developed}} for many years, while {{in the past few}} years RC has emerged as a promising facility not just in electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) measurements but also as a multi-disciplinary research facility in various areas. <b>For</b> the <b>anechoic</b> <b>chamber,</b> a CAD tool is developed to aid the design of an <b>anechoic</b> <b>chamber.</b> The objective is to estimate the chamber performance accurately. The ultimate goal is to minimise the cost but optimise the chamber performance for given conditions and specifications. This is very important for a commercial company. The CAD tool is developed based on the GO theory, two different algorithms are realised, acceleration techniques are applied, and measurements are performed to validate the CAD tool. For the reverberation chamber, a series of new measurement methods in the RC are developed including antenna radiation efficiency measurement, diversity gain measurement, radiated emission measurement, material characterisation, shielding effectiveness, volume measurement, etc. Finally, we apply the B-scan in an RC to characterise the behaviour of the electric field in the time domain. Statistical characterisation of the electric field in the time domain is given, stirrer efficiency is quantified based on the total scattering cross section (TSCS) of stirrers, and time gating technique in the RC is introduced.

40|$|Introduction: The {{previous}} studies have used fibrous absorbents usually {{in the form of}} cone-shaped <b>wedges</b> <b>for</b> making <b>anechoic</b> and semi-anechoic <b>chambers</b> which their design and construction have been costly and difficult. The present study aimed to design a semi-anechoic chamber, using rectangular fibrous absorbents and also perform acoustic analysis for it.. Material and Method: In the present study, which was done at semi-anechoic chamber of the laboratory in Tehran University of Medical Sciences. The reverberation time, the total surface and the absorption surface of the chamber were determined, before and after the design and also they were compared with the target values. Intersection layout of the rectangular fibrous absorbents were design using graphic design software (AutoCAD and 3 Ds Max). before design, the reverberation time were measured according to ISO 3382 : 2000. The reverberation time in redesigned chamber was also calculated through retention time equation (Sabine). Moreover, Sabin’s formula was applied for determining the absorption surface and the total surface of the chamber, before and after the design.. Result: Before design, the reverberation time in the cut-off frequency of 250 Hz according to ISO 3382 : 2000 was determined 0. 3 second. Moreover, the total chamber surface was 47. 97 m 2. CAD software estimated at least 253 rectangular absorbents with dimensions of 50 × 18 cm. After design, the absorption surface and the total chamber surface were obtained 46. 32 m 2 and 92. 64 m 2, respectively and the reverberation time in the mentioned frequency was 0. 07 (s)..

40|$|This report {{presents}} the measurement {{result of a}} passive horn antenna gain by only using metallic reflector and vector network analyzer, according to image theory. This method is an alternative way to conventional methods such as the three antennas method and the two antennas method. The gain values are calculated using a simple formula using {{the distance between the}} antenna and reflector, operating frequency, S-parameter and speed of light. The antenna is directed towards an absorber and then directed towards the reflector to obtain the S 11 parameter using the vector network analyzer. The experiments are performed in three locations which are in the shielding room, <b>anechoic</b> <b>chamber</b> and open space with distances of 0. 5 m, 1 m, 2 m, 3 m and 4 m. The results calculated are compared and analyzed with the manufacture’s data.

This proves that the single antenna method using image theory needs less space, time and cost to perform it. The method used can be improved by considering the uncertain elements such as losses, reflections sources, optimize far filed distance and reflector size required in calculating the gain...|$|R
40|$|Natural {{structures}} exhibiting simultaneous negative bulk permittivity and permeability {{have not}} yet been discovered. However, research interest {{over the past five years}} has grown with the proposition that artificial structures exhibiting these properties are realizable using specially-designed metallic inclusions embedded in host dielectric bodies. A periodic structure of metallic inclusions much smaller than the guided wavelength and embedded in a host dielectric medium is known in the physics and microwave communities as a 2 ̆ 2 metamaterial 2 ̆ 2. Such frequency-dependent effectively homogeneous materials may be designed to exhibit negative permeability and permittivity at certain frequencies. As predicted by electromagnetic theory, such negative index or 2 ̆ 2 left-handed 2 ̆ 2 metamaterials are shown to have unique filtering properties and exhibit negative refraction and 2 ̆ 2 backward wave 2 ̆ 2 propagation. The 2 ̆ 2 backward wave 2 ̆ 2 phenomenon describes the anti-parallel nature of phase velocity and group velocity in a negative index metamaterial and can be additionally characterized in vector theory using the left hand rule. Additionally, 2 ̆ 2 epsilon-near zero 2 ̆ 2 (ENZ) metamaterials are characterized by a bulk permittivity equal to zero. Applications include focusing radiation emitted by small apertures. This thesis provides the theory for metamaterial structures supported by simulations conducted with the commercial finite element method solver: Ansoft HFSS. Metallic inclusions such as the split ring resonator structure (SRR), S-shaped split ring resonator (SSRR), wire rod and capacitively loaded strip (CLS) are presented analytically and simulated in HFSS. Metamaterial structures designed to exhibit left-handed behavior in the X-band frequency region are simulated for frequency-dependent transmission, reflection and refractive properties. A test configuration for measuring a metamaterial slab 2 ̆ 7 s match to free space is proposed and constructed. Additionally a prism design and test plan geared <b>for</b> <b>anechoic</b> <b>chamber</b> testing and refraction measurement is proposed and built. Simulated inclusions are fabricated on FR- 4 epoxy laminate boards, combined to form metamaterial structures, and tested in the Cal Poly <b>Anechoic</b> <b>chamber.</b> Results show that transmission properties match closely with HFSS simulations. Prism metamaterial testing shows that negative refraction is visible in the 8 to 9 GHz region. A modified form of the Nicolson Ross-Weir method for parameter extraction using S-parameter data is shown to provide an initial approximation for the permeability and permittivity of the structure under test. Finally, both negative and zero-index metamaterials are analyzed in HFSS simulations to improve the directivity of EM radiation from sub-wavelength apertures. Epsilon-near zero metamaterials placed on sub-wavelength apertures are shown to improve directivity by two fold in the far-field at design frequencies...|$|R
50|$|Electro-acoustic {{devices such}} as {{loudspeakers}} and microphones present special problems for analysis, as they must receive or transmit signals through air. In these cases, the DUT in the model shown above must be replaced with the complete electro-mechanical system, e.g., a power amplifier to drive a loudspeaker, a loudspeaker, a measurement microphone and microphone pre-amplifier. The actual device under test can be measured only when the other devices in this system are fully characterized, so that the contributions from these devices may be subtracted from the response. Many modern audio analyzers contain measurement sequences that automate this procedure, and the focus of recent developments has been on quasi-anechoic measurements. These techniques allow loudspeakers to be characterised in a non-ideal (noisy) environment, without the need <b>for</b> an <b>anechoic</b> <b>chamber,</b> which makes them ideally suited for use in high volume production line manufacturing. Most quasi-anechoic measurements are based around an impulse response created from a sine wave whose frequency is swept on a logarithmic scale, with a window function applied to remove any acoustic reflections. The log swept sine method increases signal-to-noise ratio and also allows measurement of individual distortion harmonics up to the Nyquist frequency, something which previously impossible with older analysis techniques such as MLS (Maximum Length Sequence).|$|R
