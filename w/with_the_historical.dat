5|$|A {{more mundane}} {{example is the}} {{presence}} of astrological symbols found on some shoes and sandals from the Roman Empire. The use of shoes and sandals is well known, but Carol van Driel-Murray has proposed that astrological symbols etched onto sandals gave the footwear spiritual or medicinal meanings. This is supported through citation of other known uses of astrological symbols and their connection to medical practice and <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> records of the time.|$|E

5|$|Based {{on their}} {{similarity}} to the Altar of the City Patrons, art historians have attributed other paintings to Lochner, although a number have {{questioned whether the}} diary entry was authentically made by Dürer. Documentary evidence linking the paintings and miniatures <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> Lochner has also been challenged, most notably by the art historian Michael Wolfson in 1996. In either case, the extent of Lochner's direct hand, {{as opposed to those}} of workshop members or followers, is debated. Some panels formerly attributed to him are now thought to date from after 1451, the year of his death.|$|E
5|$|Less {{is known}} of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> Stefan Lochner believe {{he was born in}} Meersburg in {{south-west}} Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major city occasion. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40.|$|E
5|$|The Greek {{text on the}} Rosetta Stone {{provided}} the starting point. Ancient Greek was widely known to scholars, {{but they were not}} familiar with details of its use in the Hellenistic period as a government language in Ptolemaic Egypt; large-scale discoveries of Greek papyri were a long way in the future. Thus, the earliest translations of the Greek text of the stone show the translators still struggling <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> context and with administrative and religious jargon. Stephen Weston verbally presented an English translation of the Greek text at a Society of Antiquaries meeting in April 1802.|$|E

5|$|The {{authorities}} had initially {{planned for the}} replica to replace the red Berlayer Beacon, but the Singapore Heritage Society was against the decision, saying the beacon was itself a heritage site {{and should not be}} destroyed because the beacon has been at Labrador Park since the end of World War II. The replica was finally built just meters away from the beacon.

5|$|There are {{different}} {{accounts of the}} rise of Darius to the throne from both Darius himself and Greek historians. The oldest records report a convoluted sequence of events in which Cambyses II lost his mind, murdered his brother Bardiya, and was killed by an infected leg wound. After this, Darius and a group of six nobles traveled to Sikayauvati to kill an usurper, Gaumata, who had taken the throne by pretending to be Bardiya during the true king's absence. Many modern historians believe that Gaumata, in fact, was the true heir Bardiya, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> account being altered by Darius to make the coup d'etat appear more legitimate.|$|E
5|$|Legislation {{defines the}} {{appearance}} {{and use of}} the Presidential Standard of Croatia {{as a symbol of the}} President of Croatia, and the appearance {{and use of the}} presidential sash as a symbol of honour of the office of the president. The presidential standard is a square, blue field with a thin border of alternating red and white squares on each side. In the centre of the blue field is the main shield of the coat of arms of Croatia <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> arms of Croatia surrounding the main shield. From left to right, these are the oldest known coats of arms of Croatia, the Republic of Dubrovnik, Dalmatia, Istria and Slavonia, adorned with bands of gold, red and white stripes extending down vertically. Atop the shield there is a Croatian tricolour ribbon with golden letters RH that stand for the Republic of Croatia, executed in Roman square capitals. The presidential standard is flown on buildings of the Office of the President of Croatia, the residence of the president, transportation vehicles when in use by the president, and in other ceremonial occasions. The presidential standard was designed by Miroslav Šutej in 1990.|$|E

5|$|The legendary saga Yngvars saga víðförla {{describes}} the last expedition of the Vikings into the Caspian, dated to 1041 and possibly {{connected with the}} Georgian-Byzantine Battle of Sasireti in which a Varangian force participated around the same time; in the saga much legend is conflated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> facts. This expedition was launched from Sweden by Ingvar the Far-Travelled, who went down the Volga into {{the land of the}} Saracens (Serkland in Norse). There are no less than twenty-six Ingvar Runestones, twenty-three of them being in the Lake Mälaren region of Uppland in Sweden, referring to Swedish warriors who went out with Ingvar on his expedition to the Saracen lands, an expedition whose purpose was probably to reopen old trade routes, now that the Bulgars and the Khazars no longer proved obstacles. A stone to Ingvar's brother indicates that he went east for gold but that he died in the Saracen land. Afterwards, no attempts were made by the Norsemen to reopen the route between the Baltic and Caspian seas.|$|E
5|$|The work is {{traditionally}} {{divided into three}} books. Along with the history in Book I the first section also contains a prologue and a preface. It discusses {{the founding of the}} Abbey of Ely and the background of the foundress, Æthelthryth. The first book also deals with the history of the abbey and its abbesses until the Danish invasions of the 9th century. A description of the destruction of the abbey by the Danes and of King Edgar's (reigned 959–975) rule concludes the book. The second book, Book II, begins with the restoration of the abbey during Edgar's reign, under Bishop Æthelwold. Accounts of the subsequent abbots until the last, Richard, are included in Book II, as well as numerous charters and other documents. The final book, Book III, contains information on the conversion of the abbey to a bishopric, and on the first few bishops; it concludes with a description of the martyrdom of Thomas Becket. Interspersed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> narrative are a number of documents and charters relating to the bishops.|$|E
5|$|<b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> name Mirfak (Arabic for elbow) or Algenib, Alpha Persei is the {{brightest}} star of this constellation with an apparent magnitude of 1.79. A supergiant of spectral type F5Ib located around 590 light-years away from Earth, Mirfak has 5,000 times the luminosity and 42 times the diameter of our Sun. It is {{the brightest}} member of the Alpha Persei Cluster (also known as Melotte 20 and Collinder 39), which is an open cluster containing many luminous stars. Neighboring bright stars that are members include the Be stars Delta (magnitude 3.0), Psi (4.3), and 48 Persei (4.0); the Beta Cephei variable Epsilon Persei (2.9); and the stars 29 (5.2), 30 (5.5), 31 (5.0), and 34 Persei (4.7). Of magnitude 4.05, nearby Iota Persei has been considered {{a member of the}} group, but is actually located a mere 34 light-years distant. This star is very similar to our Sun, shining with 2.2 times its luminosity. It is a yellow main sequence star of spectral type G0V. Extensive searches have failed to find evidence of it having a planetary system.|$|E
