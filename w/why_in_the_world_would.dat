Catholic boys are kind of vain. They think of themselves of being unique, so why would we want to be directed by a Jewish person?

5000|$|The {{song was}} covered by American country singer Reba McEntire on the {{television}} program Unplugged on Country Music Television. The cover {{was accompanied by a}} music video that premiered on June 18, 2010, which depicted McEntire performing the song live. In late 2010, she recorded a studio version, and it was added to country radio on January 24, 2011, by Starstruck Entertainment and Valory Music Group as the second single from her studio album All the Women I Am (2010). McEntire revealed that she originally wanted to only cover her own hits. However, her husband and manager, Narvel Blackstock wanted her to do a cover song. Blackstock finally {{came up with the idea}} that she should record her own version of Beyoncé's [...] "If I Were a Boy". Speaking about her version of the song, McEntire said:"When I got the song and the lyrics, I thought it was an incredible song ...

40|$|Within {{the general}} populace, {{there is the}} {{perception}} that even campaigns {{for state and local}} offices are so expensive that all candidates for such offices must be independently wealthy. This perception is clearly illustrated by the experience of Rev. Madison Shockley, a recent candidate for the Los Angeles City Council. As Shockley explains, 2 ̆ 2 My son went to elementary school each day, came back telling me 2 ̆ 7 dad, everyone thinks we 2 ̆ 7 re rich. 2 ̆ 7 I said, <b>why</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>would</b> they think that? 2 ̆ 7 Because you 2 ̆ 7 re running for office. 2 ̆ 7 There is this impression {{that you have to be}} personally wealthy to be involved in politics. and, surprising to me, that 2 ̆ 7 s not true. I 2 ̆ 7 m certainly not personally wealthy, but I was able to raise money from people who believed and shared in my cause in order to get the ball rolling in the political campaign. 2 ̆ 21 Although candidates for state and local offices do not have to be personally wealthy, it certainly costs a lot of money to a competitive campaign in a big city such as Los Angeles. The same is true for a state legislative race in California, where Assembly races can easily cost 500, 000 and Senate races might top 1 million. But these are exceptions, not the rule...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: When I {{began my}} {{research}} project roughly two and half years ago, I had one main goal in mind: {{to find out}} the reasoning behind Massachusetts mandating Elementary Education majors, like myself, to have a second major in the sciences or the humanities. My mind was consumed with the fact that I wanted to become an elementary school teacher, so <b>why</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>would</b> the state require me to have two complete undergraduate degrees when I would really only use my degree in education? This question is what sparked the whole idea of performing an interdisciplinary undergraduate research project. The purpose of my study was to become an expert on the initial interaction between Native Americans and English explorers in the New World during the 1600 s and then to apply my knowledgeable background of first encounters to selecting high quality children’s literature written from multiple perspectives to create a text set to be used in a fifth grade classroom. Throughout my research, the lines of separation between my two majors became blurred as I constantly crossed over critical and close reading techniques I had learned from both my Elementary Education and English majors, found opportunities to incorporate college level English texts into the elementary classroom, and discovered the importance of building a solid background on historical events prior to developing a text set {{to be used in the}} classroom. All of a sudden, my double major became a unified blend of equal parts Elementary Education and English. I could clearly see how an English degree fit into my future career as a classroom teacher. By the conclusion of my project, it had become less about the state requirement for education majors to have a second major in a content area and more about preparing myself to become the best possible educator...|$|E
