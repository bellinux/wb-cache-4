500|$|The main {{theme of}} obZen is [...] "human evil", {{according}} to Haake. The title is {{a play on}} the words [...] "obscene" [...] and [...] "Zen"; in addition, [...] "ob" [...] means [...] "anti" [...] in Latin. Therefore, the title suggests that the human species has found harmony and balance in warfare and bloodshed. Revolver Magazine finds the lyrics of the title track from obZen representative of the entire album: [...] "Salvation found in vomit and blood/Where depravation, lies, corruption/War and pain is god." [...] However, Haake claims, [...] "We don't dwell on hate and bad feelings as people. But with these songs, I think {{we really wanted to}} paint a picture lyrically that might be seen as a cautionary tale. We're going, 'Heads up. Here's <b>what</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parts of being human are about, {{and this is what we}} can be at our worst.' So it's more about being aware of negative feelings than actually living them all the time." ...|$|E
500|$|Hamilton {{accepted}} {{responsibility for}} his near stall on the grid: [...] "I hadn't hit the switch early enough and therefore we {{were not in the}} launch map and went straight into anti-stall, and when everyone else was in their launch mode, I wasn't." [...] Renault dismissed suggestions that Alonso had brake tested Hamilton in the incident that led to the McLaren's wing breaking off. Pat Symonds, Renault's head of engineering, said his team's telemetry indicated Alonso was on full throttle down the straight, and had not touched the brakes: [...] "I think all I can say from our side {{is that there is no}} blame attributable to Fernando, which is <b>what</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> speculation might be." [...] McLaren F1 CEO Martin Whitmarsh said that Hamilton's front wing had broken seconds before the impact, and that the resulting downforce reduction had sucked Hamilton into Alonso's slipstream faster than expected. However, photos indicate that the front wing on the McLaren could have broken even earlier when Hamilton nudged a car (believed to be Alonso) on the opening lap. The later incident left Alonso with damage to the back of the car, impairing his attempts to pass Glock late in the race.|$|E
500|$|The {{extent to}} which money or {{patronage}} affected {{the outcome of the}} election is unclear. Congressman Burton stated, [...] "I never saw any evidence of the use of money in Columbus and don't believe that any money was used corruptly." [...] In an interview after Hanna's death, James Rudolph Garfield, son of the late president and floor leader of the Hanna forces in the Ohio Senate, recalled that the senator [...] "had been asked to shut his eyes to some things. But he declined to do it." [...] However, Garfield also noted, [...] "I have never been sure as to <b>what</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> men who called themselves Senator Hanna's friends really did do." [...] Croly believed that Hanna did not personally authorize bribes of legislators, but concedes that Hanna's supporters [...] "may have been willing to spend money in Mr. Hanna's interest and without his knowledge." [...] The biographer suggested, [...] "If Mr. Hanna had himself planned to purchase the vote of John C. Otis, it is reasonable to believe that the business would have been better managed." [...] Horner believes it impossible to ascertain if corruption took place, but if Hanna bribed legislators, it was because it was a common practice on both sides. He notes of Hanna, [...] "his career as a senator continued, but accusations of wrongdoing remain a part of his legacy well over a century later." [...] Public dismay at what was seen as a corrupt means of choosing federal lawmakers was {{a major factor in the}} ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1913, which took the privilege of electing senators out of state legislators' hands and gave it to the people.|$|E

2500|$|The inner gallery {{is raised}} {{above ground level}} and has doubled corners, with the {{original}} redented cross-shape later filled out to a square. [...] Its bas-reliefs, later additions of Jayavarman VIII, are {{in stark contrast to}} those of the outer: rather than set-piece battles and processions, the smaller canvases offered by the inner gallery are decorated for the most part with scenes from Hindu mythology. Some of the figures depicted are Siva, Vishnu, and Brahma, the members of the trimurti or threefold godhead of Hinduism, Apsaras or celestial dancers, Ravana and Garuda. [...] There is however no certainty as to <b>what</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> panels depict, or as to their relationship with one another. [...] One gallery just north of the eastern gopura, for example, shows two linked scenes which have been explained as the freeing of a goddess from inside a mountain, or as an act of iconoclasm by Cham invaders. Another series of panels shows a king fighting a gigantic serpent with his bare hands, then having his hands examined by women, and finally lying ill in bed; these images have been connected with the legend of the Leper King, who contracted leprosy from the venom of a serpent with whom he had done battle. [...] Less obscure are depictions of the construction of a Vishnuite temple (south of the western gopura) and the Churning of the Sea of Milk (north of the western gopura).|$|E
2500|$|In the 2000s, {{the temple}} {{began to focus}} more on {{promoting}} an ethical lifestyle, using the five and eight precepts as a foundation. Nationwide people were encouraged to quit drinking and smoking through a campaign called The Lao Phao Buri ( [...] , literally: 'throw away alcohol and burn cigarettes'), cooperating with other religious traditions. This project led the World Health Organization (WHO) to present a World No Tobacco Day award to Luang Por Dhammajayo on 31 May 2004. Over two hundred The Lao Phao Buri ceremonies were held, involving literally the pouring away of alcoholic beverages and the burning of cigarettes. The ceremonies were later to become a model of practice in schools and government institutions. The temple's campaign was carried to new heights when in 2005 the beverage company Thai Beverage announced to publicly list in the Stock Exchange of Thailand, which would be the biggest listing in Thai history. Despite attempts by the National Office of Buddhism (a government agency) to prohibit monks from protesting, two thousand monks of the temple organized a chanting of Buddhist texts in front of the Stock Exchange to pressurize them to decline Thai Beverage's initial public offering. In an unprecedented cooperative effort, the temple was soon followed suit by former Black May revolt leader Chamlong Srimuang and the Santi Asoke movement, holding their protest as well. Subsequently, another 122 religious and social organizations joined, belonging to several religions. The organizations officially asked Prime Minister Thaksin's cooperation to stop the company, in <b>what</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> protest leaders described as [...] "a grave threat to the health and culture" [...] of Thai society. While the Stock Exchange pointed out the economical benefits of this first local listing, opponents referred to rising alcohol abuse in Thai society, ranking fifth in alcohol consumption. Ultimately, the protests led to an indefinite postponement of the listing by the Stock Exchange, as Thai Beverage chose to list in Singapore instead, and the Stock Exchange chief resigned because of the loss of profit.|$|E

40|$|Understanding the {{physiologic}} and endocrinologic {{basis of}} fetal {{development is a}} major goal of perinatal biology. During the past decade a number of technological developments have allowed more precise evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fetus in utero and diagnosis of abnormalities. Despite these methodological achievements, however, there are no specific biological markers currently available to indicate that exposure to a given xenobiotic {{is associated with a}} cellular, subcellular, or pharmacodynamic event. This paper evaluates the following issues: <b>What</b> are <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unique physiologic and endocrinologic features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fetal milieu interieur? What problems are peculiar to fetal assessment? Of what value are techniques such as ultrasonography, amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling, fetoscopy, and fetal blood and tissue sampling for obtaining appropriate biomarkers? <b>What</b> are <b>some</b> examples <b>of</b> validated biomarkers and their applicability?

60|$|The {{following}} is an argument of Descartes to prove, in his a priori manner, the being of a God. The conception, says he, of an infinite Being proves the real existence of such a being. For {{if there is not}} really any such being, I must have made the conception; but if I could make it, I can also unmake it; which evidently is not true; therefore there must be, externally to myself, an archetype, from which the conception was derived. In this argument (which, it may be observed, would equally prove the real existence of ghosts and of witches) the ambiguity is in the pronoun I, by which, in one place, is to be understood my will, in another the laws of my nature. If the conception, existing as it does in my mind, had no original without, the conclusion would unquestionably follow that I made it; that is, the laws of my nature must have somehow evolved it: but that my will made it, would not follow. Now when Descartes afterward adds that I can not unmake the conception, he means that I can not get rid of it by an act of my will: which is true, but is not the proposition required. I can as much unmake this conception as I can any other: no conception which I have once had, can I ever dismiss by mere volition; but <b>what</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> laws of my nature have produced, other laws, or those same laws in other circumstances, may, and often do, subsequently efface.|$|E
6000|$|They {{could not}} {{converse}} any more just then, {{and in the}} next polka, Clara, who not being come out, was not well off for partners, was extremely honoured and delighted by being asked to dance by Mr. Arundel. When the turn of a quadrille came round again, Edmund, as good as his word, introduced to Marian his youthful ensign, and she, dreadfully afraid of not obeying Edmund by being agreeable to his friend, set herself to talk with all her might; told him <b>what</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> costumes were intended to represent, speculated as to the others, found him very pleasant, and ended by making him consider his friend's cousin as delightful as she was handsome, and he had been very much impressed with her countenance. She saw Edmund was well pleased to see him looking animated and gratified, and the consequence was that she had to dance with another of his brother officers, and after all it had not been by any means such hard work to be amiable as she was apt to imagine. At any rate she never liked a ball so well, but then she had never met Edmund at any other, which might account for it. After the last quadrille, Mrs. Lyddell summoned her to come home, they took their leave of Caroline and Clara, whom Mrs. Lyddell promised to fetch to-morrow: Lady Julia was particularly full of empressement and affection, delighted that dear Caroline had been looking so lovely. She even came out with them to the cloak-room, where her son was assiduous in shawling Mrs. Lyddell, and all manner of civilities seemed to be passing among them in a low voice, while Edmund having disengaged Marian's shawl from the surrounding drapery, said, as he put it round her, [...] "Then it is settled that I take Gerald and try to do for the best?" ...|$|E
60|$|Nothing lacked now but the opportune {{recollection}} {{that this}} was the region where the natives had been so wicked in times past that an ingenious statesman, such as have seldom been wanting to Spain, imagined bringing in a colony of German peasants to mix with them and reform them. That is <b>what</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> books say, but others say that the region had remained unpeopled after the first exile of the conquered Moors. All hold that the notion of mixing the colonists and the natives worked the wrong way; the natives were not reformed, but the colonists were depraved and stood in with the local brigands, ultimately, if not immediately. This is the view suggested, if not taken, by that amusing emissary, George Borrow, who seems in his Bible in Spain to have been equally employed in distributing the truths of the New Testament and collecting material for the most dramatic study of Spanish civilization known to literature. It is a delightful book, and not least delightful in the moments of misgiving which it imparts to the reader, when he does not know whether to prize more the author's observation or his invention, whichever it may be. Borrow reports a conversation with an innkeeper and his wife of the Colonial German descent, who gave a good enough account of themselves, and then adds the dark intimation of an Italian companion that they could not be honestly keeping a hotel in that unfrequented place. It was not just in that place that our delay had chosen to occur, but it was in the same colonized region, and I am glad now that I had not remembered the incident from my first reading of Borrow. It was sufficiently uncomfortable to have some vague association with the failure of that excellent statesman's plan, blending creepily with the feeling of desolation from the gathering dark, and I now recall the distinct relief given by the unexpected appearance of two such Guardias Civiles as travel with every Spanish train, in the space before our lonely station.|$|E
