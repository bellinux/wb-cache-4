40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> a problem GP-hard by considering the binomial- 3 problem. In the process, we discuss {{the efficacy of the}} metaphor of an adaptive fitness landscape to explain what is GP-hard. We show that for at least this problem, the metaphor is misleading. 1 INTRODUCTION <b>What</b> <b>makes</b> a problem GP-hard? Unlike other areas in evolutionary computation, genetic programming (GP) has but a nascent body of theoretical work that has addressed this subject. Guidance for understanding <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> a problem difficult for genetic programming has come from work and ideas in areas like genetic algorithms (GA). For example, one could take a cue from previous work in genetic algorithms and posit that <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> for a GP-hard problem is <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> for a GA-hard problem [...] -a rugged fitness landscape (a deceptive fitness landscape, a flat fitness landscape, etc.). As of this writing, however, GP theory has furnished only a few principles to guide practitioners about wheth [...] ...|$|R

The cultures of cities are far less predictable than their hard infrastructure. You can quantify good transport links, and you can commission public buildings or even the quasi&# 8208;scientific art of designing successful communities, yet there are few roadmaps to apply to the hard task of fostering a dynamic successful culture. It is much more than placement of monuments, buildings or transport links...|$|R
