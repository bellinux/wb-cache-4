2500|$|The narrowness, {{crowds and}} mud on the Paris streets {{led to the}} {{creation}} of a new kind of commercial street, the covered passage, dry and well-lit, where Parisians be sheltered from the weather, stroll, look in the shop windows, and dine in cafes. The first such gallery was opened at the Palais-Royal in 1786, and became immediately popular. It was followed by the Passage Feydau (1790–91), Passage du Caire (1799), Passage des Panoramas (1800), Galerie Saint-Honoré (1807), Passage Delorme (between 188 rue de Rivoli and 177 rue Saint-Honoré, in 1808, and the galerie and passage Montesquieu (now rue Montesquieu) in 1811 and 1812. The Passage des Panoramas took its name from an exhibition organized on the site by the American inventor Robert Fulton. He came to Paris in 1796 to try to interest Napoleon and the French Directory in his inventions, the steamship, submarine and torpedo; while <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> he built an exhibit space with two rotundas and showed panoramic paintings of Paris, Toulon, Jerusalem, Rome and other cities. Napoleon, who had little interest in the navy, rejected Fulton's inventions, and Fulton went to London instead. In 1800 the covered shopping street opened in the same building, and became a popular success.|$|E

60|$|<b>As</b> she <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer,</b> Mr Dombey answered, 'Eminently so.|$|R

6000|$|He <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> imperturbable but {{inwardly}} elated. It {{came in a}} demure murmur, eyelashes lowered with fascinating effect. [...] "You {{must not}} be mechant as well as mad." ...|$|R
