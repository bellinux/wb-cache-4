[...] "What was the origin of our slave population?" [...] he rhetorically asked. [...] "The evil commenced when we <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> Colonial state, but acts were passed by our Colonial Legislature, prohibiting the importation, of more slaves, into the Colony. These were rejected by the Crown." [...] To the dismay of states' rights proponents, he was willing to accept the federal government's financial assistance to emancipate and transport freed slaves to other countries. At the convention, Monroe made his final public statement on slavery, proposing that Virginia emancipate and deport its bondsmen with [...] "the aid of the Union." ...|$|E
2500|$|... – Chancellor Angela Merkel called Russia's actions [...] "unacceptable" [...] {{and their}} doings would break {{international}} law. Merkel reminded that Russia accepted {{the independence of}} Ukraine in 1994 and is now not honoring the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances. In a policy statement delivered to the Bundestag, she stated that [...] "Ukraine's territorial integrity is not negotiable". She was reported saying that Putin [...] "lives in a different world" [...] while talking with Barack Obama via phone. Chancellor Merkel also stated [...] "The so-called referendum…, {{the declaration of independence}} …, and the absorption into the Russian Federation (<b>were),</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> firm opinion,…against international law" [...] and that it was [...] "shameful" [...] for Russia to compare the independence of Kosovo with the referendum on the Russian annexation of Crimea. In March 2015, after talks with Petro Poroshenko, Angela Merkel remarked that the annexation was in violation of international law, and therefore it's Germany's goal to restore the Crimean peninsula to Ukraine.|$|E
2500|$|Overstock filed {{a lawsuit}} against the hedge fund Rocker Partners in 2005, for libel, unfair {{business}} practices and tortious interference, saying it colluded with a research firm, Gradient Analytics, in short-selling the company while paying Gradient Analytics to publish negative reports about Overstock.com and supplying pre-publication copies to Rocker. Naked short-selling was not alleged in that suit. In a conference call with analysts in August 2005, a day after the suit was filed, Byrne said that [...] "there's been a plan since we <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> teens to destroy our stock, drive it down to $6--$10 ... and even a plan for how the company would then get whacked up."

Fortune writer Bethany McLean said that Byrne had become a [...] "hero to those who believe that short-sellers are the operators of Wall Street's ultimate black box, predators who destroy companies through innuendo, bullying, political connections—and sometimes through an illegal practice known as 'naked shorting.'" [...] Byrne financed and largely wrote a full-page advertisement in the Washington Post which said [...] "Naked short-selling ... is literally stealing money from the widows, retirees, and other small investors." [...] In a letter to the Wall Street Journal in April 2006, Byrne contended that [...] "blackguards have practiced 'failure to deliver'" [...] of securities, were [...] "destroying businesses and (probably) destabilizing our capital markets." [...] Since 2005, Overstock has filed two lawsuits relating to the matters under Byrne's direction.

He also accused the security personnel of fleeing the scene. He questioned why the Pakistan team which usually travelled with the Sri Lankan team was delayed by seven minutes that day and avoided being attacked. Javed Miandad was critical of Broad's comments and demanded that International Cricket Council ban him for life. Pakistan Cricket Board lodged a formal complaint against Chris Broad with the International Cricket Council on 9 March 2009. Ijaz Butt, the head of Pakistan Cricket Board accused Broad of lying. Umpire Simon Taufel also said that the umpire's minibus was abandoned while the players' bus was moved to the ground to evacuate the players. [...] Slamming the security entourage for abandoning them and inability of the police to arrest the attackers Simon said,"You tell me why no one was caught. You tell me why. Supposedly 25 armed commandos <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> convoy, and when the team bus got going again, we were left on our own." [...] Co-umpire Steve Davis said [...] "he felt let down" [...] by the security. International Cricket Council umpires performance manager for East Asia, Sri Lanka and Pakistan, Peter Manuel told Dawn [...] that the minivan carrying the umpires was basically abandoned by the security personnel. 'It was unbelievable. Bullets were raining on us and not a shot was fired in our defense by the Pakistan security officials,' the outraged Manuel said. Sri Lanka coach Trevor Bayliss backed the comments made by Simon Taufel, Chris Broad and Steve Davis criticising the security. Intikhab Alab, Pakistan cricket team's coach, asked Chris Broad to apologise to his country and team due to the remarks he made against Pakistani police security.
