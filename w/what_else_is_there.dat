500|$|I don’t {{know what}} this pro {{football}} mystique is. I’ve gone to the pro camps. They throw the ball, they catch the ball. Many of them are ex-USC players. I’m not amazed at what they do. I’ve watched the pros play. They run traps, they pitch the ball, they sweep. <b>What</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> <b>there?</b> - John McKay, in Sports Illustrated ...|$|E
500|$|Erin expresses {{frustration}} that Andy {{is still with}} Jessica. [...] After Andy and Dwight jointly choose her for the project team, she relates in a talking head {{that she is not}} going to return to Scranton once she arrives in Florida. At the end of the episode, it is revealed that Cathy has ulterior motives for the trip, intending to seduce Jim while the two are in Florida together, stating, during a cell phone conversation to an unidentified friend, that [...] "... Definitely we will. It's three weeks in Tallahassee. <b>What</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> to do?" ...|$|E
500|$|The Dreamcast {{version was}} heavily criticized. Ryan Davis of GameSpot stated that [...] "the {{best bet for}} all {{involved}} would be to take your chips elsewhere". Similarly, IGN editor Jeremy Dunham noted that [...] "the blandness of the game's presentation would probably disappoint {{the most basic of}} cavemen. Even the graphics are disappointing. True, those card tables can look very realistic, but <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> to marvel at? Nothing! Without any type of exploration feature, or other characters there isn't anything to render". Allgame's Bryan Hightower criticized that [...] "there are not enough games, there are annoying wait times, and the help mode is terrible". He also complained that [...] "the dealer deals painfully slow and has to say what cards you have twice. You can already read your hand right on the screen, so you don't need the dealer to waste your time". Hightower also cited that [...] "when you win at slots, the camera always goes {{to the bottom of the}} machine to show you the payout scale" [...] which [...] "becomes frustrating after a few credits because it is so slow. The act of leaving the table or machine is even slower". He also said that the advice the game gives you is [...] "Perhaps the most irritating 'feature' of this game" [...] because [...] "Each time you do something the computer wouldn't have done, a pop-up screen will appear that adds more time to the lengthy procedure of completing a bet". Hightower commented that [...] "The above-par graphics are quickly negated by the rock-bottom enjoyment factor" [...] and that [...] "this game doesn't have any of the character the real casino has".|$|E
6000|$|Amyas went forward, {{called the}} men together, {{and told them}} the plan. It was not very cheerfully received: but <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> to <b>be</b> done! ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{thought they}} agreed on every subject {{that one could}} violently {{disagree}} about—religion, politics, vivisection, the Derby decision, the Falconer Report; <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> left to quarrel about?” ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> so much, {{so much to}} {{be thankful}} for! And since God chose to take Andor away, <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> to live for, save to see her mother and father contented? ...|$|R
60|$|LORD GORING. <b>What</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> to live for, father? Nothing ages like happiness.|$|E
6000|$|And {{with the}} scent of the flower, crushed by their hands, {{stirring}} his senses, Fort thought: 'Ah, <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> <b>there,</b> in these forsaken days?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So it is, but <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> to do? We don't want poor Tom {{to become}} hopelessly lost, {{and in such}} a far-away country as that." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Cooke put it down. It {{was entirely}} {{a matter of}} course. <b>What</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> to <b>be</b> done? And when he had gone the round of his {{followers}} he turned to Farrar and me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Till Easter, then." [...] And he {{held out}} his hand. I took it limply, thus {{clenching}} the bargain of infamy between us. <b>What</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> for me. <b>What,</b> otherwise, was to become of Anne? ...|$|R
6000|$|It wasn't Archie's fault really. Its true {{he went to}} America {{and fell}} in love with Lucille, the {{daughter}} of a millionaire hotel proprietor and if he did marry her--well, <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> to do? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Cox, this is Harris. I {{talked to}} him, all right. All I could get is the {{statement}} that he's a plant. <b>What</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> <b>there?</b> What kind of behavior pattern?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{become a}} club and {{restaurant}} lounger {{in my old}} age," [...] he declared, a little bitterly. [...] "Almost a boulevardier. Still, <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> for a man without a country to do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stuff! I'm in a corner. <b>What</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> to do? What less {{could we}} do? What's the money for, if it isn't to--" [...] Hilary choked with the emotion that filled {{him at the}} sight of his son's face.|$|E
6000|$|Lord Emsworth {{began to}} feel like a hunted stag. He could not go on saying [...] "Ah!" [...] indefinitely; yet <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> to say to this curious little beastly sort of a beetle kind of thing? ...|$|R
60|$|<b>What</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> for Marjorie to contemplate? If she didn't {{take this}} {{by no means}} unattractive line, what was the alternative? Some sort of {{employment}} after a battle with her father, a parsimonious life, and even then the Oxbridge tradesmen and their immortal bills....|$|R
60|$|<b>What</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> to <b>be</b> done? <b>There</b> <b>was</b> {{nothing that}} she longed for {{at that moment}} except to see Will: the {{possibility}} of seeing him had thrust itself insistently between her and every other object; and yet she had a throbbing excitement like an alarm upon her--a sense that she was doing something daringly defiant for his sake.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!--Driftwood!" [...] {{said the}} young man from Oxford, very bitterly, with a fling of all his limbs. [...] "The middle way is nothingness. It is one thing or the other. Eat or destroy. Eat or destroy! <b>What</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> to do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What I said {{in answer}} to this, and what I did as time advanced, it is surely needless to tell you. You have read the {{newspapers}} which announce their marriage, and their departure for Italy. <b>What</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> left for me to say? ...|$|E
6000|$|CAESAR. The Egyptians {{have made}} it up for me. <b>What</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> to do? And mind where you jump: I {{do not want to}} get your {{fourteen}} stone in the small of my back as I come up. (He runs up the steps and stands on the coping.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How was I to know?" [...] she asked, and {{she told}} over again the story of that memorable landing, but with new, extenuating details. It was Adeline herself who had cried first, [...] "She must be saved!" [...] Mrs. Bunting made a special point of that. [...] "And <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> for me to do?" [...] she asked.|$|R
60|$|What {{good was}} this place, this college? What good was Anglo-Saxon, when one only learned {{it in order}} to answer {{examination}} questions, in order that one should have a higher commercial value later on? She was sick with this long service at the inner commercial shrine. Yet <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> <b>there?</b> Was life all this, and this only? Everywhere, everything was debased to the same service. Everything went to produce vulgar things, to encumber material life.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Sam, {{why did you}} tear those papers;--Her Majesty's Mail papers? <b>What</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> to expect? 'Dismissal--B. B.;' Why did you do it,--and you {{engaged to}} a young woman? No;--don't come nigh to me. How is a young woman {{to go and get}} herself married to a young man, and he with nothing to support her? It isn't to be thought of. When I heard those words, 'Dismissal--B. B.,' I thought my very heart would sink within me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It can but help them," [...] rejoined Chauvelin suavely. [...] "If {{you will}} act as I shall direct I pledge you my word that the wench will walk to the Rat Mort of her free will and at the hour when you want her. <b>What</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> to say?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{else can}} we do?" [...] said Adye. [...] "I must go down at once and begin organising. But why not come? Yes--you come too! Come, and we must hold a sort of council of war--get Hopps to help--and the railway managers. By Jove! it's urgent. Come along--tell me as we go. <b>What</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> we can do? Put that stuff down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Have {{you heard}} him? He has cursed me because I love you. You brought me {{suffering}} and strife--and his curse. And {{now you want}} to take me far away where I would lose you, lose my life; because your love is my life now. <b>What</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> <b>there?</b> Do not move," [...] she cried violently, as he stirred a little--"do not speak! Take this! Sleep in peace!" ...|$|E
60|$|How firmly {{the bonds}} of an old {{relationship}} can hold one! I remember when {{a few years ago}} he reached that toiled-for goal, I wrote in a tone of gratified surprise that in this blatant age, such disinterested effort as his should receive even so belated a recognition. Yet <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> for me to write? We all have our Siddonses, with whom <b>there</b> <b>are</b> no alternatives but insincerity or a disproportionate destructiveness. I am still largely Siddonsized, little son, and so, I fear, you will have to be.|$|R
6000|$|It {{had been}} some hours since I had used the oars, but whether we had drifted, or {{remained}} where we were when I stopped rowing, of course I could not know; but this mattered very little; our boat was slowly sinking beneath us, and it could make no difference whether we went down in one spot or an other. I sat and racked my brain to think {{what could be done}} in this fearful emergency. To bail any longer was useless labor, and <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> that we could do? ...|$|R
60|$|The agent's son {{scarcely}} saw <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{for him to}} do.|$|R
6000|$|She {{kept her}} {{absolutely}} ingenuous eyes upon his. [...] "If {{you could see}} the place where I live you wouldn't ask that. I live in Brickdust Row. They call it that because there's red dust from the bricks crumbling over everything. I've lived there for more than four years. There's no place to receive company. You can't have anybody come to your room. <b>What</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> to do? A girl has got to meet the men, hasn't she?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My darling, <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> to do?" [...] {{reasoned}} the Irishman. [...] "What other occupation {{is there}} for an active man on this earth, except to marry you? What's the alternative to marriage, barring sleep? It's not liberty, Rosamund. Unless you marry God, as our nuns do in Ireland, you must marry Man--that is Me. The only third thing is to marry yourself-- yourself, yourself, yourself--the only companion that is never satisfied-- and never satisfactory." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We've got {{to stand}} up to the job," [...] said Sir Richmond. [...] "Anyhow, <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> to do? We MAY keep things together.... I've got to do my bit. And if only I could hold myself at it, I could beat those fellows. But that's where the devil of it comes in. Never have I been so desirous to work well in my life. And never have I been so slack and weak-willed and inaccurate.... Sloppy.... Indolent.... VICIOUS!..." ...|$|E
6000|$|They {{did all the}} talking--the young men. They {{addressed}} the sludge-queen curtly and disrespectfully, as if to say: [...] "What's she up to?" [...] Her airs were finely thrown away. Still she showed off. <b>What</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> to eat? <b>There</b> <b>was</b> the meat that had been boiled for the soup. We knew what that meant. I had as lief eat the foot of an old worsted stocking. Nothing else, you sludge queen? No, {{what do you want}} anything else for?--Beefsteak--what's the good of asking for beefsteak or any other steak on a Monday. Go to the butcher's and see for yourself.|$|R
60|$|<b>What</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> {{to do but}} be patient? It was all amazing unjust, but to be {{a married}} woman she was {{beginning}} to understand is to be outside justice. It is autocracy. She had once imagined otherwise, and most of her life had been the slow unlearning of that initial error. She had imagined that the hostels were hers simply because he had put it in that way. They had never been anything but his, and now it was manifest he would do what he liked with his own. The law takes no cognizance of the unwritten terms of a domestic reconciliation.|$|R
60|$|What {{was he to}} do {{this evening}} to pass the time? He {{might as well go}} to the Rainbow, and hear the talk about the cock-fighting: {{everybody}} <b>was</b> <b>there,</b> and <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> to <b>be</b> done? Though, for his own part, he did not care a button for cock-fighting. Snuff, the brown spaniel, who had placed herself in front of him, and had been watching him for some time, now jumped up in impatience for the expected caress. But Godfrey thrust her away without looking at her, and left the room, followed humbly by the unresenting Snuff--perhaps because she saw no other career open to her.|$|R
