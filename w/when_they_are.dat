5|$|Animals such as frogs are {{patterned}} so that <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> at {{rest with}} legs tucked in, their outline is powerfully disrupted with markings {{that seem to}} flow across body and leg boundaries. Eyes too are often hidden in stripes.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin, {{especially}} {{as a component}} of an aspirin/paracetamol/caffeine combination, is considered a first-line therapy in the treatment of migraine, and comparable to lower doses of sumatriptan. It is most effective at stopping migraines <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> first beginning.|$|E
5000|$|The {{best result}} {{for the club}} was {{reaching}} the last 32 in 1995-1996, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> beaten by Martigues, in 2001-2002, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> beaten by Châteauroux, and in 2004-2005, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> beaten by Libourne-Saint-Seurin.|$|R
50|$|Social: In lizards, FID {{was shorter}} during social {{encounters}} than <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> solitary. and FID was shorter in female lizards <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> interacting with males than <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> alone; {{it was also}} shorter in males interacting with either sex.|$|R
30|$|As predicted, {{characters}} {{were significantly more}} likely to <b>be</b> chosen last <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> described as having special needs than <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> described as having a disability (z[*]=[*] 2.362, p[*]=[*] 0.009, one-tailed). Similarly, and as predicted, {{characters were}} significantly more likely to <b>be</b> chosen last <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> described as having special needs than <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> described as having a certain disability (z[*]=[*] 1.908, p[*]=[*] 0.028, one-tailed).|$|R
5|$|Based on observations, Iridomyrmex {{workers can}} be {{deformed}} <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> born. For example, a captured specimen had its propodeum and gaster fused together, and the petiole was still present but enlarged. Despite the deformity, the worker was {{still able to}} forage with little trouble.|$|E
5|$|Pulmonary oxygen {{toxicity}} is {{an entirely}} avoidable event while diving. The limited duration and naturally intermittent nature of most diving makes this a relatively rare (and even then, reversible) complication for divers. Established guidelines enable divers to calculate <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> at risk of pulmonary toxicity.|$|E
5|$|The {{absorption}} band of simple cations shift toward shorter wavelength <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> involved in more covalent interactions. This occurs during hydration of metal ions, so colourless anhydrous ionic compounds with an anion absorbing {{in the infrared}} can become colourful in solution.|$|E
50|$|Oh, The {{grand old}} Duke of York,He had ten {{thousand}} men;He marched {{them up to}} the top of the hill,And he marched them down again.And <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> up, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> up,And <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> down, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> down,And <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> only half-way up,They were neither up nor down.|$|R

5|$|The {{controversial}} Milgram experiment into obedience by Stanley Milgram {{showed that}} many people lack the psychological resources to openly resist authority, even <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> directed to act callously and inhumanely against an innocent victim.|$|E
5|$|The ram {{uses his}} vomeronasal organ (sometimes called the Jacobson's organ) {{to sense the}} pheromones of ewes and detect <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> in estrus. The ewe uses her vomeronasal organ for early {{recognition}} of her neonate lamb.|$|E
5|$|The species {{exhibits}} {{a variety of}} vocal behaviors. The cry of a pup is often {{compared to that of}} a seagull. Females coo <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> apparently content; males may grunt instead. Distressed or frightened adults may whistle, hiss, or in extreme circumstances, scream.|$|E

50|$|This {{movie is}} {{the story about the}} best friends who get {{separated}} <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> young but meet together with their dreams <b>they</b> had <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> younger.|$|R
5|$|A clutch {{consists}} of three to five light-blue eggs, and is incubated by the female alone. The eggs hatch after 14days, and the chicks leave the nest a further two weeks later. The altricial chicks are naked and have their eyes closed {{for the first few}} days after hatching. While the chicks are still young, the mother broods them continuously. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> older, the mother will brood them only at night or during bad weather.|$|E
5|$|A new {{character}} called Kip Berenger (Joseph Cohen-Cole) is introduced, {{a computer}} games expert who followed the uprising {{and is a}} fan of Lioba.

5|$|A small grayed-out grenade icon {{appears in}} the center of the screen when the player is near a grenade, with an arrow {{pointing}} in the direction of the grenade. Enemies can sometimes seem to be dead <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not, where the enemy can still wield his side arm and fire at the player.|$|E
30|$|Characters {{were also}} {{significantly}} more likely to <b>be</b> chosen last <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> described as having special needs than when no (disability) label was included (z[*]=[*] 6.008, p[*]<[*] 0.001, one-tailed). In contrast, characters were equally likely to <b>be</b> chosen last <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> described as having a disability as <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> described as having a certain disability (z[*]=[*]− 0.455, p[*]=[*] 0.653, two-tailed).|$|R

5|$|According to the varying-permeability model, {{gas bubble}} nuclei are simply stable microbubbles. The {{stability}} of these microbubbles {{is due to}} elastic skins or membranes consisting of surface-active molecules. These skins are normally permeable to gas, and collapse is prevented by their compression strength. These skins can become stiff and effectively impermeable to gas <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> subjected to large compressions, typically exceeding 8atm, at which stage the pressure inside increases during further compression as predicted by Boyle's law.|$|E
5|$|Adults have a {{complete}} moult after breeding which takes about 80 days, starting from late May onwards and finishing by late September. The moult period for Siberian birds is more compressed, running from June to mid-September. Fledged juveniles moult some of their wing coverts <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> about eight weeks old.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the species}} is {{primarily}} fossorial, it occasionally gathers food near the entrance of a tunnel. Dandelions seem to be its favorite food, and are also used as nesting material. During breeding season males will enter the tunnels of females, and males and females may make purring (or cooing) sounds <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> together. Mothers seem to comfort the young by softly vocalizing, with the young twittering in response.|$|E

5|$|Aphids: There {{are five}} species of aphids {{commonly}} found on apples: apple grain aphid, rosy apple aphid, apple aphid, spirea aphid and the woolly apple aphid. The aphid species {{can be identified}} by their color, {{the time of year}} <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> present and by differences in the cornicles, which are small paired projections from the rear of aphids. Aphids feed on foliage using needle-like mouth parts to suck out plant juices. When present in high numbers, certain species reduce tree growth and vigor.|$|E
5|$|As time passes, {{with no sign}} of land {{or other}} ships, Parker {{suggests}} that one of them should be killed as food for the others. They draw straws, following the Custom of the Sea and Parker is sacrificed. This gives the others a reprieve, but Augustus soon dies from wounds received when they reclaimed the Grampus, and several more storms batter the already badly damaged ship. Pym and Peters float on the upturned hull and are close to death <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> rescued by the Jane Guy, a ship out of Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves filter {{large amounts}} of water to feed and breathe {{but they are not}} {{permanently}} open. They regularly shut their valves to enter a resting state, even <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> permanently submerged. In oysters, for example, their behaviour follows very strict circatidal and circadian rhythms according to the relative positions of the moon and sun. During neap tides, they exhibit much longer closing periods than during spring tides.|$|E
