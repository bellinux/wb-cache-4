5|$|Although the {{recruitment}} of Tomáš Ujfaluši and Johnny Heitinga pushed Pablo down the pecking order, he finished the 2008–09 season with 21 league appearances. An offer from Real Zaragoza of less than €5m {{was rejected by the}} club as insufficient, but despite the arrival of Juanito adding to the defensive competition, Pablo said he <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> out the remaining year of his contract. In that final season, he played rarely. He took part in the early rounds of the Copa del Rey and in the group stage of the Champions League as Atlético finished third in their group and dropped into the Europa League, but made his last appearance for the club, as a late substitute, on 20 December 2009.|$|E
5|$|Mao Zedong {{had been}} born and raised at his father's farm in Shaoshanchong, a small rural village named for the nearby Shaoshan mountain. His disciplinarian father, Mao Yichang, had decided to deal with Zedong's rebellious {{attitude}} in a manner typical of the time, by forcing him into an arranged marriage that would compel him to take family matters seriously. Yichang also desired a helper for his own wife, Wen Qimei, whose health had deteriorated through years of heavy agricultural labour. He selected Luo Yixiu in either late 1907 or 1908. Her kinship to the Maos may have helped in this selection, as Luo Yixiu's mother's four brothers, surnamed Mao, lived only two li (1 km) from Mao Yichang's home in Shaoshanchong. Following traditional procedures, a matchmaker would {{have been sent to}} the Luo family house, and the Luo family would have been socially expected to accept the marriage proposal immediately. Luo Helou <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his eldest daughter married. The two families exchanged gifts and signed the marriage contract, after which the marriage was considered inviolable.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the American Civil War, she volunteered for the Union Army as a civilian. The U.S. Army had no female surgeons, and at first she was allowed to practice only as a nurse. During this period, she served at the First Battle of Bull Run (Manassas), July 21, 1861, and at the Patent Office Hospital in Washington, D.C. She worked as an unpaid field surgeon near the Union front lines, including at the Battle of Fredericksburg and in Chattanooga after the Battle of Chickamauga. As a suffragist, she <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> women serving as soldiers, and alerted the press to the case of Frances Hook, in Ward 2 of the Chattanooga hospital, a woman who served in the Union forces disguised as a man. Walker was the first female surgeon of the Union army. She wore men's clothing during her work, claiming it to be easier for high demands of her work.|$|E
25|$|Not {{wanting to}} be left without any means of propaganda, Rocker founded the Germinal in March 1900. Compared to Arbeter Fraint, it was more theoretical, {{applying}} anarchist thought {{to the analysis of}} literature and philosophy. It represented a maturation of Rocker's thinking towards Kropotkin-ite anarchism and would survive until March 1903. 1902 saw the London Jews being targeted by a wave of anti-alien sentiment, while Rocker was away for a year in Leeds. Upon return in September, he <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the Jewish anarchists had kept the Arbeter Fraint organization alive. A conference of all Jewish anarchists of the city on December 26 decided for a re-launch of the Arbeter Fraint newspaper as the organ of all Jewish anarchists in Great Britain and Paris and made Rocker the editor. The first issue appeared on March 20, 1903. Following the Kishinev pogrom in the Russian Empire, Rocker led a demonstration in solidarity with the victims, the largest ever gathering of Jews in London. Afterwards he traveled to Leeds, Glasgow, and Edinburgh to lecture on the topic.|$|E
25|$|On 9 December 2014, {{police in}} Stockholm raided the company's {{premises}} and seized servers and other computers and equipment, {{which resulted in}} the website going offline. The raid was in response to a complaint from Rights Alliance, a Swedish anti-piracy group. The Pirate Bay was one of many peer-to-peer and torrent-related websites and apps that went down. One member of the crew was arrested. TorrentFreak reported that most other torrent sites reported a 5–10% increase in traffic from the displaced users, though the shutdown had little effect on overall piracy levels. In retaliation to the raid, a group of hackers claiming to be part of Anonymous allegedly leaked email log-in details of Swedish government officials. The Pirate Bay co-founder Peter Sunde commented in a blog post that he <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the website shut down, believing his successors have done nothing to improve the site, criticising in particular the increased use of advertisements. IsoHunt has since copied much of the original TPB database and made it accessible through oldpiratebay.org, a searchable index of old Pirate Bay torrents. IsoHunt also released a tool called The Open Bay, to allow users to deploy their own version of the Pirate Bay website. The tool is responsible for around 372 mirror sites. Since 17 December 2014, The Pirate Bay's Facebook page has been unavailable. On 22 December 2014, a website was resumed at the domain thepiratebay.se, showing a flip clock with the length of time in days and hours that the site had been offline, and a waving pirate flag. From this day TPB was hosted for a period in Moldova, on Trabia Network (Moldo-German company) servers. The Pirate Bay then began using the services of CloudFlare, a company which offers reverse proxy services. On 1 January 2015, the website presented a countdown to 1 February 2015. The website returned with a prominent phoenix logo displayed at the domain thepiratebay.se on 31 January 2015.|$|E

[...] "The second he popped in at ghost town central ... the scare factor went up", she wrote. Likewise, Tom Burns of UGO deemed all of Lehne's scenes [...] "damn near riveting", while Brett Love of TV Squad {{described}} him as [...] "a perfect evil menace". Diana Steenbergen of IGN deemed Lehne's performance [...] "charismatic and quietly sadistic without being overdone". Despite this praise, she <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the character die because [...] "it frees the show from bogging down by having the Winchesters chasing after the same villain endlessly" [...] and [...] "opens up the opportunity to explore new plots".|$|E

500|$|Knox was notable not so {{much for}} the {{overthrow}} of Roman Catholicism in Scotland, but for assuring the replacement of the established Christian religion with Presbyterianism rather than Anglicanism. It was thanks to Knox that the Presbyterian polity was established, though it took 120 years following his death for this to be achieved in 1689. Meanwhile, he accepted the status quo and <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his friends appointed bishops and archbishops, even preaching at the inauguration of the Protestant Archbishop of St Andrews John Douglas in 1571. In that regard, Knox is considered the notional founder of the Presbyterian denomination, whose members number millions worldwide.|$|E

Joel Kelly of TV Squad criticized the decision to pair Quinn with Finn again in the Valentine's Day oriented episode. He {{saw it as a}} regression of the characters, and commented: [...] "Yes, it feels like Glee Classic, because the series started with the two of them together. But both of them have changed—Quinn more so than Finn—and having them dating again seems like they're going back to the days when Quinn was the icy lead Cheerio and Finn was the nice but dumb star quarterback." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{its initial}} broadcast, the episode was watched by 2.68 million viewers. It {{received}} generally positive reviews from critics. Tina Charles of TV Guide <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Jim Beaver {{become more involved}} in the storyline, and praised Ackles for his [...] "amazing job" [...] during the confrontation between the two Deans. She described the latter scenes as [...] "seamless, yet painful to watch". Although Charles <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the Colt get stolenshe thought the weapon was [...] "too easy" [...] and had lost its mystiqueshe noted her annoyance that the brothers continue to [...] "look ridiculous" [...] because Bela is able to steal things from them. Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune gave the episode an A-. Despite the [...] "sluggish pacing" [...] of the first half, the [...] "paternal baggage" [...] and monster of the week [...] "built up enough emotional resonance to triumph". She noted the actors' performances, such as the [...] "great Winchester moment" [...] in which Sam discusses Dean's demonic pact; for Peterson, [...] "...the dark, wounded look in Jared Padalecki's eyes totally sells it". The [...] "brutally good character writing" [...] and [...] "truly impressive work" [...] done for Dean's dream-encounter with himself was also lauded, with Peterson writing, [...] "Ackles gives two of his best performances {{in the history of the}} show. At the same time." [...] Like Charles, however, she pointed out how [...] "uncharacteristically stupid about Bela" [...] the Winchesters have been. She commented, [...] "Bela appears to have eaten the writers' brains for breakfast." [...] The episode received a score of 7 out of 7 from TV Squad's Brett Love. Bobby's backstory at first was a [...] "bit of a shock" [...] for him, but he eventually came to realize that it [...] "fits very well". Love also thought that the dream root aspect [...] "worked out great", and deemed the dreamscapes [...] "creepy and unsettling".|$|E

[...] Like Hanson, Isler loved the outcome of Peter and the machine, calling it a [...] "nice plot twist"; he also praised Blair Brown as [...] "one of the many under-appreciated elements of the series." [...] Writing for Mania.com, critic Kurt Anthony Krug acknowledged the episode [...] "had a tough act to follow" [...] after the previous week's episode, but stated [...] "it's still pretty good". Sarah Stegall from SFScope <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Peter [...] "taking a more active role" [...] with the machine plotline, but disliked the episode's religious elements, believing that Walter's scene in the church [...] "felt forced".

Gerrick Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times noted that in previous reviews, he had [...] "never been shy of [...] disdain for Mrs. Schuester", but that his hatred of Terri [...] "vanished" [...] once the lie was over, praising the confrontation between Will and Terri. MTV Aly Semigran praised both actors, especially [...] "a devastated Matthew Morrison" [...] for having [...] "nailed just what a scary, sad, and life-altering moment" [...] it was.

Regarding the character's death, Charles noted that [...] "when [...] went down in 'Abandon All Hope' like [...] did, I felt it. [...] meant something". Though also happy to see Ellen reappear in the fifth season, Ryan was disappointed {{at the lack of}} screentime the character received in [...] "Good God, Y'All!".

Modell said, [...] "South Park episodes don't get much lazier or uninspired than this one. It was like half an idea stretched out forever and ever, and {{with very little}} payoff." [...] Carlos Delgado of If Magazine said the episode plot was too silly and lacked laughs: [...] "All in all, I was left feeling a little cheated.

During filming of the installment, Isaacs {{thought it would be}} funny to moon down the stairs during a scene in which Hannah and Michael go nude swimming, but stated that it would probably break the Standards and Practices law. Filming of the episode commenced at an actual campus swimming pool for one scene. A lady present during filming asked if Isaacs was naked. Isaacs replied that he was not completely naked, but had a [...] "small piece of material taped over [...] genitals"; the lady said [...] "That's naked," [...] adding [...] "I can see your butt crack." [...] In response, Isaacs [...] "taped a piece of material over [...] butt crack". When the last scene was filmed that day, he ran up the stairs, causing the material—which had been secured only by a piece of sealing tape—to fall off. The woman was [...] "furious". Isaacs thought that the team of Awake would have to withdraw the footage, but <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that part was included in the finished episode.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{massacre}} Governor Nuyts was recalled by the VOC governor-general in Batavia for various offences, including {{responsibility for the}} souring of relations with the Japanese. Hans Putmans replaced Nuyts as governor, and immediately wanted to attack the ringleaders in Mattau, but the village was judged too strong to assault directly. Therefore, the Dutch moved against the weaker Bakloan, who they believed sheltered proponents of the massacre, setting out on 23 November 1629, and returning later that day [...] "having killed many people and burned most of the village." [...] The Bakloan villagers sued for peace, and Mattau too signed a nine-month peace accord with the company. However, {{in the years that}} followed, the Mattau, Bakloan and Soulang villagers continued a concerted campaign to harass employees of the company, particularly those who were rebuilding structures destroyed by the Mattauers in Sakam. The situation showed no signs of improvement for the Dutch, until relations between Mattau and Soulang soured in late 1633 and early 1634. The two villages went to war in May 1634, and although Mattau won the fight, the company <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> divisions among the villages which it felt it could exploit.|$|E
