5|$|Colonization and {{expansion}} {{of the kingdom of}} Nri was achieved by sending mbùríchi, or converts, to other settlements. Allegiance to the eze Nri was obtained not by military force but through ritual oath. Religious authority was vested in the local king, and ties were maintained by traveling mbùríchi. By the 14th century, Nri influence extended <b>well</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> nuclear northern Igbo region to Igbo settlements on {{the west bank of the}} Niger and communities affected by the Benin Empire. There is strong evidence to indicate Nri influence <b>well</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> Igbo region to Benin and Southern Igala areas like Idah. At its height, the kingdom of Nri had influence over roughly a third of Igboland and beyond. It reached its furthest extent between 1100 and 1400.|$|E

A 1937 exhibition, Dutch Paintings of the Seventeenth Century, included loans from the Cincinnati Art Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam.

5|$|The Romans {{occupied}} Martigny to {{the north}} of the massif, and their influence spread out <b>well</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> Alps into much of northern Europe. As a result of aggressive pressure from tribes in the north, the imperial forces of Rome were gradually withdrawn from the alpine regions until, by the 5thcentury AD, they had left completely. The areas left behind were occupied in the western part by the Burgundian tribes from what is today France, whilst the Alemanni tribes from Germany moved into eastern parts, resulting in the linguistic divide found today across the Alps.|$|E
5|$|At the {{opposite}} side of the planet, the solar wind stretches Jupiter's magnetic field lines into a long, trailing magnetotail, which sometimes extends <b>well</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> orbit of Saturn. The structure of Jupiter's magnetotail is similar to Earth's. It consists of two lobes (blue areas in the figure), with the magnetic field in the southern lobe pointing toward Jupiter, and that in the northern lobe pointing away from it. The lobes are separated by a thin layer of plasma called the tail current sheet (orange layer in the middle). Like Earth's, the Jovian tail is a channel through which solar plasma enters the inner regions of the magnetosphere, where it is heated and forms the radiation belts at distances closer than 10RJ from Jupiter.|$|E

5|$|At the time, {{a number}} of {{different}} drivers were considered, but the introduction of the laser a few years later provided the first obvious solution with the right combination of features. The desired energies were <b>well</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> state of the art in laser design, so LLNL began a laser development program in the mid-1960s to reach these levels. Each increase in energy led to new and unexpected optical phenomena that had to be overcome, but these were largely solved by the mid-1970s. Working in parallel with the laser teams, physicists studying the expected reaction using computer simulations adapted from thermonuclear bomb work developed a program known as LASNEX that suggested Q of 1 could be produced at much lower energy levels, in the kilojoule range, levels that the laser team were now able to deliver.|$|E
5|$|Cantillon {{is one of}} the few economists {{cited by}} Adam Smith, who {{directly}} borrows Cantillon's sustenance theory of wages. Large sections of Smith's economic theory were possibly directly influenced by Cantillon, although in many respects Adam Smith advanced <b>well</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> scope of Cantillon. Some economic historians have argued that Adam Smith provided little of value from his own intellect, notably Schumpeter and Rothbard. In any case, through his influence on Adam Smith and the physiocrats, Cantillon was quite possibly the pre-classical economist who contributed most to the ideas of the classical school. Illustrative of this was Cantillon's influence on Say, which is noticeable in the methodology employed in the latter's Treatise on Political Economy.|$|E

The Deepak-class tankers were the first warships constructed for India by Fincantieri. The construction of the ship began in November 2009 at Fincantieri's Sestri Ponente shipyard in Italy. The sea trials started in December 2010. The ship was formally handed over to the Indian Navy on 23 September 2011, in under two years.

5|$|In the South West Pacific, a {{conventional}} strategic bombing campaign {{was out of}} the question, as industrial targets in Japan were <b>well</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> range of even the largest strategic bombers operating from bases in Australia and New Guinea. Therefore, the primary mission of the Allied bomber force was interdiction of Japanese supply lines, especially the sea lanes. The results of the effort against the Japanese convoy in January were very disappointing; some 416 sorties had been flown with only two ships sunk and three damaged, so clearly, a change of tactics was in order. Group Captain Bill Garing, an RAAF officer on Kenney’s staff with considerable experience in air-sea operations, including a tour of duty in Europe, recommended that Japanese convoys be subjected to simultaneous attack from different altitudes and directions.|$|E
5|$|Looking {{to rebound}} from their disappointing 2010 result, the Opals {{qualified}} for the 2012 Olympic Games in London by beating New Zealand three games to nil in the 2011 FIBA Oceania Championship. They finished the Olympic preliminary series with a 4 – 1 record, losing to France in game 2, but after Belinda Snell sank a <b>well</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> half-court line 3 point shot with less than 1 second on the clock to send the game into overtime.

The Opals accounted for China 75–60 to set up a semifinal game with their long-time s USA. Despite holding a half-time lead, the Opals again fell short losing 86–73. The Opals would however, win their 5th consecutive Olympic medal with an 83–74 win over Russia to claim the bronze.|$|E
5|$|The solar {{magnetic}} field extends <b>well</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> Sun itself. The electrically conducting solar wind plasma carries the Sun's {{magnetic field}} into space, forming {{what is called}} the interplanetary magnetic field. In an approximation known as ideal magnetohydrodynamics, plasma particles only move along the magnetic field lines. As a result, the outward-flowing solar wind stretches the interplanetary magnetic field outward, forcing it into a roughly radial structure. For a simple dipolar solar magnetic field, with opposite hemispherical polarities {{on either side of the}} solar magnetic equator, a thin current sheet is formed in the solar wind. At great distances, the rotation of the Sun twists the dipolar magnetic field and corresponding current sheet into an Archimedean spiral structure called the Parker spiral. The interplanetary magnetic field is much stronger than the dipole component of the solar magnetic field. The Sun's dipole magnetic field of 50–400μT (at the photosphere) reduces with the inverse-cube of the distance to about 0.1nT at the distance of Earth. However, according to spacecraft observations the interplanetary field at Earth's location is around 5nT, about a hundredtimes greater. The difference is due to magnetic fields generated by electrical currents in the plasma surrounding the Sun.|$|E
