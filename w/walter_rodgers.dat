2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1864, the Confederate Army of Tennessee, under Gen. Joseph E. Johnston, was engaged in a {{campaign}} of maneuver against William T. Sherman, who was driving from Chattanooga toward Atlanta. Hood had accepted the position as a corps commander offered by President Davis, a somewhat controversial appointment because of the Texan's relative youth and inexperience, plus his physical disabilities. Despite his two damaged limbs, Hood performed well in the field, riding as much as 20 miles a day without apparent difficulty, strapped to his horse with his artificial leg hanging stiffly, and an orderly following closely behind with crutches. The leg, made of cork, was donated (along {{with a couple of}} spares) by members of his Texas Brigade, who had collected $3,100 in a single day for that purpose; it had been imported from Europe through the Union blockade. On May 12, Hood was baptized by Lieutenant General Leonidas Polk, the former Episcopal Bishop of Louisiana. Colonel <b>Walter</b> H. <b>Rodgers,</b> a witness to the baptism, stated that Hood [...] "looked happy and as though a great burden had been lifted." ...|$|R
