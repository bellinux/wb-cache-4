5|$|During the {{southern}} party's absence the relief ship Morning arrived, bringing fresh supplies. The expedition's organisers {{had assumed that}} the Discovery would be free from the ice in early 1903, enabling Scott to carry out further seaborne exploration and survey <b>work</b> <b>before</b> winter set in. It was intended that Discovery would return to New Zealand in March or April, then home to England via the Pacific, continuing its magnetic survey en route. Morning would provide any assistance that Scott might require during this period.|$|E
5|$|In the Convict Establishment of 1855, the {{day began}} with the wakeup bell at 4:30 am, and the {{officers}} and prisoners assembled in the parade ground at 5:25 am. Prisoners were sent to <b>work</b> <b>before</b> and after breakfast (in their cells), before assembling for muster at midday. This was followed by dinner in the exercise yard or the work site, and more work throughout the afternoon, until supper at 6:00 pm in the cells. Night officers took over at 7:15 pm.|$|E
5|$|Latouche-Tréville, {{named in}} honor of Vice Admiral comte de Latouche-Tréville, was laid down on 26 April 1890 at the Granville {{shipyard}} of Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée. She was launched on 5 November 1893 and commissioned for sea trials on 16 October. While initial trials were successful, further testing revealed multiple problems that required over {{a year and a half}} of <b>work</b> <b>before</b> she was commissioned for service on 6 May 1895.|$|E

5|$|Pablo Miño was {{released}} from prison, but Curto refused to release García, saying that Miño had extenuating circumstances which García did not. Miño's job was to give García the required tools, not to do the maintenance. He was in the street, watching over the van, which was not properly parked and locked, and did not see García's <b>work</b> <b>before</b> the explosion. Curto stopped short of pronouncing Miño innocent at that early stage.|$|E
5|$|Cather {{discussed}} her authorship {{privately with}} her father and friends, but otherwise said {{she was not the}} author. She was reluctant to discuss most of her <b>work</b> <b>before</b> O Pioneers! (1913). According to L. Brent Bohlke, editor of Willa Cather in Person (1990), Cather regarded the Eddy book as poorly written. While it contains some excellent writing and character analysis, Bohkle wrote, it is not well-structured; the editing had failed to rid the book of the serialized nature of the McClure's pieces. Stouck adds that Cather wanted to distance herself from journalism, and sought to minimize her role in the articles because they had angered the Christian Science church.|$|E
5|$|In 1799, the Spanish {{botanist}} Antonio José Cavanilles described Protea acufera, later {{identified as}} a synonym by Salisbury and Robert Brown. I.anethifolius gained its current name in 1809 when it was redescribed as the dill-leaved isopogon (Isopogon anethifolius) by English plantsman Joseph Knight in his controversial work On the cultivation of the plants belonging to {{the natural order of}} Proteeae. Robert Brown had written of the genus Isopogon but Knight had hurried out his <b>work</b> <b>before</b> Brown's. Brown's description appeared in his paper On the natural order of plants called Proteaceae in the Transactions of the Linnean Society in 1810.|$|E

5|$|In November 1956, Presley {{made his}} film debut in Love Me Tender. In 1958, {{he was drafted}} into {{military}} service. He resumed his recording career two years later, producing {{some of his most}} commercially successful <b>work</b> <b>before</b> devoting much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and their accompanying soundtrack albums, most of which were critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed televised comeback special Elvis, which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley featured in the first globally broadcast concert via satellite, Aloha from Hawaii. On August 16, 1977, he suffered a heart attack in his Graceland estate, and died as a result. His death came in the wake of many years of prescription drug abuse.|$|E
5|$|Kwee {{began his}} writing career in 1919 with the stage play Allah jang Palsoe. During the 1920s, he wrote several novels and stage plays while also {{working as a}} journalist, first for Sin Po then for Sin Bin. He {{established}} his first magazine, Panorama, in 1925; {{he went on to}} manage four further magazines, including the literary-oriented Moestika Romans and the religious Sam Kauw Gwat Po. After 1930 Kwee began to focus predominantly on religious texts, particularly those related to Buddhism, Confucianism, and Chinese folk religion, but also relating to Islam. A fluent English speaker, Kwee adapted several of his writings– both fiction and non-fiction– from publications outside the Dutch East Indies. His last <b>work</b> <b>before</b> his death, seven volumes related to various aspects of Confucianism, was published in 1950.|$|E
5|$|Loading at Australian ports was {{frequently}} disorganised and sloppy. Manifests were not flown ahead, so New Guinea Force {{did not know}} the contents of a shipment beforehand. Some ships arrived without manifests. The labelling of contents was also poor, and boxes often had to be broken into to determine their contents. Even then it was not always apparent who the intended recipient was. Much of the problem was poor staff work by the inexperienced Movement Control staff at Advanced Allied Land Forces Headquarters (LHQ) in Brisbane. The Australian Army had never had to handle such <b>work</b> <b>before.</b> Men with experience in the shipping industry were appointed as Movement Control officers, but it took time for them to learn about military cargoes and procedures.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after his}} marriage, Woodruff decided {{to travel to}} England {{in order to take}} {{the second half of the}} FRCS Exam. Woodruff took his new wife over with no {{guarantee}} of employment, and declined a two-year travelling fellowship to Oxford University offered by the Australian Red Cross because it required him to return home and <b>work.</b> <b>Before</b> departing, he applied for a position as a Tutor of Surgery at the University of Sheffield, and learned en route that they had accepted his application. He took the FRCS exam in 1947 and passed—a result that, in Woodruff's view, was certainly not hindered by the fact that one of his examiners, Colonel Julian Taylor, had been with him at Changi.|$|E
5|$|The {{arguments}} {{made in the}} Resolutions and the Report {{were later}} used frequently during the nullification crisis of 1832, when South Carolina declared federal tariffs to be unconstitutional and void within the state. Madison rejected the concept of nullification {{and the notion that}} his arguments supported such a practice. Whether Madison's theory of Republicanism really supported the nullification movement, and more broadly whether the ideas he expressed between 1798 and 1800 are consistent with his <b>work</b> <b>before</b> and after this period, are the main questions surrounding the Report in the modern literature.|$|E
5|$|The {{squadron}} was re-established at RAAF Station Mallala, South Australia, on 1March 1948, when No.2 (Communications) Squadron {{was renamed}} No.34 (Communications) Squadron. It operated as a VIP transport, courier and reconnaissance unit, primarily {{in support of}} the Woomera rocket range, focal point of the Anglo-Australian Long Range Weapons Project during the Cold War. No.34 (Communications) Squadron flew the only Vickers Viking to be taken on strength by the RAAF, and was also the only RAAF squadron to operate the Bristol Freighter. Three Freighters were taken on strength in April and May 1949, and a fourth in September 1951; one was lost with all three crew members in a crash near Mallala on 25November 1953 after its wing failed in flight. The squadron also operated Percival Prince, Auster, Dakota and Anson aircraft, undertaking regular transport duties and disaster relief along with its Woomera support <b>work</b> <b>before</b> disbanding at Mallala on 28October 1955.|$|E

5|$|When {{the first}} traffic flowed, crews had not {{finished}} some final tasks, such as painting stripes. Motorists saw a relocation with several mountain cuts built high up the canyon wall, {{with a view}} of the slide and former lake. The roadbed was not expected to last, as weather conditions had been unfavorable when the asphalt was laid. Two mountain cuts were unstable, requiring several months of <b>work</b> <b>before</b> they could be left unattended. During this time, the state stationed two full-time watches at the cuts, who would close the road while falling rocks were cleared. The cut through Billies Mountain was described by the construction crews as a new, man-made mountain pass.|$|E
5|$|While the {{previous}} two films had concentrated on the Caribbean and Europe, Goldfinger was chosen by Eon for the third film, with the American cinema market in mind. Because Terence Young was refused {{a share of the}} profits, he declined to direct Goldfinger and worked on The Amorous Adventures of Moll Flanders instead, although he had done some pre-production <b>work</b> <b>before</b> he left. In his place, Eon turned to Guy Hamilton to direct; he was keen to inject elements of humour into the series, have more gadgets and build bigger and more elegant sets.|$|E
5|$|A typical early 19th-century casual ward was {{a single}} large room {{furnished}} {{with some kind of}} bedding and perhaps a bucket {{in the middle of the}} floor for sanitation. The bedding on offer could be very basic: the Poor Law authorities in Richmond in the mid-1840s provided only straw and rags, although beds were available for the sick. In return for their night's accommodation vagrants might be expected to undertake a certain amount of <b>work</b> <b>before</b> leaving the next day, such as at Guisborough, where men were required to break stones for three hours and women to pick oakum, two hours before breakfast and one after. Until the passage of the Casual Poor Act 1882 vagrants could discharge themselves before 11 am on the day following their admission, but from 1883 onwards they were required to be detained until 9 am on the second day. Those who were admitted to the workhouse again within one month were required to be detained until the fourth day after their admission.|$|E
