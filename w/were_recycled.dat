5|$|Although {{not officially}} announced, the {{original}} backup crew consisted of Fred W. Haise (CDR), William R. Pogue (CMP) and Gerald P. Carr (LMP), who were targeted for the prime crew assignment on Apollo 19. However, after the cancellations of Apollos 18 and 19 were finalized in September 1970 this crew would not rotate to a lunar mission as planned. Subsequently, Roosa and Mitchell <b>were</b> <b>recycled</b> {{to serve as}} members of the backup crew after returning from Apollo 14, while Pogue and Carr were reassigned to the Skylab program where they flew on Skylab 4.|$|E
5|$|Like John Filson, Timothy Flint also interviewed Boone, and his Biographical Memoir of Daniel Boone, the First Settler of Kentucky (1833) {{became one}} of the best-selling biographies of the 19th century. Flint greatly embellished Boone's adventures, doing for Boone what Parson Weems did for George Washington. In Flint's book, Boone fought hand-to-paw with a bear, escaped from Indians by {{swinging}} on vines (as Tarzan would later do), and so on. Although Boone's family thought the book was absurd, Flint greatly influenced the popular conception of Boone, since these tall tales <b>were</b> <b>recycled</b> in countless dime novels and books aimed at young boys.|$|E
5|$|Storylines often {{centred on}} new signings who {{were unable to}} settle easily in the Melchester team, either because they refused to change their style of play and {{expected}} the Rovers to play around them, such as the uncomprisingly tough defender Duncan McKay, or had personal characteristics that {{made it difficult for}} the other players to accept them, such as ex-circus ball juggler Sammy Spangler. As the average reader probably stayed with the comic for only three or four years, many storylines <b>were</b> <b>recycled.</b> For instance, during the first ten years of his playing career Roy was kidnapped at least five times.|$|E
50|$|Most {{types of}} {{batteries}} can <b>be</b> <b>recycled.</b> However, some batteries <b>are</b> <b>recycled</b> {{more readily than}} others, such as lead-acid automotive batteries (nearly 90% <b>are</b> <b>recycled)</b> and button cells (because of the value and toxicity of their chemicals). Other types, such as alkaline and rechargeable, e.g., nickel-cadmium (Ni-Cd), nickel metal hydride (Ni-MH), lithium-ion (Li-ion) and nickel-zinc (Ni-Zn), can also <b>be</b> <b>recycled.</b>|$|R
50|$|According to the USGS in 2006, 2.9 {{million tonnes}} of Portland cement {{concrete}} (including aggregate) worth $21.9 million <b>was</b> <b>recycled,</b> and 1.6 million tonnes of asphalt concrete (including aggregate) worth $11.8 million <b>was</b> <b>recycled,</b> both by crushed stone operations. Much more of both materials <b>are</b> <b>recycled</b> by construction and demolition firms {{not in the}} USGS survey. For sand and gravel, the USGS survey for 2006 showed that 4.7 million tonnes of cement concrete valued at $32.0 million <b>was</b> <b>recycled,</b> and 6.17 million tonnes of asphalt concrete valued at $45.1 million <b>was</b> <b>recycled.</b> Again, more of both materials <b>are</b> <b>recycled</b> by construction and demolition firms not in this USGS survey. The Construction Materials Recycling Association indicates that there are 325 million tonnes of recoverable construction and demolition materials produced annually.|$|R

5|$|Both pavilions were {{scheduled}} to be unveiled on June 19, 2009. However, Hadid's pavilion was not ready in time; it had construction delays and a construction team change, which led to coverage of the delay in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. Only its aluminum skeleton was available for public viewing on the scheduled date; the work was completed and unveiled on August 4, 2009. The van Berkel pavilion was temporarily closed for repairs August 10â€“14, due to unanticipated wear and tear. Both pavilions were dismantled after November 1, 2009; the materials from van Berkel's <b>were</b> <b>recycled,</b> while Hadid's was stored for possible exhibition elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Development {{continued}} through late 2002, with targeted release dates of December in Japan and early 2003 in North America. During the final stages, two planned dungeons that fell behind schedule were cut {{and replaced with}} a quest to recover Triforce pieces around the Great Sea. Elements of these dungeons <b>were</b> <b>recycled</b> for later Zelda games. On October 15, 2002, Nintendo revealed the game's official Japanese subtitle, Kaze no Takuto (Wind Baton), to emphasize the role of wind in the game. The company announced the official English version, The Wind Waker, on December 2, 2002. In {{the gap between the}} Japanese and North American releases, the designers reworked some troublesome segments, notably shortening the lengthy Triforce quest.|$|E
5|$|PlayStation Official Magazine - UK {{praised the}} story's {{blurring}} of Gallia's moral standing, art style, and most points about its gameplay, positively noting the latter for both its continued {{quality and the}} tweaks to balance and content. Its one major criticism were multiple difficulty spikes, something that had affected the previous games. Heath Hindman of gaming website PlayStation Lifestyle praised the addition of non-linear elements and improvements or removal of mechanics from Valkyria Chronicles II in addition to praising the returning gameplay style of previous games. He also positively noted the story's serious tone. Points criticized in the review <b>were</b> <b>recycled</b> elements, awkward cutscenes that seemed to include all characters in a scene for no good reason, pacing issues, and occasional problems with the game's AI.|$|E
50|$|Almost all paper can <b>be</b> <b>recycled</b> today, {{but some}} types <b>are</b> harder to <b>recycle</b> than others. Papers coated with plastic or {{aluminium}} foil, and papers that are waxed, pasted, or gummed <b>are</b> usually not <b>recycled</b> because {{the process is}} too expensive. Gift-wrap paper also cannot <b>be</b> <b>recycled</b> due to its already poor quality.|$|R

5|$|The Mumbai slum set in {{the season}} finale was {{constructed}} on {{the parking lot of}} the studio, which took two to three weeks to complete. The finale was filmed during one of the hottest heatwaves to hit British Columbia; Tapping found that the set was hotter than the average temperature of the actual Mumbai. Three main cameras were used, one of which was crane-operated. 60 extras were used, the highest number used in an Sanctuary episode. For the extras to be used in more than one scene, they wore many different costumes. The streeting area was also limited in size, so the streets <b>were</b> <b>recycled</b> frequently with every scene. The practical sets of the Sanctuary offices and corridors were also redesigned to look like the Mumbai Sanctuary.|$|E
5|$|The Zimbabwe dollar {{was again}} {{reformed}} on 2 February 2009 when the fourth dollar replaced the third dollar {{at the ratio}} of 1000000000000 (1012) to 1 with the original intention of phasing out the latter by 1 July 2009. The 2009 banknote series was issued for the fourth dollar which circulated from 2 February 2009 until the suspension of the dollar on 12 April 2009. The series consisted of denominations ranging from $1 to $500. The notes had a revised design with chevrons as registration devices, the Zimbabwe Bird in Optically Variable Ink and an iridescent strip. Most parts of the design <b>were</b> <b>recycled</b> from designs of past issues {{and do not have}} a watermark although a plain space existed in the areas where it would normally be positioned.|$|E
5|$|Two {{months of}} {{pre-production}} {{were required to}} create hundreds of shields, spears, and swords, some of which <b>were</b> <b>recycled</b> from Troy and Alexander. Creatures were designed by Jordu Schell, and an animatronic wolf and thirteen animatronic horses were created. The actors trained alongside the stuntmen, and even Snyder joined in. Upwards of 600 costumes were created for the film, as well as extensive prosthetics for various characters and the corpses of Persian soldiers. Shaun Smith and Mark Rappaport worked {{hand in hand with}} Snyder in pre-production to design the look of the individual characters, and to produce the prosthetic makeup effects, props, weapons and dummy bodies required for the production.|$|E
50|$|Certification of the <b>Recycle</b> Content. It <b>is</b> {{necessary}} to discern {{materials that are}} in a product, especially if they <b>are</b> supposedly <b>recycled</b> or able to <b>be</b> <b>recycled.</b> An instance {{of this is the}} recycling of paper material from post- and pre- consumer material, and the ability of certain paper pulps to <b>be</b> <b>recycled.</b>|$|R

5|$|Acetic acid is {{produced}} industrially both synthetically and by bacterial fermentation. About 75% of acetic acid made {{for use in}} the chemical industry is made by the carbonylation of methanol, explained below. The biological route accounts for only about 10% of world production, but it remains important for the production of vinegar because many food purity laws require vinegar used in foods to be of biological origin. Other processes are methyl formate isomerization, conversion of syngas to acetic acid, and gas phase oxidation of ethylene and ethanol. Acetic acid is often a side product of different reactions, i.e. during heterogeneous catalytic acrylic acid synthesis or fermentative lactic acid production. As of 2003â€“2005, total worldwide production of virgin acetic acid was estimated at 5Mt/a (million tonnes per year), approximately half of which was produced in the United States. European production was approximately 1Mt/a and declining, while Japanese production was 0.7Mt/a. Another 1.5Mt <b>were</b> <b>recycled</b> each year, bringing the total world market to 6.5Mt/a. Since then the global production has increased to 10.7 Mt/a (in 2010), and further; however, a slowing in this increase in production is predicted. The two biggest producers of virgin acetic acid are Celanese and BP Chemicals. Other major producers include Millennium Chemicals, Sterling Chemicals, Samsung, Eastman, and Svensk Etanolkemi.|$|E

25|$|Beverage bottles <b>were</b> <b>recycled</b> with a {{refundable}} deposit at some drink {{manufacturers in}} Great Britain and Ireland around 1800, notably Schweppes. An official recycling system with refundable deposits {{was established in}} Sweden for bottles in 1884 and aluminum beverage cans in 1982; the law led to a recycling rate for beverage containers of 84â€“99 percent depending on type, and a glass bottle can be refilled over 20 times on average.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the early}} tokens were created by {{companies}} such as Dowst Miniature Toy Company, which made metal charms and tokens designed to be used on charm bracelets. The battleship and cannon were also used briefly in the Parker Brothers war game Conflict (released in 1940), but after the game failed on the market, the premade pieces <b>were</b> <b>recycled</b> into Monopoly usage. Hasbro recently adopted the battleship and cannon for Diplomacy.|$|E

25|$|Uruk's {{agricultural}} surplus and large population base facilitated {{processes such as}} trade, specialization of crafts {{and the evolution of}} writing. Evidence from excavations such as extensive pottery and the earliest known tablets of writing support these events. Excavation of Uruk is highly complex because older buildings <b>were</b> <b>recycled</b> into newer ones, thus blurring the layers of different historic periods. The topmost layer most likely originated in the Jemdet Nasr period (3100â€“2900 BC) and is built on structures from earlier periods dating back to the Ubaid period.|$|E
25|$|To prevent {{information}} {{identifying the}} Oscar winners from leaking {{ahead of the}} ceremony, Oscar statuettes presented at the ceremony have blank baseplates. Until 2010, winners were expected to return the statuettes to the Academy after the ceremony and wait several weeks to have inscriptions applied. Since 2010, winners have {{had the option of}} having engraved nameplates applied to their statuettes at an inscription-processing station at the Governor's Ball, a party held immediately after the Oscar ceremony. In 2010, the R.S. Owens company made 197 engraved nameplates ahead of the ceremony, bearing the names of every potential winner.
