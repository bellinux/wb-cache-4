I find it sobering to think that while I've been travelling the world, trying to record the complexity and beauty of our planet, that I too have been making my own contribution to global warming. As I recognised when I presented Life on Earth all those years ago, we are a flexible and innovative species and we have the capacity to adapt and modify our behaviour. Now we most certainly have to do so if we're to deal with climate change. It's the biggest challenge <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> faced.|$|E

500|$|The first {{successful}} European dramatic talkie was the all-British Blackmail. Directed by twenty-nine-year-old Alfred Hitchcock, the movie had its London debut June 21, 1929. Originally shot as a silent, Blackmail was restaged to include dialogue sequences, {{along with a}} score and sound effects, before its premiere. A British International Pictures (BIP) production, it was recorded on RCA Photophone, General Electric having bought a share of AEG so they could access the Tobis-Klangfilm markets. Blackmail was a substantial hit; critical response was also positive—notorious curmudgeon Hugh Castle, for example, called it [...] "perhaps the most intelligent mixture of sound and silence <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> seen." ...|$|E
500|$|Tony Scott, {{a critic}} for Variety, thought the {{characters}} were [...] "amiable enough", but they needed [...] "sharper dialogue and fresher observations." [...] Scott {{did not think}} the carpool segment worked, but he liked the opening sequence in the bar. He also praised Lessac's direction, calling it [...] "inventive". Peter Weiniger from The Age was prepared to give the series a chance based on the episode, saying [...] "Like most American sitcoms, The Drew Carey Show {{has its share of}} snappy one-liners but it gives the impression of trying a little too hard. To be fair, this is the first of a series, and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> to see the characters develop. Even Seinfeld took a little time to become essential viewing." ...|$|E
500|$|Birkett {{tried to}} sit as {{regularly}} in the House of Lords as possible, and made his maiden speech on 8 April 1959 {{on the subject of}} crime in the United Kingdom. In May, he moved the first reading of the Obscene Publications Bill, which passed with support {{from both sides of the}} house. Privately, Birkett believed that [...] "there will never be a satisfactory law in England about obscenity. Our 1959 Act is the best <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> done." [...] In 1961, he was again invited by the BBC to give a series of talks on the BBC Home Service, this time titled [...] "Six Great Advocates". He picked Edward Marshall-Hall, Patrick Hastings, Edward Clarke, Rufus Isaacs, Charles Russell and Thomas Erskine. He sat for the last time in the House of Lords on 8 February 1962, where he made a speech criticising an element of the Manchester Corporation Bill which would have water drained from Ullswater to meet the needs of the growing population in Manchester. His speech was [...] "deeply felt and eloquent", and when the votes were announced, Birkett and his supporters had won by 70 votes to 36. The Ullswater Yacht Club now holds an annual Lord Birkett Memorial Trophy Race on the lake.|$|E

I've had years in which I thought, 'Oh my God, this a Tiva year,' {{and there have been}} years he thought were Tiva years….

2500|$|The {{final word}} I would speak about this {{architecture}} is its quality {{of response to}} the needs of America. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> enormous areas that will be built up into cities, we are going to tear down and rebuild most of the edifices, that already exist. With the freedom that this order gives to individual development and with its possibilities of expansion to make it suit the largest building as well as the smallest, it seems to clearly fix the type of our ideal. Before a photograph of the sky-scrapers of Manhattan Island, Raymond Duchamp-Villon said that he saw the possibilities of the modern cathedral. (Walter Pach, 1913) ...|$|E

2500|$|Kindred ‘s plot is non linear; rather, {{it begins}} {{in the middle of}} its end and {{contains}} several flashbacks that connect events in the present and past. In an interview, Butler acknowledged that she split the ending into a [...] "Prologue" [...] and an [...] "Epilogue" [...] so as to [...] "involve the reader and make him or her ask a lot of questions" [...] that could not be answered {{until the end of the}} story. Missy Dehn Kubitschek sees this framing of Dana’s adventures as Butler’s way to highlight the significance of slavery to what Americans consider their contemporary identity. Because [...] "Prologue" [...] occurs before Dana travels in time and [...] "Epilogue" [...] concludes with a message on the necessity to confront the past, we experience the story as Dana’s understanding of what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> to understand ourselves, while the [...] "Epilogue" [...] speaks about the importance of this understanding. Roslyn Nicole Smith proposes that Butler’s framing of the story places Dana literally and figuratively in media res so as to take her out of that in media res; that is, to indicate Dana’s movement from [...] "a historically fragmented Black woman, who defines herself solely on her contemporary experiences" [...] to [...] "a historically integrated identity" [...] who has knowledge of and a connection to her history.|$|E
