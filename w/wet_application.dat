Imaging of small molecules such as drugs and metabolites is particularly problematic because the commonly used washing steps to remove salts are usually omitted as they may also remove the analyte, and analyte spreading is more likely with conventional <b>wet</b> matrix <b>application</b> methods. We have developed a method which uses the application of matrix as a dry, finely divided powder, here referred to as dry matrix application, for the imaging of drug compounds. This appears to offer a complementary method to <b>wet</b> matrix <b>application</b> for the MALDI-MSI of small molecules, with the alternative matrix application techniques producing different ion profiles, and allows the visualization of compounds not observed using <b>wet</b> matrix <b>application</b> methods. We demonstrate its value in imaging clozapine from rat kidney and 4 -bromophenyl- 1, 4 -diazabicyclo(3. 2. 2) nonane- 4 -carboxylic acid from rat brain.

The <b>wet</b> <b>application</b> of nanomaterials to soil had a marginal stimulating effect on reproduction compared to <b>wet</b> <b>application</b> in food, but none {{of the differences between the}} matrices was statistically significant. For dry application no obvious difference was observed. Lapied et al.[8] also compared the effect of earthworm exposure via spiked food and via soil, and attributed the absence of effects in the tests with spiked food to avoidance behavior. We did not observe avoidance of spiked food in our experiments, even though the substance concentrations in the spiked food were higher (1272 mg/kg dm for <b>wet</b> <b>application</b> compared to 100 mg/kg dm in the study discussed above[8]). Feeding was implemented by spreading dung on the soil surface as recommended in the test guideline[21], thus the removal of dung by feeding was easy to verify. The biomass increase in adult worms was also a useful indicator of food uptake, and this was comparable for our spiked food and spiked soil experiments. The behavioral differences may reflect the use of uncoated particles in our experiments and Al 2 O 3 -coated particles in the previous investigation[8]. Avoidance behavior has also been reported for earthworms exposed to Ag nanoparticles indicating perception of the contaminants[37].|$|E

30|$|The most {{significant}} difference in ecotoxicological impact was observed when comparing wet and dry spiking methods. Wet spiking resulted in stronger effects than dry spiking. The effects caused by dry spiking were concentration-dependent for the selected test concentrations (3 - 6 concentrations, depending on the test) whereas {{there was no such}} relationship for the two test concentrations when wet spiking methods were applied using water as the carrier. Lower wet spiking concentrations than those reported here may have resulted in concentration-effect curves. Higher test concentrations {{do not seem to be}} appropriate because the bioavailability of the particles appeared to be limited when highly-concentrated nanoparticle suspensions were used for wet spiking. Therefore, concentration-dependent effect curves are more difficult to obtain for <b>wet</b> <b>application</b> methods compared to dry spiking because the appropriate range of test concentrations has to be selected. The use of highly-concentrated stock suspensions could generate false negative results and incorrect hazard assessments. Limit tests investigating a single high test concentration are therefore inappropriate for wet spiking. Dry spiking is the preferred application method for solid, uncoated TiO 2 and Ag nanoparticles to ensure the effects are not dependent on the particle concentration used for spiking, even though the bioavailability is reduced by the dry spiking method. Satisfactory test substance homogeneity can be achieved using a solid carrier, at least for Ag. If <b>wet</b> <b>application</b> is necessary, then further experiments will be required to establish parameters for successful use, e.g. the use of dispersants that are more suitable than water or recommendations on the procedure to select suitable test concentrations.|$|E

The main subjects which have to be considered in the adaptation of the ecotoxicological test guidelines are spiking of terrestrial and aquatic test systems and the exposure of organisms in aquatic systems. For ENMs available as a powder, it has to be decided whether application via stock suspension (<b>wet</b> <b>application)</b> or via powder (dry application) is recommended.

30|$|No concentration-effect {{dependence}} {{was observed}} when <b>wet</b> <b>application</b> methods were used, {{although there was}} a statistically significant difference between experimental and control vessels. This agrees with previous reports showing that the application of 0.5, 1 and 2 g/kg dm TiO 2 induces statistically significant but not concentration-dependent effects on microbial soil respiration[7]. Stock TiO 2 concentrations of up to 20 g/L were used in the investigation discussed above[7]. McShane et al.[5] avoided this by using an application method based on the required nanoparticle concentration in the soil. TiO 2 dispersions were used only for soil concentrations up to 200 mg/kg. The maximum concentration in the aqueous stock suspension was 600 mg/L. Higher test concentrations were achieved by the dry application of TiO 2, which was justified by the physical limitations of the dispersion method (i.e. the large amounts of nanomaterials needed to create the dispersions with nominal concentrations ≥ 1000 mg/kg[5]).|$|E

Both dry (incorporated onto the top soil) and <b>wet</b> clay <b>applications</b> (after dispersion in irrigation water) were examined in a replicated experiment, with control trees being used for comparison. The application rate of the clayey soil was maintained in both cases (wet and dry mode) equal to 1 [*]kg[*]m− 2, while the effect of subsequent wetting and drying cycles on the treatment performance was evaluated. The results of the study verify that clay application was effective to mitigate soil water repellency. Dry supplementation displayed low efficiency (26 % reduction of the air-dry WDPT compared with the control soil) within the first week of application. The efficiency of the dry-clay treatment increased to 76 % after applying three subsequent wetting and drying cycles. In comparison with the dry mode, the wet clay was efficient immediately after application (74 % reduction of the WDPT), indicating that the limiting step in the overall process was clay dispersion.

30|$|We {{compared}} dry and wet spiking using {{water as}} dispersant. Our results clearly {{show that the}} application method can affect the ecotoxicological impact of nanomaterials, and that wet spiking can cause stronger effects than dry spiking. The <b>wet</b> <b>application</b> of 10 mg/kg nanoparticles resulted in a statistically-significant differences to the control in the plant test, whereas the dry spiking approach did not. We used 10 and 20 mg/kg TiO 2 concentrations for wet spiking in the earthworm tests, and the stimulatory effect was comparable to or higher than that obtained for the lowest concentration used for dry spiking (50 mg/kg). The differences in the bioavailability of the test substance may therefore reflect the different agglomeration and sorption behavior of the nanomaterial under dry and wet spiking conditions. The characterization of nanomaterials in soil is still an important field of research {{and the state of}} the art has been recently reviewed[27, 28]. Unless we are able to characterize nanomaterials in soil, it may be difficult to explain their differing effects and to interpret the results of spiking studies.|$|E

30|$|However, few {{research}} {{studies have been}} concerned to surface <b>wetting</b> <b>application.</b> One interest point in our current research is to observe the effect of light adsorption on surface materials {{with respect to their}} wetting properties particularly of the Fe 2 O 3 :TiO 2 /SiO 2 composites; this topic has attracted significant scientific attention particularly for biological systems. A method for the fabrication of thin films using sol-gel is the dip coating procedure, and it is an appropriate technique to obtain TiO 2 [3], Fe 2 O 3 :TiO 2 [4], and TiO 2 /SiO 2 [5], among others. This method has some advantages, for example, low investment cost for production facilities, large variety of coating materials, and high uniformity on large coating areas. Furthermore, an additional advantage of this technique is the fact that both sides of the substrate can be coated simultaneously. The versatility of this technique allows us to control the vertical dipping velocity, which is very important in the wetness of the forming layer and in the gelation of the layer by the solvent evaporation in order to get uniformity in the film thickness. The α-Fe 2 O 3 has the important feature of absorbing {{a large part of the}} visible solar light due to its energy bandgap of 2.1  eV [6]. Its chemical stability, no toxicity, abundance in nature, and low cost-effective features make it a good material candidate for applications in many fields.|$|R
40|$|Synergistic effect between {{corrosion}} {{and wear}} {{has been widely}} recognized in many tribo-corrosion systems. In most <b>wet</b> <b>application</b> conditions, dissolved oxygen (DO) is a controlling factor to the dynamics of corrosion process and is therefore expected to have {{significant impact on the}} tribo-corrosion performance of materials. In this study, the effect of DO (0 - 24 ppm) on erosion-corrosion behaviour of En 30 B low alloy steel has been investigated using a slurry pot erosion-corrosion test apparatus in a slurry containing 35 wt% silica sand and 3. 5 % NaCl solution at 30 °C and 45 °C. The synergistic effect and its contributing components, i. e., erosion-enhanced corrosion and corrosion-enhanced erosion, have been measured/analysed. The total erosion-corrosion loss and synergy of the En 30 B steel increases with DO in the slurry, initially rapidly at DO levels below ~ 5 ppm and then less rapidly at the higher DO levels. The synergistic effect is mainly due to corrosion-enhanced erosion with negligible contributions from erosion-enhanced corrosion. Temperature has a significant effect on the total erosion-corrosion loss. Total erosion-corrosion was 34 % higher at 45 °C (in still air) than at 30 °C. Mechanisms for the observed phenomena have been discussed based on the concept of corrosion-accelerated micro-crack propagation...|$|E
40|$|Based {{on results}} of {{preceding}} research and development, thin gas barriers {{were made by}} <b>wet</b> <b>application</b> of perhydropolysilazane solution onto polymer films and its subsequent photo-initiated conversion to dense silica layers applying vacuum ultraviolet irradiation. Compared {{to the state of}} the art, these layers were sufficiently improved and characterized by spectroscopic methods, by scanning electron microscopy and by gas permeation measurements. Water vapor transmission rates (WVTR) below 10 − 2 g m− 2 d− 1 were achieved. In this way, single barrier films were developed and produced on a pilot plant from roll to roll, 250 mm wide, at speeds up to 10 m min− 1. Two films were laminated using adhesives curable with ultraviolet (UV) light and evaluated by peel tests, gas permeation measurement and climate testing. It could be shown that the described high-barrier laminates which exhibit WVTR ≈ 5 × 10 − 4 g m− 2 d− 1, determined by the calcium mirror method, are suitable for encapsulation of flexible thin-film photovoltaic modules. Durability of the encapsulated modules could be verified in several climate tests including damp-heat, thermo-cycle (heating, freezing, wetting) and UV exposures which are equivalent to more than 20 years of endurance at outdoor conditions in temperate climate.

40|$|Boron {{biocides}} {{belong to}} {{the most frequently used}} ingredients of commercial wood preservatives. They are very effective fungicides and insecticides, but they do not react with wood and thus leach from it in <b>wet</b> <b>applications.</b> This fact signifi cantly limits use of boron compounds in the field of wood preservation. In order to reduce leaching of boric acid, the emulsion of polyethylene (WE 1) and an emulsion of oxidized polyethylene (WE 6) wax were combined with boric acid (cB = 0. 1 % or 0. 5 % of boron). Spruce wood specimens were vacuum impregnated and afterwards leached according to the prCEN/TS 15119 - 1, EN 1250 - 2 and EN 84 procedures. The results showed that the boron leaching is predominantly infl uenced by moisture content of wood during leaching, and furthermore by the concentration gradient (frequency of water replacement). The fact that the prCEN/TS 15119 - 1 leaching procedure is less severe than other two methods is also refl ected in the results. The results of the EN 84 and ENV 1250 test are comparable, while the results of the prCEN/TS 15119 - 1 testing are not in line with the other two methods. Considerable portions of boron are leached from wood in the first leaching cycles, already.
