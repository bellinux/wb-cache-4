25|$|At this point, {{the thread}} is woven. Depending on the era, one person could manage {{anywhere}} from 3 to 100 machines. In the mid nineteenth century, four was the standard number. A skilled weaver in 1925 would run 6 Lancashire Looms. As time progressed new mechanisms were added that stopped the loom any time something went wrong. The mechanisms checked {{for such things}} as a broken <b>warp</b> <b>thread,</b> broken weft thread, the shuttle going straight across, and if the shuttle was empty. Forty of these Northrop Looms or automatic looms could be operated by one skilled worker.|$|E
25|$|Weaving cotton {{requires}} humid {{conditions and}} cotton {{needed to be}} sized, strands of <b>warp</b> <b>thread</b> were coated {{with a layer of}} paste to prevent chafing against the healds and reeds in the batten. If the size hardened it broke the thread. Loomshops were built in the basement or on the ground floor. The weavers kept the floor beneath the loom moist, sometimes by digging channels into the clay floor and pouring in water. The loomshop was entered through the family accommodation so humidity was not lost to the outside. In such a cottage, one ground floor room became the manufactory, and the family lived in the other, a kitchen living room. Sometimes a basement was excavated beneath the family home lit by elongated windows. The term 'cellar loomshop' was used for both ground floor and basement establishments.|$|E

There are two set of <b>warp</b> <b>thread,</b> right twist and left twist,- one used for {{stability}} and the other used for twisting.|$|E
50|$|Split {{tapestry}} weave - {{the simplest}} weave where two weft threads are woven up to adjacent <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> and then reversed. The <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> are then cut and retied {{to a different}} colour.|$|R
50|$|Sleying is {{the term}} used for pulling the <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> through the loom, which happens in the warping process (the process of putting a warp on the loom). Sleying is done by {{inserting}} a reed hook through the reed, hooking the <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> and then pulling them through the dent. The <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> are taken in the order {{they come from the}} heddles, so as to avoid crossing threads. If the threads cross, the shed will not open correctly when the weaving is begun.|$|R
5000|$|In basketweave, {{groups of}} <b>warp</b> and weft <b>threads</b> are {{interlaced}} {{so that they}} form a simple criss-cross pattern. Each group of weft threads crosses {{an equal number of}} <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> by going over one group, then under the next, and so on. The next group of weft threads goes under the <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> that its neighbor went over, and vice versa.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A satin weave, {{common for}} silk, each <b>warp</b> <b>thread</b> floats over 16 weft threads.|$|E
50|$|Most weavers use {{a natural}} <b>warp</b> <b>thread,</b> such as linen or cotton. The weft threads are usually wool or cotton, but may include silk, gold, silver, or other alternatives.|$|E
5000|$|A drawloom is a hand-loom for weaving figured cloth. In a drawloom, a [...] "figure harness" [...] is used {{to control}} each <b>warp</b> <b>thread</b> separately. A drawloom {{requires}} two operators, the weaver and an assistant called a [...] "drawboy" [...] to manage the figure harness.|$|E
50|$|Thread fringe, {{untwisted}} and unbraided loose <b>warp</b> <b>threads.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{straight}} grain is oriented {{parallel with the}} <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> and the selvedge. The {{straight grain}} typically has less stretch than the crossgrain since the <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> will be pulled tighter than the weft during weaving. Most garments are cut with the straight grain oriented top to bottom.|$|R
50|$|The warp {{is sized}} in a starch mixture for {{smoother}} running. The loom warped (loomed or dressed) by passing the sized <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> through {{two or more}} heddles attached to harnesses. The power weavers loom is warped by separate workers. Most looms used for industrial purposes have a machine that ties new <b>warps</b> <b>threads</b> to the waste of previously used <b>warps</b> <b>threads,</b> while still on the loom, then an operator rolls {{the old and new}} threads back on the warp beam. The harnesses are controlled by cams, dobbies or a Jacquard head.|$|R
5000|$|A Dobby loom {{is a type}} {{of floor}} loom that {{controls}} all the warp threads using a device called a dobby. (The word dobby is a corruption of [...] "draw boy" [...] which refers to the weaver's helpers who used to control the <b>warp</b> <b>thread</b> by pulling on draw threads.) A dobby loom is an alternative to a treadle loom. Both are floor looms in which every <b>warp</b> <b>thread</b> on the loom is attached to a single shaft using a device called a heddle. A shaft is sometimes known as a harness. Each shaft controls a set of threads. Raising or lowering several shafts at the same time gives a huge variety of possible sheds (gaps) through which the shuttle containing the weft thread can be thrown.|$|E
50|$|Mono canvas {{comes in}} the widest variety of colors (especially 18 mesh) and is plain woven, with one weft thread going over and under one <b>warp</b> <b>thread.</b> This canvas has the most {{possibilities}} for manipulation and open canvas. It is used for hand-painted canvases as well as counted thread canvaswork.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, extra <b>warp</b> <b>thread</b> can be {{wound around}} the weights. When a weaver {{has reached the}} bottom of the {{available}} warp, the completed section can be rolled around the top beam, and additional lengths of warp threads can be unwound from the weights to continue. This frees the weaver from vertical size constraints.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are other}} more {{advanced}} techniques in which, instead of merely allowing <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> to alternate in their {{up or down}} positions, individual threads are brought to the surface to form {{what is called a}} [...] "pick up" [...] pattern. One side of the band will show the exposed surfaces of <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> while, {{on the other side of}} the pattern, the weft thread will be visible. Using a supplemental weft thread that will come up over the top of certain <b>warp</b> <b>threads,</b> brocaded designs can also be worked into the inkle band.|$|R
50|$|When weaving on a loom, {{the beads}} {{are locked in}} between the <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> by the weft threads. The most common bead weaving {{technique}} requires two passes of the weft thread. First, an entire row of beads is strung on the weft thread. Then the beads are pressed in between the <b>warp</b> <b>threads.</b> The needle is passed back through the beads above the <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> to lock the beads into place. Heddle looms were popular {{near the beginning of}} the 20th century. They allowed weaving of beads by raising every other thread and inserting strung beads in the shed, the space between the lowered and raised threads. There are still a few Heddle Bead Looms being manufactured today. The most difficult part of loomwork is finishing off the <b>warp</b> <b>threads.</b>|$|R
40|$|As {{described}} in the previous article in this series [1], {{the first step toward}} getting a sound draft for a problem pattern is to assign colors to its <b>warp</b> and weft <b>threads.</b> Consider this simple twill: To start, a color needs to be assigned to some thread. Suppose the first weft thread is white: W This choice has immediate implications. To satisfy the pattern, the first and second <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> must be black: These colors are forced: W B B The black <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> in turn force the rest of the weft threads to be white, and these force the rest of the <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> to be black:...|$|R
5000|$|The Ikat {{technique}} (also called [...] "chong kiet" [...] in Khmer) {{is one of}} {{the most}} ancient weaving techniques in the world and is used to create designs in fabrics. Artisans create a tight knot resistant to dyes which forms an original pattern with the complex intertwining of the <b>warp</b> <b>thread</b> and the weft thread.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of tulle is actually bobbinet, invented in Britain {{in the early}} 19th century. Bobbinet is made by wrapping the weft thread around the <b>warp</b> <b>thread,</b> creating a strong hexagonal design which tends not to twist or fall out of shape, because the wrapped threads maintain a state of tension. The result is tulle netting which is lightweight and surprisingly strong and durable for its weight.|$|E
50|$|In general, weaving {{involves}} using a loom {{to interlace}} {{two sets of}} threads {{at right angles to}} each other: the warp which runs longitudinally and the weft (older woof) that crosses it. One <b>warp</b> <b>thread</b> is called an end and one weft thread is called a pick. The warp threads are held taut and in parallel to each other, typically in a loom. There are many types of looms.|$|E
5000|$|In plain weave, {{the warp}} and weft are aligned so they form a simple {{criss-cross}} pattern. Each weft <b>thread</b> crosses the <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> by going over one, then under the next, and so on. The next weft thread goes under the <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> that its neighbor went over, and vice versa.|$|R
50|$|It has two warp beams, {{though it}} can be run using just one or none. An S-twist thread is out on the front warp (right warp) and a Z- twist on the back warp (left warp, reverse warp). All the warp ends pass through a sley with {{individual}} perforations- to keep the threads from tangling.On a machine with 3000 front warp ends, that will mean 6000 perforations, all front warp ends will be of the same count, and all back warp ends will be of the same count, though the two warps can carry different counts. The <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> interact with the brass bobbin threads to form the net or openwork ground. The reverse <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> (introduced in 1830) lock the front <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> against the bobbin <b>threads.</b> The <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> are tensioned by a spring.|$|R
50|$|A simple {{raising and}} {{lowering}} of threads creates a plain-weave band in which <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> are slightly offset. Weft threads are only visible {{at the edges}} of the band and the weaver may wish to take this into account by <b>warping</b> <b>threads</b> that will form the edges in the same color as the weft.|$|R
5000|$|A {{dobby loom}} {{is a type}} of floor loom that {{controls}} the whole warp threads using a dobby head. Dobby is a corruption of [...] "draw boy" [...] which refers to the weaver's helpers who used to control the <b>warp</b> <b>thread</b> by pulling on draw threads. A dobby loom is an alternative to a treadle loom, where multiple heddles (shafts) were controlled by foot treadles - one for each heddle.|$|E
5000|$|Patterns {{result from}} a {{combination}} of the warp dye and the weft thread colour. Some warp ikat traditions are designed with vertical-axis symmetry or have a [...] "mirror-image" [...] running along their long centre line. That is, whatever pattern or design is woven on the right is duplicated on the left in reverse order about a central <b>warp</b> <b>thread</b> group. Patterns can be created in the vertical, horizontal or diagonal.|$|E
50|$|The {{invention}} in France of the Jacquard loom {{in about}} 1803, enabled complicated patterned cloths to be woven, by using punched cards {{to determine which}} threads of coloured yarn should appear on the upper side of the cloth. The jacquard allowed individual control of each <b>warp</b> <b>thread,</b> row by row without repeating, so very complex patterns were suddenly feasible. Samples exist showing calligraphy, and woven copies of engravings. Jacquards could be attached to handlooms or powerlooms.|$|E
50|$|The {{black and}} white cotton <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> first need to be wound onto the loom. This is done in 64m lengths, and the threads are wound onto the back beam of the loom. The <b>warp</b> has 60 <b>threads</b> per inch and is {{approximately}} 20 inches wide, each thread needs to be threaded through a heddle {{in the middle of}} the loom, and then through the reed at the front of the loom. This threading process is done by hand using a threading hook. Once the machine is <b>threaded</b> up, the <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> are secured at the front of the loom onto the front beam. The loom then needs to be calibrated to advance the <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> at the correct speed to weave 84 threads per inch.|$|R
2500|$|Shedding: The {{operation}} of dividing the warp into two lines, {{so that the}} shuttle can pass between these lines. There are two general kinds of sheds-"open" [...] and [...] "closed." [...] Open Shed-The <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> are moved when the pattern requires it-from one line to the other. Closed Shed-The <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> are all placed level in one line after each pick.|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} denim is indigo denim, {{in which the}} <b>warp</b> <b>thread</b> is dyed, while the weft thread is left white. As {{a result of the}} warp-faced twill weaving, one side of the textile is {{dominated}} by the blue warp threads and the other side is dominated by the white weft threads. This causes blue jeans to be white on the inside. The indigo dyeing process, in which the core of the warp threads remains white, creates denim's signature fading characteristics.|$|E
50|$|Hitoe obi ("one-layer obi") is {{made from}} silk cloth so stiff that the obi does not need lining or sewn-in stiffeners. One of these cloth types is called Hakataori (博多織), which {{consists}} of thick weft thread interwoven with thin <b>warp</b> <b>thread</b> with a stiff, tight weave; obi made from this material are also called Hakata obi (博多帯). A hitoe obi can be worn with everyday kimono or yukata. A hitoe obi is 15 cm to 20 cm wide (the so-called hanhaba obi) or 30 cm wide and about 400 cm long.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the weaving}} commences, the warp threads will shorten on the loom and the weaver {{will need to}} adjust the tension periodically. As the inkle band progresses, it will also {{get closer to the}} heddles. The weaver will also need to advance the <b>warp</b> <b>thread</b> along the bottom of the loom to open up new weaving space. In her book [...] "Inkle Weaving," [...] Helene Bress {{recommends}} loosening the tension when you are ready to advance the warp. Once you have done so, tighten the tension again and resume your weaving.|$|E

50|$|In {{general the}} {{supporting}} {{structure of the}} loom is called the frame. It provides the means of fixing the length-wise <b>threads,</b> called the <b>warp,</b> and keeping them under tension. The <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> are wound on a roller called the warp beam, and attached to the cloth beam which will hold the finished material. Because of the tension the <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> are under, {{they need to be}} strong.|$|R
50|$|The {{technique}} involves wrapping coloured weft threads {{over and}} under the <b>warp</b> <b>threads,</b> adding strength and embroidery-like pattern.|$|R
