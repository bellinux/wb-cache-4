During this process, <b>alternating</b> <b>forces</b> in hydraulic pumps incite vibrations in the pump case and {{are responsible for}} the structure-borne noise. Mainly dynamic forces in bearings are the source causing structure-borne noise which generates finally air-borne noise. For this reason, those dynamic forces have been investigated based on a dynamical model. The structure borne noise has been measured on the pump case surface. The natural vibrations of the pump case have been determined by the Finite Element Method for several boundary conditions. The comparison between calculated and measured natural vibrations indicates that the coupling of the pump parts influences the dynamic behaviour of the case...|$|R

The harmonic and quartic anharmonic terms produce intrinsic localized modes with frequencies above the optical branch and in the gap.

25|$|In {{a dynamic}} sense, the {{response}} of a gel to an <b>alternating</b> <b>force</b> (oscillation or vibration) will depend upon the period or frequency of vibration. As indicated here, even most simple liquids will exhibit some elastic response at shear rates or frequencies exceeding 5 x 106 cycles per second. Experiments on such short time scales probe the fundamental motions of the primary particles (or particle clusters) which constitute the lattice structure or aggregate. The increasing resistance of certain liquids to flow at high stirring speeds is one manifestation of this phenomenon. The ability of a condensed body {{to respond to a}} mechanical force by viscous flow is thus strongly dependent on the time scale over which the load is applied, and thus the frequency and amplitude of the stress wave in oscillatory experiments.|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} {{theoretical}} study of an overdamped Brownian particle dynamics {{in the presence}} of both a spatially modulated one-dimensional periodic potential and a periodic <b>alternating</b> <b>force</b> (AF). As the periodic potential has a low symmetry (a ratchet potential) the Brownian particle displays a broken symmetry motion with a nonzero time average velocity. By making use of the Green function method and a mapping to the theory of Brillouin bands the probability distribution of the particle coordinate is derived and the nonlinear dependence of the macroscopic velocity on the frequency and the amplitude of AF is found. In particular, our theory allows to go beyond the adiabatic limit and to explain the peculiar reversal of the velocity sign found previously in the numerical analysis.
