50|$|The Rainforest {{fills the}} entire {{north-east}} corner, about two-fifths of the frontage to Range Street {{and all the}} frontage along Mackenzie Street. The rainforest contains only native trees, shrubs, climbers and ferns. There are several varieties of fig, Queensland Lace Bark and other Brachychitons, Lilli Pilli, Red Cedar, Deep Yellow <b>Wood,</b> <b>Ribbon</b> Wood, Hoop Pine, Silky Oak. There are also Birds Nest Ferns, tree ferns and many varieties of ground fern.|$|E
50|$|The square {{has been}} {{covered in a}} skin of blue paving slabs, made by mixing crushed blue glass with resin. At the points where this skin reaches a {{building}} the slabs curve upwards to create the sensation that the tiles are a fabric laid over the area. There {{are a number of}} benches that appear to fold up from the carpet surface, and beneath the benches are sunken glass-topped boxes that hold coloured lights. At the eastern end an existing staircase, leading to an elevated walkway, was replaced with a new one, featuring a curving skin of <b>wood</b> <b>ribbons,</b> constructed by a local boatbuilder.|$|R
50|$|The Council of Lenape Elders {{works to}} sustain {{traditional}} dances, culture, and the tribal language {{and works with}} the Delaware Gourd Society. The tribe maintains a Delaware Center, on a 80 acre parcel land in Bartlesville. Delaware artists {{are known for their}} <b>wood</b> carving and <b>ribbon</b> work skills.|$|R
40|$|FRED (London) {{is delighted}} to have this {{opportunity}} to present an exhibition in celebration of Collage. Co-curated with Pavel Zoubok Gallery, New York, this joint-exhibition provides a platform for contemporary American artists to show in London, many for the first time, alongside leading European artists represented by FRED. Both galleries have also brought together works {{by some of the}} foremost practitioners in Twentieth century Western art. The exhibition creates a unique grouping of work from this exciting field. The exhibition features some sixty-nine artists from the last one hundred years, each working in very different ways, but all incorporating collage in its various forms into their practice. Historical figures including Marcel Duchamp, Joseph Cornell, Robert Motherwell, Ben Nicholson, Jacques Villeglé and Andy Warhol hang alongside contemporary practitioners such as Nora Aslan, John Evans, Ion Birladeanu, Nayland Blake, Ansuya Blom, Brice Brown, Jay Cloth, Dan Coombs, Ian Dawson, India Evans, Gilbert and George, Marcus Harvey, Susan Hiller, John Jodzio, Don Joint, Chantal Joffe, Grayson Perry, Maritta Tapanainen and Mark Wagner. For some, collage is an elemental driver in their methodology, but for others it is incidental or experimental, and has been included because it pushes at the edge of what it is that we accept the technique to be. There is a full list of the contributing artists on the following page. Collage was pioneered by George Braque and Pablo Picasso {{in the early part of}} the last century, and derives from the French word coller, meaning to glue or paste. What we now readily accept as collage goes back hundreds of years, but it made a dramatic resurgence in the early part of the twentieth century and went from a form of novelty to one with a distinctive place in Modernist art. Made from an assemblage of different materials and forms, it is a work of formal art made from clippings and cuttings of paper, fabric, <b>wood,</b> <b>ribbons,</b> bits of photographs, printed material or found objects that have been stuck to a surface with purpose, and an element of incongruity, in their new juxtapositions and re-contextualisations. In this technological age, where the making of digital images is ubiquitous and their manipulation widespread, collage continuous to hold its important place in the making of, and our understanding of, contemporary art...|$|R
5000|$|In fall 2011, {{with funding}} from the Iksan Tax Office and Nexelon (solar cell manufacturer), the Mireuksan Circumferential path (미륵산 둘레길) was opened, {{providing}} an alternative activity to simply ascending to the summit. Via this new path one may circle the entire mountain around its base, on small footpaths or small one lane village lanes {{over the course of}} approximately 16-18 km dependent on which trails one selects along the way. The route offers new views of the surrounding areas with newly installed signage, indicating distances and destinations, though only in Hangeul. In addition to the <b>wood</b> signs, yellow <b>ribbons</b> bearing [...] "미륵산둘레길" [...] guide the way over the newer sections of trail. Granite obelisks bearing an illustration of a snail (representing the ideal of [...] "taking it slow") have been installed at certain turnpoints of the trail in late 2012.|$|R
40|$|Wood is a {{very popular}} and {{preferred}} material for many applications because of its remarkable decorative peculiarities. A very interesting feature related to the appearance of <b>wood</b> is called <b>ribbon</b> stripe or stripe figure. Stripe figure {{is perceived as a}} series of longitudinal parallel stripes which alternate in colour shade. When the sample is slightly rotated, the bright stripes become dark and vice versa. This gonio-apparent effect provides the wood with a very dynamic appearance, distinguishing the material from alternatives such as laminate. In this paper, stripe figure is quantified by measuring and analyzing the absolute spectral bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) for different incident and viewing angle combinations. In a first step, perpendicular illumination is used and the viewing angle is varied in four half planes. Asymmetric BRDF values are found if the observation plane is parallel with the ribbon direction, in contrast to the behaviour in the plane perpendicular to it. In a second experiment, both incident and viewing angle are changed simultaneously, simulating the general observer behaviour when assessing the appearance of the sample. Important differences in lightness between two adjacent positions on the sample are recorded when slightly rotating the sample around an axis perpendicular to the ribbon pattern, revealing the characteristic contrast flop. Again, if the other rotation direction is chosen, almost no variation is observed. These observations {{can be attributed to the}} particular orientation of the fibres in combination with the external reflectance at the finishing top layer. Analogous effects are present in the hue, especially on the yellow-blue axis, but are almost absent on the red-green axis. The quantitative results reported in this paper can be used for camera-based selection of wood samples and to improve the quality of computer renderings of these natural materials. status: publishe...|$|R
