40|$|Single sided etching is {{commonly}} used for processing solar cells. As with all single sided processes using wet etching solutions, fluid <b>wrap</b> <b>around</b> appears. This paper investigates this effect in two ways. Different experimental setups will be shown and described including results and theories concerning the fluid <b>wrap</b> <b>around.</b> It can be proven, that bursting bubbles caused by etching support the fluid <b>wrap</b> <b>around</b> {{as well as some}} additives and surface morphologies. Additionally, surface tension, surface energy and surface morphologies can be found as influencing factors.

5|$|The banded sugar ant (Camponotus consobrinus), {{also known}} as the sugar ant, is a species of ant endemic to Australia. A member of the genus Camponotus in the {{subfamily}} Formicinae, it was described by German entomologist Wilhelm Ferdinand Erichson in 1842. Its common name refers to the ant's liking for sugar and sweet food, as well as the distinctive orange-brown band that <b>wraps</b> <b>around</b> its gaster.|$|E

The subdivision rules show what the night sky would look like to someone living in a knot complement; because the universe <b>wraps</b> <b>around</b> itself (i.e. is not simply connected), an observer would see the visible universe repeat itself in an infinite pattern. The subdivision rule describes that pattern.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{invasive}} plants live {{along the}} Saw Mill River. Porcelain berry is a vine with white berries that <b>wraps</b> <b>around</b> native trees and strangles them. Oriental bittersweet is also present along the river, {{and it is}} slowly displacing the native American bittersweet. Oriental bitterweet can also form hybrids with the native bittersweet and making identification harder. Japanese honeysuckle and Japanese knotweed are two other invasive vines native to Asia. In addition, purple loosestrife, a perennial herb with magenta flower stalks, is also present along the river.|$|E
5|$|A {{second major}} cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality in the North Atlantic right whale is entanglement in fishing gear. Right whales ingest plankton with wide-open mouths, risking entanglement in any rope or net fixed in the water column. Rope <b>wraps</b> <b>around</b> their upper jaws, flippers and tails. Some are able to escape, but others remain tangled. Whales can be successfully disentangled, if observed and aided. In July 1997, the U.S. NOAA introduced the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan, which seeks to minimize whale entanglement in fishing gear and record large whale sightings in an attempt to estimate numbers and distribution.|$|E

In other instances, bands can <b>wrap</b> <b>around</b> limbs causing restriction of movement resulting in clubbed feet. In more severe cases, the bands can constrict the limb causing decreased blood supply and amputation. Amniotic bands can also sometimes attach to the face or neck causing deformities such as cleft lip and palate.

From there, it travels straight through Burlington and Oakville with the QEW, departing to the north at the Mississauga–Oakville boundary. The freeway then crosses through the centre of Mississauga in an east–west direction, serving its city centre, before turning north. It continues north of Highway401 as Highway410 to Brampton.|$|E
5|$|Comcast's {{office space}} was {{designed}} by Daroff Design + DDI Architects and Gensler. Comcast's space is topped by a conference room floor with the executive offices on the four floors below it. Below that are more offices and then, on the 43rd and 44th floors, is Ralph's Cafe, a two-story cafeteria space named after the company founder Ralph J. Roberts. Below the cafe is the training center called Comcast University. The rest of the space is used for content and programing teams, customer service, Technology & Product teams, Finance and Legal. The interior design of the offices are designed {{with a variety of}} shape and color ranging from the open white space of the upper offices to the colorful walls of the training center. Other designs include a glass and stainless steel staircase that <b>wraps</b> <b>around</b> a four-story column of flat-screen monitors and connects the executive floors.|$|E
5|$|The cone shaped fruiting body of Cyathus striatus {{makes use}} of a splash-cup {{mechanism}} to help disperse the spores. When a raindrop hits {{the interior of the}} cup with the optimal angle and velocity, the downward force of the water ejects the peridioles into the air. The force of ejection rips open the funiculus, releasing the tightly wound funicular cord. The hapteron attached {{to the end of the}} funiculus is adhesive, and when it contacts a nearby plant stem or stick, the hapteron sticks to it; the funicular cord <b>wraps</b> <b>around</b> the stem or stick powered by the force of the still-moving peridiole (similar to a tetherball). The peridioles degrade over time to eventually release the spores within, or they may be eaten by herbivorous animals and redeposited after passing through the digestive tract.|$|E

5|$|The lower seating bowl {{is divided}} into 24 {{sections}} and <b>wraps</b> <b>around</b> the playing field from one foul pole to the other. The second level has 16sections of seating that begin behind third base and wrap around to first base. The last nine rows, from row M, on the first level between the dugouts are sheltered by the upper deck. Seats on both levels are traditional, plastic stadium-style chairs. All lower-level seats behind home plate, seats behind and between the dugouts through row P, and all second-level seats have padded seat cushions. Seats in the three center upper-deck sections behind home plate and all second-level suites also have padded seat backs. A grass berm that can accommodate 1,500spectators is located beyond the left-center field wall.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the thornback guitarfish is heart-shaped, slightly {{longer than it}} is wide, and thick towards the front. The snout is short and broad, with a blunt tip protruding slightly from the disc. The eyes are small and widely spaced; the spiracles are larger than the eyes and lie closely behind. The wide nostrils are preceded by moderately large, broad flaps of skin. The mouth is wide and gently arched; there are a pair of creases running from the mouth corners to the nostrils, enclosing a roughly trapezoidal area. The lower lip is inscribed by a deep furrow that <b>wraps</b> <b>around</b> the mouth corners. The small teeth have low crowns that may be sharp to blunt, and are arranged in 68–82 rows in the upper jaw and 64–78 rows in the lower jaw. The five pairs of gill slits are small and located beneath the disc.|$|E
5|$|When a drop {{of falling}} water hits the {{interior}} of the cup with the appropriate angle and velocity, the peridioles are ejected into the air by the force of the drop. The force of ejection tears open the purse, and results in the expansion of the funicular cord, formerly coiled under pressure in {{the lower part of the}} purse. The peridioles, followed by the highly adhesive funicular cord and basal hapteron, may hit a nearby plant stem or stick. The hapteron sticks to it, and the funicular cord <b>wraps</b> <b>around</b> the stem or stick powered by the force of the still-moving peridiole. After drying out, the peridiole remains attached to the vegetation, where it may be eaten by a grazing herbivorous animal, and later deposited in that animal's dung to continue the life cycle.|$|E

5|$|When a {{raindrop}} {{hits the}} interior of the cup with the proper angle and velocity it can produce considerable force, and can create a splash that drives the water up along the sides of the cup (also known as splash cups), tearing the funiculus, and ejecting the peridioles. The peridioles are followed by their funicular cord and basal hapteron. When they hit a nearby plant stem or stick, the hapteron sticks to it, and the funicular cord <b>wraps</b> <b>around</b> the stem or stick powered by the force of the still-moving peridiole (similar to a tetherball). The peridiole, attached to the plant, may be eaten by herbivorous mammals, and the subsequent passage through its digestive tract will soften the hard shell enough to facilitate later sporulation.|$|E
5|$|Astaroth {{is shown}} to be a large, muscular, bald, dark-skinned {{humanoid}} with solid white eyes. A black mask <b>wraps</b> <b>around</b> and covers the lower portion of his head, while a black open gorget covers the nape of his neck and spiked spaulders cover his shoulders. Black spiked braces and boots cover his hands to the elbows and feet to the knees respectively, and black garters wrap around the middle of each thigh. A large black belt surrounds his abdomen supporting a fauld and cloth loincloth.s character creation mode, in which they exist as components of Astaroth's secondary outfit Two black straps of leather crisscross the vertical center of his chest from the gorget to the belt, in between which lies his exposed, protruding heart.

Astaroth stands 7 feet 3 inches tall, making him the largest character with a recorded height in the series.|$|E
5|$|Female banded sugar ants {{are easily}} {{recognised}} by their black head, orange thorax and the orange-brown band that <b>wraps</b> <b>around</b> their gaster. Males {{of the species}} are completely black. The dark sides of the thorax and legs are ferruginous (rusty in colour). The scape (the base of the antenna) and mandibles are black, and the head is wider than the thorax. The thorax is longer than its total width and slightly compressed, and the gaster is covered with tiny black dots. Erect setae are golden in colour and absent under the head but present on the mesosoma. The setae on the tibia and scape are shorter than those on the mesosoma. The anterior of the gaster is lighter in colour compared to the posterior, and the dorsum of the mesosoma is outlined and curved. A worker's metanotum is absent and the eyes are bulging, while a soldier's metanotum is noticeable and the eyes are flat. The wings on the queen are dark, and the stigmata and nerves are yellow. While many ant species have a metapleural gland, the gland is not present in the banded sugar ant; the number of malpighian tubules in workers is 21.|$|E
