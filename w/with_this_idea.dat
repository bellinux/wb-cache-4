5|$|With Irvine, Nomura {{tried to}} strike a balance between not overshadowing Squall and not {{becoming}} too unattractive. He gave Irvine a handsome appearance, but a casual personality, hoping that this would make him less attractive than Squall. Keeping <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>idea,</b> Nomura gave him goggles; however, this idea was abandoned in favor of an American cowboy-like appearance to set him apart from other goggle-wearing characters in the Final Fantasy series.|$|E
25|$|Some LDS {{scholars}} {{identify the}} Olmec civilization with the Jaredites, citing similarities and {{noting that the}} period in which the Olmecs flourished and later declined corresponds roughly with the Jaredite civilization timeline, although most disagree <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>idea.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Silmarillion, like Tolkien's other Middle-earth writings, {{was meant}} {{to have taken place}} at some time in Earth's past. In keeping <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>idea,</b> The Silmarillion is meant to have been {{translated}} from Bilbo's three-volume Translations from the Elvish, which he wrote while at Rivendell.|$|E

5000|$|Mary was {{identified}} as the [...] "New Eve" [...] {{as early as the}} later half of the Second Century. Justin Martyr (100-165) draws the connection in his Dialogue <b>with</b> Trypho. <b>This</b> <b>idea</b> is later expanded by Irenaeus.|$|R

25|$|A recent genetic {{study of}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA is consistent <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>idea.</b> Greenlandic white-tailed eagles form, on evolutionary time scales, a relatively recently founded population {{that has not}} yet accumulated many unique genetic characteristics. However, the population appears to be demographically isolated and deserves special protection.|$|E
25|$|Dobson and Ramlogan’s {{research}} {{looked to}} identify the relationship between inequality and trade liberalization. There have been mixed findings <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>idea</b> – some developing countries have experienced greater inequality, less inequality, or no difference at all, due to trade liberalization. Because of this, Dobson and Ramlogan suggest that perhaps trade openness {{can be related to}} inequality through a Kuznets curve framework.|$|E
25|$|The {{main problem}} <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>idea</b> is the timing {{at which the}} {{transition}} is presumed to have happened, and how this would then translate into the genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes and obesity. For example, the decline in reproductive investment in human societies (the so-called r to K shift) has occurred far too recently to {{have been caused by}} a change in genetics.|$|E

25|$|Claytronics is an {{abstract}} future concept that combines nanoscale robotics {{and computer science}} to create individual nanometer-scale computers called claytronic atoms, or catoms, which can {{interact with each other}} to form tangible 3D objects that a user can interact <b>with.</b> <b>This</b> <b>idea</b> is more broadly referred to as programmable matter. Claytronics has the potential to greatly affect many areas of daily life, such as telecommunication, human-computer interfaces, and entertainment.|$|E
25|$|According to some {{scientists}} culture {{may be a}} major factor in shaping sleep paralysis. When sleep paralysis is interpreted through a particular cultural filter, it may take on greater salience. For example, if sleep paralysis is feared in a certain culture, this fear could lead to conditioned fear, and thus worsen the experience, in turn leading to higher rates. Consistent <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>idea,</b> high rates and long durations of immobility during sleep paralysis have been found in Egypt, where there are elaborate beliefs about sleep paralysis, involving malevolent spirit-like creatures, the Jinn.|$|E
25|$|Other {{aspects to}} be {{considered}} <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>idea</b> are the adverse effects on aquatic life of the San Juan River, lakes Managua and Colcibolca, the existing flora and fauna {{in the area that}} would be flooded by a proposed dam in the plan, and the environmental impact of the dam construction {{and all of the other}} related works. There is a conflict in the use of water for this irrigation project because the more area that is irrigated, the less water that is available for power generation and drinking water supply.|$|E

25|$|For Marx and Engels, then, {{the ruling}} classes control the {{subordinate}} classes through {{domination of the}} ideas available in the culture. In this way the subordinate classes {{are said to be}} mediated by the effects of ideology, or “false consciousness” or a belief system that doesn’t allow them to see the oppression they are enduring for what it is. The problem <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>idea,</b> as many Marxists have noted, is that it doesn’t leave room for members of the subordinate classes to act on the world around them through alternate forms of mediation.|$|E
25|$|A popular {{notion is}} that people might not share {{extremely}} intense emotional events because they are simply inexpressible. Along <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>idea,</b> psychologists initially hypothesized that the extreme nature of such experiences would {{play an important role}} in determining whether an emotional event is shared or not. Additionally, they thought that people would be motivated not to deliberately revisit such events because they would reactivate the extreme negative emotions that accompanied the events. However, their studies revealed that there was no difference in the average emotional intensity between events that were shared compared to those that were kept secret.|$|E
25|$|Asher {{approached}} several Californian growers <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>idea,</b> {{but most}} were hesitant to take part. The idea became more real when the winemakers Karl Wente and Robert Mondavi agreed to participate. Paul Kovi and Tom Margittai of the prestigious Four Seasons Restaurant in Manhattan agreed to organise the practicalities of such an event in return for Asher's coordination of the California wineries' contributions. The first annual California Vintners Barrel Tasting Dinner was held at The Four Seasons in 1976, and soon became hugely popular; though there were only 228 places available for the 1978 tasting, over 2,000 people tried to buy tickets.|$|E

5000|$|Barak's legal {{philosophy}} {{starts with the}} belief that [...] "the world is filled <b>with</b> law". <b>This</b> <b>idea</b> portrays law as an all-encompassing framework of human affairs from which no action can ever be immune: Whatever the law does not prohibit, it permits; either way, the law always has its say, on everything.|$|R
25|$|There is {{one major}} piece of {{evidence}} suggesting that abnormal connectivity occurs in autism. Autistic brains are known to develop very rapidly early in life, and this could cause problems {{in the development of}} cortical connections. It has been suggested that this early overdevelopment may be a cause for the impaired connectivity in autism. Diffusion tensor imaging studies of autistic brains are consistent <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>idea,</b> as they show reduced myelination (see:Myelin) in the areas of the brain that deal with social cognition and theory of mind, or one’s ability to comprehend what another person may be thinking. This provides further evidence for underconnectivity of the autistic brain.|$|E
25|$|In 1644, Menasseh met Antonio de Montezinos, a Portuguese {{traveler}} and Marrano Sephardic Jew who {{had been}} in the New World. Montezinos convinced him of his conclusion that the South America Andes' Indians were the descendants of the lost ten tribes of Israel. This purported discovery gave a new impulse to Menasseh's Messianic hopes, as the settlement of Jews throughout the world was supposed to be a sign that the Messiah would come. Filled <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>idea,</b> he turned his attention to England, whence the Jews had been expelled since 1290. He worked to get them permission to settle there again and thus hasten the Messiah's coming.|$|E
25|$|Agentic-personal self principle: When identity-fused {{individuals}} become strongly {{aligned with}} a group, they {{are assumed to}} maintain an active and agentic personal self, even when the social self is activated. Consistent <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>idea,</b> activating the personal self by increasing physiological arousal, or encouraging {{people to think about}} how they would react if they were personally threatened, may increase the person's endorsement of extreme pro-group sacrifices. In contrast, the social identification perspective assumes that the personal and social selves are hydraulically related to one another. As such, activating the personal self should diminish endorsement of pro-group behavior. However, {{this was not the case}} for strongly fused individuals, who actually demonstrated the exact opposite effect.|$|E

25|$|It is also {{possible}} that problems with binding give way to the fractured mental state that is characteristic of schizophrenia. Schizophrenic patients experience a “disintegration of consciousness” which involves hallucinations, delusions, and generally disordered thinking. It is hypothesized that this mental disorganization is caused by underlying neural disorganization due to disordered binding, which is then further complicated by the occurrence of complex mental processes in this disordered state. This can essentially be viewed as a pathological rise in the neural complexity of the brain. The dissociative symptoms and disorganized speech associated with schizophrenia are consistent <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>idea.</b> It is {{also possible}} that disordered binding between the regulatory mechanisms of the brain gives rise to a lack of synchronized activation of its neural networks.|$|E
25|$|Filming for Series Four {{commenced}} on Monday 23 February 1981 {{on location}} at Pyrton Hill for {{the scenes in}} Rescue set on the planet Terminal. Location filming for the final episode, Blake, took place between 13 and 15 October 1981. Following rehearsals, recording began in the studio at BBC Television Centre on 5 November 1981. The final shoot-out was recorded on 6 November. Recording on Blake's 7 concluded on Saturday 7 November 1981. A new title sequence, featuring a new logo for the series, was created by Doug Burd. Vere Lorrimer wrote lyrics, titled Distant Star, for the series theme music {{with the notion that}} Steven Pacey would sing them over a new arrangement of the theme by Norrie Paramour. Pacey did not agree <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>idea,</b> and Dudley Simpson created a more lively arrangement of the theme for the closing titles.|$|E
25|$|Many {{students}} {{listen to}} music while they study. Many of these students maintain that the reasons why they {{listen to music}} are to prevent drowsiness and to maintain their arousal for study. Some even believe that background music facilitates better work performance. However, Salame and Baddeley (1989) showed that both vocal and instrumental music interfered with performance of linguistic memory. They explained that disturbance in performance was caused by task-irrelevant phonological information using resources in the working memory system. This disturbance {{can be explained by}} the fact that the linguistic component of music can occupy the phonological loop, similar to the way speech does. This is further demonstrated by the fact that vocal music has been perceived to interfere more with memory than instrumental music and nature sound music. Rolla (1993) explains that lyrics, being language, develop images that allow for the interpretation of experience in the communicative process. Current research coincides <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>idea</b> and maintains that the sharing of experience by language in song may communicate feeling and mood much more directly than either language itself or instrumental music alone. Vocal music also affects emotion and mood much more swiftly than instrumental music. However, Fogelson (1973) reported instrumental music interfered with children's performance on a reading comprehension test.|$|E
