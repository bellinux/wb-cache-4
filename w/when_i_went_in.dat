They were rabid [...] Like, old ladies saying, 'You better get it right." [...] She revealed that she was initially underwhelmed by a photo of Pattinson, but said of his audition, which was a love scene with co-star Kristen Stewart: [...] "It was electric. The room shorted out, the sky opened up, and I was like, 'This {{is going to be}} good.'" [...] Pattinson has admitted; [...] "I {{had no idea how to}} play the part <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>in,</b> and it was a good thing to find during the audition. I really wanted it after that, but I didn’t really even know what it was. I hadn’t really read any of the books. And just from that, ‘I want this job.’ It was pretty much because of Kristen." [...] In early 2008, Pattinson spoke of a fan backlash against his casting, disclosing Entertainment Weekly that [...] "I stopped reading [...] after I saw the signatures saying 'Please, anyone else.'" [...] He revealed to the Evening Standard that; [...] "The books have a huge following, and I’ve already got bags of letters from angry fans, telling me that I can’t possibly play Edward, because I’m Diggory. I hope I can prove them wrong." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before {{he became}} a {{professional}} cricketer Tyson played for Middleton in the Central Lancashire League, Knypersley in the North Staffordshire League, Durham University and the Army. Although invited for trials by Lancashire at Old Trafford he was turned down ‘because he dipped at the knee’, so he qualified for Northamptonshire in 1952 through residence. Tyson made his first class debut against the Indian tourists in 1952, after his first ball the slips moved back an extra five yards and his first wicket {{was that of the}} Test batsman Pankaj Roy for a duck. Tyson's second first class match was against the Australians in 1953. Richie Benaud was told that the unknown Tyson was a bowler fresh out of Durham University who would give them no trouble. They began to revise this estimation when they saw the wicket-keeper take position halfway to the boundary and young Tyson walked over to the sightscreen to begin his run up. The first ball ricocheted off the edge of Colin McDonald's bat to the boundary, the second trapped him lbw before he could play a stroke, the third was a bouncer that flew past Graeme Hole's nose and the fourth was a yorker that clean bowled Hole and sent his stumps cartwheeling over the wicket-keeper's head. In 1954 at Old Trafford Tyson hit the sightscreen with the ball after it bounced once on the pitch. He is one of only four bowlers to have achieved this feat {{in the history of the}} game, the others being Charles Kortright, Roy Gilchrist and Jeff Thomson. and he was given his county cap in the same year, his first full First Class season. Tyson reckoned that he received his Test call up when ex-England captains Gubby Allen and Norman Yardley saw him hospitalise Bill Edrich at Lords. Edrich, a noted hooker of fast bowling, mistimed his stroke due to the speed of the ball and his cheek bone was broken. The MCC were thereby convinced of the speed and hostility of Tyson's bowling and decided to take him to Australia. He was selected to play for England against Pakistan at the Oval in 1954, taking 4–35 and 1–22 and making 3 runs in each innings batting at number eight, but Pakistan won the match by 24 runs thanks to the bowling of Fazal Mahmood. Although he batted at number eleven in league cricket [...] "The Middleton groundsman was a fatalist. He used to start up the roller to refurbish the wicket <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> to bat". Tyson worked on his batting and in 1954 [...] "was building up a reputation as an all-rounder, scoring consistently with the bat", and he batted at number seven for England. However, this did not develop as much as expected and he reverted to being a lower-order batsman.|$|E
