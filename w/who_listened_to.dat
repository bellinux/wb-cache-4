5|$|Despite {{the poor}} press {{surrounding}} the release, an independent study of select iOS users by Kantar Group {{found that in}} January 2015, 23% of music listeners played at least one song by U2, {{more than any other}} artist for that month.

Multiple news reports (originally based on a 9-1-1 supervisor's account after having overheard the call) asserted that Edward Felt reported hearing an explosion and seeing smoke from an undetermined location on the plane. These reports were not corroborated by Shaw or Felt's wife, Sandra, <b>who</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> the recording afterwards.|$|E
5|$|The novel Fight Club by Chuck Palahniuk was {{published}} in 1996. Before its publication, a 20th Century Fox book scout sent a galley proof of the novel to creative executive Kevin McCormick. The executive assigned a studio reader to review the proof {{as a candidate for}} a film adaptation, but the reader discouraged it. McCormick then forwarded the proof to producers Lawrence Bender and Art Linson, who also rejected it. Producers Josh Donen and Ross Bell saw potential and expressed interest. They arranged unpaid screen readings with actors to determine the script's length, and an initial reading lasted six hours. The producers cut out sections to reduce the running time, and they used the shorter script to record its dialogue. Bell sent the recording to Laura Ziskin, head of the division Fox 2000, <b>who</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> the tape and purchased the rights to Fight Club from Palahniuk for $10,000.|$|E

25|$|Music {{has been}} found to be an {{effective}} tool for music therapists through extensive research. It is beneficial for any individual, both physically and mentally, through improved heart rate, reduced anxiety, stimulation of the brain, and improved learning. Music therapists use their techniques to help their patients in many areas, ranging from stress relief before and after surgeries, to neuropathologies such as Alzheimer's disease. One study found that children <b>who</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> music while having an IV inserted into their arms showed less distress and felt less pain than the children who did not listen to music while having an IV inserted.|$|E
25|$|To {{cover the}} initial {{cost of the}} land, lots were sold at auction where wealthy {{citizens}} purchased graves on prominent locations overlooking the main entrance to the cemetery; Lorenzo Burrows purchased lot number one. The cemetery was dedicated on September 7, 1843 {{in the presence of}} thousands of local residents <b>who</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> a public address by Daniel Cady, Esq. Oversight of the cemetery fell under the responsibility of the village president and board of trustees while lot owners were tasked with caring for and improving their graves. In 1862, after nearly two decades of poor upkeep and minimal improvements, the village board of trustees appointed three commissioners to oversee the cemetery; Lorenzo Burrows, Lemuel C. Paine, and Henry J. Sickels. Upon their appointment, the commissioners hired the cemetery's first caretaker, Michael Hanley, who was responsible for maintaining the cemetery grounds.|$|E

25|$|Buckley became {{interested}} in recording at Easley McCain Recording in Memphis, {{at the suggestion of}} friend Dave Shouse from the Grifters. He rented a shotgun house there, of which he was so fond he contacted the owner about the possibility of buying it. Throughout this period, February 12 to May 26, 1997, Buckley played at Barristers', a bar located in downtown Memphis underneath a parking garage in an alley off Jefferson Avenue. He played numerous times in order to work through the new material in a live atmosphere, at first with the band then solo as part of a Monday night residency. In early February, Buckley and the band did a third recording session with Verlaine, in Memphis, but Buckley expressed his dissatisfaction with the sessions and later called Grace producer, Andy Wallace, to step in as Verlaine's replacement. Buckley started recording demos on his own 4-track recorder in preparation for a forthcoming session with Wallace. Some of these demos were sent to his band in New York, <b>who</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> them enthusiastically, and were excited to resume working on the album. These recordings would go on to compose the second disc of Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk. However Buckley was not entirely happy with the results and he sent his band back to New York while he stayed behind to work on the songs. The band was scheduled to return to Memphis for rehearsals and recording sessions on May 29.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} January 2010, a Yemeni journalist, Abdulelah Hider Sha’ea, said he {{met with}} al-Awlaki, who told Sha'ea that he had met and spoken with Abdulmutallab in Yemen in late 2009. Al-Awlaki also {{reportedly}} called Abdulmutallab one of his students, said that he supported what Abdulmutallab did but did not tell him to do it, {{and that he was}} proud of Abdulmutallab. [...] A New York Times journalist <b>who</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> a digital recording of the meeting said that while the tape's authenticity could not be independently verified, the voice resembled that on other recordings of al-Awlaki.|$|E
500|$|Lead {{singer and}} guitarist Mikey Heppner, <b>who</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> {{progressive}} rock in his youth, wrote {{things that he}} initially withheld from the band, because he felt that his bandmates would not understand him - he described his work as being [...] "way too proggy". Despite his initial doubt, they loved his work when he showed it to them. Thereafter, Heppner began describing the forthcoming record in progressive rock terms during interviews. He told the Whistler Question that it [...] "is a little more musically complex; deeper into the sort of metal side where we started out from", but that [...] "It still sounds like us". He also told Jam! that the new songs were [...] "leaning toward progressive (rock) territory".|$|E

500|$|When Usher {{felt that}} the album was completed, with forty {{recorded}} songs, he submitted the album to his record label, Arista. However, he and the company's then-president, L. A. Reid, <b>who</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> the record, thought something was missing in it. [...] "You know what, there's like {{one or two more}} records that we just gotta get." [...] Usher was displeased with the decision; he felt returning to the studio was the hardest part and needed to re-motivate himself. He went on recording a few more tracks with help from fellow Atlantian's Lil Jon and Ludacris. Eventually, the team was able to produce songs like [...] "Red Light" [...] and [...] "Yeah!". He also recorded songs with P. Diddy and The Neptunes during one of those sessions, but those songs were not released.|$|E
500|$|Chen met his wife, Yuan Weijing, in 2001, after {{listening}} to a radio talk show. Yuan had called into the show to discuss her difficulties in landing a job {{after graduating from the}} foreign language department of Shandong's Chemistry Institute. Chen, <b>who</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> the program, later contacted Yuan and relayed his own story of hardship as a blind man living on just 400 Yuan per year. Yuan was moved by the exchange, and later that year, she traveled to Chen's village to meet him. The couple eloped in 2003. Their [...] son, Chen Kerui, was born later that year. In 2005 they had a second child—a daughter named Chen Kesi—in violation of China's one-child policy. Yuan, who had been working as an English teacher {{at the time of the}} marriage, left her job in 2003 in order to assist her husband in his legal work.|$|E
500|$|Although {{killing two}} {{brothers}} and deposing his father contradicted the Confucian value of filial piety, Taizong showed {{himself to be a}} capable leader <b>who</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> the advice of the wisest members of his council. In 628, Emperor Taizong held a Buddhist memorial service for the casualties of war, and in 629 he had Buddhist monasteries erected at the sites of major battles so that monks could pray for the fallen {{on both sides of the}} fight. This was during the Tang campaign against the Eastern Turks, a Turkic Khaganate that was destroyed after the capture of its ruler, Illig Qaghan, by the famed Tang military officer Li Jing (571–649), who later became a Chancellor of the Tang dynasty. With this victory, the Turks accepted Taizong as their khagan, a title rendered as Tian Kehan in addition to his rule as emperor of China under the traditional title [...] "Son of Heaven".|$|E

500|$|Before its release, {{the album}} was sent to music critic Ivan Bečković <b>who</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> it and wrote a review for the website Macedonian Music Net. According to him, {{the album was}} a logical step in the singer's career after the success of Makedonsko Devojče (2008). He noted how both albums exhibit the [...] "perfect {{combination}} - city music sang in a magical manner by a city girl". He noted that the lyrics of the songs were genuine and leave an impression of being someone's real past experiences, thus showcasing the singer's intention to leave a long-lasting project behind her. He added how [...] "leaning to her internal instincts and needs, she elevates her power and spirituality to a higher level". Bečković also thought that the album's uniqueness lies in its combination of various musical elements which distinguish it from classical Macedonian čalgija. He concluded his review, observing that {{at the very beginning}} of 2014, the Macedonian music scene had already received its album of the year.|$|E
500|$|Music critic Bruce Eder, in {{a review}} for the AllMusic website, wrote the Beach Boys [...] "brush up against {{the dark side of}} the '60s, in the form of 'Never Learn Not to Love'". In his {{assessment}} of the song, Richie Unterberger commented [...] "Never Learn Not to Love" [...] is far more notorious for its relation to Manson, not the music itself which he describes as [...] "average". Author Carl Larkin, in his book The Encyclopedia of Popular Music, wrote the track [...] "had the ironic distinction of putting Charles Manson in the charts". Journalist Nathan Jolly called the song [...] "softer but still eerie", also noting how fans of the Beach Boys <b>who</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> the song over the years [...] "had no idea of the inherent evil of its actual composer". Throughout the years, [...] "Never Learn Not to Love" [...] has appeared on several other Beach Boys compilations and bootlegs.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the artists}} have not {{released}} sales figures, they {{have indicated that}} the album was purchased across the globe during the first 24hours it was available and that the servers hosting the album delivered [...] "severalterabytes" [...] by September 6. A report in lateDecember asserted that they had sold [...] "nearly 20,000downloads." [...] In March 2009, IanC.Rogers of TopspinMedia explained that 20percent of those <b>who</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> the album streaming chose to purchase it and 30percent of them included a physical copy of the CD; trends that would hold through September of that year. By October 2008, Byrne explained that they had recouped their losses on the album and that sales had [...] "paid back the recording costs and costs for building the Website." [...] He would later explain that this business model worked well for established acts as well as smaller bands, due to minimal production and distribution costs. Their business model also allowed them to self-release and plan a tour immediately after finishing the music production, rather than wait months for record label advancement.|$|E

500|$|In June 2001, {{several months}} before the release of Invincible, [...] "Speechless" [...] was among several songs showcased from the album {{exclusively}} to executives of Jackson's music label, Epic Records (a subsidiary of Sony Music Entertainment). Other songs previewed included [...] "Unbreakable", [...] "The Lost Children", [...] "Whatever Happens", [...] "Break of Dawn", [...] "Heaven Can Wait" [...] and [...] "Privacy", all of which featured on Invincibles track listing. Roger Friedman of Fox News reported that the executives <b>who</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> the previews liked what they heard. Epic Records' president, Dave Glew, said of the tracks, [...] "It's wonderful and amazing. Michael is singing better than ever." [...] He added, [...] "The ballads! The ballads are beautiful, and they're all there." [...] "Speechless" [...] was later released as a promotional single in 2001. A remixed version of [...] "You Rock My World", featuring rapper Jay-Z, served as the single's B-side. After Jackson's death, a clip of the entertainer singing [...] "Speechless" [...] was included in Michael Jackson's This Is It, a commercially successful documentary-concert film of the singer's rehearsals for his London concert series.|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of the {{practices}} of the SABC, record companies began putting pressure on their artists to avoid controversial songs, and often also made changes to songs they were releasing. Individuals were expected to racially segregate their musical choices as well: mixed-race bands were sometimes forced to play with some members behind a curtain, and people <b>who</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> music composed by members of a different race faced government suspicion. Many black musicians faced harassment from the police; Jonas Gwangwa stated that performers were often stopped and required to explain their presence in [...] "white" [...] localities. Black musicians were forbidden from playing at venues when alcohol was sold, and performers were required to have an extra [...] "night pass" [...] {{to be able to work}} in the evenings. Further restrictions were placed by the government each time it declared a state of emergency, and internal security legislation was also used to ban material. Music from artists outside the country was also targeted by the censors; all songs by The Beatles were banned in the 1960s, and Stevie Wonder's music was banned in 1985, after he dedicated his Oscar award to Mandela. Two independent radio stations, Capital Radio and Radio 702 came into being in 1979 and 1980, respectively. Since these were based in the [...] "independent" [...] homelands of Transkei and Bophutatswana, respectively, they were nominally not bound by the government's regulations. Although they tended to follow the decisions of the Directorate, they also played music by bands such as Juluka, which were not featured by the SABC. Neither station, however, played [...] "Sun City" [...] when it was released in 1985, as the owners of the Sun City resort had partial ownership of both stations.|$|E
2500|$|Whereas initial {{studies were}} focused on the {{behaviors}} {{of the person who}} shares their own emotions, later studies examined the impact of such interaction on the [...] "recipient" [...] of the social sharing (the person <b>who</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> the recounting of the emotional event).|$|E
