5|$|Bottomley {{also holds}} the single-season {{record for most}} unassisted double plays by a first baseman, with eight. Bottomley {{is also known as}} the only man to be sued for hitting a home run when a fan was hit by the ball when he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>looking.</b> He had over 100 RBIs in each season from 1924 to 1929. Bottomley was the second player in {{baseball}} history to hit 20 or more doubles, triples, and home runs in one season (Frank Schulte being the first) and the first of two players (Lou Gehrig being the other) to collect 150 or more doubles, triples, and home runs in a career.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opening}} match, The Allied Powers (Davey Boy Smith and Lex Luger) faced the Blu Brothers (Eli and Jacob). Smith started {{out on the}} offensive, but Jacob gained control with a running bulldog throw. The Blus {{capitalized}} {{on the fact that}} they are identical twins by switching places while the referee <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>looking.</b> Luger came into the match near the end and performed a running forearm smash on Eli. Jacob tried to throw Luger with a powerbomb, but Luger tagged in Smith, who performed a sunset flip to pin Jacob and win the match.|$|E
5|$|The TNA World Tag Team Championship was {{defended by}} LAX against Beer Money, Inc. {{in the next}} encounter. Jacqueline {{accompanied}} Beer Money to the ring, while Salinas and Héctor Guerrero accompanied LAX. The duration of the encounter was 14 minutes and 15 seconds. Filthee, Grandmaster Caz, and Melle Mel performed LAX's theme during their entrance. Near {{the end of the}} contest, Jacqueline and Salinas both interfered in the match. This led to Roode smacking Homicide in his injured right eye with a beer bottle while the referee <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>looking.</b> Storm then gained the pinfall to win the TNA World Tag Team Championship for his team.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} month at Saturday Night's Main Event, a title match was scheduled between Edge and Cena. Cena won the match by disqualification, after Lita interfered {{on behalf of}} Edge. A singles match was booked between Edge and Cena for the WWE title at Summerslam, with the stipulation that if Edge disqualified himself, he would have lost the WWE title. At SummerSlam, Edge retained the title after he hit Cena {{with a pair of}} brass knuckles, this occurred when the referee <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>looking.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} match, a covered cage sat at ringside, supposedly containing 200 pounds of Harlem sewer rats, although {{the contents of}} the cage were not revealed. Bad News Brown controlled most of the early stages of his match against Jake Roberts. Roberts attempted to perform the DDT twice, including once when Brown was arguing with special referee Big Bossman, but Brown blocked the move both times. Outside the ring, Brown hit Roberts with a chair while the Big Bossman <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>looking.</b> Roberts gained the advantage by punching Brown repeatedly but was kicked to the outside after Brown reversed a DDT attempt into a back bodydrop. Brown hit Roberts with a chair again but was disqualified when the Bossman saw him. Brown tried to gain revenge after the match by attacking Roberts's boa constrictor, Damien, but the Bossman attacked Brown to save the snake.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{determined}} Yeates {{had spent}} the evening of 17 December 2010 with colleagues at the Bristol Ram pub on Park Street, leaving at around 8:00pm to begin the 30-minute walk home. She told friends and colleagues that she <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> forward to spending the weekend alone {{as it would be}} her first in the flat without Reardon; she planned to spend her time baking in preparation for a party the couple would be throwing the following week, and shopping for Christmas. Yeates was seen on closed-circuit television (CCTV) at around 8:10pm leaving a Waitrose supermarket without purchasing anything. She phoned her best friend, Rebecca Scott, at 8:30pm to arrange a meeting on Christmas Eve. The last known footage of Yeates recorded her buying a pizza from a branch of Tesco Express at around 8:40pm. She had also bought two small bottles of cider at a nearby off-licence, Bargain Booze.|$|E

5|$|The {{period of}} calm for Pagan {{ended in the}} early 1270s. By then, the Song were on the ropes, and Emperor Kublai Khan, who officially founded the Yuan dynasty on 18 December 1271, sought {{to cut off the}} retreat of Song {{refugees}} in all directions. In Pagan's case, he had ordered the Mongol governor of Dali to tighten control of the borderlands, and in January 1271 to send a mission to Pagan to demand tribute. The tribute he demanded was nominal. Given his higher priority preoccupations elsewhere, the emperor <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> to replace the regime at Pagan. At the border, the ruler of the Wa and Palaung regions submitted to the Mongols.|$|E

He also began a gimmick where he would degrade women, which involved him attacking female WWF employees.

25|$|While {{waiting for}} their turn in the {{electric}} chair, Makley and Pierpont carved a pair of revolvers from large bars of soap, and blackened them with shoe polish. On September 22, 1934, the two used these props to attempt an escape. They assaulted a guard and freed Clark from his cell nearby. Before they had gone far, Clark, who <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> at an imminent death sentence, lost his nerve and retreated to his cell. Moments later, armed guards arrived and shot Makley and Pierpont. Makley, hit in the thorax and abdomen, died on the scene. Pierpont was seriously wounded, but survived and was later executed. Makley's death certificate states that internal hemorrhaging from these wounds caused his death. He is buried in the Sugar Ridge Cemetery in Leipsic, Ohio.|$|E
25|$|On {{the same}} cliff path where Nofret and Satipy died, Renisenb, {{apparently}} summoned by Hori, hears footsteps {{behind her and}} turns to see Yahmose. She then sees the look of murderous hatred in her brother's eyes that the other women saw before they were killed. On the brink of her own death, she realises that Satipy <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> in fear at anything beyond Yahmose — she was looking straight at him. He had consumed a non-lethal dose of poison and pretended to recuperate while committing murders, both to make himself chief heir and to indulge his newfound love of violence. As Renisenb realises some of this, Hori slays Yahmose with an arrow and saves her. Hori explains all. Renisenb's final choice is whom to marry: Kameni, a lively husband not unlike her first, or Hori, an older and more enigmatic figure. She makes her choice and falls into Hori’s arms.|$|E

25|$|After Cyber Sunday, the feud between King Booker and Batista {{continued}} with Batista unable to wrest the title from Booker. Eventually {{this led to}} a match at Survivor Series on November 26, where King Booker declared that if Batista failed to defeat him this time, it would be the last World Heavyweight Championship match he would receive. On the night of the show, SmackDown General Manager Theodore Long decided that if King Booker got counted out or disqualified, Batista would become champion. Late in the match, Queen Sharmell handed King Booker his title belt while referee Nick Patrick <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>looking.</b> While she had Patrick distracted, the King attempted to hit Batista with the belt. Batista moved out of the way, knocked the belt out of Booker's hands and hit the champion in the head, allowing him to score the pinfall. After losing the World title, Booker feuded alongside former royal court member Finlay against Batista and John Cena, which led up to Armageddon where they lost.|$|E
25|$|The Australian juggernaut seemed unstoppable as {{they looked}} on course for their 17th {{consecutive}} victory in the second test at the Eden Gardens. Australia amassed 445 runs in the first innings after winning the toss and electing to bat first. In reply, Indian team was bowled out for meagre 171 conceding a lead of 274 runs. Dravid scored 25 runs from 82 balls and eventually got out bowled to Warne for the 2nd time in a row. Only Laxman scored more than Dravid in the innings. India was expectedly asked to follow-on by Steve Waugh. Laxman, who had scored a fine fifty in the first innings was promoted to no. 3 position which had been Dravid's usual spot for quite sometime now, while Dravid, who <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> in best of form in the series, was relegated to no. 6 position. Although Indian batting displayed better show in the second innings, they were still looking towards a certain defeat. Dravid came out to bat at no. 6 with scoreboard reading 232/4 with India still needing 42 runs to avoid an innings defeat. Dravid joined forces {{with the man who}} had replaced him at no. 3 position as they played out the remaining time avoiding any further jolts. India ended the day's play at 254/4 with Laxman unbeaten at 109 and Dravid at 7.|$|E
500|$|Measuring , Torpedo...Los! is an oil {{on canvas}} painting. By {{enlarging}} {{the face of the}} captain relative to the entire field, Lichtenstein makes him more prominent than in the source. He retained the source's [...] "clumsiness" [...] in how the secondary figure is presented and replaced the dialogue with a much shorter [...] "cryptic command". The original source had dialog related to the repeated torpedoing of the same ship, but Lichtenstein cut the entire speech balloon down to two words. He moved the captain's scar from his nose to his cheek and he made the captain appear more aggressive by depicting him with his mouth wide open, also opting to leave the eye which <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> through the periscope open. He also made the ship appear to be more technologically sophisticated with a variety of changes. The scar was actually most readily apparent in panels other than the source from the same story.|$|E

500|$|Veteran {{character}} actor Mark Metcalf appeared in heavy prosthetic make-up {{for the role}} of the Master, belying his iconic performance in the film National Lampoon's Animal House (1978) as Douglas C. Neidermeyer. In 2011, Metcalf recognized his role on Buffy as one of his favorites. Many actors auditioned for the part, but Whedon felt Metcalf played it with more complexity, bringing a [...] "sly and kind of urbane" [...] sensitivity and a charm to the villainy of the character. Kristine Sutherland was cast as Buffy's mother Joyce. Sutherland, who disliked the horror genre, <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> for acting jobs when her agent called her with the opportunity to play Joyce. Sutherland auditioned the same day as David Boreanaz, and was impressed with how naturally she felt at ease with the material in the scripts. Bob Flutie, Sunnydale High School's principal, was originally played by Stephen Tobolowsky in the unaired pilot. Ken Lerner was cast as Flutie in the broadcast version.|$|E
500|$|Many {{details of}} Ruth's {{childhood}} are unknown, including {{the date of}} his parents' marriage. As a child, Ruth spoke German. When young George was a toddler, {{the family moved to}} 339 South Goodyear Street, not far from the rail yards; by the time the boy was 6, his father had a saloon with an upstairs apartment at 426 West Camden Street. Details are equally scanty about why young George was sent at the age of 7 to St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys, a reformatory and orphanage. As an adult, Babe Ruth reminisced that as a youth he had been running the streets and rarely attending school, as well was drinking beer when his father <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>looking.</b> Some accounts say that following a violent incident at his father's saloon, the city authorities decided that this environment was unsuitable for a small child. George, Jr. entered St. Mary's on June 13, 1902. He was recorded as [...] "incorrigible" [...] and spent much of the next twelve years there.|$|E
500|$|Mexican actor Ricardo Montalbán {{was cast}} as the genetic superman Khan Noonian Singh, having been the first choice for the role. He had been {{suggested}} by casting director Joseph D'Agosta, who <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> to cast an actor of a particular ethnic background due to Roddenberry's vision for the series; Roddenberry wanted to show his perceived 23rd century values by not requiring any specific ethnicities when casting actors in guest roles. Montalbán had previously appeared in a television movie created by Roddenberry, The Secret Weapon of 117 (also referred to as The Secret Defense of 117), which was the writer's first attempt to create science fiction on television and aired {{more than ten years}} before Star Trek. Montalbán called his role as Khan [...] "wonderful", saying that [...] "it was well-written, it had an interesting concept and I was delighted it was offered to me". The main cast were enthusiastic about working with Montalbán; DeForest Kelley later said [...] "I enjoyed working with Ricardo the best. I was privileged. He is a marvelous actor." ...|$|E
