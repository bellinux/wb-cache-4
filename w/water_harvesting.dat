40|$|Cranberries are {{harvested}} by two basic methods, dry <b>harvest</b> and <b>water</b> <b>harvest.</b> The dry harvest fruit is destined {{primarily for the}} fresh market while the <b>water</b> <b>harvested</b> fruit is processed. Growers manage cranberry plantings to facilitate these harvest methods and fruit uses. Ideally, the fruit {{are harvested}} at full maturity with good color (anthocyanin content) but prior to the fruit becoming over-ripe. Timing of harvest is important for fresh-market fruit so that the berries are sufficiently red but retain good storage quality, while fruit for the process market ideally has maximum color. Cranberry marketing companies produce ‘no color added’ products, so the color at harvest is of great importance in processed berries. Following the harvest, management practices focus on minimizing harvest stress and preparing the bogs for the dormant season. To minimize disease and weed infestations, leaf litter and fallen fruit are removed from the bogs...|$|R

25|$|An older {{method of}} {{harvesting}} {{is to use}} a sweep net, which operates a bit like a purse seine net. The sweep net is a big net with weights along the bottom edge. It is stretched across the pen with the bottom edge extending {{to the bottom of the}} pen. Lines attached to the bottom corners are raised, herding some fish into the purse, where they are netted. Before killing, the fish are usually rendered unconscious in water saturated in carbon dioxide, although this practice is being phased out in some countries due to ethical and product quality concerns. More advanced systems use a percussive-stun harvest system that kills the fish instantly and humanely with a blow to the head from a pneumatic piston. They are then bled by cutting the gill arches and immediately immersing them in iced <b>water.</b> <b>Harvesting</b> and killing methods are designed to minimise scale loss, and avoid the fish releasing stress hormones, which negatively affect flesh quality.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Harvesting</b> <b>water</b> from {{humid air}} via dewing {{can provide a}} viable {{solution}} to a water shortage problem where liquid-phase water is not available. Here we experimentally quantify the effects of wettability and geometry of the condensation substrate on the <b>water</b> <b>harvest</b> efficiency. Uniformly hydrophilic surfaces are found to exhibit higher rates of water condensation and collection than surfaces with lower wettability. This {{is in contrast to}} a fog basking method where the most efficient surface consists of hydrophilic islands surrounded by hydrophobic background. A thin drainage path in the lower portion of the condensation substrate is revealed to greatly enhance the water collection efficiency. The optimal surface conditions found in this work can be used to design a practical device that <b>harvests</b> <b>water</b> as its biological counterpart, a green tree frog, Litoria caerulea, does during the dry season in tropical northern Australia.

The largest tank had a capacity of 6 million gallons of water. There were completely false rumors, that a treasure belonging to the Kachwaha rulers of Amber had been stacked in the fort precincts (including the water tanks), that led to a totally unsuccessful search. The search had been ordered during the Emergency declared by the Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi during 1975–1977. A futile search was also launched, in 1977, of all the buildings in the fort, by the Income Tax department, using metal detectors. There was also a Parliament Question on this issue where a question was posed whether a [...] "Search for treasure carried out from 10th June 1976 till November 1976 by the Income Tax Authorities at Jaigarh Fort on the Jaipur Delhi Road was closed to ordinary traffic for one or two days so as to make way for military trucks carrying treasures to the residence of the then Prime Minister, Smt. Indira Gandhi?". However, the search carried out for treasures by an Army unit at Jaigarh Fort, after a three-month search had found no treasures.
