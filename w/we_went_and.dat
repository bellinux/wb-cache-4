5|$|We were in {{a studio}} in New York, this place called the Magic Shop, and it had this thing called a tack piano there, which sounds like an old honky-tonk piano, where you put little tacks in the hammers, so it sounds like more of a {{harpsichord}} almost. And {{so we wanted to}} use that kind of sound, but we didn't have a tack piano, so rather than sample it, <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>and</b> bought an old piano from the shop up the road from our studio, and we bought a load of tacks, and me and Guy and Jon spent a couple of hours pushing tacks into the piano hammers.|$|E
500|$|Publicly, Hammerstein {{accepted}} {{blame for}} himself and Rodgers, and stated that had the musical been produced by anyone else, [...] "we'd say that these are producers we wouldn't {{like to work with}} again". According to Cy Feuer, Hammerstein privately blamed him and Martin, telling them, [...] "We believed your pitch and <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>and</b> did something we were never cut out to do and we should never have done it.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} the {{development}} of the song by NME.com, vocalist Chris Martin said, [...] "From that version, [...] <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>and</b> did a whole other version of it. A whole other song. What happened with the song 'Talk' is that it was all going great and then someone said 'That should be the first single' and we all just freaked out and scrapped it all. [...] We’ve just mixed it and it sounds great. I think we’ve had such pain getting to that place, I’m not sure anyone quite knows {{what to do with it}} anymore. When we heard it mixed properly, it sounded mega." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Then {{we shall}} be passing the Genoese galleys, directly," [...] Francis said. [...] "Row slowly as <b>we</b> <b>go,</b> <b>and</b> splash {{sometimes}} with the oars. If <b>we</b> <b>go</b> quickly <b>and</b> noiselessly past, they might possibly suspect something, but if we row without an attempt at concealment, they will take us for a fisherman's boat." ...|$|R
2500|$|Jean-Claude Homawoo, an {{opposition}} representative on CENI, said that opposition supporters were totally disillusioned with the electoral process: [...] "So many times <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>and</b> voted in elections {{we knew we}} had won, only for the opposite result to be declared. So people have become tired. They don't believe their vote counts anymore." [...] Esso, the RPT Secretary-General, described the result as [...] "great victory that gives us a lot of satisfaction and wipes off any doubts about the process", while Bodjona dismissed the opposition as [...] "bad losers". For its part, the EU observer mission released a report that noted the accusations of vote-buying by the RPT, but also suggested there was no evidence to support opposition claims of outright fraud.|$|E
2500|$|... "Heavensent" [...] (December 2001), {{the first}} single from the album, reached the top30 in early 2002 even though [...] "live {{promotion}} for the track was limited" [...] as Ella recovered. She had had problems, [...] "I knew they would push me to sing... They told me the whole project couldn't stop for a year. That much time out was not allowed career-wise. I wanted to say, 'Stop. I know {{we can do this}} right, but not now.' But then <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>and</b> did it anyway." [...] Its second single, [...] "Outside of Me", which reached a peak of No.12, appeared in September 2002. A third song from the album, [...] "Ammyl (Say What You Wanna Say)", was a radio-only release in 2003 – not issued as a physical single.|$|E

60|$|Like ape or clown, in monstrous garb With crooked arrows starred, Silently <b>we</b> <b>went</b> round <b>and</b> round The {{slippery}} asphalte yard; Silently <b>we</b> <b>went</b> round <b>and</b> round, And no man spoke a word.|$|R
6000|$|... "Something {{is going}} to come of this, I am convinced; I would bet any money on it. Well, shall <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> have a trial at once?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It's {{the heat}} of the room," [...] said Alice. [...] "Shall <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> sit outside on the terrace? Never mind about the lemonade. I'm not really thirsty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Suppose <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> {{have some}} jellies at Dutton's," [...] and the rogue Jos, willing to kill two birds with one stone. [...] "Devilish fine gal at Dutton's." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Why, {{here she}} is!’ cried Trotty, {{catching}} her up. ‘Here’s little Lilian! Ha ha ha!

O, Uncle Will, the obligations that you’ve laid me under, by your coming, my good friend!’ ...|$|R
6000|$|My wife {{contrived}} that {{we should}} fall in behind the young people as <b>we</b> <b>went,</b> <b>and</b> she asked, [...] "What DO you suppose she made of it all?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{should like}} to ask," [...] said Bickley, [...] "whither <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> for what object, points on which {{up to the present}} we have had no {{definite}} information." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is an {{extraordinary}} hour," [...] he remarked, [...] "for Heseltine to be wanting us. Shall <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> see what it means, Haviland? You will excuse us, Prince?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shall <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> {{look at the}} aviary?" [...] said Mr. Magnet, {{reverting}} to a favourite idea of his, and then remembered {{she did not like}} to see caged birds.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah--that public-house {{experience}} {{accounts for}} your knowing about the adulteration of the ale when <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>and</b> had some that Sunday evening. I thought when I married {{you that you}} had always lived in your father's house." ...|$|E
60|$|Afterwards, as the shrieks and {{shouting}} had now died {{down to a}} confused murmur of many voices, <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>and</b> sat outside under the projecting eaves of the hut, where I introduced Stephen Somers to Brother John.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>and</b> {{looked at}} the {{shattered}} houses, and Harold showed us where he had drawn out his poor friend, answering the aggrieved owners opposite {{that there would be}} an inquiry, and means would be found for compensation.|$|E

60|$|I {{considered}} the matter a moment, {{and then up}} stairs <b>we</b> <b>went,</b> <b>and</b> I was ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure enough, with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers to sleep abreast.|$|E
6000|$|... "Would it do any good?" [...] {{said the}} Story Girl desperately. [...] "Even {{if she did}} make Pat sick I suppose it would only make her crosser if <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>and</b> accused her of bewitching him. Besides, she didn't do {{anything}} of the sort." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Man's the {{creature}} of habit,' said Mr. Britain, surveying her, over his saucer. 'I had somehow {{got used to}} you, Clem; and I found I shouldn't {{be able to get}} on without you. So <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>and</b> got made man and wife. Ha! ha! We! Who'd have thought it!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There," [...] said Rollo, with a tone {{of great}} satisfaction, when he had done this, [...] "now he is safe. We'll let him stay, while <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> catch another bee." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not before midnight, I think. Shall <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> {{walk down}} by the lake, it will be cooler there, and we shall be quite undisturbed? Walls have ears sometimes, you know." ...|$|R
