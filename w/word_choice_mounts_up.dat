40|$|In daily conversation, Javanese became use Javanese {{language}} {{when they}} speak {{to one another}} people which come to Javanese to communicate to each other. Javanese language condition itself nowadays is very anxiously because the changes of war. Many Javanese sometimes do not use the right speech level in choosing the words they utter. Javanese themselves are distinguished in two kinds of social groups, they are priyayi and non-priyayi. In social relationship, both of the social groups have their own way in selecting the appropriate levels of <b>word</b> <b>choices.</b> In this study, the writer wants to observe the Javanese speech levels in terms of <b>word</b> <b>choices</b> as displayed by priyayi and non-priyayi in Yogyakarta in informal situations. There {{are two kinds of}} problems which the writer wants to answer: which <b>word</b> <b>choices</b> of Javanese Speech Levels are used by priyayi and non-priyayi in Yogyakarta in informal situations and what the underliying factors influence the participants in uttering their <b>word</b> <b>choices</b> of Javanese Speech Levels. In answering those two questions, the writer made an observation, interview and questionnaire in order that she could get the data for the study. To collect the data, the writer asked her informants about the details of Javanese Speech levels while she recorded the conversations herself without being involving in the conversations. The writer took to subjects in recording the data and answering the questionnaire. The writer found that the <b>word</b> <b>choices</b> of Javanese speech levels that are used by priyayi and non-priyayi are noun, verb, adverb, adjective and pronoun. The underlying factors which influence the participants are: (1). The degree of formality or social distance in the relationship between the speaker and addressee; whether their relationship are close or distant, (2). The diferrence of social status of the addressee, they belong to priyayi or non-priyayi, (3). The difference age of the participants. From the data the writer concludes that Javanese always select the <b>word</b> <b>choices</b> of speech levels based on social distant, social status and age between the participants. The level of formality or social distance in the relationship determines the selection of <b>word</b> <b>choices</b> of Javanese Speech Levels. The social status of the addressee determined of whether the addressee itself belongs to what group they were in: a group of priyayi a group of non-priyayi. Age can consider as one of the important factors in determining the <b>word</b> <b>choices</b> of Javanese Speech Levels...|$|R

40|$|Accurate and native-like <b>word</b> <b>choice</b> {{in writing}} is an {{important}} but problematic area of second language use. This paper presents an analytic foundation for pedagogical research and application which extends beyond the traditional 'superficial' categories of morphosyntactic rule violations and false cognates. Simultaneous 'complementary' analytic categories are proposed: the complexity of understanding <b>word</b> <b>choice</b> in written production entails the incorporation of several relevant theoretical and applied perspectives: lexical-semantics, syntax, text-analysis, pragmatics, language acquisition, cognition and memory, and pedagogical research. This study focuses on the first four as a necessary preliminary step. Major categories of <b>word</b> <b>choice</b> analysis are synthesized from both a theoretical perspective and from an empirical one, with an examination of data from ESL writers. The paper goes on to discuss implications for ESL pedagogy and further research...|$|R

40|$|Language, whether {{spoken by}} {{teachers}} and students, written by published authors in various literary genres, or scribed by students in their own writing, can be valuable and interesting. However, for many learners (second language speakers, and students experiencing difficulty in learning how to read) being able to read, comprehend, and apply specific vocabulary words and terms are {{not always easy to}} accomplish. In this highly interactive workshop, the presenter will guide participants to discover how an author’s <b>word</b> <b>choice</b> can lead to rich vocabulary learning and enhanced reading comprehension. By means of different participant activities, PowerPoint slides, varied text demonstrations/examinations, and discussion, the presenter will share a rationale and practical strategies to help students (kindergarten-grade 12) recognize the importance of <b>word</b> <b>choice</b> in different text genres and apply these particular words in their own writing. Suggestions for mentor texts that model an author’s use of relevant words will be shared, along with sample mini-lessons to remind students to consider the value of <b>word</b> <b>choice</b> in their own written compositions. The presenter will point out the important difference in vocabulary choice found in fiction, nonfiction, and poems. This workshop should provide valuable instructional tools for preservice and inservice classroom teachers, reading specialists, second language teachers, and teacher educators as they impart the importance of <b>word</b> <b>choice</b> in reading, comprehending, and writing various texts. Participants will leave this workshop with a handout packet, novel ideas for their classrooms, and a new appreciation for the importance of <b>word</b> <b>choice</b> in different text genres...|$|R

40|$|We present two novel {{classes of}} noisy channel models to address verb infinitive/present participle {{confusion}} and <b>word</b> <b>choice</b> production errors in text produced by English {{as a second}} language (ESL) authors in an extension of Park and Levy (2011). In our <b>word</b> <b>choice</b> model, which is the primary contribution of this work, we model the English <b>word</b> <b>choices</b> made by ESL authors as a random walk across an undirected bipartite dictionary graph composed of edges between English words and associated words in the author's native language. We use cascades of weighted finite-state transducers (wFSTs) to model language model priors, verb form confusion and random walk-induced noise, and observed sentences, and expectation maximization (EM) to learn model parameters. Additionally, we explore the use of online EM for model training. We show that such models can make intelligent verb form and dictionary-based word substitutions to improve grammaticality and fluency in an unsupervised settin...|$|R
