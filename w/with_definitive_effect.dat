40|$|Purpose. To {{compare the}} impact of {{prognostic}} factors of patients treated <b>with</b> <b>definitive</b> radio(chemo) therapy versus patients treated with surgery and postoperative radiotherapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the oro- and hypopharynx. Patients and Methods. 162 patients treated <b>with</b> <b>definitive</b> radiotherapy and 126 patients treated with postoperative radiotherapy were retrospectively analysed. The impact of the prognostic factors gender, age, total tumor volume (TTV), pre-radiotherapy hemoglobin level (Hb-level), tumor site, T- and N-classification, radiotherapy interruptions > 5 days, radiotherapy versus simultaneous radiochemotherapy, R-status and time interval between surgery and radiotherapy were investigated. Results. The median follow-up time for the censored patients treated <b>with</b> <b>definitive</b> radio(chemo) therapy was 28. 5 months and for postoperative radiotherapy 36. 5 months. On univariate analysis, the TTV, Hb-level, and simultaneous radiochemotherapy {{had a significant impact}} on the survival of patients treated <b>with</b> <b>definitive</b> radio(chemo) therapy. For patients treated with postoperative radiotherapy, only the TTV showed a statistical trend for the survival (P = 0. 13). On multivariate analysis, the TTV and simultaneous radiochemotherapy maintained their statistical significance for patients treated <b>with</b> <b>definitive</b> raditherapy, and the TTV, the statistical trend for patients treated with postoperative radiotherapy (P = 0. 19).

40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the outcome in {{patients}} with penile cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 60 patients with penile carcinoma were included. Of the patients, 45 (n = 27) underwent surgery, and 51 underwent definitive (n = 29) or postoperative (n = 22) radiotherapy (RT). Median follow-up was 62 months. RESULTS: Median time to locoregional relapse was 14 months. Local failure was observed in 3 of 23 patients (13 %) treated with surgery with or without postoperative RT vs. in 19 of 33 patients (56 %) given organ-sparing treatment (p = 0. 0008). Of 22 local failures, 16 (73 %) were salvaged with surgery. Of the 33 patients treated <b>with</b> <b>definitive</b> RT (n = 29) and the 4 patients refusing RT after excisional biopsy, local control was obtained with organ preservation in 13 (39 %). In the remaining 20, 4 patients with local failure underwent salvage conservatively, resulting in an ultimate penis preservation rate of 17 of 33 (52 %) patients treated <b>with</b> <b>definitive</b> RT. The 5 -year and 10 -year probability of surviving with an intact penis was 43 % and 26 %, respectively. There was no survival difference between the patients treated <b>with</b> <b>definitive</b> RT and primary surgery (56 % vs. 53 %; p = 0. 16). In multivariate analysis, independent factors influencing survival were N-classification and pathologic grade. Surgery was the only independent predictor for better local control. CONCLUSION: Based on our study findings, in patients with penile cancer, local control is superior with surgery. However, there is no difference in survival between patients treated with surgery and those treated <b>with</b> <b>definitive</b> RT, <b>with</b> 52 % organ preservation...|$|R

40|$|Background and purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the prognostic significance of the pre-treatment haemoglobin level among patients with inoperable non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) treated <b>with</b> <b>definitive</b> radiotherapy <b>with</b> regard to loco-regional tumour control (LC) and overall survival (OS). Material and methods: Patients (n= 526) with previously untreated NSCLC, stages I-IIIb, WHO-performance status of 0 - 2 were eligible. All patients were treated <b>with</b> <b>definitive</b> external irradiation (60 Gy in 6 weeks). Results: In the multivariate analysis, the pre-treatment haemoglobin level was an independent prognostic factor for both loco-regional control and the overall survival. Conclusions: pre-treatment haemoglobin levels are strongly associated with loco-regional tumour control and the overall survival. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Cytology {{is central}} in the {{diagnosis}} of malignancy in effusions. Ancillary techniques, mainly immunocytochemistry, have considerably improved the sensitivity but some 10 % of all cases remain equivocal and require the addition of new diagnostic modalities. We have previously shown that strong nuclear telomerase activity determined with Telomere Repeat Amplification Protocol (TRAP) in situ is specific for malignant cells and could {{be a candidate for}} an additional test. Thirty effusions remaining diagnostically equivocal after the use of immunocytochemistry and the determination of the hyaluronan content were reviewed and their TRAP in situ reactivity was related to the definitive diagnoses based on all available data. There were seven effusions from patients <b>with</b> <b>definitive</b> benign diagnoses and 23 effusions from patients <b>with</b> <b>definitive</b> malignant diagnoses. Strong telomerase activity was seen only in effusions from patients <b>with</b> <b>definitive</b> malignant diagnosis, all effusions from patients with benign disease lacking strong telomerase activity, whereas eight of the malignant cases, including three cases of epithelial mesothelioma, showed strong reactivity. Strong nuclear TRAP in situ reactivity was demonstrated only in effusions from patients with verified malignant disease. Although the study is small, it suggests that TRAP in situ activity provides diagnostic information in about one-third of effusions remaining cytologically equivocal after the use of current ancillary techniques.
