40|$|This study {{presents}} {{field and}} chronological investigations {{along the coast}} of northeastern Brazil from ~ 4 °S to 9 °S latitude, which corresponds to ~ 700 km of coastline under a semi-diurnal mesotidal regime. We investigated <b>wave-built</b> <b>terrace</b> deposits and dated sediments using the optically stimulated luminescence and thermoluminescence methods on quartz grains. The wave-built terraces yielded two main age groups: 200 - 230 ka and 100 - 130 ka, which we interpreted as depositional ages. We correlated these age groups with oxygen-isotope stages 7 c and 5 e, respectively. These events correspond to the antepenultimate and penultimate transgressions along the Brazilian coast. The deposits occur mainly in patches on low-lying flat plateaus along the littoral zone and incision valleys that cut across coastal tablelands. The altitude of the base of the 200 - 230 ka terraces ranges from 10 m above mean sea level (asl) to - 2 m asl, whereas the base of the 100 - 130 ka varies from 12 m asl to - 2 m asl. Both terraces were deposited in the foreshore and upper shoreface zones. We noted a coincidence between sea-level highstand chronologies in northeastern Brazil and those in the Bahamas and Bermuda...|$|E
40|$|The {{magnitude}} {{and rate of}} vertical movements have been measured in the offshore Capo Vaticano (western Calabria) for the Late Pleistocene - Holocene {{on the basis of}} the depth of submerged coastal prism and associated <b>wave-built</b> <b>terrace</b> formed during the sea-level lowstand of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Uplifted and submerged terraces have proved to be valuable recorders of vertical motion in many locations around the world (e. g. DICKINSON, 2001; WEBSTER et alii, 2004) as the depth of their tops appear to be controlled by the sea-level. In the eastern Tyrrhenian margins, depending on the hydraulic energy conditions (i. e. waves and wind-induced currents), the average water depth of terraced surface of lowstand coastal prisms was probably 15 - 20 m (CHIOCCI & ORLANDO, 1996). A series of LGM lowstand coastal prisms and associated wave-built terraces were identified on a new set of very highresolution reflection seismic profiles acquired along the continental shelf and upper slope of the western Calabria continental margin. Data processing included time-depth conversion and the interpretation of the resulting seismic lines was performed using a GIS-based software package. Seismic interpretation highlight that along the offshore Capo Vaticano the slope-breaks associated with wave-built terraced formed during the LGM deepens from 130 m (cluster A) to 170 m (cluster B) below sea level (bsl) as one moves from southwest to the northeast, over a distance of 21 km (Fig. 1). Farther to the north, along the western flank of the Calabrian Arc, an average depth for the slope-breaks of 165 m is measured. Removal of the non tectonic component of vertical changes using an ice-volume equivalent eustatic sea-level compilation (LAMBECK et alii, 2011) indicates 15 (± 5) m of uplift and 25 (± 5) m of subsidence during the post-LGM for the southern and northern sectors offshore Capo Vaticano, respectively. The resulting average uplift and subsidence rates (both regional and local components) for the last 20 (± 2) k. y. are 0. 75 (± 0. 325) mm/y and 1. 25 (± 0. 375) mm/y, respectively. The integration of the new data with those available in the literature (e. g. TORTORICI et alii, 2003; CUCCI & TERTULLIANI, 2010; FERRANTI et alii, 2011) may provide information on fault kinematics and constraints on slip rates of tectonic structures that are relevant for earthquake hazard analysis of western Calabrian margin.

40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{geologic map}} of the Quaternary deposits, situated at the Southern half of the State of Espirito Santo coastal plain, is presented in this paper. They are represented by two generations of <b>wave-built</b> <b>terraces,</b> which have been originated after 123, 000 years and 5, 100 years B. P., by paleolagoonal deposits related to the last high sea-level period and by alluvial, coastal marsh and mangrove deposits of Holocene age.

40|$|<b>Wave-built</b> <b>terraces</b> formed during sea-level stillstands at depths {{lower than}} present are found along margins with fairly steep {{morphology}} and no- to ill-developed continental shelf, for instance {{the margin of}} volcanic islands. Terraces deposits are up to 20 - 30 m thick and are flat-topped with well-defined edges. They extend up to 1 km in dip section. The deposits are composed of intrabasinal sediments, mainly bioclastic sand and silt and are probably due to deposition below the storm wave-base during large-scale energy episodes. Two areas of the Tyrrhenian Sea have been analysed, one in a volcanic context (the Pontine archipelago) {{and the other in}} a highly active structural context (the Calabrian Arch). Similar <b>wave-built</b> <b>terraces</b> were found in both areas, with a main terrace placed at a depth of 100 - 150 m, which is thought to be Wurmian. Older terraces are also present, emplaced during the preceding lowstands in the Late Pleistocene. A possible present-day terrace is found at about 20 m depth in the Pontine archipelago. A mechanism of subsequent formation below wave base-level and removal because of sea level lowering has been hypothesised during long-lasting periods of Late Pleistocene sea level falls. Terraces are thus thought to preserve only at the minimum lowstand position and to remain relict on the slope during sea level rise and highstand. The analysis of the distribution and depths of these terraces allows some neotectonic interpretation. For example, in the volcanic archipelago, whose western sector has probably risen at an average rate of 2. 5 mm/yr over the last 20, 000 years...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Sediments {{deposited}} in transitional settings between shoreface and offshore lacustrine environments in the Pliocene Glenns Ferry Formation of the southwestern Snake River Plain include extensive nearshore oolitic sequences similar to <b>wave-built</b> <b>terraces</b> along Lake Bonneville described by Gilbert (1885). These sequences record both constructional and destructional phases. Constructional units formed during basinward progradation and avalanching of oolitic sediment from a shallow bench platform down a steeply-dipping bench slope. Reversed grading seen in proximal foresets and normal grading seen in distal foresets {{may have resulted}} from sediment transport by grain flow on {{the upper reaches of}} the slope and fluidized sediment flow on the lower slope surface. Foreset beds dip basinward to the northeast at 26 degrees, and foreset units attain thicknesses of 18 meters. Destructional episodes are recorded by missing sections within the tops of constructional units. Massive beds of thickly coated ooids overlie constructional units and record ooid formalion on the bench platform during transgressions which preceded progradation of subsequent foresets. The inlerpretation of these lacustrine bench sequences in terms of water depths during their formation demonstrates that rates of subsidence and absolute positions of lake level fluctuated greatly during their deposition. Such instability. probably related to tectonic movements. has had a significant influenc...|$|R
40|$|International audienceKamchatsky Peninsula {{lies within}} a complex meeting place of tectonic plates, in particular, the {{orthogonal}} {{interaction of the}} west-moving Komandorsky Island block with mainland Kamchatka. Examining the Holocene history of vertical deformation of marine <b>wave-built</b> <b>terraces</b> along the peninsular coast, we differentiated tectonic blocks undergoing uplift and tilting separated by zones of stable or subsided shorelines. We analyzed ∼ 200 excavations along > 30 coastal profiles and quantified vertical deformation on single profiles as well as along the coast using paleoshorelines dated with marker tephras. For the past ∼ 2000 yr, the average rates of vertical deformation range from about - 1 to + 7 mm/yr. Uplift patterns {{are similar to those}} detected from historical leveling and from mapping of the stage 5 e Quaternary marine terrace (ca. 120 ka). Average vertical deformation in the Holocene is highest for the shortest studied time period, from ca. A. D. 250 to 600, and it is several times faster than rates for marine oxygen isotope stage (MIS) 5 e terraces. Vertical displacements observed along the coast are most likely coseismic and probably have included subsidence as well as uplift events. Because subsidence is generally associated with erosion, almost surely more prehistoric large earthquakes occurred than are recorded as topographic steps in these terraces. We suggest that the distribution of coastal uplift and subsidence observed along the Kamchatsky Peninsula coastline is qualitatively explained by the squeezing of the Kamchatsky Peninsula block between the Bering and Okhotsk plates, and the Komandorsky Island block...|$|R
