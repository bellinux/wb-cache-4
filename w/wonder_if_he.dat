5|$|As {{the power}} and {{reputation}} of Pietro II grew, the Venetian people began to <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was secretly planning to establish a hereditary monarchy. Their fears were confirmed when his son, Otto Orseolo (named after Otto III), assumed the title of Doge upon Pietro II's death in 1009, thereby becoming the youngest Doge in Venetian history {{at the age of}} 16. Scandal marked much of Otto's reign as he showed a clear inclination toward nepotism by elevating several relatives to positions of power. In 1026, he was deposed by his enemies and exiled to Constantinople, but his successor, Pietro Barbolano, had such difficulty in attempting to unite the city that it seemed infighting would once again seize Venice.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Scully grows {{suspicious}} of Mulder when she thinks he may be helping a terrorist organization. Scully begins to <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> is now a traitor to the FBI. It is eventually revealed that Mulder is working as a mole in the group, and {{he is trying to}} stop them before they are able to use a biological weapon—that may have been created by members of the US government—which causes rapid degeneration of human flesh.|$|E
25|$|On every trip {{he brought}} along a chair made of birch and rawride where he would sit as he {{negotiated}} his business, while everyone else sat on the ground. Though {{it has been said}} he was illiterate, he had an excellent memory and kept his business records in his head without ever making a single note. He could sign his name with a flourish, so one must <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> actually was illiterate, or perhaps just keeping his business to himself.|$|E

25|$|On the {{positive}} side, having two engines was a built-in insurance policy. Many pilots made it safely back to base after having an engine failure en route or in combat. On 3 March 1944, the first Allied fighters reached Berlin on a frustrated escort mission. Lieutenant Colonel Jack Jenkins of 55FG led {{the group of}} P-38H pilots, arriving with only half his force after flak damage and engine trouble took their toll. On the way into Berlin, Jenkins reported one rough-running engine, causing him to <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> would ever make it back. The B-17s {{he was supposed to}} escort never showed up, having turned back at Hamburg. Jenkins and his wingman were able to drop tanks and outrun enemy fighters to return home with three good engines between them.|$|E
500|$|Season seven {{continues}} {{to develop the}} relationship between Liz and Criss (James Marsden), as the pair tries for children and considers getting married. Meanwhile, Jack attempts to improve his future prospects at the company, first by trying to [...] "tank" [...] NBC and convince Kabletown CEO Hank Hooper (Ken Howard) to sell it, and later by plotting to discredit Hooper's granddaughter and future CEO, Kaylee Hooper (Chloë Grace Moretz). Ultimately, however, he begins to <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> is truly happy. Elsewhere, Tracy has found success with his new movie studio, which produces comedy films mostly starring African American actors, in similar fashion to Tyler Perry; Jenna prepares to marry her longterm boyfriend Paul (Will Forte), and Kenneth has started a relationship with Hazel (Kristen Schaal), unaware that she is using him to get her moment on TGS.|$|E
500|$|In August, the {{preparations}} extended to laying depots; an early party established a depot [...] {{to the south}} of the main hut—a grotto in the ice known as Aladdin's Cave—but returned without the dogs. Mertz and two others set off to rescue the dogs, but in heavy winds covered less than a mile in two hours, and returned to the hut. [...] "If it depended only on me," [...] Mertz wrote in his diary, after four days' more wind confined them to the hut, [...] "we would be in our sleeping bags outside in the snow, and we would at least try to find the dogs. Mawson is definitely too cautious, and I <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> would show enough gumption during the sledging expedition." [...] The following day Mertz was part of a party of three that made it to Aladdin's Cave to rescue the dogs; when strong winds confined them to the depot for three days they spent the time expanding the cave.|$|E

500|$|Nitin Ganatra {{who plays}} Masood Ahmed {{explains}} to Digital Spy Masood's reactions when he discovers that Yusef has taken Kamil away. [...] "Masood goes crazy over this!" [...] Nitin replies. [...] "I've got kids myself, and I know I'd react {{the same way}} if I found out that some other guy had taken my child to somebody's house who the child doesn't even know. Masood is still {{the only person who}} can see Yusef for what he really is, so he goes into a blind panic over the situation. Masood calls in the police, and they make sure that Kamil is safe, but we're left to <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> will stay that way. The police say that they can't get involved in domestic disputes, so Masood says, 'Well, what about the father's rights? If a mother reported this, you'd see it as kidnap'. I thought that was a great line and really interesting - I think in that moment, Masood's representing a lot of fathers who have separated or divorced and don't have access to their children in the same way." ...|$|E
500|$|Rhys' mother, Elaine (Sancia Robinson), was {{introduced}} in November 2011. Barber revealed in his interview with Kilkelly that their backstory would be explored and stated that it would explain [...] "a lot more about why Rhys {{is the way he}} is". He added that there would be [...] "a big revelation" [...] about Elaine coming up. Elaine suffers from a degenerative spinal condition and has to use a wheelchair. Rhys was forced to care for her when his father ran out on them both. Rhys tries to keep his life on Ramsay Street separate from his family, so when Elaine asks him if she can spend Easter with him, he makes up excuses as to why she cannot visit him. Barber revealed to an Inside Soap writer that Elaine realises Rhys is lying to her and she starts to <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> is ashamed to be seen with her. Rhys' actions when his housemates arrive appear to confirm his mother's suspicions. While they wonder who Elaine is, he makes up an excuse. Barber explained [...] "Rhys pretends he's visiting one of his patients. Elaine is really hurt and embarrassed when he comes out with that. He realises, and feels terrible." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{day after}} the April 22, 2007 episode of The Sopranos titled [...] "Remember When" [...] aired, Losts co-creator Damon Lindelof met with fellow {{executive}} producer/writer/show runner Carlton Cuse and said that [...] "there's an actor on th show —I'm {{not going to tell}} you who he is—and I <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> has the same impression on you that he had on me". [...] Cuse correctly guessed Ken Leung, who had guest starred as one-time character Carter Chong, a young and angry mental patient. [...] In mid-May, they contacted Leung's agent and were informed in July that he was available and interested in working on Lost. [...] To limit the leak of spoilers, Lindelof and Cuse auditioned Leung with a character and scene created specifically for the audition that would not be used in the show but was [...] "analogous to the role [...] really want." [...] Leung believed that he was auditioning for the role of Russell, a [...] "brilliant mathematician" [...] in his late thirties with immense knowledge across various scientific fields, limited social skills and broken personal relationships. [...] Leung was the only actor who tried out for this part, as writers had written the role of Miles for him; had he not accepted the job, the character would have been completely rewritten. [...] The name Miles Straume was simply chosen because the writers thought that [...] "it would be cool if his name sounded like 'maelstrom' [...] ".|$|E

500|$|The Hollywood Reporters Todd McCarthy called Doctor Strange [...] "an engaging, smartly {{cast and}} {{sporadically}} eye-popping addition" [...] to the franchise, adding [...] "this action movie ostensibly {{rooted in the}} mind-expanding tenets of Eastern mysticism is different enough to establish a solid niche alongside the blockbuster combine's established money machines." [...] McCarthy, in addition to praising the acting, felt that there were certain sequences that [...] "go far beyond [...] in visual spectacle" [...] and that the time manipulation sequences, [...] "seen to outstanding advantage in 3D, [...] mind-trip-seeking audiences back in Doctor Strange's origin days would have called 'far-out' but today's fans will simply deem 'amazing'." [...] Peter Debruge of Variety called the film [...] "Marvel’s most satisfying entry since Spider-Man 2," [...] and wrote that despite having [...] "the same look, feel, and fancy corporate sheen" [...] as the other MCU films, it [...] "boasts an underlying originality and freshness missing from the increasingly cookie-cutter comic-book realm of late." [...] Debruge also praised the casting along with the multitude of visual effects the film was able to achieve. Alonso Duralde, reviewing for TheWrap said, [...] "True, Doctor Strange is an origin story, and occasionally hemmed in by the genre's narrative requirements, but it's smart enough to bring in great British actors to make the predictable paces and life lessons feel fresh and fascinating." [...] Regarding the film's visuals, Duralde praised them, exclaiming, [...] "In a year where bloated, empty spectacles have induced a crushing level of CG fatigue, this funny, freaky adventure reminds us of how effective VFX can be when they've got some imagination behind them." [...] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said, [...] "The giddily enjoyable Doctor Strange... is part of Marvel's strategy for world domination, yet it's also so visually transfixing, so beautiful and nimble that you may even briefly forget the brand. Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times said, [...] "Within the familiar narrative contours of the origin story, writer-director Scott Derrickson crams in enough out-of-body experiences, spatial-temporal shenanigans and dazzlingly kaleidoscopic visuals to make you <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> and his co-writers ... were dropping acid behind the scenes." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ruben Rosario of the Pioneer Press {{questions}} {{the motives of}} Kevin Gannon. [...] He states that Gannon has failed to provide any factual evidence {{that a group of}} killers exists, and that others, like reporter Kristi Piehl (the original reporter of Gannon and Duarte's theory), and some of the parents of the young men, who were at first encouraged by Gannon, now <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> isn't actually hurting the families who are trying to get over the loss of a child. [...] One of the parents, Bill Szostak, and Rosario even speculate that Gannon is out for either money or the notoriety and press attention. [...] Another parent, Kathy Geib, is working with Piehl and others, but their main goal now is just to get police to take a compulsory second look at cases of alcohol-related drownings.|$|E
2500|$|As the Guardians summary shows, {{even after}} the first 2012 release of Tony Badger's review, the FCO {{continued}} to deny the existence of documentation on the repeated British subversion of democracy in British Guiana in the 1950s and 1960s, though Richard Drayton, Rhodes Professor of Imperial History at King's College London, said this was simply not credible: [...] "When Kenyan historians requested documents in the past, they were told repeatedly by the FCO {{that they had been}} destroyed, only for the FCO, under judicial pressure, to yield them. It is to be hoped that the FCO will at some point 'discover' its British Guiana archive. Already, under my pressure, having asserted that it held no British Guiana materials whatsoever, the FCO has found one document which describes 'a formidable schedule of documents which the Governor of British Guiana sent home in April 1966 showing how the accountable documents in his custody were disposed of'." [...] Elkins agreed that it was [...] "frankly impossible, given that there were well-established procedures for handling archives at decolonisation by the 1960s. Warning bells should be going off." [...] Drayton also noted that the FCO [...] "refuses to make public the full inventory of the Hanslope Park archive. While we have full confidence in Professor Badger, many historians now <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was not handed an archive which, once again, had been screened and culled." [...] Drayton further mused that [...] "it was almost as if the material now made public had also been screened according to the same criteria applied c.1960—preventing potential prosecutions, protecting collaborators, and protecting the reputation of Britain." ...|$|E
