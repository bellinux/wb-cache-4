5|$|In the United Kingdom a {{total of}} 4100ha were planted <b>with</b> <b>bulbs,</b> of which 3800ha were Narcissi, the UK's most {{important}} bulb crop, much of which is for export, making this the largest global production centre, {{about half of the}} total production area. While some of the production is for forcing, most is for dry bulb production. Bulb production and forcing occurs in the East, while production in the south west is mainly for outdoor flower production. The farm gate value was estimated at £10m in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus {{writes that}} plants can grow spontaneously, from seed, or from {{vegetative}} {{parts of the}} plant. Plants <b>with</b> <b>bulbs</b> grow from those. Soil and climate influence growth. Some plants change into others unless care is taken, so bergamot turns into mint, and wheat turns into darnel. He reports that if celery is trodden after sowing, it will become curly, and that figs are the easiest trees to propagate, whereas date palms have to be grown from several seeds together, and they like irrigation, dung, salt (at the age of one year) and being transplanted. Other kinds of palm have different habits and fruits. He notes that gall insects come out of wild figs and make the cultivated figs swell, which helps to prevent premature shedding of the fruit. The male spathe of the date palm is cut off and brought to the female, and its dust is shaken over the female tree to make it fruit.|$|E

25|$|Fritillaria (fritillaries) is a genus {{of spring}} {{flowering}} herbaceous bulbous perennial {{plants in the}} lily family (Liliaceae). The type species, Fritillaria meleagris, was first described in Europe in 1571, while other species from the Middle East and Asia were also introduced to Europe at that time. The genus has about 130–140 species divided among eight subgenera. The flowers are usually solitary, nodding and bell-shaped <b>with</b> <b>bulbs</b> that have fleshy scales, resembling those of lilies. They {{are known for their}} very large genome size and genetically are very closely related to lilies. They are native to the temperate regions of the Northern hemisphere, from the Mediterranean and North Africa through Eurasia and southwest Asia to western North America. Many are endangered due to enthusiastic picking. The name Fritillaria is thought to refer to the checkered pattern of F. meleagris, resembling a box in which dice were carried. Fritillaries are commercially important in horticulture as ornamental garden plants and also in traditional Chinese medicine, which is also endangering a number of species. Fritillaria flowers have been popular subjects for artists to depict and as emblems of regions and organisations.|$|E
500|$|Gaga {{performed}} [...] "Dance in the Dark" [...] as {{the opening}} song of The Monster Ball Tour. The show began with Gaga appearing behind a giant, green laser lit video screen featuring scrim lights, in a futuristic silver jewelled jumpsuit <b>with</b> <b>bulbs</b> on it. She had matching eye makeup {{and wore a}} mask, beginning to sing [...] "Dance in the Dark", [...] "while dancers dressed in white balaclavas and white jumpsuits moved around her."

Jane Stevenson from Toronto Sun {{felt that it was}} not until Gaga had moved on to the next song after [...] "Dance in the Dark", that the Monster Ball [...] "was alive". In the revamped 2010-11 shows of The Monster Ball tour, the song was once again added as the opening song of the setlist, {{as a part of the}} segment titled [...] "City". Gaga performed it in a set, reminiscent of New York City night scene, with flickering neon signs displaying the words [...] "Ugly", [...] "Sexy" [...] and [...] "Liquor", fire escape stairwells and a broken yellow taxi.|$|E
60|$|It was the {{reverberation}} of {{this last}} sentence in my mind, I think, that sharpened my sentimental sympathy {{as we went}} through the straggling village street and across the trim green on our way back to London. It seemed that afternoon the most tranquil and idyllic collection of creeper-sheltered homes you can imagine; thatch still lingered on a whitewashed cottage or two, pyracanthus, wall-flowers, and daffodils abounded, and an unsystematic orchard or so was white with blossom above and gay <b>with</b> <b>bulbs</b> below. I noted a row of straw beehives, beehive-shaped, beehives of the type long since condemned as inefficient by all progressive minds, and in the doctor's acre of grass a flock of two whole sheep was grazing,--no doubt he'd taken them on account. Two men and one old woman made gestures of abject vassalage, and my uncle replied with a lordly gesture of his great motoring glove....|$|E

50|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, as gas {{lighting}} caught on, branched ceiling fixtures called gasoliers (a portmanteau {{of gas and}} chandelier) were produced, and many candle chandeliers were converted. By the 1890s, {{with the appearance of}} electric light, some chandeliers used both gas and electricity. As distribution of electricity widened, and supplies became dependable, electric-only chandeliers became standard. Another portmanteau word, electrolier, was formed for these, but nowadays they are most commonly called chandeliers. Some are fitted <b>with</b> <b>bulbs</b> shaped to imitate candle flames, for example those shown below in Epsom and Chatsworth, or <b>with</b> <b>bulbs</b> containing a shimmering gas discharge.|$|E

40|$|Endwall fillet and bulb {{structures}} are proposed {{in this research}} to improve the temperature uniformity of pin-fined microchannels. The periodical laminar flow and heat transfer performances are investigated under different Reynolds numbers and radius of fillet and bulb. The results show that at a low Reynolds number, both the fillet and the bulb structures strengthen the span-wise and the normal secondary flow in the channel, eliminate the high temperature area in the pin-fin, improve the heat transfer performance of {{the rear of the}} cylinder, and enhance the thermal uniformity of the pin-fin surface and the outside wall. Compared to traditional pin-fined microchannels, the flow resistance coefficient f of the pin-fined microchannels with fillet, as well as a <b>bulb</b> <b>with</b> a 2 μm or 5 μm radius, does not increase significantly, while, f of the pin-fined microchannels with a 10 μm or 15 μm bulb increases notably. Moreover, Nu has a maximum increase of 16. 93 % for those with fillet and 20. 65 % for those <b>with</b> <b>bulb,</b> and the synthetic thermal performance coefficient TP increases by 16. 22 % at most for those with fillet and 15. 67 % at most for those <b>with</b> <b>bulb.</b> At last, as the Reynolds number increases, heat transfer improvement of the fillet and bulb decreases...|$|R
