5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the last}} episode, Wirt and Greg wake up in a hospital, with Greg telling a story but being cut off before <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> what it's about. As the scene ends, Greg's frog begins to glow, due to having eaten a magic bell in The Unknown, {{suggesting}} that there was at least some physical aspect to the story. The series ends with a slow montage of how Wirt and Greg affected the inhabitants of the Unknown.|$|E
25|$|I deem it {{important}} to direct your attention to Article 2 of the Constitutional Amendments of the United States—'the {{right of the people}} to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.' This you should comply with immediately. Every (local) union should have a rifle club. I strongly advise you to provide every member with the latest improved rifle, which can be obtained from the factory at a nominal price. I entreat you to take action on this important question, so that in two years <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> the inspiring music of the martial tread of 25,000 armed men in the ranks of labor.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the case}} of sound waves {{travelling}} near the Earth's surface, the waves are diffracted or bent as they traverse by a geometric edge, such as a wall or building. [...] This phenomenon leads to a very important practical effect: [...] that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> [...] "around corners". [...] Because of the frequencies involved considerable amount of the sound energy (on the order of ten percent) actually travels into this would be sound [...] "shadow zone". [...] Visible light exhibits a similar effect, but, due to its much higher frequency, only a minute amount of light energy travels around a corner.|$|E

2500|$|... "Gens du pays" [...] {{has been}} called the {{unofficial}} national anthem of Quebec. Written by poet, songwriter, and avowed Quebec nationalist Gilles Vigneault (with music co-written by Gaston Rochon), it was first performed by Vigneault on June 24, 1975 during a concert on Montreal's Mount Royal at that year's Fête nationale du Québec ceremony. It quickly became a folk classic, and it has been played frequently at Fête nationale ceremonies since then. The chorus {{is by far the most}} famous part of the song: Gens du pays, c'est votre tour / De vous laisser parler d'amour, which, translated, says, [...] "Folks of the land, it is your turn to let yourselves talk of love." [...] At this time, Vigneault invited Quebecers to use this song when someone celebrate a birthday, changing [...] "Gens du pays" [...] by [...] "Mon cher (name)...". In many family, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> this song when the cake approaches.|$|E
2500|$|On 2007-12-17, Stewart Mandel, {{a writer}} for Sports Illustrated, {{revealed}} that Oklahoma's athletic director, Joe Castiglione had tried to arrange for Oklahoma to face the highest ranked opponent available, {{which would have been}} Virginia Tech, in the Orange Bowl. This would have pitted the #3 team against the #4 team. Big 12 Commissioner Dan Beebe contacted BCS officials (which includes the 11conference heads and the athletic director of Notre Dame) to see if this could be done. Michael Slive, then the BCS commissioner and SEC commissioner, considered the idea but it was ultimately rejected. There was no word on which officials voted against the proposition. Beebe stated he did not agree with the decision, but respected the views of those against it. Castiglione stated that he hopes [...] "at some point in time <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> an explanation of why this wasn't possible given the fact the rules provided the opportunity if it was in everybody's best interest." [...] Mandel said that two of his sources speculated that the commissioner [...] "feared such a matchup might damage the legitimacy of the Ohio State-LSU title game." [...] Slive said [...] "there weren't such compelling circumstances as to merit a change." ...|$|E
2500|$|A famous {{quotation}} of Clarke's {{is often}} cited: [...] "One {{of the great}} tragedies of mankind is that morality has been hijacked by religion." [...] He was quoted in Popular Science in 2004 as saying of religion: [...] "Most malevolent and persistent of all mind viruses. We should {{get rid of it}} as quick as we can." [...] In a three-day [...] "dialogue on man and his world" [...] with Alan Watts, Clarke stated that he was biased against religion and said that he could not forgive religions for what he perceived as their inability to prevent atrocities and wars over time. In his introduction to the penultimate episode of Mysterious World, entitled [...] "Strange Skies", Clarke said: [...] "I sometimes think that the universe is a machine designed for the perpetual astonishment of astronomers," [...] reflecting the dialogue of the episode, in which he stated this concept more broadly, referring to [...] "mankind". [...] Near the very end of that same episode, the last segment of which covered the Star of Bethlehem, he said that his favourite theory was that it might be a pulsar. Given that pulsars were discovered in the interval between his writing the short story, [...] "The Star" [...] (1955), and making Mysterious World (1980), and given the more recent discovery of pulsar PSR B1913+16, he said: [...] "How romantic, if even now, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> the dying voice of a star, which heralded the Christian era." ...|$|E

5000|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film {{two out of}} four stars and stated that [...] "cartoon {{violence}} is only funny in cartoons.
