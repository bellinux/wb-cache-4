25|$|Schwan {{belongs to}} the German {{tradition}} of social democratic opposition to Karl Marx's theories. In September 1974, {{she was one of}} the founding members of the Seeheimer Kreis, a conservative think tank within the SPD. She became a member of the SPD Grundwertekommission (Commission for Fundamental Values) in 1977. In 1984, she was removed from this position after criticizing the party's Ostpolitik as cooperating too closely with communist governments, while not engaging enough with dissidents. Rather she sought for support and dialog with those Eastern Europeans who <b>would</b> <b>dare</b> to criticize their governments. Schwan was reinstated in the Grundwertekommission in 1996. Since 2002, she has presided over the German-Polish Forum together with Janusz Reiter. In November 2004, the German government under Gerhard Schröder appointed her to the newly created office of the co-ordinator for cooperation with Poland (her counterpart on the Polish side was then Irena Lipowicz). She retained this position when the government changed and became headed by Christian Democrat Angela Merkel. In February 2009, she criticized Schröder for being too uncritical towards Vladimir Putin and too insensitive about Polish concerns about closer German-Russian ties.|$|E

Meanwhile, Elizabethan delivered a negative review, stating: [...] "No true country singer <b>would</b> <b>dare</b> do to a Hank Williams number what Frank Ifield {{has done to}} 'Lovesick Blues'." [...] The review finished by declaring that Ifield had [...] "none of Jim Reeves' depth and character, nor of the subtle melodic quality (of) Don Gibson."

500|$|Durkheim's {{views on}} crime were a {{departure}} from conventional notions. He believed that crime is [...] "bound up with the fundamental conditions of all social life" [...] and serves a social function. He stated that crime implies [...] "not only that the way remains open to necessary changes but that in certain cases it directly prepares these changes". Examining the trial of Socrates, he argues that [...] "his crime, namely, the independence of his thought, rendered a service not only to humanity but to his country" [...] as [...] "it served to prepare a new morality and faith that the Athenians needed". As such, his crime [...] "was a useful prelude to reforms". In this sense, he saw crime as being able to release certain social tensions and so have a cleansing or purging effect in society. He further stated that [...] "the authority which the moral conscience enjoys must not be excessive; otherwise, no-one <b>would</b> <b>dare</b> to criticize it, and it would too easily congeal into an immutable form. To make progress, individual originality {{must be able to}} express itself... the originality of the criminal... shall also be possible".|$|E

[...] In response to the film success, Frederick Herron of the Motion Picture Association of America wrote [...] "Hollywood is {{doing a very good}} work in selling the British Empire to the world." [...] Historian John Reid noted in his book Award-Winning Films of the 1930s that the film is considered [...] "one of the greatest adventure films of all time" [...] and highly praised Hathaway's work by saying [...] "the film really made his reputation." [...] It also received a praised review in Boys' Life magazine, starting off the review with the words [...] "You will be immensely pleased with The Lives of a Bengal lancer" [...] and went on to compare the style and class of the three main characters to that of The Three Musketeers. The film holds an overall approval rating of 100% on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 9 reviews, with a rating average of 8 out of 10.|$|E
500|$|Recorded in Monument's Nashville {{studios in}} early 1963, [...] "In Dreams" [...] peaked at number 7 on Billboard Hot 100 and spent 13 {{weeks on the}} charts in the U.S. During the five months the song was on the charts, Orbison {{replaced}} guitarist Duane Eddy {{on a tour of}} England. He was immensely popular in England, and shared billing with the Beatles, of whom he had never heard. English and Scottish promoters were wary of Orbison as a draw; he was not conventionally attractive or animated while performing, and they wondered if audiences would walk out. The tour sold out in one afternoon, however. Orbison's first meeting with John Lennon was awkward because Orbison was overwhelmed with the amount of advertising devoted to the Beatles when it was he who was supposed to headline the show. Beatlemania, however, was taking hold and Orbison accepted that he was not quite the main draw, so he decided to go first on stage. On opening night, the audience reacted intensely toward Orbison's ballads, as he finished with [...] "In Dreams". Philip Norman, a Beatles biographer, later wrote [...] "As Orbison performed, chinless and tragic, the Beatles stood in the wings, wondering how they <b>would</b> <b>dare</b> to follow him". After demanding Orbison play for double the time he was scheduled, the audience then screamed for a fifteenth encore, which Lennon and Paul McCartney refused to allow by holding Orbison back from re-entering the stage.|$|E

500|$|Returning to Britain {{to receive}} his medal from King George V at Buckingham Palace on 22 June 1915, O'Leary {{was given a}} grand {{reception}} attended by thousands of Londoners in Hyde Park on 10 July. He was also {{the subject of much}} patriotic writing, including a poem in the Daily Mail and the short play O'Flaherty V.C. by George Bernard Shaw. Tributes came from numerous prominent figures of the day, including Sir Arthur Conan Doyle who said that [...] "No writer in fiction <b>would</b> <b>dare</b> to fasten such an achievement on any of his characters, but the Irish have always had a reputation of being wonderful fighters, and Lance-Corporal Michael O’Leary is clearly one of them." [...] and Thomas Scanlan who said: [...] "I heard early this week of the great achievements of the Irish Guards. All Ireland is proud of O’Leary. He fully deserves the high honour that has been conferred upon him. Ireland is grateful to him." [...] His reception was repeated in Macroom when he visited Ireland, with crowds turning out to applaud him. Daniel O'Leary was interviewed in a local newspaper regarding his son's exploit but was reportedly unimpressed, commenting: [...] "I am surprised he didn't do more. I often laid out twenty men myself with a stick coming from Macroom Fair, and it is a bad trial of Mick that he could kill only eight, and he having a rifle and bayonet." ...|$|E

But Khrushchev is trying in vain... Under the leadership of the PLA, the Albanian people have scored historic victories in the course of these twenty years: they liberated the country from the fascist invaders and established the people's state power, reconstructed the war-ravaged country, liquidated the centuries-old backwardness and achieved great successes in the construction of socialist society... Our Party is fighting for a great cause, for the truth of Marxism-Leninism... On this course, marching shoulder to shoulder with the sister Marxist-Leninist parties and the fraternal peoples of the socialist countries, as well as with all the revolutionary forces of the world, our Party and people will score complete victory over the imperialist and revisionist enemies. Marxism-Leninism cannot be vanquished! Socialism and communism will triumph!" ...|$|E

[...] Variety's Brian Lowry praised the show for returning network HBO to top form, saying [...] "This is, quite simply, television at its finest, occupying a sweet spot that—for all the able competition—still remains unique to HBO: An expensive, explicit, character-driven program, tackling material no broadcast network or movie studio <b>would</b> <b>dare</b> touch...

[...] Roberto Bianco from USA Today said in his review that Boardwalk Empire was [...] "Extravagantly produced, shockingly violent and as cold and hard as ice, Boardwalk Empire {{brings us back to the}} world's former playground at the start of Prohibition—and brings HBO back to the forefront of the TV-series race." ...|$|E

500|$|Now {{he discovers}} that the self he chooses has a {{boundless}} multiplicity within itself inasmuch {{as it has}} a history, a history in which he acknowledges identity with himself. This history is of a different kind, for in this history he stands {{in relation to other}} individuals in the race, and to the whole race, and this history contains painful things, and yet he is the person he is only through this history. That is why it takes courage to choose oneself, for {{at the same time as}} he seems to be isolating himself most radically he is most radically sinking himself into the root by which he is bound up with the whole. This makes him uneasy, and yet it must be so, for when the passion of freedom is aroused in him-and it is aroused in the choice just as it presupposes itself in the choice-he chooses himself and struggles for this possession as for his salvation, and it is his salvation. Either/Or Part II, Hong, p. 216When a person turns and faces himself in order to understand himself, he steps, as it were, in the way of that first self, halts that which was turned outward in hankering for and seeking after the surrounding world that is its object, and summons it back from the external. In order to prompt the first self to this withdrawal, the deeper self lets the surrounding world remain what it is-remain dubious. This is indeed the way it is; the world around us is inconstant and can be changed into the opposite at any moment, and there is not one person who can force this change by his own might or by the conjuration of his wish. The deeper self now shapes the deceitful flexibility of the surrounding world in such a way that it is no longer attractive to the first self. Then the first self either must proceed to kill the deeper self, to render it forgotten, whereby the whole matter is given up; or it must admit that the deeper self is right, because to want to predicate constancy of something that continually changes is indeed a contradiction, and as soon as one confesses that it changes, it can of course, change in that same moment. However much that first self shrinks from this, there is no wordsmith so ingenious or no thought-twister so wily that he can invalidate the deeper self’s eternal claim. There is only one way out, and that is to silence the deeper self by letting the roar of inconstancy drown it out. Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses, 1845, Hong translation, p. 314Just as a man changes his clothes for celebration, so a person preparing for the holy act of confession is inwardly changed. It is indeed like changing one’s clothes to divest oneself of multiplicity in order to make up one’s mind about one thing, to interrupt the pace of busy activity in order to put on the repose of contemplation in unity with oneself. And this unity with oneself is the celebration’s simple festive dress that is the condition of admittance. Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits, Søren Kierkegaard, 1847, Hong, p.19If a person whose life has been tried in some crucial difficulty has a friend and sometime later he is unable to retain the past clearly, if anxiety creates confusion, and if accusing thoughts assail him with all their might as he works his way back, then he may go to his friend and say, [...] "My soul is sick so that nothing will become clear to me, but I confided everything to you; you remember it, so please explain the past to me again." [...] But if a person has no friend, he presumably goes to God if under other circumstances he has confided something to him, if in the hour of decision he called God as witness when no one understood him. [...] And the one who went to his friend perhaps was not understood at times, perhaps was filled with self-loathing, which is even more oppressive, upon discovering that the one to whom he had confided his troubles had not understood him at all, even though he had listened, had not sensed what was making him anxious, but had only an inquisitive interest in his unusual encounter with life. But this would never happen with God; who <b>would</b> <b>dare</b> to venture to think this of God, even if he is cowardly enough to prefer to forget God-until he stands face-to-face with the judge, who passes judgment on him but not on the one who truly has God as a witness, because where God is the judge, there is indeed no judge if God is the witness. It by no means follows that a person’s life becomes easy because he learns to know God in this way. On the contrary, it can become very hard; it may become more difficult than the contemptible easiness of sensate human life, but in this difficulty life also acquires ever deeper and deeper meaning.
