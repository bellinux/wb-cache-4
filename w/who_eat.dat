Those <b>who</b> <b>eat</b> a diet high in saturated fats and simple carbohydrates (mono- and disaccharide) have a higher risk. The Mediterranean diet's beneficial cardiovascular effect has been proposed as the mechanism of action.|$|E

5|$|Gout {{is due to}} {{elevated}} levels of uric acid in the blood. This occurs due {{to a combination of}} diet and genetic factors. At high levels, uric acid crystallizes and the crystals deposit in joints, tendons and surrounding tissues, resulting in an attack of gout. Gout occurs more commonly in those <b>who</b> <b>eat</b> a lot of meat, drink a lot of beer, or are overweight. Diagnosis of gout may be confirmed by seeing the crystals in joint fluid or tophus. Blood uric acid levels may be normal during an attack.|$|E
50|$|When the suffix -o is used, {{instead of}} -a, then the participle {{refers to a}} person. A manĝanto is someone <b>who</b> is <b>eating.</b> A manĝinto is someone <b>who</b> <b>ate.</b> A manĝonto is someone <b>who</b> will <b>eat.</b> Also, a manĝito is someone <b>who</b> was <b>eaten,</b> a manĝato is someone <b>who</b> is being <b>eaten,</b> and a manĝoto is someone <b>who</b> will be <b>eaten.</b>|$|R

The team that eats the most calories wins $5,000. Members from only three couples give in to temptation: Mallory, <b>who</b> <b>eats</b> 210 calories; Paul (Yellow Team), <b>who</b> <b>eats</b> 912 calories; and Mark, <b>who</b> <b>eats</b> 925 calories. The Black Team wins the $5,000 by 13 calories.|$|R

To die well we must live well, is a {{familiar}} platitude. Morality is, of course, best promoted by the good quality of our fare, but quantitative excellence {{is by no means}} to be despised. Cæteris paribus, the man <b>who</b> <b>eats</b> much is a better Christian than the man <b>who</b> <b>eats</b> little, and he <b>who</b> <b>eats</b> little will pursue a more uninterrupted course of benevolence than he <b>who</b> <b>eats</b> nothing.

5|$|Red maple is a {{good choice}} of a tree for urban areas when there is ample room for its root system. Forming an {{association}} with Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi can help A. rubrum grow along city streets. It is more tolerant of pollution and road salt than Sugar Maples, although the tree's fall foliage is not as vibrant in this environment. Like several other maples, its low root system can be invasive and it makes a poor choice for plantings near paving. It attracts squirrels, <b>who</b> <b>eat</b> its buds in the early spring, although squirrels prefer the larger buds of the silver maple.|$|E
5|$|The {{long-term}} use of supplemental vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D or vitamin E does not {{reduce the risk}} of lung cancer. Some studies suggest that people <b>who</b> <b>eat</b> diets with a higher proportion of vegetables and fruit tend to have a lower risk, but {{this may be due to}} confounding—with the lower risk actually due to the association of a high fruit/vegetables diet with less smoking. Several rigorous studies have not demonstrated a clear association between diet and lung cancer risk, although meta-analysis that accounts for smoking status may show benefit from a healthy diet.|$|E
5|$|Turbinellus floccosus is {{poisonous}} to {{some people}} <b>who</b> <b>eat</b> it, but has been consumed without incident by others. Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea may occur, though are sometimes delayed by up to 8–14 hours. A tricarboxylic acid known as α-tetradecylcitric acid {{may be responsible for}} the extreme gastrointestinal symptoms. Laboratory experiments showed it increased tone of guinea pig smooth muscle of the small bowel (ileum), and that when given to rats, it led to mydriasis, skeletal muscle weakness, and central nervous system depression. Turbinellus floccosus contains more than double the amount of this acid than the related T. kauffmanii.|$|E

Lulu is usually called lulu-khorkhore (bogeyman <b>who</b> <b>eats</b> everything up). The threat is generally used to make small children eat their meals.|$|R
5|$|When {{they live}} in {{polluted}} waters, bivalve molluscs {{have a tendency to}} accumulate substances such as heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants in their tissues. This is because they ingest the chemicals as they feed but their enzyme systems are not capable of metabolising them and as a result, the levels build up. This may be a health hazard for the molluscs themselves, and is one for humans <b>who</b> <b>eat</b> them. It also has certain advantages in that bivalves can be used in monitoring the presence and quantity of pollutants in their environment.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, an {{estimated}} 45million people were {{infected with the}} beef tapeworm Taenia saginata and 3million with the pork tapeworm Taenia solium. Infection of the digestive system by adult tapeworms causes abdominal symptoms that are unpleasant but not disabling or life-threatening. However, neurocysticercosis resulting from penetration of T. solium larvae into {{the central nervous system}} is the major cause of acquired epilepsy worldwide. In 2000, about 39 million people were infected with trematodes (flukes) that naturally parasitize fish and crustaceans, but can pass to humans <b>who</b> <b>eat</b> raw or lightly cooked seafood. Infection of humans by the broad fish tapeworm Diphyllobothrium latum occasionally causes vitamin B12 deficiency and, in severe cases, megaloblastic anemia.|$|E
5|$|Ingestion of {{metallic}} lead, such {{as small}} lead fishing lures, increases blood lead levels {{and can be}} fatal. Ingestion of lead-contaminated food is also a threat. Ceramic glaze often contains lead, and dishes that have been improperly fired can leach the metal into food, potentially causing severe poisoning. In some places, the solder in cans used for food contains lead. When manufacturing medical instruments and hardware, solder containing lead may be present. People <b>who</b> <b>eat</b> animals hunted with lead bullets {{may be at risk}} for lead exposure. Bullets lodged in the body rarely cause significant levels of lead, but bullets lodged in the joints are the exception, as they deteriorate and release lead into the body over time.|$|E

5|$|Vegetables play an {{important}} role in human nutrition. Most are low in fat and calories but are bulky and filling. They supply dietary fiber and are important sources of essential vitamins, minerals, and trace elements. Particularly important are the antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E. When vegetables are included in the diet, there is found to be a reduction in the incidence of cancer, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and other chronic ailments. Research has shown that, compared with individuals <b>who</b> <b>eat</b> less than three servings of fruits and vegetables each day, those that eat more than five servings have an approximately twenty percent lower risk of developing coronary heart disease or stroke.|$|E

25|$|Pollution of the Hudson River {{is largely}} due to dumping of PCBs by General Electric from 1947 to 1977. GE dumped an {{estimated}} 1.3 million pounds of PCBs into the Hudson River during these years.

25|$|Breastfeeding or {{introduction}} of gluten while breastfeeding don't protect against celiac disease among at-risk children. Breast milk of healthy human mothers <b>who</b> <b>eat</b> gluten-containing foods presents {{high levels of}} non-degraded gliadin (the main gluten protein). Early {{introduction of}} traces of gluten in babies to potentially induce tolerance doesn't {{reduce the risk of}} developing celiac disease. Delaying the introduction of gluten does not prevent, but is associated with a delayed onset of the disease.|$|E
25|$|U.S. {{government}} scientists tested fish in 291 streams {{around the}} country for mercury contamination. They found mercury in every fish tested, according to the study by the U.S. Department of the Interior. They found mercury even in fish of isolated rural waterways. Twenty five percent of the fish tested had mercury levels above the safety levels determined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for people <b>who</b> <b>eat</b> the fish regularly. The largest source of mercury contamination in the United States is coal-fueled power plant emissions.|$|E
25|$|The most {{discussed}} {{pollution of}} the Hudson River is General Electric's {{contamination of the}} river with Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) between 1947 and 1977. This pollution caused a range of harmful effects to wildlife and people <b>who</b> <b>eat</b> fish from the river or drink the water. In response to this contamination, activists protested in various ways. Musician Pete Seeger founded the Hudson River Sloop Clearwater and the Clearwater Festival {{to draw attention to}} the problem. The activism led to the site being designated as one of the superfund sites.|$|E

25|$|There {{has been}} much {{research}} on whether eating prior to a cognitive recall test can affect cognitive functioning. One example was {{a study of the}} effect of breakfast timing on selected cognitive functions of elementary school students. Their results found that children <b>who</b> <b>ate</b> breakfast at school scored notably higher on most of the cognitive tests than did students <b>who</b> <b>ate</b> breakfast at home and also children <b>who</b> did not <b>eat</b> breakfast at all.|$|R
25|$|Together, {{phytoplankton}} and zooplankton make {{up most of}} the plankton in the sea. Plankton is {{the term}} applied to any small drifting organisms that float in the sea (Greek planktos = wanderer or drifter). By definition, organisms classified as plankton are unable to swim against ocean currents; they cannot resist the ambient current and control their position. In ocean environments, the first two trophic levels are occupied mainly by plankton. Plankton are divided into producers and consumers. The producers are the phytoplankton (Greek phyton = plant) and the consumers, <b>who</b> <b>eat</b> the phytoplankton, are the zooplankton (Greek zoon = animal).|$|E
25|$|Common causes include poor {{absorption}} {{from the}} stomach or intestines, decreased intake, and increased requirements. Decreased absorption {{may be due}} to pernicious anemia, surgical removal of the stomach, chronic inflammation of the pancreas, intestinal parasites, certain medications, and some genetic disorders. Decreased intake may occur in those <b>who</b> <b>eat</b> a vegan diet or are malnourished. Increased requirements occur in HIV/AIDS and in those with rapid red blood cell breakdown. Diagnosis is typically based on vitamin B12 blood levels below 120–180 picomol/L (170–250 pg/mL) in adults. Elevated methylmalonic acid levels (values >0.4 micromol/L) may also indicate a deficiency. A type of low red blood cells known as megaloblastic anemia is often but not always present.|$|E
25|$|Aromatic amines are {{chemicals}} that are produced when {{products such as}} dyes, polyurethane products, and certain pesticides are made. They are also found in cigarette smoke, fuel exhaust, and in over cooked, burned meat. The three types of aromatic amines monocyclic, polycyclic, and heterocyclic have all been found in recent studies of breast health. Monocyclic amines {{have been found to}} cause mammary cancer in rats. Studies have shown that women <b>who</b> <b>eat</b> higher amounts of overcooked meat, meaning more exposure to heterocyclic amines, have also been diagnosed with more post-menopausal breast cancer. Heterocyclic amines also have the ability to copy estrogen and in laboratory studies have been found to encourage the growth of cancerous tumors on human tissue.|$|E
