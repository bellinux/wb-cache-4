In Inuit mythology, the least weasel is credited with both great wisdom and courage, and <b>whenever</b> <b>a</b> mythical Inuit hero wished to accomplish a valorous task, he would generally change himself into a least weasel. According to Matthew Hopkins, a witch hunter general during the English Civil War, least weasels were the familiars of witches.|$|E

5|$|Condor bones {{have been}} found in Native American graves, as have condor feather headdresses. Cave {{paintings}} of condors have also been discovered.

Some scientists, such as Noel Snyder, believe that this process of making ceremonial clothing contributed to the condor's decline.|$|E
5|$|However, it {{is highly}} {{unlikely}} that single-story structures such as mobile homes can have a substantial effect on tornado development or evolution. More people are killed in trailer parks because mobile homes are less able to withstand high winds than permanent structures. Winds which can demolish or roll a mobile home may only cause roof damage to a typical one- or two-family permanent residence. Another likely contributing factor to the continued propagation of this myth is confirmation bias: <b>whenever</b> <b>a</b> new instance of a tornado hitting a mobile home park occurs, media outlets report on it more extensively, ignoring damage to the surrounding area which may not have produced as many casualties.|$|E

5|$|Qwak! is a single-player duck hunting light gun shooter arcade game {{developed}} by Atari, Inc. and released in November 1974. In the game, ducks fly {{one at a}} time across the screen, and the player shoots at them using a light gun attached to the game cabinet. The player gets three shots per duck; ducks change direction away from missed shots and fall {{to the bottom of the}} screen when hit. A screen overlay adds images of reeds and a tree branch, and an image of a duck is added to a row at the top of the screen <b>whenever</b> <b>a</b> duck is hit. Games continue until a time limit, set by the machine operator, is reached.|$|E

Jack's rival, Devon Banks (Will Arnett), complicates the situation by threatening to publicly ridicule Jack if the show loses money. Jack, under pressure, begins to interfere with Liz's appearance, sending her over the edge with insecurity. After 510 takes, they finally settle on an opening title to the show. After Liz locks herself in her dressing room, Jack shuts Dealbreakers down, but manages to break even by selling the show's opening titles; in future, <b>whenever</b> <b>a</b> television show is playing in the background of a Sheinhardt Universals soap opera, the Dealbreakers titles will be shown.|$|E
5|$|According to Lloyd, OC ReMix {{has grown}} {{steadily}} over the years, {{in terms of}} both visitors and submissions. Influxes of new visitors happened <b>whenever</b> <b>a</b> piece about the site was published on a news site such as Slashdot and Electronic Gaming Monthly. The site has been covered by sites such as Electronic Gaming Monthly, G4techTV, PC Gamer magazine, 1UP.com, Game Informer, Ars Technica, Minnesota Public Radio, Hyper magazine, and others. OC ReMix does not advertise or market itself, though OverClocked ReMix makes appearances at fan conventions; its first was Otakon 2006 in Baltimore, Maryland. In April 2008, Lloyd and Oji joined Six Apart's Anil Dash, MetaFilter's Matt Haughey, Reddit's Alexis Ohanian and FARK.com's Drew Curtis for a panel discussion on virtual communities at Internet meme convention, ROFLCon, co-sponsored by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Beginning in 2008, OC ReMix promotional CDs have been given away as contest prizes at every performance of orchestral game music concert series, Video Games Live at the invitation of composer and series co-creator Tommy Tallarico; ReMixes were played in the concert hall before the show at the June 29 and June 30, 2007 Kennedy Center performances in Washington, D.C.|$|E

5|$|Benny Chan {{described}} the filming process {{as some of}} the darkest days of his career, explaining that the baby was a factor beyond his control, and could not work more than eight hours a day. <b>Whenever</b> <b>a</b> scene involving the baby was shot, the crew members had to be silent, communicating in sign language. Benny Chan stated it took time, patience, and money to guide the baby through each shot, and numerous retakes were required due to the baby's constant crying and napping. As a result, production went over budget. Special methods were sometimes used to coax the baby into co-operation. One scene required the baby to suckle Chan's nipple. The baby was initially hesitant, but relented after the crew brushed a large amount of honey onto the nipple.|$|E
5|$|From time to time, Henry's royal court {{became a}} magnum concilium, a great council; these were {{sometimes}} {{used to take}} major decisions but the term was loosely applied <b>whenever</b> <b>a</b> large number of barons and bishops attended the king. A great council was supposed to advise the king and give assent to royal decisions, although {{it is unclear how}} much freedom they actually enjoyed to oppose Henry's intentions. Henry also appears to have consulted with his court when making legislation; the extent to which he then took their views into account is unclear. As a powerful ruler, Henry was able to provide either valuable patronage or impose devastating harm on his subjects. Using his powers of patronage, Henry was very effective at finding and keeping competent officials, including within the Church, in the 12th century a key part of royal administration. Indeed, royal patronage within the Church provided an effective route to advancement under Henry and most of his preferred clerics eventually became bishops and archbishops. Henry could also show his ira et malevolentia—"anger and ill-will"—a term that described his ability to punish or financially destroy particular barons or clergy.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, the {{practice}} was most prevalent from the medieval era until the outbreak of World War I, but evidence of intermarriage between royal dynasties {{in other parts of}} the world can be found as far back as the Late Bronze Age. Monarchs were often in pursuit of national and international aggrandisement on behalf of themselves and their dynasties, thus bonds of kinship tended to promote or restrain aggression. Marriage between dynasties could serve to initiate, reinforce or guarantee peace between nations. Alternatively, kinship by marriage could secure an alliance between two dynasties which sought to reduce the sense of threat from or to initiate aggression against the realm of a third dynasty. It could also enhance the prospect of territorial acquisition for a dynasty by procuring legal claim to a foreign throne, or portions of its realm (e.g., colonies), through inheritance from an heiress <b>whenever</b> <b>a</b> monarch failed to leave an undisputed male heir.|$|E
