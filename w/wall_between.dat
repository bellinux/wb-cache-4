5|$|In 1709, {{the main}} fort at Viborg {{consisted}} of five frontal bastions named Holtz, Neuport, Klein-Platform, Wasserport and Eleonora, connected by the Viborg town wall, {{in the eastern}} section of the town. The {{western part of the}} town, connected to the main section, had three bastions named Valport, Pansarlax, and Europa. To the west of the <b>wall</b> <b>between</b> Pansarlax and Europa, there was a ravelin and two caponiers, and {{to the west of the}} <b>wall</b> <b>between</b> Evrop and Eleonora was another ravelin. Both ravelins were, apparently, earthen, but inside the main eastern fort, all structures were stone. Most of the structures in the western part of the fort were wooden, with the exception of the stone guard tower, named the Petersburg tower. Separate from these fortifications, on the small central island east of the town (now the Zamochnyy Island), was Schloss (Castle) Viborg, which stands to this day. The fort had 151 guns at its defense.|$|E
5|$|Next to it, but {{higher up}} and almost inaccessible, are two cells; then a well; and, thirdly, a small vihara, with three cells, {{two of them}} with stone-beds. Some rough cutting on the back <b>wall</b> <b>between</b> the cell-doors resembles a dagoba in low relief, but it is quite unfinished. Outside are two more cells and a chamber or chapel {{at the end of}} a veranda that runs along in front both of the vihara and the cells.|$|E
5|$|Within {{a year of}} the enquiry, almost 100 cells {{had been}} {{enlarged}} by knocking down the inner <b>wall</b> <b>between</b> two cells, and a classification system was introduced. Internal walls were constructed in the main block, creating four separate divisions. Following the urgings of the prison Superintendent George and various official enquiries, new workshops were built to provide increased useful employment for prisoners. Five spaces were designed for tailors, bookbinders, shoemakers, mat makers and painters.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} domain <b>walls</b> <b>between</b> topologically ordered phases in two spatial dimensions. We {{present a}} method {{which allows for}} {{the determination of the}} superselection sectors of excitations of such walls and which leads to a unified description of the kinematics of a wall and the two phases to either side of it. This incorporates a description of scattering processes at domain walls which can be applied to questions of transport through walls. In addition to the general formalism, we give representative examples including domain <b>walls</b> <b>between</b> the Abelian and non-Abelian topological phases of Kitaev’s honeycomb lattice model in a magnetic field, as well as recently proposed domain <b>walls</b> <b>between</b> spin polarized and unpolarized non-Abelian fractional quantum Hall states at different filling fractions...|$|R
5|$|Geoffrey and Maud's oldest granddaughter, Joan, married Roger Mortimer in 1301, giving Mortimer {{control of}} Ludlow Castle. Around 1320, Roger built the Great Chamber block {{alongside}} the existing Great Hall and Solar complex, copying what {{was becoming a}} popular tripartite design for domestic castle buildings in the 14th century; an additional building was also constructed by Roger on {{the location of the}} later Tudor Lodgings, and the Guardrobe Tower was added to the curtain <b>wall.</b> <b>Between</b> 1321 and 1322 Mortimer found himself on the losing side of the Despenser War and, after being imprisoned by Edward II, he escaped from the Tower of London in 1323 into exile.|$|E
5|$|The 17th-century room, S2, {{used the}} south {{wall of the}} {{existing}} structure as its own north wall, and was largely built using materials salvaged from S1, although the standard of the work was poorer. The new room had a double fireplace, {{but there was no}} evidence of a dividing <b>wall</b> <b>between</b> the two hearths. Limestone blocks, identical to the quoins in S1, were used as structural and decorative features in the fireplace. In addition to the pantiles taken from S1, there were Cornish slate roof tiles. Whether they formed part of the roof of S2 or were associated with the possible wooden extension is unclear.|$|E
5|$|The Phra Thinang Mahisorn Prasat (พระที่นั่งมหิศรปราสาท) {{is a small}} {{pavilion}} {{built on}} the <b>wall</b> <b>between</b> the Siwalai Garden and the Maha Monthien buildings. The pavilion has a mondop style roof and a gilded spire, decorated in glass mosaic. The pavilion was built by King Rama IV as a monument to his father King Rama II. After its completion the ashes of King Rama II was moved and was housed in the pavilion. After the death of King Rama IV the ashes was {{moved back to the}} Ho Phra That Monthien Buddha Image Hall, currently the pavilion houses several Buddha images.|$|E

5|$|The {{ground floor}} contains, {{in the west}} section, the former dining room and kitchen. The {{openings}} in the <b>wall</b> <b>between</b> the billiard room and the garden room had been blocked up but the rooms were reconnected in the 19th century under Sir William Henry Cope, uncovering an original doorway with a four-centred pointed arch. Cope applied arabesque patterns to the panelling in the garden room, which he had traced when two of the bedrooms were being repainted. The billiard room has a hidden door leading to the original entrance {{on the north side}} of the house through the Foxley gatehouse into the interior courtyard, and several doorways remain in the kitchen and housekeeping areas.|$|E
5|$|The main approach, {{from the}} north, is defended by earthworks, {{comprising}} three ditches, with a rampart, or earthen <b>wall,</b> <b>between.</b> Also outside the castle walls is a vaulted passage, traditionally said to lead into the castle, {{but in fact}} accessing an 18th-century ice house. There are no openings within {{the lower part of}} the castle's walls, excepting the entrance and the postern, or side gate, to the west, although there are relatively large windows on the upper storeys. Windows in the south wall suggest that further buildings were intended within the courtyard, but were never built. The stonework is of coursed sandstone rubble, with dressings in lighter Ballengeich stone.|$|E
5|$|The spiral {{staircase}} {{to the second}} floor is original. The floor continues the two-room design, and the roof, largely a post-war replacement with only a few surviving medieval timbers, is intended to resemble the original medieval design. The fireplace and windows are original, as probably is the 14th-century wooden door to the floor. Both the <b>wall</b> <b>between</b> the two rooms, and its stone doorway, were built in the 18th century. The room contains a display {{on the history of the}} tower, and some of the original wooden foundations of the building.|$|E

5|$|The west {{facade of}} the house is the most ornate, and faces the Hudson River, {{with a view of the}} river from its terrace and west-facing windows. The curtain <b>wall</b> <b>between</b> the facade's pavilions {{contains}} a semicircular portico, and its entablature is upheld by Ionic columns, and supports a balustrade. A flight of semicircular steps descends to the terrace. The river front is parallel with the east front, which had a porte-cochère, a minor entrance, and a service entrance. The main entrance is at the building's south, directly approached by the south drive. The entrance is recessed, with a portico of Ionic columns over the entranceway.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the show}} faced {{criticism}} from viewers for not intervening when a meerkat was injured and faced death, as a whole, Meerkat Manor enjoyed considerable success and was Animal Planet's top series in October 2007, {{both on the}} cable channel and through its video-on-demand service. The show's experimental format broke new ground in animal documentary filming techniques and allowed viewers a long term, intimate look {{into the lives of}} its meerkat stars, breaking the traditional <b>wall</b> <b>between</b> viewer and subject found with most documentaries. In 2007, Meerkat Manor was nominated for two Primetime Emmy Awards. It has won three awards at the 2006 Omni Awards, and at the 2006 and 2007 New York Festivals Award Galas. The first three series of the programme have been released to DVD in both Region 1 and Region 2. In 2007, a book entitled Meerkat Manor – The Story of Flower of the Kalahari was released in the UK, detailing the life of Flower and the Whiskers before the series' filming began. A television film, , documenting Flower's birth and rise to matriarch of the Whiskers aired on Animal Planet on 25 May 2008.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} racing lap, Vettel led by 2.8 seconds from Webber, who was {{followed}} by Alonso, Rosberg, Hamilton, Massa, Button, Schumacher, Kubica, Hülkenberg, Sutil, Barrichello, Kobaysahi, Heidfeld, Alguersari, Liuzzi, Buemi, Glock, Petrov, Kovalainen, Yamamoto, Trulli, Senna and di Grassi. Alonso chose a cautious approach and lost four to five seconds while building up his pace slowly in the early stages. Sutil ran off the circuit but continued after losing his position to both Williams drivers. Webber lost grip on the next lap after running across the outside kerbing and spinning across the track onto the <b>wall</b> <b>between</b> turns twelve and thirteen; he slid back onto the circuit and collected Rosberg, forcing both drivers to retire. The debris on-track from the accident called the safety car to be deployed. Kobayashi, Petrov, Heidfeld and Buemi all made pit stops for intermediate tyres during the safety car period.|$|E
