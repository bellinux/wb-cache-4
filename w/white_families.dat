5|$|Another {{aspect of}} the double burden in Africa {{is that there is}} class divide, meaning that most <b>white</b> <b>families,</b> {{including}} poor ones, employ Africans either as a live-in worker or a part-time worker. In addition, because of the urban house shortage, oftentimes relatives and friends are given room and board in exchange for unpaid work, alleviating work for some.|$|E
5|$|In late 1945, Little {{returned}} to Boston, {{where he and}} four accomplices committed a series of burglaries targeting wealthy <b>white</b> <b>families.</b> In 1946, he was arrested while picking up a stolen watch he had left at a shop for repairs, and in February began serving an eight-to-ten-year sentence at Charlestown State Prison for larceny and breaking and entering.|$|E
5|$|In early 1860, Ross {{enlisted in}} Captain J. M. Smith's Waco company of Texas Rangers, which formed {{to fight the}} renegade Native Americans. Smith {{appointed}} Ross his second lieutenant. When Smith was promoted, the other men in the company unanimously voted to make Ross the new captain. In conjunction with several other Ranger companies, Ross led his men to retaliate against a Kickapoo tribe which had murdered two <b>white</b> <b>families.</b> The tribe had been warned of the Rangers' approach and set the prairie ablaze. The Rangers were forced to abandon their mission when confronted with the massive wildfire.|$|E

5|$|Many Portuguese colonials {{were not}} typical {{settlers}} in Mozambique. While most European communities in Africa {{at the time}} - {{with the possible exception}} of Afrikaners - were established from the late nineteenth to early twentieth centuries, some <b>white</b> <b>families</b> and institutions in those territories still administered by Portugal had been entrenched for generations. Loss of their privileged status and fears of FRELIMO reprisal resulted in an exodus of up to 200,000 white civilians at independence (in Europe they were popularly known as retornados). Cities, towns and villages saw their Portuguese names changed after independence - Lourenço Marques to Maputo, Vila Pery to Chimoio, Vila Cabral to Lichinga, or Vila Junqueiro to Gurúè.|$|E
5|$|Riel was {{the eldest}} of eleven {{children}} in a locally well-respected family. His father, who was of Franco-Ojibwa Métis descent, had gained prominence in this community by organizing a group that supported Guillaume Sayer, a Métis imprisoned for challenging the HBC's historical trade monopoly. Sayer's eventual release due to agitations by Louis Sr.'s group effectively ended the monopoly, and the name Riel was therefore {{well known in the}} Red River area. His mother was the daughter of Jean-Baptiste Lagimodière and Marie-Anne Gaboury, one of the earliest <b>white</b> <b>families</b> to settle in the Red River Settlement in 1812. The Riels were noted for their devout Catholicism and strong family ties.|$|E
5|$|The {{family moved}} to the Transvaal when Makeba was a child. After her father's death, {{she was forced to}} find employment; she did {{domestic}} work, and worked as a nanny. She described herself as a shy person at the time. Her mother worked for <b>white</b> <b>families</b> in Johannesburg, and had to live away from her six children. Makeba lived for a while with her grandmother and a large number of cousins in Pretoria. Makeba was influenced by her family's musical tastes; her mother played several traditional instruments, and her elder brother collected records, including those of Duke Ellington and Ella Fitzgerald, and taught Makeba songs. Her father played the piano, and his musical inclination was later a factor in Makeba's family accepting what was seen as a risque choice of career.|$|E

5|$|During the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) tour of South Africa during 1948–49, {{the first}} under apartheid, the BBC {{commentator}} John Arlott was horrified {{when he saw}} a black man assaulted for no reason. This prompted him to visit several townships where he found black people living in very poor conditions. He contrasted this unfavourably with the luxury of the homes where he was entertained by <b>white</b> <b>families.</b> Billy Griffith, one of the touring team, accompanied him on one visit to a township, and was similarly appalled, but did not speak out against it. Arlott later condemned apartheid, during a 1950 BBC broadcast, and refused to commentate during future tours to the country. His example was followed by the England batsman and clergyman David Sheppard, who declined to tour South Africa, refused to play the team in 1960, and spoke out publicly against the policies of the South African government despite efforts by the MCC to silence him. Otherwise, there was little protest in England against South African cricket during the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Seymour and {{his small}} group of new {{followers}} soon relocated {{to the home of}} Richard and Ruth Asberry at 216 North Bonnie Brae Street. <b>White</b> <b>families</b> from local holiness churches began to attend as well. The group would get together regularly and pray to receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit. On April 9, 1906, after five weeks of Seymour's preaching and prayer, and three days into an intended 10-day fast, Edward S. Lee spoke in tongues for the first time. At the next meeting, Seymour shared Lee's testimony and preached a sermon on Acts 2:4 and soon six others began to speak in tongues as well, including Jennie Moore, who would later become Seymour's wife. A few days later, on April 12, Seymour spoke in tongues for the first time after praying all night long.|$|E
5|$|Slavery {{did not end}} in New York State until July 4, 1827, and, {{like many}} men of his day, Stanton's father was a slaveowner. Peter Teabout, a slave in the Cady {{household}} who was later freed in Johnstown, took care of Stanton and her sister Margaret. While she {{makes no mention of}} Teabout's position as a slave in her family's household, he is remembered with particular fondness by Stanton in her memoir, Eighty Years & More. Among other things, she reminisces about the pleasure she took in attending the Episcopal church with Teabout, where she and her sisters enjoyed sitting with him {{in the back of the}} church rather than alone in front with the <b>white</b> <b>families</b> of the congregation. It seems it was, however, not immediately the fact that her family owned at least one slave, but her exposure to the abolition movement as a young woman visiting her cousin, Gerrit Smith, in Peterboro, New York, that led to her staunch abolitionist sentiments.|$|E

5|$|White owned {{a number}} of {{antiques}} and pieces of furniture of historical interest. Among these were items once possessed by Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron including a pair of andirons with heavy brass heads and a fender, possibly used at Lord Fairfax's Greenway Court estate. White also had a richly inlaid table made of several types of wood, which once belonged to his grandfather, Virginia judge Robert White. Beneath the table's framework was pasted a small slip of paper on which Robert White signed his name and the date, 1789. Historian Hu Maxwell noted the similarity between the handwriting of White, his father John Baker White, and his grandfather Robert White. White also owned a sugar bowl from Switzerland that had originated in China and {{had been in the}} possession of the Streit and <b>White</b> <b>families</b> for over two centuries.|$|E
25|$|As unrest {{spread to}} other parts of the city, many middle class <b>white</b> <b>families</b> who {{employed}} blacks in their homes as live-in cooks and servants were accosted by white rioters.

Many <b>white</b> <b>families</b> complied, and those who refused were subjected to attacks and vandalism in turn.|$|E
