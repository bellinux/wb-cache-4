5|$|At about 13:15, an {{air attack}} by German Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters and Junkers Ju 88 bombers sank both destroyers within minutes. <b>Wryneck</b> {{launched}} her whaler, and each destroyer launched her three Carley floats. Survivors in the whaler set off east past Cape Maleas, towing two Carley floats and their occupants. In the evening the wind increased, causing the floats {{to strike the}} boat, so Waldron reluctantly cast them adrift.|$|E
5|$|Holkham's north-facing coastal {{location}} {{can attract}} {{large numbers of}} migrating birds in autumn if the weather conditions are right, especially with a north to north-east wind. The common species may {{be accompanied by a}} <b>wryneck,</b> red-backed shrike or greenish warbler in August, with goldcrests, thrushes and finches later in the season, and perhaps red-breasted flycatchers and yellow-browed warblers. Vagrant rarities such as Pallas's, Radde's or dusky warblers may occur; a red-breasted nuthatch in 1989 was the first, and, as of 2012, the only individual of its species to be recorded in the UK.|$|E

5|$|Near {{the mouth}} of the Argolic Gulf a Staffel of nine Luftwaffe Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive-bombers from Jagdgeschwader 77 {{attacked}} the convoy at either 06:45 or 07:15. Slamat was hit, set afire and began to abandon ship. Calcutta ordered Diamond to go alongside Slamat to rescue survivors {{while the rest of the}} convoy continued to try to reach Souda Bay in Crete. At 08:15 Diamond reported that she was still rescuing survivors and still under air attack. By then three destroyers had reinforced the convoy so Calcutta sent one of them, , to assist Diamond. Slamat was afire from stem to stern when Diamond fired a torpedo that sank her in a coup de grâce. Diamond reported at 09:25 that she had rescued most of the survivors and was proceeding to Souda Bay. An hour later <b>Wryneck</b> signalled a request for aircraft cover.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{history of this}} group is not well documented, but the known fossils allow some preliminary conclusions: the earliest known modern picids were piculet-like forms of the Late Oligocene, about 25 million years ago (mya). By that time, however, the group was already present in the Americas and Europe, and it is hypothesized that they actually evolved much earlier, maybe {{as early as the}} Early Eocene (50 mya). The modern subfamilies appear to be rather young by comparison; until the mid-Miocene (10–15 mya), all picids seem to have been small or mid-sized birds similar to a mixture between a piculet and a <b>wryneck.</b> On the other hand, there exists a feather enclosed in fossil amber from the Dominican Republic, dated to about 25 mya, which seems to indicate that the Nesoctitinae were already a distinct lineage by then.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of woodpeckers are sedentary {{but there are}} a few examples of migratory species such as the rufous-bellied woodpecker and yellow-bellied sapsucker, and the Eurasian <b>wryneck</b> breeds in Europe and west Asia and migrates to the Sahel in Africa in the winter. More northerly populations of Lewis's woodpecker, northern flicker, Williamson's sapsucker, red-breasted sapsucker and red-naped sapsucker all move southwards in the fall in North America. Most woodpecker movements can be described as dispersive, such as when young birds seek territories after fledging, or eruptive, to escape harsh weather conditions. Several species are altitudinal migrants, for example the grey-capped woodpecker, which moves to lowlands from hills during the winter months. The woodpeckers that do migrate do so during the day.|$|E

5|$|Woodpeckers do {{not have}} such {{a wide range of}} songs and calls as do {{passerine}} birds, and the sounds they make tend to be simpler in structure. Calls produced include brief high-pitched notes, trills, rattles, twittering, whistling, chattering, nasal churrs, screams and wails. These calls are used by both sexes in communication and are related to the circumstances of the occasion; these include courtship, territorial disputes and alarm calls. Each species has its own range of calls, which tend to be in the 1 to 2.5 kHz range for efficient transmission through forested environments. Mated couples may exchange muted, low-pitched calls, and nestlings often issue noisy begging-calls from inside their nest cavity. The wrynecks have a more musical song and in some areas, the song of the newly arrived Eurasian <b>wryneck</b> is considered to be the harbinger of spring. The piculets either have a song consisting of a long descending trill, or a descending series of two to six (sometimes more) individual notes, and this song alerts ornithologists to the presence of the birds, as they are easily overlooked.|$|E
25|$|Three bombs hit <b>Wryneck.</b> The first {{exploded}} on her port side and damaged her hull; {{the second and}} third hit her engine room and bridge. Her Commissioned Engineer, Maurice Waldron, shut down her boilers and brought on deck a wounded Australian officer whom he had been looking after and put him in a Carley float. <b>Wryneck</b> capsized to port but managed to launch her whaler and three Carley floats before she sank in 10–15 minutes.|$|E
25|$|The last living {{survivor}} from Slamat, Royal Army Service Corps veteran George Dexter, {{states that}} after <b>Wryneck</b> was sunk he {{and three other}} men were rescued by Orion.|$|E
25|$|<b>Wrynecks</b> Commissioned Engineer, Maurice Waldron, took {{command of}} her whaler and she set off east past Cape Maleas, towing two Carley floats and their occupants. In the evening the wind increased, causing the floats {{to strike the}} boat, so Waldron reluctantly cast them adrift.|$|R
60|$|Foremost were borne, on {{the wrists}} of the actors, the birds {{especially}} sacred to the goddess--doves and sparrows, <b>wrynecks</b> and swallows; {{and a pair}} of gigantic Indian tortoises, each ridden by a lovely nymph, showed that Orestes had not forgotten one wish, at least, of his intended bride.|$|R
5|$|Woodpeckers, piculets and <b>wrynecks</b> all possess {{characteristic}} zygodactyl feet, {{consisting of}} four toes, the first (hallux) {{and the fourth}} facing backward and {{the second and third}} facing forward. This foot arrangement is good for grasping the limbs and trunks of trees. Members of this family can walk vertically up a tree trunk, which is beneficial for activities such as foraging for food or nest excavation. In addition to their strong claws and feet, woodpeckers have short, strong legs. This is typical of birds that regularly forage on trunks. Exceptions are the black-backed woodpecker and the American and Eurasian three-toed woodpeckers, which have only three toes on each foot. The tails of all woodpeckers, except the piculets and <b>wrynecks,</b> are stiffened, and when the bird perches on a vertical surface, the tail and feet work together to support it.|$|R
25|$|Against Luidinga's argument, {{the troop}} ship Khedive Ismail survived whereas the destroyers Diamond and <b>Wryneck</b> were sunk. And had the convoy been 20 {{nautical}} miles further south, Vendetta, Waterhen and <b>Wryneck</b> could have met it at 0800 instead of 0915 hrs, increasing both its anti-aircraft fire and capacity to rescue survivors. The distance from Almyros allowed the same Stukas to make repeated attack runs, although {{on the flight}} back to base one stopped at Corinth to refuel. Increasing their round trip by 40 nautical miles might have marginally reduced the aircraft's ability to attack repeatedly.|$|E
25|$|Diamond {{accompanied}} by <b>Wryneck</b> returned to Slamat, arriving about 1100 hrs. They found two lifeboats from Slamat and rescued their occupants. Slamat was afire from stem to stern, and Diamond fired a torpedo at her port side that sank {{her in a}} coup de grâce. By now Diamond carried about 600 of Slamats survivors, including Captain Luidinga.|$|E
25|$|Nearly 1,000 {{people were}} killed in the loss of Slamat, Diamond and <b>Wryneck.</b> Of the 500 or so {{soldiers}} that Slamat embarked, eight survived. Of her complement of 193 crew and 21 Australian and New Zealand DEMS gunners and NZEF Medical Corps, 11 survived. Of Diamonds 166 complement, 20 survived. Of Wrynecks 106 crew, 27 survived.|$|E
50|$|The family Picidae {{has four}} subfamilies, the Picinae (woodpeckers), the Picumninae (piculets), the Jynginae (<b>wrynecks)</b> and the {{monotypic}} Nesoctitinae (Antillean piculet). Based on morphology and behaviour, the Picumninae {{was considered to}} be the sister clade of the Picinae. This has now been confirmed by phylogenetic analysis and the Jynginae are placed basal to the Picinae, Nesoctitinae and Picumninae.|$|R
50|$|Like {{the true}} woodpeckers, <b>wrynecks</b> have large heads, long tongues which {{they use to}} extract their insect prey and zygodactyl feet, with two toes {{pointing}} forward, and two backwards. However, they lack the stiff tail feathers that the true woodpeckers use when climbing trees, so {{they are more likely}} than their relatives to perch on a branch rather than an upright trunk.|$|R
50|$|The little {{woodpecker}} (Veniliornis passerinus) is {{a species of}} bird in the family Picidae, the woodpeckers, piculets, and <b>wrynecks.</b> It is found {{in a wide range}} of wooded habitats in a large part of South America east of the Andes, and generally common. Unlike other similar and comparably sized members of the genus Veniliornis, the {{little woodpecker}} lacks a contrasting yellow nape.|$|R
25|$|Lt Cdr Philip Cartwright, who {{commanded}} Diamond, {{was on a}} Carley float {{but gave}} his place to a sailor {{who was in the}} water. Cartwright was not seen again. Several men in the Carley floats died either from wounds or from drowning in the swell. They included Lt Cdr Robert Lane who commanded <b>Wryneck,</b> and Dr G.H. Brand who was the civilian ship's doctor on Slamat.|$|E
25|$|About 1315 hrs a Staffel of Ju 87 bombers {{came out}} of the sun in a {{surprise}} attack on the two destroyers. Two bombs damaged Diamond, destroyed both of her lifeboats and sank her in eight minutes. Three bombs hit Wryneck; she capsized to port and sank in 10–15 minutes. <b>Wryneck</b> launched her whaler and each destroyer launched her three Carley floats. Several men in the Carley floats died either from wounds or from drowning in the swell.|$|E
25|$|The rest of {{the convoy}} kept moving, while Calcutta rescued some {{survivors}} and ordered the destroyer Diamond to rescue more. At 0815 hrs Diamond was still rescuing survivors and still under attack. At 0916 hrs three destroyers from Crete reinforced the convoy, so Calcutta sent one of them, , to assist Diamond. At 0925 hrs Diamond reported that she had rescued most of the survivors and was heading for Souda Bay. <b>Wryneck</b> reached Diamond about 1000 hrs and requested aircraft cover at 1025 hrs.|$|E
50|$|Arboreal woodpeckers, which {{depend on}} their tails—particularly the strong central pair of rectrices—for support while they feed, have a unique tail moult. Rather than {{moulting}} their central tail feathers first, as most birds do, they retain these feathers until last. Instead the second pair of rectrices (both R2 feathers) {{are the first to}} drop. (In some species in the genera Celeus and Dendropicos, the third pair is the first dropped.) The pattern of feather drop and replacement proceeds as described for passerines (above) until all other rectrices have been replaced; only then are the central tail rectrices moulted. This provides some protection to the growing feathers, since they're always covered by at least one existing feather, and also ensures that the bird's newly strengthened tail is best able to cope with the loss of the crucial central rectrices. Ground-feeding woodpeckers, such as the <b>wrynecks,</b> do not have this modified moult strategy; in fact, <b>wrynecks</b> moult their outer tail feathers first, with moult proceeding proximally from there.|$|R
25|$|Birds that prey upon slugs include common {{blackbirds}} (Turdus merula), starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), rooks (Corvus frugilegus), jackdaws (Corvus monedula), owls, vultures and ducks. Studies on slug predation also cite fieldfares (feeding on Deroceras reticulatum), redwings (feeding on Limax and Arion), thrushes (on Limax and Arion ater), {{red grouse}} (on Deroceras and Arion hortensis), game birds, <b>wrynecks</b> (on Limax flavus), rock doves and charadriiform birds as slug predators.|$|R
2500|$|Pridham-Wippell {{sent the}} {{destroyer}} [...] {{to the position}} in the Argolic Gulf where Slamat had been lost. Griffin found 14 survivors in two Carley floats. At 0240 hrs she reported the rescue, said both destroyers had been sunk about 1330 hrs {{and she was still}} looking for <b>Wrynecks</b> whaler. In the morning she found more floats and another four survivors. She took the survivors to Crete.|$|R

Slamat had a mixed crew of 84 Goans, 74 Dutch, 24 Chinese, 10 Australians and a Norwegian. The 11 survivors were six Goans, four Dutch and one other.|$|E
25|$|British and Commonwealth {{troops and}} naval {{personnel}} who {{were lost in}} the sinking of Slamat, Diamond and <b>Wryneck</b> are named on the Commonwealth War Graves Commission's Athens Memorial in Phaleron War Cemetery at Palaio Faliro southeast of Athens.

George Dexter commissioned a monument to all the service personnel lost when the three ships were sunk. It is in The Royal British Legion Club, Shard End, Birmingham.|$|E
25|$|Diamond {{accompanied}} by <b>Wryneck</b> returned to Slamat, arriving about 1100 hrs. The destroyers found Slamats No. 10 and No. 4 lifeboats, {{both of which}} had been righted. They rescued 30 troops and two Dutch crew from No. 10 and Slamats Second Officer and several other survivors from No. 4. Slamat was afire from stem to stern, and Diamond fired a torpedo at her port side that sank her in a coup de grâce.
