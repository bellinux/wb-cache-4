5|$|As {{it turned}} out, maybe Hadl {{had led him}} {{to believe that we}} had come down to reach some sort of {{monetary}} settlement with him. And it was really funny because it was not <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> expecting and his reaction was shock.|$|E
5|$|I am not {{too sure}} if John {{actually}} fully understood <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> saying. He {{knew he was}} onto something when he saw those words and turned them into a song. But to have experienced what the lyrics in that song are actually about? I don't know if he fully understood it.|$|E
5|$|After the {{location}} filming, production {{went back to}} soundstages for interiors. Some scenes were shot against a green screen background for second unit footage of other locations to be substituted, allowing the use of crane shots. With the photography done, Moore took the film to South Korea to edit to prevent Disney from finding out; he also refused to tell most of his close friends <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing. Visual effects were done by the same company there that had done them for the 2006 South Korean monster film, The Host.|$|E

5|$|Before 1932, the Cipher Bureau {{had succeeded}} in solving an earlier Enigma machine that functioned without a plugboard, but had been {{unsuccessful}} with the Enigma I, a new standard German cipher machine that was coming into widespread use. In late October or early November 1932, {{the head of the}} Cipher Bureau's German section, Captain Maksymilian Ciężki, tasked Rejewski to work alone on the German Enigma I machine {{for a couple of hours}} per day; Rejewski was not to tell his colleagues <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing.|$|E
5|$|He gave a {{magnificent}} speech. He {{is one of}} the cleverest speakers I have ever heard. The questions on the Mundt-Nixon bill, his views on the loyalty oath, and the problem of international communism were just <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> waiting for. Indeed, he was so skillful—and, I might add, cagey—that those who came indifferent were sold, and even many of those who came to heckle went away with doubts... If he is only a fraction as effective as he was here you have a formidable opponent on your hands.|$|E
5|$|Morrison {{entered a}} {{classroom}} {{on the second}} floor, room 206, where teacher Sandra Smith taught Honors English. When Smith asked him <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing in the classroom, {{he pulled out his}} handgun and ordered her, all of the male students, and several female students to leave. He then fired one shot into the air after Smith tried to speak to him again. After Smith and the male students left the classroom, Morrison instructed the seven remaining students to stand facing the chalkboard. He later released one student at approximately 12:15 p.m., before law enforcement arrived at the scene.|$|E

5|$|One {{important}} piece of advice Yamamoto gave Kurosawa was that a good director needed to master screenwriting. Kurosawa soon realized that the potential earnings from his scripts were much higher than <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> paid as an assistant director. Kurosawa would later write or co-write all of his own films. He also frequently wrote screenplays for other directors such as for the antiwar film director Satsuo Yamamoto's film, A Triumph of Wings (Tsubasa no gaika, 1942). This outside scriptwriting would serve Kurosawa as a lucrative sideline lasting well into the 1960s, long after he became world-famous.|$|E
5|$|Scull appealed his {{conviction}} to the U.S. Supreme Court. In a unanimous ruling in May 1959, {{the high court}} held in Scull v. Virginia ex rel. Comm. on Law Reform and Racial Activities that the conviction violated Scull's 14th Amendment rights to due process because the committee's inquiry was so vague and so confusing that Scull could not tell <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> being asked.|$|E
5|$|Terry George was {{the first}} {{director}} to join the project, and he also did some revisions to the script, but he soon left the project. Peter Berg was the next director to consider, but he too, eventually dropped out for undisclosed reasons. A year later {{it was confirmed that}} Phillip Noyce would direct. Noyce was attracted to Salt for its espionage themes, which are present in most of his filmography, as well as the tension of a character who tries to prove his innocence yet also does <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> previously accused of.|$|E

25|$|Within theistic mysticism {{two broad}} tendencies can be identified. One is a {{tendency}} to understand God by asserting <b>what</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> not and the other by asserting <b>what</b> <b>He</b> <b>is.</b> The former leads to what is called apophatic theology and the latter to cataphatic theology.|$|R

5|$|The DVD's special {{features}} include {{an interview with}} Wiseau, who is asked questions by an off-screen Greg Sestero. Wiseau sits {{directly in front of}} a fireplace, with a mantel cluttered by various props from the film; next to him sits a large framed theatrical poster for the film. A few of Wiseau's answers are dubbed in, although it is evident that the dubbed responses match <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> originally saying. Wiseau fails to answer several of the questions, instead offering non sequiturs.|$|E
5|$|The game's soundtrack was {{composed}} by Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka. Tanaka was {{a video game}} composer working for Nintendo who had previously composed for games such as Super Mario Land and Metroid, while Suzuki was a composer and musician for bands of many different genres. The NES was only able to play three notes at a time, which Suzuki has noted greatly limited <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> able to produce, as he could not create some of the sounds he wanted.|$|E
5|$|With the Oilers {{unwilling to}} pay <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> expecting, Brewer {{decided to go}} to salary {{arbitration}} to get a new contract. However, on August 4, 2004, Brewer signed a one-year, $2.65 million contract with the Oilers, avoiding his arbitration hearing set for only a few days later. Brewer was unable to play out his new contract due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout.|$|E

5|$|Around 03:00, Hatanaka was {{informed}} by Lieutenant Colonel Masataka Ida that the Eastern District Army {{was on its}} way to the palace to stop him, and that he should give up. Finally, seeing his plan collapsing around him, Hatanaka pleaded with Tatsuhiko Takashima, Chief of Staff of the Eastern District Army, to be given at least ten minutes on the air on NHK radio, to explain to the people of Japan <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> trying to accomplish and why. He was refused. Colonel Haga, commander of the 2ndRegiment of the First Imperial Guards, discovered that the Army did not support this rebellion, and he ordered Hatanaka to leave the palace grounds.|$|E
5|$|Despite his bluster, Kutuzov {{knew from}} dispatches that his army {{had been too}} badly hurt to fight a {{continuing}} action the following day. He knew exactly <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing: by fighting the pitched battle, he could now retreat with the Russian army still intact, lead its recovery, and force the weakened French forces to move even further from their bases of supply. The dénouement became a textbook example of what a hold logistics placed upon an army far from its center of supply. On September8, the Russian army {{moved away from the}} battlefield in twin columns to Semolino, allowing Napoleon to occupy Moscow and await for 5 weeks a Russian surrender that would never come.|$|E
5|$|Harmony (Laura San Giacomo) {{succeeds in}} convincing Keith that their {{relationship}} is not immoral. Vinnie Van Lowe (Ken Marino) enters Mars Investigations and tells Keith {{that he needs}} to know the whereabouts of Kendall Casablancas. Afterwards, he blackmails Keith by showing him pictures of him and Harmony, saying that Keith must pay $4,000 to prevent the information from being shown to Harmony’s husband. Veronica gets exasperated with Meryl when she feels that Meryl refuses to see the truth about Sully cheating on her. Veronica talks to the professor about his affair with Mindy O’Dell, but he says that he’ll give her the scholarship no matter what. After seeing Meryl and Scarlett hug, Veronica tries to frame Mercer to no avail. After showing Logan the evidence that Mercer is innocent, he tells Veronica <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing: they were in Tijuana, and Mercer set a room on fire. There were girls in Mercer’s room, but Logan ran away when the fire spread.|$|E

5|$|His {{work on the}} X-Men {{franchise}} {{would continue}} {{with a number of}} covers for The New Mutants and The Uncanny X-Men in 1986 and 1987, respectively. He also drew all but three of the first 23 covers and interior frontispieces to Classic X-Men from 1986 to 1988. His interior X-Men-related work included a two-issue run on X-Factor and the one-shot , both in 1989, and three Uncanny X-Men Annuals, in 1986, 1988 and 1990. It was in drawing the 1988 annual that Adams says he felt like a professional comic book artist for the first time, as he first felt confident that he knew <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing.|$|E
5|$|Navarro {{stated that}} he filed suit against Chinchay, who first {{represented}} Van der Sloot during his interrogation, charging her with abuse of authority, conspiracy to commit a crime, and misrepresentation {{because he did not}} find her name on the list of public defenders from Peru's Ministry of Justice. Navarro also filed a complaint against Van der Sloot's translator, insisting that he misrepresented himself as an official translator of the Dutch embassy. Chinchay rejected the claims against her, stating that Van der Sloot had selected her as a private attorney after declining another defense attorney appointed by the state. She contradicted his claims that he did not understand <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> signing by stating {{that she was able to}} speak with him in perfect Spanish. She said that Van der Sloot was interested in talking about the Holloway case, thinking that it might get him extradited to Aruba. Chinchay also said that when she told Van der Sloot that she noticed he was signing various documents with very different signatures, he signaled for her to be quiet.|$|E
5|$|Tchaikovsky {{remained}} friendly {{but never}} intimate {{with most of}} The Five, ambivalent about their music; their goals and aesthetics did not match his. He took pains to ensure his musical independence from {{them as well as}} from the conservative faction at the Conservatory—an outcome facilitated by his acceptance of a professorship at the Moscow Conservatory offered to him by Nikolai Rubinstein, Anton's brother. When Rimsky-Korsakov was offered a professorship at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, it was to Tchaikovsky that he turned for advice and guidance. Later, when Rimsky-Korsakov was under pressure from his fellow nationalists for his change in attitude on music education and his own intensive studies in music, Tchaikovsky continued to support him morally, told him that he fully applauded <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing and admired both his artistic modesty and his strength of character. In the 1880s, long after the members of The Five had gone their separate ways, another group called the Belyayev circle took up where they left off. Tchaikovsky enjoyed close relations with the leading members of this group—Alexander Glazunov, Anatoly Lyadov and, by then, Rimsky-Korsakov.|$|E
