Hezbollah {{played a significant role}} in the Lebanese civil war, opposing American forces in 1982–83 and opposing Amal and Syria during the 1985–88 War of the Camps. However, Hezbollah's early primary focus was ending Israel's occupation of southern Lebanon following Israel's 1982 invasion and siege of Beirut. Amal, the main Lebanese Shia political group, initiated guerrilla warfare. In 2006, former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak stated, [...] "When <b>we</b> <b>entered</b> Lebanon … there was no Hezbollah. We were accepted with perfumed rice and flowers by the Shia in the south. It was our presence there that created Hezbollah".|$|E

Programmer Shigeki Morimoto stated that part of why development took {{three and a half years}} was due to being a small team of only four programmers, [...] "We were very greedy in terms of all the features we wanted to include in the games". Ishihara declared that Gold and Silver were supposed to be the last in the series – [...] "I didn’t intend to make any more Pokémon titles.

500|$|Many critics responded very {{positively}} to Inside No. 9. After the final {{episode of the}} first series, the comedic critic Bruce Dessau said on his website that it had [...] "really set an early benchmark to beat for comedy of the year. It has been consistently compelling as each week <b>we</b> <b>entered</b> an entirely different world." [...] On the same day, David Chater, writing in The Times, said of the series as a whole that [...] "t's hard to know which to admire more – the rich and perverse imaginations of Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith or the extraordinary range of acting talent that has brought this strange and memorable series to life." [...] Chater had previously described [...] "A Quiet Night In", the second episode of Inside No. 9, as [...] "the funniest, cleverest, most imaginative and original television I have seen {{for as long as}} I can remember – one of those fabulous programmes where time stands still and the world around you disappears". Mark Jones (The Guardian) considered the whole series, saying that the Inside No. 9 was [...] "never less-than-captivating", while a review in the Liverpool Echo described every episode as [...] "intriguing and lovingly-crafted", though it was felt that the first three episodes were stronger than the latter three. In December 2014, Metro television critic Keith Watson named Inside No. 9 the twentieth best television programme of 2014, and in January 2015, Daily Star Sunday columnist Garry Bushell named Inside No. 9 the best comedy TV programme of 2014.|$|E

2500|$|Yield {{management}} is a variable pricing strategy, based on understanding, anticipating and influencing consumer behavior {{in order to}} maximize revenue or profits from a fixed, time-limited resource (such as airline seats or hotel room reservations or advertising inventory). As a specific, inventory-focused branch of revenue management, yield management involves strategic control of inventory to sell the right product to the right customer at the right time for the right price. This process can result in price discrimination, in which customers consuming identical goods or services are charged different prices. Yield {{management is}} a large revenue generator for several major industries; Robert Crandall, former Chairman and CEO of American Airlines, gave yield management its name and has called it [...] "the single most important technical development in transportation management since <b>we</b> <b>entered</b> deregulation." ...|$|E

By the beginning of 1997, {{it was clear to}} Soros Fund Management that the discrepancy between the trade account and the capital account was becoming untenable. We sold short the Thai baht and the Malaysian ringgit early in 1997 with maturities ranging from six months to a year. (That is, <b>we</b> <b>entered</b> into contracts to deliver at future dates Thai baht and Malaysian ringgit that we did not currently hold.) Subsequently Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia accused me of causing the crisis, a wholly unfounded accusation. We were not sellers of the currency during or several months before the crisis; on the contrary, we were buyers when the currencies began to decline—we were purchasing ringgits to realize the profits on our earlier speculation. (Much too soon, as it turned out. We left most of the potential gain on the table because we were afraid that Mahathir would impose capital controls. He did so, but much later.) ...|$|E

Nobody there noticed our presence, they were already all asleep. <b>We</b> <b>entered</b> through the {{unlocked}} door into the building where the women were sleeping, and woke them up, telling them quietly to get dressed at once, as {{they were to be}} taken to a safe place because of the possibility of an armed attack. They obeyed silently. We tied their hands behind their backs there and then, blindfolded them, and let them out to the cart, which was already waiting by the school, sat them in it, and sent them off to their destination. After that, we went into the room occupied by the men. We told them the same story as we had told the women. The young princes Konstantinovich (KR's sons) and Prince Paley also obeyed meekly. We took them out into the corridor, blindfolded them, bound their hands behind their backs, and put them in another cart. We had earlier decided that the carts should not go together. The only one to try to oppose us was Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich. Physically he was stronger than the rest. We had to grapple with him. He told us categorically {{that he was not going}} anywhere, as he knew they all were going to be killed. He barricaded himself behind the cupboard and our efforts to get him out were in vain. We lost precious time. I finally lost my patience and shot at the Grand Duke. However, I only fired with the intention of wounding him slightly and frightening him into submission. I wounded him in the arm. He did not resist further. I bound his hand and covered his eyes. We put him in the last cart and set off. We were in a great hurry: already the dawn was heralding morning. Along the way, Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich again repeated that he knew they were all going to be killed. “ Tell me why? He asked. “ I have never been involved in politics. I loved sports, played billiards, and was interested in numismatics. “ I reassured him as best as I could. although I was very agitated myself by everything I have been through that night. Despite his wounded arm, the Grand Duke did not complain. At last, we arrived at the mine. The shaft was not very deep and as it turned out had a ledge on one side that was not covered by water.” ...|$|E
