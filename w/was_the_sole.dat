5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Western Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sole</b> {{successor}} of the Roman Empire. Charlemagne's imperial coronation in 800 put strain on Western relations with the Byzantine Empire ruled from Constantinople. When Otto I became emperor in February 962, there was contention between him and the Byzantine Empire, and this issue revived in 967 between Otto and Nikephoros II Phokas over the dominion of Italy. On 25 December 967, Pope John XIII anointed Otto II as Otto I's co-emperor.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{resolution}} {{was not as}} strong as Mason had liked—he wanted Virginia to threaten to cut off tobacco—Mason worked in the following years for non-importation. The repeal of most of the Townshend duties (excepting that on tea) made his task more difficult. In March 1773, his wife Ann died of illness contracted after another pregnancy. Mason <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sole</b> parent to nine children, and his commitments made him even more reluctant to accept political office that would take him from Gunston Hall.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the fall}} of the authoritarian {{government}} in Portugal in 1974, the Spanish government <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sole</b> surviving dictatorship in Western Europe, where several countries in 1975 were ruled by socialist parties which had long loathed Franco for coming to power by overthrowing a socialist democracy. Hostility to the use of capital punishment was widespread in Western Europe at this time and most Western European countries had ceased using it.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} the African river martin <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sole</b> member of its genus and {{subfamily}} until {{the discovery of}} the white-eyed river martin, Pseudochelidon eurystomina, by Thai ornithologist Kitti Thonglongya in 1968. Although some authorities follow Brooke in placing that species in a separate genus Eurochelidon due to its significant differences from the African species, it remains a member of the same subfamily. Genetic studies confirmed that the two river martins form a distinct clade from the typical swallows in the Hirundininae subfamily.|$|E

5|$|In {{his early}} career Redding mostly covered songs from popular artists, such as Richard, Cooke and Solomon Burke. Around the mid-1960s he began writing his own songs—always taking along his cheap red {{acoustic}} guitar—and sometimes asked for Stax members' opinion of his lyrics. He often worked on lyrics with other musicians, such as Simms, Rodgers, Huckaby, Phil Walden and Cropper. During his recovery from his throat operation, Redding wrote about 30 songs in two weeks. Redding <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sole</b> copyright holder {{on all of}} his songs.|$|E
