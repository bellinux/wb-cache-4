5|$|In 1641, Harvard University sent three preachers to England {{to raise}} money for missionary {{activities}} among the Indians. To support the fund-raising, the University produced one of the earliest fund-raising brochures, New England's First Fruits. An early version of the press release was used when King's College (now Columbia University), sent out an announcement of its 1758 graduation ceremonies and several newspapers printed the information. Princeton was the first university to make it a routine practice of supplying newspapers <b>with</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> activities at the college.|$|E

5|$|Information {{from the}} sense organs is {{collected}} in the brain. There {{it is used to}} determine what actions the organism is to take. The brain processes the raw data to extract information about the structure of the environment. Next it combines the processed information <b>with</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> the current needs of the animal and with memory of past circumstances. Finally, {{on the basis of the}} results, it generates motor response patterns. These signal-processing tasks require intricate interplay between a variety of functional subsystems.|$|E
5|$|On October 8, 2012, Pixar {{revealed}} a fully functional website for Monsters University, complete <b>with</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> admissions, academic and campus life, and a campus store to purchase MU apparel. On April 1, 2013, the website was styled {{to appear as}} though a rival college, Fear Tech, had hacked and vandalized it. The first television commercial for the film was aired during the 2013 Rose Bowl Game, parodying advertisements for participating schools that are shown during college football telecasts. From June 27 until July 11, 2013, Disney's online game Club Penguin hosted a Monsters University Takeover event to promote the film.

5|$|After {{learning}} of Crix Madine's (a former Imperial Commander Human, who had defected to the Alliance) capture and imminent execution, Kyle proceeds {{to a high}} security detention center on Orinackra to rescue him. Madine provides the Rebel Alliance <b>with</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> the smuggling of Dark Trooper materials, leading Katarn to investigate the Ramsees Hed docking port on Cal-Seti. He then destroys a robotics facility on the icy planet Anteevy, {{the second stage of}} the Dark Trooper production line. After being captured by Jabba the Hutt and having to escape his ship, Katarn infiltrates a computer vault on Coruscant which reveals the location of the Ergo fuel station, the final stage in the smuggling route. He masquerades as a smuggler, gaining access to the Super Star Destroyer Executor, which brings him finally to the Arc Hammer starship, the headquarters of General Mohc's Dark Trooper project, where he successfully destroys the operation and kills Mohc.|$|E
5|$|Caregivers use {{language}} {{to help children}} become competent members of society and culture. From birth, infants receive pragmatic information. They learn structure of conversations from early interactions with caregivers. Actions and speech are organized in games, such as peekaboo to provide children <b>with</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> words and phrases. Caregivers find many ways to help infants interact and respond. As children advance and participate more actively in interactions, caregivers adapt their interactions accordingly. Caregivers also prompt children to produce correct pragmatic behaviours. They provide input about what children are expected to say, how to speak, when they should speak, {{and how they can}} stay on topic. Caregivers may model the appropriate behaviour, using verbal reinforcement, posing a hypothetical situation, addressing children's comments, or evaluating another person.|$|E

5|$|Despite the dissatisfaction {{of the men}} in the SWPA, the {{demobilisation}} and repatriation process generally proceeded smoothly. Most men {{had been}} returned to Australia by January 1946 and 80 percent were demobilised by the middle of the year. Before leaving the military service men and women attended either a dispersal centre or naval depot where they were provided with a medical examination, interviewed by a rehabilitation officer and provided <b>with</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> the benefits they were eligible for. The Manpower Directorate was then responsible for placing discharged personnel in employment as well as providing them with identity documentation and ration entitlements. Training courses were made available to veterans, and by 1951 94,000 had completed university, technical or rural training courses and 39,000 were still in training. A further 135,000 began training but withdrew before completing their course.|$|E
5|$|It is {{difficult}} to pin point any one reason as being the main cause or catalyst of the mutiny. However, a recent perspective has emerged {{of the role of}} global connections. The mutiny has revealed the permeable nature of colonial boundaries and the way that external influences were able to reach the colonies in Southeast Asia. The sepoys of the 5th Light Infantry were constantly being bombarded <b>with</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> what was happening outside of Singapore. As news of the fatwa issued by the Ottoman Sultan spread, an anti-British movement spearheaded by the Ghadar Party was also disseminating special pamphlets in a variety of languages which were reaching through secret channels {{into the hands of the}} sepoys. Acrimonious slogans against the British only fuelled the anti-colonial sentiment among the sepoys. Some of the slogans were “the wicked English and their allies are now attacking Islam, but the German Emperor and the Sultan of Turkey have sworn to liberate Asia from the tyranny. Now is the time to rise.... Only your strength and religious zeal are required”. The sepoys were clearly being bombarded with a lot of anti-British sentiments while being stationed on the small island of Singapore.|$|E
5|$|Lead singer Smith {{revealed}} that the band will explore a new direction on their next album, pursuing a new, rawer sound. Before January 2009, Editors had written around eighteen new songs for the new album {{and they have been}} described as some of the most synthetic, raw and anthemic songs they have written to date. In October the band went to the studio to record some demos. The band spent the first week of April recording the album and on 8 April, they released a short video <b>with</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> the recording process. It announced that Mark 'Flood' Ellis would be the producer for the album. Earlier on in the year, the sound of the album was said to have a very electric feel; the band often using the Terminator theme song as a reference.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, {{there were}} some who were {{concerned}} by the expansion of powers granted to Augustus by the Second Settlement, and this {{came to a head}} with the apparent conspiracy of Fannius Caepio. Some time prior to 1 September 22 BC, a certain Castricius provided Augustus <b>with</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> a conspiracy led by Fannius Caepio. Murena was named among the conspirators, the outspoken Consul who defended Primus in the Marcus Primus Affair. The conspirators were tried in absentia with Tiberius acting as prosecutor; the jury found them guilty, {{but it was not a}} unanimous verdict. All the accused were sentenced to death for treason and executed as soon as they were captured—without ever giving testimony in their defence. Augustus ensured that the facade of Republican government continued with an effective cover-up of the events.|$|E
5|$|On April 27, U.S. ships, {{the monitor}} , the armored cruisers , and the , bombarded the Spanish fortifications at Matanzas Bay in Cuba. By July 16, an {{armistice}} was signed at the Arbol de La Paz (a large ceiba tree) in Santiago de Cuba by U.S. and Spanish forces ending hostilities in Cuba and its waters. The United States then directed its undivided military resources to Puerto Rico. Two {{leaders of the}} Puerto Rican section of the Cuban Revolutionary Party, Dr. Julio J. Henna and Roberto H. Todd, had written to U.S. President McKinley asking that Puerto Rico be included in whatever intervention was planned for Cuba as early as March 10. They even provided the U.S. government <b>with</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> the Spanish military presence on the island.|$|E
5|$|One famous {{site where}} {{historical}} records {{have been used}} to interpret sites is Chichen Itza. Rather than analysing the site and seeing which targets appear popular, archaeoastronomers have instead examined the ethnographic records to see what features of the sky were important to the Mayans and then sought archaeological correlates. One example which could have been overlooked without historical records is the Mayan interest in the planet Venus. This interest is attested to by the Dresden codex which contains tables <b>with</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> the Venus's appearances in the sky. These cycles would have been of astrological and ritual significance as Venus was associated with Quetzalcoatl or Xolotl. Associations of architectural features with settings of Venus can be found in Chichen Itza, Uxmal, and probably some other Mesoamerican sites.|$|E
