You have a right to elect whom you please; vote for the man you think best, and I think, when that is done, that you and I are freemen. Do as you consider right and honest in electing men for office. I did not come here to make you a long speech, although invited to do so by you. I am not much of a speaker, and my business prevented me from preparing myself. I came to meet you as friends, and welcome you to the white people. I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> nearer to us. When I can serve you I will do so. We have but one flag, one country; let us stand together. We may differ in color, but not in sentiment. Use your best judgment in selecting men for office and vote as you think right.|$|E
2500|$|Giuliani {{continued}} {{to maintain that}} his strategy of focusing on later, larger primaries would result in his winning the nomination. Before the New Hampshire votes had been counted, Giuliani's campaign moved to Florida {{in preparation for the}} state's January 29 primary. [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> join us there and help us", he said. [...] "And help us in Connecticut. Help us in New York. Help us in New Jersey." ...|$|E
2500|$|Katherine Helmond as Mrs. Ida Lowry. According to Helmond, Gilliam {{called her}} and said, [...] "I have a part for you, and I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> over and do it, but you're {{not going to}} look very nice in it." [...] The make-up was applied by Gilliam's wife, Maggie. During production, Helmond spent ten hours a day with a mask glued to her face; her scenes had to be {{postponed}} due to the blisters this caused.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back," [...] she acknowledged, {{with her}} {{straight}} {{look into his}} eyes. [...] "I <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back," [...] she repeated, more softly, as if musing.|$|R
5000|$|... "my father <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> tomorrow" [...] (the father’s wanting is real, {{whereas the}} {{anticipated}} coming is still unreal) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{is in the}} dining-room," [...] {{replied the}} child, getting hold of his hand. [...] "She <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> and have coffee with us." ...|$|R
2500|$|The note read [...] "Khartoum all right. Can {{hold out}} for years. C.G. Gordon", but the {{messenger}} (who knew very little English) had memorised another, darker message from Gordon, namely: [...] "We <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> quickly". In the same month, Gordon {{received a letter from}} the Mahdi offering safe passage out of Khartoum: [...] "We have written to you to go back to your country...I repeat to you the words of Allah, Do not destroy yourself. Allah Himself is merciful to you".|$|E
2500|$|In 1952, {{while still}} working for Northcutt Ely, Stevens {{volunteered for the}} presidential {{campaign}} of Dwight D. Eisenhower, writing position papers for the campaign on western water law and lands. By the time Eisenhower won the election that November, Stevens had acquired contacts who told him, [...] "We <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> over to Interior." [...] Stevens left his job with Ely, but {{a job in the}} Eisenhower administration didn't come through {{as a result of a}} temporary hiring freeze instituted by Eisenhower in an effort to reduce spending.|$|E
2500|$|During the June visit, the {{children}} said the lady {{told them to}} say the Holy Rosary daily in honor of Our Lady of the Rosary to obtain peace {{and the end of}} the Great War. (Three weeks earlier, on 21 April, the first contingent of Portuguese soldiers had embarked for the front lines of the war.) The lady also purportedly revealed to {{the children}} a vision of hell, and entrusted a secret to them, described as [...] "good for some and bad for others". Fr. Ferreira later stated that Lúcia recounted that the lady told her, [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back on the thirteenth and to learn to read in order to understand what I want of you. ...I don't want more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know that}} very well; I didn't believe {{a word of}} it. But I <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> into the house; I thought we should be friends." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Or {{rather it}} isn't mine, but papa's. Old Mr. Standish {{is going to}} give up Loughton, and papa <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> and try your luck there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is that Ronnie? Yes, this is Lady Anselman. Your uncle told me <b>to</b> ring <b>you</b> up <b>to</b> see if <b>you</b> were in. He <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> round." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{shut-down}} of the Army facility {{proved the}} last straw for Truman. [...] On the evening of July 23, Truman ordered the steelmakers and the union {{to meet in the}} White House the following day and settle the strike. At 10:00a.m. on July 24, Murray and Fairless were ushered into the Oval Office. Truman informed the two men of top-secret statistics which showed the U.S. war effort in Korea was being crippled. The President then told Fairless: [...] "You can settle this thing, Ben, and you've got to settle it. I want it settled by tomorrow morning, or I will have some things to say that you won't like to hear, and I will have to do some things you won't like." [...] Fairless started in surprise. Truman then turned to Murray and said, [...] "Phil, you've got to settle this thing too. Now go in there in the Cabinet room, and I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out with a settlement." [...] The two men adjourned to the Cabinet Room. At 4:45p.m., Fairless and Murray told the President that they had reached an agreement. Steelman witnessed its signing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Teacher," [...] {{replied the}} Chief Kosa, with {{twitching}} face and rolling eyes, [...] "we <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> {{down to the}} church and pray for us. Our houses are gone, our fields are washed away. We <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to pray for us, for more rain is gathering on the hills and we are afraid." ...|$|E
60|$|ALICE. Just so. Well, I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> {{out with}} us to-night to watch him.|$|E
6000|$|... 'We {{were just}} coming for you, Ned,' Mr. Hawtrey said. 'Singleton <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> and lunch with him. He and I {{want to have}} a talk with you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He ain't brought none but hisself, 'cause he come on horseback; and it's {{my belief}} he's going back almost immediate. But he <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> him, Mrs Dale." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, then, don't go till next day. I <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> {{and stay}} {{a few days}} with us. Here I am, on purpose <b>to</b> bid <b>you,</b> and <b>you</b> fly off <b>to</b> Yarmouth!' ...|$|R
60|$|PHOEBE I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> and {{be photographed}} for the Daily Mirror. The man's waiting downstairs.|$|E
60|$|ALICE. I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> {{with us on}} {{this mysterious}} walk and keep an eye on Lob.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> {{for your}} aunt," [...] said Daisy; [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> for me." [...] And {{this was the}} only allusion that the young man was ever to hear her make to his invidious kinswoman. He {{declared}} that, at any rate, he would certainly come. After this Daisy stopped teasing. Winterbourne took a carriage, and they drove back to Vevey in the dusk; the young girl was very quiet.|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here, Ann Veronica," [...] he began. [...] "I want a plain {{word with}} you about all this. Do <b>you</b> mean <b>to</b> tell me <b>you</b> didn't {{understand}} why I <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite right," [...] Kinsley agreed. [...] "I <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> {{absolutely}} on your own. Let's {{get into}} the coffee-room and have some lunch now. I want to catch the afternoon train hack to town." ...|$|R
6000|$|The boy {{answered}} with the disgust a sister's company manners always rouse in a brother. [...] "Motha <b>wants</b> <b>you.</b> Says she's wo'ked down, and she <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> and help." [...] Then he went his way.|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{probably}} <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> {{down to the}} 'Unusual' to-morrow morning," [...] he said. [...] "Bring any {{new songs}} you may have." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There are American vendettas," [...] {{said the}} priest impassively. Then he added: [...] "They <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> {{to the library}} and see it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No. I was disagreeable too, Pa; we {{were all}} of us disagreeable together. But I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> and dine with me somewhere, Pa.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> my {{home with}} me; but I suppose {{that is too}} much to ask, for of course <b>you</b> intend <b>to</b> be on the street, in order to know what is going on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's quite too ridiculous!" [...] she declared, tossing her head. [...] "I really <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> with me this morning, {{because you}} know the country," [...] she added, with a sidelong glance from her dark eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, darling, darling, and I've {{always told}} you, so carefully, {{that you were}} {{absolutely}} free. I just <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> around when <b>you</b> were tired and {{wanted to talk to}} me, or when you could enjoy our parties--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to M. de Kercadiou with me, and to {{use your}} {{influence}} to obtain justice. I suppose I am asking too much." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The bank's {{steep and}} I sheered her in until I could {{jump from the}} {{bowsprit}} end. I didn't <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> on board without knowing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Our pretty Rose seems sad," [...] said Lady Grenville, {{coming up}} to her. [...] "Cheer up, child! we <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> and sing to us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Windibrook," [...] {{continued}} the reverend gentleman in his highest, heartiest voice, albeit a little hurried, [...] "wished me <b>to</b> say <b>to</b> <b>you</b> that until you heard from--your friends--she <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> {{and stay with}} her. DO come! DO!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is {{very kind}} of you, Mr. Grey," [...] said the squire, {{speaking}} in a cheery voice. [...] "I <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> very much, but I hardly thought that you would take the trouble. Augustus is here, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{immediate}} {{result of}} this was that Lady Tringle herself did drive across to Kingsbury Crescent accompanied by Gertrude and Lucy, and did make her request in form. [...] "My dear, your uncle particularly <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> us for the next month." [...] Mrs. Dosett was sitting by. [...] "I hope Ayala may be allowed <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> us for a month." ...|$|R
