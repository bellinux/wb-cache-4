5|$|Fire {{is another}} {{important}} element in {{the maintenance of the}} Everglades. The majority are caused by lightning strikes from thunderstorms during the wet season. Their effects are largely superficial, and serve to foster further plant growth: sawgrass will burn above water, but the roots are preserved. Fire in the sawgrass marshes serves to keep out larger bushes and trees, and releases nutrients from decaying plant matter more efficiently than decomposition. Large burned areas also affect <b>waterflow,</b> since wind and water are undeterred by the eradicated sawgrass; water may flow two to three times faster in recently burned areas. During the wet season only dead plant matter and the tips of plants are burned; however, the effects of fire are much more significant in the dry season, as fire may be fed by organic peat and burn deeply, destroying root systems. The only impediment to the spread of fire in the Everglades is the presence of water. It takes around 225years for one foot (0.3m) of peat to develop, but the peat is not as dense as it should be for the 5,000years of the Everglades' existence. Scientists point to fire as the reason.|$|E

25|$|This Wisconsin {{glaciation}} left widespread {{impacts on}} the North American landscape. The Great Lakes and the Finger Lakes were carved by ice deepening old valleys. Most of the lakes in Minnesota and Wisconsin were gouged out by glaciers and later filled with glacial meltwaters.

[...] The Municipal art League exhibition Chairperson, Mrs. William F. Grower, decided to form a subcommittee to help satisfy public support for the work to be the first Ferguson fund commission. However, even after the probate court released the bequest to the trustees on May 23, 1906, no commission was made because the trustees were undecided between a statuary and a portrait commission.|$|E

Washington also built a house for the miller and a cooperage to supply barrels for the mill, and later, the distillery operation. [...] The mill was powered by a large water wheel.

The backpressurealgorithm operates in slotted time. Every time slot it seeks to route data in directions thatmaximize the differential backlog between neighboring nodes. This is similar to how <b>waterflows</b> through a network of pipes via pressure gradients. However, the backpressure algorithmcan be applied to multi-commodity networks (where different packets may have different destinations),and to networks where transmission rates can be selectedfrom a set of (possibly time-varying) options. Attractive featuresof the backpressure algorithm are: (i) it leads to maximum network throughput, (ii)it is provably robust to time-varying network conditions, (iii) itcan be implemented without knowing traffic arrival rates or channel stateprobabilities. However, the algorithm may introduce large delays, and maybe difficult to implement exactly in networks with interference. Modifications ofbackpressure that reduce delay and simplify implementation are described belowunder Improving delay and Distributed backpressure.|$|R
2500|$|Wednesday 19 February 2014 late in {{the evening}} a leakage was found near a storage tank with {{radioactive}} water. The water contained 230.000.000 bq/l. The water did flow over the barrier around the tank, into the grounds around it. TEPCO estimated that some 100 metric tons were lost. [...] After the <b>waterflow</b> into the tank was cut off, the leakage stopped, According to TEPCO nothing was flown into the ocean nearby. Further investigations were done after the cause of the leakage. A valve was opened by error, this caused an inflow of water to the tank. Around 2 p.m. on 19 Feb. an alarm went off, indicating that the tank was dangerously filled. This alarm was ignored, because no radioactive water was transferred to the tank. The tank, however, got overfilled, and the radioactive access water left the tank along the rain-gutter. Because all rainwater is directed outside the barriers around the tanks, the overflowing radioactive water seeped directly into the grounds. According to TEPCO all leakage was due to human error. The patrols were doubled to twice a day, and the number of workers involved was increased 6 times to 60 people. Because the leak was about 700 meters from the coastal line, TEPCO did believe that none of this water had reached the ocean.|$|E

The flow pathways were identified by artificial tracer experiments. We evaluated how well hydrometric calculations based on tensiometry and permeametry measurements predicted the tracer patterns. The tracer work indicated much faster subsurface flows at Bukit Timah than W 8 S 5 for the storms studied. Some explanation of the greater subsurface <b>waterflows</b> at Bukit Timah in comparison to W 8 S 5 is afforded by the less steep moisture release curves which maintain hydraulic conductivity as the soil dries.

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{representation}} of hydrological land surface processes, which {{has so far been}} treated inadequately in global models of the atmospheric general circulation (GCMs), a model for the lateral <b>waterflows</b> from the continents into the ocean on the global scale was developed.

Here, global scale refers to the resolution of 0. 5 and lower, corresponding to a typical GCM gridbox area of about 2500 km" 2. This model is called the Hydrological Discharge model or HD model. The HD model computes the discharge only at 0. 5 resolution. A model input fields (runoff and drainage, see Sect. 3. 1.) from the various GCM resolutions are interpolated to the same 0. 5 grid. Thus, input fields may be used from any available resolution, if the corresponding interpolation routine to the 0. 5 degree grid is provided. Since the HD model uses a time step of one day, a temporal resolution of one day is sufficient for the input fields. (orig.)
