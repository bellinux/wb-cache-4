Bush's approval rating went below the 50% mark in AP-Ipsos polling in December 2004. Thereafter, his approval ratings and approval of his handling of domestic and foreign policy issues steadily dropped. Bush received heavy criticism for his handling of the Iraq War, his response to Hurricane Katrina and to the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse, NSA warrantless surveillance, the Plame affair, and Guantanamo Bay detention camp controversies.

2500|$|George H. W. Bush {{employed}} the word [...] "liberal" [...] as a derogatory epithet during his 1988 presidential campaign.

He referred to liberalism as [...] "the L-word" [...] and sought to demonize opposing presidential candidate Michael Dukakis by labeling Dukakis [...] "the liberal governor" [...] and by pigeonholing him as part of <b>what</b> <b>Bush</b> called [...] "the L-crowd". Bush recognized that motivating voters to fear Dukakis as a risky, non-mainstream candidate generated political support for his own campaign. Bush's campaign also used issues of prayer to arouse suspicions that Dukakis was less devout in his religious convictions. Bush's running mate, vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle said to Christians at the 1988 Republican National Convention [...] "It's always good to be with people who are real Americans". Bill Clinton avoided association with [...] "liberal" [...] as a political label during his 1992 presidential campaign against George H.W. Bush by moving closer to the political center.|$|E

40|$|Less {{than two}} months after 11 September 2001, and {{a few weeks after}} the {{beginning}} of the US bombing campaign in Afghanistan, President George W. Bush made an urgent plea to see Iranian filmmaker Mohsen Makhmalbaf's Kandahar. Not only did the President want to see Kandahar; he encouraged US citizens to view it as well. This article offers two readings of Kandahar - the first suggestive of what its filmmaker Makhmalbaf saw in Afghanistan and the second suggestive of <b>what</b> <b>Bush</b> saw (or hoped to see) in Makhmalbaf's Afghanistan. In particular, this article focuses on how the Bush administration - against the intentions of Kandahar's director and star - propelled occidental subjects to 'lift the veil' on Afghanistan and on Afghan women by viewing Kandahar as if it positioned the feminine as a needy and willing object of US rescue. It was in part by laying this particular claim to the separated sisters of Kandahar that the Bush administration constructed a humanitarian US 'we' as among the foundations of its 'moral grammar of war' in the war on terror...|$|E
