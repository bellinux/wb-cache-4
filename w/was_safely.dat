5|$|In the semifinal, three skaters, {{including}} the defending champion, crashed {{into each other}} and Bradbury moved up into second place {{to qualify for the}} final. In the final, Bradbury was substantially slower than his opponents and <b>was</b> <b>safely</b> in last place, around 15m behind with only 50m to go, when all four rivals collided and fell over, allowing him to avoid the pile-up and take the victory. The unlikely win turned Bradbury into something of a folk hero across Australia and around the world.|$|E
5|$|Initiating the {{explosive}} egress system called for pushing, or hitting, a metal trigger with the hand, {{which would have}} left an unavoidably large obvious bruise, but Grissom was found {{not to have any}} of the telltale hand bruising. Still, controversy remained, and fellow Mercury astronaut Wally Schirra, {{at the end of his}} October 3, 1962, flight, remained inside his spacecraft until it <b>was</b> <b>safely</b> aboard the recovery ship, and made a point of deliberately blowing the hatch to get out, bruising his hand.|$|E
5|$|When {{the last}} besieged {{garrison}} (aside from Kailahun) was evacuated on 30 May, preparations {{for a military}} extraction—should Jetley's negotiations fail—began to increase. The operation (codenamed Operation Khukri) was eventually launched on 10 July. Two RAF Chinooks transported Indian special forces {{to the outskirts of}} Kailahun. The helicopters returned to Freetown with Harrison, his fellow UNMOs, and several Gurkhas who had been wounded during the siege. Harrison <b>was</b> <b>safely</b> extracted and the 600 Gurkhas successfully fought their way out of Kailahun, suffering one casualty in the process.|$|E

5|$|Both ships saw {{extensive}} {{service with}} the German Navy; Prinz Adalbert {{was used as}} a gunnery training ship for her entire peacetime career, while Friedrich Carl served with the fleet until 1909, when she was withdrawn to act as a torpedo training vessel. At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, both vessels were mobilized and assigned to the cruiser squadron in the Baltic. Friedrich Carl was sunk by Russian naval mines off Memel in November 1914, though most of her crew <b>was</b> <b>safely</b> evacuated. Prinz Adalbert was torpedoed twice by British submarines operating in the Baltic; the first, on 1 July 1915, caused serious damage that was ultimately repaired. The second, on 23 October 1915, caused a catastrophic explosion in the ship's ammunition magazines that destroyed the vessel. Six hundred and seventy-two men were killed, the greatest single loss of life for the German Navy in the Baltic during the war.|$|E
5|$|During this period, neither William nor Robert {{seems to}} have trusted Henry. Waiting until the {{rebellion}} against William Rufus <b>was</b> <b>safely</b> over, Henry returned to England in July 1088. He met with the King {{but was unable to}} persuade him to grant him their mother's estates, and travelled back to Normandy in the autumn. While he had been away, however, Odo, the Bishop of Bayeux, who regarded Henry as a potential competitor, had convinced Robert that Henry was conspiring against the duke with William Rufus. On landing, Odo seized Henry and imprisoned him in Neuilly-la-Forêt, and Robert took back the county of the Cotentin. Henry was held there over the winter, but in the spring of 1089 the senior elements of the Normandy nobility prevailed upon Robert to release him.|$|E
5|$|Following the crew's post-sleep activities, {{they went}} to work {{performing}} the rendezvous operations that included burning the orbiter's engines to refine the approach to the Hubble telescope. Following some delays due to communications issues, Altman and Johnson ("Ray-J") guided the orbiter within fifty feet of the telescope. McArthur successfully grappled Hubble at 17:14 UTC, and at 18:12 the telescope <b>was</b> <b>safely</b> berthed in the payload bay of Atlantis. Later in the day, Grunsfeld and Feustel (Drew), along with Good ("Bueno") and Massimino ("Mass") worked on preparing for the next day's spacewalk, gathering tools and checking out the suits and equipment {{that would be used}} during the EVA.|$|E

5|$|Later that month, Breckinridge {{served as}} an {{independent}} commander in the lower Mississippi Valley, securing Confederate control of the area by taking Port Hudson, which helped halt the federal advance down the Mississippi River. Meanwhile, General Braxton Bragg, commanding the Army of Mississippi, was preparing an invasion of Kentucky, and Breckinridge was ordered to join him. Confederate leaders believed that Breckinridge's presence in the state could spur enlistments. Van Dorn was reluctant to lose command of Breckinridge and his men, {{and by the time}} he relented on October 15, Bragg was already retreating from the state after being defeated at the Battle of Perryville. Breckinridge and his division of 7,000 men met Bragg at Murfreesboro, Tennessee. With Kentucky solidly under Union control, Breckinridge's wife and children moved south and followed his troops as closely as <b>was</b> <b>safely</b> possible.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{objective}} of the Japanese at Kranji was to capture Kranji village; this would let them repair the demolished Causeway {{in order to facilitate}} easy flow of reinforcements and supplies down the roads of Woodlands and Mandai, and {{to the rest of the}} island for their vanguard force. Once the leading wave of Japanese <b>was</b> <b>safely</b> ashore, the massed Japanese artillery switched their fire to the defensive positions at Kranji. Telegraph and telephone communications were destroyed in the bombardment and communications between the front line and command HQ were broken. At 8:30pm that night, the men of the Imperial Guards Division began the crossing from Johor in special armoured landing-crafts, collapsible boats and by swimming.|$|E
5|$|Howe {{realised}} {{that the}} direction of Villaret's departure would take him directly across Admiral Montagu's planned route, and that, should Montagu meet Villaret, the British squadron would be destroyed. Setting all sail in pursuit, Howe followed Villaret into the Atlantic on 20 May. The next day Howe's ships recaptured ten of the lost Dutch merchantmen, but {{he was forced to}} burn them since crewing them with British sailors would weaken his own already understrength fleet. Prisoners from these ships gave Howe the information that the French fleet was only a short distance ahead, but that it had been joined by an additional ship from Nielly's squadron as well as several frigates. By now satisfied that Montagu <b>was</b> <b>safely</b> to the southwest, Howe pressed on hoped to bring Villaret to battle within the week. On 23 May however, the British fleet was driven southwards by strong winds and had to slowly work its way north to find the French track again. The detour did however enable him to recapture and destroy four more of Villaret's Dutch prizes.|$|E

5|$|Vietnamese {{president}} Trần Đức Lương {{expressed his}} {{thanks to the}} Chinese government on May 22 for rescuing the Vietnamese on the imperiled ships. Residents and industries in Vietnam raised ₫360million (VND, $36,000USD) {{for the families of}} the deceased fishermen, as well as providing 1ton of rice. Trade unions encouraged workers to donate one day's salary to help storm victims. The Vietnamese embassy in India raised about $1,000 (USD) and Vietnamese people living in Greece raised ₫26million (VND, €1,300 Euros) for storm victims. Ultimately, 43 different organizations and people donated $29,000 (USD) to the Vietnam Red Cross. The country's Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs presented an award to the Vietnam News Agency in June 2006 for its charitable donations, which included the distribution of ₫112million (VND, $11,200USD) to storm victims. One fisherman claimed to survive for two weeks in the open seas before being rescued, although he later confessed that he <b>was</b> <b>safely</b> on another boat, and wanted his family to retain the disaster compensation; after the man revealed that he had lied, his family was able to retain the relief funds due to their poverty. The head of the Vietnam Institute of Meteorology, Hydrology and Environment resigned two weeks after Chanchu killed many fishermen because of inadequate warnings. Then-Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung ordered a review of the meteorological agency as a result. Within a few years after the typhoon, the meteorological agency began issuing more accurate and timely forecasts. After the many deaths of fishermen from Chanchu, the Vietnam government prevented any fishermen from leaving harbor during the passage of Typhoon Durian in November.|$|E

25|$|The Confederate brigades {{withdrew from}} north to south. Once Chambliss, Rosser, and Wickham had departed, Rutledge and the 20th Georgia Battalion were uncovered.
