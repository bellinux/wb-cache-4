She tells Laura, somewhat evasively, that the problem is in her uterus, probably the cause of her infertility. Laura moves to comfort Kitty with an embrace. She feels a sense of what it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a man, and also a sort of jealousy towards Ray, Kitty's husband. Both women capitulate to the moment, to holding each other. Laura is kissing Kitty's forehead, when Kitty lifts her face and {{the two women}} kiss each other on the lips.|$|E
500|$|According to Metcalfe, Mercedes did {{not want}} to have an affair and was not [...] "looking for someone else", stating, [...] "Malachy's been working hard to provide for them and he hasn’t {{had a lot of time}} for her". Turning to Calvin, she confided in him and they kiss. Whittle added that the affair had become more serious and their {{chemistry}} was [...] "more than just physical". Also according to Metcalfe, [...] "Every three months Mercedes has to have an HIV test and, yes, it is making her resent Malachy a bit. She can’t help wondering what it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> with someone like Calvin who isn't HIV positive", even though she felt [...] "guilty". When Mercedes learned that she has to be retested for HIV, she feared that the test would be positive. Initially, she did not tell Malachy about it, but eventually [...] "snaps" [...] at him, telling him she [...] "won't forgive him" [...] if she has contracted HIV. The test was negative which was a [...] "huge relief" [...] for them.|$|E
500|$|Director Nate Fox {{stated that}} much of the {{inspiration}} of the superhero story came from two DC Comics series, DMZ and [...] Both center on a city after a large disaster. The series also inspired the crafting of the game's grim take on the superhero genre. Fox further stated that the film Batman Begins was an inspiration for the game. However, any correlation to DC Comics' Static Shock was unintentional. Fox considered his own personal involvement in the Seattle WTO riots of 1999 as influencing the reflection of [...] "spending time in a lawless place" [...] within the game. Grand Theft Auto III was also stated as an influence, in that the team could easily see themselves as superheroes in the open world of Liberty City; similarly, Spider-Man 2 was used as a model to demonstrate {{what it would be like}} to move about the city and answer random requests for help alongside regular missions. They had toyed around with a version of the game that they compared to a superhero version of Animal Crossing, and along side superhero work, the hero would have an alter-ego of property developer to meet the citizens' more common needs, but dropped this and focused solely on superhero activities after about six months of work. The character of Cole was created to be a [...] "kind of an everyman" [...] so that players could then [...] "get into the headspace of what it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a real human being who has been granted these exceptional abilities". The team also avoided giving Cole an alter-ego or outfitting him with a costume as it would not have reasonably fit in with the character or the game's story.|$|E

How to Be Both is unforgettable. I can never know what it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> meet George before knowing Del Cossa, so that version of the novel is forever lost to me. It's a bit sad. But it was worth it." ...|$|R
2500|$|In August 2008, Thile and bassist Edgar Meyer {{announced}} the release {{date of the}} duo's planned debut album. The album was released on Thile's label Nonesuch Records on September 23, 2008. Commenting on the collaboration, Thile said [...] "Edgar {{is one of the}} biggest influences on my musical life, and now I'm in a duo with him and writing songs with him. This was my dream. I always wondered what it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> playing music this hard." [...] The duo toured in September and October 2008 to promote the album.|$|E
2500|$|The album {{incorporates}} the band's political beliefs; Hanna commented {{that she wanted}} [...] "to make something that's totally pleasurable and political too." [...] "My My Metrocard" [...] criticizes New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, and [...] "Hot Topic" [...] praises progressive activists. The band emphasized frankness and didacticism in its lyrics {{as a response to}} the ironic tone of hipster subculture. Le Tigre's vocals often carry a bored or soft-spoken tone, punctuated by more energetic bursts. Their use of girl group chants was likened to 1960s group the Shangri-Las. Hanna was influenced by the vocals on old records by Lesley Gore, the Shirelles, and Connie Francis. She explained that she was fascinated by [...] "what it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a woman with way more constraints than we have now, singing these really fucked-up insipid heterosexual love songs." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before {{getting the}} job of director, Watts created images of Nick Fury as Parker's mentor in the story in early [...] "mood reels" [...] saying, [...] "I don’t know what the {{situation}} would be, {{but that would be}} a person he’d want to get in trouble with." [...] Feige said the films of John Hughes would be a major influence and that Parker's personal growth and development would be just as important as his role as Spider-Man. He noted that [...] "at that age, in high school, everything feels like life or death." [...] He also said that the film hoped to use one of Spider-Man's rogues that have not been seen in film yet, and that filming would begin in June 2016. In July 2015, it was reported that Marisa Tomei had been offered the role of May Parker, Peter's aunt. It was also revealed that Daley and Goldstein, after missing out on the director role, had begun negotiations to write the screenplay, and were given three days to present Marvel with their pitch; both confirmed shortly after that they had reached a deal to write the screenplay. The pair had proposed a take on the character that was [...] "diametrically opposed" [...] to the previous Spider-Man films, creating a [...] of all the elements seen in those films and actively trying to avoid re-using them in this film. They chose to focus on the high school aspects of the character and [...] "what it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a real kid who gets superpowers", rather than the [...] "drama and weight of the tragedy that leads to the origin of Spider-Man". They felt this would differentiate him from the other MCU superheroes as well. Daley called the film [...] "an origin story of him finding his place in the Marvel [...] Universe", with the writing team wanting the film to [...] "focus on [...] coming to terms with his new abilities and not yet being good with them, and carrying with him some real human fears and weaknesses," [...] such as a fear of heights when he has to scale the Washington Monument. Daley noted, [...] "Even within the context of this movie, I don't think you would feel that fear of heights or even the vertigo the audience feels in that scene if you establish him as swinging from skyscrapers {{at the top of the}} movie." [...] The writers also wanted to avoid the skyscrapers of Manhattan because of how often they were used in the other films, and instead wrote the character into locations such as [...] "the suburbs, on a golf course, the Staten Island Ferry, Coney Island, and even Washington D.C." [...] One of the first sequences they pitched was [...] "seeing Spider-Man attached to a plane 10,000 feet up in the air, where he had absolutely no safety net. If you have a character that you’re so familiar with, and you’re familiar with the sort of areas he’s been in, why not turn it on its head and make it something different that people haven’t seen before?" [...] The pair conceded that the film took a more grounded, [...] "low-stakes" [...] approach than previous films, in part to Spider-Man existing in a world with the Avengers, since [...] "if the threat became world-threatening, you would obviously bring in the big guys to handle it." ...|$|E

6000|$|Felix and Peter and I were {{required}} to help Uncle Roger in some carpentering work that day, and Felicity indulged {{in one of the}} house-cleaning orgies so dear to her soul; so that it was evening before we were all free to meet in the orchard and loll on the grasses of Uncle Stephen's Walk. In August it was a place of shady sweetness, fragrant with the odour of ripening apples, full of dear, delicate shadows. Through its openings we looked afar to the blue rims of the hills and over green, old, tranquil fields, lying the sunset glow. Overhead the lacing leaves made a green, murmurous roof. There {{was no such thing as}} hurry in the world, while we lingered there and talked of [...] "cabbages and kings." [...] A tale of the Story Girl's, wherein princes were thicker than blackberries, and queens as common as buttercups, led to our discussion of kings. We wondered what it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a king. Peter thought it would be fine, only kind of inconvenient, wearing a crown all the time.|$|E

'Tis not everyone that cares for his home--there's lots o' them never wants to see their wives again. But for me 'tis like being shut up in a cage, it is!" [...] Mr. Bosengate saw daylight between the skinny fingers of the man's hand thrown out with a jerk. [...] "I cannot bear it shut up away from wife and home like what {{you are in the}} army. So when I took my razor that morning I was wild--an' I wouldn't be here now but for that man catching my hand. There was no reason in it, I'm willing to confess. It was foolish; but wait till you get feeling like what I was, and see how it draws you. Misters the jury, don't send me back to prison; it is worse still there. If you have wives you will know what it is like for lots of us; only some is more nervous than others. I swear to you, sirs, I could not help it---?" [...] Again the little man flung out his hand, his whole thin body shook and Mr. Bosengate felt the same sensation as when he drove his car over a dog--"Misters the jury, I hope you may never in your lives feel as I've been feeling." ...|$|E
