2500|$|One {{of the two}} quotes {{appearing}} on the Stone of Hope and attributed to King, [...] "I was a drum major for justice, peace and righteousness", is a paraphrased version of King's actual words, which were: [...] "If you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was a drum major, say that I was a drum major for justice. Say that I was a drum major for peace. I was a drum major for righteousness. And {{all of the other}} shallow things will not matter." [...] The Washington Posts Rachel Manteuffel noticed the change and publicized it in an August 25, 2011 column, arguing that the revised quote misrepresented both King himself and the meaning of the 1968 sermon from which it was taken, in which King imagined the sort of eulogy he might receive.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the fourteen quotations on the Inscription Wall, {{each side of the}} Stone of Hope includes an additional statement attributed to King. The first, from the [...] "I Have a Dream" [...] speech, is [...] "Out of the Mountain of Despair, a Stone of Hope"—the quotation that serves {{as the basis for the}} monument's design. The words on the other side of the stone used to read, [...] "I Was a Drum Major for Justice, Peace, and Righteousness", which is a paraphrased version of a longer quote by King: [...] "If you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was a drum major, say that I was a drum major for justice. Say that I was a drum major for peace. I was a drum major for righteousness. And all of the other shallow things will not matter." [...] The memorial's use of the paraphrased version of the quote was criticized, and was removed in August 2013.|$|E

Yes, I kind of make out withal that through our insistence an increasing purpose runs, and that one's vision of its final effect (though only {{with the aid of}} time) grows less and less dim, so that one seems to find at moments it's almost sharp! And meanwhile what a purely suicidal record for themselves the business of yesterday--the women and children (and babes in arms) slaughtered at Scarborough and Whitby, with their turning and fleeing as soon as ever they had killed enough for the moment. Oh, I do [...] "think" [...] enough to believe in retribution for that. So I've kind of answered you.|$|E

5000|$|Martin Luther King, Jr. {{often used}} the phrase [...] "drum major {{instinct}}," [...] meaning the instinct to be a leader.
