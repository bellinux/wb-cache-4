5|$|Both NEC tracks have {{high-level}} platforms, {{which were}} added in 2001 {{for use by}} Acela Express trains (which cannot use low platforms). The southbound NEC track is served by a low platform behind the station, <b>which</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> short high-level platform south of State Street. The northbound NEC track is served by a high-level platform behind the station building; the low platform south of State Street is generally only used for deboarding passengers from busy trains. Because of the sharp curve, the high-level platforms are set slightly back from the tracks to avoid scraping the ends of train cars, and thus bridge plates are needed to span the gap between platform and car.|$|E
5|$|If a {{white dwarf}} were {{to exceed the}} Chandrasekhar limit, and nuclear {{reactions}} did not take place, the pressure exerted by electrons {{would no longer be}} able to balance the force of gravity, and it would collapse into a denser object called a neutron star. Carbon-oxygen white dwarfs accreting mass from a neighboring star undergo a runaway nuclear fusion reaction, <b>which</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Type Ia supernova explosion in which the white dwarf may be destroyed, before it reaches the limiting mass.|$|E
5|$|Before he {{can leave}} the capital, Littlefinger offers to take Ned to the last person Jon Arryn spoke to before his death. It {{turns out to be}} a prostitute, Mhaegan, the mother of a baby daughter, who is another of Robert's illegitimate children. Littlefinger reveals Jon Arryn had been searching for Robert's bastards for an unknown reason. When Ned and his guards try to leave, they are ambushed by Jaime Lannister and his men, who want answers for Tyrion's arrest. Ned claims {{responsibility}} for Tyrion's arrest, <b>which</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> brutal fight between his and Jaime's men. In the end, Ned's guards are killed, including his captain Jory Cassel, whom Jaime stabs through the eye with a dagger. Ned duels with Jaime but is speared through the leg by one of Jaime's guards before Stark and Lannister can finish the fight on their own. Jaime knocks out the guard who interrupted the fight and decides to let Ned live but warns that he wants his brother back. Jaime storms away, leaving Ned bleeding in the dirt, where he quickly faints.|$|E

Amanda and Daniel find a tunnel in the safe room <b>which</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> dilapidated bathroom with two rotting corpses. Daniel collapses inside just before Xavier finds them. Amanda notes that he can't read his own number, and he cuts the skin from his neck. As he approaches, Daniel, who feigned his collapse, jumps up and slashes his neck with a hacksaw, killing him.|$|E
5|$|MD363 {{begins at}} a dead end in the {{community}} of Wenona {{at the southern end of}} Deal Island. The state highway heads north, sharply curving before crossing Middle Creek. The road runs through another series of sharp curves through marshland before straightening out and passing St. John's Methodist Episcopal Church and the old post office building, two examples of buildings on the island preserved as part of the Deal Island Historic District. The route passes a boat ramp accessed from Ralph Abbott Road before a high-level bridge carries it over Upper Thorofare, a strait between Laws Cove and Tangier Sound. On the north side of the bridge, MD363 intersects MD363A, the northern approach to the previous bridge to Deal Island, before passing through the community of Chance, the site of Rock Creek Methodist Episcopal Church. After passing Haines Point Road, <b>which</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> large public boat ramp, the state highway continues northeast across the two branches of Rock Creek and through more marshland before entering Dames Quarter. MD363 traverses Dames Quarter Creek and passes through Deal Island Wildlife Management Area.|$|E
5|$|RE11 {{begins at}} an {{at-grade}} intersection with FM 1929, {{to the north}} of a small farm. The roadway proceeds as a two-lane, paved road, traveling northward through rural areas on a large peninsula on the lake. The road continues north, traveling through scrub land before it intersects the Ray Stoker Jr. Highway, and bends slightly northeast for a short distance. After continuing north, the roadway bends northeast, as it intersects the former route of RM 2134. The highway intersects a small road leading to a residential community on the lake, before continuing northeast, where it intersects County Road 4763 (CR 4763), <b>which</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> small residential area. It turns north and continues for a short distance, after which the highway bends northwest, and proceeds to its northern terminus, a boat-launch ramp on the coast of the lake. The highway is maintained by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). No portion of the highway is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E

5|$|The book {{opens with}} Harry seeing Frank Bryce {{being killed by}} Lord Voldemort in a vision, and is awoken by his scar hurting. The Weasleys then take Harry and Hermione Granger to the Quidditch World Cup, using a Portkey, to watch Ireland versus Bulgaria, with Ireland {{emerging}} victorious. There, Harry meets Cedric Diggory, who is attending the match with his father. After the match, Voldemort's followers attack the site, destroying spectators' tents and wreaking havoc. The Dark Mark gets fired into the sky, <b>which</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> panic {{since it is the}} first time the sign has been seen in 13 years. Winky, Barty Crouch Senior's house elf, is falsely accused of casting the Mark after she is found holding Harry's wand, which is revealed to have been used to cast the Mark, as Harry had lost it during the chaos of the Death Eaters' attack. Hermione, angry at this injustice, forms a society to promote the rights of house elves known as S.P.E.W. (Society for the Promotion of Elvish Welfare).|$|E
5|$|The introduction's {{keyboard}} fantasia gradually {{opens the}} band's languid, expansive interplay. The song's groove is established {{with the introduction}} of a bass guitar ostinato at 4:50. Rhythm and tenor guitars and a horn section are played in the next two minutes. During the bridge, Allen's drumming intensifies within the song's seven-minute mark, <b>which</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> fully developed Afrobeat section; Afrobeat is a type of loose funk music embellished with African syncopation, R-styled horn instrumentation, and improvisatory solos. Confusions extended mid-tempo section has complex arrangements of danceable grooves, multiple solos, and Allen's polyrhythms. In this section, Kuti plays tenor saxophone, which he had learned after the 's original tenor player, Igo Chico, left in 1973. The music is complemented by his outspoken call-and-response vocal passages. The song's final 10 minutes comprise raucous trumpet, tenor saxophone solos, and Kuti's lead vocals. Its closing section revisits the abstract interplay of the introduction.|$|E

There, other dancers are {{dancing to the}} song in midway of white rays of light, until the camera shows Jackson {{in the corner of}} the room and they start {{performing}} a dance routine. While the singer disappears from vision, people dance until she appears again dancing to the song. Then she goes to a hallway and enters a red-lighted room, accompanied by dancers, where entertainer Mimi Marks is seen. There she dances another routine along with her dancers. After dancing, she enters in another hallway where she gets alone with a man, until they share a kiss. Then, people who were in the previous room enter to the hallway to connect to another room, with Marks taking Jackson with her. The video ends with people coming closer to Jackson.|$|E

5|$|Urinary tract {{infections are}} more {{concerning}} in pregnancy {{due to the}} increased risk of kidney infections. During pregnancy, high progesterone levels elevate the risk of decreased muscle tone of the ureters and bladder, <b>which</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> greater likelihood of reflux, where urine flows back up the ureters and towards the kidneys. While pregnant women {{do not have an}} increased risk of asymptomatic bacteriuria, if bacteriuria is present they do have a 25–40% risk of a kidney infection. Thus if urine testing shows signs of an infection—even in the absence of symptoms—treatment is recommended. Cephalexin or nitrofurantoin are typically used because they are generally considered safe in pregnancy. A kidney infection during pregnancy may result in premature birth or pre-eclampsia (a state of high blood pressure and kidney dysfunction during pregnancy that can lead to seizures). Some women have UTIs that keep coming back in pregnancy and currently there is not enough research on how to best treat these infections.|$|E
