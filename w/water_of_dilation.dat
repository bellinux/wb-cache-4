Insects may cast {{prominent}} {{shadows on}} the ground, which tend to confuse the tracking algorithm and cause it to jump {{back and forth between}} the insect and its shadow, producing artifacts in the recorded trajectory.

We employ a series <b>of</b> <b>dilation</b> and erosion operations to eliminate the insect’s shadow and/or merge it with its body [24, 25]. Eroding the image results in the elimination of smaller shadows, while dilation causes the insect and its shadow to merge into a single blob.

At effective cell pressures of 100 kPa and below, the stress ratio at the start <b>of</b> <b>dilation</b> is close to the maximum during subsequent dilation and much greater than at the critical state. At higher cell pressures, the material behaves more conventionally in that the maximum stress ratios are more clearly linked to maximum rates <b>of</b> <b>dilation.</b> The role and significance <b>of</b> <b>dilation</b> in a locked sand are discussed with reference to the development of strain localisations into shear planes, thin sections from samples subjected to differeing degrees of shear, and tests on unstructured sands...|$|R

Therefore disappearance of dysphagia or dyspnoea after dilation may be only temporary and repeated dilations are necessary. The objective was to modify technique <b>of</b> balloon <b>dilation</b> for treatment <b>of</b> laryngeal strictures, to estimate what is the influence <b>of</b> <b>dilations</b> on treatment <b>of</b> esophageal and laryngeal strictures, what is appropriate time for evaluation of success rate <b>of</b> esophageal <b>dilations,</b> what is success rate of esophageal and laryngeal dilations one year after last dilation, which factors are decisive for success rate <b>of</b> laryngeal balloon <b>dilations</b> and what is success rate <b>of</b> balloon <b>dilation</b> according to etiology of esophageal strictures. Technique used in balloon <b>dilation</b> <b>of</b> esophageal strictures was successfully modified for <b>dilations</b> <b>of</b> laryngeal strictures. This technique could be used even in apnoea when tracheostomy is absent. Dilations have great influence on success rate of treatment of esophageal strictures, their influence on success rate of treatment of laryngeal strictures is weaker. One year after last dilation is sufficient for evaluation of success rate <b>of</b> <b>dilations.</b> Six month after dilation allowed to estimate which strictures have or have not to undergo surgery. Time of duration of laryngeal stricture before dilation is decisive for success rate <b>of</b> the <b>dilations.</b> Etiology and localization of laryngeal stricture are not so important for success <b>of</b> <b>dilations.</b> Balloon dilation are successful in patient with stricture after surgery repair of esophageal atresia, stricture after fundoplication, stricture due to GER and congenital stenosis. Achalasia is nt indication for dilation. We recommend to attempt dilation, followed by surgery in the case of failure for patient with corrosive stricture.

40|$|In the {{original}} derivation due to Dougall (1897), the center <b>of</b> <b>dilation</b> is constructed from the superposition of orthogonal force dipoles. However, {{it can also}} be built by combining dislocation dipoles. While the two representations are equivalent in elasticity, the different nature of the force and dislocation dipoles leads to different transient behaviors in poroelasticity, when the response evolves from undrained to drained. Indeed, we show that the poroelastic solution of a center <b>of</b> <b>dilation</b> is obtained by superposing the corresponding elastic solution and either an instantaneous fluid sink or an instantaneous fluid source, depending on whether the center <b>of</b> <b>dilation</b> is treated as a singular stress or displacement discontinuity. A simple explanation to the instantaneous injection or withdrawal of a finite volume of fluid from/to the singularity is given by adopting an exploded view of the poroelastic center <b>of</b> <b>dilation.</b> The exploration <b>of</b> the drained, undrained and transient responses of this singularity also requires to clarify the close relationship between an instantaneous fluid source and a continuous fluid dodecapole, an object constructed by collapsing onto a point three orthogonal pairs of fluid dipoles.

40|$|Dilation {{occurs when}} an {{interval}} probability estimate of some event E is properly {{included in the}} interval probability estimate of E conditional on every event F of some partition, which means that one’s initial estimate of E becomes less precise no matter how an experiment turns out. Critics maintain that dilation is a pathological feature of imprecise probability models, while others have thought the problem is with Bayesian updating. However, two points are often overlooked: (1) knowing that E is stochastically independent of F (for all F in a partition of the underlying state space) is sufficient to avoid dilation, but (2) stochastic independence {{is not the only}} independence concept at play within imprecise probability models. In this paper we give a simple characterization <b>of</b> <b>dilation</b> formulated in terms of deviation from stochastic independence, propose a measure <b>of</b> <b>dilation,</b> and distinguish between proper and improper dilation.
