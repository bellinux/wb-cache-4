5|$|After {{returning}} to Birmingham, Doyle soon linked up with Championship club Nottingham Forest on a short-term loan deal in December 2004. The loan was then extended {{to keep him}} at the City Ground {{for the rest of}} the season. Doyle made his first-team debut for Forest in a fifth-round FA Cup tie against Tottenham Hotspur on 20 February 2005. As the match approached half-time, Doyle gifted Tottenham the lead as a Jermain Defoe free kick bounced out of his hands and into the net, but Forest were able to equalise in the second half to take the tie to a replay. Even though Doyle only played in a further three league matches for Forest, he said he <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to play regular reserve-team football and the loan spell had exceeded his expectations. He was rumoured to be {{returning to}} Forest on loan for the following season, a move which did not occur.|$|E
25|$|Ewbank {{moved back}} to Oxford in {{retirement}} and wrote a book in 1977 called Football Greats. He {{was inducted into the}} Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1978, but said later that year that he <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> out of coaching. With the expansion of the NFL, he said, talent had become diluted and fielding a good team was difficult. Coaches, meanwhile, customarily took the blame for a team's failures, and the sport had become too violent.|$|E

25|$|In the 2009 offseason, the A's traded {{promising}} young star OF Carlos González, closer Huston Street and starting pitcher Greg Smith for Matt Holliday of the Colorado Rockies. On January 6, 2009, Jason Giambi signed a one-year, $4.6 {{million contract with}} a 2nd year option. Giambi said he <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> back as {{he put on his}} old number 16. Also signed were infielders Orlando Cabrera of the Chicago White Sox and Nomar Garciaparra of the Los Angeles Dodgers. The first half of the season the team played relatively poor, but finished the second half strong, yet still posting a losing record. Holliday was dealt to the St. Louis Cardinals for prospects and Giambi was released in August after spending time on the DL.|$|E
500|$|The show's final number, [...] "Roots Before Branches", {{was greatly}} praised. Although Hankinson was [...] "hoping for a Journey reprise" [...] {{or some other}} big group number, he noted that Rachel [...] "kill it", and Prinzivalli said [...] "Lea Michele shines as always". Strecker, Slezak and Chaney each gave the {{performance}} an [...] "A": Chaney called it a [...] "well-chosen song" [...] and Slezak wrote that he <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> introduced to it at the episode's [...] "triumphant ending for a girl chasing her dreams, not her delusions, {{in the streets of}} New York City".|$|E
500|$|McEvilly {{signed a}} {{permanent}} two-year deal with Cambridge the following 2008–09 season, after being released on a free transfer from Accrington Stanley. On 10 October, {{he was sent}} off in the 87th minute of Cambridge's 1–0 win over Weymouth, for violent conduct after the referee deemed a tackle to be dangerous. He went on to make 18 appearances for Cambridge scoring eight goals in the Conference National, {{before returning to the}} Football League to rejoin Rochdale, initially on loan in November, with the possibility of a permanent transfer in January. McEvilly stated he <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> back [...] "home" [...] at Rochdale.|$|E

[...] Governor of New Jersey Christopher J. Christie used his Twitter account to write that everything about the show was [...] "great". Beyoncé's husband and rapper Jay-Z, also wrote on Twitter that Beyoncé was the [...] "best performer in the world". A writer of Complex magazine further discussed his statements, [...] "Sure, he's married to her... But upon further reflection, he just might have a point. What other artist out there gives the type of live performance she does on a nightly basis? Who can give you that incredible voice singing power ballads and up-tempo dance cuts—while dancing?...

500|$|Caine {{had mixed}} {{feelings}} about both the production and the final version. He thinks {{that it was a}} first for him to be involved with someone his own age in a film. He compares the relationship between two middle-aged people to the romance between two teenagers. Although disappointed {{not to be able to}} collect an Academy Award because of filming in the Bahamas, he <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> involved in the film. In the press release, he explains that [...] "it is part of movie history... the original was one of the great all-time thrillers. I thought it might be nice to be mixed up with that. I liked the script very much." [...] However, Caine later claimed: [...] "I have never seen it , but by all accounts it is terrible. However, I have seen the house that it built, and it is terrific!" [...] In his 1992 autobiography What's it All About?, he says that the film [...] "will go down in my memory as the time when I won an Oscar, paid for a house and had a great holiday. Not bad for a flop movie." ...|$|E

On 28 July Leicester, who was in overall command of the English land troops, asked for instructions regarding De Vere, stating that [...] "he seems most willing to hazard his life in this quarrel".

2500|$|The Kinks left RCA Records in 1977, {{switching}} to Arista. The group shed {{all of the}} extra backing vocalists and brass instrumentalists that had accompanied them throughout their theatrical years, and reverted to a five-piece rock group again. Their debut LP for Arista was entitled Sleepwalker, and was a commercial and critical comeback for the group. It was the first album in what critics usually call the [...] "arena rock" [...] phase of the group, in which more commercial and mainstream production techniques would be employed. Dave later commented that he <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> back to more guitar-oriented songs, and he has listed Sleepwalker {{as one of his}} favourites. His composition and earnest, almost desperate lead vocals, not to mention his particularly ripping lead guitar sound, led to airplay — especially on college stations — for his idealistic [...] "Trust Your Heart" [...] on the 1978 Misfits album.|$|E

[...] "I look at it that religion {{is an important part of}} my life, but so is family and baseball", Marquis said. [...] "To me, family takes precedent [...] over all aspects of my life. Baseball and religion fall into place, and I try not to make one more important than the other." [...] Marquis did have to pitch on the holiday when he was with the Braves. It was his turn, and he did not want to throw the rotation out of order. [...] "I pitched, went to temple the next morning", Marquis said. [...] "It was a day game. Bobby [...] allowed me to show up late. It turned out well." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hitchcock <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{out from}} under Selznick's thumb. There would be [...] "no sudsy violins in big love scenes, no more {{recycling}} of Selznick's favorite cues from past movies. He made sure there were no south-of-the-border cliches." [...] Selznick's exit also brought Hitchcock and Webb together into their natural sympatico. [...] "Selznick deplored 'Hitchcock's goddamned jigsaw cutting,' the dreamlike, jagged images that create his signature subjectivity. But Webb didn't mind jigsaw cutting at all. It complemented his fragmented musical architecture, just as the blocked passions of the film's characters reflect his unresolved harmonies. Like Hitchcock, Webb favored atmosphere and tonal nuance over broad gestures. Both men were classicists dealing in darkness and chaos." [...] They featured complementary personalities, too: [...] "Webb had a modest ego, a handy trait when working for a control addict like Hitchcock." [...] Notorious was, however, their only film together.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{commentators}} such as Vasari and André Félibien {{praised the}} picture for its realism, but by the Victorian era writers began to regard the Mona Lisa as imbued {{with a sense of}} mystery and romance. [...] In 1859 Théophile Gautier wrote that the Mona Lisa was a [...] "sphinx of beauty who smiles so mysteriously" [...] and that [...] "Beneath the form expressed one feels a thought that is vague, infinite, inexpressible. One is moved, troubled ... repressed desires, hopes that drive one to despair, stir painfully." [...] Walter Pater's famous essay of 1869 described the sitter as [...] "older than the rocks among which she sits; like the vampire, she has been dead many times, and learned the secrets of the grave; and has been a diver in the deep seas, and keeps their fallen day about her." [...] By the early 20thcentury some critics started to feel the painting had become a repository for subjective exegeses and theories, and upon the painting's theft in 1911, Renaissance historian Bernard Berenson admitted that it had [...] "simply become an incubus, and I <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rid of her." ...|$|E
2500|$|The lead {{character}} of Dan Waziri posed a challenge; a Northerner {{is needed to}} play the role, and Afolayan stated {{that there is a}} particular [...] "look" [...] that has been associated with people of the sixties. He also pointed out that he needed an actor who could not only speak Hausa, but would represent the ethnic group as well. No one seemed to tick these essential boxes, until Sadiq Daba came to mind. However, his whereabouts were not known at the time as {{the last time he had}} been seen was in the 1998 Mahmood Ali-Balogun's short film A Place Called Home, produced by MNet Eventually, Afolayan was able to find a recent interview he granted, thereby getting connected to Daba through the interviewer. Sadiq Daba was prepared for Waziri's character for a period of 8 months before filming commenced. On a day of shoot, a serious disagreement occurred between Daba and Afolayan that Daba walked out on set; the dispute however was eventually settled and shooting was resumed. Daba in an interview expressed enthusiastically that Kunle Afolayan is a filmmaker he <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> associated with.|$|E

2500|$|D'Antoni's {{coaching}} {{debut with}} the Lakers was delayed as he recovered from knee replacement surgery. [...] He had surgery weeks before on October 31, as he originally expected {{that he was}} taking a year off from coaching and would have months to recover. Bickerstaff continued to be the Lakers' interim coach; he finished with a [...] 4–1 record, winning his last two as D'Antoni started leading team practices. Older brother Dan D'Antoni was named a new assistant coach and also assisted. In his first press conference, D'Antoni predicted that the Lakers, then 3–5 and ranked 20th in scoring with 96.5 points per game, should instead be scoring [...] "110–115 points a game". He wanted to revive Showtime. He reiterated general manager Mitch Kupchak's belief that the Lakers were built to win an NBA championship that season. D'Antoni <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> back with Nash, noting his unsuccessful stint with the New York Knicks without him. On November 20, he coached his first game—nine days after he was hired—in a 95–90 win against the Brooklyn Nets. The Lakers matched their worst start on the road (0–4) since the 1995–96 season, but snapped the streak with a 115–89 win over the Dallas Mavericks; it was also their first 100-point effort in the first four games under D'Antoni.|$|E
