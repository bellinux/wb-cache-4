5|$|Even {{though to}} me, a Japanese schoolgirl uniform {{is kind of}} like blackface, I am just in {{acceptance}} over it, because something is better than nothing.

5|$|Our dream {{began in}} the hearts of the {{students}} at Martin Luther King, Jr., Elementary School nearly ten years ago.

25|$|The {{simplest}} {{descriptions of}} diffraction {{are those in}} which the situation {{can be reduced to}} a two-dimensional problem. For water waves, this is already the case, as water waves propagate only {{on the surface of the}} water. For light, we can often neglect one dimension if the diffracting object extends in that direction over a distance far greater than the wavelength. In the case of light shining through small circular holes <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> to take into account the full three-dimensional nature of the problem.|$|E
25|$|The {{momentum}} equations {{are written}} {{primarily for the}} generic trajectory of a packet of flow travelling on a horizontal plane and taken at a certain elapsed time called t. The position of the packet {{is defined by the}} distance on the trajectory s=s(t) which it has travelled by time t. In reality, however, the trajectory is the outcome of the balance of forces upon the particle. In this section we assume to know it from the start for convenience of representation. When we consider the motion determined by the forces selected next, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> clues of which type of trajectory fits the particular balance of forces.|$|E

In March 2008, Boortz attracted controversy by playing an audiotape of a nine-year-old where he repeatedly ridiculed the child’s speech, leading to an unsuccessful FCC petition to deny Boortz’s employer the right to purchase five local radio stations.|$|E
