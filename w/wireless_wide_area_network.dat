40|$|Abstract—In a {{scenario}} where each peer of an ad-hoc wireless {{local area network}} (WLAN) receives one of many available video streams from a <b>wireless</b> <b>wide</b> <b>area</b> <b>network</b> (WWAN), we propose a network-coding-based cooperative repair framework for the ad-hoc peer group to improve broadcast video quality during channel losses. Specifically, we first impose network coding structures globally, and then select the appropriate video streams and network coding types within the structures locally, so that repair can be optimized for broadcast video in a rate-distortion manner. Innovative probability—the likelihood that a repair packet is useful in data recovery to a receiving peer—is analyzed in this setting for accurate optimization of the network codes. Our simulation results show that by using our framework, video quality can be improved by up to 19. 71 dB over un-repaired video stream and by up to 5. 39 dB over video stream using traditional unstructured network coding.

40|$|Abstract—Roaming across {{heterogeneous}} wireless networks such as <b>wireless</b> <b>wide</b> <b>area</b> <b>network</b> (WWAN) {{and wireless}} {{local area network}} (WLAN) poses considerable challenges, as it is usually difficult to maintain the existing connections and guarantee the necessary quality-of-service. This paper proposes a novel seamless and proactive end-to-end mobility management system, which can maintain the connections based on the end-to-end principle by incorporating an intelligent network status detection mechanism. The proposed system consists of two components, connection manager (CM) and virtual connectivity (VC). The CM, by using novel media access control-layer and physical-layer sensing techniques, can obtain accurate network condition, {{while at the same time}} reducing the unnecessary handoff and ping-pong effect. The VC can make mobility transparent to applications without additional network-layer infrastructure support using a local connection translation, and can handle mobility well in the network address translator and simultaneous movement cases using a subscription/notification service. The proposed system enjoys several unique advantages: 1) capable of reacting to roaming events proactively and accurately; 2) maintaining the connection’s continuity with small handoff delay; and 3) being a unified end-to-end approach for both IPv 4 and IPv 6 networks. We have built a prototype system and performed experiments to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed system.
