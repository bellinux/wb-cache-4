Together with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the IAEA developed a new symbol that would serve as an intuitive warning for large sources of ionizing radiation. The new symbol was published in 2007 as ISO 21482, and is intended to accompany the trefoil on internal components of devices containing dangerous sources to prevent persons from unknowingly disassembling them.|$|E
25|$|In {{classical}} Athens, it {{was used}} as an abbreviation for the Greek θάνατος (thanatos, “death”) and as it vaguely resembles a human skull, theta was used as a <b>warning</b> <b>symbol</b> of death, {{in the same way that}} skull and crossbones are used in modern times. It survives on potsherds used by Athenians when voting for the death penalty. Petrus de Dacia in a document from 1291 relates the idea that theta was used to brand criminals as empty ciphers, and the branding rod was affixed to the crossbar spanning the circle. For this reason, use of the number theta was sometimes avoided where the connotation was felt to be unlucky—the mint marks of some Late Imperial Roman coins famously have the sum ΔΕ or ΕΔ (delta and epsilon, that is 4 and 5) substituted as a euphemism where a Θ (9) would otherwise be expected.|$|E

50|$|The sign is {{commonly}} referred to as a radioactivity warning sign, but it is actually a warning sign of ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation is a much broader category than radioactivity alone, as many non-radioactive sources also emit potentially dangerous levels of ionizing radiation.

Non-ionizing radiation can also reach potentially dangerous levels, but this warning sign is different from the trefoil ionizing radiation <b>warning</b> <b>symbol.</b>|$|E

Hazard symbols may appear with different colors, backgrounds, borders and supplemental information in order to specify the type of hazard {{and the level of}} threat (for example, toxicity classes). Warning symbols are used in many places in lieu of or addition to written warnings as they are quickly recognized (faster than reading a written warning) and more universally understood, as the same symbol can be recognized as having the same meaning to speakers of different languages.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Residents {{of nursing}} homes often have {{difficulty}} swallowing (dysphagia), which complicates the administration of solid oral dosage formulations. Erroneously crushing medication is common, but few interventions have been tested to improve medication safety. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of <b>warning</b> <b>symbols</b> in combination with education on the frequency of erroneously crushing medication in nursing homes. Setting: This was a prospective uncontrolled intervention study with a preintervention and postintervention measurement. The study was conducted on 18 wards (total of 200 beds) in 3 nursing homes in the North of the Netherlands. Participants: We observed 36 nurses/nursing assistants (92 % female; 92 % nursing assistants) administering medication to 197 patients (62. 9 % female; mean age 81. 6). Intervention: The intervention consisted {{of a set of}} <b>warning</b> <b>symbols</b> printed on each patient's unit dose packaging indicating whether or not a medication could be crushed as well as education of ward staff (lectures, newsletter and poster). Primary outcome measure: The relative risk (RR) of a crushing error occurring in the postintervention period compared to the preintervention period. A crushing error was defined as the crushing of a medication considered unsuitable to be crushed based on standard reference sources. Data were collected using direct (disguised) observation of nurses during drug administration. Results: The crushing error rate decreased from 3. 1 % (21 wrongly crushed medicines out of 681 administrations) to 0. 5 % (3 / 636), RR= 0. 15 (95 % CI 0. 05 to 0. 51). Likewise, there was a significant reduction using data from patients with swallowing difficulties only, 87. 5 % (21 errors/ 24 medications) to 30. 0 % (3 / 10) (RR 0. 34, 95 % CI 0. 13 to 0. 89). Medications which were erroneously crushed included enteric-coated formulations (eg, omeprazole), medication with regulated release systems (eg, Persantin; dipyridamol) and toxic substances (eg, finasteride). Conclusions: Warning symbols combined with education reduced erroneous crushing of medication, a well-known and common problem in nursing homes...|$|R
40|$|This {{present study}} {{investigated}} {{the effects of the}} background color of safety symbols on the way people perceive hazard and risk and consequent compliance to the symbols. Thirty-one Hong Kong Chinese rated perceived hazardousness, perceived severity of injury, immediacy of consequences, and likelihood of compliance for 21 safety symbols with various background colors and symbol types. A color was not tested if it was the same as the color of the symbol. This study showed that background color significantly influenced perception of the <b>symbols.</b> For hazard <b>warning</b> <b>symbols</b> (black background was not tested) and mandatory action symbols (blue background was not tested), red produced the highest levels of perceived hazard, injury severity, consequence immediacy, and compliance.

40|$|Several {{household}} fires {{have occurred}} in the United States and Canada when flammable contact adhesive vapors were ignited by nearby pilot lights. While the Consumer Product Safety Commission banned the sale of extremely flammable adhesives in the U. S., its Canadian counterparts have focused more attention on product labeling.

The results suggest that although the generic meanings of these two symbols are well understood, people have difficulty inferring the specific safety precautions most necessary for this particular product, apparently because they do not realize that adhesive vapors, rather than the adhesive itself, pose the fire hazard. Users also tended to overestimate the significance of the toxicity hazard. This incorrect assessment was corrected for a subset of subjects by reading the product specific text provided {{on the back of the}} container.

40|$|This master thesis {{commenced}} in {{the beginning}} of September 2006. It was performed {{as a part of the}} project OPTIVe (Optimized System Integration for Safe Interaction in Vehicles). OPTIVe’s purpose is to investigate, evaluate and demonstrate methods and technical solutions for safe, efficient and cost effective integration of HMI systems in cars. It is a cooperative project between Volvo Car Corporation and Luleå University of Technology among others, which were also the assigners for this thesis. OPTIVe has executed surveys in USA and Sweden about which information instruments the driver desires to have displayed in the automobile and on which display. The purpose with this master thesis was to compile the answers regarding the instrument cluster and analyze which information instruments should be placed in that display. The results would be different design concepts suitable for Sweden and USA and if possible a concept suited for both countries. The result of the survey, when both countries were taken under consideration, was that the users desired to have the <b>warning</b> <b>symbols</b> Low oil pressure, Low fuel level, Parking brake engaged, High motor temperature, Charging system failure, and ABS failure displayed in the instrument cluster. The driver instruments desired were Speedometer, Fuel level and Motor temperature level indicator and no In-vehicle technology instruments. This lead to that four different concepts were designed which were suited for both countries. The first two concepts had a simple and clean design which was further developed into two new concepts with more decorations. When comparing the countries and the genders, instruments and <b>warning</b> <b>symbols</b> that will differ is the Tachometer, Low tire pressure and Engine in need of service. Testing the four concepts in the eye-track lead to discussions about changes and improvements that could be made and also, to a questionnaire handling the speedometer. The new questionnaire was conducted since it was discovered that the pointer of the speedometer in all four concepts was a new idea in this context and the question was if it attracted the drivers or not, if the standard speedometer was more popular, or if a combination of the two was more likely to please. The speedometer questionnaire showed that the idea itself was good but that a combination between the standard speedometer and the modern speedometer was more popular. The combination speedometer will therefore be used in all the concepts. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
