40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{measurement}} was to verify the drawbar characteristics of chosen tractors with different undercarriages. The tractors were of the same engine power as well as type of gearbox (PowerShift – gears full shifted while loaded). We were dealing with the <b>wheeled</b> <b>tractor</b> John Deere 8320 and crawler tractor John Deere 8320 RT. The measurement was implemented in the land register of Vrbovec (Znojmo region) {{in an area where}} green peas were grown as the main product and winter wheat as the preceding crop. The measured and the counterproductive tractors were interconnected by the rope containing strain-gauge force sensors. The <b>wheeled</b> <b>tractor</b> was decelerated by the tractor crawler. The tractor crawler was decelerated by two <b>wheeled</b> <b>tractors.</b> The <b>wheeled</b> <b>tractor’s</b> stress-strain properties were also measured applying two pressure rating alternatives. Variant A presented inflation pressure of 160 kPa on the front axle and of 140 kPa on the rear axle. Variant B applied inflation pressure of 120 kPa on the front axle and of 100 kPa on the rear axle. Measured and calculated findings reveal that the tractor crawler achieved higher drawbar power and lower specific tractive consumption and traction slip than the <b>wheeled</b> <b>tractor</b> with both variants of inflation. Comparing the stress-strain characteristics of the <b>wheeled</b> <b>tractor</b> with a different tire inflation illustrates that using variant B, higher drawbar power and lower specific tractive consumption and traction slip were measured...|$|R

For the measurements were used John Deere tractors with name 8320 R if a wheel and if 8320 RT crawler tractor, possessing the same engine power.

Subsequent comprehensive part of a field measurement looked at the analysis of data obtained from measurements of performance and energy parameters of tractor kits depending on the operating mode of the engine.

5000|$|They {{introduced}} a locomotive style, double-under mounted steam traction engine to the market. However, {{by this time}} track-type tractors and a combination combine-harvester were becoming more popular over the large steel tire <b>wheel</b> <b>tractor</b> and the stationary threshing machine. Continuing to grow, the company in 1916 purchased a former plant of the Kingman Plow Co., and in 1917 they acquired the Davis Manufacturing Co. engine plant in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, enabling Avery to build its own engines. J. B. Bartholomew had for several years been President of the Bartholomew Company, which manufactured Glide automobiles in Peoria Heights. In 1920 he decided to bring the plant into the Avery Co. fold and it was utilized to manufacture trucks. Avery employed four thousand people by this point. When the agricultural depression of the early 1920s struck, Avery's varied product offerings were expensive, and when farmers defaulted on their notes held by Avery dealers, the company's liberal credit policy badly hurt its finances. Farmers also showed increasing preference for track-type farm implements, and Avery failed to innovate with new products. They built one track-type tractor named the [...] "Trackrunner," [...] but were unsuccessful at perfecting it. Some machinery sold did not work as advertised, and Avery failed to fix the problems. Avery cut its work force in August 1920 by 90 per cent, to 250 workers. They replaced the tubular radiator style with an improved tubular cellular design, {{but it was not}} enough.|$|E
