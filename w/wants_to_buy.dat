If I had an infinite disjunction of all particular cups, it could stand in for the term cup, in its simple supposition in I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> a cup. This is called determinate supposition. That is when I say I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> a cup I mean some determinate cup, but I don't necessarily know which one yet.

25|$|New {{forms of}} New Media are {{emerging}} like Web 2.0 tools Facebook and YouTube, along with {{video games and}} the consoles they are played on. It is helping to make video games and video game consoles branch out into New Media as well. Gamers on YouTube post videos of them playing video games they like and {{that people want to}} watch. Cultural changes are happening because people can upload their gaming experiences to a Web 2.0 tool like Facebook and YouTube for the world to see. Consoles like the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 have WiFi connectivity and chat rooms on most of their video games that allow gamer-to-gamer conversations around the world. They also allow people to connect to YouTube, so if they stream/record a gamer, it allows for easy uploading to YouTube for the world to see. Even the older video game consoles are becoming new media because YouTube can display the walkthroughs and let's plays of the game. YouTube gaming is evolving because some YouTubers are getting wealthy and earning money from their videos. The more people that become YouTube members, the popular YouTube becomes and the more it starts emerging as a new source of media, along with video games and consoles. The chat room/online gaming/WiFi consoles are getting the highest increase in popularity because they are not only the most advanced, but because of the newest video games being created {{that the majority of the}} gaming community <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy,</b> play and watch. The older video games and consoles also get popularity, but from YouTube's capabilities of uploading them to the gamer's channels for everyone to see. The older games get popularity from the communities nostalgia of the game(s), and the old school graphics and gameplay that made people see how old-school technology was the best at some point in time. Facebook helps those video games and consoles get popularity as well. People can upload the videos they create to Facebook as well. Facebook is a much larger website with a lot more users, so people use Facebook to spread their gaming content as well.|$|E

His attempts at building the house frustrate Homer, and he curses loud enough for Todd to overhear. After Todd says [...] "hell no" [...] and [...] "damn" [...] at dinner, his father Ned eventually discovers that he learned those words from Homer. He complains to Homer, who in turn criticizes Ned's mustache. Ned promises to shave off his mustache in return for Homer curtailing uses of profanity. He promises to put money in a [...] "swear jar" [...] - 25 cents for each curse.|$|E
500|$|The episode's plot is {{loosely based}} on the American comedy film Paper Moon, which was also the {{inspiration}} for Bart and Homer's swindle of Ned Flanders in the episode. The title of the episode is a parody of the 1981 film The Great Muppet Caper. The title was pitched by Simpsons writer Matt Selman. The episode's ending lampoons the cliche of having twist endings {{at the end of}} heist films. ”Magic Palace”, the magic-themed restaurant that the Simpsons visit {{in the beginning of the}} episode, is a parody on The Magic Castle, a nightclub in the Hollywood district of Los Angeles, California. Marge's line [...] "I didn't say that for clapping" [...] is a reference to a speech given by John Wayne while he was intoxicated. Homer <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> a singing rubber fish after their first con. At the end of the episode, Bart exclaims “Cowabunga!”, a catch-phrase of the main characters in the animated television series Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. In the scene where Grampa joins Bart and Homer, Grampa mentions the film The Sting II.|$|E

[...] Sciarretto also noted that [...] "Cheers (Drink to That)" [...] would be very popular in bars and clubs because of the lyrical content. Andy Gill of The Independent called the song an anthem with which the weekend can start. Thomas Conner of the Chicago Sun-Times said that [...] "Cheers (Drink to That)" [...] is the best song on the album, saying [...] " [...] a wise, world-weary paean from a gal at the bar who's seen some stuff, has moved on and <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> everybody a round of fruity shots." [...] However, Chris Richards of The Washington Post stated that [...] "Cheers (Drink to That)" [...] did not meet his expectations and commented that the song is a lowlight in Rihanna's career, stating [...] "'Turn it around with another round,' Rihanna bellows over the mid slog, as if setting ad copy to music." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite its prevalence, {{the neoclassical}} {{synthesis}} had its Keynesian critics. A strain of disequilibrium or [...] "non-Walrasian" [...] theory developed that criticized the synthesis for apparent contradictions in allowing disequilibrium phenomena, especially involuntary unemployment, to be modeled in equilibrium models. Moreover, they argued, {{the presence of}} disequilibrium in one market must be associated with disequilibrium in another, so involuntary unemployment had to be tied to an excess supply in the goods market. Many see Don Patinkin's work as {{the first in the}} disequilibrium vein. Robert W. Clower (1965) introduced his [...] "dual-decision hypothesis" [...] that a person in a market may determine what he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy,</b> but is ultimately limited in how much he can buy based on how much he can sell. Clower and Axel Leijonhufvud (1968) argued that disequilibrium formed a fundamental part of Keynes's theory and deserved greater attention. Robert Barro and Herschel Grossman formulated general disequilibrium models in which individual markets were locked into prices before there was a general equilibrium. These markets produced [...] "false prices" [...] resulting in disequilibrium. Soon after the work of Barro and Grossman, disequilibrium models fell out of favor in the United States, and Barro abandoned Keynesianism and adopted new classical, market clearing hypotheses.|$|E

Panahi worked closely with Mohammadkhani, gaining her trust and acting out each scene for her to mimic while still adding her own personality to the performance. Panahi was most concerned about Mohammadkhani being able to cry on cue, so he would have her stare at him off camera while he started to cry, causing her to cry. Filming began in early April 1994 in Kashan, Iran and continued until early June. Panahi has stated that during the making of his feature debut he [...] "wanted to prove to myself that I can do the job, that I can finish a feature film successfully and get good acting out of my players." [...] He also stated that [...] "In a world where films are made with millions of dollars, we made a film about a little girl who <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> a fish for less than a dollar – this is what we’re trying to show." [...] In Iran, films depicting children are the most likely to avoid censorship or political controversy, and The White Balloon was screened exclusively in theatres that specialized in children's films. Because of this the film had low attendance on its initial run in Iranian theatres, with only 130,000 tickets sold.|$|E
