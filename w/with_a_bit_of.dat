He is a kind high school student who impersonates a girl at an all-girls school, which he {{transfers}} into per his grandfather's will. He spends his time with many fellow attendees, some of which live in the nearby dormitory, and enjoys helping them with any problems they may have. His childhood friend Mariya Mikado attends the school with him, and helps in his female transition.

He decides at that moment to remain a spectator and then hides behind a bush to relieve himself.|$|E

Warner was just 11 runs short of becoming only the second player after Chris Gayle to score a Twenty20 International century. His 89 was the second highest score on Twenty20 international debut; and the equal fifth highest score ever in Twenty20 internationals.|$|E
