25|$|The station {{signed on}} the air on September 26, 1954 as WINT, {{originally}} broadcasting its signal from a transmitter in Auburn. It was Fort Wayne's second television station to launch but was technically licensed to, and had studios in, Waterloo. The station's original owner, Tri-State Television (not {{to be confused with}} Tri-State Christian Television, owners of WINM channel 12), took advantage of peculiarities in Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules to direct the signal to Fort Wayne. Although the city <b>was</b> <b>big</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> support three full network affiliates, the FCC had originally allocated only a single station, WKJG-TV (now WISE-TV) on UHF channel 33, to the city. This circumstance attracted the attention of Congress and led to changes in how broadcast licenses were assigned.|$|E
25|$|By 1592, the Scottish {{community}} in Rome <b>was</b> <b>big</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> merit {{the building of}} Sant'Andrea degli Scozzesi (English: St Andrew of the Scots). It was constructed for the Scottish expatriate {{community in}} Rome, especially for those intended for priesthood. The adjoining hospice was a shelter for Catholic Scots who fled their country because of religious persecution. In 1615, Pope Paul V gave the hospice and the nearby Scottish Seminar to the Jesuits. It was rebuilt in 1645. The church and facilities became more important when James Francis Edward Stuart, the Old Pretender, set up residence in Rome in 1717, but were abandoned during the French occupation of Rome in the late 18th century. In 1820, although religious activity was resumed, {{it was no longer}} led by the Jesuits. Sant'Andrea degli Scozzesi was reconstructed in 1869 by Luigi Poletti. The church was deconsecrated in 1962 and incorporated into a bank (Cassa di Risparmio delle Province Lombarde). The Scottish Seminar also moved away. The Feast of St Andrew is still celebrated there on 30 November.|$|E

25|$|Fort de la Malmaison {{lay on the}} Chemin-des-Dames {{ridge and}} had been built {{as part of an}} entrenched camp north of the Aisne, in the Séré de Rivières system, {{designed}} by General Raymond Adolphe Séré de Rivières and built from the 1870s. The fort was in the northern angle between the Chemin-des-Dames and the Soissons–Laon road. The fortress casemates were tested with high explosives in 1887 and found to be insufficiently robust. Steel reinforced concrete had been added but in 1913, the fort was sold to a Laon contractor, to demolish and use the materials to build new barracks in town. A long tunnel, the Montparnasse Quarry lay on the northern slopes below the fort, on the route to Chavignon village {{at the foot of the}} ridge. The quarry <b>was</b> <b>big</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> shelter an infantry brigade. The fort was to the north-west of the quarry, on the summit of the plateau at the western end of the ridge and the dismantled work was surrounded by a moat filled with mud. The subterranean galleries had been rebuilt and garrisoned by the Germans in September 1914, the outworks and interior being provided with several ferro-concrete machine-gun nests. From the ramparts, the Germans could see all movement from the Ailette to the Aisne and on the spurs running down to the Aisne from the Chemin-des-Dames ridge.|$|E
25|$|After {{arriving}} in Egypt, Seleucus sent {{his friends to}} Greece to inform Cassander and Lysimachus, the ruler of Thracia, about Antigonus. Antigonus was now {{the most powerful of}} the Diadochi, and the others would soon ally against him. The allies sent a proposition to Antigonus in which they demanded that Seleucus be allowed to return to Babylon. Antigonus refused and went to Syria, where he planned to attack Ptolemy in the spring of 314 BC. Seleucus was an admiral under Ptolemy. At the same time he started the siege of Tyros, Antigonus allied with Rhodes. The island had a strategic location and its navy was capable of preventing the allies from combining their forces. Because of the threat of Rhodes, Ptolemy gave Seleucus a hundred ships and sent him to the Aegean Sea. The fleet was too small to defeat Rhodes, but it <b>was</b> <b>big</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> force Asander, the satrap of Caria, to ally with Ptolemy. To demonstrate his power, Seleucus also invaded the city of Erythrai. Ptolemy, nephew of Antigonus, attacked Asander. Seleucus returned to Cyprus, where Ptolemy I had sent his brother Menelaos along with 10,000 mercenaries and 100 ships. Seleucus and Menelaos began to besiege Kition. Antigonus sent most of his fleet to the Aegean Sea and his army to Asia Minor. Ptolemy now had an opportunity to invade Syria, where he defeated Demetrius, the son of Antigonus, in the battle of Gaza in 312 BC. It is probable that Seleucus took part in the battle. Peithon, son of Agenor, whom Antigonus had nominated as the new satrap of Babylon, fell in the battle. The death of Peithon gave Seleucus an opportunity to return to Babylon.|$|E

500|$|Agincourt mounted {{fourteen}} BL 12-inch Mk XIII 45-calibre guns {{in seven}} twin hydraulically powered turrets, unofficially {{named after the}} days of the week, starting from Sunday, forward to aft. This was the largest number of turrets and heavy guns ever mounted on a dreadnought battleship. The guns could be depressed to −3° and elevated to 13.5°. They fired [...] projectiles at a muzzle velocity of at 13.5°, this provided a maximum range of just over [...] with armour-piercing (AP) shells. During the war the turrets were modified to increase their maximum elevation to 16°, but this only extended the range to [...] The rate of fire of these guns was 1.5 rounds per minute.

[...] Instead there were only wooden “gridirons”, enormous frames of wood weighted down with rocks placed on a beach or mudflat. [...] When work was needed below the waterline of a vessel, the procedure was simply to float the ship over the gridiron, wait for the tide to run out, {{and work on the}} vessel as fast as possible before the tide came back in.

[...] There were also doubts whether the Zumwalt hull <b>was</b> <b>big</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> accommodate ballistic defense weapons, and a possible nuclear propulsion system. In July 2007 came the first suggestions that the AOA might recommend a two-class solution, a 14,000ton [...] "escort cruiser" [...] based on the Zumwalts stealthy [...] "tumblehome" [...] hull, and a ballistic missile defense ship of 23,000tons. The latter would use a more conventional shape than the tumblehome, as its use of radars to search for missiles while on station would make a stealthy hull pointless. In July 2008, Roscoe Bartlett of the House Seapower subcommittee stated that it was [...] "unlikely the [...] hull could be used in the CG(X) program".|$|E
2500|$|Finally, on May 19, 2002, Mayor Williams {{revealed}} {{the results of}} his two-year task force study.

2500|$|Both {{university}} {{systems are}} California publicly funded higher education institutions. [...] Despite having fewer students, some individual UC campuses, {{as a result}} of their research emphasis and medical centers, have larger budgets than the entire CSU system. According to a 2002 study, faculty at the CSU spend about 30 hours a week teaching and advising students and about 10 hours a week on research/creative activities, while a 1984 study reports faculty at the UC spend about 26 hours a week teaching and advising students and about 23 hours a week on research/creative activities. CSU's Chancellor, Dr. Charles B. Reed, pointed out when delivering his Pullias Lecture at the University of Southern California, that California <b>was</b> <b>big</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> afford two world-class systems of public higher education, one that supports research (UC) and one that supports teaching (CSU). [...] However, student per capita spending is lower at CSU, and that, together with the lack of a research mission or independent doctoral programs under the California Master Plan, has led some in American higher education to develop the perception that the CSU system is less prestigious than the UC system. [...] Kevin Starr, the seventh State Librarian of California, stated that the [...] "University of California drew from the top ten percent of the state's high school graduates" [...] while [...] "the CSU system was expected to draw its students from the top 33 percent of each graduating high school class."

2500|$|From about 1877 the silting of the {{channels}} started {{to improve and}} trade improved again. The improvement continued until 1889 when {{the construction of the}} Manchester Ship Canal caused problems. [...] Trade declined again and in 1894 the independent customs Port of Runcorn was abolished being incorporated in the Port of Manchester. [...] Construction of the ship canal began in November 1877. [...] On 3 August 1887 the Manchester Ship Canal Company had purchased the Bridgewater Navigation Company for £1,710,000, thus acquiring the Bridgewater Canal and its docks and the Mersey and Irwell system. [...] The ship canal allowed large ocean-going ships to travel to the Port of Runcorn. [...] The canal was completed from Eastham to Weston Point by 1892 and in July of that year a temporary port, called Saltport, was established {{at the mouth of the}} River Weaver. [...] By 1893 the ship canal was opened as far as the Old Quay Dock. [...] In order to allow direct access to the Port of Runcorn and the Weaver Navigation four locks were built. [...] Weston Marsh lock at the mouth of the Weaver allowed access to the Weaver Navigation, Weston Mersey lock enabled entrance to the Weaver Docks, the Bridgewater docks were served by the Bridgewater lock and the Old Quay dock by the Runcorn Old Quay lock. [...] The ship canal was opened throughout its length in 1894. [...] Saltport was bypassed and a few years later it was dismantled. [...] To the east of the Bridgewater Dock the ship canal passes under Runcorn Railway Bridge which has a clearance of [...] above the high water mark of the Mersey. [...] This meant that the larger of the tall ships could not pass under the bridge. [...] A lay-by was therefore built for these ships to discharge their cargo, which was carried onwards by a lighter to its destination. [...] The lay-by <b>was</b> <b>big</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> accommodate the largest merchant vessels of the day. [...] While the larger vessels approached the Runcorn docks by way of the ship canal, the smaller vessels sailed up the Mersey and entered the docks through the locks.|$|E
