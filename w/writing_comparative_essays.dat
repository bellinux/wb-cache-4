40|$|This <b>comparative</b> <b>essay</b> {{on mutual}} {{influences}} between Spanish and Argentinian authoritarian nationalisms shows that overseas hispanophiles were inspired on different peninsular doctrinal sources, like the Menéndez Pelayo's national-Catholicism, the liberalism of the Institución Libre de Enseñanza, the Miguel de Unamuno's casticism, the Ortega's europeanism, the D'Ors' classicism or the Maeztu's Hispanidad. From half-thirties to half-forties, the different trends of Spanish nationalism integrated in the Francoist regime failed {{to impose the}} disappearance of alternative liberaldemocratic and peripheral nationalisms in the Argentinian political debate. Although authoritarian Spanish nationalism influenced the activity of Argentinian catholic intellectuals in different ways, their real effect was very relative, because they acted only as circumstantial models to some Argentinian political regimes.

Berardinelli draws a parallel between An Unforgettable Summer and Before the Rain, by Macedonian director Milcho Manchevski, noting that, for all the difference in setting and approach, they deal with similar subjects.

40|$|Planning in {{contemporary}} democratic states is often {{understood as a}} range of activities, from housing to urban design, regional development to economic planning. This volume sees planning differently—as the negotiation of possibilities that time offers space. It explores what kind of promise planning offers, how such a promise is made, {{and what happens to}} it through time. The authors, all leading anthropologists, examine the time and space, creativity and agency, authority and responsibility, and conflicting desires that plans attempt to control. They show how the many people involved with planning deal with the discrepancies between what is promised and what is done. The <b>comparative</b> <b>essays</b> offer insight into the expected and unexpected outcomes of planning (from visionary utopias to bureaucratic dystopia or something in-between), how the future is envisioned at the outset, and what actual work is done and how it affects people’s lives...|$|R
