25|$|In {{a meeting}} of the Lower House Budget Committee in February 2006, Shinzō Abe said, 'There is a problem as to how to define {{aggressive}} wars; we cannot say it is decided academically', and 'It is not the business of the government to decide how to define the last world war. I think <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> for the estimation of historians'. However, on a TV program in July 2006 he denied that Manchukuo was a puppet state.|$|E
500|$|Following its release, Mississippi Burning became {{embroiled in}} {{controversy}} over its fictionalization of events; it was heavily criticized by African-American activists {{who were involved}} in the Civil Rights Movement, as well as the families of Goodman, Chaney and Schwerner. Coretta Scott King, widow of Martin Luther King, Jr., boycotted the film, stating, [...] "How long will <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> before Hollywood finds the courage and the integrity to tell the stories of some of the many thousands of black men, women and children who put their lives on the line for equality?" [...] Myrlie Evers-Williams, the wife of slain civil rights activist Medgar Evers, said of the film, [...] "It was unfortunate that it was so narrow in scope that it did not show one black role model that today's youth who look at the movie could remember." [...] Benjamin Hooks, the executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), stated that the film, in its fictionalization of historical events, [...] "reeks with dishonesty, deception and fraud" [...] and portrays African Americans as [...] "cowed, submissive and blank-faced".|$|E
2500|$|American {{experiments}} in 1978 and 1982 found {{the great majority}} of men were willing to have sex with women they did not know, of average attractiveness, who propositioned them. No woman, by contrast, agreed to such propositions from men of average attractiveness. While men were in general comfortable with the requests, regardless of their willingness ("Why do <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> until tonight?", [...] ", I'm married"), women responded with shock and disgust ("You've got to be kidding", [...] "What is wrong with you? Leave me alone").|$|E

2500|$|Yet The Watchtowers public {{coverage}} of the same series of conventions was notable for its far more cautious tone. In its summary of the convention talks, the magazine reiterated the teaching that Bible chronology showed 6000 years of human existence would be completed in the mid-1970s, then pointed out: [...] "These publications have never said that the world's end would come then. Nevertheless, there has been considerable individual speculation on the matter." [...] What was certain, the magazine said, was that the end would come within the generation of those who saw the beginning of world tribulations in 1914. [...] "So we can be confident that the end is near; {{we do not have}} the slightest doubt that God will bring it about ... <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> and see exactly when, in the meantime keeping busy in God's service." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the news}} broke {{at the end}} of the week tributes have poured in for the former Ajax and Netherlands legend, with all Eredivisie games {{featuring}} a round of applause on 14 minutes, Cruyff’s former shirt number. Ahead of their league game against Eibar at the Camp Nou (25 October 2015), Barcelona players showed their support for Cruyff by wearing orange T-shirts bearing the words 'Ànims Johan' (Catalan for 'Get well soon Johan'). Writing in his weekly De Telegraaf column, Cruyff admitted, “Often the media are an additional tax, but the last week that has been different. The way in which a reply is posted via a variety of media in my situation, was emotional and heartwarming. I am extremely proud of the appreciation shown by all responses.” On his condition, Cruyff added, “Meanwhile, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait.</b> It’s really annoying that it has been leaked so quickly, because the only thing I know now is that I have lung cancer. No more. Because the investigation is ongoing.” ...|$|E

60|$|MY DEAR OLD JOE AND HARMONY,--The baby is {{here and}} is the great American Giantess--weighing 7 3/4 pounds. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> a good long time for her, but she was full {{compensation}} when she did come.|$|R

6000|$|She was saying, {{in answer}} to a question: [...] "No, Dr. Weissmann, I {{have no control over}} the manifestations; in fact, the more anxious I am, the longer <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait.</b> I cannot promise {{anything}} to-night--" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Ay, ay, we saw it; {{but there}} is an officer with a boat-load of sailors ashore from the King's ship at Harwich.

6000|$|... "That's easy done, Mr. Montgomery," [...] {{said the}} fat-voiced publican. [...] "But before sayin' {{anything}} <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> and see whether, {{in a way}} of speakin', there was any need {{for us to say}} anything at all. Mr. Wilson thinks there is. Mr. Fawcett, who has the same right to his opinion, bein' also a backer and one o' the committee, thinks the other way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> for the Artesian ray," [...] she said, [...] "we {{must try}} to carry out {{something}} else. People are watching us, talking of us, expecting something of us; we must give them something. Now the question is, what shall that be?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I'll do {{the best}} I can to get a date," [...] Mr. Henslow said, grumblingly, [...] "but you fellows are always in such a hurry, and you don't {{understand}} that it don't go up here. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> our time month after month sometimes." ...|$|E
6000|$|NICHOLLS (embarrassed). Why, yes, in a way--but nothing definite--no {{official}} announcement {{or anything}} of that kind. It's all in the future. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait,</b> you know. (With a sentimental smile.) We've been sort of engaged for years, you might say. It's always been sort of understood between us. (He laughs awkwardly.) ...|$|E

60|$|The bus stopped again, {{and they}} trooped {{out into the}} hot sun. The priest scuffled round the corner this time. Not to go round the corner was no doubt harmful. We waited. A frown came between the bus Hamlet's brows. He looked nerve-worn and tired. It was about three o'clock. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> for a man from a village, with the post. And he did not appear.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{thought it}} was that, but <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> nearly another hour afore the two came aboard, to make sure. There was a {{difference}} in the way they came aboard, too, from that of the mate. They didn’t make no noise, and the fust thing we knew of their coming aboard was seeing a bare, black foot waving feebly {{at the top of the}} fo’c’s’le ladder feelin’ for the step.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{then you}} mustn't go. They might shoot {{you before you}} got away. Stay. If we hear them you can hide. I'll turn out the light. I'll meet them at the door. You can trust me.

6000|$|... "It can't be done, sir!" [...] the man groaned. [...] "There isn't a car {{ever built}} {{could get through}} that. See, it's nearly {{up to the top}} of those posts.

6000|$|... "Truly, {{it seems}} to me that {{resistance}} would be not bravery, but a sort of madness. There are promises of aid from England; but how long may <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> for them? And there are but ten days' provisions in the town. If these English officers of King William think that resistance is hopeless, why should I, who know nought of war, set myself against them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Nevertheless, {{we lived}} on there in a {{meaningless}} sort of way--I hardly knew why. To {{me it was a}} puzzle. When I asked Hilda, she shook her head with her sibylline air and answered, confidently: [...] "You do not understand Sebastian as well as I do. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> for HIM. The next move is his. Till he plays his piece, I cannot tell how I may have to checkmate him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'When I {{thought you}} would not have me, I meant to be an old maid,' said Theodora; 'and, Percy, this time you shall not think I do not care for you.

I could not give up that now, and'--as he pressed her hand--'mind, I am old enough to be trusted to choose poverty. I know I can live on a little: I trust to you to tell me whenever there is enough.' ...|$|E
60|$|If <b>we</b> <b>had</b> {{been the}} pilots, <b>we</b> would <b>have</b> bumped that old steamer over the bar, somehow or other, {{long before the}} real pilot started her in; but <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait.</b> When <b>we</b> did go in, and steamed along {{in front of the}} old fort, we could see that it was gray and crumbling, and moss-covered in places, and it was just like an oil-painting. The whole town, in fact, was like an oil-painting to us.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> {{for that}} it would be hopeless; but at the same time, as it must be evident to any {{individual}} of the meanest capacity that something or other for which troops will be required will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be done, surely a month ought to be sufficient for the idea to occur to some one in authority {{that it would}} be as well not to be sending soldiers abroad until matters are finally settled." ...|$|R
