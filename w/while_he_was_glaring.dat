[...] {{cried out}} the poor girl, hurt at the morbid perverseness and savage vanity of Pen. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>glaring</b> {{round in the}} {{direction}} of Mr. Pynsent as if {{he would have liked to}} engage that gentleman as he had done the cook.

5000|$|The 17 {{year old}} second prince, nicknamed [...] "The Glaring Prince". He has a {{reputation}} of being aloof and scary, and it's rumored that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{kicked out of the}} military academy for getting into brawls. As it turns out, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> suspended because <b>he</b> beat a student who bullied and abused his brother Bruno. He's actually a kindhearted, introverted young man who's bad at social interactions and likes cute things. He likes Heine because he's the first tutor to actually talk to him, and because he thinks of him as a cute pet. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> mistaken as scary because he has trouble speaking and often looks as if <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>glaring.</b> In the later chapters of the manga, Kai has returned to Military Academy and is currently away on a training trip.|$|R
50|$|The prize {{was named}} after Turner because <b>while</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> now {{considered}} one of the country's greatest artist, <b>while</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> active his work <b>was</b> controversial. <b>While</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> now looked at as a traditionalist, his new approach to landscape painting changed the course of art history, as many of the Turner Prize winners aspire to do.|$|R
60|$|Are we not all {{weary of}} him, that venerable impostor {{fresh from the}} steps of the Piazza di Spagna, who, in the leisure moments that he can spare from his {{customary}} organ, makes the round of the studios and is waited for in Holland Park? Do we not all recognise him, when, with the gay insouciance of his nation, he reappears on the walls of our summer exhibitions as everything that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not, and as nothing that <b>he</b> <b>is,</b> <b>glaring</b> at us here as a patriarch of Canaan, here beaming as a brigand from the Abruzzi? Popular <b>is</b> <b>he,</b> this poor peripatetic professor of posing, with those whose joy it is to paint the posthumous portrait of the last philanthropist who in his lifetime had neglected to <b>be</b> photographed,--yet <b>he</b> <b>is</b> the sign of the decadence, the symbol of decay.|$|R

50|$|In that pre-university stage, Elkhosht {{received}} prizes in many {{research and}} Qur'an competitions {{and at the}} level of the Arab Republic of Egypt. As a university student, Elkhosht had many books and research works published. His first book <b>was</b> published <b>while</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> still a freshman. And then his writings kept coming and were published by major Egyptian and Lebanese publishing houses <b>while</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> still a university student: his first book on the Qur'an <b>was</b> published <b>while</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a freshman. Later, major Lebanese publishing houses published his writings <b>while</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> still a student, such as Dar Alkitab Alarabi. Whoever read his writings at that time would believe that Elkhosht was such an old, experienced scholar.|$|R

60|$|I {{had turned}} out of Pall Mall into a side street, when whom should I strike against but her false swain! It was my fault, but I hit out at him savagely, as I always do when I run into anyone in the street. Then I looked at him. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> hollow-eyed; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> muddy; {{there was not a}} haw left in him. I never saw a more abject young man; he had not even the spirit to resent the testy stab I had given him with my umbrella. But this is the {{important}} thing: <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>glaring</b> wistfully at the post-office and thus in a twink I saw that he still adored my little governess. Whatever had <b>been</b> their quarrel <b>he</b> <b>was</b> as anxious to make it up as she, and perhaps <b>he</b> had <b>been</b> here every Thursday while she was round the corner in Pall Mall, each watching the post-office for an apparition. But from where they hovered neither could see the other.|$|R
