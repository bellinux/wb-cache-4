5|$|<b>Willow</b> <b>bark</b> {{preparations}} {{became a}} standard {{part of the}} materia medica of Western medicine beginning at least with the Greek physician Hippocrates in the fifth century BC; he recommended chewing on <b>willow</b> <b>bark</b> to relieve pain or fever, and drinking tea made from it to relieve pain during childbirth. The Roman encyclopedist Celsus, in his De Medicina of ca. 30 AD, suggested willow leaf extract to treat the four signs of inflammation: redness, heat, swelling and pain. Willow treatments also appeared in Dioscorides's De Materia Medica, and Pliny the Elder's Natural History. By the time of Galen, willow was commonly used throughout the Roman and Arab worlds, as {{a small part of}} a large, growing botanical pharmacopoeia.|$|E
5|$|The major {{turning point}} for {{salicylate}} medicines came in 1763, when a letter from English chaplain Edward Stone was read {{at a meeting of}} the Royal Society, describing the dramatic power of <b>willow</b> <b>bark</b> extract to cure ague—an ill-defined constellation of symptoms, including intermittent fever, pain, and fatigue, that primarily referred to malaria. Inspired by the doctrine of signatures to search for a treatment for agues near the brackish waters that were known to cause it, Stone had tasted the bark of a willow tree in 1758 and noticed an astringency reminiscent of the standard—and expensive—ague cure of Peruvian bark. He collected, dried, and powdered a substantial amount of <b>willow</b> <b>bark,</b> and over the next five years tested it on a number of people sick with fever and agues. In his letter, Stone reported consistent success, describing willow extract's effects as identical to Peruvian bark, though a little less potent. (In fact, the active ingredient of Peruvian bark was quinine, which attacked the infectious cause of malaria, while the active ingredient of willow extract, salicin, relieved the symptoms of malaria but could not cure it.) Stone's letter (mistakenly attributed to Edmund rather than Edward Stone) was printed in Philosophical Transactions, and by the end of the 18th century willow was gaining popularity as an inexpensive substitute for Peruvian bark.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} aspirin (also known as acetylsalicylic acid or ASA) {{and the medical}} use of it and related {{substances}} stretches back to antiquity, though pure ASA has only been manufactured and marketed since 1899. Medicines made from willow and other salicylate-rich plants appear in clay tablets from ancient Sumer {{as well as the}} Ebers Papyrus from ancient Egypt. Hippocrates referred to their use of salicylic tea to reduce fevers around 400 BC, and were part of the pharmacopoeia of Western medicine in classical antiquity and the Middle Ages. <b>Willow</b> <b>bark</b> extract became recognized for its specific effects on fever, pain and inflammation in the mid-eighteenth century.

5|$|In the 19th century, as {{the young}} {{discipline}} of organic chemistry began to grow in Europe, scientists attempted to isolate and purify the active components of many medicines, including <b>willow</b> <b>bark.</b> After unsuccessful attempts by Italian chemists Brugnatelli and Fontana in 1826, Joseph Buchner obtained relatively pure salicin crystals in 1828; the following year, Henri Leroux developed another procedure for extracting modest yields of salicin. In 1834, Swiss pharmacist Johann Pagenstecher discovered {{what he thought was}} a new pain-reducing substance, isolated from the common remedy of meadowsweet (Spiraea ulmaria). By 1838, Italian chemist Raffaele Piria found a method of obtaining a more potent acid form of willow extract, which he named salicylic acid. The German chemist who had been working to identify the Spiraea extract, Karl Jacob Löwig, soon realized that it was in fact the same salicylic acid that Piria had found.|$|E

25|$|Both beaver {{testicles}} and castoreum, a bitter-tasting secretion with {{a slightly}} fetid odor contained in the castor sacs of male or female beaver, have been articles of trade for use in traditional medicine. Yupik medicine used dried beaver testicles like <b>willow</b> <b>bark</b> to relieve pain. Dried beaver testicles were also used as contraception. Beaver testicles were used as medicine in Iraq and Iran during the tenth to nineteenth century. Aesop's Fables comically describes beavers chewing off their testicles to preserve themselves from hunters, which is not possible because the beaver's testicles are inside its body. This belief, also recorded by Pliny the Elder, persisted in medieval bestiaries.|$|E

Our men fashioned the wood into pipe stems, emergency snowshoes, snares, wooden nails, whistles for the children, beading looms, and frames for stretching hides. Rotted willow wood {{was used to}} smoke hides. Green willow branches were burned to smoke meat. We twisted the inner bark fibers into temporary rope, twine and fish nets. We weather proofed rawhide by wrapping it in <b>willow</b> <b>bark.</b> We used willow branches as lathing for our houses. Our men scraped off the inner cambium layer and added other ingredients, such as bearberry, to make a smoking mixture, ‘Kinnikinick’.

They are still used in Wales, where they were traditionally framed with split and interwoven willow rods, tied with <b>willow</b> <b>bark.</b> The outer layer was an animal skin, such as horse or bullock hide, with a thin layer of tar for waterproofing. Today tarred calico or canvas, or simply fibreglass can be used. Different Welsh rivers have their own designs, tailored to the flow of the river. The Teifi coracle, for instance, is flat bottomed, as it is designed to negotiate shallow rapids, common on the river in the summer, [...] while the Carmarthen coracle is rounder and deeper, because it is used in tidal waters on the Tywi, where there are no rapids.|$|E
2500|$|New {{patients}} who {{arrived at the}} Dwight institute were introduced into an open, informal environment where they were first offered as much alcohol as they could imbibe. Initially, patients were boarded in nearby hotels, such as the Dwight Livingston Hotel, or the homes of private residents. Later patients stayed in the converted John R. Oughton House. The institute operated out of homes and hotels using a spa like atmosphere of peace and comfort. [...] All patients received injections of bichloride of gold four times daily. There were other tonics given as well.(Tracy) The treatment lasted four weeks.(Larson pp.161-163.) The medical profession continued to criticize the method and many tried to identify the mysterious ingredients. [...] Strychnine, alcohol, apomorphine, <b>willow</b> <b>bark,</b> ammonia, and atropine were {{claimed to have been}} identified in the injections. The injections were dissolved in red, white and blue liquids and the amounts varied. In addition, patients would receive individually prescribed tonics every two hours throughout the day. Treatments lasted for a period of four weeks.|$|E
50|$|Salicin is an {{alcoholic}} β-glucoside. Salicin {{is produced in}} (and named after) <b>willow</b> (Salix) <b>bark</b> and acts as an anti-inflammatory agent in the human body. Salicin is also commonly found in the bark of Populus species, and the leaves of willows and poplars. It {{is also found in}} castoreum, which was used as an analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic. The activity of castoreum has been credited to the accumulation of salicin from willow trees in the beaver's diet, which is transformed to salicylic acid and has an action very similar to aspirin. Salicin was the historical origin of aspirin and is chemically related to it. When consumed, the acetalic ether bridge is broken down. The two parts of the molecule, glucose and salicyl alcohol, then are metabolized separately. By oxidizing the alcohol function the aromatic part finally is metabolized to salicylic acid. Salicin tastes bitter like quinine.|$|R
50|$|The bark {{that is left}} overtop of {{the diamond}} changes quite {{markedly}} from the bark over the living sapwood. Depending on the species of <b>willow,</b> the living <b>bark</b> is usually smoother and slightly lighter in color. The bark over the diamond usually becomes rougher and somewhat darker. It also becomes tougher and adheres much more to the underlying wood. The sapwood is white to cream in color—again depending on the species, {{but also on the}} location. The heartwood is reddish brown. This color tends to darken with exposure to light over a number of years.|$|R
50|$|Among the {{commercial}} products made from bark are cork, cinnamon, quinine (from {{the bark of}} Cinchona) and aspirin (from the <b>bark</b> of <b>willow</b> trees).

A HPTLC method has been developed for the quantitative determination of salicin in stem bark before and after alkaline hydrolysis. The mobile phase used for the separation is a modification of one described in the literature. a double or triple migration is necessary to separate salicin from other components of the extract. The results have been compared with those obtained after bidimensional chromatography using two phases described for the quantitative evaluation of salicin. to check that separation was complete, the spectrum of salicin obtained from willow extracts was superimposed on that of a salicin standard.

40|$|Recent {{national}} and international emission legislations to reduce {{emissions of carbon dioxide}} are forcing power generation industries using coal to look at various alternatives, such as biomass and especially by co-firing techniques. Biomass is transported to the burners either mixed with the primary fuel, in general, coal, or used in dedicated pipelines. In both cases, transportation of biomass is difficult due to its composition, size, shape and physical behaviour in comparison to the transportation of coal. This study considers experimental measurements for biomass particle transportation in a pipeline with a transverse elbow and compares the results with those using computation fluid dynamic (CFD) techniques. Various materials: flour, <b>willow,</b> wood, <b>bark</b> and a mixture of flour and willow, have been considered in the present investigation. The experimental work was performed using the dynamic changes in the electrostatic charges of biomass particles in conjunction with correlation signal processing techniques. The CFD simulations were performed by considering the effects of gravity, non-spherical drag (based on estimated shape factor), detailed information of the particle distribution, particle wall collisions and particle–particle interactions. Good quantitative and qualitative agreement was obtained between the CFD simulations and the experimental data. It is concluded that particle–particle interactions are of less importance if the mass loading ratio of particles to air is less than 0. 03...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to acquire basic {{information}} on the physical and chemical structure of <b>willow</b> inner <b>bark</b> {{in order to assess}} its potential as a raw material for chemicals and fibres. Inner bark from four cultivated willow species/hybrids was studied and compared with their wood tissue. The cell and cell wall structure was studied by optical microscopy, SEM and TEM. The fibres were separated with an acid chlorite treatment and analyzed for their dimensions and morphology. The chemical composition was determined by standard methods including quantification of ash, extractives (extraction with acetone), lignin and carbohydrates. FTIR spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy were applied as additional characterization methods. In comparison with willow wood fibres the sclerenchyma fibres of inner bark were much longer and they had higher aspect ratio. The inner bark fibres were thick-walled and their lumina were almost nonexistent. The inner bark had almost ten times as high ash and extractives contents as the willow wood had. The lignin-to-polysaccharide ratio was similar in wood and bark although pectin/arabinogalactan was the dominant heteropolysaccharide in inner bark over xylan in wood. The excellent fibre properties and the high extractives content of inner bark may justify its separation from willow biomass for production high-value special fibres and specific extractive-based chemical compounds. The debarked biomass could be used for production of sugars, lignin and their derivatives...|$|R
