5|$|Blacklist {{graphics}} {{and lack of}} difficulty were criticized. McCaffrey found the visuals unimpressive and most character models to be ugly; he also noted technical problems, such as screen-tearing and frame rate issues. Bloodworth criticized the game's invisible wall and unresponsive controls in certain segments, although he thought those minor issues did not drag down its overall experience. McCaffrey noted that even when {{the game is played}} in perfectionist mode, it is less challenging than its predecessors. He thought Blacklist gave players too many rewards, making its universal-economy system a useless feature. Bloodworth <b>was</b> <b>puzzled</b> by the game's unlock system, which he said hindered its credibility.|$|E
5|$|When the British {{governor}} of Uganda, Sir Harry Johnston, discovered some pygmy {{inhabitants of the}} Congo being abducted by a showman for exhibition, he rescued them and promised to return them to their homes. The grateful pygmies fed Johnston's curiosity about the animal mentioned in Stanley's book. Johnston <b>was</b> <b>puzzled</b> by the okapi tracks the natives showed him; while he had expected {{to be on the}} trail of some sort of forest-dwelling horse, the tracks were of a cloven-hoofed beast.|$|E
5|$|The (as McKay {{liked to}} point out, undefeated) team made their game debut against the Los Angeles Rams in an {{exhibition}} at the Los Angeles Coliseum on July 31, losing 26-3. McKay called the players’ performance “unaggressive, uninspiring, lethargic, and unacceptable”, and cut 15 players one day prior to the following Tuesday’s cutdown date. McKay {{was pleased with the}} following week’s improved performance against the Green Bay Packers, a 10–6 loss in which a late interception of a Parnell Dickinson pass prevented a likely Buccaneer victory. After the Packers referred to them as the “Tampa Buccaneers”, the Buccaneers threatened to introduce the “Green Packers” at their next meeting. The Buccaneers’ first victory came in a 17–3 preseason win over the favored Atlanta Falcons, in which they scored on runs by Steve Spurrier and Essex Johnson, and a Mirro Roder field goal. Although the win had no official significance, it raised optimism among fans, particularly due to the team’s defensive performance. McKay himself <b>was</b> <b>puzzled,</b> unsure whether the win was due to a superior performance by Tampa Bay, or a lack of effort by the Falcons. Their home debut came in a 28–21 loss to the Miami Dolphins, in front of a crowd of 71,718, a crowd which Dolphins owner Joe Robbie said proved his longtime prediction that a Bay Area team would be a success.|$|E

40|$|Economists {{have long}} <b>been</b> <b>puzzled</b> by the {{observations}} that during peacetime industrial market economies display recurrent, large fluctuations in output and employment over {{relatively short time}} periods. Not uncommon are changes as large as 10 percent within {{only a couple of}} years. These observations <b>are</b> considered <b>puzzling</b> because the associated movements in labor's marginal product are small. These observations should not <b>be</b> <b>puzzling,</b> for they <b>are</b> what standard economic theory predicts. For the United States, in fact, given people's ability and willingness to intertemporally and intratemporally substitute consumption and leisure and given the nature of the changing production possibility set, it would <b>be</b> <b>puzzling</b> if the economy did not display these large fluctuation...|$|R

My difficulty is, why are caterpillars sometimes so beautifully & artistically coloured?" [...] Darwin <b>was</b> <b>puzzled</b> because his theory of sexual selection (where females choose their mates based on how attractive they are) could not apply to caterpillars since they are immature and hence not sexually active.|$|E

Smith's candidacy may have been hampered by the number of outstanding relievers on the ballot; Sutter had earned increasing vote totals for nine years before Smith appeared on the ballot, and Gossage—who first appeared on the ballot three years before Smith—has received greater support in each year from 2004 until his induction in 2008.|$|E

Though Chakravarty <b>was</b> <b>puzzled</b> by Ishaan's trouble in simple arithmetic—a trait of dyscalculia rather than dyslexia—he reasoned {{it was meant to}} [...] "enhance the image of [...] helplessness and disability". Labeling Ishaan an example of [...] "dyslexic savant syndrome", he especially praised the growth of Ishaan's artistic talents after receiving help and support from Nikumbh, and deemed it the [...] "most important (and joyous) neurocognitive phenomenon" [...] of the film.

[...] Several other companies had already announced plans for similar software at the time; Alan Reiter from Wireless Internet and Mobile Computing <b>was</b> <b>puzzled</b> at Motorola's announcement of Myosphere, saying [...] "They're kind of late to the [...] party. But the party is likely to be very big. ... Motorola's entry will help further legitimize the value of voice response systems. But it's a tough market, and it will take time."

500|$|Elliott {{was also}} the one who hired Hayden Fry as Iowa's {{football}} coach in 1979. [...] Fry later said that Elliott {{was one of the}} principal reasons he chose to coach at Iowa. [...] In his autobiography, Fry wrote: [...] "Iowa had one thing in its favor as far as I was concerned: Bump Elliott was its athletic director. [...] Bump had a reputation as being a fair, honest and well-liked administrator." [...] Elliott told Fry that he would be the last football coach Bump ever hired. [...] Fry <b>was</b> <b>puzzled</b> and asked Elliott what he meant. [...] Elliott said, [...] "Simple, I don’t think they’ll {{give me a chance to}} hire another coach, so if you don’t make it, neither will I."

500|$|Davis {{was happy}} to have an episode of his own, but <b>was</b> <b>puzzled</b> {{at some of the}} contradictions in the script, such as having him assassinate John F.

Chris Carter said [...] "I had to speak with Bill several times; I spent hours with him on the telephone talking about the character, because the actor felt that the episode really made the character something that it wasn't. I tried to explain to him, as I think Jim and Glen were trying to express, that even if your mission in life is a destroyer, that you still have some hope {{in the back of your}} mind that you can be a creator— and that this all of a sudden, this vanity, is his vanity. And we see that so clearly here and it makes him sort of a silly person".|$|E
500|$|Its {{cooperative}} gameplay was {{preferred by}} critics over single-player mode, but critics were {{confused by the}} game's lack of local co-op.

In David Jenkins' review for the British news site Metro, the co-op was [...] "fun no matter what". On USgamer, Jaz Rignall <b>was</b> <b>puzzled</b> about it not being a feature when the game was released, saying that it would be the [...] "perfect game for couch co-op". Although GamesRadar Ben Tyrer enjoyed the game, he also believed that it would benefit from having a [...] "tense, pad-crushing, couch co-op" [...] feature.

In later years, Overmars criticised {{the expansion of the}} Champions League to include non league champions: [...] "When I won it with Ajax it was only the teams who finished first who took part. It's not special any more. I think the Champions' League is just a starter for {{what they want to do}} in the future, create a European League." [...] Overmars' exposure to European football had prompted him to be a sought-after player in England.

500|$|Although Evanescence was {{originally}} promoted in Christian stores, the band later {{made it clear}} that they did not want to be associated with Christian rock.

500|$|Shen {{also wrote}} that since petrified bamboos were found {{underground}} in a climatic {{area where they}} had never been known to be grown, the climate there must have shifted geographically over time. Around the year 1080, Shen Kuo noted that a landslide on the bank of a large river near Yanzhou (modern Yan'an) had revealed an open space several dozens of feet under the ground once the bank collapsed. This underground space contained hundreds of petrified bamboos still intact with roots and trunks, [...] "all turned to stone" [...] as Shen Kuo wrote. Shen Kuo noted that bamboos do not grow in Yanzhou, located in northern China, and he <b>was</b> <b>puzzled</b> during which previous dynasty the bamboos could have grown. Considering that damp and gloomy low places provide suitable conditions for the growth of bamboo, Shen deduced that the climate of Yanzhou must have fit that description in very ancient times. Although this would have intrigued many of his readers, the study of paleoclimatology in medieval China never developed into an established discipline.|$|E
