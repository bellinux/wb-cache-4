[...] It is an above-ground retorting technology, which uses externally generated hot gas for the oil shale pyrolysis. [...] After mining, the shale is transported by trucks to a crusher and screens, where it is reduced to particles (lump shale). These particles are between 12 mm and 75 mm and have an approximately parallelepipedic shape. [...] These particles are transported on a belt to a vertical cylindrical vessel, where the shale is heated up to about [...] for pyrolysis. [...] Oil shale enters through the top of the retort while hot gases are injected {{into the middle of the}} retort. The oil shale is heated by the gases as it moves down. As a result, the kerogen in the shale decomposes to yield oil vapor and more gas. Cold gas is injected into the bottom of the retort to cool and recover heat from the spent shale. Cooled spent shale is discharged through a water seal with drag conveyor below the retort.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} possibilities {{to separate}} particles with difficult dust properties from gases. Difficult dust properties {{are related to}} extreme values of particle size and shape and to the flowability, the adhesion properties or the reactivity of the particles. Special emphasis is given to submicron particles. In cyclones, conductive particles such as diesel soot can be removed by means of additional electrostatic forces. Experimental investigations into <b>wet</b> tubular <b>electrostatic</b> <b>precipitators</b> show that the measured separation efficiencies are much higher than theoretically anticipated. This result is explained by higher particle charges than predicted by the existing charging models. For small flow rates where <b>electrostatic</b> <b>precipitators</b> are economically not feasible, {{a new type of}} wet scrubber may be an alternative. The critical issue of surface filters is the adhesion of the dust cake at the surface of the filter medium. Regeneration of the dust cake as well as trends for the separation efficiency can be determined by small coupon testers which can be used for lab investigations and for field tests. Surface filters are widely used in industry for the separation of nanoparticles. Even extremely sticky particles such as tar particles can be removed by surface filters if a precoat layer protects the filter medium.

40|$|This study {{reports the}} impacts of two {{commercial}} <b>wet</b> <b>electrostatic</b> <b>precipitators</b> (WESPs) on the emission of fine particulate matter (PM 2. 5) and SO 3. Field measurements were carried out at two 300 MW coal-fired power station units equipped with WESPs between limestone-gypsum wet flue gas desulfurization (WFGD) unit and the stack. PM samples were collected at the inlet and outlet of the WESPs {{as well as the}} inlet and outlet of the dry ESP, and SO 3 was collected at the inlet and outlet of the WESP. The results show that 99. 21 % of the PM 2. 5 emitted from the boiler is removed in the dry ESP. The WFGD has a removal efficiency of 24. 19 % for PM 2. 5 but produces new gypsum particles and then increases the emission of PM 1 (by ∼ 24 %). PM at the WESP inlet is centered at 1 μm, and after passing through the WESP, concentrations of PM 0. 3, PM 1, and PM 2. 5 are reduced by 73. 72 – 93. 75 %, 83. 33 – 94. 41 %, and 79. 91 – 90. 23 %, respectively. SO 3 emission is also reduced by the WESP due to the capture of H 2 SO 4 via electrostatic force and the absorption of SO 3 by the basic sprayed liquid, with a removal efficiency of 52. 03 – 59. 09 %. However, new PM larger than 2 μm is generated from the entrainment of circulating liquid droplets in the WESP, which partially offsets the capture of PM 2. 5. As the boiler load decreases from 100 % to 70 %, the removal efficiency of PM 0. 3 increases a little, whereas the removal efficiencies of PM 1 and PM 2. 5 decrease from 89. 34 % and 89. 85 % to 83. 33 % and 79. 71 % due to the decreased removal efficiency for PM larger than 2 μm.

At a short gas residence time, SO 2 gas removed more quickly by a mist of NaClO 2 solution than NO gas in simultaneous removal experiments.

To support these tests, an existing DM 10 system installed at Vitreous State Laboratory (VSL) was modified to add the required recycle loop. Based on the Hanford Tank Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP) LAW off-gas system design, suitably scaled versions of the Submerged Bed Scrubber (SBS), <b>Wet</b> <b>Electrostatic</b> <b>Precipitator</b> (WESP), and TLP vacuum evaporator were designed, built, and installed into the DM 10 system. Process modeling was used to support this design effort {{and to ensure that}} issues associated with the short half life of the {sup 99 m}Tc radioisotope that was used in this work were properly addressed and that the system would be capable of meeting the test objectives. In particular, this required that the overall time constant for the system was sufficiently short that a reasonable approach to steady state could be achieved before the {sup 99 m}Tc activity dropped below the analytical limits of detection. The conceptual design, detailed design, flow sheet development, process model development, Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) development, control system design, software design and development, system fabrication, installation, procedure development, operator training, and Test Plan development for the new system were all conducted during this project. The new system was commissioned and subjected to a series of shake-down tests before embarking on the planned test program. Various system performance issues that arose during testing were addressed through a series of modifications in order to improve the performance and reliability of the system. The resulting system provided a robust and reliable platform to address the test objectives...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} to our {{knowledge}} the first to evaluate the potential of a <b>wet</b> <b>electrostatic</b> <b>precipitator</b> (WESP) to prevent aerosol formation issues inside amine based carbon capture installations. A WESP is a suitable option since this study proves {{that it is very}} efficient for the removal of the mist precursors inside the flue gas to be treated. Although a significant capital investment cost may be involved, energy requirements (i. e. low pressure drop), maintenance and therefore operational costs are expected to be very low. However, it is shown here that the WESP must be installed at the right location, i. e. the flue gas to be treated must contain no or very low levels of SO 2. The reason is that the WESP's aerosol removal efficiency decreases strongly in the presence of SO 2 gas and in a certain range also with increasing voltages. This limits the positive effect that the WESP has on reducing the MEA emissions from the absorber since a large number of mist formation precursors remain in the flue gas. In the presence of SO 2, a WESP can actually produce H 2 SO 4 aerosols. It is shown that these newly created aerosols are very small (low nanometre range). This information is very important for future pilot and demo amine carbon capture installations thinking of implementing a WESP as countermeasure to aerosol formation issues. It implies that no or very low levels of SO 2 should still be present in the flue gas before entering the WESP. Since most of the amine carbon capture installations have a pre-scrubber (usually using NaOH to remove residual SO 2 in the flue leaving the power plant's FGD) in front of their amine absorber, the WESP must be installed behind this pre-scrubber and not in front of it...|$|E
