500|$|In 1989, Lindsay Doran, the new {{president}} of production company Mirage Enterprises, was on a company retreat brainstorming potential film ideas when she suggested the Jane Austen novel Sense and Sensibility to her colleagues. It had been adapted three times, most recently in a 1981 television serial. Doran was a longtime fan of the novel, and had vowed in her youth to adapt it if she ever entered the film industry. She chose to adapt this particular Austen work because there were two female leads. Doran stated that [...] "all of [...] books are funny and emotional, but Sense and Sensibility is the best movie story because it's full of twists and turns. Just <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> know what's going on, everything is different. It's got real suspense, but it's not a thriller. Irresistible." [...] She also praised the novel for possessing [...] "wonderful characters... three strong love stories, surprising plot twists, good jokes, relevant themes, and a heart-stopping ending." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Duel" [...] {{was written}} by Jennifer Celotta, a {{producer}} and show runner with The Office. The episode featured {{the conclusion of the}} love triangle between Dwight, Andy and Angela, a subplot that had been going on since the fourth season finale, [...] "Goodbye, Toby". The cast and writing staff saw [...] "The Duel" [...] as a defining episode for Andy Bernard because it demonstrated a softer, more emotional side of the character. Dean Holland, who directed the episode, said this was particularly effective because in past episodes, he displayed such rage problems that he had to attend anger management courses, but in [...] "The Duel" [...] he responded to horrible news in a heartrending way. Rainn Wilson particularly praised Ed Helms' performance, saying, [...] "He gives a lot of heart and soul, and Andy is such a doofus and a douche, and now you really get to see his heart break. There's some reality there. That's the great thing this show gives us, just <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> know the characters and they're two-dimensional and they're goofy and crazy, in their own way, you get real human redemption." ...|$|E
2500|$|A more {{positive}} review from Rolling Stone {{said that the}} film had a [...] "great title and appealing performances" [...] from Lane and Cusack. Giving the film {{three out of four}} stars, the review also said that [...] "Just <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> have Goldberg figured, he springs fresh surprises." [...] Ann Hornaday from The Washington Post noted the film [...] "works because Lane is one of those actresses who can do just about anything and still earn the audience's undying love." [...] Hornaday mentioned that the movie [...] "features an enormously appealing supporting cast" [...] and commented on how well Lane and Cusack worked together on the film.|$|E

2500|$|A {{number of}} illustrative metaphors {{have been used}} to {{describe}} Petrosian's style of play. Harold C. Schonberg said that [...] "playing him was like trying to put handcuffs on an eel. There was nothing to grip." [...] He {{has been described as a}} centipede lurking in the dark, a tiger looking for the opportunity to pounce, a python who slowly squeezes his victims to death, and as a crocodile who waits for hours to make a decisive strike. Boris Spassky, who succeeded Petrosian as World Chess Champion, described his style of play as such: [...] "Petrosian reminds me of a hedgehog. Just <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> have caught him, he puts out his quills." ...|$|E

60|$|So far as I {{am able to}} judge, {{nothing has}} been left undone, either by man or Nature, to make India the most {{extraordinary}} country that the sun visits on his round.

Always, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> have {{come to the end of}} her tremendous specialties and have finished hanging tags upon her as the Land of the Thug, the Land of the Plague, the Land of Famine, the Land of Giant Illusions, the Land of Stupendous Mountains, and so forth, another specialty crops up and another tag is required. I have been overlooking the fact that India is by an unapproachable supremacy--the Land of Murderous Wild Creatures. Perhaps it will be simplest to throw away the tags and generalize her with one all-comprehensive name, as the Land of Wonders.|$|E

Piazon commented on his playing style, [...] "I'd say my playing style is different from typical Brazilian forwards. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about these, <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about dribbles and flashy moves.

[...] "And so you thought you had good reasons for disobeying me," [...] rejoined George. [...] "Yes," [...] said Egbert, triumphantly. [...] "That is just it," [...] said George. [...] "You are willing to obey, except <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> have good reasons for disobeying, and then you disobey.

60|$|In some few cases, indeed, {{among the}} shark and ray family, the {{mechanism}} for protection goes {{a step or}} two further than in these simple kinds. That well-known frequenter of Australian harbours, the Port Jackson shark, lays a pear-shaped egg, with a sort of spiral staircase of leathery ridges winding round it outside, Chinese pagoda wise, so that even if you bite it (I speak in the person of a predaceous fish) it eludes your teeth, and goes dodging off screw-fashion into the water beyond. There's no getting at this evasive body anywhere; <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> have it, it wriggles away sideways, and refuses to give any hold for jaws or palate. In fact, a more slippery or guileful egg was never yet devised by nature's unconscious ingenuity. Then, again, the Antarctic chimæra (so called from its very unprepossessing personal appearance) relies rather upon pure deception than upon mechanical means for the security of its eggs. The shell or case in this instance is prolonged at the edge into a kind of broad wing on either side, so that it exactly resembles one of the large flat leaves of the Antarctic fucus in whose midst it lurks. It forms the high-water mark, I fancy, of protective resemblance amongst eggs, for not only is the margin leaf-like in shape, but it is even gracefully waved and fringed with floating hairs, as is the fashion with the expanded fronds of so many among the gigantic far-southern sea-weeds.|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope not, indeed, Oswald. It was a sore fight, and we {{are scarce}} {{likely to have a}} pitched battle with these Welsh carls. They fight not much in our fashion, as I have heard; but dash down from their hills, and carry fire and sword through a district, and are off again before a force can be {{gathered}} to strike a blow. Then there are marches to and fro among their hills, but it is like chasing a will-o'-the-wisp; and like enough, just <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> have got them cooped up, and prepare to strike a heavy blow, they are a hundred miles away, plundering and ravaging on our side of the frontier. They are half-wild men, short in stature, and no match for us when it comes to hand-to-hand fighting; but broad in the shoulder, tireless, and active as our shaggy ponies, and well-nigh as untamable. 'Tis fighting in which there is little glory, and many hard knocks to be obtained; but it is a good school for war. It teaches a man to be ever watchful and on his guard, prepared to meet sudden attacks, patient under difficulties; and, what is harder, {{to be able to go}} without eating or drinking for a long time, for they say that you might as well expect to find corn and ale on the crest of the Grampians, as you would on the Welsh hills." ...|$|E

60|$|An {{embankment}} ten {{or fifteen}} feet high guards both banks of the Mississippi {{all the way down}} that lower end of the river, and this embankment is set back {{from the edge of the}} shore from ten to perhaps a hundred feet, according to circumstances; say thirty or forty feet, as a general thing. Fill that whole region with an impenetrable gloom of smoke from a hundred miles of burning bagasse piles, when the river is over the banks, and turn a steamboat loose along there at midnight and see how she will feel. And see how you will feel, too! You find yourself away out in the midst of a vague dim sea that is shoreless, that fades out and loses itself in the murky distances; for you cannot discern the thin rib of embankment, and you are always imagining you see a straggling tree when you don't. The plantations themselves are transformed by the smoke, and look like a part of the sea. All through your watch you are tortured with the exquisite misery of uncertainty. You hope you are keeping in the river, but you do not know. All that you are sure about is that you are likely to be within six feet of the bank and destruction, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> are a good half-mile from shore. And you are sure, also, that if you chance suddenly to fetch up against the embankment and topple your chimneys overboard, you will have the small comfort of knowing that it is about what you were expecting to do. One of the great Vicksburg packets darted out into a sugar plantation one night, at such a time, and had to stay there a week. But there was no novelty about it; it had often been done before.|$|E
