5|$|A First Avenue line, {{consisting}} of four tracks, <b>would</b> stretch from the Harlem River to City Hall. At 10th Street, the line <b>would</b> {{cease to be}} a four-track line, with the line splitting into two branches. One branch <b>would</b> run to a loop near City Hall, while the other <b>would</b> go to a new Lafayette Avenue line in Brooklyn, running via Third Avenue and the Bowery. On the northern end, at 161st Street, the line <b>would</b> split into two 3-track lines. One of the lines <b>would</b> go to Southern Boulevard and Fordham Road; the other <b>would</b> continue to 241st Street after merging with the existing IRT White Plains Road Line at Fordham Road and Webster Avenue.|$|E
5|$|A {{black hole}} {{could be the}} power source instead of a star in order to {{increase}} the matter-to conversion efficiency. A black hole <b>would</b> also be smaller than a star. This <b>would</b> decrease communication distances that <b>would</b> be important for computer-based societies as those described above.|$|E
5|$|A {{connection}} between the Seventh Avenue Extension and the Rockaway Line <b>would</b> be built at 99th Street, costing $9,200,000.The Rockaway Beach Branch of the LIRR <b>would</b> be purchased and converted for subway operation. Service to the Rockaway <b>would</b> be provided through {{a connection to the}} IND Queens Boulevard Line. The extension <b>would</b> have cost $42,380,000. In addition, $2,550,000 <b>would</b> be spent on a two-track subway an open-cut {{connection between}} the Rockaway Line and the Fulton Street Line. Only the portion south of Liberty Avenue was completed.|$|E

5|$|A crosstown line via Worth Street <b>would</b> {{serve as}} {{a branch of the}} IND Eighth Avenue Line's local tracks. The line <b>would</b> have {{branched}} off at Church Street, from where it <b>would</b> run via Worth Street and East Broadway to Lewis Street. This two-tracks segment <b>would</b> have cost $15,200,000. The line <b>would</b> then tunnel under the East River between Lewis Street to Driggs Avenue. This section <b>would</b> have cost $18,500,000. The South Fourth Street junction <b>would</b> be completed.|$|E
5|$|A four-track Second Avenue Subway <b>would</b> {{originate}} from {{a connection to}} the IRT Pelham Line at 138th Street, the Bronx, to Grand Street, Manhattan. The connection to the Pelham Line <b>would</b> allow for eight additional trains per hour operating between Manhattan and the Pelham Line. It <b>would</b> then be possible to operate 10-car trains via the line and it <b>would</b> also be possible to operate full express service via the line's center express track. The trains operating via Nassau Street <b>would</b> go to Brooklyn via the Montague Tunnel. During non-rush hours trains <b>would</b> terminate at Broad Street. There <b>would</b> be a passageway built from Grand Central via 43rd Street to Second Avenue to permit transfers.|$|E
5|$|A lack of {{sufficient}} transport aircraft meant that 1st Airborne Division <b>would</b> be dropped in three separate lifts over three successive days. 1st Parachute Brigade {{and most of}} 1st Airlanding Brigade <b>would</b> land on 17 September, 4th Parachute Brigade {{and the rest of}} 1st Airlanding Brigade <b>would</b> land on 18 September, and on 19 September the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade <b>would</b> land, along with a supplies for the entire division. The division <b>would</b> use approximately 650 gliders during the operation, of which 39 <b>would</b> be Hamilcars. It appears that the Hamilcars that had been used by 6th Airborne Division and subsequently abandoned in June had been replaced, as records state that 64 of the gliders were available by September. Thirteen Hamilcars <b>would</b> be flown on 17 September and land in landing zone 'Z'. Eight of the gliders <b>would</b> carry 17-pounder anti-tank guns, their towing vehicles and crews, and the other five <b>would</b> carry ten Universal Carriers, two apiece; the Carriers were to act as transports for the airborne troops. On 18 September fifteen Hamilcars <b>would</b> land in landing zone 'X'; eight <b>would</b> carry a 17-pounder anti-tank gun, their towing vehicles and crews each, and the other four <b>would</b> carry eight Universal Carriers, which <b>would</b> once again act as transport for the airborne troops that were flown in. The final three were packed with ammunition and stores, {{as well as a number}} of sappers from the Royal Engineers; these were experimental loads, as it was believed that the Hamilcar might be a more efficient way of transporting supplies rather than the Horsa due to its larger size. On 19 September, ten Hamilcars <b>would</b> transport American engineers who belonged to the American 878th Aviation Engineer Battalion and their equipment, which included bulldozers, cranes and graders; they were to construct a forward airfield in landing zone 'W' after the gliders had been cleared away.|$|E

5|$|A line {{running along}} Manhattan's West Side, {{stretching}} {{from the edge of}} the city at Yonkers to 14th Street. It <b>would</b> be a two-track line south to Dyckman Street, a three-track line to 162nd Street, and then-on it <b>would</b> be a four-track line. The line <b>would</b> have two southern branches that <b>would</b> diverge at 14th Street. A connection to the BMT Canarsie Line <b>would</b> use a pair of the tracks, while the other pair <b>would</b> go to Atlantic Avenue and Hicks Street in Brooklyn through an East River tunnel. Then it <b>would</b> turn down to Red Hook. There <b>would</b> also be a loop at Battery Park. Another branch <b>would</b> be built; it <b>would</b> consist of two tracks, and <b>would</b> go between 162nd Street and 190th Street via Amsterdam Avenue.|$|E
5|$|A line {{running from}} Hunters Point in Queens heading {{southeast}} to Lafayette Avenue in Brooklyn. The line <b>would</b> consist of {{between two and}} four tracks, and at Lafayette Avenue, the line <b>would</b> split. Two of them <b>would</b> continue as a Lafayette Avenue, but <b>would</b> then become four tracks. The remaining two tracks <b>would</b> run to Franklin and Flatbush Avenues.|$|E
5|$|A {{native of}} what <b>would</b> become the {{province}} of Ontario, May moved to Manitoba soon after completing education in his hometown. In Manitoba, he <b>would</b> take to briefly farming, before entering into the construction industry, which he <b>would</b> establish prominence in. After doing work for the railway, he <b>would</b> move to Winnipeg where he <b>would</b> join a contracting firm and {{become involved in the}} construction of many buildings. After moving west and living briefly in Carberry, Manitoba, May came to Edmonton in 1902.|$|E

5|$|A new 4-track {{trunk line}} along Lafayette Avenue in Brooklyn from Borough Hall to Bedford Avenue. The line <b>would</b> narrow to three tracks to Broadway. Then the line <b>would</b> have {{continued}} underneath the BMT Jamaica Line to 168th Street. By running underneath the Jamaica Line, the line <b>would</b> directly {{compete with the}} BMT. A two-track connection <b>would</b> also be provided to a First Avenue line.|$|E

5|$|A typical Nike-X {{deployment}} {{around a}} major city <b>would</b> have consisted of several missile batteries. One of these <b>would</b> be equipped with the MAR and its associated DCDP computers, while the others <b>would</b> optionally have an MSR. The sites were all networked together using communications equipment working at normal voice bandwidths. Some of the smaller bases <b>would</b> be built north of the MAR to provide protection to this central station.|$|E

5|$|After Applewhite's release, he {{traveled}} to California and Oregon with Nettles, eventually gaining a group of committed followers. Applewhite and Nettles told their followers that they <b>would</b> be visited by extraterrestrials who <b>would</b> provide them with new bodies. Applewhite initially stated {{that he and his}} followers <b>would</b> physically ascend to a spaceship, where their bodies <b>would</b> be transformed, but later, he came to believe that their bodies were the mere containers of their souls, which <b>would</b> later be placed into new bodies. These ideas were expressed with language drawn from Christian eschatology, the New Age movement, and American popular culture.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, if {{the density}} in the {{universe}} were equal to or below the critical density, the expansion <b>would</b> slow down but never stop. Star formation <b>would</b> cease with the consumption of interstellar gas in each galaxy; stars <b>would</b> burn out, leaving white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Very gradually, collisions between these <b>would</b> result in mass accumulating into larger and larger black holes. The average temperature of the universe <b>would</b> asymptotically approach absolute zero—a Big Freeze. Moreover, if the proton were unstable, then baryonic matter <b>would</b> disappear, leaving only radiation and black holes. Eventually, black holes <b>would</b> evaporate by emitting Hawking radiation. The entropy of the universe <b>would</b> increase {{to the point where}} no organized form of energy could be extracted from it, a scenario known as heat death.|$|E
5|$|An {{extension}} {{of a proposed}} Madison Avenue Line and the IND Sixth Avenue Line operating via 59th Street, with two branches. One branch <b>would</b> have operated along Second Avenue with a branch connecting to the IRT Pelham Line, which <b>would</b> {{have had to be}} modified to fit B Division subway cars, and a branch connecting to the IND Concourse Line. The other branch <b>would</b> have continued under the East River, and <b>would</b> have been connected to the Long Island Rail Road main line in the Sunnyside area. Subway trains <b>would</b> have continued via the Port Washington Branch to Little Neck, and via the LIRR Main Line to Rego Park, where it <b>would</b> have turned via the former Rockaway Beach Branch and then <b>would</b> have turned onto the Lower Montauk Branch, and <b>would</b> have continued on the branch through Jamaica, where it <b>would</b> continue via the Atlantic Branch until Rosedale, staying within city limits. The report claims that its proposed routes <b>would</b> serve up to twice as many people as the NYCTA's proposed routes.|$|E

60|$|Again, <b>Wouldest</b> thou {{have mercy}} for thy righteousness? For who <b>wouldest</b> thou have it; for another, or for thyself? If for another, {{and it is}} most proper, that a righteous man should intercede for another by his righteousness, rather than for himself, then thou thrusteth Christ out of his place and office, and makest thyself to be a saviour in his stead; for a {{mediator}} there is already, even a mediator between God and man, {{and he is the}} man Christ Jesus. There is therefore no need of thine interceding by thy righteousness for the acceptation of any unto justification from the curse.|$|R
5|$|An {{improved}} {{connection between}} the IRT Lexington Avenue Line and the IRT White Plains Road Line <b>would</b> be built using the tunnel under the Harlem River used by the IRT Pelham Line, and <b>would</b> allow for the full use of the capacity on the White Plains Road Line and the Jerome Avenue Line. Eight additional trains per hour <b>would</b> {{be added to the}} White Plains Road Line and fourteen additional trains per hour <b>would</b> be added to the Jerome Avenue Line. The additional service on the Jerome Avenue Line <b>would</b> make use of the third track for express service.|$|E
5|$|Article Seven of the {{proposed}} Constitution set the terms by which the new frame of government <b>would</b> be established.

5|$|As in {{the first}} attempt, a Sa'iqa company from the 103rd Battalion <b>would</b> occupy {{positions}} four kilometers east of Budapest to isolate the fort. It <b>would</b> be supported by an AT-3 Sagger ATGM platoon. The main attack <b>would</b> be launched from the east by a Sa'iqa company and a company from al-Mezahi's battalion as the first echelon. Other units of al-Mezahi's battalion <b>would</b> conduct a secondary attack from the west, while one company remained in reserve near Port Fouad along with a Sa'iqa company. A reinforced company (less one platoon) of al-Mezahi's battalion <b>would</b> land by sea directly upon the Israeli fort. The attack <b>would</b> be preceded by a 30-minute-long fire preparation.|$|E
