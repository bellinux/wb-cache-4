500|$|Around this time, Bubbles and Jackson were {{photographed by}} Kenny Rogers for his book, Your Friends and Mine. The photo shows Bubbles held on Jackson's hip, {{and has been}} cited {{as one of the}} best taken of Jackson. In the black and white photograph, Bubbles is dressed casually in a long sleeved shirt and overalls. Jackson is also dressed casually; he wears jeans and a simple shirt. Rogers said: [...] "Bubbles was so human it was almost frightening. He would take Christopher [...] by the hand, <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> refrigerator, open it, take out a banana and hand it to him. Christopher was amazed... we all were." ...|$|E
500|$|When Storm {{became a}} {{professional}} singer, {{he changed his}} name to Rory Storm by deed poll, and changed the name of his family's home in Broadgreen to Stormsville. Storm was known for the extravagant clothes he wore and the cars he drove, once buying a pink Vauxhall Cresta for £800 in cash. A young man was once caught by a porter at Bootle railway station writing [...] "I love Rory" [...] over the walls, and when questioned, {{it turned out to be}} Storm himself. The Hurricanes wore matching suits on stage, but Storm sometimes wore a pink suit and pink tie, and during concerts he would <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> piano and comb his blond hair with an oversized comb. Their stage wear changed from sunglasses and palm tree-decorated shirts to red (and blue) suits. Storm also wore an Elvis-style gold lamé suit. When they first appeared at Butlins holiday camp Storm wore a turquoise suit with a gold lamé shirt, while the group wore fluorescent suits.|$|E
500|$|NBC's {{preparations}} for the Sunday, November 17 game at Oakland were routine. The game was to be televised {{to most of the}} country beginning at 4:00p.m. Eastern Standard Time, with Curt Gowdy and Al DeRogatis announcing. NBC hoped that viewers who tuned their television channel selectors to the game would not <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> television and change the channel or turn off the power switch, but would watch the evening's programming. They anticipated a good game, which would cause the audience to remain in their seats and watch the game in its entirety, [...] "a perfect lead in for the network's special presentation of Heidi, the Johanna Spyri children's classic, which was scheduled to air after the game at 7p.m. (EST)". The television film was preempting Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color, the program normally shown by NBC on Sunday at that time. As the game started at 1:00p.m. Pacific Standard Time, the western half of the country would have to wait after the game for 7:00p.m. local time before seeing Heidi. Under television rules at the time, the Jets–Raiders game was blacked out within 90 miles of Oakland {{even though it was a}} sellout, leaving KRON-TV (channel 4, the local NBC affiliate serving Oakland at the time), and other NBC affiliates in nearby markets unable to show the game.|$|E
60|$|At this {{unexpected}} question Hilary <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fireplace.|$|R
60|$|He put {{his hands}} in his pockets and <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> window.|$|R
60|$|Then he <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{others and}} shook hands with Shaggy and Tik-Tok.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{he may be}} able to give us some information," [...] Louise asserted; [...] "so I propose we <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> town {{tomorrow}} morning and interview him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank {{you very}} much," [...] he replied, [...] "but I {{must be in}} my office this evening. I think I shall be obliged to borrow your gig. I will <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> field--" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{watched the}} foxy old captain <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Rube {{and talk to}} him while he rested, a reassuring hand on the pitcher's shoulder. The crowd yelled its disapproval and Umpire Bates called out sharply: ...|$|E
60|$|Instead of {{answering}} at once, Sam Rover <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door {{and closed it}} carefully.|$|R
60|$|The {{telephone}} extension bell rang. Nigel <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sideboard and {{took down the}} receiver.|$|R
60|$|For reply I <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> slatted {{window and}} began to whistle. My action only {{increased}} the merchant's anger.|$|R
6000|$|After {{a second}} pause she continued: [...] "What {{is it my}} duty and wisdom to do next? Not to stay here inactive, I am glad to say, but, of course, to <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Hollow." ...|$|E
60|$|Presently he {{returned}} to the station, and it was not long before the train could be seen approaching in the distance. Along with a number of others, Richard started to <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right track.|$|E
60|$|On the {{following}} Monday afternoon there was but little for Tom and Sam {{to do at}} the offices, and the former suggested to his younger brother that they <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> East Side and visit The Golden Oak House.|$|E
60|$|I was grievously puzzled at all this, and <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other tree, followed, as before, by Euphemia and Pomona.|$|R
60|$|Soon <b>the</b> train came <b>to</b> a halt, {{and they}} piled out, dress-suit cases in hand, and <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> automobile.|$|R
60|$|When he had finished, I {{paid him}} ten cents for his work, and <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> place he had mentioned.|$|R
6000|$|... "Guess I'll take a <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{newspaper}} {{office at}} once," [...] {{said the old}} tar, when the boy had finished. [...] "Reckon as how pop and the mistress can get along for a while. I suppose you'd like to come along." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You needn't trouble yourself, Phoebe," [...] she said; [...] "I will <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> barn. I would a {{great deal}} rather do that than wait in the house. If I don't see her there, I will come back and leave our cards." ...|$|E
60|$|Sam {{was bound}} with a rope, and then both prisoners {{were told to}} <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fire. This they did, and were left in charge of Husty and Jasper Grinder, while Baxter went off a distance, in company with big Bill Harney.|$|E
60|$|So old Granny Fox {{smoothed}} out her skirts and <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{foot of the}} tree where Ol' Mistah Buzzard sat.|$|R
6000|$|... "I--I merely <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> floral booth opposite, and {{exchanged}} {{a word with}} Miss Merrick, and the others there," [...] she explained.|$|R
6000|$|... "The fifth evening, after I had corralled my costly but uncongenial muttons, I <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ranch-house {{and stepped}} in the door.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I shan't {{want you}} at all, George. I {{told you so}} yesterday. However, after breakfast I will <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> farm with you. I only had time for a word with your father yesterday, but I told him that I would come over to see them {{sometime}} today." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now I'll {{show you}} how a commonplace bit of scenery {{can be made to}} look quite romantic," [...] said Mr. Jally presently. [...] "Let us <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{railroad}} embankment. Such an embankment is not pretty in itself, but I think we can get quite a pretty view of it." ...|$|E
60|$|The early dinner hour at Joe's, left me {{abundance}} of time, without hurrying my talk with Biddy, to <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> old spot before dark. But, what with loitering {{on the way}} to look at old objects and to think of old times, the day had quite declined when I came to the place.|$|E
6000|$|As Curtis <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> agency {{house with}} Sennett and his son, Jennie looked anxious. [...] "They may do {{something}} to him." ...|$|R
60|$|I <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> box, and at {{the window}} learned that the next train would not start for two hours and a half.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> Captain <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> window, {{and said}} nothing. He {{did not see}} the searching gray eyes of his old friend upon him.|$|R
60|$|Having {{written to}} Joe, {{to offer him}} consolation, and to assure him that I {{would come to the}} funeral, I passed the {{intermediate}} days in the curious state of mind I have glanced at. I went down early in the morning, and alighted at the Blue Boar in good time to <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> forge.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{looked as}} if you were ready to charge somebody. But this isn't a very nice place--to linger, and if you really will stay awhile," [...] said Victoria, [...] "we might <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dairy, where that model protege of yours, Eben Fitch, whom you once {{threatened}} with corporal chastisement if he fell from grace, is engaged. I know he will be glad to see you." ...|$|E
6000|$|This {{not being}} exactly the reply that Miss de Laine expected, she {{momentarily}} hesitated: but the duchess profited by it to <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> piano and introduce herself. When she rose to go she invited Helen to luncheon with her the next day. [...] "Come early, my dear, and we'll {{have a long}} talk." [...] Helen pointed out hesitatingly that she was practically a guest of the de Laines. [...] "Ah, well, that's true, my dear; then you may bring one of them with you." ...|$|E
60|$|When {{the door}} had closed behind her, he <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> window and looked out, {{drumming}} absently with his knuckles on the pane.|$|R
60|$|The {{next day}} Asaph was unusually brisk and active; and very soon after breakfast he <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> village tavern <b>to</b> see Mr. Rooper.|$|R
60|$|There was no {{help for}} it, {{and with an}} angry look on his face, Pepper left <b>the</b> {{gymnasium}} and <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> school building.|$|R
