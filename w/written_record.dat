5|$|Although {{this did}} not apply to the Subura slums, which were still as rickety and fire-prone as ever, he did leave a mark on the monumental {{topography}} of the centre and of the Campus Martius, with the Ara Pacis (Altar of Peace) and monumental sundial, whose central gnomon was an obelisk taken from Egypt. The relief sculptures decorating the Ara Pacis visually augmented the <b>written</b> <b>record</b> of Augustus' triumphs in the Res Gestae. Its reliefs depicted the imperial pageants of the praetorians, the Vestals, and the citizenry of Rome.|$|E

5|$|It is {{also from}} the Neolithic, in about 3000 BC, that we glimpse the first known {{illustrations}} of plants and read descriptions of impressive gardens in Egypt. However protobotany, the first pre-scientific <b>written</b> <b>record</b> of plants, did not begin with food; it {{was born out of}} the medicinal literature of Egypt, China, Mesopotamia and India. Botanical historian Alan Morton notes that agriculture was the occupation of the poor and uneducated, while medicine was the realm of socially influential shamans, priests, apothecaries, magicians and physicians, who were more likely to record their knowledge for posterity.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{was given}} a {{permanent}} commission by the RAF after the war (initially as a squadron leader, although retaining his wartime substantive rank as wing commander, and later confirmed in that rank), becoming OC Tactics at the Central Fighter Establishment.

Johnson did not leave any <b>written</b> <b>record</b> of his experiences in the Korean War. It is believed he saw action against enemy aircraft. For his service he received the Air Medal and Legion of Merit from the United States.|$|E
5|$|Kraków's {{early history}} begins with {{evidence}} of a Stone Age settlement on the present site of the Wawel Hill. A legend attributes Kraków's founding to the mythical ruler Krakus, who built it above a cave occupied by a dragon, Smok Wawelski. The first <b>written</b> <b>record</b> of the city's name dates back to 965, when Kraków {{was described as a}} notable commercial centre controlled first by Moravia (876–879), but captured by a Bohemian duke Boleslaus I in 955. The first acclaimed ruler of Poland, Mieszko I, took Kraków from the Bohemians and incorporated it into the holdings of the Piast dynasty towards the end of his reign.|$|E

5|$|Tea: The tea {{plant is}} {{indigenous}} to western Yunnan; {{by the mid}} 2nd millennium BC, tea was being consumed in Yunnan for medicinal purposes. Tea drinking was already an established custom in the daily life in this area {{as shown by the}} Contract with a Slave, written by Wang Bao in 59 BC. This <b>written</b> <b>record</b> also reveals that tea was processed and used as a drink instead of a medicinal herb, emerged no later than the 1st century BC. Early Chinese tea culture began from the time of Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) to the Southern and Northern Dynasties (420–589) when tea was widely used by Chinese gentry, but only took its initial shape during the Tang Dynasty (618–907).|$|E
5|$|The barn {{which was}} {{originally}} known as Parson's Barn, {{was built on}} the orders of the Abott of Glastonbury Abbey in the late 14th or early 15th century. There is no <b>written</b> <b>record</b> of the exact date and there is some debate about the likely age of the building based on the architectural features. Along with several others barns it was used to collect the tithes or dues to the abbey, often one tenth of a farm's produce. It fell within the hundred of Glaston Twelve Hides which was named after the hides who gave food rent to Glastonbury Abbey. The West Pennart Court Barn is the smallest of those which survive.|$|E
5|$|The cult of Saint Andrew {{may have}} come to Pictland from Northumbria, as had the cult of Saint Peter which had been favoured by Nechtan, and in {{particular}} from the monastery at Hexham which was dedicated to Saint Andrew.

5|$|The {{earliest}} <b>written</b> <b>record</b> of Crewkerne {{is in the}} 899 will of Alfred the Great {{who left}} it to his youngest son Aethelweard. After the Norman conquest it was held by William the Conqueror and in the Domesday Survey of 1086 {{was described as a}} royal manor. Crewkerne Castle was possibly a Norman motte castle. The town grew up in the late mediaeval period around the textile industry, its wealth preserved in the fifteenth century Church of St Bartholomew. During the 18th and 19th centuries the main industry was cloth making, including webbing, and sails for the Royal Navy.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} <b>written</b> <b>record</b> of the dovecote was in 1393 {{although the}} exact {{date of construction}} is not known. It was attached to a mansion house which burnt down in 1875. The manor previously belonged to Montacute Priory, a Cluniac priory of the Benedictine order, founded between 1078 and 1102 {{although it is not}} known if the construction of the dovecote was undertaken by the priory or the Lovel family who later held the manor. Pigeons and doves were an important food source historically kept for their eggs, flesh (squab), and dung.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} tRound House in Main Street is disputed. It has been claimed {{that it is}} a late 15th-century dovecote. A Sun firemark {{insurance}} policy still exists, number 616606, dated July 1793, the earliest known <b>written</b> <b>record</b> of the house. Other sources suggest the Round House is an 18th-century thatched cottage, similar to the South African rondavel. A further source claims the building is a post-medieval, AD 1540–1900, tower mill. A family of 13children lived in the building during the 19th century. The now private dwelling was re-thatched in 2009.|$|E

5|$|The {{insurers}} {{applied to}} the Earl of Mansfield to have the previous verdict set aside and for the case to be tried again. A hearing {{was held at the}} Court of King's Bench in Westminster Hall from 21–22 May 1783, before Mansfield and two other King's Bench judges, Mr Justice Buller and Mr Justice Willes. The Solicitor General, John Lee, appeared on behalf of the Zong owners, as he had done previously in the Guildhall trial. Granville Sharp was also in attendance, together with a secretary he had hired to take a <b>written</b> <b>record</b> of the proceedings.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{evidence}} of any direct Norwegian rule in the area other than a few brief occupations although the <b>written</b> <b>record</b> is weak and no contemporary records of the Norse period from the Outer Hebrides exist. It is however known that Hebrides were taxed using the Ounceland system and evidence from Bornais suggests that settlers there may have been more prosperous than families of a similar status in the Northern Isles, possibly due to a more relaxed political regime. Latterly, the Hebrides sent eight representatives from Lewis and Harris and Skye and another eight from the southern Hebrides to the Tynwald parliament on Man.|$|E
5|$|Threefold {{repetition}} of position: This most commonly occurs when neither side {{is able to}} avoid repeating moves without incurring a disadvantage.

The three occurrences of the position need not occur on consecutive moves for a claim to be valid. FIDE rules make no mention of perpetual check; this is merely {{a specific type of}} draw by threefold repetition.|$|E

5|$|Unlike most of {{the larger}} Orkney islands, the {{derivation}} of the name 'Shapinsay' is not obvious. The final 'ay' is from the Old Norse for island, but the first two syllables {{are more difficult to}} interpret. Haswell-Smith (2004) suggests the root may be hjalpandis-øy (helpful island) owing to the presence of a good harbour, although anchorages are plentiful in the archipelago. The first <b>written</b> <b>record</b> dates from 1375 in a reference to Scalpandisay, which may suggest a derivation from Judge's island. Another suggestion is Hyalpandi's island, although no one of that name is known to be associated with Shapinsay.|$|E
5|$|Chadderton is not {{recorded}} in the Domesday Book of1086. Its first appearance in a <b>written</b> <b>record</b> is in a legal document from around1220, which states that Robert, Rector of Prestwich, gave land to Richard, son of Gilbert, in exchange for an annual fee of one silver penny. Following the Norman conquest, Chadderton was made a constituent manor of the wider Royal Estate of Tottington, an extensive fee held by the Norman overlord, Roger de Montbegon. Taxation and governance continued on this basis throughout the Middle Ages, with the Barons Montbegon of Hornby Castle holding the estate, until it passed to the Barons Lacy of Clitheroe Castle, and then onto local families. In about1235, the sub-manor of Chadderton and Foxdenton passed from Richard de Trafford of Trafford Park to Geoffrey de Trafford, who adopted the surname of Chadderton, thus founding the Chadderton family. During the High Middle Ages, pieces of land in Chadderton were granted to religious orders and institutions, including Cockersand Abbey and the Knights Hospitaller.|$|E
5|$|Reading may {{date back}} to the Roman {{occupation}} of Britain, possibly as a trading port for Calleva Atrebatum. However, the first clear evidence for Reading as a settlement dates from the 8th century, when the town {{came to be known as}} Readingum. The name probably comes from the Readingas, an Anglo-Saxon tribe whose name means Reada's People in Old English, or less probably the Celtic Rhydd-Inge, meaning Ford over the River. In late 870, an army of Danes invaded the kingdom of Wessex and set up camp at Reading. On 4 January 871, in the first Battle of Reading, King Ethelred and his brother Alfred the Great attempted unsuccessfully to breach the Danes' defences. The battle is described in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, and that account provides the earliest known <b>written</b> <b>record</b> of the existence of Reading. The Danes remained in Reading until late in 871, when they retreated to their winter quarters in London.|$|E
