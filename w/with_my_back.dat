500|$|A {{pioneer of}} rock and roll, Berry was a {{significant}} influence {{on the development of}} both the music and the attitude associated with the rock music lifestyle. With songs such as [...] "Maybellene" [...] (1955), [...] "Roll Over Beethoven" [...] (1956), [...] "Rock and Roll Music" [...] (1957) and [...] "Johnny B. Goode" [...] (1958), Berry refined and developed rhythm and blues into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive, with lyrics successfully aimed to appeal to the early teenage market by using graphic and humorous descriptions of teen dances, fast cars, high school life, and consumer culture, and utilizing guitar solos and showmanship that would be a major influence on subsequent rock music. [...] Thus Berry, the songwriter, invented rock as [...] "a music of teenage wishes fulfilled and good times (even with cops in pursuit)." [...] Berry contributed three things to rock music: an irresistible swagger, a focus on the guitar riff as the primary melodic element and an emphasis on songwriting as storytelling. His records are a rich storehouse of the essential lyrical, showmanship and musical components {{of rock and}} roll. In addition to the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, a large number of significant popular-music performers have recorded Berry's songs. Though not technically accomplished, his guitar style is distinctive—he incorporated electronic effects to mimic the sound of bottleneck blues guitarists and drew on the influence of guitar players such as Carl Hogan, and T-Bone Walker to produce a clear and exciting sound that many later guitarists would acknowledge as an influence in their own style. Berry's showmanship has been influential on other rock guitarists, particularly his one-legged hop routine, and the [...] "duck walk", which he first used as a child when he walked [...] "stooping with full-bended knees, but <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>back</b> and head vertical" [...] under a table to retrieve a ball and his family found it entertaining; he used it when [...] "performing in New York {{for the first time and}} some journalist branded it the duck walk." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{idea behind}} the Scratch <b>My</b> <b>Back</b> project is a song {{exchange}} where each artist would cover one of Gabriel's songs in return for his covering one of theirs; the other artists' renditions of Gabriel's songs were to appear on an album entitled I'll Scratch Yours. Initially planned to be released simultaneously <b>with</b> Scratch <b>My</b> <b>Back</b> in 2010, several artists were late in delivering their songs or ultimately declined to participate, necessitating changes to the companion album's concept. With several new artists aboard, the slightly retitled And I'll Scratch Yours was released in September 2013.|$|R
60|$|Before {{going to}} bed that night I did not throw myself into an easy-chair and gaze musingly out into the night. On the contrary, I stood up sturdily <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>back</b> to the mantel-piece, and with the {{forefinger}} of my right hand I tapped my left palm.|$|E
60|$|To all this, {{as may be}} well supposed, I made no answer. They had set me <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>back</b> {{against the}} wall, and I stood there, looking Silver in the face, pluckily enough, I hope, to all outward appearance, but with black despair in my heart.|$|E
