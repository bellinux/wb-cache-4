500|$|The {{popularity}} of chips and dip significantly {{increased in the}} United States during the 1950s, beginning circa 1954, due to changes in styles of entertaining in the suburbs and also due to a Lipton advertising campaign based upon using Lipton's instant dehydrated onion soup mix to prepare dip.

500|$|In Poland and Ukraine, borscht {{is usually}} {{one of the}} dishes served at a Christmas Eve dinner. Celebrated after the first star has {{appeared}} in the sky on December 24 (Roman Catholic) or January 6 (Greek Catholic), it is a meal which {{is at the same time}} festive and fasting, a multicourse affair (traditionally, with twelve distinct dishes) that excludes ingredients of land-animal origin. Christmas Eve borscht is, therefore, either vegetarian or based on fish stock and is not typically mixed <b>with</b> <b>sour</b> <b>cream.</b> In Ukraine, the soup contains vegetables that are sautéed in vegetable oil rather than lard, as well as beans and mushrooms. It may be also thickened with wheat flour dry-roasted in a pan instead of the usual roux. The Polish version of Christmas Eve borscht is a clear ruby-red broth.

500|$|Ashkenazi Jews {{living in}} Eastern Europe adopted {{beetroot}} borscht from their Slavic neighbors and adapted {{it to their}} taste and religious requirements. As combining meat with milk is proscribed by kosher dietary laws, Jews have developed two variants of the soup: meat (...) and dairy (...) [...] The meat variant is typically made from beef brisket (pork is never used) and cabbage, while the dairy one is vegetarian, blended <b>with</b> <b>sour</b> <b>cream</b> or a mixture of milk and egg yolks. Both variants typically contain beetroots and onions, and are flavored with beet sour, vinegar or citric acid for tartness and beet sugar for sweetness. Galician Jews traditionally liked their borscht particularly sweet. Jewish borscht may be served either hot or cold, typically with a hot boiled potato on the side. In prewar Eastern Europe it was traditionally put up to ferment around Purim {{so that it would}} be ready four weeks later for the Passover holiday.|$|E
500|$|As well as {{the thick}} borschts {{described}} above, Polish cuisine offers a ruby-colored beetroot bouillon known as , or clear red borscht. It is made by combining strained meat-and-vegetable stock with wild mushroom broth and beet sour. In some versions, smoked meat {{may be used for}} the stock and the tartness may be obtained or enhanced by adding lemon juice, dill pickle brine, or dry red wine. It may be served either in a soup bowl or – especially at dinner parties – as a hot beverage in a twin-handled cup, with a croquette or a filled pastry on the side. Unlike other types of borscht, it is not whitened <b>with</b> <b>sour</b> <b>cream.</b> , or Christmas Eve borscht, is a variant of the clear borscht that is traditionally served during the Polish Christmas Eve supper. In this version, meat stock is either omitted or replaced with fish broth, usually made by boiling the heads cut off from fish used in other Christmas Eve dishes. The mushrooms used for cooking the mushroom broth are reserved for [...] (small filled dumplings), which are then served with the borscht.|$|E

500|$|In the 1930s, {{when most}} American hotels {{refused to accept}} Jewish guests due to {{widespread}} anti-Semitism, New York Jews began flocking to Jewish-owned resorts in the Catskill Mountains for their summer vacations. The area grew into a major center of Jewish entertainment, with restaurants offering all-you-can-eat Ashkenazi Jewish fare, including copious amounts of borscht. Grossinger's, {{one of the largest}} resorts, served borscht throughout the day, every day of the year. The region became known, initially in derision, as the [...] "Borscht Belt", reinforcing the popular association between borscht and American Jewish culture.
