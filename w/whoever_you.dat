[...] "It was in the late '70s at the Indochina Friendship Booth at the annual Fourth of July streetfair in Eureka, California," [...] she said. [...] "I got a fortune cookie that said 'Art is your fate, don't debate.' That next January, I was enrolled in an art school in San Francisco." [...] She began frequenting the Mabuhay Gardens, a popular nightclub, to see local alternative rock groups like The Nuns, the Mutants, Crime, and the Avengers. She also formed the Mummers and Poppers, a punk parody band that covered 1960s tunes with guitarist Peter Woods, Charles Hagan and drummer Jay Derrah, [...] Iyall was originally hesitant to perform because she was overweight: [...] "After seeing Patti Smith, I still had it {{in my mind that}} you had to be skinny to be up there , but after going to the Mabuhay [...] you just do whatever you want, be <b>whoever</b> <b>you</b> want, just make it happen." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dare {{was almost}} universally {{critically}} acclaimed in the UK, and featured {{strongly in the}} year end polls for 1981. In Melody Maker Steve Sutherland celebrated the fact the album would irritate the guitar-rock traditionalists, saying, [...] "All let's-pretend-pompous it's cornily consistent, cultured, crude, elegant, cheap... anything {{you want it to}} be. Me? I think it's a masterpiece. Sure to upset some, sell to millions more and so it should the way it tramps all over rock traditions. A trite sound, a retarded glam image and a mock respect. All the appeal in the world... Dare should show up the pathetic farce of pop mythology once and for all." [...] Smash Hits critic David Hepworth called it [...] "chock-full of precise, memorable melodies delivered with style and humour". Noted music critic Paul Morley wrote in the NME, [...] "Dare is the second intoxicating intervention to be produced out of the great split , and already it's the first Human League greatest hits collection... Much more than ABBA or <b>whoever</b> <b>you</b> like, The Human League signify that deliciously serious, sincerely disposable MOR music can possess style, quality and sophistication... I think that Dare is one of the GREAT popular music LPs." ...|$|E
2500|$|Describing {{the show}} as {{simultaneously}} [...] "spellbinding, exhausting to watch and hugely slick" [...] and calling Knowles [...] "the planet's greatest superstar", Michael Cragg of musicOMH noted that the highlights included songs from the Sasha Fierce disc of the album. Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone magazine praised the show, saying, [...] "She worked, and worked it relentlessly, never missing a note, a beat of choreography, or a chance to strike a pose, hold it, and be adored." [...] Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News, commented [...] "Through six outfit changes, bombastic ballads, high-energy singles and a daring high-wire journey from the stage {{to the center of}} the arena, Beyoncé delivered over and over again." [...] A writer of Billboard magazine noted that Knowles [...] "brought all the fierceness" [...] on stage for the tour. The Australians Patrick Emery noted that Knowles showcased her self-assurance and professionalism in [...] "full view" [...] further praising the [...] "carefully" [...] choreographed show. Comparing her performance with Michael Jackson's, Renee Michelle Harris of the South Florida Times writes, [...] " [...] owns the stage with her trademark swagger and intensity... showcasing her powerful vocals without missing a note, often while engaged in vigorous, perfectly executed dance moves...no one, not Britney, not Ciara and not Rihanna can offer what she does—a complete package of voice, moves and presence." [...] Tamara Hardingham-Gill of the Daily Mail awarded the performance five out of five stars and noted that Knowles' vocal abilities were showcased during the ballads of the show where she was [...] "note perfect throughout". She concluded her review by saying that although it was [...] "too early" [...] to compare Knowles with Michael Jackson, [...] "she certainly proved that she is one of the most exciting and talented performers around and may well go down in history as such." [...] Comparing her with Diana Ross and Tina Turner, Holly Burnes of The Daily Telegraph noted that Knowles proved she was the [...] "world's best female performed" [...] with her performance and added, [...] "Whether crumping, sweeping across the stage in towering heels, or simply standing still, Beyonce was dynamite, blasting the benchmark for concert performers forever... Good luck trying to follow that act <b>whoever</b> <b>you</b> are." [...] Simon Colling from The West Australian described the performance as [...] "powerhouse" [...] and added, [...] "Beyonce's high-energy, high-voltage mix of song (loud, commercial R) and dance recalled names like Tina Turner, Aretha Franklin and rapper Missy Elliott. Sometimes her booming vocals were so over the top she seemed to have come down with a case of Mariah Carey syndrome." [...] Writing that there were [...] "ska, reggae, girlish pop, jazz, rap, soul, gospel, Middle Eastern, rock and body-thumping club remixes", Joanna Horowitz of The Seattle Times added, [...] "The only thing is, while she can wrap her voice and body around just about any style, she doesn't really have her own signature, at least musically. And while all the variety kept the concert interesting, it came off a little unfocused... But for a show that's as much about style as music, you gotta hand it to Beyoncé. The evening played out like a hip-hop Cirque du Soleil — sequins galore, dramatic dance numbers, and Beyoncé at one point soaring". The Observers Barbara Ellen wrote, [...] "she is a performer who can shape-change at will. Whether charismatic and soulful, or teasing and flirty, Beyoncé is, above all, in charge. Probably the most 'in charge' of any female artist I've seen onstage... she is a force of nature – delivering one of the most enjoyable well-paced shows I've seen in years." [...] However, she noted that Knowles is [...] "so steeped in professionalism that what should be magical can become mechanical."
