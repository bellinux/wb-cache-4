40|$|This {{research}} work, for {{the first}} time, investigated metal semiconductor-metal (MSM) zine oxide (ZnO) nanorod based ultra-violet (UV) detectors having a <b>Wheatstone</b> <b>bridge</b> design with a high responsivity at room temperature and above, {{as well as a}} responsivity that was largely independent of the change in ambient conditions. The ZnO nanorods which acted as the sensing element of the detector were grown by a chemical growth technique. Studies were conducted to determine the effects on ZnO nanorod properties by varying the concentration of the chemicals used for the rod growth. These studies showed how the rod diameter and the deposition of ZnO nanorods from the solution was controlled by varying the concentration of the chemicals used for the rod growth. Conventional MSM UV detectors were fabricated with ZnO nanorods grown under optimized conditions to determine the dependence of UV response on electrode dimension and rod dimension. These studies gave insights into the dependence of UV response on the width of the electrode, spacing between the electrodes, density of the rod growth, and length and diameter of the rods. The UV responsivity was affected by varying the number of times the seed layer was spin coated, by varying the spin speed of seed layer coating and by varying the annealing temperature of the seed and rod. Based on these studies, optimum conditions for the fabrication of <b>Wheatstone</b> <b>bridge</b> UV ZnO nanorod detectors were determined. The <b>Wheatstone</b> <b>bridge</b> ZnO nanorod UV detectors were fabricated in three different configurations, namely, symmetric, asymmetric, and quasi-symmetric. The transient responses of the symmetric, asymmetric and quasi-symmetric configurations at room temperature and above showed how the response stability differed. At high temperature the responsivity of quasi-symmetric <b>Wheatstone</b> <b>bridge</b> detector configuration did not drop after saturation and the responsivity drifted by 17 % to 25 % from the room temperature response. The responsivity of quasisymmetric <b>Wheatstone</b> <b>bridge</b> configuration with good temperature stability was 1. 16 A/W, while those of conventional MSM UV detectors were approximately 60 A/W. However, the quasi-symmetric <b>Wheatstone</b> <b>bridge</b> with responsivity 1. 16 A/W was higher than the commercially available detector having responsivity of only about 0. 1 A/W. Though the response of quasi-symmetric <b>Wheatstone</b> <b>bridge</b> detector was higher than the detectors available commercially, the response time was very high. The response time of quasi-symmetric <b>Wheatstone</b> <b>bridge</b> was approximately 159 seconds at room temperature, while that of commercially available detectors is of the order of microseconds. If the quasi-symmetric <b>Wheatstone</b> <b>bridge</b> has to compete with current commercially available detectors, then the response time should be brought down from seconds to microseconds. Based on these studies, an improved design of the quasi-symmetric <b>Wheatstone</b> <b>bridge</b> UV detector with the ZnO rods oriented parallel to the substrate instead of oriented vertical to the substrate was proposed...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{performance}} of a magnetorheological (MR) hydraulic power system is analytically and experimentally assessed. Four MR valves are implemented as a <b>Wheatstone</b> <b>bridge</b> hydraulic power circuit to drive a hydraulic actuator using a gear pump. The compact hydraulic power actuation system is a <b>Wheatstone</b> <b>bridge</b> network driving a conventional hydraulic actuator. A key advantage of using MR valves in hydraulic actuation systems is that the valves have no moving parts. This reduces complexity and enhances durability compared to conventional mechanical valves. In such a system, an MR fluid is used as the hydraulic fluid. A constant volume pump is used to pressurize the MR fluid. If a change in direction is required, the flow through each of the valves in the <b>Wheatstone</b> <b>bridge</b> can be controlled smoothly via changing the applied magnetic field. A magnetic field analysis is conducted to design a high-efficiency compact MR valve. The behavior and {{performance of}} the MR valve is {{expressed in terms of}} nondimensional parameters. The performance of the hydraulic actuator system with a <b>Wheatstone</b> <b>bridge</b> network of MR valves is derived using three different constitutive models of the MR fluid: an idealized model (infinite yield stress), a Bingham plastic model, and a biviscous model. The analytical system efficiency in each case is compared to experiment, and departures from ideal behavior, that is, a valve with infinite blocking pressure, are recognized.
