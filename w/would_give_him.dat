5|$|In March 1915, Ball began a {{short-lived}} engagement to Dot Allbourne (or Ellbourne), {{though he was}} still interested in other girls such as Thelma Starr. In June, {{he decided to take}} private flying lessons at Hendon Aerodrome, which <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> an outlet for his interest in engineering and possibly help him to see action in France sooner. He paid to undertake pilot training in his own time at the Ruffy-Baumann School, which charged £75 to £100 for instruction (£5,580 to £7,440 in 2010 prices).|$|E
5|$|On October3, it was {{reported}} that he was retained by Boston under the reserve clause. When interviewed during the off-season, Stivetts claimed {{that he would like to}} quit pitching and play first, that is if a team <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> the opportunity. Selee, Boston's manager, disagreed and claimed that the team needed Stivetts in the pitching rotation instead. It was also likely that he would have received less salary playing at first.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} generals' plot, Đính sent Colonel Nguyễn Hữu Có, {{his deputy}} corps commander, to Mỹ Tho {{to talk to the}} 7th Division commander, Colonel Bùi Đình Đạm, and two regimental commanders, the {{armoured}} unit commander, both subordinate to Đạm, and the chief of Mỹ Tho province. Exhorting them to join the coup, he stated that all the generals were in the plot except the strongly loyalist Huỳnh Văn Cao, and that Đính would soon join. According to one account, Đính had intended that loyalists would report Có's activities to Diệm and Nhu so that it <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> an opportunity to orchestrate a stunt to ingratiate himself with the palace.|$|E

5|$|By 1889 Verdi {{had been}} an opera {{composer}} for more than fifty years. He had written 27 operas, of which only one was a comedy, his second work, Un giorno di regno, staged unsuccessfully in 1840. His fellow composer Rossini commented that he admired Verdi greatly, but thought him incapable of writing a comedy. Verdi disagreed {{and said that he}} longed to write another light-hearted opera, but nobody <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> the chance. He had included moments of comedy even in his tragic operas, for example in Un ballo in maschera and La forza del destino.|$|E
5|$|During {{his term}} as praetor in the Iberian Peninsula (modern Portugal and Spain), Pompey's {{contemporary}} Julius Caesar defeated two local tribes in battle. After his term as consul in 59 BC, {{he was appointed}} to a five-year term as the proconsular Governor of Cisalpine Gaul (part of current northern Italy), Transalpine Gaul (current southern France) and Illyria (part of the modern Balkans). Not content with an idle governorship, Caesar strove to find reason to invade Gaul (modern France and Belgium), which <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> the dramatic military success he sought. When two local tribes began to migrate on a route that would take them near (not into) the Roman province of Transalpine Gaul, Caesar had the barely sufficient excuse he needed for his Gallic Wars, fought between 58 BC and 49 BC.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the events}} of InFamous, Cole (Eric Ladin) and his friend Zeke (Caleb Moody) meet with NSA agent Lucy Kuo (Dawn Olivieri), who informs them that Dr. Sebastian Wolfe (Michael Ensign), the man {{responsible}} for creating the Ray Sphere that gave Cole his powers, has developed an even stronger version that <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> enough strength to stop the Beast. Before they can depart for Wolfe's lab in New Marais, the Beast attacks Empire City. Cole tries to fight him off, but even his most powerful attack proves useless. The group is subsequently forced to flee as Empire City is completely and utterly destroyed.|$|E
60|$|But George Bertram {{was not one}} of them: he {{had been}} in no hurry to condemn his father; but, having seen his sins, he knew them for sins, and did condemn them. He found that his uncle had been right, and that Sir Lionel was a man whom he could in no wise respect, and could hardly love. Money he {{perceived}} was his father's desire. He <b>would</b> therefore <b>give</b> <b>him</b> what money he could spare; but he <b>would</b> not <b>give</b> <b>him</b> his society.|$|R

5|$|In 1962, two-time former {{governor}} and Democratic factional leader Happy Chandler {{had already begun}} his campaign for a third term as governor. The anti-Chandler faction became concerned that, {{if they did not}} name a candidate, Chandler's early announcement <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> an advantage in the 1963 election. Leaders of the faction were solidly behind state Highway Commissioner Henry Ward, but Governor Combs was leaning toward Breathitt. Breathitt announced his candidacy on May 2, 1962, but many in his party remained skeptical due to his youth and relative inexperience. Combs eventually convinced the anti-Chandler faction to back Breathitt, and Ward never became a candidate.|$|E
5|$|It was John's {{hope that}} the Pope <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> {{valuable}} legal and moral support, and accordingly John played for time; the King had declared {{himself to be a}} papal vassal in 1213 and correctly believed he could count on the Pope for help. John also began recruiting mercenary forces from France, although some were later sent back to avoid giving the impression that the King was escalating the conflict. In a further move to shore up his support, John took an oath to become a crusader, a move which gave him additional political protection under church law, even though many felt the promise was insincere.|$|E
5|$|Miller's {{uncertain}} future continued to dog him, and Rawtenstall expressed their displeasure at their recruit's apparent refusal to fulfil his contract. Miller had privately {{decided that he}} would not go through with the deal, but was refusing to inform the Lancastrian club. In the meantime, he had various job proposals, which he spurned until privately receiving a contract offer from the manager of North Sydney Cricket Club. The proposed deal <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> a subsidy for the costs of his relocation to Sydney to work as a liquor salesman, and gave him generous leave conditions so that he could play sport.|$|E

5|$|As marine {{creatures that}} reside {{in either the}} depths or the poles, humans {{knew very little about}} whales over the course of history; many feared or revered them. The Nords and various arctic tribes revered the whale as they were {{important}} pieces of their lives. In Inuit creation myths, when 'Big Raven', a deity in human form, found a stranded whale, he was told by the Great Spirit where to find special mushrooms that <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> the strength to drag the whale back to the sea and thus, return order to the world. In an Icelandic legend, a man threw a stone at a fin whale and hit the blowhole, causing the whale to burst. The man was told not to go to sea for twenty years, but during the nineteenth year he went fishing and a whale came and killed him.|$|E
5|$|From 1808, {{a number}} of detractors argued that the {{navigation}} was in a poor condition, hoping to force Hollis to concede water rights to mills, and traffic declined. Another Act of 1811 allowed Hollis to raise the tolls, and eight years later, he held {{a meeting at the}} Winchester Guildhall, explaining why he needed to raise the tolls further. The meeting asked him to postpone his next Bill for a year, in return for which they <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> £1,200 for one year's tolls, wharfage and rent, he would spend £600 on repairs, and the remaining £600 would amount to 5 per cent interest on the estimated value of the navigation, which was then £12,000. He obtained his Act of Parliament a year later, which raised the tolls, but the Commissioners reduced freight charges at the same time, resulting in the operation being more profitable for Hollis and less so for the barge owners.|$|E
5|$|He {{was offered}} the job as manager of Second Division club Middlesbrough on his 38th {{birthday}} in 1973. He {{declined to be interviewed}} for the position, and instead handed the club a list of responsibilities he expected to take, which if agreed to <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> total control of the running of the club. He refused a contract, and would never sign a contract throughout his managerial career. He took a salary of £10,000 a year despite the chairman being willing to pay a lot more; his only stipulations were a gentleman's agreement that he would not be sacked, assurances that he would have no interference from the board in team affairs, and three days off a week for fishing and shooting. He decided to first repaint Ayresome Park and to publicise the upcoming league campaign so as to generate higher attendance figures.|$|E

5|$|Houston {{began to}} rebuild, {{bringing}} in young guards Cuttino Mobley and 2000 NBA co-Rookie of the Year Steve Francis. On August 2, 2001, after refusing a $13 million {{deal with the}} Rockets, Olajuwon {{was traded to the}} Toronto Raptors for draft picks (the highest of which was used by Houston to draft Boštjan Nachbar at #15 in the 2002 NBA draft), with the player having a three-year contract that <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> $18 million. Olajuwon averaged career lows of 7.1 points and 6.0 rebounds per game in what would be his final season in the NBA, as he decided to retire in the fall of 2002, due to a back injury. Olajuwon retired as the all–time league leader in total blocked shots with 3,830, although shot blocking did not become an official statistic until the 1973–74 NBA season. Shortly after his retirement, his #34 jersey was retired by the Rockets.|$|E
5|$|Kalākaua's Masonic ties as Master of Lodge Le Progres de L'Oceanie <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> {{a global}} brotherhood in his travels. He and his chosen companions boarded the {{steamship}} City of Sydney at 6:30a.m., January 20, bound for San Francisco. As the King {{made his way}} onto the ship, many in {{the crowd at the}} dock reached out to touch him. Major George W. Macfarlane, his aide-de-camp, would accompany them as far as California. The King traveled as Aliʻi Kalākaua and as Prince Kalākaua, rather than in his capacity as head of state. The intent was to give the impression of a personal vacation, thereby avoiding the large costly retinue required for official business. The Royal Hawaiian Band, the Hawaiian army, and a large contingent of well-wishers bid them farewell as the City of Sydney sailed out.|$|E
5|$|Later on {{the evening}} of 7 August, she asked Bamber whether he had done it. He said no, but that a friend of his had, whom he named; the man was a plumber the family had used in the past. Bamber {{allegedly}} said he had told this friend how he could enter and leave the farmhouse undetected, and that one of his instructions had been for the friend to telephone him from the farm on one of the phones in the house that had a memory redial facility, so that if the police checked it, it <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> an alibi. Everything had gone as planned, he said, except that Nevill had put up a fight, and the friend had become angry and shot him seven times. The friend had allegedly told Sheila to lie down and shoot herself last, Bamber said. The friend then placed the Bible on her chest so she appeared to have killed herself in a religious frenzy. The children were shot in their sleep, he said. Mugford said Bamber claimed to have paid the friend £2,000.|$|E

5|$|As 1989 wore on, Prost {{continually}} {{claimed his}} Honda V10s were not producing {{the same amount}} of power as those in Senna's car. It actually {{got to the point where}} Honda F1 boss Osamu Goto felt compelled to speak to the specialist British media on the matter. He claimed that Senna's foot-tapping style with the accelerator helped keep the RA109-E's revs up in the engine's mid-range where most of the power was, while Prost's smoother style dropped the engines into low revs where they had a pick-up problem. Apparently the talk was convincing until most of those present noticed Goto continually called them Ayrton and Prost respectively (per Japanese customs, addressing a person by their first name rather than the surname shows a much higher degree of familiarity and confidentiality). An example of Prost's claims came during the Mexican Grand Prix. Despite his car running less wing than Senna's which theoretically <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> greater top speed, Prost's McLaren was not able to pass Senna's on the long front straight even though he came of the final Peraltada Curve clearly faster than the Brazilian and also had the benefit of a tow. In stark contrast, late in the race when Senna was lapping Prost (who was on fresh tyres), Senna was easily able to power past Prost on the straight.|$|E
5|$|Hartley {{explained}} that Arthur would {{be aware of}} his powers {{at the beginning of}} the series and would have no problem using them for personal gain. Hartley felt this played against the typical superheroes, because his character was not afraid to flaunt his abilities. Gough explained A.C. would be able to swim faster than humans, breathe underwater, as well as have super strength while underwater. He also stated that exposure to water on land <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> powers. The extent of his speed is shown in the pilot, when Arthur is able to keep up with a fighter jet flying above him. The extent of A.C.'s ability to breathe underwater was not elaborated upon, but he is seen swimming near the bottom of the ocean near the start of the pilot. When A.C. is talking to Eva about releasing captive dolphins, he tells her that he felt as though the dolphins were somehow calling to him. In the comics, one of Aquaman's powers is the ability to communicate with sea life. Gough likened A.C.'s not having access to water to Clark's growing weak around kryptonite in Smallville – if A.C. does not get water, he will dehydrate and weaken. Water gives him a power boost and enables producers to explore stories on land.|$|E
5|$|James {{became an}} {{unrestricted}} free agent at 12:01am EDT on July 1, 2010. During this time, he was contacted by several teams, including the Bulls, Los Angeles Clippers, Miami Heat, New York Knicks, New Jersey Nets, and Cavaliers. On July 8, he announced on a live ESPN special titled The Decision {{that he would}} sign with the Heat. The telecast was broadcast from the Boys & Girls Club of Greenwich, Connecticut and raised $2.5 million for the charity. An additional $3.5 million was raised from advertising revenue, which was donated to other charities. The day before the special, fellow free agents Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade had also announced that they would sign with Miami; reports later arose that back in 2006 the trio had discussed among themselves their upcoming 2010 free agencies. James decided to join with Bosh and Wade in part {{so that he could}} shoulder less of the offensive load; he thought that his improved teammates <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> a better chance of winning an NBA championship than had he stayed in Cleveland. Heat president Pat Riley {{played a major role in}} selling James on the idea of playing with Bosh and Wade. James would be relieved of the burden of scoring, and he thought he could be the first player since Oscar Robertson to average a triple-double in a season.|$|E
