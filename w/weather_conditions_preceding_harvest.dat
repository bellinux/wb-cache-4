40|$|International audienceIn France, the {{monitoring}} of landfill cover after {{closure of the}} site is a local problem, since its tightness must be ensured over time. Leaks in the cover are a problem, as they allow water to infiltrate the stored waste. In order to locate such leaks, electrical resistivity tomography was used on an experimental site in which defects had been intentionally made in the cover. Repeated measurements taken on this site showed that the <b>weather</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>preceding</b> the measurements {{need to be taken}} into account, as they affect the water content in the cover material. They also showed that there are optimal <b>weather</b> <b>conditions</b> for detecting defects in the cover. A statistical analysis carried out on the electrical resistivity results for all surveys and cover material samples showed that the material was heterogeneous; this variability was mainly due to a difference in particle size (fines content) and in compaction. This study has shown the capacity of electrical resistivity tomography to detect defects and heterogeneity in the cover material, indicating that it is a good means of monitoring the quality of landfill cover both when it is put in place and subsequentl...|$|R
30|$|Changes in {{land use}} in the Knysna region have {{included}} afforestation of native fynbos shrubland vegetation with non-native pine trees, associated invasion of shrublands by pine trees spreading from plantations, and protection of fire-prone shrublands from fire. All of these changes have led to increases in fuel loads across the region. Growth in the human population {{has been accompanied by}} development in rural areas and an increase in the urban–wildland interface, increasing the risk of exposure to wildfires. These factors, combined with very high fire danger <b>weather</b> <b>conditions,</b> <b>preceded</b> by an unprecedented drought, led to the destructive wildfires in 2017. Events like these are infrequent, and people can quickly lose interest in implementing fire-wise practices and become increasingly willing to place developments in high-risk areas in the long inter-fire periods. Potentially useful responses could include the re-introduction of programs of prescribed burning in addition to fire suppression in key areas, effective programs to control the spread of invasive alien plants, a re-examination of the economic and ecological sustainability of commercial planting of invasive alien trees in fire-prone areas, and stricter regulation of residential and other development along the urban–wildland interface.|$|R

40|$|SummaryBackgroundThe aim of {{this study}} was to clarify the {{relationship}} between onset of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and <b>weather</b> <b>conditions,</b> to determine whether days in which AMI onset is likely can be predicted. Methods and resultsOf the 929 patients admitted to our hospitals in Kagoshima prefecture with AMI, subjects comprised 611 patients. Days of frequent onset (F-days) were defined as days with ≥ 3 patients/day admitted for AMI, with days of non-frequent onset (N-days) defined as days with < 3 patients/day. Meteorological factors were measured, and daily differences in all parameters and intraday temperature differences on the onset day, and 1 and 2 days before onset were calculated. F-days were significantly associated with intraday temperature differences on the onset day (10. 3 °C vs. 7. 9 °C, p= 0. 005), 1 day before onset (10. 7 °C vs. 7. 9 °C, p= 0. 002), and 2 days before onset (11. 3 °C vs. 7. 9 °C, p= 0. 0001). A cutoff intraday temperature difference of ≥ 9. 4 °C on 1 and 2 days before onset was predictive of F-days with 89 % sensitivity and 87 % specificity. ConclusionsIntraday temperature differences offer a powerful predictor of F-days. Onset of AMI can be predicted based on <b>weather</b> <b>conditions</b> over the <b>preceding</b> 1 – 2 days...|$|R

In the years 2004 – 2010, the vascular plant species composition was recorded annually on a total of eight fenced and eight control plots, each 2 m × 1 m in size. Treat-ment, time, and weather data were used as explanatory variables in ordination and correlation analyses. Cover values of different life forms and indicator values varied significantly in dependence on the <b>weather</b> <b>conditions</b> of the <b>preceding</b> five months; however, correlations varied according to the vegeta-tion type and were rather rarely detected. The effect of fencing appeared important in all study plots; however, the temporal trends were significant only in half of them. We did not find a significant interac-tion between treatment and time in the total dataset. A successional change was detected in one fenced plot only; in all other cases, the species composition fluctuated – a phenomenon that is not directly attributable to <b>weather</b> <b>conditions.</b> In the fenced plots, the herbaceous vegetation cover decreased, mainly due to litter accumulation and partly due to shrub encroachment.

40|$|Effects {{of local}} weather on {{individuals}} and populations are key drivers of wildlife responses to climatic changes. However, studies {{often do not}} last long enough to identify <b>weather</b> <b>conditions</b> that influence demographic processes, or to capture rare but extreme weather events at appropriate scales. In Iceland, farmers collect nest down of wild common eider Somateria mollissima and many farmers count nests within colonies annually, which reflects annual variation {{in the number of}} breeding females. We collated these data for 17 colonies. Synchrony in breeding numbers was generally low between colonies. We evaluated 1) demographic relationships with weather in nesting colonies of common eider across Iceland during 1900 – 2007; and 2) impacts of episodic weather events (aberrantly cold seasons or years) on subsequent breeding numbers. Except for episodic events, breeding numbers within a colony generally had no relationship to local <b>weather</b> <b>conditions</b> in the <b>preceding</b> year. However, common eider are sexually mature at 2 – 3 years of age and we found a 3 -year time lag between summer weather and breeding numbers for three colonies, indicating a positive effect of higher pressure, drier summers for one colony, and a negative effect of warmer, calmer summers for two colonies. These findings may represent weather effects on duckling production and subsequent recruitment. Weather effects were mostly limited to a few aberrant years causing reductions in breeding numbers, i. e. declines in several colonies followed severe winters (1918) and some years with high NAO (1992, 1995).

30|$|Conditions that {{facilitate}} sixweeks fescue proliferation {{are still not}} fully understood. Laboratory studies show that germination opportunities are optimized when winter temperatures fluctuate between 15 °C and 20 °C and coincide with adequate soil moisture (Hylton and Bement 1961). We also hypothesize that seasonal <b>weather</b> <b>conditions</b> during the <b>preceding</b> summer months (i.e., the growing season of the dominant perennial, blue grama) may be important because (1) germination is enhanced by increased inorganic nitrogen in the soil solution (Hylton and Bement 1961), {{which in turn is}} enhanced by prior summer drought (Evan and Burke 2013); (2) studies in the 1940 s and 1950 s showed that sixweeks fescue reached peak abundance in 1941 and 1958 (Hylton and Bement 1964), following drought conditions in the late 1930 s and 1954 to 1956; and (3) sixweeks fescue proliferation in our study (2013 to 2016) followed a severe drought in 2012. We suggest that rangeland managers be especially aware of the potential for sixweeks fescue germination and establishment during warm, wet winters that follow drought years, and consider the use of dormant-season prescribed fire to adaptively reduce negative impacts of sixweeks fescue on forage production and resultant livestock production. Prescribed fire may provide a valuable alternative to the use of herbicides because it also can benefit wildlife species of conservation concern (Augustine and Derner 2012) and enhance forage quality for livestock early in the growing season (Augustine et al. 2010).|$|R

30|$|However, {{vehicle speed}} {{decreased}} due to bad <b>weather</b> <b>conditions</b> (rain and snow) and the decrease was substantially higher on roads without lighting than on roads with lighting.
