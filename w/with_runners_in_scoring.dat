5|$|Next, the Dodgers came to Citizens Bank Park for {{a three-game}} series. After the Phillies lost game one (2–0) in a pitchers' duel between Hernandez and Clayton Kershaw, {{when they were}} zero-for-nine <b>with</b> <b>runners</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> position, David Buchanan made his major-league debut on May 24. The Phillies won 5–3, with Buchanan getting the win after a five-inning start and Papelbon earning his 13th save. The next day, Josh Beckett pitched a no-hitter for a 6–0 Dodger victory. The next day (Memorial Day), Kendrick had his first win since August 6, 2013; Howard's five RBIs gave the Phillies a 9–0 win over the Colorado Rockies. The team lost game two of the series, 6–2, despite Ben Revere's first major-league home run; Hamels allowed four runs in seven innings, and Jeff Manship gave up two more in the eighth.|$|E
5|$|Uribe {{began his}} {{professional}} career in 1997 {{when he was}} signed by the Colorado Rockies. After advancing through the minors, he made his MLB debut with the Rockies in 2001. He became their shortstop in 2001 and spent all of 2002 in that capacity. He missed part of 2003 with an injury and {{was traded to the}} Chicago White Sox following the season. After one season as a utility player, Uribe became the starting shortstop for the White Sox in 2005; he held that position for the next three years. While Uribe was with the White Sox, the team won the 2005 World Series against the Houston Astros. Uribe hit 21 home runs in 2006 but had a low on-base percentage. He hit 20 home runs in 2007 but had a low batting average <b>with</b> <b>runners</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> position (RISP). In 2008, Uribe lost his starting shortstop role to Orlando Cabrera and shifted to the starter at second, but then lost that job to rookie Alexei Ramírez. He eventually ended the season as the team's third baseman due to an injury to Joe Crede.|$|E
25|$|Notably, García faced though {{pitching}} {{in the early}} going with the likes of Babe Birrer, José Bracho, Dick Starr, Sandy Ullrich, Roy Welmaker and Lenny Yochim, for name a few. Nevertheless, he delivered rewarding results in the years to come, earning respect as a dangerous hitter <b>with</b> <b>runners</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> position, particularly during the late innings.|$|E
2500|$|Only 3rd series lost, June 14–16. The Cardinals lost a 2-of-3 {{series to}} the Miami Marlins, only the 3rd series {{lost in the}} season (after 69 games) since a 2-of-3 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates on April 26–28. The team still leads MLB with a 44–25 (.638) record, and {{first place in the}} NL Central by 2 [...] over the Cincinnati Reds. The team leads MLB in a [...]342 batting average <b>with</b> RISP (<b>runners</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> position), while the Chicago Cubs have the worst batting average with a [...]226 when RISP.|$|R
50|$|Although the Gators had {{chances in}} this game, namely {{in the bottom}} of the 1st <b>with</b> two <b>runners</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> {{position}} and 1 out, they were not able to capitalize. The game was methodical for innings two through four, but the top of the fifth saw Baylor take its first lead in the three-game series. Catcher Courtney Oberg singled to left field, left fielder Tiffany Wesley reached on an error by pitcher Stacey Nelson while Oberg's pinch runner made it to third, and she scored after the second error of the inning by shortstop Megan Bush. Nelson quickly forced Meagan Weldon into a groundout to limit the damage to one run. The only offense generated by the Gators after that was a single by Bush {{in the bottom of}} the 5th. Nelson took the loss for the Gators.|$|R
50|$|Corrie Brooks and Michelle Moultrie {{recorded}} the hits for the Gators, as Brooks tallied an infield {{single in the}} third and Moultrie nailed a single to left field in the sixth. Washington, on the other hand, wasted no time getting on base in the first, but the Gators squashed the Huskies’ attempts to cross the plate. Ashley Charters started the game off with a high chopper back to the mound and beat Nelson’s throw to first. She then advanced to third on a Gator error on Kimi Pohlman’s grounder. <b>With</b> two <b>runners</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> position, Jennifer Salling grounded to sophomore second baseman Aja Paculba, who fired home to Kristina Hilberth to tag out Charter and keep the Huskies off the board. Nelson went to work, getting the next batter swinging and next to ground out to end the <b>inning</b> and leave <b>runners</b> stranded at the corners.|$|R
25|$|Nationals closer Sean Doolittle set the Cubs down {{in order}} {{in the top of}} the ninth, and Davis – {{completing}} his longest outing since 2012 – returned to retire Turner, Werth, and Harper in the bottom of the ninth, throwing 44 pitches in his outing, 10 more than he had thrown in any single appearance during the regular season. The season endied on a Harper strikeout on a full count. Despite going 1-for-11 <b>with</b> <b>runners</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> position and walking nine Nationals hitters, the Cubs won the 4-hour 37-minute game 9-8 and the series 3-2 and advanced to face the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 2017 National League Championship Series.|$|E
25|$|Cardinals clinch NL Central on September 27. The Cardinals {{clinched}} the NL Central title {{at home on}} September 27. It was their first NL Central title since 2009. It was their seventh division title since 2000, thanks to 20 rookies, 12 of them had never before appeared in the majors before this year. They were second three consecutive years prior to 2013. The club has a 16-6 record since Allen Craig was lost {{for the remainder of}} the regular season on September 4, with a foot injury. The club previously lost their ace (Chris Carpenter), their shortstop (Rafael Furcal), and their closer (Jason Motte) before Opening Day, plus two more starting pitchers in May and then cleanup hitter Craig, who has the majors highest batting average (.454) <b>with</b> <b>runners</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> position. He has been ruled doubtful for the 2013 National League Division Series against the Pittsburgh Pirates, because of his Lisfranc injury to his left foot.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{failed to}} score a run and left eight men on base through five innings.	Ethier, pinch hitting, scored Pederson on a single in the sixth inning for the Dodgers' only run. They only had one hit in 13 chances <b>with</b> <b>runners</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> {{position}} in the game. Kershaw pitched four scoreless innings of relief in the game, and in the process, he broke Orel Hershiser's Dodgers postseason record with his 33rd strikeout. Morton pitched four innings of relief to earn the win, as Corey Seager grounded out to José Altuve, who threw to Yuli Gurriel to end the game, series, baseball season, and their 55-year drought. The Astros became the third consecutive road team to win a World Series Game 7 {{as well as the}} fourth consecutive team to end a World Series on the road (after the 2014 Giants, 2015 Royals and 2016 Cubs). They also became just the second team to win a seven game League Championship Series and a seven game World Series in the same year, following the 1985 Kansas City Royals. Springer won the World Series MVP Award.|$|E
50|$|Nevertheless, Morris {{was in a}} jam as {{he faced}} Gant <b>with</b> two <b>runners</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> position. After {{retiring}} Gant on a groundout to Kent Hrbek at first base, Morris became visibly annoyed when Twins manager Tom Kelly came out {{to talk to him}} as he believed Kelly was going to pull him from the game. Instead, Kelly told Morris that he was thinking about giving an intentional walk to David Justice and pitching to Sid Bream, with only three hits in the six previous games, instead. Morris agreed, and Bream stepped up with the bases loaded. Morris induced Bream to ground to first. Hrbek went home to force out Smith, who was still at third, and Harper relayed the ball back to first to retire Bream, one of baseball's slowest baserunners, in time to complete the 3-2-3 double play and end the inning. The Braves would not reach base again {{for the rest of the}} game.|$|R
50|$|Game 4 saw {{a rematch}} of Game 1: David Wells vs. Charles Nagy. In {{the top of}} the second, {{back-to-back}} homers by Rafael Palmeiro and Bobby Bonilla to lead off the inning gave the Orioles a 2-0 lead. Then, Sandy Alomar, Jr.'s two-run single tied the game in the fourth. In the fifth, the Indians broke the tie with an RBI hit by Omar Vizquel. The bats on both sides were then silenced until {{the top of the}} ninth inning, when José Mesa came on in a save situation and looked to extend the series to a deciding Game 5. However, the Orioles managed to tie the game with one out left to go. The score was tied 3-3 and it looked like the Indians might win the game in the bottom half <b>with</b> two <b>runners</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> position and two out for Kenny Lofton, but he struck out to force extra innings. In the top of the twelfth, the Orioles recaptured the lead when Roberto Alomar (who would play for Cleveland later in his career) hit the go-ahead home run. Randy Myers would finish off the Indians and send the Orioles to the 1996 American League Championship Series.|$|R
50|$|Davis {{came back}} in to pitch {{the top of the}} 9th after having waited just over an hour between in-game pitches. Martin greeted Davis with his first hit of the series on a single to center-field. Dalton Pompey then came in to run for Martin and {{promptly}} stole 2nd base to put the tying run <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> position. Then on a 2-2 pitch into the dirt to Kevin Pillar, Pompey stole 3rd and Perez couldn’t scoop up the ball to even make a throw. That put a <b>runner</b> on 3rd <b>with</b> no outs and a 3-2 count to Pillar. After a foul ball, Davis missed on a pitch inside to walk Pillar to put runners on the corners with no outs. Dioner Navarro came in to pinch-hit for Goins with Toronto needing a catcher to replace Martin. On a 1-1 pitch, Davis got a called strike that was high and outside. The Toronto dugout not only started complaining about that, but they believed Davis should’ve been called for a quick pitch balk, which would have brought the tying run home. Instead it was a 1-2 count and Davis got Navarro to swing and miss for the first out. However, Pillar stole 2nd on the pitch to leave the Royals without a double-play chance and thus putting 2 <b>runners</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> position. That brought up Revere who worked a 2-1 count when Davis threw a called strike to make it a 2-2 count. On the next pitch, Revere swung and missed for the second strikeout of the inning, bringing up Donaldson <b>with</b> two <b>runners</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> position <b>in</b> a 4-3 game. On a 2-1 pitch Donaldson grounded out to 3rd for the final out to clinch back-to-back AL Pennants for the Kansas City Royals.|$|R
25|$|In {{the wildest}} and largest ninth-inning {{comeback}} win all season, the Cardinals {{at home on}} August 8, scored all five of their runs {{in the bottom of}} the ninth after two outs, for a 5-4 win. Previously, the team was an awful 2-45 when trailing after eight innings. The team fell into a 0-4 hole, and were 0-for-11 <b>with</b> <b>runners</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> position. It was the 10th time in the last 15 games that a starter could not get to the sixth inning. Down to his last strike at 1-2, Brandon Moss got the tying run in with a bases-loaded walk, and Yadier Molina then finished off the improbable comeback win by getting hit in the ribs by a pitch. The Cardinals have won three of the last four Major League games to end on a walk-off hit-by-pitch. It happened most recently for St. Louis on Aug. 14, 2014, when Jon Jay took a pitch off his body. That was also against the Reds. With the win, the team got its 59th win against 53 losses, tying the Miami Marlins for the second Wild Card spot with 50 games remaining in the season. Michael Wacha could go only five innings, as the fifth starter in a week to not get to the sixth inning.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{began the}} regular season at home on April 1 against the San Francisco Giants. Clayton Kershaw made the opening day start for the third {{straight}} season and pitched a complete game shutout as the Dodgers won 4-0. Kershaw also hit his first career home run in the game, for the Dodgers' first run {{in the bottom of the}} 8th. Korean pitcher Hyun-jin Ryu made his Major League debut the following day, allowing three runs (one earned) on 10 hits in 6 1/3 innings to pick up the 3-0 loss. The Dodgers went 1 for 14 <b>with</b> <b>runners</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> position in the series finale, and Pablo Sandoval and Hunter Pence hit homers off Josh Beckett as the Giants won 5-3. Zack Greinke made his Dodgers debut on April 5, pitching a two-hitter for 6 1/3 innings in the Dodgers' 3-0 win. Andre Ethier hit a solo homer in the game. In his second start of the season, Kershaw pitched seven shutout innings while striking out nine and only allowing two hits in the 1-0 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates. The Dodgers finished off their three-game sweep of the Pirates with a 6-2 win on April 7. Adrian Gonzalez had four RBI and Ryu picked up his first Major League win in the game.|$|E
25|$|The Phillies were 36-45 and 11 {{games behind}} {{the first place}} Nationals after their series against the Marlins. The Phillies started the month by taking 1 of 3 from the New York Mets. The one win, however, came with Cliff Lee finally winning his {{first game of the}} season after 13 starts. The streak tied for 5th for the longest winless streak for a pitcher. The Phillies would end the first half by getting swept by the Atlanta Braves. They ended the first half with a {{disastrous}} 37–50 mark, their worst since 1997. The Phillies seemed to have woken up in the second half, as they would take 2 of 3 from the Colorado Rockies and Los Angeles Dodgers. Although they only took 1 of 3 from the San Francisco Giants, they would make it up by sweeping the Milwaukee Brewers, all from late comebacks. The sweep was their first 3-game sweep of the year. The sweep, however, got taken back by the Braves as they would get swept by them again because they had a hard time <b>with</b> <b>runners</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> position. The sweep woke up the Phillies, as they would blow out the Washington Nationals in the 1st game of the series on July 31, 8–0. The Phillies would end up taking 2 of 3 from the Nationals. After the series against the Nationals on August 2, the Phillies were 47–58, 15 and a half games behind the first place Nationals, and 13 game behind the second wild card. Although their playoff chances are slim, the Phillies performance after the all-star break looked promising for next season. Throughout the month, knowing that they will likely not make the post-season, the Phillies made trades with some of their players. One of the trades were Hunter Pence getting traded to the Giants for Nate Schierholtz, Tommy Joseph, and Seth Rosin. Another trade was Shane Victorino getting trading to the Dodgers for 2 pitchers. Pitcher Joe Blanton also got involved in a trade with the Dodgers. The Phillies would also resign Cole Hamels to a six-year, $144 million extension, the second-largest contract for a pitcher in baseball history.|$|E
500|$|Ruth {{returned}} to his normal production during 1926, when he batted [...]372 with 47 home runs and 146 RBIs. The Yankees built a 10-game lead by mid-June and coasted to win the pennant by three games. The St. Louis Cardinals had won the National League with the lowest winning percentage for a pennant winner to that point (.578) and the Yankees were expected to win the World Series easily. Although the Yankees won the opener in New York, St. Louis took Games Two and Three. In Game Four, Ruth hit three home runs—the first time this had been done in a World Series game—to lead the Yankees to victory. In the fifth game, Ruth caught a ball as he crashed into the fence. The play was described by baseball writers as a defensive gem. New York took that game, but Grover Cleveland Alexander won Game Six for St. Louis to tie the Series at three games each, then got very drunk. He was nevertheless inserted into Game Seven {{in the seventh inning}} and shut down the Yankees to win the game, 3–2, and win the Series. Ruth had hit his fourth home run of the Series earlier in the game, and was the only Yankee to reach base off Alexander, walking in the ninth inning before being caught stealing to end the game. Although Ruth's attempt to steal second is often deemed a baserunning blunder, Creamer pointed out that the Yankees' chances of tying the game would have been greatly improved <b>with</b> a <b>runner</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> position.|$|R
5000|$|Facing {{elimination}} {{against the}} Athletics in Game 6 of the 1911 World Series, Meyers' Giants trailed 6-1 entering {{the bottom of}} the seventh in Philadelphia. After Chief Bender opened the frame with a flyout, two singles and an error by first baseman Fred Merkle fielding a throw on a sacrifice bunt made the score 7-1. Two consecutive singles would score two further runs, then <b>with</b> <b>runners</b> at the corners, Harry Davis hit a 2-1 pitch into right-center to make it 10-1. Continuing the rally, Jack Barry hit a ground rule double into the right field crowd scoring another run and putting runners at second and third, which finally convinced John McGraw to replace his pitcher, Hooks Wiltse, having given up 7 earned runs over 2 1/3 innings. Future Hall of Famer Rube Marquard, who had gone 24-7 that year with a 2.50 ERA and a career-high 237 strikeouts, came into pitch <b>with</b> two <b>runners</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> position and his team down by ten. His third pitch was so fast and wild that it [...] "dented the screen in the grand stand". Both runners scored on the play because Meyers [...] "refused to chase the ball", instead [...] "glaring at Marquard" [...] in obvious frustration. After a [...] "heated conference" [...] between the battery mates near home plate, order ensued, but the next batter promptly singled off Marquard. The emotional and adrenaline-fueled Meyers then threw out the runner trying to steal second base, stopping the rally. The next batter struck out, ending the inning, although the 11-run lead would prove enough to secure a championship for Philadelphia.|$|R
5000|$|... 7:30 p.m. (EDT) at Busch Stadium in St. Louis, MissouriGame 5 saw {{a battle}} of the aces with Adam Wainwright on the short end as Lester pitched another gem of 7 2/3 innings. Boston struck first on {{back-to-back}} one out doubles by Dustin Pedroia and David Ortiz, who continued his monstrous tear, hitting [...]733 in the series. Wainwright ended up striking out the side {{in the first two}} innings before Jon Lester broke the streak with a groundout. St. Louis had back-to-back leadoff singles {{in the second and third}} by Carlos Beltrán and David Freese, latter advanced to second on a sacrifice bunt by Pete Kozma but was left <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> position. <b>In</b> the fourth Ortiz tied a World Series record by Billy Hatcher on a hit, reaching base in nine consecutive plate appearances, but failed to set a new record by flying out to center field in the sixth. With one out in the bottom of the fourth, Matt Holliday hit a solo shot to center field to tie the game. Boston threatened in the fifth after a leadoff hit by Xander Bogaerts and a one out single by David Ross but Wainwright struck out Lester and Ellsbury to strand both runners. After a leadoff single by Bogaerts, Stephen Drew walked and Ross drove in one run on a ground rule double to left field. <b>With</b> two <b>runners</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> position Ellsbury's single scored Drew but Ross was tagged out at home plate on the throw by Shane Robinson. In the bottom of the eighth Lester allowed a one out double against Freese and Koji Uehara took over the mound for a four out save after Kozma hit a fly ball to left field for the second out of the inning. Uehara struck out pinch hitter Matt Adams on three pitches for the third out. The Red Sox closer struck out Matt Carpenter, grounded out pinch hinter John Jay and Holliday flew out to right field to earn the save in back-to-back games. This was the first game of this series neither team committed an error.|$|R
500|$|After {{struggling}} to hit <b>with</b> <b>runners</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> position the previous year, Kemp bounced back and hit well <b>with</b> <b>runners</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> position.

500|$|Youkilis {{tied for}} the major league lead in {{sacrifice}} flies (11) and led the AL with 4.43 pitches per plate appearance and by hitting line drives 24% of time that he put balls in play. Also that year, Youkilis {{finished second in the}} AL in pitches seen (3,009) and percent of pitches taken (63.8), 4th in OBP <b>with</b> <b>runners</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> position with two outs (.524), 7th in bases on balls (91; the six players ahead of him averaged 41 home runs and 14 intentional walks, while Youkilis hit only 13 homers and was not intentionally walked once), tied for 7th in [...] "bases taken" [...] (22; advanced on fly balls, passed balls, wild pitches, balks, etc.), 8th in doubles (42) and batting average <b>with</b> <b>runners</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> position with two out (.375), 9th in walk percentage (13.8%), and 10th in times on base (259). He scored 100 runs, hit for a [...]325 batting average <b>with</b> <b>runners</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> position, and hit four first inning leadoff home runs.

50|$|In the {{deciding}} {{game of the}} World Series, Tim Hudson took the mound for the Giants setting a new record for the oldest pitcher to start a World Series game. Jeremy Guthrie was the starter for the Royals. After being sent down in order in the 1st inning, the Giants offense awoke in the 2nd. Pablo Sandoval started the inning {{being hit by a}} pitch, Hunter Pence and Brandon Belt followed with base hits to load the sacks with nobody out. Michael Morse and Brandon Crawford produced consecutive sacrifice flies to give the Giants a 2-0 lead. The advantage was to be short-lived, as Hudson gave up a single to Billy Butler and an RBI double to Alex Gordon. Salvador Pérez was drilled by a pitch that forced him to hobble down to first base. Mike Moustakas hit a fly-ball to left-field, and Gordon tagged up to go to third base, allowing Omar Infante to tie the game with a sacrifice fly. Alcides Escobar singled, and that was that for Hudson as the Giants were forced to remove a starter {{before the end of the}} 2nd inning for two straight games. Jeremy Affeldt came into the game and got the Giants out of the inning. In the bottom of the 3rd inning, the Giants turned a potentially game-changing double play after the leadoff man reached. Joe Panik dived to snare a ball hit off the bat of Eric Hosmer, flipped the ball with his glove to Crawford who turned the ball over to first base where, after a replay review called for by the Giants, Hosmer was ruled out having elected to slide head-first. In the top of the 4th, Sandoval and Pence again reached to start the inning, and Morse knocked in the go-ahead run off Kelvin Herrera. From that point on, the game became all about the pitchers. Affeldt pitched the fourth, keyed by another Panik-Crawford-Belt double play, before the Giants called upon Madison Bumgarner to hold the lead. The Royals missed two chances <b>with</b> a <b>runner</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> position <b>in</b> the 5th. Bumgarner retired 12 hitters in a row to send the game into the 9th inning with the Giants holding a one-run lead. Instead of electing to use his closer, manager Bruce Bochy allowed Bumgarner to go out and pitch the 9th. Hosmer struck out and Butler popped up and the Giants were an out away. Gordon hit a sinking liner that was misplayed by Gregor Blanco in center field, and then bobbled by Juan Pérez and Gordon reached third base. With Salvador Pérez batting, Bumgarner induced a pop up that was caught by Sandoval and the Giants won the World Series title. Bumgarner's personal performance earned him the World Series MVP. Incredibly only three days after making 117 pitches in shutting out the Royals in Game 5, Bumgarner pitched 5 innings of scoreless relief making 68 pitches and not walking a batter. He broke the record set by Curt Schilling for the most innings pitched in a single postseason.|$|R

However, he struck out 49 times and batted just [...]225 in that spot. [...] Against right-handed pitching, he batted just [...]233 with a [...]299 on-base percentage, to go along with 22 home runs and 69 RBIs, as opposed to a [...]295 average against left-handed pitchers.|$|E
