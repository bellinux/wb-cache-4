Blacks and Hispanics {{are more likely}} than <b>Whites</b> <b>or</b> Asians to be unemployed. When employed, Blacks and Hispanics are much more likely than <b>Whites</b> <b>or</b> Asians to be working in lower-paying occupations...|$|R

5|$|All birds lay amniotic {{eggs with}} hard shells made mostly of calcium carbonate. Hole and burrow nesting species tend to lay <b>white</b> <b>or</b> pale eggs, while open nesters lay camouflaged eggs. There are many {{exceptions}} to this pattern, however; the ground-nesting nightjars have pale eggs, and camouflage is instead provided by their plumage. Species that are victims of brood parasites have varying egg colours to improve the chances of spotting a parasite's egg, which forces female parasites to match their eggs to those of their hosts.|$|E
5|$|Amanita ocreata, {{commonly}} known as the death angel, destroying angel, angel of death or more precisely western North American destroying angel, is a deadly poisonous basidiomycete fungus, one of many in the genus Amanita. Occurring in the Pacific Northwest and California floristic provinces of North America, A. ocreata associates with oak trees. The large fruiting bodies (the mushrooms) generally appear in spring; the cap may be <b>white</b> <b>or</b> ochre and often develops a brownish centre, while the stipe, ring, gill and volva are all white.|$|E

5|$|An {{individual}} {{killer whale}} {{can often be}} identified from its dorsal fin and saddle patch. Variations such as nicks, scratches, and tears on the dorsal fin and the pattern of <b>white</b> <b>or</b> grey in the saddle patch are unique. Published directories contain identifying photographs and names for hundreds of North Pacific animals. Photographic identification has enabled the local population of killer whales to be counted each year rather than estimated, and has enabled great insight into lifecycles and social structures.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers {{originally}} {{supposed that}} the entire trans-Neptunian population would show a similar red surface colour, as they were thought to have originated in the same region and subjected to the same physical processes. Specifically, SDOs were expected to have large amounts of surface methane, chemically altered into complex organic molecules by energy from the Sun. This would absorb blue light, creating a reddish hue. Most classical objects display this colour, but scattered objects do not; instead, they present a <b>white</b> <b>or</b> greyish appearance.|$|E
