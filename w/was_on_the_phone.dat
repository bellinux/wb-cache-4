25|$|In the {{new version}} from the December 21 interview, Mangum claims she was {{attacked}} from 11:35p.m. to midnight, much earlier than her previous accusations. This new timing is before the well-documented alibi evidence for Reade Seligmann that places {{him away from the}} house. However, the defense revealed that this new timing would suggest Seligmann <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> with his girlfriend {{during the height of the}} attack. Additionally, she received an incoming call at 11:36p.m. and somebody stayed on the line for 3 minutes, which would be during the party according to the new timetable.|$|E
25|$|Westlake {{now has a}} full clock schedule: Making {{the skin}} last longer than 99 minutes, visiting Julie, {{studying}} his enemies and even mimicking their voice patterns- in order to assume their identities to cause confusion and sow dissension. This culminates in him impersonating Durant himself, causing confusion among the mobster and his henchmen. When Westlake and Julie have a date at the carnival, an altercation causes Westlake to lose his temper and inadvertently reveals to Julie that there is indeed something wrong with him. She follows him as he flees (his 99 minutes were up,) and when she discovers his discarded mask, she calls to Peyton that she still loves him regardless. Julie tells Strack she can no longer see him, and after discovering the Bellasarious Memorandum on his desk while he <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> confirms he was collaborating with Durant the entire time. She reveals Westlake is still alive, but Strack tells her {{as long as he}} has the memorandum, no charges can be filed. When Julie leaves, Durant enters and is told to capture Julie and kill Westlake.|$|E

While Warhol <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> Solanas fired at him three times. Her first two shots missed, but the third went through both lungs, his spleen, stomach, liver, and esophagus. She then shot art critic Mario Amaya in the hip. She tried to shoot Fred Hughes, Warhol's manager, in the head but her gun jammed. Hughes asked her to leave, which she did, leaving behind a paper bag with her address book on a table.

James Bevel wove in and out of the crowds warning them, [...] "If any cops get hurt, we're going to lose this fight." [...] At 3p.m., the protest was over. [...] During a kind of truce, protesters went home. Police removed the barricades and re-opened the streets to traffic.

The State's first witness for this charge was Shaik's former secretary, Bianca Singh, who gave testimony while accompanied by three bodyguards. She stated that [...] "Zuma was quite close to Shaik. They would speak {{on the phone and}} he would come to visit." [...] She also testified that Shaik arranged financial affairs for Zuma, managed his bank accounts on the computer, and discussed his financial situation with him.

[...] "During the height of all of these developments, when I <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> with senior Georgian officials, they sure sounded completely convinced that Russian armored vehicles had entered the Roki Tunnel, and exited the Roki Tunnel, before and during the cease-fire," [...] he stated.

Peters testified that while Zakaria <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> Markhasev walked off without saying where he was going. Within a few minutes, Peters heard a loud noise like a car backfiring, and Markhasev ran back to the car, saying, [...] "Let's go. We've got to get out of here. Let's go." [...] Markhasev refused to tell them what had happened, but they stopped at a wooded area that matched the description of where the murder weapon was later discovered.|$|E

By 11 am Saturday morning on opening day, the traffic police closed the festival, and were telling people to go home, announcing on radio that the event could accommodate no more patrons. They ordered the organizers to remove the entry gates to free the roads, as vehicles and pedestrians were banked up in all directions for some 20 kilometers. But still they arrived. Some 5 kilometers towards Waihi a tent city spontaneously arose on a neighboring farm where approximately 15,000 people parked and then walked the final leg into the festival site. Others abandoned their vehicles in Waihi itself and made the pilgrimage to Nambassa on foot.|$|E

Ashley had already testified to having witnessed her mother working on the computer on something she had hidden to prevent Ashley's seeing it. Fitzpatrick claimed this was the day Castor wrote the note, which had Castor's fingerprints but not Ashley's, to frame her daughter. He told the jury about the word antifreeze being written as [...] "anti-free" [...] in four places within the note and noted that Castor had also said [...] "anti-free" [...] during an interview. Castor said she had cut herself off while saying [...] "antifreeze" [...] because she had intended to say something else.|$|E

Anita said she mistook the cocking of the gun for the sound of his typewriter keys and hung up as he fired. Will and Jennifer were in the next room when they heard the gunshot, but mistook the sound for a book falling and did not check on Thompson immediately. Juan Thompson found his father's body. According to the police report and Anita's cell phone records, he called the sheriff's department half an hour later, then walked outside and fired three shotgun blasts into the air to [...] "mark the passing of his father".

[...] The identity of her lover was kept secret from both the cast and the crew; all scenes of Kat with her lover were filmed with an extra. Speaking of the storyline, Executive Producer Lorraine Newman said: [...] "The consequences are not only great for Kat and Alfie, but also for each individual suspect. The audience will join the cast and crew guessing across the summer and autumn as we eliminate the suspects one at a time, leading to one almighty explosion." [...] After the storyline {{was announced}}, five suspects were revealed as potential candidates: Ray Dixon (Chucky Venn), Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd), Max Branning (Jake Wood), Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman) and Jack Branning (Scott Maslen). In a poll on the website Digital Spy, Jack Branning was shown to be the favourite with 43.5% of the votes. Ray was eliminated when he walked in on Kat while she <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> to her lover. Michael was eliminated when Kat confessed to him that she was having an affair. With only the three Branning brothers left as suspects, it was revealed on 20 December that Kat's mystery lover was Derek.|$|E

Sheldrake and Smart [1, 2] conducted experiments where participants had to determine which one of four possible callers <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> while <b>the</b> telephone was still ringing.

In study one, 21 participants were asked to iden-tify the callers of 20 phone calls each. Overall 26. 7 % were identified correctly (mean chance expectation 25 %, ns). In a second study a pre-selection test was introduced in a different experimental setting. Eight participants identified 30 % of the calls correctly (p =. 15). However one of the participants recognized 10 out of 20 calls correctly (p =. 014). We conducted a third study with only this participant. In an additional 60 trials she could identify 24 callers correctly (p =. 007). We conclude that we could not find any anomalous cognition effect in self-selected samples. But our data also strongly suggest that there are a few participants who are able to score reliably and repeatedly above chance.
