5|$|A {{year before}} their 1972 Eldredge and Gould paper, Niles Eldredge {{published}} {{a paper in}} the journal Evolution <b>which</b> <b>suggested</b> that gradual evolution was seldom seen in the fossil record and argued that Ernst Mayr's standard mechanism of allopatric speciation might suggest a possible resolution.|$|E

40|$|Autism is {{a highly}} {{uncertain}} entity and little is said about it {{with any degree of}} certainty. Scientists must, and do, work through these uncertainties {{in the course of their}} work. Scientists explain uncertainty in autism research through discussion of epistemological uncertainties <b>which</b> <b>suggest</b> that diverse methods and techniques make results hard to reconcile, ontological uncertainties <b>which</b> <b>suggest</b> doubt over taxonomic coherence, but also through reference to autism’s indeterminacy <b>which</b> <b>suggests</b> that the condition is inherently heterogeneous. Indeed, indeterminacy takes two forms – an inter-personal form <b>which</b> <b>suggests</b> that there are fundamental differences between individuals with autism and an intra-personal form <b>which</b> <b>suggests</b> that no one factor is able to explain all features of autism within a given individual. What is apparent in the case of autism is that scientists put uncertainty and indeterminacy into discussion with one another and, rather than a well policed epistemic-ontic boundary, there is a movement between, and an entwinement of, the two. Understanding scientists’ dialogue concerning uncertainty and indeterminacy is of importance for understanding autism and autistic heterogeneity but also for understanding uncertainty and ‘uncertainty work’ within science more generally...|$|R

5|$|Guillemin was {{a member}} of the team that beat Scotland at Colombes in 1911 and won France's first victory in the Five Nations. After all the {{previous}} French losses to the Home Nations teams, the Scottish were favourites to win, and France's unexpected win was considered a great occasion by the French press. It proved a reversal of the defeats, accompanied with humiliating press commentary <b>which</b> <b>suggested</b> that the French were too idle and debauched to produce a team worthy of their British opponents.|$|E
5|$|In 1965 Hugh LeMessurier and Brian Andrew Hills {{published}} their paper, A thermodynamic approach {{arising from}} a study on Torres Strait diving techniques, <b>which</b> <b>suggested</b> that decompression following schedules based on conventional models results in asymptomatic bubble formation which must then be re-dissolved at the decompression stops {{before it can be}} eliminated. This is slower than allowing the gas to be eliminated while it is still in solution, and indicates the importance of minimising bubble phase gas for efficient decompression.|$|E

5|$|Prior to Mendel's work, the {{dominant}} theory of heredity {{was one of}} blending inheritance, <b>which</b> <b>suggested</b> that each parent contributed fluids to the fertilisation process and that the traits of the parents blended and mixed to produce the offspring. Charles Darwin developed a theory of inheritance he termed pangenesis, from Greek pan ("all, whole") and genesis ("birth") / genos ("origin"). Darwin used the term gemmule to describe hypothetical particles that would mix during reproduction.|$|E
5|$|That same year, J.J. Thomson {{conducted}} {{an experiment in}} which he channeled a stream of neon ions through magnetic and electric fields, striking a photographic plate at the other end. He observed two glowing patches on the plate, <b>which</b> <b>suggested</b> two different deflection trajectories. Thomson concluded this was {{because some of the}} neon ions had a different mass. The nature of this differing mass would later be explained by the discovery of neutrons in 1932.|$|E
5|$|The Singapore Stone is a {{fragment}} of a large sandstone slab which originally stood {{at the mouth of}} the Singapore River. The large slab, which is believed to date back to at least the 13th century and possibly as early as the 10th or 11th century, bore an undeciphered inscription. Recent theories suggest that the inscription is either in Old Javanese or in Sanskrit, <b>which</b> <b>suggested</b> a possibility that the island was an extension of the Majapahit civilisation in the past.|$|E

This would have pushed Wellington closer to Blücher, but may have cut Wellington's communications with his base at Ostend.

5|$|Alice and Hugh I {{married in}} the first half of 1210, with Alice {{receiving}} the County of Jaffa as the agreed upon dowry. Alice's sister, Philippa, married Erard of Ramerupt, who laid claim to Champagne and Brie on Philippa's behalf in 1213. Blanche of Navarre soon approached the Holy See to demand an investigation into the validity of the second and third marriage of Alice's and Philippa's mother, stating that her first marriage to Humphrey IV of Toron had not been canonically annulled. The inquiry conducted by Cardinal Robert of Courçon at the pope's order concluded that both Humphrey IV and Isabella I had protested against the annulment of their marriage, <b>which</b> <b>suggested</b> that Isabella I's two subsequent marriages were unlawful. However, the Holy See did not complete the investigation and thus the legitimacy of Alice (and her sister) was not questioned.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{similarities}} in morphology, tooth shape, and behavior, the closest {{relatives of the}} spinner shark were originally {{believed to be the}} blacktip shark and the graceful shark (C. amblyrhynchoides). However, this interpretation was not supported by Gavin Naylor's 1992 allozyme analysis, <b>which</b> <b>suggested</b> that these similarities are the product of convergent evolution and that the closest relative of the spinner shark is the copper shark (C. brachyurus). In a 2007 ribosomal DNA study, the spinner shark was found to be the most genetically divergent of all the requiem shark species examined save for the tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier), being less related to other Carcharhinus species than the lemon shark (Negaprion brevirostris).|$|E

5|$|Causes {{of death}} of adult ibis {{are not well}} known. Alligators could feasibly prey on nesting ibises {{but there has been}} little {{research}} in the area. A flock of fifty adult American white ibis were killed in a fire in the Everglades. The corpses were found in a dense swathe of cattail (Typha angustifolia), <b>which</b> <b>suggested</b> they had taken shelter there. It is unclear why they {{had not been able to}} fly away from the fire, but one hypothesis was that they had been foraging for insects disturbed by the fire.|$|E
5|$|Details of Carol's death were {{revealed}} in the post mortem. There were severe injuries to the skull, and {{it was said that}} her face had been smashed by multiple blows. It was later found in court that the murder weapon had been an ice axe. The body was found to be in a foetal position, <b>which</b> <b>suggested</b> that the body had been dealt with within a few hours of death, before rigor mortis could settle in. It has since been said that the investigators failed to acknowledge that rigor mortis passes in a 24‑to48‑hour time period, and that the body could feasibly have been trussed once rigor mortis had passed. Many unusual knots were used to tie the body, and the same knots were said to be used in Gordon Park's house and boat. This was one of the key pieces of evidence used against Gordon in the trial.|$|E
5|$|From the 740s {{until the}} end of the Northumbrian kingdom, coins were issued by most kings, {{although}} in variable quantities. Until recently no coins from Eardwulf's reign were known, <b>which</b> <b>suggested</b> that it may have been a time of instability, or perhaps that the kingdom was impoverished by the payment of tribute to Offa and Coenwulf of Mercia. It is now known that the issue of new coins continued during Eardwulf's reign, as two of his coins were identified in the 1990s. Issues of new currency appear to have been limited under Eardwulf, and significant numbers of Northumbrian coins are not again attested until the reign of Eardwulf's son Eanred.|$|E
