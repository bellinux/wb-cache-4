5|$|The International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) classifies the okapi as Endangered. It {{is fully}} {{protected}} under Congolese law. The Okapi <b>Wildlife</b> <b>Reserve</b> and Maiko National Park support significant {{populations of the}} okapi, though {{there has been a}} steady decline in numbers due to several threats. Other areas of occurrence are the Rubi Tele Hunting Reserve and the Abumombanzi Reserve. Major threats include habitat loss due to logging and human settlement. Extensive hunting for bushmeat and skin and illegal mining have also led to population declines. A threat that has emerged quite recently is the presence of illegal armed groups around protected areas, inhibiting conservation and monitoring actions. A small population occurs north of the Virunga National Park, but is bereft of protection due to the presence of armed groups in the vicinity. In June 2012, a gang of poachers attacked the headquarters of the Okapi <b>Wildlife</b> <b>Reserve,</b> killing six guards and other staff as well as all 14 okapis at their breeding center.|$|E

The traditional home sat on 39 hectares in the northwestern province Battambang, adjacent to Samlout national park in the Cardamom mountains, which had become infiltrated with poachers who threatened endangered species. She purchased the park's 60,000 hectares and turned the area into a <b>wildlife</b> <b>reserve</b> named for her son, the Maddox Jolie Project. In recognition of her conservation efforts, King Norodom Sihamoni awarded her Cambodian citizenship on July 31, 2005.|$|E

40|$|Extract] South Africa's <b>wildlife</b> <b>reserves</b> {{are a major}} tourist {{attraction}} and source of employment. The reserves have many of Africa's large wild mammals; however, attacks by these animals pose a risk not only to tourists but also to workers on the reserves. Commercial press records covering all South African newspapers were reviewed for a 10 - year period to identify all reported deaths and injuries to workers on <b>wildlife</b> <b>reserves</b> resulting from encounters with wild mammals. During the period, six workers were reported killed and 14 workers were reported injured in such encounters. Although better reporting mechanisms are needed, attacks on workers by wild mammals in South African <b>wildlife</b> <b>reserves</b> appear to be rare. None of the cases reviewed here can be considered an unnatural, unprovoked attack. It is essential that all workers on <b>wildlife</b> <b>reserves</b> have training on how to avoid attacks and how to respond if an attack occurs...|$|R

25|$|Douala Edéa <b>Wildlife</b> <b>Reserve,</b> a <b>wildlife</b> <b>reserve</b> in the Littoral Region of Cameroon, {{is located}} {{on either side of}} the mouth of the Sanaga River along the shores of the Bight of Biafra {{opposite}} the island of Bioko. The reserve was established in 1932. As of 2000, it covered 160,000 hectares (400,000 acres). Cameroon designated the reserve as a wildlife park for scientific purposes in 1971, Lake Tissongo, a lagoon connected to the south bank of the Sanaga river by a 5 kilometres (3.1mi) tidal channel, is included in the reserve. 80% of the reserve is covered by tropical lowland equatorial forest, and 15% by Atlantic mangrove forests. Fauna include forest elephants, primates (chimpanzees, monkey species such as black colobus), antelopes (sitatunga, blue duiker, etc.), West African manatees, sea turtles, dolphins, crocodiles, alligator, many fish species, terrestrial and water bird species. The red-capped mangabey was reported to be common in the reserve in 1972. The endangered red-eared nose-spotted guenon was reported in the Lombé part of the reserve in densities of 2-3 groups per square kilometers, but populations had dropped elsewhere due to hunting.|$|E
25|$|The Motithang Takin Preserve in Thimphu is a <b>wildlife</b> <b>reserve</b> {{area for}} takin, the National Animal of Bhutan. Originally a mini-zoo, it was {{converted}} into a preserve when {{it was discovered that}} the animals refrained from inhabiting the surrounding forest even when set free. The reason for declaring the takin as a National Animal of Bhutan on 25 November 2005 (Budorcas taxicolor) is attributed to a legend of the animal's creation in Bhutan in the 15th century by Lama Drukpa Kunley. The King of Bhutan believed that it was improper for a Buddhist country to confine animals for religious and environmental reasons, so he ordered the closure of the mini-zoo and the release of the animals into the forest. However, the Takin remained rooted to the town and were seen straying in the streets of Thimphu in search of fodder. Hence, an exclusive preserve was created for them to live freely.|$|E
25|$|The {{species is}} still {{present in the}} {{location}} where it was rediscovered in the Murchison Mountains. Small numbers have also been successfully translocated to five predator-free offshore islands, Tiritiri Matangi, Kapiti, Maud, Mana and Motutapu, {{where they can be}} viewed by the public. Additionally, captive takahē can be viewed at Te Anau and Pukaha/Mt Bruce wildlife centres. In June 2006 a pair of takahē were relocated to the Maungatautari Restoration Project. In September 2010 a pair of takahē (Hamilton and Guy) were released at Willowbank <b>Wildlife</b> <b>Reserve</b> - the first non-Department of Conservation institution to hold this species. In January 2011 two takahē were released in Zealandia, Wellington, and in mid-2015, two more takahē were released on Rotoroa Island in the Hauraki Gulf. There have also been relocations onto the Tawharanui Peninsula. In 2014 two pairs of Takahe were released into Wairakei golf and sanctuary, a private fenced sanctuary at Wairakei north of Taupo, the first chick was born there in November 2015.|$|E
