2500|$|Starting in 1943, Benaderet became Warner Bros.' primary {{voice of}} adult female {{supporting}} characters for their Merrie Melodies and Looney Tunes animated shorts.

Benaderet did not receive onscreen credit for her work, as she was employed by Warner Bros. as a freelance actor voicing peripheral characters and, unlike Mel Blanc, was not under contract with the studio. In 1955, she was succeeded by June Foray as Warner's premier female voice artist.|$|E
2500|$|The basic {{raison d'etre}} {{for all the}} cures was the [...] "assimilation of needed {{properties}} through the digestive system, from food taken into the body… [...] the proper equilibrium of the assimilating system."

[...] Substances used included oils, salts, herbs, iodine, <b>witch</b> <b>hazel,</b> magnesia, bismuth, alcohol, castoria, lactated pepsin, turpentine, charcoal, animated ash, soda, cream of tartar, aconite, laudanum, camphor, and gold solution.

40|$|A {{surprisingly}} {{large number}} of books have been written {{on the subject of}} winter gar-dens and plants of winter interest. Yet I have seen relatively few gardens in the United States specifically designated as "winter gardens. " Although winter gardens may be of only marginal interest in frost-free areas of the country and difficult to achieve where winters are long and severe, over much of the United States climatic conditions are such that many trees and shrubs of winter interest can be grown easily. A current trend that may eventually make winter gardens more common is an increas-ing interest among horticulturists in mul-tiseasonal woody plants. Various holly hy-brids and species, viburnums, and cultivars of such dogwoods as Comus florida and C. kousa are currently riding a crest of popular-ity, while peegee hydrangeas, deutzias, lilacs, and spireas are not as highly favored as they once were. Similarly, much atten-tion is now being paid to plants that flower at seasons in which few other trees and shrubs are in bloom; for example, the Stewartia species and the new hybrid crape myrtles from the National Arboretum.

60|$|When Pearson and {{his wife}} had thus {{acquired}} all the rights over Ilbrahim that could be delegated, their affection for him became like the memory of their native land, or their mild sorrow for the dead, a piece of the immovable furniture of their hearts. The boy, also, after a week or two of mental disquiet, began to gratify his protectors by many inadvertent proofs that he considered them as parents, and their house as home. Before the winter snows were melted, the persecuted infant, the little wanderer from a remote and heathen country, seemed native in the New England cottage, and inseparable from the warmth and security of its hearth. Under the influence of kind treatment, and in the consciousness that he was loved, Ilbrahim's demeanor lost a premature manliness, which had resulted from his earlier situation; he became more childlike, and his natural character displayed itself with freedom. It was in many respects a beautiful one, yet the disordered imaginations of both his father and mother had perhaps propagated a certain unhealthiness {{in the mind of the}} boy. In his general state, Ilbrahim would derive enjoyment from the most trifling events, and from every object about him; he seemed to discover rich treasures of happiness, by a faculty analogous to that of the <b>witch</b> <b>hazel,</b> which points to hidden gold where all is barren to the eye. His airy gayety, coming to him from a thousand sources, communicated itself to the family, and Ilbrahim was like a domesticated sunbeam, brightening moody countenances, and chasing away the gloom from the dark corners of the cottage.|$|E
