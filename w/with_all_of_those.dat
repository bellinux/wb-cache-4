40|$|Object {{tracking}} is {{a challenging}} problems in real-time computer vision due to variations of lighting condition, pose, scale, and view-point over time. However, it is exceptionally difficult to model appearance <b>with</b> respect to <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> variations in advance; instead, on-line update algorithms are employed {{to adapt to}} these changes.

This technique provides accurate and compact representations using Gaussian mixtures, in which the number of Gaussians is automatically determined. This procedure is performed in linear time at each time step, which we prove by amortized analysis. Features for each pixel and rectangular region are modeled together by the proposed sequential density approximation algorithm, and the target model is updated in scale robustly. We show the performance of our method by simulations and tracking in natural videos...|$|R
