5|$|It's {{strange to}} hear Uncle Tupelo {{mentioned}} because <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> doing {{was in such}} a long line of musical history. People are wrong in starting with us and saying we started anything because we were just picking up the ball, starting with Woody Guthrie and on to the early '60s and the Flying Burrito Brothers that we were influenced by. We didn't start a genre. We contributed to a long line of fairly good music. That's the way we looked at it at the time—doing what was right for the song.|$|E
25|$|After {{having worked}} {{with members of}} 27 as guest musicians on {{previous}} full-length Oceanic, for Panopticon Isis turned to Justin Chancellor, bassist of tour-mates Tool. According to Turner, “he {{was one of the}} first names on the list. He's in a band that we all mutually respect and we felt like he was a person that understood <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> doing and could maintain a focus on <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> trying to attain. But he also has some interesting facets of his own musical personality that we thought would blend well with our style.” Wavering Radiant, Isis' 2009 final album, features Adam Jones, also of Tool, as a guest musician.|$|E
25|$|I {{think we}} were all pretty naive about what we, <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> achieving—we were having too much fun to get kind of caught up. We'd just {{released}} our second album overseas on an independent label; and, spent time in America as an independent act. And that was around about the time where we started our own label, just to, um, release, maybe, release a few, some bands of friends of ours, in bands.|$|E

25|$|Yesterday I {{stood at}} Arlington National Cemetery {{attending}} {{the funeral of}} a young Marine in my district. He believed in <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> doing {{is the right thing}} and had the courage to lay his life on the line to do it. A few minutes ago I received a call from Colonel Danny Bubp, Ohio Representative from the 88th district in the House of Representatives. He asked me to send Congress a message: Stay the course. He also asked me to send Congressman Murtha a message, that cowards cut and run, Marines never do. Danny and the rest of America and the world want the assurance from this body—that we will see this through.|$|E

500|$|Lennon later {{retracted}} many of {{the comments}} he made in that era, attributing them to his anger. He subsequently spoke with great affection and fondness for Martin.

500|$|The {{album was}} {{received}} poorly {{and failed to}} chart or improve Powderfinger's platform despite the respectable success of its predecessor, Transfusion. Critics complained about its poor imitation of Americana and grunge, {{as well as its}} overuse of complex riffs. In a 2004 interview, Powderfinger lead singer Bernard Fanning said, in reference to the album, [...] "God knows <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> on then." [...] Three singles were released from the album, all of which failed to chart.|$|E

He came 12th out of 26 candidates, with 110 votes (0.46%), resulting in a lost deposit. He explained that he was standing because [...] "if we don't face this now {{we are going to have}} some serious explaining to do when we are asked by our children and grandchildren <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> doing when the global fascist state was installed.

500|$|We'd {{just got}} {{ourselves}} a sampler, {{and we went}} sample-crazy.

When we put that record out, we knew <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> doing was illegal, but {{we thought it was}} gonna be such an underground record, nobody would ever hear about it.

[...] The Ferrari drivers expressed no opinion in the matter, leaving the decision to Todt, who was not present.

He also said that in making Parables for Wooden Ears, Powderfinger [...] "went through this weird stage of trying to be something [...] weren't." [...] Fanning also told Australian Musician that the album, a [...] "spectacular failure", was a result of the band feeling [...] "forced" [...] to play like other bands that were popular in Brisbane at the time.|$|E
500|$|Work on {{the album}} was {{interrupted}} by the recording of [...] "Spectre", which Radiohead wrote for the James Bond film of the same name.

500|$|After a month-long halt in the Grytviken whaling station, Endurance {{departed}} for the Antarctic on 5 December. Two days later Shackleton was disconcerted to encounter pack ice {{as far north}} as 57°26′S, forcing the ship to manoeuvre. [...] During the following days there were more tussles with the pack, which on 14 December was thick enough to halt the ship for 24hours. [...] Three days later the ship was stopped again. Shackleton commented: [...] "I had been prepared for evil conditions in the Weddell Sea, but had hoped that the pack would be loose. <b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> encountering was fairly dense pack of a very obstinate character".|$|E
500|$|Anders Jakobson, their drummer, {{reported}} that [...] "It was {{all these different}} types of people who enjoyed <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> doing.

[...] Other Swedish groups, such as General Surgery and Regurgitate, practiced goregrind. Inhume, from the Netherlands, Rotten Sound, from Finland, and Leng Tch'e, from Belgium, were subsequent European groups who practiced grindcore with death metal inflections. In 2000s, the Belgium-based Aborted [...] "had grown into the role of key contributors to the death-grind genres".|$|E

[...] Lennon described his working arrangement with Ono and Spector: [...] "Phil doesn't arrange or anything like that— and Phil will just sit in the other room and shout comments like, 'Why don't you try this sound' or 'You're not playing the piano too well'...
