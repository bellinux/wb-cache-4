[...] He told NPR: [...] "The term new journalism became very fashionable on college campuses in the 1970s {{and some of its}} {{practitioners}} tended to be a little loose with the facts. [...] And that's <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to part company.

500|$|The stage show {{celebrated its}} fifth anniversary of {{appearing}} {{on stage in}} October 2013. That month a cable television series based upon the show entitled Criss Angel BeLIEve was broadcast on Spike TV. The first season included eleven one-hour episodes, including 118 different illusions. Guests on the show include Ludacris, Ice-T, Randy Couture and Shaquille O’Neal. When asked about the three years between the last episode of Mindfreak and his return to television, Angel stated that, [...] "I didn’t take long at all {{to go back to}} television. It was my choice to work on the live Cirque show and to get that <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> it to be.|$|E

[...] Following tradition, Pritchard picked her up and threw her into the river. Oxford's Jones remarked [...] "we were as well prepared as last year but we found no magic."

Tamera had tried out for the role previously; she {{said that it was}} common for them to read for the same part, but emphasized that [...] " [...] very different actors". When she saw the two women together, Brock Akil initially debated whether they would be appropriate for the show's tone. She was concerned about the sisters' wholesome image gained from their years as child actors on the sitcom Sister, Sister, explaining, [...] "I had a certain image of them.

500|$|Beauregard sent a {{telegram}} to President Davis announcing a complete victory. He later admitted, [...] "I thought I had Grant just <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> him and could finish {{him up in}} the morning." [...] Many of his men were jubilant, having overrun the Union camps and taken thousands of prisoners and tons of supplies. Grant still had reason to be optimistic: Lew Wallace's 5,800 men (minus the two regiments guarding the supplies at Crump's Landing) and 15,000 of Don Carlos Buell's army began to arrive that evening. Wallace's division took up a position on the right of the Union line and was in place by 1 a.m.; Buell's men were fully on the scene by 4 a.m., in time to turn the tide the next day.|$|E
500|$|Volk {{enrolled}} at the University of Michigan in 1963. His decision to attend Michigan rather than Ohio State was influenced by family ties, including Bob Chappuis, who was Volk's uncle and {{finished second in the}} Heisman Trophy voting while playing for the undefeated 1947 Wolverines. Volk noted:"I had all these stories growing up. He [...] was my hero, so I always wanted to go to Michigan. ... And I didn't like Woody [...] anyway. It was just my Grandpa telling me because he didn't like Woody, and he hoped Woody would choke on his Thanksgiving turkey. ... Because of Uncle Bob going to Michigan, that's <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to go. You know, I loved the helmets, loved the uniforms. I said 'Hey, if I could just sit on the bench, that's all I care about.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Introspection {{was also}} listed {{as one of}} the {{foundational}} themes prevalent on the album, along with [...] "genuine statements of personal and careerist reflection scattered among the posturing of 'Bitch I'm Madonna' and 'Unapologetic Bitch'" [...] according to Slant Magazines Sam C. Mac as well as her [...] "obsessive self-regard". Madonna explained to Jon Pareles of The New York Times that although she has never looked back at her past endeavors, reminiscing about it felt right for Rebel Heart. [...] "And it's bittersweet for me to think about that. It just seemed like a time <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to stop and look back. It's kind of like survivor guilt. How did I make it and they didn't?" [...] During the album's development phase, she became comfortable expressing her ideas in front of a few people, comparing it to: [...] "writing your diary in front of somebody and reading it out loud... It was almost like an acting exercise, you know, just putting myself in a room and letting ideas flow even if I didn't feel so connected to the people".|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} four stars, calling it [...] "one of those rare movies <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to sit in the}} front row and let the images wash out to the edges of my field of vision". Broadway star Nathan Lane, who was the voice of Timon the meerkat in The Lion King, has said Finding Nemo was his {{favorite}} animated film. Ed Park of The Village Voice gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "It's an ocean of eye candy that tastes fresh even in this ADD-addled era of SpongeBob SquarePants." [...] Mark Caro of the Chicago Tribune gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "You connect to these sea creatures as you rarely do with humans in big-screen adventures. The result: a true sunken treasure." [...] Hazel-Dawn Dumpert of L.A. Weekly gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "As gorgeous a film as Disney's ever put out, with astonishing qualities of light, movement, surface and color at the service of the best professional imaginations money can buy." [...] Jeff Strickler of the Star Tribune gave the film a positive review, saying it [...] "proves that even when Pixar is not at the top of its game, it still produces better animation than some of its competitors on their best days." [...] Gene Seymour of Newsday gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "The underwater backdrops take your breath away. No, really. They're so lifelike, you almost feel like holding your breath while watching." [...] Rene Rodriguez of the Miami Herald gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "Parental anxiety may not be the kind of stuff children's films are usually made of, but this perfectly enchanting movie knows how to cater to its kiddie audience without condescending to them." ...|$|E

He relates that he lasted {{only a few weeks}} because, [...] "the new immigrants were given the worst of everything…the food was the same, but that was the only thing everyone had in common.

2500|$|Multiple critics {{praised the}} game's dark humor. David Sanchez, {{reviewer}} for GameZone, stated [...] "the little blue Swarmites are completely stupid, {{and they have}} a ridiculous charm to them that makes you want to see them meet their demise." [...] Sanchez further noted that seeing the swarmites die was [...] "strangely satisfying and totally hilarious." [...] IGN's Colin Moriarty called the swarmite deaths [...] "saddening and necessary," [...] but added that players will [...] "never grow tired of seeing it happen." [...] Ben Reeves of Game Informer also enjoyed the game's humor, but felt that there was not enough variety to keep a player's interest. [...] "It may be fun to watch these little guys die, but there were too many moments <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to kill the power to my console." ...|$|E
2500|$|Born in Montevideo, Uruguay in 1976, Hendler {{was raised}} in the {{neighborhood}} of Buceo, and also lived in Pocitos, and Cordón. He grew up in a family of Jewish heritage; his father was a merchant and his mother a keen theatergoer. During his youth, Hendler used to play basketball in Hebraica and soccer. He attended the primary Colegio Integral, Hendler said, [...] "I studied in a Jewish school and I feel I went through a phase <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to distance from that environment, to discern better what I was surrounded with, what I wanted to choose and what I didn't from that set of values." [...] Atypically, he had two bar mitzvah ceremonies because his parents were separated since he was five years old. While he's Jewish, he's not religious or believe in God. At 14 he began doing theater with some friends.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, after {{pulling the}} band {{off the road}} mid-tour, Ward said he needed to re-group. [...] "I walked {{out in the middle}} of a tour.... I needed to get away from {{everything}} and everyone. I wasn't enjoying myself at all, and I didn't feel my life or the band was <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> it to be... I needed to step back and reassess everything." [...] For two months, he retreated to his home without speaking to anyone in his professional life. In an article with PE.com, Ward said, [...] "When I left, I honestly didn't know if I was going to continue the band or not, so I told everyone to pursue whatever they wanted,". During that time, Hinojos left to join The Mars Volta as their new secondary guitarist and sound manipulator, filling the void left by Jeremy Ward's death. Hinojos was replaced by Keeley Davis.|$|E

2500|$|Debney called Iron Man 2 [...] "odd in {{that there}} were {{not a lot of}} places where a true superhero theme could be played. Tony Stark is uber cool even as Iron Man, so, musically, we couldn’t state a {{full-blown}} superhero theme. The strains of Iron Man’s theme are heard only in a few spots by design. I’m hoping with future films, Iron Man might get his full-blown theme played aggressively." [...] For instance, Debney recorded several different versions of the score for scenes where Stark puts on the Iron Man suit, each with [...] "different portions of the theme fleshed out or left out". What was ultimately chosen [...] "was less thematic. It was sort of a groove {{with a little bit of}} French horn. Maybe that was the right choice, but it was a difficult decision. It was difficult to find the areas in the movie where we could let Tony be a superhero." [...] He continued, [...] "There were moments <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to play a scene broadly or make a love scene out of it but we were never able to go there", such as for the end of the film where [...] "Tony finally kisses Pepper ... there were a couple of versions I did that were really gorgeous and lush but it just didn't fit. It's a different kind of movie because they kiss and then all of a sudden the mood is broken. It's just the nature of this character." [...] Debney felt that this process led to the score being [...] "watered down and mashed up a little bit" [...] from what he originally intended. However, Debney did not feel the same about his music for the villain, Ivan Vanko, which he described as a personal [...] "joy". He said that Favreau [...] "gave me a great opportunity to get into [...] scene and learn 's circumstances and to play sincerely sad music for him and the relationship he had with his father. Jon gave me the opportunity to morph that and turn it into something really dark and twisted. For me that was the most satisfactory part of the score and the film". For Vanko's theme, the choir sang in Russian to [...] "capture the dark Russian soul" [...] of the character.|$|E
