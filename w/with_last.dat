5|$|As <b>with</b> <b>last</b> season's event, {{the final}} was {{scheduled}} {{before the end}} of the domestic season. This was partly because the Premier League chose to end its campaign a week later, but with the World Cup starting on 31 May, the FA wanted to give players considerable time to prepare for the finals. This season's staging of the competition offered a greater financial incentive to clubs, given the BBC and Sky Sports signed a joint-deal with the FA, worth £400 million to broadcast matches. Finalists stood to receive £1 million in prize money; the winners would pocket an extra million with additional TV revenues. The BBC spent a million promoting the FA Cup, and as part of their pre-match coverage included a sketch featuring Ricky Gervais. Seat prices for the final exceeded £70, with some ticket touts charging as much as £600 outside the stadium.|$|E

25|$|A rare lunchtime {{kick-off}} was {{the scene}} of Napoli's visit to the Tardini, just the second home game the Crociati had had in a run of seven. Napoli had won four in a row before this game, but they were dominated by an impressive Parma performance. Gianluca Musacci, however, appear to have tripped Edison Cavani in the penalty area late on in the second half, although replays suggested that Cavani tripped over his feet. He picked himself up to take the penalty, had it saved by Mirante, but was quickest to react to poke it home to give Napoli the lead. The parallels <b>with</b> <b>last</b> week's penalty against Genoa were strong: the referee's decision was questionable and Mirante saved, but could only push it into the taker's path. Parma continued to dominate in the second half and should have had a penalty for an Andrea Dossena handball, but eventually scored through Cristian Zaccardo's tap-in with not long left to go. As Parma pressed for the winner, Napoli broke and Ezequiel Lavezzi scored, although replays suggest he was offside.|$|E
