An inquiry was held by ACMA in November 2010 into the situation, which found that apart from some disturbance to ABC2 signals, TV and radio signals in the area were of acceptable strength and quality.|$|E
5|$|When the October journées took place, France's revolutionary decade, 1789–1799, {{had barely}} begun. The revolution's {{capacity}} for violence was as yet not fully realized. The storming of the Bastille had occurred {{less than three}} months earlier. Flush with newly discovered power, the common citizens of France – particularly in the teeming capital, Paris – felt a newly discovered desire to participate in politics and government. The poorest among them were almost exclusively concerned <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of food: most workers spent nearly half their income on bread. In the post-Bastille period, price inflation and severe shortages in Paris became commonplace, as did local incidents of violence in the marketplaces.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with getting}} the motor patented, Peck and Brown {{arranged}} {{to get the}} motor publicized, starting with independent testing to verify it was a functional improvement, followed by press releases sent to technical publications for articles to run concurrent <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of the patent. Physicist William Arnold Anthony (who tested the motor) and Electrical World magazine editor Thomas Commerford Martin arranged for Tesla to demonstrate his alternating current motor on 16 May 1888 at the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. Engineers working for the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company reported to George Westinghouse that Tesla had a viable AC motor and related power system — something Westinghouse needed for the alternating current system he was already marketing. Westinghouse looked into getting a patent on a similar commutator-less, rotating magnetic field-based induction motor developed in 1885 and presented in a paper in March 1888 by Italian physicist Galileo Ferraris, but decided that Tesla's patent would probably control the market.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} {{campaign}} against the Catholic Church, hundreds of monasteries in Germany and Austria were confiscated by the Gestapo and their occupants were expelled. In 1941 the Catholic Bishop of Münster, August von Galen, publicly protested against this persecution and against Action T4, the Nazi non-voluntary euthanasia programme under which the mentally ill, physically deformed, and incurably sick were to be killed. In a series of sermons that received international attention, he criticised the programme as illegal and immoral. His sermons led to a widespread protest movement among church leaders, the strongest protest against a Nazi policy up until that point. Bormann and others called for Galen to be hanged, but Hitler and Goebbels concluded that Galen's death would only {{be viewed as a}} martyrdom and lead to further unrest. Hitler decided to deal <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> when the war was over.|$|E
5|$|Country singer Taylor Swift's Fearless had {{the longest}} run among the {{releases}} that have reached peak position in 2008, spending 11 non-consecutive weeks beginning <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> dated November 29 and continuing into the 2009 chart year. She {{is the only}} singer to have achieved the longest-running album as a country female recording act in the Billboard200 history. Swift is now ranked fifth {{on the list of}} solo female artists with the longest-running number-one album in Billboard history, tied with veterans Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston. Other albums with extended chart runs include Jack Johnson's fifth studio album, Sleep Through the Static, and Metallica's ninth studio album, Death Magnetic; each spent three straight weeks on the chart. Three soundtrack albums topped the chart in 2008: Juno, Mamma Mia! and Twilight.|$|E
5|$|Debate {{on church}} {{officers}} began on 19 October. The Assembly began <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of ordination, {{as many of}} the divines were concerned about the rise of various sectarian movements and the lack of any mechanism for ordination of ministers of the established church. While some members did not seem to think ordination necessary for preachers (though they should not administer the sacraments without it), a majority of the divines thought any regular preaching without ordination unacceptable and wished to erect a provisional presbytery for purposes of ordination. There was also debate at this early stage over the nature of the visible church. The congregationalists considered a church to be a single local congregation, while the majority considered the national church to be a unity and were alarmed at the prospect of a disintegrated English church. Despite these debates, up until the end of 1643 there was hope that a common church government could be framed that would be satisfactory to all parties involved.|$|E

They argue, and he states that if Gwen is working to safeguard ordinary life then she has not been successful. Returning to Torchwood's headquarters, Gwen interrupts Jack and fellow Torchwood employee Ianto (Gareth David-Lloyd) during a sexual encounter. After apologising, she tells Jack that she wants to continue the investigation. Jack refuses to help, but Ianto later gives Gwen a GPS device with coordinates to a hidden location, leading Gwen to a facility on Flat Holm, a sort of care home for seventeen individuals taken by the riftwho have returned. Gwen finds Jack there, and demands access to Jonah. An older Jonah (Robert Pugh) is shown to have been physically deformed whilst on a burning planet {{in the midst of a}} burning solar system. Jack reveals that he set up the facility when he first took command of Torchwood, in order to care for the victims of the rift, who had previously been locked away in the Torchwood vaults.|$|E
5|$|In 1964 he and Kenneth Adam {{initiated}} the new anthology series The Wednesday Play, a BBC equivalent of Armchair Theatre, which had great success and critical acclaim with plays {{written and directed}} by the likes of Dennis Potter, Jeremy Sandford and Ken Loach. The strand attracted comment and debate for several of its productions, such as Cathy Come Home, a Tony Garnett production of a Jeremy Sandford script, which dealt <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of homelessness. There were also problems caused by Newman bringing in freelance directors to work on the programme, who sometimes overspent on their plays to try and increase their impact; with staff directors this could be compensated by reducing the budget of a subsequent production, but for a freelancer there would be no such recourse.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{the city}} has {{experienced}} steady population growth, and has been faced <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of accommodating more residents. In 2006, after growing by 4,000citizens per year for the previous 16 years, regional planners expected the population of Seattle to grow by 200,000people by2040. However, former mayor Greg Nickels supported plans that would increase the population by 60%, or 350,000people, by 2040 and worked on ways to accommodate this growth while keeping Seattle's single-family housing zoning laws. The Seattle City Council later voted to relax height limits on buildings in {{the greater part of}} Downtown, partly with the aim to increase residential density in the city center. As a sign of increasing inner-city growth, the downtown population crested to over 60,000 in 2009, up 77% since 1990.|$|E
