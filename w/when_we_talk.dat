25|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> about a {{permanent}} vegetative state, I am offended by that. Terri smiles and acknowledges {{the people that}} love her {{when they come to}} see her. She cries when they leave. How heartless are we to call somebody like Terri Schiavo a vegetable? What are we thinking?When we think about this case, we need to think about the message that we are sending to our children and our grandchildren. What we do in this Chamber tonight is as important as anything we have done in defending our Nation, in doing the things that we do as Members of Congress.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Murakami {{published}} the anthology Birthday Stories, which collects short {{stories on the}} theme of birthdays. The collection includes work by Russell Banks, Ethan Canin, Raymond Carver, David Foster Wallace, Denis Johnson, Claire Keegan, Andrea Lee, Daniel Lyons, Lynda Sexson, Paul Theroux, and William Trevor, as well as a story by Murakami himself. What I Talk About When I Talk About Running, containing tales about his experience as a marathon runner and a triathlete, was published in Japan in 2007, with English translations released in the U.K. and the U.S. in 2008. The title is a play on that of Raymond Carver's short story collection, What We Talk About <b>When</b> <b>We</b> <b>Talk</b> About Love.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Iran's Press TV (which was subsequently posted online on 11 April 2013), Choudary stated [...] "As Muslims, we reject democracy, we reject secularism, and freedom, and human rights. We reject {{all of the things}} that you espouse as being ideals ... There is nothing called a republic in Islam. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> about the shari'a, we are talking about only the shari'a. We are talking about rejecting the U.N., the IMF, and the World Bank." ...|$|E
500|$|Goffman’s {{key idea}} is that most {{conversation}} is simply a replaying of a strip – {{what he describes as}} a personal experience or event. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> with others, the speaker’s goal is often always the same, to provide “evidence for the fairness or unfairness of his current situation and other grounds for sympathy, approval, exoneration, understanding, or amusement. And what his listeners are primarily obliged to do is to show some kind of audience appreciation." [...] Essentially, through interaction, we are only looking to be heard, not inspire any kind of action but simply to know that someone listened and understood. This is why often a simple head nod or grunt is accepted as an appropriate response in conversation.|$|E
500|$|Masuda {{considers}} the starter Pokémon {{to be among}} the most important in the franchise; Yoshida goes further and calls them [...] "the face of that generation" [...] and says that [...] "they're the ones that should be on the packaging". The three starter Pokémon of each generation are Grass-, Water-, and Fire-types, a trio that Masuda considers to be the easiest to understand for new players. In an interview with GamesRadar in 2009, Masuda stated that simple Pokémon take around six months to design and develop, whereas Pokémon that play a more important part in the games (such as starter Pokémon) may take over a year. Masuda added, [...] "We also want the designer to have as much freedom as possible, we don't want to narrow down their imagination by saying 'We want this kind of Pokemon.' <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> to the designer we always stress that they shouldn't think of Pokemon necessarily, but should instead just be as creative as they can." [...] After the Pokémon is designed it is sent to the [...] "Battle Producer", who decides which moves and stats the Pokémon should have.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is so," [...] Jim agreed; [...] "but {{you know}} <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> it over <b>we</b> {{were all of}} opinion that he carried us off only to act as hostages for himself." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You do not think, father," [...] Chebron said hesitatingly, [...] "that {{the plot}} {{could have been}} to murder Neco? This is what Amuba and I thought <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> it over this afternoon." ...|$|R

2500|$|Gingrich {{had been}} criticized for {{opposing}} same-sex marriage while having been married three times and divorced twice. Representative Barney Frank (D-Mass) said he looks [...] "forward to debating, to take one important example, the Defense of Marriage Act with Mr. Gingrich. I think he is an ideal opponent for us, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> about just who it is, is threatening the sanctity of marriage." ...|$|E
2500|$|Riggan Thomson is a faded American {{actor who}} {{is famous for}} playing the superhero Birdman in a film trilogy 20 years ago. He is tormented by the mocking and {{critical}} internal voice of Birdman and is frequently shown performing feats of levitation and telekinesis. Riggan is trying to gain recognition as a serious actor for writing, directing, and starring in a Broadway adaptation of Raymond Carver's short story [...] "What We Talk About <b>When</b> <b>We</b> <b>Talk</b> About Love." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{must not}} be in a hurry," [...] said my wife <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> of these matters. [...] "When he gets more {{accustomed}} to these things he will be more surprised at them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] says Mr. Draper, {{eyeing the}} young man, [...] "I {{was with her}} ladyship yesterday, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> over the whole of this here most unpleasant--I won't say as you do, disgraceful business." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, but, my dear,' says he, 'what {{can you say}} to him? You know, as {{you said}} <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> of it before, he well ask you many {{questions}} about it, and all the house will wonder what the meaning of it should be.' ...|$|R
2500|$|In 2015, Airbus Group {{said it was}} {{establishing}} a R center and venture capital fund in Silicon Valley. Airbus CEO Fabrice Bregier stated: [...] "What is the weakness of a big group like Airbus <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> about innovation? We {{believe that we have}} better ideas {{than the rest of the}} world. We believe that we know because we control the technologies and platforms. The world has shown us in the car industry, the space industry and the hi-tech industry that this is not true. And we need to be open to others' ideas and others' innovations," ...|$|E
2500|$|Hume famously remarked that, [...] "We speak not {{strictly}} and philosophically <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> of the combat {{of passion and}} of reason. Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them." [...] Hume also took his definition of reason to unorthodox extremes by arguing, unlike his predecessors, that human reason is not qualitatively different from either simply conceiving individual ideas, or from judgments associating two ideas, and that [...] "reason {{is nothing but a}} wonderful and unintelligible instinct in our souls, which carries us along a certain train of ideas, and endows them with particular qualities, according to their particular situations and relations." [...] It followed from this that animals have reason, only much less complex than human reason.|$|E
2500|$|The {{essential}} {{point of}} this exercise is often missed. Wittgenstein's point {{is not that it}} is impossible to define [...] "game", but that we don't have a definition, and we don't need one, because even without the definition, we use the word successfully. Everybody understands what we mean <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> about playing a game, and we can even clearly identify and correct inaccurate uses of the word, all without reference to any definition that consists of necessary and sufficient conditions for the application of the concept of a game. The German word for [...] "game", [...] "", has a different sense than in English; the meaning of [...] "Spiele" [...] also extends to the concept of [...] "play" [...] and [...] "playing." [...] This German sense of the word may help readers better understand Wittgenstein's context in the remarks regarding games.|$|E

I thought you knew him too, mother; I never guessed that your mind was running on Schlangenwald <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> at cross purposes last night." ...|$|R
3000|$|So <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> {{about the}} differences, <b>we</b> {{actually}} <b>talked</b> about {{the factors that}} cause maintenance or decline of the task, actually. But we did not call them factors, but you started to call them factors about what causes maintenance or decline. So, let’s call them factors associated with maintenance or decline… [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, madam," [...] said he, [...] "these be {{the very}} {{arguments}} I used t'other day <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> of this; and all you answered me then was to call me a dull-witted clod, for not seeing how the thing might be done without involving my lord." ...|$|R
2500|$|A {{comparative}} analysis of polling data {{of support for}} same-sex marriage in Australia and membership demographics of the SDA found that the socially conservative positions of the SDA leadership - particularly de Bruyn - {{are likely to be}} at odds with the rank-and-file of the union. The lobby group Australian Marriage Equality challenged the SDA to survey its membership before contributing further to the same-sex marriage debate in Australia. In response to a 2014 poll with 72 percent support for same-sex marriage, de Bruyn dismissed the figures but refused to poll his members on the issue. He says he [...] "knows they agree with him absolutely. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> to our members about out these things they agree with us". Some SDA-aligned Labor MPs do not agree with the SDA's stance on same-sex marriage and in fact support same-sex marriage in defiance of the SDA, some South Australian examples being Kate Ellis, Amanda Rishworth and Nick Champion.|$|E
2500|$|Water is {{the primary}} source of {{hydrogen}} to all living organisms, so the isotopic composition of environmental water is a first-order control on that of the biosphere. The hydrological cycle moves water around different reservoirs {{on the surface of the}} earth, during which hydrogen isotopes in water are significantly fractionated. [...] As the primary moisture source to the atmosphere, the ocean has a relatively uniform hydrogen isotope composition across the globe around 0‰ (VSMOW). Variations of δD larger than 10‰ in the ocean are generally confined to surface waters due to evaporation, sea ice formation, and addition of meteoric waters by precipitation, rivers or icebergs. In the hydrological cycle, the two major processes that fractionate hydrogen isotopes from ocean water are evaporation and condensation. It should be pointed out that oxygen isotopic composition (18O/16O) of water is also an important tracer in the hydrological cycle, and cannot be separated from hydrogen isotopes <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> about isotope fractionation processes associated with water.|$|E
2500|$|The {{personal}} and vocational {{experiences of the}} four co-writers were central to writing the script. Dinelaris' exposure to Broadway shaped the depictions of rehearsals and events backstage, though he admitted exaggerating these. He also felt his background writing long scenes of dialogue helped since scenes in the film [...] "were really more like play scenes". Iñárritu's own experiences influenced many of Birdmans themes. [...] "What this film talks about, I have been through," [...] Iñárritu recalled. [...] "I have seen and experienced all of it; it's what I have been living through {{the last years of}} my life." [...] Dinelaris described this aspect as [...] "a laughing look at oneself", but said {{it had to be done}} in a comedic way otherwise [...] "it would have been the most unbelievably self-absorbed look at the subject". Themes from Raymond Carver's short story [...] "What We Talk About <b>When</b> <b>We</b> <b>Talk</b> About Love", which Riggan adapts for stage in the story, also influenced the script. Iñárritu wanted to find the connection between the themes in Riggan's story and those of Carver's. Because of this, it was important to the director that Carver's story be the subject of the play depicted within the film. Therefore, Iñárritu stated that his desire to use Carver's work was [...] "terrifying" [...] because the rights to using the Carver material were still subject to the possibility of being rejected during development of the film, but no issues arose. Carver's widow, writer Tess Gallagher, loved the script and permitted the adaptation, saying that Carver would be laughing about the film.|$|E

'Back then, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> on the phone, Kevin {{asked if}} I thought his England career had {{ended in the}} right manner {{following}} the last Ashes series in Australia.

6000|$|Nothing can {{surpass the}} respect paid to Longfellow here, from the Queen downward. He is {{everywhere}} received and courted, and finds (as I {{told him he}} would, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> of it in Boston) the working-men at least as well acquainted with his books as the classes socially above them.

6000|$|... "You see, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> rations here, Marjorie, it's ourselves, but <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> {{religion}}--it's mankind. You've either {{got to be}} Everyman {{in religion}} or leave it alone. That's my idea. It's no more presumptuous to think for the race {{than it is for}} a beggar to pray--though that means going right up to God and talking to Him. Salvation's a collective thing and a mystical thing--or there isn't any. Fancy the Almighty and me sitting up and keeping Eternity together! God and R. A. G. Trafford, F.R.S.--that's silly. Fancy a man in number seven boots, and a tailor-made suit in the nineteen-fourteen fashion, sitting before God! That's caricature. But God and Man! That's sense, Marjorie."...|$|E
