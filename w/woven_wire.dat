2500|$|Though {{excluding}} birds {{from the}} entire airport environment is virtually impossible, {{it is possible to}} exclude deer and other mammals that constitute a small percentage of wildlife strikes. [...] Three meter high fences made of chain link or <b>woven</b> <b>wire,</b> with barbed wire outriggers, are the most effective. When used as a perimeter fence, these fences also serve to keep unauthorized persons off of the airport (Seamans 2001). Realistically every fence must have gates. Gates that are left open allow deer and other mammals onto the airport. 4.6 meter long cattle guards {{have been shown to be}} effective at deterring deer up to 98% of the time (Belant et al. 1998).|$|E

2500|$|The {{perimeter}} {{foundation and}} exterior walls {{are made of}} rough-cut Bowlby stone, a type of volcanic tuff. [...] The gray-brown stone was locally quarried. [...] The stone walls are true load-bearing walls. [...] There are stone arches above the windows and main entry doors. [...] The arch keystones and window sills are light gray granite. [...] The courthouse windows are double-hung, one-over-one style in wooden frames. They are arranged in pairs and symmetrically placed {{on all sides of}} the building. Some of the original wooden sashes have been replaced by modern vinyl sashes; however, the frames are still intact. [...] In the 1970s, aluminum storm windows were mounted over all the windows. [...] Five first floor windows at the southeast corner of the building have steel bars and are covered with <b>woven</b> <b>wire</b> mesh. [...] This is the exterior of the men's jail.

2500|$|Woven {{mesh wire}} is safer but more {{expensive}} than strands of smooth wire. [...] It {{is more difficult to}} install, and has some visibility issues, but horses are less likely to become tangled in it or be injured if they run into it. [...] Adding a top rail of wood or synthetic material increases visibility of the fence and prevents it from being bent by horses reaching over it. [...] A strand of electric fence may also keep horses from pushing on a mesh fence. [...] Mesh fencing needs to be heavy-gauge wire, woven, not welded, and the squares of the mesh should be too small for a horse to put a foot through. [...] "Field fence" [...] or [...] "no-climb" [...] fence are safer designs than more widely woven [...] "sheep fence." [...] Chain link fence is occasionally seen, but horses can bend chain link almost as easily as a thinner-gauge wire, so the additional expense is often not justified by any gain over good-quality <b>woven</b> <b>wire.</b>|$|E

30|$|Ordered ZnO {{nanosheet}} arrays {{were grown}} on <b>weaved</b> titanium <b>wires</b> by a low-temperature hydrothermal method. CdS nanoparticles were deposited onto the ZnO nanosheet arrays using the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction method {{to make a}} photoanode. Nanoparticle-sensitized solar cells were assembled using these CdS/ZnO nanostructured photoanodes, and their photovoltaic performance was studied systematically. The best light-to-electricity conversion efficiency was obtained to be 2.17 % under 100  mW/cm 2 illumination, and a remarkable short-circuit photocurrent density of approximately 20.1  mA/cm 2 was recorded, which could attribute to the relatively direct pathways for transportation of electrons provided by ZnO nanosheet arrays {{as well as the}} direct contact between ZnO and <b>weaved</b> titanium <b>wires.</b> These results indicate that CdS/ZnO nanostructures on <b>weaved</b> titanium <b>wires</b> would open a novel possibility for applications of low-cost solar cells.|$|R
50|$|Chain link fencing is, arguably {{a form of}} <b>woven</b> <b>wire,</b> and is {{occasionally}} {{used for}} some livestock containment. However, due to cost, it is not particularly common for fencing large areas where less-expensive forms of <b>woven</b> <b>wire</b> are equally suitable. When used in small enclosures, it is easily deformed by livestock, resulting in high ongoing maintenance costs.|$|E
50|$|Deer {{and many}} goats can easily jump an {{ordinary}} agricultural fence, and so special fencing {{is needed for}} farming goats or deer, or to keep wild deer out of farmland and gardens. Deer fence is often made of lightweight <b>woven</b> <b>wire</b> netting nearly 2 metres (about six feet) high on lightweight posts, otherwise made like an ordinary <b>woven</b> <b>wire</b> fence.|$|E

30|$|In summary, we have {{prepared}} CdS/ZnO nanostructures on <b>weaved</b> titanium <b>wires</b> by a hydrothermal treatment and a SILAR method. The resultant ZnO nanostructures {{consisted of a}} large number of well-aligned nanosheets, which are oriented vertically to the surface of titanium wires. This open-structured nanosheet array is beneficial to the deposition of CdS nanoparticles. An overall light-to-electricity conversion efficiency of 2.17 % was achieved under 100  mW cm- 2 illumination for the solar cells based on CdS/ZnO nanostructures with 20 CdS SILAR cycles. This results demonstrated that <b>weaved</b> titanium <b>wires</b> could be a valid alternative to classical FTO or ITO substrate with relatively low cost and satisfied internal resistance. In addition, the application of all inorganic semiconductors on <b>weaved</b> titanium <b>wires</b> may act as a novel architecture with lower cost and effective performance for further development of nanoparticle-sensitized solar cells.|$|R

50|$|Traditionally, {{screen cloth}} {{was made with}} metal wires woven with a loom. Today, woven cloth is still widely used {{primarily}} because they are less expensive than other types of screen media. Over the years, different weaving techniques have been developed; either to increase the open area percentage or add wear-life. Slotted opening woven cloth is used where product shape is not a priority and where users need a higher open area percentage. Flat-top woven cloth is used when the consumer wants to increase wear-life. On regular <b>woven</b> <b>wire,</b> the crimps (knuckles on woven wires) wear out faster {{than the rest of}} the cloth resulting in premature breakage. On flat-top <b>woven</b> <b>wire,</b> the cloth wears out equally until half of the wire diameter is worn, resulting in a longer wear life. Unfortunately flat-top <b>woven</b> <b>wire</b> cloth is not widely used because of the lack of crimps that causes a pronounced reduction of passing fines resulting in premature wear of con crushers.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{computational}} approach for designing wire meshes, i. e., freeform surfaces composed of <b>woven</b> <b>wires</b> {{arranged in a}} regular grid. To facilitate shape exploration, we map material properties of wire meshes to the geometric model of Chebyshev nets. This abstraction is exploited to build an efficient optimization scheme. While the theory of Chebyshev nets suggests a highly constrained design space, we show that allowing controlled deviations from the underlying surface provides a rich shape space for design explo- ration. Our algorithm balances globally coupled material constraints with aesthetic and geometric design objectives that can be specified by the user in an interactive design session. In addition to sculptural art, wire meshes represent an innovative medium for industrial ap- plications including composite materials and architectural fa c ̧ ades. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach {{using a variety of}} digital and physical prototypes with a level of shape complexity unobtainable using previous methods...|$|R
