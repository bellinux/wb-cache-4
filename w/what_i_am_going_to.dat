25|$|Lake {{expressed}} interest in renegotiating her deal with Paramount:The studio feels that way about it too. They have indicated {{they are going to}} fuss more about the pictures in which I appear. I think I'll enjoy being fussed about... I want this to be the turning point and I think that it will. I am free and clear of unpleasant characters, unless they are strongly justified. I've had a varied experience playing them and also appearing as heroines. The roles themselves haven't been noteworthy and sometimes not even especially spotlighted, but I think they've all been beneficial in one way or another. From here on there should be a certain pattern of development, and that is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> fight for if necessary, though I don't believe it will be because they are so understanding here at Paramount.|$|E

2500|$|Rubinstein was as {{well known}} during his {{lifetime}} for his sarcasm {{as well as his}} sometimes penetrating insight. [...] During one of Rubinstein's visits to Paris, French pianist Alfred Cortot played the first movement of Beethoven's Appassionata for him. After a long silence, Rubinstein told Cortot, [...] "My boy, don't you ever forget <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> tell you. Beethoven's music must not be studied. It must be reincarnated." [...] Cortot reportedly never forgot those words.|$|E

2500|$|In {{response}} to the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, Nelson expressed remorse that the Democrat's Feinstein Amendment, which made the sale of guns to individuals on the ] illegal, and a Republican proposal to update background checks and to create an alert for law enforcement when an individual on the terrorist watch list, failed to pass the Senate. He stated [...] "What am I {{going to tell the}} community of Orlando that is trying to come together in the healing? Sadly, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have to tell them is that the NRA won again.” Both he and Marco Rubio supported the bills.|$|E

2500|$|The views predominating {{among the}} city's {{politicians}} {{and other leaders}} {{turned out to be}} closer to those of The Stranger than the Times. As mayor Greg Nickels put it, [...] "This is not about music, this is not about a party. This was about a guy who decided {{he was going to kill}} people and he had the firepower to do it." [...] Several city council members spoke up against the [...] "quick fix" [...] mentality inherent in the Times editorial; council member Peter Steinbrueck added he was [...] "really incredulous over young teenaged girls going out all night unsupervised and mixing with much older people," [...] but didn't see that as an issue over the nature of the place where they had socialized. Sandra Williamson, mother of shooting victim Christopher [...] "Deacon" [...] Williamson, announced, [...] "I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure that those raves continue… That is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do for Chris." [...] The Seattle Post-Intelligencer added that [...] "even… former City Attorney Mark Sidran", whom they described as [...] "Seattle's best-known defender of underage dance restrictions," [...] said that [...] "Some tragedies defy any sort of rational response in terms of regulation because they're completely irrational events you can't really predict or prevent." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before leaving, Kelly {{told the}} group that when Fitzpatrick, the Benalla constable, was shot, he was not within 400 miles of Greta. However, he {{admitted}} to stealing 280 horses from Whitty's station and denied that he had committed any other crime. The horses, he stated, were sold to Baumgarten. Kelly showed the group his revolvers, and pointed out one which he had taken from Constable Lonigan, and further stated that he had shot Lonigan with a worn-out, crooked musket, held together with string and 'could shoot around corners'. He asked those present how they would like detectives pointing revolvers at their mothers and sisters, threatening to shoot them {{if they did not}} say where they were. He blamed such treatment for turning him against the law. He said that he had come only to shoot the two policemen, Devine and Richards, calling them worse than any black trackers, especially Richards, whom he intended to shoot immediately. Tarleton remarked that Kelly should not blame Richards for doing his duty. Kelly then replied, [...] "Suppose you had your revolver ready when I came in, would you not have shot me ?" [...] Mr Tarleton replied [...] "Yes." [...] "Well", said Kelly, [...] "that's just <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do with Richards—shoot him before he shoots me." [...] The party then interceded for Richards, but Kelly said, [...] "He must die." [...] Before leaving Ned Kelly remarked that he had made a great blunder which would likely lead to their capture.|$|E
