However, the BAI rejected such funding requests from TG4 in May 2014, so the network stated that they would not be making their début in Malta.

500|$|The game's combat {{was praised}} by most critics. Electronic Gaming Monthlys Crispin Boyer {{described}} {{the game as}} [...] "a thrill ride. And not just 'cause Return of the King unleashes larger hordes of foes than last year's equally slick Two Towers prequel. Many of Return of the Kings levels actually force you to multitask while you hack and slash." [...] PC Gamer UKs Tony Ellis wrote [...] "combat in RotK is superbly satisfying. Your blows connect with a solid, visceral thud you can almost feel." [...] He also noted the variation between levels. Eurogamer's Kristan Reed praised the [...] "subtleties of the combat." [...] In contrast, Game Informers Matthew Kato found the gameplay to be [...] "repetitious", writing [...] "sometimes I got the feeling that I was <b>working</b> <b>harder</b> only to have less fun than in Two Towers." [...] The co-op mode was also praised.|$|E

500|$|Development on Remastered began shortly {{following}} {{the release of}} The Last of Us in June 2013. Though initially under light development, the team began <b>working</b> <b>harder</b> on Remastered {{when they saw the}} demand for it; work on the game's code did not begin until a larger team was introduced to Remastered in February 2014. As development on the original game ended, the programmers expected that the game would be ported to the PlayStation 4, but planning and preparation did not begin until The Last of Us had launched. The team aimed at creating a [...] "true" [...] remaster, maintaining the [...] "same core experience" [...] and not changing any large story or gameplay elements. For the game's frame rate, the team was initially split, with some preferring 30 frames per second rather than 60; when the game was running at the latter, the whole team became convinced. The team that worked on Remastered was significantly smaller than the team for The Last of Us; in particular, the team did not include any designers, which led to various design issues remaining from the original game. Druckmann attributed this to the fact that Remastered was developed as a recreation of the original, altering only technical and graphical aspects.|$|E
500|$|After making three {{separate}} returns in September 2013, September 2014 {{and another in}} February 2015 to commemorate 30 years of EastEnders in EastEnders Live Week, Windsor made an unannounced return to EastEnders in 2016, appearing in the episode broadcast on 15 January. After this, {{it was announced that}} the character was to be killed off, losing her battle with breast cancer. The scenes were filmed in secret in November 2015, following Windsor's personal decision for Peggy to be killed. She said: [...] "Peggy is a character close to my heart but I made the decision a while ago that I need to say goodbye to Peggy once and for all as otherwise she will always be there, urging me to go back and that is something I need to shut the door on. After thinking long and hard about it, I realised that it is time for me and the audience to say our final farewells to the lady who I have loved for many years and I thought that whilst , who I adore, is still in charge I want him {{to be the one to}} oversee it. I am grateful that Dominic has accepted my decision and together, since late last summer, we have been secretly plotting Peggy’s last scenes." [...] Treadwell-Collins said, [...] "when [...] told me her decision back in the summer , we both had a little cry before getting excited about how Peggy Mitchell, the matriarch to end all matriarchs could bid her final farewell to Albert Square. In Peggy Mitchell, Barbara has created one of the greatest ever characters on British television, someone who has become as synonymous with EastEnders as The Queen Vic itself. So this is the end of an EastEnders era. But it is also an opportunity to send Peggy Mitchell out in style in what will be one of the most heartbreaking, uplifting and epic exits an EastEnders character has ever had. We can't wait to have Barbara back at EastEnders, even if it is for the final time. The most professional of professionals on set and off, and a true friend, we have all been <b>working</b> <b>harder</b> than ever to make Barbara and Peggy Mitchell proud." [...] Windsor resumed filming on 21 March 2016.|$|E

[...] Emily Azevedo, who was competing with Katie Eberling and Jones for a spot on the team, said: [...] "I should have been <b>working</b> <b>harder</b> on gaining Twitter followers than gaining muscle mass." [...] Neither Eberling or Azevedo blamed Jones for her selection. United States Bobsled and Skeleton Federation CEO Darrin Steele defended the selection: [...] "I haven't heard anyone making the argument about Lolo not being a better athlete right now, a better brakeman for the team. I don't think I've come across that one time. I've heard a lot about history and all that's nice. But who's going to provide the best results for the U.S. team in Sochi? That's the bottom line. And I'll have that debate with anyone who wants to have it.". The team, ended up in 11th place. Bobsledder Elana Meyers also defended the {{selection of}} Jones.|$|E

However, his joy did not last: On October 1, he went back to Tunis in order to start the year in Sadiki College but {{during the first week of}} November 1913, [...] "the superintendent called me out of class and announced me the death of my mother", Bourguiba stated in 1973.

Squealer quickly assures the animals that the van had been purchased from the knacker by an animal hospital, and the previous owner's signboard had not been repainted. In a subsequent report, Squealer reports sadly to the animals that Boxer died peacefully at the animal hospital; the pigs hold a festival one day after Boxer's death to further praise the glories of Animal Farm and have the animals work harder by taking on Boxer's ways. However, the truth was that Napoleon had engineered the sale of Boxer to the knacker, allowing him and his inner circle to acquire money to buy whisky for themselves. (In 1940s England, one way for farms to make money was to sell large animals to a knacker, who would kill the animal and boil its remains into animal glue.) ...|$|E
