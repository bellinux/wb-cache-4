50|$|<b>Water</b> <b>migration</b> {{influences}} {{the quality of}} stored croissants through two mechanisms. First, as previously stated, water redistributes from gluten to starch {{as a result of}} starch retrogradation. Secondly, during the baking process, a moisture gradient was introduced as a result of heat transfer from the oven to the croissant. In fresh croissants, there is high moisture content on the inside and low moisture content on the outside. During storage, this moisture gradient induces <b>water</b> <b>migration</b> from the inside to the outer crust. On a molecular level, water is lost from the amorphous starch fraction and gluten network. At the same time, water diffuses from the outer crust to the environment, which has less moisture. The result of this redistribution of water is a firming up of the croissant, caused by a decrease in starch plasticity and an increase in gluten network rigidity. Due to the presence of large pores in croissants, moisture is lost to the environment at a faster rate than bread products. As such, croissants generally become harder in texture at a faster rate than breads.|$|E

Even if some existing recommendations demand the installation of materials that are increasingly permeable to vapour, the liquid water absorption coefficient is often neglected. This study analyses the influence of six material parameters, such as the liquid absorption coefficient and vapour diffusion resistance, on the hygrothermal behaviour of an existing brick wall insulated on the inside surface with a Lime-Hemp plaster. A specific methodology is developed combining hygrothermal simulations, sensitivity analysis and an experimental planning method. This reproducible methodology allows recommendations to be proposed to help designers choose an appropriate combination of material parameters. The paper demonstrates that the water liquid absorption coefficients of brick and of insulation have a greater influence than the vapour diffusion resistance of those materials in the studied cases. Water liquid absorption coefficient should thus be one of the parameters systematically considered in the hygrothermal analyses of wall components...|$|R
5000|$|In some {{products}} having {{a relatively high}} initial moisture content, an initial linear reduction of the average product moisture content {{as a function of}} time may be observed for a limited time, often known as a [...] "constant drying rate period". Usually, in this period, it is surface moisture outside individual particles that is being removed. The drying rate during this period is mostly dependent on the rate of heat transfer to the material being dried. Therefore, the maximum achievable drying rate is considered to be heat-transfer limited. If drying is continued, the slope of the curve, the drying rate, becomes less steep (falling rate period) and eventually tends to nearly horizontal at very long times. The product moisture content is then constant at the [...] "equilibrium moisture content", where it is, in practice, in equilibrium with the dehydrating medium. In the falling-rate period, <b>water</b> <b>migration</b> from the product interior to the surface is mostly by molecular diffusion, i,e. the water flux is proportional to the moisture content gradient. This means that water moves from zones with higher moisture content to zones with lower values, a phenomenon explained by the second law of thermodynamics. If water removal is considerable, the products usually undergo shrinkage and deformation, except in a well-designed freeze-drying process. The drying rate in the falling-rate period is controlled by the rate of removal of moisture or solvent from the interior of the solid being dried and is referred to as being [...] "mass-transfer limited". This is widely noticed in hygroscopic products such as fruits and vegetables, where drying occurs in the falling rate period with the constant drying rate period said to be negligible.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Water</b> <b>migration</b> in {{cellular}} solid foods during storage causes loss of crispness. To improve crispness retention, physical {{understanding of}} this process is needed. Mathematical models are suitable tools to gain this physical knowledge. RESULTS: <b>Water</b> <b>migration</b> in cellular solid foods involves migration through both the air cells and the solid matrix. For systems in which the <b>water</b> <b>migration</b> distance is large compared with the cell wall thickness of the solid matrix, the overall water flux through the system is dominated by the flux through the air. For these systems, <b>water</b> <b>migration</b> can be approximated well by a Fickian diffusion model. The effective diffusion coefficient can be expressed in terms of the material properties of the solid matrix (i. e. the density, sorption isotherm and diffusion coefficient of water in the solid matrix) and the morphological properties of the cellular structure (i. e. water vapour permeability and volume fraction of the solid matrix). The water vapour permeability is estimated from finite element method modelling using a simplified model for the cellular structure. CONCLUSION: It is shown that experimentally observed dynamical water profiles of bread rolls that differ in crust permeability are predicted well by the Fickian diffusion model.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, an inter {{principle}} research {{is carried out}} on complex fluid flow and heat transfer, using an innovative technology Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), from the Department of Physics. To enhance heat transfer performance of complex fluid flow, the present work mainly focuses on two different parts, one is the adoption of nanofluid; the other is flow forces analysis through bionic engineering studies on plant <b>water</b> <b>migration</b> system. Nanofluids are attracting considerable attention from both academic and industrial communities. Comparing with conventional pure fluids or solutions, nanofluids have higher thermal conductivity, due to the high {{surface to volume ratio}} of nanoparticle and liquid interface, which exhibits a great potential in enhancing heat transfer performance in various occasions. It is believed that different types and concentrations of nanofluid could strongly affect the thermal performance, and a great number of papers have been published to illustrate the phenomenon. However, none has really focused on the possible concentration change of nanofluid while flowing. Otherwise, the thermal performance of nanofluid flow could never be quantified. In the present work, a novel method to measure the dynamic concentration of nanofluid is proposed, using NMR technology. The experiments were carried out with ferrofluid under different concentration and temperature. A new parameter T 2 * was introduced in the study. T 2 * is a relaxation time of the signals that is released by hydrogen atoms after Radio Frequency (RF). And this signal intensity can be strongly affected by nanofluids. Experiments were carried out to obtain the T 2 * of nanofluid in the pipe. An empirical equation based on T 2 * and temperature was proposed to calculate the concentration of nanoparticles. Then, experiments were carried out with flowing ferrofluid in pipe. The dynamic concentration was calculated with the empirical equation. And with the series of experiment, it is confirmed that the flowing nanofluid consists of an obvious concentration gradient, and thus cause different layers of thermal performance from boundary to central line of a laminar pipe flow. Furthermore, the experiment result also gives out a chance to investigate the mechanism of nanoparticle movement in laminar flow with the concentration gradient along radius. Bionic Engineering is another research field that has been more and more interesting to researches from various fields. Since life has been evolving for over millions of years, many functions in lives has become extremely high efficiency and adaptive. These functions can be very worthy for researchers to study and utilize in industries. For heat transfer in fluid flow, {{it is very important to}} enhance the flow pattern. And thus <b>water</b> <b>migration</b> system in plants become very attractive. Plant can take water from soil up to several metres high. Learning from the <b>water</b> <b>migration</b> process in plants has been attracting interests from scientist for over a hundred years. The <b>water</b> <b>migration</b> in plant stem, especially xylem, involves various driving forces including capillary effect, osmosis effect, Marangoni effect and transpiration effect, etc. This present work mainly focuses on the water transport process within xylem. As xylem system is simplified as micro channel, a mathematic model is presented based on micro channel theory, with critical analysis and simplification. With a simplified micro channel from xylem structure and the calculation using the model of <b>water</b> <b>migration</b> in xylem, the relationship between various forces and <b>water</b> <b>migration</b> velocity is identified. The velocity of <b>water</b> <b>migration</b> within the plant stem is considered as detail as possible using all major forces involved.

The present work proved that the mathematical model should be enough to predict the <b>water</b> <b>migration</b> in plants, and could also be critical for future water transport prediction in complex fluid flow in industry applications such as heat pipe...|$|E
40|$|Subduction of oceanic {{lithosphere}} brings {{water into}} the Earth's upper mantle. Previous numerical studies have shown how slab dehydration and mantle hydration can impact the dynamics of a subduction system by allowing a more vigorous mantle flow and promoting localisation of deformation in the lithosphere and mantle. The depths at which dehydration reactions occur in the hydrated portions of the slab are well constrained in these models by thermodynamic calculations. However, computational models use different numerical schemes to simulate the migration of free water. We aim to show {{the influence of the}} numerical scheme of free <b>water</b> <b>migration</b> on the dynamics of the upper mantle and more specifically the mantle wedge. We investigate the following three simple migration schemes with a finite-element model: (1) element-wise vertical migration of free water, occurring independent of the flow of the solid phase; (2) an imposed vertical free water velocity; and (3) a Darcy velocity, where the free water velocity {{is a function of the}} pressure gradient caused by the difference in density between water and the surrounding rocks. In addition, the flow of the solid material field also moves the free water in the imposed vertical velocity and Darcy schemes. We first test the influence of the <b>water</b> <b>migration</b> scheme using a simple model that simulates the sinking of a cold, hydrated cylinder into a dry, warm mantle. We find that the free <b>water</b> <b>migration</b> scheme has only a limited impact on the water distribution after 1 Myr in these models. We next investigate slab dehydration and mantle hydration with a thermomechanical subduction model that includes brittle behaviour and viscous water-dependent creep flow laws. Our models demonstrate that the bound water distribution is not greatly influenced by the <b>water</b> <b>migration</b> scheme whereas the free water distribution is. We find that a bound water-dependent creep flow law results in a broader area of hydration in the mantle wedge, which feeds back to the dynamics of the system by the associated weakening. This finding underlines the importance of using dynamic time evolution models to investigate the effects of (de) hydration. We also show that hydrated material can be transported down to the base of the upper mantle at 670 km. Although (de) hydration processes influence subduction dynamics, we find that the exact numerical implementation of free <b>water</b> <b>migration</b> is not important in the basic schemes we investigated. A simple implementation of <b>water</b> <b>migration</b> could be sufficient for a first-order impression of the effects of water for studies that focus on large-scale features of subduction dynamics...|$|E

Bread was baked both as pan-baked and freestanding loaves. The anti-staling agents maltogenic alpha-amylase, distilled monoglyceride and lipase had a direct influence on starch retrogradation, whereas gluten and waxy wheat flour diluted the amylopectin content or changed the ratio between amylose and amylopectin. The degree of staling was measured as the firmness and springiness, together with two new methods, crumbliness and cutability. In addition, the degrees of amylopectin retrogradation and amylose-lipid complex formation were analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry, and the water content, water loss and <b>water</b> <b>migration</b> were measured. The addition of alpha-amylase improved most staling parameters, although the changes were not as large as expected. Furthermore, monoglyceride and lipase increased the formation of amylose-lipid complexes, but only lipase gave better results regarding the specific volume and firmness. Increased amylose-lipid complex formation was seen to increase <b>water</b> <b>migration</b> from crumb to crust.
