25|$|On 2 May 2008, US President George W. Bush said he {{was asking}} Congress to approve an extra $770million funding for {{international}} food aid. On 16 October 2008, in a speech at a United Nations gathering on World Food Day, former US president Bill Clinton criticized the bipartisan coalition in Congress that blocked efforts to make some aid donations in cash rather than in food. Referring in part to policies that had pressured African governments to reduce subsidies for fertilizer and other agricultural inputs, Clinton also said:We need the World Bank, the IMF, all the big foundations, and all the governments to admit that, for 30 years, we all blew it, including me when I was President. We were wrong to believe that food was like some other product in international trade, and <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{go back to a}} more responsible and sustainable form of agriculture.The release of Japan's rice reserves onto the market may bring the rice price down significantly. As of 16 May, anticipation of the move had already lowered prices by 14% in a single week.|$|E

We have to meet the enemy in our streets as they deserve.|$|E
500|$|This {{episode was}} written by Glen Morgan and James Wong and {{directed}} by David Nutter. Originally, the season two premiere {{was supposed to be}} written by series creator Chris Carter. In the rough draft of this version, Mulder would have been sent to Moscow. Carter, instead, assigned Morgan and Wong the task of writing the season opener. Before working on The X-Files, Morgan had written a script with the same name about a man who goes to a telescope located in Chile. The script was never made, but Morgan liked various elements of it, so he cannibalized parts for [...] "Little Green Men". In addition, the episode was specifically written for Mulder to question himself and his beliefs. According to the two writers, one of the main themes of the episode is “the idea that <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> fight our own little green men and carry on.” ...|$|E

The Struts co-wrote, produced and programmed the track, and additionally played the keys. Filip Runesson played the strings, with Lars Norgren mixing the song and Björn Engelmann mastering it.

As the season progresses, Lauren and Puck's relationship continues to grow stronger. Their relationship begins to form in the ninth episode of the second season titled [...] "Special Education". After Puck attempts to recruit new members for the William McKinley High School glee club, members of the football team lock him in a port-a-potty. After being discovered by Lauren, he convinces her to join New Directions, despite her belief that show choir is stupid. Ashley Fink said of their relationship: [...] "I think Ryan Murphy has a master plan and we're all kind of along for the ride.

[...] Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post, stated that [...] "Keamy is Crazy! … out of all the bad guys on the Island—past, present, and future—Keamy has to be one of the most dangerous ones.

500|$|In January Sylvia {{was summoned}} to Paris, where Emmeline and Christabel were waiting. Their mother had just {{returned}} from another tour of the US, and Sylvia had just been released from prison. All three women were exhausted and stressed, which added considerably to the tension. In her 1931 book The Suffrage Movement Sylvia describes Christabel as an unreasonable figure, haranguing her for refusing to toe the WSPU line:She turned to me. [...] "You have your own ideas. We do not want that; we want all our women to take their instructions and walk in step like an army!" [...] Too tired, too ill to argue, I made no reply. I was oppressed by a sense of tragedy, grieved by her ruthlessness. Her glorification of autocracy seemed to me remote indeed from the struggle we were waging, the grim fight even now proceeding in the cells. I thought of many others who had been thrust aside for some minor difference.With their mother's blessing, Christabel ordered Sylvia's group to dissociate from the WSPU. Pankhurst tried to persuade the ELFS to remove the word [...] "suffragettes" [...] from its name, since it was inextricably linked to the WSPU. When Sylvia refused, her mother switched to fierce anger in a letter:You are unreasonable, always have been & I fear always will be. I suppose you were made so!... Had you chosen a name which we could approve we could have done much to launch you & advertise your society by name. Now you must take your own way of doing so. I am sorry but you make your own difficulties by an incapacity to look at situations from other people's point of view as well as your own. Perhaps in time you will learn the lessons that <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> learn in life.Adela, unemployed and unsure of her future, had become a worry for Pankhurst as well.

2500|$|Kaine and Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona {{introduced}} the War Powers Consultation Act of 2014, which {{would replace the}} War Powers Act of 1973, bringing the Congress back into decisions on the deployment of U.S. military forces. The bill would establish a Congressional Consultation Committee, with which the President {{would be required to}} consult regularly regarding significant foreign policy matters; before ordering the deployment of the Armed Forces into a significant armed conflict; and at least every two months for the duration of any significant armed conflict. Kaine argued for the bill by citing his [...] "frustration" [...] over the sloppiness of [...] "process and communication over decisions of war", noting that [...] "Presidents tend to overreach and Congress sometimes willingly ducks tough votes and decisions. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do better." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nagoya University Graduate School of Law {{academic}} Frank Bennett had {{wished to}} include {{support for the}} Bluebook—a widely used system of legal citations, into the open source citation management software Zotero. However, lawyers representing the Harvard Law Review Association, who publishes the Bluebook, asserted that the Bluebooks inclusion of [...] "carefully curated examples, explanations and other textual materials" [...] made it a copyrighted work. Carl Malamud, head of the organization Public.Resource.Org, was informed by Bennett about the refusals. New York University School of Law professor Christopher Jon Sprigman caught wind of Malamud's correspondence; he had argued that the system of citation expressed in the Bluebook was {{in the public domain}} because its widely mandated use in the court system made it an edict of government, going on to state that [...] "in this case, a copyright is being used to keep something private that <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> use."

2500|$|With Lawry's {{defensive}} leadership {{under heavy}} fire he was dropped {{along with three}} other players, becoming the first Australian captain to be dropped {{in the middle of}} a series. He was not informed privately by the Board and only found out after his axing was made public. The Australian selectors Don Bradman, Sam Loxton and Neil Harvey delayed the announcement while they tried to locate Lawry at the end of the Sixth Test, but he had already left for his home in Melbourne and they were unable to find him. He first heard the news on the radio and the selectors were much maligned in the press as a result. Lawry never played for Australia again despite being only 33 and averaging 47.15, but began his 40-year career as a commentator in the Seventh Test, saying [...] "Well, I suppose <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> get around to it some day". Two days earlier, after lengthy discussion, the ACB had voted 7–6 to acknowledge and respond to Lawry's letter following the South African tour, although their reply did not address Lawry's concerns. His successor Chappell condemned the Board's actions as [...] "unbelievable". Immediately after his appointment, the new leader told his wife [...] "The bastards won't get me the way they got Bill", and he later went out on his own terms. Victorian and Australian teammate Paul Sheahan said [...] "The fact that no-one had the courage to tell him he was to lose his job as Australian captain was disgraceful." [...] At the same time, Sheahan said that Lawry was [...] "a bit of an autocrat" [...] and [...] "not the sort of captain who stood alongside you and drew the best out of you." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fully {{aware that}} they needed to win the last Test to retain the Ashes the Australian {{selectors}} axed Bill Lawry, the first Australian captain ever to be dropped mid-series. Don Bradman, Sam Loxton and Neil Harvey delayed the announcement while they tried to locate Lawry {{at the end of the}} Sixth Test, but he had already left for his home in Melbourne and they were unable to find him. He first heard the news on the radio and the selectors were much maligned in the press as a result. Lawry never played for Australia again despite being only 33 and averaging 47.15, but began his 40-year career as a commentator in the Seventh Test, saying [...] "Well, I suppose <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> get around to it some day". Although the appointment of the more aggressive Ian Chappell as captain (with Ian Redpath as his vice-captain) made sense, Lawry was still a redoubtable opening batsman who averaged 40.50 in the series and many thought that his services should have been retained. Instead the veteran Victorian opener Ken Eastwood was called up for his only Test after having made 177 against New South Wales. John Gleeson, Ashley Mallett and Ross Duncan were all dropped and replaced by debutant Tony Dell, a left-arm fast medium bowler, and the leg-spinners Kerry O'Keeffe and Terry Jenner. The selectors made another mistake in not recalling Garth McKenzie to partner his Western Australia team-mate Dennis Lillee after he had broken Geoff Boycott's arm on the same ground in a one-day match. McKenzie could have been a real handful for the England batsmen, and was only two wickets short of Richie Benaud's Australian Test record of 248 wickets (Benaud wrote 'Bring back McKenzie' in his newspaper column). This meant Australia's four man bowling attack had only 6 Test wickets to their name, the least since [...] in 1945–46 when seven players made their debut after the war. Boycott was, of course, unfit to play and Brian Luckhurst returned to open the innings, having missed the Sixth Test because of his bruised hands. John Snow had been suffering from an inflamed sacroiliac joint, which required traction and complete rest, but he was declared fit in time for the Test. This was Australian umpire Lou Rowan's last Test as he retired at the end of the season and the Australian selectors Don Bradman retired after 35 years, out of which Australian had held the Ashes for all but 6 years.|$|E
