25|$|Following a short {{service by}} the Dean, the Prince of Wales, who himself {{had served in}} the war, declared:I unveil this tablet in honour of our comrades, from every land under the Crown, who fell in the Great War. Time cannot dim our remembrance of them, nor lessen our {{gratitude}} to our Allies, <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> us the land in which many of them lie buried, so that we can care for their graves for ever. This was followed by the laying of a wreath, the dedication by the Dean, the hymn O Valiant Hearts (a war poem set to music to remember the fallen of the Great War), prayers, the first verse of the National Anthem, and the closing blessing. After the Prince and the Prime Ministers had left, the Abbey was opened to allow those waiting outside to join the rest of the congregation in viewing the memorial.|$|E
25|$|In its own April 15, 2010, {{rebuttal}} to the Kairos Palestine document, the Central Conference of American Rabbis (CCAR) criticized it for arguing “that leading Israel into {{isolation is}} the only way there can be a peaceful solution in the Holy Land.” While the document professed to condemn both sides of the Israel-Palestinian struggle, it contained “pronouncements which vindicate one side while demonizing the other,” applying one “moral yardstick” to Israel and another to Palestinians, and calling for action only against Israel. Noting that the document “consistently objects to ‘the Occupation,’ without making clear that it is referring exclusively to lands occupied by Israel and in dispute since the Six-Day War of 1967,” the rabbis said that the document implicitly rejects “the very notion of a Jewish State.” The rabbis were additionally concerned that the document, while professing to reject violence, expressed “respect” and “high esteem for those <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> their life for our nation,” which they interpreted as praise of suicide bombers.|$|E

It commemorates all of those <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> their lives in war. The ceremony held in 2004 illustrates the tradition of Remembrance Sunday in Gibraltar. On 14 November 2004, the ceremony at the Cross of Sacrifice was led by the Governor of Gibraltar, who read the Bidding. Members of the Royal Gibraltar Regiment fired a salute from Princess Caroline's Battery. This {{was followed by a}} two-minute period of silence, and a second gun salute. A parade was also scheduled for the day, with participation of the British Forces Gibraltar and members of the Gibraltar and Estepona branches of the Royal British Legion. The Last Post was played, and remembrance poppy wreaths were laid {{at the base of the}} monument by Governor Sir Francis Richards, the Chief Minister of Gibraltar Peter Caruana, and members of military and civil groups. After a short service, the ceremony ended with Reveille and the National Anthem. Similarly, on 9 November 2008, Remembrance Sunday was observed with the customary ceremony at the Cross of Sacrifice.|$|E

500|$|The story {{contains}} many autobiographical elements, {{and the character}} of Olivero owes much to Read's experiences as {{an officer in the}} British Army during the First World War. The novel was positively received, although some commentators have considered it to be [...] "inscrutable", and one has suggested that it has been so differently and vaguely interpreted by those <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> it serious study that it may lack the form and content to justify the praise it has received.|$|E

Local farmers assisted the emergency services by transporting equipment using quad bikes and four-wheel drive vehicles. Sergeant Jo Fawcett of the Cumbria Constabulary also offered thanks, saying that [...] "There {{are so many people}} <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> up their own time to contribute in some way to dealing with the aftermath of the derailment that it would be unfair to name them for fear of missing someone out." ...|$|E

Harrison commented: [...] "I decided... I'm {{not going to be a}} great sitar player... because I should have started at least fifteen years earlier." [...] Harrison continued to use Indian instrumentation occasionally on his solo albums and remained strongly associated with the genre.

500|$|Unionist backbenchers {{had long}} been restive as Lloyd George granted the Liberals in the Coalition more than their {{proportionate}} share of offices. In October 1922, discontent among Unionists against the Lloyd George Coalition Government erupted. When Unionist MPs were summoned to the Carlton Club for a meeting to receive their instructions for the forthcoming election, which, as in 1918 was to be fought in coalition with the Lloyd George Liberals, they instead rebelled and voted to fight the election as a single party. Lloyd George resigned as Prime Minister. Most Unionist leaders, including Austen Chamberlain, had supported the Coalition and advocated its continuation. They resigned from their government and party offices, with Austen Chamberlain writing, [...] "The meeting today rejected our advice. Other men <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> other counsels must inherit our burden". Bonar Law was recalled from retirement to lead the Unionists as Prime Minister. Neville Chamberlain was in Canada {{at the time of}} the meeting and so was not forced to choose between supporting his brother's leadership and bringing down a man he despised.|$|E
500|$|Former WWE wrestler Cody Rhodes {{has stated}} that Michaels's win, {{in which he was}} the first wrestler to enter the ring in the #1 {{position}} and win the match, is his favorite ending to a Royal Rumble match. Reviewing the event for Online Onslaught, columnist Adam Gutschmidt evaluated the event as acceptable but not exceptional. He found the Royal Rumble match to be {{the best part of the}} show, although he claimed that the WWF's switch to having wrestlers enter every 60 seconds hurt the match. He also found the inconclusive ending to the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match frustrating and rated the match between The Undertaker and Irwin R. Schyster as a [...] "dud". The event has also been rated by customers at Amazon.com, <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> the event four and a half out of five stars. Art O'Donnell, writer of the website WrestleCrap, has inducted the Rumble match into the site's list of [...] "the very worst in pro wrestling". He cites that most of the Royal Rumble participants' gimmicks and the lack of main event wrestlers (such as Jeff Jarrett, Scott Hall and The Undertaker) as his reasons for including the event in the list.|$|E
