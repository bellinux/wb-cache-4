40|$|<b>Whistlers</b> {{detected}} at Dunedin, New Zealand are an anomaly: {{there is}} little lightning around Dunedin's conjugate point yet <b>whistlers</b> appear in relatively large numbers. These surplus <b>whistlers</b> have consequently inspired investigations into their origins. Dunedin's lightning-sparse conjugate point lies in the Aleutian Islands, a region populated with active volcanoes. Their presence has allowed us to perform a novel analysis: the correlation of <b>whistlers</b> to volcanic lightning. We report on our investigation, which successfully yielded the first observations of "volcanic <b>whistlers.</b> " It {{was found that the}} single July 2008 Mount Okmok eruption had an impressive effect on the number of <b>whistlers</b> at Dunedin. The eruptions at Mount Redoubt in 2009 also caused a sporadic flow of <b>whistlers</b> in Dunedin...|$|R

5|$|The 2010 Winter Olympic Games and Paralympic Games {{were held}} in Vancouver and <b>Whistler,</b> British Columbia, Canada.

The majority of ice sport events {{were held in}} Vancouver, while <b>Whistler,</b> which normally serves as a ski resort, hosted the snow events. Six non-competition venues, three each in Vancouver and <b>Whistler,</b> provided athlete housing, space for media, and locations for ceremonies associated with the Games.|$|E
5|$|James Abbott McNeill <b>Whistler</b> {{was born}} in the United States in 1834, the son of George Washington <b>Whistler,</b> a railway engineer. In 1843, his father {{relocated}} the family to Saint Petersburg, Russia, where James received training in painting. After a stay in England, he returned to America to attend the US Military Academy at West Point in 1851. In 1855, he made his way back to Europe, determined to dedicate himself to painting. He settled in Paris at first, but in 1859 moved to London, where he would spend most of the remainder of his life. There he met Dante Gabriel Rossetti {{and other members of the}} Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, who would have a profound influence on <b>Whistler.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{properties}} of Nu <b>whistlers</b> {{are discussed in}} the light of observations by the MAGION 5 satellite, and of numerically simulated spectrograms of lightning-induced VLF emissions. The method of simulation is described in full. With the information from this numerical modelling, we distinguish the characteristics of the spectrograms that depend {{on the site of the}} lightning strokes from those that are determined mainly by the position of the satellite. Also, we identify the region in the magnetosphere where Nu <b>whistlers</b> are observed most often, and the geomagnetic conditions favouring their appearance. The relation between magnetospherically reflected (MR) <b>whistlers</b> and Nu <b>whistlers</b> is demonstrated by the gradual transformation of MR <b>whistlers</b> into Nu <b>whistlers</b> as the satellite moves from the high-altitude equatorial region to lower altitudes and higher latitudes. The magnetospheric reflection of nonducted whistler-mode waves, which is of decisive importance in the formation of Nu <b>whistlers,</b> is discussed in detail...|$|R
40|$|The paper investigates two unusual {{types of}} ion {{cyclotron}} <b>whistlers</b> {{that were found}} in the low-latitude topside ionosphere by analyzing ISIS VLF electric-field data received at Kashima, Japan. One type is characterized by an asymptotic frequency equal to one half the local proton gyrofrequency; the asymptotic frequency of the other type corresponds to the minimum proton gyrofrequency along the geomagnetic field line passing through the satellite. The observations are compared with theoretical spectrograms of the ion cyclotron <b>whistlers</b> computed for appropriate model distributions of electrons and ions in the topside ionosphere. It is found that the <b>whistlers</b> with the asymptotic frequency of one half the local proton gyrofrequency are deuteron <b>whistlers</b> and that the other <b>whistlers</b> are due to the transequatorial propagation of proton or deuteron <b>whistlers</b> originating in the southern hemisphere...|$|R

5|$|Symphony in White, No. 3, is a {{painting}} by James Abbott McNeill <b>Whistler.</b> The work shows two women dressed in white, one sitting on a sofa and the other resting on the floor. The model on the sofa is Joanna Heffernan, the artist's mistress. By calling the painting Symphony in White, No. 3, <b>Whistler</b> intended to emphasise his artistic philosophy of corresponding arts, inspired by the poet Charles Baudelaire. The presence of a fan on the floor shows the influence of Japonisme, which was a popular artistic trend in European art at the time. <b>Whistler</b> was also greatly influenced by his colleague and friend Albert Joseph Moore, and their works show considerable similarities.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{properties}} of Nu <b>whistlers</b> {{are discussed in}} the light of observations by the MAGION 5 satellite, and of nu-merically simulated spectrograms of lightning-induced VLF emissions. The method of simulation is described in full. With the information from this numerical modelling, we dis-tinguish the characteristics of the spectrograms that depend {{on the site of the}} lightning strokes from those that are deter-mined mainly by the position of the satellite. Also, we iden-tify the region in the magnetosphere where Nu <b>whistlers</b> are observed most often, and the geomagnetic conditions favour-ing their appearance. The relation between magnetospher-ically reflected (MR) <b>whistlers</b> and Nu <b>whistlers</b> is demon-strated by the gradual transformation of MR <b>whistlers</b> into Nu <b>whistlers</b> as the satellite moves from the high-altitude equatorial region to lower altitudes and higher latitudes.

50|$|<b>Whistler's</b> {{family did}} not approve of Hiffernan. Unmarried artists' models, and {{especially}} those who posed nude, were considered {{at that time to}} be little better than prostitutes. However, Hiffernan seems only to have modeled for friends, so perhaps the objections to her made by <b>Whistler's</b> family were based more on social class than on Hifferman's personal character. When <b>Whistler's</b> mother visited from America in 1864, alternative accommodation had to be found for Hiffernan, who also seems to have been the cause of <b>Whistler's</b> quarrel with Alphonse Legros in 1863.|$|R

30|$|Large {{number of}} high {{dispersion}} <b>whistlers</b> recorded at low latitude station Varanasi (L = 1.07) are analysed {{and it is}} {{find out that they}} have propagated along L≃ 2.12 – 2.76. This is explained by considering the propagation of <b>whistlers</b> through the earth-ionosphere wave guide after exiting from the duct towards the equator. Using diffusive equilibrium model (DE- 1), we have estimated equatorial electron density, total electron content in a flux tube and large scale convective electric fields which are in good agreement with the results reported by other workers from the analysis of mid latitude <b>whistlers.</b> The significance {{of this paper is to}} probe mid latitude plasmasphere using <b>whistlers</b> recorded at low latitudes. Further, an attempt has been made to study the propagation mechanism of low latitude <b>whistlers.</b>|$|R

40|$|The high {{latitude}} {{limit of}} transequatorial deuteron <b>whistlers</b> {{is found to}} occur at latitudes where B(m) = B/ 2, in which B is the local magnetic field at the satellite and B(m) is the minimum magnetic field on the field line through the satellite. The high latitude limit of transequatorial proton <b>whistlers,</b> often extends to the latitude where B(m) = B/ 4 in the autumn and winter. Transequatorial deuteron <b>whistlers</b> have a constant time interval for an echo train. The damping rate of the cyclotron resonant interaction with rare deuteron {{is large enough to}} generate deuteron <b>whistlers.</b> Ray tracing results for nonducted propagation of transequatorial deuteron <b>whistlers</b> show that rays are guided by the geomagnetic field within one degree in invariant latitude for several bounces between the two hemispheres...|$|R

5|$|Site {{construction}} of the facility began on 1 June 2005 following environmental approval from the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. Safety and security was then put in place on the site.

A core group of 60 workers was involved with track construction from June 2005 to December 2007.

5|$|The <b>Whistler</b> Sliding Centre in <b>Whistler,</b> British Columbia was {{the site}} of women's {{skeleton}} at the 2010 Olympic Games in Vancouver, Canada.

It was certified for competition in sliding sports by the International Luge Federation (FIL) and the International Bobsleigh and Tobogganing Federation (FIBT) in March, 2008 in a process called homologation where hundreds of athletes ran the track. This was the first time many competitors at the 2010 Games were able to try the track and begin to develop strategies for it.
