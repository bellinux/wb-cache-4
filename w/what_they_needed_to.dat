Meymaneh {{is located in}} northwestern Afghanistan, which has become {{increasingly}} restless in recent years. Both the military and political heads {{of the armed forces}} agreed about the weakened state of the base. When the Norwegian Army was asked <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> defend their position, they asked for 120 troops and long-range weapons. They also requested a mobile reaction force, so that allies in the region could assist each other if they came under heavy attack.|$|E

500|$|Madonna {{wanted to}} have gospel music {{as part of the}} song, with {{virtually}} no instrumentation, only the sound of an organ and her singing. So she started experimenting using just her vocals, giving away to the bridge being composed. After the full song was finalized, Madonna and Leonard decided to record it alongside a choir around September 1988. Both of them met with musician Andraé Crouch and vocalist Roberto Noriega, and signed their choir to provide background vocals. Crouch scrutinized the lyrics as he wanted to [...] "find out what the intention of the song might be. We're very particular in choosing what we work with, and we liked what we heard." [...] At Jonny Yuma recording studio, he got his choir together and explained to them <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> do during the recording session. He had listened to the demo of [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] in his car, and directed the choir accordingly. The choir was recorded separately, and Leonard wanted it to be added during post-production.|$|E
2500|$|In 2015, a {{study found}} that when dogs and their owners interact, {{extended}} eye contact (mutual gaze) increases oxytocin levels in both the dog and its owner. As oxytocin {{is known for its}} role in maternal bonding, it is considered likely that this effect has supported the coevolution of human-dog bonding. One observer has stated, [...] "The dog could have arisen only from animals predisposed to human society by lack of fear, attentiveness, curiosity, necessity, and recognition of advantage gained through collaboration....the humans and wolves involved in the conversion were sentient, observant beings constantly making decisions about how they lived and what they did, based on the perceived ability to obtain at a given time and place <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> survive and thrive. They were social animals willing, even eager, to join forces with another animal to merge their sense of group with the others' sense and create an expanded super-group that was beneficial to both in multiple ways. They were individual animals and people involved, from our perspective, in a biological and cultural process that involved linking not only their lives but the evolutionary fate of their heirs in ways, we must assume, they could never have imagined. Powerful emotions were in play that many observers today refer to as love – boundless, unquestioning love." ...|$|E

2500|$|Even the Comes of the Saxon Shore did {{not join}} forces with Constantine's {{campaign}} to Gaul. He was probably able to maintain his defensive organization until the early 5th century. This part of Britain had most of the towns and the most highly developed commodity production. It is believed that military activity in the forts there continued well into the early 5th century. The Saxon Shore forts were [...] probably no longer supplied from state magazines however. As on Hadrian's Wall, their garrisons, already largely composed of Germanii, managed small farms {{with their families and}} produced most of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> live, themselves. As the pressure of Anglo-Saxon migration in Britain grew steadily and they slowly acquired land in the fertile lowlands, the Romano-British fled to the forts of the Saxon Shore, which were probably largely still intact. However, this only protected them temporarily from the invaders. One of them, Anderitum, was besieged and stormed by the Anglo-Saxons led by the first king of Sussex, Ælle (477-514), and his son, Cissa, in 491. The defenders were massacred to the last man. This is one of the rare surviving reports from the migration period of the successful siege of a fortified Roman settlement by new immigrants. In the Gallic Chronicles there is further evidence that the island had increasingly come under Anglo-Saxon domination no later than 440/441 - probably resulting from a rebellion of the foederati recruited by the provinces.|$|E

60|$|The village {{street is}} long, and our escort waxed more {{numerous}} at every step, till Miss Shepard actually counted forty {{of these little}} reprobates, and more were doubtless added afterwards. At first, no doubt, they begged in earnest hope of getting some baiocchi; but, by and by, perceiving that we had determined not to give them anything, they made a joke of the matter, and began to laugh and to babble, and turn heels over head, still keeping about us, like a swarm of flies, and now and then begging again with all their might. There were as few pretty faces as I ever saw among {{the same number of}} children; and they were as ragged and dirty little imps as any in the world, and, moreover, tainted the air with a very disagreeable odor from their rags and dirt; rugged and healthy enough, nevertheless, and sufficiently intelligent; certainly bold and persevering too; so {{that it is hard to}} say <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> fit them for success in life. Yet they begin as beggars, and no doubt will end so, as all their parents and grandparents do; for in our walk through the village, every old woman and many younger ones held out their hands for alms, as if they had all been famished. Yet these people kept their houses over their heads; had firesides in winter, I suppose, and food out of their little gardens every day; pigs to kill, chickens, olives, wine, and a great many things to make life comfortable. The children, desperately as they begged, looked in good bodily ease, and happy enough; but, certainly, there was a look of earnest misery in the faces of some of the old women, either genuine or exceedingly well acted.|$|E
