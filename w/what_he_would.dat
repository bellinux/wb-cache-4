5|$|He {{was known}} for his support of {{representative}} democracy and his populist style. For example, he would hold town halls and let constituents vote on motions to decide <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> do in Congress on their behalf and these meetings helped Bedell understand the problems of his constituents; as a result, he backed issues that were important to his farming constituency, such as waterway usage fees and production constraints.|$|E
5|$|Petterson's {{compulsory}} {{delivery of the}} talking points based on faulty U.S. intelligence would {{set the stage for}} strained relations between Washington and Khartoum that lasted well into Carney's early tenure as ambassador. In late 1995, Carney was also asked to deliver a similar non-paper message based on <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> later recount as having been poorly sourced U.S. intelligence.|$|E
5|$|As {{the senator}} {{discussed}} their finances, the telecast again showed Pat Nixon, fixedly watching her husband. Pat Nixon later stated that her rapt gaze {{was because she}} did not know exactly <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> say, and wanted to hear. Nixon detailed their assets and liabilities: the mortgaged home in Washington; the similarly mortgaged home in California, then occupied by his parents. The loans from his parents and from Riggs Bank. The borrowed-against life insurance policy on the senator; no insurance on his wife or children. The two-year-old Oldsmobile and the family furniture, and {{that he and his wife}} owned no stocks or bonds.|$|E

5|$|During the 1993 {{run for the}} {{national}} title, Smith used a method that was introduced to him {{at a conference in}} Switzerland. At the conference, Smith was presented a tape by a lecturer who used doctored images to achieve his goal of losing weight. The photos showed the lecturer <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> look like if he were thinner as motivation to reach his weight-loss goals. Smith took a picture of the scoreboard from the 1982 Championship, modified it to read 1993 and erased the name Georgetown, leaving that space blank. He proceeded to place copies of the doctored photo in all of the players' lockers.|$|E
5|$|In the Time Room, Prismo reveals to Jake that Finn {{has been}} transported to a separate, altered world {{based on his}} wish that The Lich never existed. Together, they watch the events in Finn's world on Prismo's television, and Prismo asks Jake <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> like to wish for. Jake wishes for a sandwich, but Prismo urges him to {{consider}} using his wish on something important, such as helping Finn. Jake tells Prismo he will use it when he knows Finn will be in real danger, and after a conversation, the two decide to hang out; Prismo mutes the TV and the two begin to ignore the events happening in Finn's timeline.|$|E
5|$|McGovern {{endorsed}} Humphrey at the convention, to {{the dismay}} of some anti-war figures who considered it a betrayal. Humphrey went on to lose the general election to Richard Nixon. McGovern returned to his Senate reelection race, facing Republican former Governor Archie M. Gubbrud. While South Dakota voters sympathized with McGovern over his daughter's arrest, he initially suffered a substantial drop in popularity over the events in Chicago. However, McGovern conducted an energetic campaign that focused on his service to the state, while Gubbrud ran a lackluster effort. In November, McGovern won 57percent of the vote in <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> consider the easiest and most decisive victory of his career.|$|E

5000|$|Like most acid-heads, Jimi had {{visions and}} he wanted to create music to express <b>what</b> <b>he</b> saw. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> try to explain this to people, but it didn't make sense because it was not linked to reality in any way. —Kathy Etchingham ...|$|R

5|$|The {{script was}} sent to Prince who agreed to voice the {{character}} and sent back a page of notes about <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be wearing in various scenes. The writers were confused when the notes did not correspond to the script and they discovered that Prince was referring to a script that had been written by someone else. Prince disliked the Simpsons writers' script and demanded the other one be made into an episode, but the writers refused. The episode eventually fell through and never made it past written form. It {{became one of the}} few completed scripts never to be produced.|$|E
5|$|Veronica {{tracks the}} casino robber {{down to a}} {{volunteer}} police officer. She has evidence, and the police comes to arrest him. However, they don’t find the necklace. At the hospital, Keith hesitates when O’Dell asks him <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> do if Veronica were in danger. Veronica gets her necklace back from the perpetrator’s daughter. Because he gave bone marrow, the ex-husband now has a much more favorable divorce settlement. Veronica tracks down the suspect in the photo, Wang Yi, but his roommate tells Veronica that he is Claire’s boyfriend.|$|E
5|$|Marshall {{performed}} a few ceremonial functions {{for the remainder}} of Wilson's term, such as hosting foreign dignitaries. Among these was Albert I, King of the Belgians, the first European monarch to visit the United States. Edward, Prince of Wales, the future monarch of the United Kingdom, spent two days with Marshall and received a personal tour of Washington from him. First Lady Edith Wilson performed most routine duties of government by reviewing all of Wilson's communications and deciding <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be presented with and what she would delegate to others. The resulting lack of leadership allowed the administration's opponents to prevent ratification of the League of Nations treaty. They attacked the treaty's tenth article, which they believed would allow the United States to be bound in an alliance to European countries that could force the country return to war without an act of Congress. Marshall personally supported the treaty's adoption, but recommended several changes, including the requirement that all parties to it acknowledge the Monroe Doctrine and the United States' sphere of influence, and that the tenth article be made non-binding.|$|E

5|$|Thompson {{participated in}} the May 15 GOP debate, where he {{discussed}} his insistence to trim bureaucracy in the federal government, and {{his support for the}} advancements made in stem cell research, lauding the achievements of the his alma mater University of Wisconsin–Madison in the field. He was asked <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> do {{in the event of a}} looming preemptive attack against a hypothetical anti-American nation promoting terrorism. The candidate quoted former Secretary of State Colin Powell reflecting the need to be sure the intelligence was correct, to deploy the right amount of troops and to make sure that an exit strategy was planned. Following the debate, Thompson campaigned in New Hampshire before taking a break for the rest of the month.|$|E

25|$|Viscera began wrestling in {{pajamas and}} making overtly sexual {{gestures}} in the ring. He became smitten with Raw ring announcer Lilian Garcia and tried different tactics to seduce her every week. At Vengeance in June, Garcia finally reciprocated, proposing {{to him in}} the center of the ring, only to be turned down and left crying in the ring when The Godfather arrived with many of his hos to show Viscera <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be leaving behind if he got married.|$|E
25|$|Alexander {{often had}} to divide his forces and command was given {{to a variety of}} senior {{officers}} on different occasions. For example, a few weeks before this mission of Hephaestion's, Craterus had been sent with a large force to subdue the last two remaining Bactrian rebels. It seems that Hephaestion was chosen when the objectives were far from clear-cut, and Alexander needed a commander on whom he could rely to do <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have done himself without needing instructions.|$|E

Judging from <b>what</b> <b>he</b> saw, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have said that the work to be done at Messrs Slow & Bideawhile's was not very heavy.|$|R
25|$|Given that Ratzinger, Dean of the College, {{was elected}} pope, Angelo Sodano as the vice-dean {{performed}} the dean's role and asked Ratzinger if <b>he</b> <b>would</b> accept {{the election and}} <b>what</b> name <b>he</b> <b>would</b> adopt.|$|R
25|$|Stein {{initially}} {{left his}} wife Jean and young daughter Ray in Scotland {{when he moved}} to Llanelli. His family moved down soon afterwards, but his council house in Hamilton was burgled about eight weeks after they moved. Jean wanted to return to Scotland, and Stein accepted her desire in light of his own disillusionment with the problems at the club. When asked <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> do by the Llanelli manager, Stein said he would probably quit football and become a miner again.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} December 1744, Saxe had {{prepared}} {{plans for a}} spring offensive in the Low Countries. He had {{made up his mind}} not only as to <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> do, but <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> compel his enemy to do, correctly calculating the operational and political difficulties that such a diverse opponent would face. This opponent comprised Britain, the Dutch Republic, Austria, and Saxony, who had concluded the defensive Treaty of Warsaw in January 1745 – the Quadruple Alliance – by which all contractants committed themselves to uphold the Pragmatic Sanction and the House of Austria's claim to the imperial crown. To the Low Countries, the British sent the son of King George II, the 24-year-old Duke of Cumberland, as the new captain general of Britain's army, while Maria Theresa sent the experienced Count Königsegg to command Austrian forces. The trio of generals was completed by Prince Waldeck, commander of the Dutch contingent in theatre. They hoped to gain the initiative by the establishment of forward magazines and an early opening of the campaign season. Major supply and ammunition depot magazines were set up for the British by General Ligonier at Ghent, Oudenarde and Tournai, while the Dutch general, Vander – Duyn, placed theirs at Mons, Charleroi and Tournai.|$|E
25|$|Thayer {{was advised}} by Worth {{regarding}} the events at North Barracks. Captain Hitchcock and Lieutenant Thornton were bruised, while several cadets suffered minor injuries, and Fitzgerald suffered a hand injury. Worth told Thayer that between fifty and ninety cadets {{had been involved}} in the mutiny. Later that day, Thayer met with Gouverneur Kemble, an ordnance manufacturer in Cold Spring, New York, to discuss different items, including the events at West Point. Kemble asked Thayer <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> do about the misconduct, to which Thayer replied he did not know.|$|E
