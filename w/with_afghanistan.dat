25|$|At {{the time}} of independence, the {{indigenous}} Pashtun people living on the border <b>with</b> <b>Afghanistan</b> were given only the choice of becoming a part either of India or Pakistan. Further, by {{the time of}} the Indian independence movement, prominent Pashtun nationalists such as Abdul Ghaffar Khan and his Khudai Khidmatgar movement advocated a united India, and not a united Afghanistan â€“ highlighting the extent to which infrastructure and instability together began to erode Pashtun self-identification <b>with</b> <b>Afghanistan.</b> By the time of independence, popular opinion amongst Pashtuns was split amongst the majority who wished to join the newly formed state of Pakistan, and the minority who wished to become a part of the Dominion of India. When the idea of a united India failed, Ghaffar Khan pledged allegiance to Pakistan and started campaigning for the autonomy of Pakistan's Pashtuns.|$|E

25|$|Quetta, {{which is}} {{the capital of the}} Pakistani {{province}} of Balochistan, has seen numerous of these violent incidents. This is in part because of a separatist movement involving militants from the ethnic minority who desire greater autonomy and also because the Pakistani military is engaged in counter-insurgency operations near to the province's border <b>with</b> <b>Afghanistan,</b> where there is tribal strife that involves the Taliban and allied groups.|$|E
