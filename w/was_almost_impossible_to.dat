5|$|Bismarck {{left the}} Kiel Fjord {{on the morning}} of 28 September 1940 heading east. After an uneventful voyage through rough seas, Bismarck reached Gotenhafen (now Gdynia) the next day. Here Bismarck {{conducted}} a number of sea trials in the relative safety of the Bay of Danzig (now Gdańsk Bay). By 30 November 1940, Lindemann had set a number of tests for the crew, which they passed easily. During high speed trials, Bismarck reached a top speed of , exceeding the design speed. However, one weakness quickly became apparent: without using the rudders but only the screws, Bismarck <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> steer.|$|E
5|$|After {{participating}} in the planned rebellion, Edmund became less popular at court. He was still allowed to accompany the king's wife Philippa to her coronation in January 1330, but his appearances at court became less frequent. At this point he became involved in another plot against the court, when he was convinced by rumours that his brother was still alive. It later emerged that Roger Mortimer himself was responsible for leading Edmund into this belief, in a form of entrapment. The plot was revealed, and in the parliament of March 1330 Edmund was indicted and condemned to death as a traitor. Upon hearing that the verdict was death, the condemned earl pleaded with Edward III for his life, offering to walk from Winchester to London with a rope around his neck {{as a sign of}} atonement. Edward III however knew that leniency was not an option for the aforementioned entrapment utilized by Mortimer could extend to him and potentially be subversive to his own kingship if his father, Edward II truly was alive. Thus Edward III sanctioned the killing of his uncle. It <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> find anyone willing to perform the execution of a man of royal blood, until a convicted murderer eventually beheaded Edmund in exchange for a pardon. Edmund's body was initially buried in a Franciscan church in Winchester, but it was removed to Westminster Abbey in 1331.|$|E

However, “getting rich quick” was a dream that <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> achieve. The immigrants were paid a very low salary and worked long hours of exhausting work. Also, everything that the immigrants consumed had to be purchased from the landowner (see truck system). Soon, their debts became very high.|$|E
25|$|Finding coal {{for heat}} in winter was another preoccupation. The Germans had {{transferred}} the {{authority over the}} coal mines of northern France from Paris to their military headquarters in Brussels. The priority for the coal that did arrive in Paris was for the use in factories. Even with ration cards, adequate coal for heating <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> find. Supplies for normal heating needs were not restored until 1949.|$|E

25|$|The 1950s brought {{important}} changes. Zalaegerszeg got a more industrial profile {{with the}} construction of the textile factory and the discovery of oil resources in 1952. The railway line was expanded, too. Lots of workers were commuting from the nearby villages, because it <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> find a flat in the city, so several residents of Zalaegerszeg (mostly those who were considered to be opposed to the Socialist system) were forced to relocate.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the Inquisition's history, it was rivaled {{by local}} ecclesiastical and secular jurisdictions. No matter how determined, no pope succeeded in {{establishing}} complete {{control over the}} prosecution of heresy. Medieval kings, princes, bishops, and civil authorities all {{had a role in}} prosecuting heresy, except where they individually opposed the practice. The practice reached its apex {{in the second half of}} the 13th century. During this period, the tribunals were almost entirely free from any authority, including that of the pope. Therefore, it <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> eradicate abuse.|$|E
25|$|The control strips (Kontrollstreifen) were {{lines of}} bare earth running {{parallel}} to the border fences. They were not an obstacle as such but provided a simple and effective way for the border guards to monitor unauthorised travel across the border. It <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> cross the strip without leaving footprints, enabling the border guards to identify otherwise undetected escape attempts. They could learn how many individuals had crossed, where escape attempts were being made, and at which times of day escapees were active. From this information, the border guards were able to determine where and when patrols needed to be increased, where improved surveillance from watchtowers and bunkers was required, and which areas needed additional fortifications.|$|E

25|$|In total, 67 Jews and 9 Arabs were killed. Of the Jews killed, 59 {{died during}} the rioting and 8 more later succumbed to their wounds. They {{included}} a dozen women and three {{children under the age}} of five. Twenty-four of the victims were students from the Hebron yeshiva, seven of whom were American or Canadian. The bodies of 57 Jewish victims were buried in mass graves by Arabs, without regard to Jewish burial ritual. Most of the murdered Jews were of Ashkenazi descent, while 12 were Sephardi. 58 are thought to have been injured, including many women and children. One estimate put the figure at 49 seriously and 17 slightly wounded. A letter from the Jews of Hebron to the High Commissioner described cases of torture, mutilation and rape. Eighteen days after the massacre, the Jewish leadership requested that bodies be exhumed to ascertain whether deliberate mutilation had taken place. But after 20 bodies had been disinterred and reburied, it was decided to discontinue. The bodies had been exposed for two days before burial and it <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> ascertain whether or not they had been subject to mutilations after or during the massacre. No conclusions could therefore be made.|$|E
25|$|It <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> walk in {{the narrow}} streets of Paris, due to the mud and traffic, and the Champs-Élysées did not yet exist, so upper and middle class Parisians took their promenades on the grand boulevards, in {{the public and private}} parks and gardens, and above all in the Palais-Royal. The arcades of the Palais-Royal, as {{described}} by the German traveler Berkheim in 1807, contained boutiques with glass show windows displaying jewelry, fabrics, hats, perfumes, boots, dresses, paintings, porcelain, watches, toys, lingerie, and every type of luxury goods. In addition there were offices of doctors, dentists and opticians, bookstores, offices for changing money, and salons for dancing, playing billiards and cards. There were fifteen restaurants and twenty-nine cafes, plus stalls which offered fresh waffles from the oven, sweets, cider and beer. The galleries also offered gambling salons and expensive houses of prostitution. The gallery was busy from the early morning, when people came to read the newspapers and do business, and became especially crowded between five and eight in the evening. At eleven, when the shops closed and the theaters finished, a new crowd arrived, along with several hundred prostitutes, seeking clients. The gates were closed at midnight.|$|E
25|$|ELINT {{operations}} {{aimed at}} China: After China tested its first nuclear weapons on 16 October 1964, at Lop Nur, Xinjiang, India and the USA {{shared a common}} fear about the nuclear capabilities of China. Owing to the extreme remoteness of Chinese testing grounds, strict secrecy surrounding the Chinese nuclear programme, and the extreme difficulty that an Indian or American would have passing themselves off as Chinese, it <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> carry out any HUMINT operation. So, the CIA in the late 1960s decided to launch an ELINT operation along with RAW and ARC to track China's nuclear tests and monitor its missile launches. The operation, in the garb of a mountaineering expedition to Nanda Devi involved celebrated Indian climber M S Kohli who along with operatives of Special Frontier Force and the CIA – most notably Jim Rhyne, a veteran STOL pilot – was to place a permanent ELINT device, a transceiver powered by a plutonium battery, that could detect and report data on future nuclear tests carried out by China. The monitoring device was near successfully implanted on Nanda Devi, when an avalanche forced a hasty withdrawal. Later, a subsequent mountain operation to retrieve or replant the device was aborted when {{it was found that}} the device was lost. Recent reports indicate that radiation traces from this device have been discovered in sediment below the mountain. However, the actual data is not conclusive.|$|E

25|$|Madison {{hoped that}} the war would be over in a couple months after the capture of Canada, but his hopes were quickly dashed. Madison had {{believed}} the state militias would rally to the flag and invade Canada, but the governors in the Northeast failed to cooperate. Their militias either sat out the war or refused to leave their respective states for action. The senior command at the War Department and in the field proved incompetent or cowardly—the general at Detroit surrendered to a smaller British force without firing a shot. Gallatin discovered the war <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> fund, since the national bank had been closed and major financiers in the Northeast refused to help. The American campaign in Canada, led by Henry Dearborn, ended with defeat in the Battle of Stoney Creek. The British armed American Indians in the Northwest, most notably several tribes allied with the Shawnee chief, Tecumseh. But, after losing control of Lake Erie at the naval Battle of Lake Erie in 1813, the British were forced to retreat. General William Henry Harrison caught up with them at the Battle of the Thames, where he destroyed the British and Indian armies, killed Tecumseh, and permanently destroyed Indian power in the Great Lakes region. Madison remains the only president to lead troops in battle while in office, although that battle (the Battle of Bladensburg in 1814) did not go well for the American side. The British then raided Washington, as Madison headed a dispirited militia. Dolley Madison rescued White House valuables and documents shortly before the British burned the White House, the Capitol and other public buildings.|$|E

Under these new laws, it <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> hold public meetings and speech was severely curtailed at those that were held.
