5|$|Although the art {{produced}} (particularly pottery, grave stelai and figurines) {{was used}} by a <b>wider</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> people than much Athenian literature was—including women and children—it is not known how accurately the iconography of classical art mapped the reality of classical society.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological and iconographical {{evidence}} {{provide a}} <b>wider</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> perspectives than literature.

5|$|Although much of Hornung's {{work has}} fallen into obscurity, his Raffles stories {{continued}} to be popular, and have formed numerous film and television adaptations. Hornung's stories dealt with a <b>wider</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> themes than crime: he examined scientific and medical developments, guilt, class and the unequal role played by women in society. Two threads that run through a sizeable proportion of his books are Australia and cricket; the latter was also a lifelong passion.|$|E

5|$|Experiments into behavior, to {{understand}} how organisms detect and {{interact with each other}} and their environment, in which fruit flies, worms, mice, and rats are all widely used. Studies of brain function, such as memory and social behavior, often use rats and birds.

5|$|However, poison {{still exists}} as a murderous entity today, {{but it is}} not as popular form of {{conducting}} murder {{as it used to be}} in past times, probably because of the <b>wider</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> ways to kill people and other factors that must be taken into consideration. One of the more recent deaths by poisoning was that of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko in 2006 from lethal polonium-210 radiation poisoning.|$|E

He felt the Chase Promenade might have served as a better forum and would have left the artist unfettered to choose from a <b>wider</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> pieces.|$|E
5|$|Riesling {{is almost}} never {{fermented}} or aged in new oak (although large old oak barrels {{are often used}} to store and stabilize Riesling based wines in Germany and Alsace). This means that Riesling tends to be lighter weight and therefore suitable to a <b>wider</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> foods. The sharp acidity/sweetness in Rieslings {{can serve as a}} good balance to foods that have a high salt content. In Germany, cabbage is sometimes cooked with riesling to reduce the vegetable's smell.|$|E

Since choanoflagellates are thought to be animals' closest single-celled relatives, a team of scientists examined the biochemistry and genes of one choanoflagellate species. They concluded that this species could not produce 24-isopropylcholesterol but that investigation of a <b>wider</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> choanoflagellates would be necessary in order to prove that the fossil 24-isopropylcholestane could only have been produced by demosponges.|$|E
