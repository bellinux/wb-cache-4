40|$|Growth in the {{telecommunication}} industry {{continues to}} expand with requirements evolving around increased bandwidth and security. Advances in networking technologies have introduced low cost optical components that has made passive optical networks (PON) the choice for providing huge bandwidth to end users. PON are covered by established standards such as IEEE 802. 3 ah and ITU-T G. 983. 1 / 984. 1, with star topology of broadcast and select (B 2 ̆ 6 S) on shared fiber links that poses security vulnerability in terms of confidentiality and privacy;Research and reports in the literature focus around increasing cardinality via coding schemes that lack in addressing security, which was left for implementation in application layers via cryptography. This dissertation presents an approach on security in PON at the network level using slow wavelength hopping techniques and diffusion of data packets among dense <b>wave</b> <b>division</b> <b>multiplex</b> (DWDM). Orthogonal wavelength sequences are generated by mapping an ITU-T G 694. 1 based wavelength grid matrix and code matrices. The arrangement of wavelengths in the wavelength grid matrix, which can be changed frequently (i. e, hourly) serves as the first key of secure operation. Allocation of generated wavelength sequences distributed in multiple quantities to nodes based on their security level serve as second individual keys for the nodes. In addition, an improved level of security provided via the cycling order of those allocated wavelength sequences to nodes is the third key between the central office (CO) and a node. The proposed approach to PON security provides three new keys available outside the world of cryptography;Various coding techniques are used, and results show that even time spreading/wavelength hopping based on symmetric prime numbers provided the least wavelength sequences; however, it provided excellent correlation properties and level of security. A PON simulation model was implemented to investigate channel impairments in DWDM with 64 channels spaced at 25 GHz carried over a 25 km ITU-T G. 655 compliant shared fiber cable.

40|$|FWM is a {{non-linear}} {{process where}} {{two or more}} wave propagating throughout a fibre result in a production of frequencies different {{to that of the}} input <b>waves.</b> Space <b>division</b> <b>multiplexing</b> and in particular mode <b>division</b> <b>multiplexing</b> (MDM) have shown promises in overcoming the capacity limit of single-mode fibres for optical telecommunications. Over long distances MDM systems would result in processes like inter modal FWM (IM-FWM). If such systems are to be used commercially, they will require methods of switching data signals between wavelengths and spatial modes. An attractive solution is provided by four-wave mixing (FWM) where two strong pump fields convert the signal into an idler field at another wavelength. However, applications of intermodal FWM (IM-FWM) for telecommunications in multimode fibres are relatively new. Recently, two potentially interesting IM-FWM processes have been identified: phase conjugation (PC) and Bragg scattering (BS) [Essiambre et al., IEEE Photon. Technol. Lett. 25, 539 (2013) ]. Here we investigate conversion efficiencies and spectral bandwidths of PC and BS in a two-mode optical fibre as potential mode/wavelength conversion systems using two numerical models and compare with experimental results. The first model uses the coupled amplitude equations for FWM [Agrawal, Nonlinear fiber optics, Academic Press (2013) ] which take into account self and cross phase modulation and FWM between the four wavelength channels involved. This model was found to agree with experimental results of the PC idler. However discrepancies are found for BS, which we attribute to simultaneous and/or cascaded FWM processes within the same fibre. Thus we use a second, more sophisticated model, the multimode nonlinear Schrödinger equation [Poletti & Horak, JOSAB 25, 1645 (2008) ] which, contrary to the first model, includes all third order nonlinear processes simultaneously and is additionally able to predict cascaded FWM processes that occur throughout the spectrum. We compare {{the differences between the two}} models, analyse the contributions to the BS and PC idlers from multiple FWM processes within the spectrum, and finally present comparisons to experimental results...|$|R
40|$|PhDAll-optical <b>Wave</b> <b>Division</b> <b>Multiplexed</b> (WDM) {{networking}} is {{a promising}} technology for long-haul backbone and large metropolitan optical networks {{in order to}} meet the non-diminishing bandwidth demands of future applications and services. Examples could include archival and recovery of data to/from Storage Area Networks (i. e. for banks), High bandwidth medical imaging (for remote operations), High Definition (HD) digital broadcast and streaming over the Internet, distributed orchestrated computing, and peak-demand short-term connectivity for Access Network providers and wireless network operators for backhaul surges. One desirable feature is fast and automatic provisioning. Connection (lightpath) provisioning in optically switched networks requires both route computation and a single wavelength to be assigned for the lightpath. This is called Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA). RWA can be classified as static RWA and dynamic RWA. Static RWA is an NP-hard (non-polynomial time hard) optimisation task. Dynamic RWA is even more challenging as connection requests arrive dynamically, on-the-fly and have random connection holding times. Traditionally, global-optimum mathematical search schemes like integer linear programming and graph colouring are used to find an optimal solution for NP-hard problems. However such schemes become unusable for connection provisioning in a dynamic environment, due to the computational complexity and time required to undertake the search. To perform dynamic provisioning, different heuristic and stochastic techniques are used. Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) is a population-based global optimisation scheme that belongs to the class of evolutionary search algorithms and has successfully been used to solve many NP-hard optimisation problems in both static and dynamic environments. In this thesis, a novel PSO based scheme is proposed to solve the static RWA case, which can achieve optimal/near-optimal solution. In order to reduce the risk of premature convergence of the swarm and to avoid selecting local optima, a search scheme is proposed to solve the static RWA, based on the position of swarmâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 s global best particle and personal best position of each particle. To solve dynamic RWA problem, a PSO based scheme is proposed which can provision a connection within a fraction of a second. This feature is crucial to provisioning services like bandwidth on demand connectivity. To improve the convergence speed of the swarm towards an optimal/near-optimal solution, a novel chaotic factor is introduced into the PSO algorithm, i. e. CPSO, which helps the swarm reach a relatively good solution in fewer iterations. Experimental results for PSO/CPSO based dynamic RWA algorithms show that the proposed schemes perform better compared to other evolutionary techniques like genetic algorithms, ant colony optimization. This is both in terms of quality of solution and computation time. The proposed schemes also show significant improvements in blocking probability performance compared to traditional dynamic RWA schemes like SP-FF and SP-MU algorithms...|$|R

The overlay for RFoG is based on <b>Wave</b> <b>Division</b> <b>Multiplexing</b> (WDM) -- the passive combination of wavelengths on a single strand of glass.

RFoG offers backwards compatibility with existing RF modulation technology, but offers no additional bandwidth for RF based services. Although not yet completed, the RFoG standard is actually a collection of standardized options which are not compatible with each other (they cannot be mixed on the same PON). Some of the standards may interoperate with other PONs, others may not. It offers a means to support RF technologies in locations where only fiber is available or where copper is not permitted or feasible.

This technology increases the overall bandwidth and total number of users in a wireless system.

In this thesis, radio signal has been generated in optical domain by beating two closely spaced wavelengths. Two lasers are used in this scheme and the output is Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK) signal. Optical switches {{have been used to}} implement the frequency hopping and the operating frequency of the scheme can be changed by controlling the optical switch.

Performance analysis of the system is done in the presence of different transmission impairment and optimization is done to achieve the best performance of the system. A signal with data rate of 4 Gbps has been successfully transmitted up to distance of 125 km. Wavelength used for beating and generation of the down link signal is reused at Remote Antenna Unit (RAU). Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifier (EDFA) has been used to amplify the light signal; different algorithms have been developed and simulated to find the exact value of EDFA gain and number of amplifiers to be used. These algorithms can provide the exact placement of EDFAs in the DWDM ring. It has been verified that if gain is properly adjusted and EDFAs are properly placed, the Continuous Wave (CW) can be reused and uplink signal can be transmitted to Central Station (CS) using this wavelength. After simulation of the algorithm, DWDM ring is simulated to verify the algorithms and bit error rate and eye diagram analysis is done to compare the performance of the system. Ultra-wide band (UWB) signals have been generated using optical biasing, optical delay line and optical subtractor. UWB impulses are generated and their bandwidth has been optimized by controlling the relative delay. DWDM UWB rings are simulated and single UWB generator with capability to generate monocycle; doublet and triplet are presented. The effects of nonlinearities on UWB pulses are also studied.
