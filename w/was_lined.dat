5|$|The walled garden, coach house, and {{dovecote}} {{were retained}} at the public's request {{when the house}} was demolished. On 6September 1974, the garden walls and remaining buildings were awarded Grade II listed status. The herb garden was planted across the four centre beds in 1977 to celebrate the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II. These included Artemisia, catmint, Santolina and curry plants. To keep the plants within the beds, each <b>was</b> <b>lined</b> by box in 1983.|$|E
5|$|Bruce {{was among}} five former Premier League players signed by Birmingham manager Trevor Francis to add {{experience}} to a squad expected to challenge for promotion. He was made {{captain of the}} team, but his Birmingham career was dogged {{by a series of}} disagreements with Francis. Director David Sullivan felt the need to publicly deny rumours that Bruce <b>was</b> <b>lined</b> up to replace Francis as manager after the club's stock market flotation. While playing for Birmingham, Bruce was the subject of several bids from his old Manchester United colleague Bryan Robson to sign for Middlesbrough, but the transfer never happened.|$|E
5|$|The {{band of the}} Great Eastern Railway, {{augmented}} by drummers from the Royal Marines, played the Dead March. Eternal Father, Strong to Save and Abide with Me were sung, and a blessing given by the Bishop of London. The route of the coffin to Liverpool Street station <b>was</b> <b>lined</b> with people. Fryatt was buried at All Saints' Church, Upper Dovercourt. His coffin was carried from the station to the church on a gun carriage. His widow was presented with the insignia of the Belgian Order of Leopold that had been posthumously awarded to Fryatt. Fryatt was also posthumously awarded the Belgian Maritime War Cross.|$|E

5|$|The coffins of General Sikorski and his Chief-of-Staff, General Kilimecki, were {{draped in}} the Polish National Flag and lay in {{state in the}} Cathedral of St. Mary the Crowned. After a Requiem Mass, the bodies were carried in {{procession}} to the H.M. Dockyard with full Military Honours to be shipped to London in anticipation that General Sikorski's remains {{would one day be}} returned to a liberated Poland. The route to the dockyard <b>was</b> <b>lined</b> by British troops and the coffins carried and escorted by Polish Servicemen.|$|E
5|$|D'Erlon's men {{ascended the}} slope and {{advanced}} on the sunken road, Chemin d'Ohain, that ran from behind La Haye Sainte and continued east. It <b>was</b> <b>lined</b> {{on both sides}} by thick hedges, with Bylandt's brigade just across the road while the British brigades had been lying down some 100 yards back from the road, Pack's to Bylandt's left and Kempt's to Bylandt's right. Kempt's 1,900 men were engaged by Bourgeois' brigade of 1,900 men of Quiot's division. In the centre, Donzelot's division had pushed back Bylandt's brigade. On {{the right of the}} French advance was Marcognet's division led by Grenier's brigade consisting of the 45e Régiment de Ligne and followed by the 25e Régiment de Ligne, somewhat less than 2,000 men, and behind them, Nogue's brigade of the 21e and 45e regiments. Opposing them {{on the other side of}} the road was Pack's 9th Brigade consisting of three Scottish regiments: the Royal Scots, the 42nd Black Watch, the 92nd Gordons and the 44th Foot totaling something over 2,000 men. A very even fight between British and French infantry was about to occur.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1898, Dawson's {{population}} rose further to 30,000 as stampeders arrived over the passes. The centre of the town, Front Street, <b>was</b> <b>lined</b> with hastily built buildings and warehouses, together with log cabins and tents spreading out across {{the rest of the}} settlement. There was no running water or sewerage, and only two springs for drinking water to supplement the increasingly polluted river. In spring, the unpaved streets were churned into thick mud and in summer the settlement reeked of human effluent and was plagued by flies and mosquitoes. Land in Dawson was now scarce, and plots sold for up to $10,000 ($8 million) each; prime locations on Front Street could reach $20,000 ($16 million) while a small log cabin might rent for $100 ($2,700) a month. As a result, Dawson's population spread south into the empty Hän village, renaming it Klondike City. Other communities emerged closer to the mines, such as Granville on Dominion Creek and Grand Forks on Bonanza Creek.|$|E

Doctorates of Philosophy <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> with red faille, Honorary Doctorates <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> with blue satin, Honorary Doctorates honoris causa <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> with blue satin with an edging strip in gold, and Honorary Doctors of the University have hoods lined entirely with gold satin.|$|R
5|$|Recorded dietary {{items include}} sago shoots and insects, {{and it also}} {{swallows}} small stones to help break up its food. It is apparently monogamous, but little else is known of its courtship behaviour. The only known nest was a shallow bowl {{in the top of}} a rotting tree stump that <b>was</b> <b>lined</b> with wood chips and dry leaves. The two young chicks were entirely covered in black down typical of precocial newly hatched rails. The estimated population of 3,500–15,000 birds and the restricted range mean that the invisible rail is classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Habitat loss has occurred through the harvesting of sago and conversion of the wetlands to rice cultivation, and the rail is eaten by local people. The described nest was in an area frequented by local villagers, so the rail may be more adaptable to habitat changes than had been thought.|$|E
5|$|The site abuts a major ancient intersection. Opposite lay a {{large public}} square {{fronting}} the Temple's main Hulda Gates. The Tyropoeon street itself <b>was</b> <b>lined</b> with shops and formed {{part of the}} city's Lower Market. The Royal Stoa, an exceptionally large basilica complex which served various commercial and legal functions, looked down on the intersection from atop the Temple platform. Although the Stoa stood on the Temple esplanade, it was constructed upon an expansion added by Herod. It was therefore evidently not considered sacred by some at the time, allowing it {{to be used for}} mundane activities. The heavy public traffic to and from this edifice accounts for the width of the stepped street, which approximates that of a modern four-lane highway.|$|E
5|$|There {{were three}} {{trenches}} {{in a typical}} front line sector; the fire trench, the support trench and the reserve trench, all joined by communication trenches. The trenches varied in depth, but they were usually {{about four or five}} feet deep, or in areas with a high water table a wall of sandbags would be built to allow the defenders to stand upright, fire trenches were provided with a fire step, so the occupants could return fire during an attack (see diagram). Ideally, the bottom of the trench <b>was</b> <b>lined</b> with duckboards to prevent men from sinking into the mud and dugouts were cut into the walls, these gave shelter from the elements and shrapnel, although in the British Army dugouts were usually reserved for the officers and senior NCOs. The men were then expected to sleep wherever they could and in wet weather they lived under groundsheets or in tents {{at the bottom of the}} trench on the duckboards.|$|E

According to the Tokyo urban {{transportation}} plan, however, it is more complicated. The line number assigned to the section south from Kotake-Mukaihara to Shin-Kiba <b>is</b> <b>Line</b> 8, but that of north of Kotake-Mukaihara to Wakōshi <b>is</b> <b>Line</b> 13, which indicates the section is a portion of Fukutoshin Line which shares the same number.|$|R
5|$|Three {{additional}} system {{models were}} created by other electronics companies. Working with Sega, JVC released the Wondermega on April 1, 1992, in Japan, at an initial retail price of ¥82,800 (or US$620). The system was later redesigned by JVC and released as the X'Eye in North America in September 1994. Designed by JVC to be a Genesis and Sega CD combination with high-quality audio, the Wondermega's high price kept {{it out of the}} hands of average consumers. Likewise was the case with the Pioneer LaserActive, which was also an add-on that required an attachment developed by Sega, known as the Mega-LD pack, in order to play Genesis and Sega CD games. Though the LaserActive, developed by Pioneer Corporation, <b>was</b> <b>lined</b> up to compete with the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, the combined system and Mega-LD pack retailed at nearly $1600, becoming a very expensive option for Sega CD players. Aiwa also released the CSD-GM1, a combination Genesis/Sega CD unit built into a boombox.|$|E
5|$|When Oliver {{arrived in}} Adelaide he started playing for West Suburbans and {{immediately}} began to draw attention from the two largest South Australian Football League (SAFL) clubs, Norwood and Port Adelaide. South Australian businessman Edwin T. Smith was sending Oliver letters asking him to come train with Norwood whilst John Woolard, then captain of Port Adelaide who like Oliver grew up in Broken Hill, was also enquiring about his services. Before Oliver made his debut with Port Adelaide he <b>was</b> <b>lined</b> up with a job shovelling furnace waste. Disgruntled, {{he spoke to the}} Musgrave brothers father who suggested he approach West Torrens and train with them, to which Oliver agreed. Port Adelaide secretary James Hodge prevented this move as Oliver had signed a contract with him shortly beforehand. Hodge later took Oliver out on a fishing trip to resolve the feud and found him a better job.|$|E

The planned Circular Line, Wanda <b>Line,</b> Minsheng-Xizhi <b>Line</b> <b>were</b> to <b>be</b> <b>Lines</b> 6-8 respectively. The system was scrapped in 2016.|$|R
25|$|In the 16th {{century the}} Strand, which connects the City of London with the royal centre of Westminster, <b>was</b> <b>lined</b> with the mansions {{of some of}} England's richest prelates and noblemen.
