40|$|Because of {{the belief}} that the {{rheological}} properties of wheat fl our and dough are related to the flour quality and its processing characteristics, they are of great importance in the baking and milling industries. The Farinograph, Extensograph, Amylograph and Alveograph tests are the most common empirical tests used for assessing rheological properties of wheat dough. Recently, new rheological tool for wheat fl our characterization, called Mixolab, has been developed. The advantage of using Mixolab is that one can measure protein and starch characteristics in a single test. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the relationships between Mixolab parameters and parameters obtained using Farinograph and Amylograph among flour samples of different technological quality. Mixolab <b>water</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>value</b> was significantly correlated to Farinograph <b>water</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>value</b> (r = 0. 9816) as well as Mixolab dough formation time value (time for C 1) to dough development time obtained using Farinograph (r = 0. 9668), while the values which indicate dough stability have not expressed so high correlation (r = 0. 7484). In addition, difference between the values of maximum torque (C 1) and torque at the end of the first period of constant temperature (T= 30 °C) obtained by Mixolab expressed good correlation with the Farinograph degree of softening (r = 0. 8504). A significant correlation coefficient (r = 0. 8812) was determined between the Amylograph peak viscosity parameter and C 3 value which is an indication of starch gelatinization...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, two models based on {{artificial}} neural networks (ANN) and gene expression programming (GEP) for predicting splitting tensile strength and <b>water</b> <b>absorption</b> of concretes containing ZnO 2 nanoparticles at different ages of curing have been developed. To build these models, training and testing using experimental results for 144 specimens produced with 16 different mixture proportions were conducted. The used {{data in the}} multilayer feed forward neural networks models and input variables of genetic programming models are arranged in a format of eight input parameters that cover the cement content (C), nanoparticle content (N), aggregate type (AG), water content (W), the amount of superplasticizer (S), the type of curing medium (CM), Age of curing (AC) and number of testing try (NT). According to these input parameters, in the neural networks and genetic programming models, the splitting tensile strength and <b>water</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>values</b> of concretes containing ZnO 2 nanoparticles were predicted. The training and testing results in these two models have shown the strong potential of the models for predicting the splitting tensile strength and <b>water</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>values</b> of concretes containing ZnO 2 nanoparticles.

40|$|An {{experimental}} setup {{designed to}} capture the saturated surface dry (SSD) state of porous fine aggregates incorporating significant amounts of fines is presented. This setup is validated upon testing fine aggregate sources with different <b>water</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>values</b> up to 5. 6 %, and at least 8 % of fines. Test duration is found to lie in the 120 -to- 240 -min-range, depending on test sample initial mass and water content. Several procedures for calculating the water content in SSD state are presented and discussed. One of these procedures uses the drying theory to fit curves depicting water content shift {{as a function of}} drying time and identify breakpoints. A more straightforward strategy is focused on the transition point between retained and free water on charts representing the variations of water content as a function of relative humidity. In both cases, fairly repeatable and discriminant water content values in SSD state are obtained. As expected, these values are found significantly higher than those determined in the absence of fines according to the usual cone test (CEN, 2014). Moreover the lack of reliability of <b>water</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>values</b> determined in the presence of fines according to the cone test procedure is verified.

Moreover, the method of adding paraffin dispersion within the blender- and the blowline-process on MDF properties was also investigated. For blender-resinated MDF it was found, that adding paraffin dispersion to the fibers before resination leads to lower thickness swelling and <b>water</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>values</b> as well as higher internal bond strength than adding the paraffin dispersion together with the resin to the fibers. Within the blowline-process paraffin dispersion was applied in two different ways. In one method the paraffin dispersion was added to the chips before thermo-mechanical pulping.

40|$|AbstractResearches aim to {{significantly}} increase the operational {{properties of the}} wood materials without compromising on their environmental significance. The possibility of implementing a fundamentally new approach involving filling the free space in the wood fiber structure with such mineral filler particles as nanosized basalt is shown. The research focuses on solving problems concerned with the optimal quantitative ratio selection for the fine mineral components of wood composite, working out the mineral reinforced material prototypes and testing their hydrophysical and fire-technical properties. The proposed method of highly dispersed wood material reinforcing with basalt nanoparticles allows getting highly water- and heat-resistant as well as eco-friendly raw materials.

40|$|In the study, the {{possibility}} to use nepheline-syenite, as fluxing agent, in a body mix used for porcelain stoneware tile, was determined. Starting from the reference mix composition, different amounts, 5. 0, 10. 0 and 15. 6 wt. %, of sodium feldspar were replaced with the same amounts of nepheline-syenite. Different sintering cycles were used to understand {{the role of the}} nepheline-syenite {{in the development of the}} final microstructure. The presence of nepheline-syenite strongly favours the sintering behaviour, by reducing the sintering time necessary to reach the <b>water</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>values,</b> requested by the International Standard. Furthermore, the microstructure results more homogeneous and the mechanical characteristics are increased. The better mechanical performances can also be attributed to the different mineralogical compositions, in particular with lower amount of glassy phase, higher flexural strength values are obtained...|$|R

The presence of residual monomer, as a product of incomplete polymerisation of material, results in more porous structure of the material, which greatly reduces the mechanical and physical quality of the acrylic restorations and increases the absorption of liquids. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the <b>water</b> <b>absorption</b> of different types of resin material. In the study it was assumed that the cold polymerized acrylates show a greater potential for absorbing fluid from the environment in relation to the hot polymerized acrylic. The study included two hot and two cold polymerized acrylates, and cold polymerized acrylate impregnated with aesthetic pearls. In order to determine the degree of <b>water</b> <b>absorption,</b> the mass of the samples was measured before and after one day, seven days and thirty days of immersion in a water bath of body temperature. The tested hot and cold polymerized acrylates after immersion in water bath showed standard <b>values</b> of <b>water</b> <b>absorption.</b> The degree of <b>water</b> <b>absorption</b> was not significantly influenced by the type and manner of polymerisation. <b>Water</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>values</b> were significantly higher after seven days and thirty days of water storage relative to the observational period of one day...|$|R
