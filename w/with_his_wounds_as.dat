60|$|Now that {{my father}} was <b>with</b> us, having <b>his</b> <b>wound</b> <b>as</b> proof that he had taken part in the battle, we could no longer hope to pass {{ourselves}} off as cowards who remained at home while others were fighting for us, and in event of being captured in the city I believed we would receive rougher usage than those taken prisoners on the battle-field.|$|R
6000|$|The Spectre had {{certainly}} the Appearance of Cæsar, <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>Wounds</b> bleeding fresh, <b>as</b> {{if he had}} just receiv'd the fatal Blow; he had reproach'd him <b>with</b> <b>his</b> Ingratitude, <b>with</b> a Tu Brute! tu quoque, mi fili: [...] "What Thou Brutus! Thou, my adopted Son!" [...] Now History seems to agree universally, not only in the Story itself, but in the Circumstances of it; we have only to observe that the Devil {{had certainly}} Power to assume, not a human Shape only, but the Shape of Julius Cæsar in particular.|$|R
60|$|Gradually Mr. Warrington made {{acquaintance}} {{with some of}} the members of the House and the Bar; who, when they came to know him, spoke of him as a young gentleman of good parts and good breeding, and in terms so generally complimentary, that his good uncle's heart relented towards him, and Dora and Flora began once more to smile upon him. This reconciliation dated from the time when his Royal Highness the Duke, after having been defeated by the French, in the affair of Hastenbeck, concluded the famous capitulation with the French, which his Majesty George II. refused to ratify. His Royal Highness, as 'tis well known, flung up his commissions after this disgrace, laid down his commander's baton--which, it must be confessed, he had not wielded with much luck or dexterity--and never again appeared at the head of armies or in public life. The stout warrior would not allow a word of complaint against his father and sovereign to escape his lips; but, <b>as</b> he retired <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>wounded</b> honour, and <b>as</b> he would have no interest or authority more, nor any places to give, it may be supposed that Sir Miles Warrington's anger against his nephew diminished as his respect for his Royal Highness diminished.|$|R

60|$|Never {{was a boy}} better scolded {{than that}} one, for I poured forth vials of wrath upon his head as I took up my {{bleeding}} pet, and pointed to <b>his</b> <b>wounds</b> <b>as</b> indignantly as Antony did to Cæsar's.|$|R

60|$|After {{them came}} the two ladies, escorted by Mr. Langely, who had now so far {{recovered}} from <b>his</b> <b>wound</b> <b>as</b> {{to be able}} to be about with ease, although he still carried his arm in a sling.|$|R
60|$|Donning his {{midshipman}} uniform {{he proceeded}} thither in his uncle's carriage, and walked <b>with</b> crutches--for <b>his</b> <b>wound</b> was not <b>as</b> yet sufficiently healed {{to allow him}} to wear an artificial leg--to the board-room. Here were assembled the first lord and his colleagues. Admiral Nelson was also present, and at once greeted him kindly.|$|R

60|$|He {{moved slowly}} down the trail, still holding Ford's arm confidentially, although, owing to his large {{protecting}} manner, he seemed to offer a ridiculous suggestion of supporting HIM <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>wounded</b> member.|$|R
60|$|<b>With</b> <b>his</b> <b>wound</b> Taug {{had backed}} off {{growling}} horribly. Tarzan had followed him, screaming insults at him, and menacing him <b>with</b> <b>his</b> brandishing blade. Teeka moved {{from beneath the}} tree {{in an effort to}} keep close to the duelists.|$|R
60|$|Here he bandaged <b>his</b> <b>wound</b> <b>as</b> well as possible, and {{was about}} to set out once more in search of aid, when the final retreat was ordered.

60|$|Yes, my poor {{father was}} {{wandering}} in his speech, and very feverish, mixing up Adela and Faith Le Blanc strangely together sometimes, and at others fancying {{he was lying}} ill <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>wound,</b> and sending messages to Faith.|$|R

6000|$|... 'There he is!' cried Ursula, who had {{the sharpest}} eyes. He had not been long under. Birkin pulled towards him, Gudrun following. He swam slowly, and caught hold of the boat <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>wounded</b> hand. It slipped, and he sank back.|$|R
50|$|Albert volunteered {{regularly}} for reconnaissance missions, but on one occasion, {{he was captured}} <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>wounded</b> lieutenant.

60|$|Phonny was {{confined}} {{nearly a week}} <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>wound.</b> They moved the sofa on which he was lying up into {{a corner of the}} room, near Mrs. Henry's window, and there Stuyvesant and Malleville brought various things to him to amuse him.|$|R
60|$|Having {{completed}} their toilet the three friends sat at their table and sipped their ale and wine in comparative {{silence for a}} time.

60|$|Now that affairs were {{in their}} own hands, our friends hardly knew how to turn next. After a {{discussion}} it was agreed to place the Flyaway in charge of Dick and Tom, who were also to carry Dora and Mumps. All of the others went aboard of the Searchlight, Arnold Baxter being carried by the police officers, who attended to <b>his</b> <b>wound</b> <b>as</b> well as the accommodations on board of the yacht permitted.|$|R
50|$|In {{his final}} moments, the policewoman who first comes upon John touches {{his head to}} examine <b>his</b> <b>wounds</b> and strokes <b>his</b> <b>wounded</b> {{forehead}} <b>as</b> he dies from the clubbing. It {{may have been the}} only gentle touch that John has known.|$|R
60|$|During {{the melee}} Butzow regained consciousness; <b>his</b> <b>wound</b> being <b>as</b> {{superficial}} {{as that of}} the American, the two men were soon donning their clothing, and, half-dressed, rushing toward the outer gate.|$|R

5000|$|Two {{different}} versions of the formal pardon exist; in one, the culprit is identified as [...] "François des Loges, autrement dit Villon" [...] ("François des Loges, otherwise called Villon"), in the other as [...] "François de Montcorbier."

60|$|The {{order for}} 'Mr. Trysail!' 'the captain calls the master!' passed {{in a low}} call from mouth to mouth, but it was unanswered. A seaman told the expecting young commander, that the surgeon desired his {{presence}} forward. A gleaming of lights and a little group {{at the foot of}} the fore-mast, was a beacon not to be mistaken. The weatherbeaten master was in the agony; and his medical attendant had just risen from a fruitless examination of <b>his</b> <b>wounds,</b> <b>as</b> Ludlow approached.|$|R
50|$|Roman philosopher Cicero praised Pacuvius' play Niptra, {{which was}} an {{imitation}} of Sophocles' Odysseus Acanthoplex, because in Pacuvius' play Odysseus does not lament <b>his</b> <b>wounds</b> excessively, <b>as</b> Cicero believed the character did in Sophocles' play.|$|R
50|$|The {{most highly}} {{decorated}} {{member of the}} battalion was the chaplain, Honorary Captain the Reverend John Foote, who remained at Dieppe <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>wounded</b> and captured comrades rather than accept evacuation to Britain.

50|$|King died on October 9, 1903, {{four days}} before the War Department mailed out a letter announcing the {{rejection}} of his medal nomination.

60|$|Since Harvey {{was really}} {{the leader of the}} expedition, the others could do no more than advise against his {{engaging}} in work, and he led the way, seated on the saddle, <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>wounded</b> leg fastened to the pommel in such a manner {{that it would not be}} injured by the trees while they were passing through the woods.|$|R
