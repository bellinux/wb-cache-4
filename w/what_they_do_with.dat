500|$|Nick Offerman {{received}} considerable {{praise for}} his performance as Ron Swanson {{during the second}} season. Many reviewers praised Offerman's subtle and understated style of comedy, {{and said he was}} often the funniest part of the scenes he was in. Jonah Weiner of Slate magazine declared Swanson [...] "Parks and Recreations secret weapon" [...] and [...] "vital to the show's improvement". Aziz Ansari, who was particularly acclaimed during the first season for his role as Tom Haverford, received similar praise in the second season as well. Many reviewers were critical of the pairing of Mark and Ann, feeling the couple lacked chemistry and were often the least funny parts of the individual episodes. Entertainment Weekly writer Margaret Lyons called Mark and Ann the show's [...] "Achilles' heel", and Sandra Gonzalez, also from Entertainment Weekly, wrote, [...] "No matter <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> these two, I can’t help but be bored." ...|$|E

The demonstrators shouted anti-war slogans and displayed signs reading [...] "U.S. hands off Libya," [...] "Foreclose the war, not people’s homes," [...] and [...] "Say no to U.S. war against Libya". A statement issued by organizers said, [...] "Eight years {{after the start of}} the war in Iraq, the U.S. has launched a new war in the Middle East, this time against Libya. This is not a 'humanitarian intervention.' This is a war launched to try to control the oil resources of the region". Meredith Aby of the Anti-War Committee (AWC) told the crowd, [...] "Obama doesn’t have the right to decide for the Libyan people who their leader is or <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> their oil.

I'm pretty certain, though, you won't meet any of them in this hotel; they couldn't afford it, and I fancy they would find themselves out of their element among our guests. We respect them thoroughly; every American does, and we know that the prosperity of the country rests with them; we have a theory that they are politically sovereign, but we see very little of them, and we don't associate with them. In fact, our cultivated people have so little interest in them socially that they don't like to meet them, even in fiction; they prefer refined and polished ladies and gentlemen, whom they can have some sympathy with; and I always go to the upper classes for my types. It won't do to suppose, though, that we are indifferent to the working classes in their place. Their condition is being studied a good deal just now, and there are several persons here who will be able to satisfy your curiosity on the points you have made, I think.

6000|$|I {{know that}} in thus putting all the {{importance}} upon educational needs {{at the present time}} I shall seem to many readers to be ignoring quite excessively the profound racial, social and economic conflicts that are in progress. I do. I believe we shall never get on with human affairs until we do ignore them. I offer no suggestion whatever as to what sides people should take in such an issue as that between France and Germany or between Sinn Fein and the British Government, or in the class war. I offer no such suggestion because I believe that all these conflicts and all such current conflicts are so irrational and destructive that it is impossible for a sane man who wishes to serve the world to identify himself with either side in any of them. These conflicts are mere aspects of the gross and passionate stupidity and ignorance and sectionalism of our present world. The class war, the push for and the resistance to some vague reorganization called the Social Revolution--such things are the natural inevitable result of the sordid moral and intellectual muddle of our common ideas about property. The capitalist, the employer, the property-owning class, as a class, have neither the intelligence nor the conscience to comprehend any moral limitations, any limitations whatever but the strong arm of the law, upon <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> their property. Their black and obstinate ignorance, the clumsy adventurousness they call private enterprise, their unconscious insolence to poor people, their stupidly conspicuous self-indulgence, produce as a necessary result the black hatred of the employed and the expropriated. On one side we have greed, insensibility and incapacity, on the other envy and suffering stung to vindictive revolt: on neither side light nor generosity nor creative will. Neither side has any power to give us any reality we need. Neither side is more than a hate and an aggression. How can one take sides between them? ...|$|E
6000|$|They {{wanted this}} singleness of heart in their fasting, {{and in their}} eating, in their mourning, and in their drinking; they had double hearts in what they did. They did not as the apostle bids; [...] "whether ye eat or drink, or {{whatsoever}} ye do, do all to the glory of God." [...] And the reason of their want of this thing was, they wanted this fear of God; for that, as the apostle here saith, effecteth singleness of heart to God, and makes a man, as John said of Gaius, [...] "do faithfully whatsoever he doth" [...] (3 John 5). And the reason is, as hath been already urged, for that grace of fear of God retaineth and keepeth upon the heart a reverent and awful sense of the dread majesty and all-seeing eye of God, also a due consideration of the day of account before him; it likewise maketh his service sweet and pleasing, and fortifies the soul against all discouragements; by this means, I say, the soul, in its service to God or man, is not so soon captivated as where there is not this fear, but through and by it its service is accepted, being single, sincere, simple, and faithful; when others, with what they do, are cast into hell for their hypocrisy, for they mix not <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> godly fear. Singleness of heart {{in the service of}} God is of such absolute necessity, that without it, as I have hinted, nothing can be accepted; because where that is wanting, there wanteth love to God, and to that which is true holiness indeed. It was this singleness of heart that made Nathanael so honourable in the eyes of Jesus Christ. [...] "Behold," [...] said he, [...] "an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no guile" [...] (John 1:47). And it was the want of it that made him so much abhor the Pharisees. They wanted sincerity, simplicity, and godly sincerity in their souls, and so became an abhorrence in his esteem. Now, I say, this golden grace, singleness of heart, it flows from this godly fear of God.|$|E
