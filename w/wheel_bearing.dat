25|$|For , Williams had {{the quickest}} and most {{reliable}} car, the FW18. Coulthard had left Williams to join Mika Häkkinen at McLaren, and Williams replaced him with Canadian Jacques Villeneuve, {{who had won}} the CART series title in 1995, while Hill remained with the team. Schumacher left Benetton to join Ferrari. Williams won the first five Grands Prix, Hill winning {{all but one of}} them. Olivier Panis would take victory at the sixth round in Monaco after both Williams cars retired. Hill would retire {{for the second time in}} a row after he spun-off in Spain, while his teammate, Villeneuve, took third place. Hill and Villeneuve dominated the next Grand Prix in Canada, with a 1–2 in qualifying and a 1–2 finish. Williams made it a second 1–2 after Hill won the French Grand Prix. Villeneuve won his second race in F1 at Silverstone after Hill retired with a <b>wheel</b> <b>bearing</b> failure on lap 26. Hill was victorious in the next Grand Prix in Germany while Villeneuve won the race after that in Hungary. Schumacher's Ferrari would then take the next two Grands Prix at Spa-Francorchamps and Monza. Villeneuve mounted a title challenge going into the final race of the season at Japan, but Hill reasserted his dominance to take the race and the 1996 title, while Villeneuve lost a wheel and retired.|$|E
500|$|For {{the race}} itself, {{mechanical}} problems appeared early as Thompson's car suffered after only three laps. [...] The fuel system was not providing enough Jet A to the turbine {{to allow it}} to produce its full power output, meaning the car had to limp down the circuit's long straights. [...] While that car continued at a slowed pace, the other suffered a <b>wheel</b> <b>bearing</b> failure two hours later, requiring a lengthy three-hour repair. [...] By the sixth hour of the event the car was disqualified by race officials, having covered an insufficient distance of only 60 laps. [...] The remaining fuel-starved TX did not last much longer as Thompson crashed in the Indianapolis corner.|$|E

500|$|... 1985 {{was a year}} {{in which}} Martini Racing needed to show the {{potential}} winning capabilities of the LC2 in order for Lancia to continue to fund a project that had seen limited success thus far. [...] The cars were further revised and were running on Michelin radial tyres. The season opened with an LC2 taking pole position at Mugello by 1.7 seconds ahead of the factory Porsche. [...] Although the pole position car's engine did not last, the other team car finished fourth. [...] For the 1000km of Monza, the LC2s were nearly four seconds ahead of the closest Porsche in qualifying, and led the race early on. [...] However, while Patrese and Nannini were in third place and on the same lap as the leaders, a tree fell across the track and caused the race to be stopped early. [...] On pole once again at Silverstone, one of the LC2s was in the lead of the race until a <b>wheel</b> <b>bearing</b> failure in the closing laps forced Nannini to pit, forfeiting the lead. [...] Although the LC2s did not take pole at Le Mans, they lead the race early. [...] Reliability issues again forced the team {{to drop out of the}} lead. [...] They eventually finished the race in sixth and seventh places. [...] A fuel pump failure also dropped the team out of contention at the Hockenheimring.|$|E
2500|$|Aside {{from the}} {{materials}} {{they are made}} of, bits can be classified as edge bits or non-edge bits, and whether the bit {{is designed to be}} anti-kickback. Edge bits have a small <b>wheel</b> <b>bearing</b> to act as a fence against the work in making edge moldings. These bearings can be changed by using commercially available bearing kits. Changing the bearing, in effect, changes the diameter of the cutting edge. This is especially important with rabbeting/rebating bits. Non-edge bits require the use of a fence, either on a router table or attached to the work or router. [...] Anti-kickback bits employ added non-cutting bit material around the circumference of the bit's shoulders which serves to limit feed-rate. This reduces the chance that the workpiece is pushed too deeply into the bit (which would result in significant kickback from the cutting edge being unable to compensate).|$|E
2500|$|The dog is a {{spring-loaded}} arm pivoted on {{the outside}} of the lock plate. A sparking material, usually a small piece of iron pyrite, is clamped and held by vice-like jaws at the swinging end of the arm. The dog has two possible positions to which it can be pivoted by hand: a [...] "safe" [...] position, in which the dog is pushed towards the muzzle of the firearm, and an [...] "operating" [...] position, where the dog is pulled towards the operator so that the pyrite in its jaws can engage either the top of the pan cover (see below), or (in the absence of the pan cover) the edge of a steel <b>wheel</b> <b>bearing</b> longitudinal grooves around its circumference. Flint is not suitable as a sparking material in the wheellock because it is too hard and would quickly wear away the wheel grooves.|$|E

2500|$|The grooved {{trolley wheel}} was used on many large city systems through the 1940s and 1950s; it was {{generally}} used on systems with [...] "old" [...] style round cross sectional overhead wire. The trolley wheel was problematic at best; the circumferential contact of the grooved <b>wheel</b> <b>bearing</b> {{on the underside of}} the overhead wire provided minimal electrical contact and tended to arc excessively, increasing overhead wire wear [...] The newer sliding carbon trolley shoe was generally used with a newer grooved overhead trolley wire of a roughly [...] "figure 8" [...] cross section. The sliding trolley shoe provided better electrical contact (with a reduction in arcing), and it dramatically reduced overhead wire wear. Many systems began converting to the sliding trolley shoe in the 1920s; Milwaukee, Wisconsin converted its large system in the late 1920s. Curiously, Philadelphia did not convert its trolley wheels on its remaining streetcars until 1978. Although a streetcar with a trolley wheel may evoke an antique look, the trolley shoe is modern and more practical as well as economical.|$|E

50|$|In 1974, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in {{collaboration}} with the Swiss watch industry standards organization NIHS: Normes de l'Industrie Horlogère Suisse published a standard, ISO 1112, which prohibited manufacturers from including such nonfunctional jewels in the jewel counts in advertising and sales literature. This put a stop to the use of totally nonfunctional jewels. However, some experts say manufacturers have continued to inflate the jewel count of their watches by 'upjeweling'; adding functional jeweled <b>bearings</b> to <b>wheels</b> that do not really need them, exploiting loopholes in ISO 1112. Examples given include adding capstones to third and fourth <b>wheel</b> <b>bearings,</b> jeweling minute <b>wheel</b> <b>bearings,</b> and automatic winding ratchet pawls.
