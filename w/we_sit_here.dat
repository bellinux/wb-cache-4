If we say: [...] "We will enter into the city," [...] then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there; and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us go to the host of the Arameans; if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die,’" [...] and [...] "And there was a famine in the land; and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there," [...] the Rabbis deduced that when there is a famine a place, one should migrate elsewhere. And the Gemara taught that the Rabbis cited [...] in addition to [...] because one might think from [...] that this advice applies only where there is no danger to life in the destination. So they also cited [...] "Now therefore come, and let us go to the host of the Arameans; if they save us alive, we shall live.". Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 2001[...]|$|E

6000|$|... "Shall <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> <b>here</b> {{and rest}} for a few minutes?" [...] he said at length, as they came to an old bench on the cliff {{overlooking}} the sea.|$|E
6000|$|... "Carlos, let us <b>sit</b> down <b>here</b> {{a minute}} or two till we can think what we had better do. <b>We</b> can <b>sit</b> <b>here,</b> I know. These benches must be for any body." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Time we {{was going}} in, O' Party," [...] said Mr. Polly, {{standing}} up. [...] "Supper to get. It's as you say, <b>we</b> can't <b>sit</b> <b>here</b> for ever." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Let us {{stay here}} with her,' Knight whispered, and turning said, 'No; <b>we</b> will <b>sit</b> <b>here.</b> <b>We</b> want to rest and dry {{ourselves}} here for a time, if you please.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{never been}} out on a roof before," [...] said the old lady. [...] "I'm all disconnected. It's very bumpy. Especially that last bit. Can't <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> <b>here</b> for a bit and rest? I'm not the girl I useto be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{all right}} now," [...] Jumbo said; [...] "dey no attack us here any more; like enough dey wait and lie in ambush in grass, {{in case we}} move away; but we not do that; <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> <b>here</b> quietly till the caravan arrive." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{there is}} no hurry," [...] she whispered. [...] "Can't <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> <b>here</b> and talk for a little time, or go further back into the wood? I know a most {{delightful}} little hiding-place just {{at the top of}} the slate pit--an old keeper's shelter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nor I," [...] said Rollo; [...] "but <b>we</b> can <b>sit</b> <b>here</b> {{a little}} while, and perhaps {{somebody}} {{will come and}} speak to us. It must be right for us to <b>sit</b> <b>here,</b> for other ladies and gentlemen are sitting in this cabin." ...|$|R
6000|$|So great her absentmindedness she droops as in a swoon, And a {{movement}} of aversion mars her recent spousal grace, And in silence <b>we</b> two <b>sit</b> <b>here</b> in our waning honeymoon [...] At this idle watering-place [...] .|$|R
6000|$|... "Grandpapa {{does not}} like moving," [...] said Caroline, as she {{got up to leave}} the room after dinner; [...] "so perhaps, Sir Henry, you will allow me to come down to tea <b>here?</b> <b>We</b> always <b>sit</b> <b>here</b> of an evening." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I am," [...] I said, {{laughing}} softly. [...] "It doesn't {{matter in}} me, because I'm {{so easy to}} thaw. You ought to know that. Oh, Miss Bowater, think if this were summer time and the dew and the first burning heat! Are you wrapped up? And shall <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> <b>here,</b> just--just for one dance of the Sisters: thou lost dove, Merope?" ...|$|E
60|$|MITCHENER. Lady Corinthia: {{you have}} my pistol. Will you have the {{goodness}} to blow my brains out. I should prefer it to any further effort to follow the gyrations of the weathercock you no doubt call your mind. If you refuse, then I warn you that youll not get another word out of me--not if <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> <b>here</b> until doomsday.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Perhaps {{everything}} {{ought to}} be broken up. But I say nothing about that. What I do say is this. That as <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> <b>here</b> as directors and will be held to be responsible as such by the public, we ought {{to know what is}} being done. We ought to know where the shares really are. I for one do not even know what scrip has been issued.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing," [...] he replied, [...] "that need worry you, I think. Shall <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> down <b>here?</b> You won't catch cold?" [...] and he {{indicated}} a seat well sheltered {{against the cold}} breeze and the impertinent gaze of the passers-by.|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought," [...] {{she began}} hesitatingly, [...] "that {{it would be}} more cheerful for you in here, this stormy evening. I thought you might like to put your wet things to dry in the kitchen, and <b>we</b> could <b>sit</b> <b>here</b> together, after supper, alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{where have}} they gone?" [...] I cried. [...] "This is unworthy of you, Mordaunt. What right have <b>we</b> to <b>sit</b> <b>here,</b> {{allowing}} our private feelings to overcome us, {{while there is}} a possibility of succouring your father? Up, man! Let us follow him. Tell me only what direction he took." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "History," [...] Selingman continued, heaping {{his plate}} with rich cakes, [...] "has been made before now in strange places. Why not here? <b>We</b> <b>sit</b> <b>here</b> in close touch {{with one of}} the most {{interesting}} phases of modern life. We can even hear the voice of fate, the click of the little ball as it finishes its momentous journey and sinks to rest. Why should we, too, not speak of fateful things?" ...|$|E
60|$|HECTOR. But I have children. All that is {{over and}} done with for me: and yet I too feel that this can't last. <b>We</b> <b>sit</b> <b>here</b> talking, and leave {{everything}} to Mangan and to chance and to the devil. Think of the powers of destruction that Mangan and his mutual admiration gang wield! It's madness: it's like giving a torpedo to a badly brought up child to play at earthquakes with.|$|E
6000|$|... "If you endanger other people's {{life and}} liberty in your pursuit of happiness, I {{shall have to}} {{confiscate}} your arms, boys. Take the orchard for your archery ground; that is safe, {{and we can see}} you as <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> <b>here.</b> I wish I had two hands, so that I could paint you a fine, gay target;" [...] and Miss Celia looked regretfully at the injured arm, which as yet was of little use.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} not, Bertie. We all feel brave in dangers {{that we are}} {{accustomed}} to; it is what we don't know that frightens us. <b>We</b> will <b>sit</b> <b>here</b> on the window-sill for another five minutes before we move again. José, you have got some pulque in your gourd, I suppose?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ten days," [...] I said; [...] "that leaves--" [...] I {{looked up}} at the sun for a moment, and then saw that it was halfway from the zenith to the western edge of things. [...] "Four days! ... Cavor, <b>we</b> mustn't <b>sit</b> <b>here</b> and dream. How do you think we may begin?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, can't <b>we</b> just <b>sit</b> <b>here</b> and be quiet?" [...] she pleaded, but {{he rubbed}} his chin {{and shook his head}} and sputtered: [...] "Oh, rats, you can't see the river, now that they've turned on the {{electric}} lights here. Come on. Besides, it'll be cooler right by the river." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd rather not," [...] she admitted. [...] "My {{brain is}} too full. I have a hundred fancies dancing about. I even find myself, as <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> <b>here,</b> rehearsing my gestures, tuning {{myself to a}} new outlook. Oh! You most {{disturbing}} person--intellectually of course, I mean," [...] she added, laughing into his face. [...] "Take off my rugs and help me up. No, we'll leave them there. Perhaps, after dinner, we might walk for a little time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no, no," [...] said he. [...] "You ain't a {{reporter}}. Reporters don't {{talk that}} way. They {{pretend to be}} one of us, and say they've just got in on the blind baggage from St. Louis. I can tell a reporter on sight. Us park bums get to be fine judges of human nature. <b>We</b> <b>sit</b> <b>here</b> all day and watch the people go by. I can size up anybody who walks past my bench {{in a way that would}} surprise you." ...|$|E
6000|$|Nay but, my lord the Duke, be generous; While <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> <b>here</b> {{within a}} noble house [With shaded porticoes against the sun, And walls and roofs {{to keep the}} winter out], There are many {{citizens}} of Padua Who in vile tenements live so full of holes, That the chill rain, the snow, and the rude blast, Are tenants also with them; others sleep Under the arches of the public bridges All through the autumn nights, till the wet mist Stiffens their limbs, and fevers come, and so - ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Plop, sir! Mrs. Butt is drying my uniform {{at home at}} {{this very}} moment as <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> talking <b>here,</b> sir. She says to me, 'Why, {{whatever}} 'ave you been a-doing? You're all wet.' And," [...] he added, again with the confidential air, [...] "I was wet, too. Wringin' wet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no!" [...] I answered. [...] "I {{know that}} you did not--that you could not..." [...] And then I leaped to my feet. [...] "And <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> talking <b>here,</b> whilst this... whilst this... O God!" [...] I sobbed. [...] "We may yet be in time. To horse, then! Let us away!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't condemn {{you at all}} but {{it makes}} me sad," [...] she slowly replied. [...] "You are wasting your life {{out there in the}} wild country--oh, isn't it strange that <b>we</b> should <b>sit</b> <b>here?</b> My mind is so busy with the wonder of it I can't talk straight. I had given up ever seeing you again----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, we 'll {{think of}} that as <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> <b>here</b> alone," [...] she rejoined. [...] "Mary and I will sit here and talk about it. So I give him up," [...] she went on, as he was going. [...] "I 'm sure you 'll be {{the best of friends}} to him, but if you should ever forget him, or grow tired of him, or lose your {{interest}} in him, and he should come to any harm or any trouble, please, sir, remember"--And she paused, with a tremulous voice.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not really}} studying," [...] said Cyrilla, tossing the book away. [...] "I'm only pretending to. I'm really just as bored and lonesome as you are. But {{what else is}} there to do? We can't stir outside the door; we've nothing to read; we can't make candy since Mrs. Plunkett has {{forbidden}} us to use the oil stove in our room; we'll probably quarrel all round if <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> <b>here</b> in idleness; so I've been trying to brush up my Greek verbs by way of keeping out of mischief. Have you any better employment to offer me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We cannot come," [...] Selingman declared, without hesitation. [...] "I take {{my friend}} Maraton somewhere. As <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> <b>here,</b> Mr. Foley, we have spoken of politics. You {{are a great}} man. If any one can lift your country from the rut along which she is travelling, you will do it. A Unionist Prime Minister and you hold out the hand to Maraton! But what foresight! What acumen! You see beyond the thunder-clouds {{the things that we}} have seen. Not only do you see them, but you have the courage to follow your convictions. What a mess you are making of Parties!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{decision}} relieves my mind," [...] {{her companion}} declared, as he arranged the cushions behind her back. [...] "I rather fancy {{myself with a}} pair of sculls, but a punt-pole never appealed to me. <b>We</b> will <b>sit</b> <b>here</b> and enjoy the peace. To-morrow night you will find it all disturbed--music and raucous voices and the stampede of my poor, frightened horses in the park. This is really a very gracious silence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Like it! With a real {{house and}} {{something}} to keep my hands busy! And maybe a kitty! And I would make you tea (I'm so tired of hotel food!) and <b>we</b> would <b>sit</b> out <b>here</b> on the porch--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Wife, we will try, {{though to}} see such high visions the spirit should be calm, which I fear yours is not--nay, be not angry. We will try, <b>we</b> will try. <b>Sit</b> <b>here</b> now, and gaze, and above all be silent while I say the {{appropriate}} spells." ...|$|R
