50|$|Some governments {{restrict}} the languages {{that can be}} used in advertisements, but advertisers may employ tricks to try avoiding them.

5000|$|Verb phrases are {{sometimes}} defined more narrowly in scope, in effect admitting only those elements considered as strictly verbal to compose verb phrases, which, accordingly, would consist only of main and auxiliary verbs, plus infinitive or participle constructions.

30|$|The {{abovementioned}} {{three layers}} are complementary and not independent. Typography {{can be applied}} to both the logical and the layout layers of a document. For example, a footnote (logical layer) can be a sentence or paragraph in italics or in smaller font size than the body of the text. The vertical space in a text block, called leading (layout layer), can be affected by the font type. Moreover, typography {{can be applied to}} the body of the text directly. For example, a <b>word</b> <b>in</b> <b>bold</b> can be used either for the introduction of a new term, to indicate a person’s name, or a sentence <b>in</b> <b>bold</b> can be the definition of a term. In this work, we study the typography only; thus, the other two layers (logical and layout) are ignored.|$|R
50|$|The light verbs are underlined, and the <b>words</b> <b>in</b> <b>bold</b> {{together}} {{constitute the}} light verb constructions. Each of these constructions is the (primary {{part of the}}) main predicate of the sentence. Note that the determiner a is usually NOT part of the light verb construction. We {{know that it is}} not part of the light verb construction because it is variable, e.g. I took a long/the first/two/the best nap. The light verb contributes little content to its sentence; the main meaning resides with the noun in bold.|$|E
50|$|The <b>words</b> <b>in</b> <b>bold</b> {{are called}} phrases since {{they appear in}} the {{syntactic}} positions where multiple-word phrases (i.e. traditional phrases) can appear. This practice takes the constellation to be primitive rather than the words themselves. The word he, for instance, functions as a pronoun, but within the sentence it also functions as a noun phrase. The phrase structure grammars of the Chomskyan tradition (government and binding theory and the minimalist program) are primary examples of theories that apply this understanding of phrases. Other grammars, for instance dependency grammars, are likely to reject this approach to phrases, since they take the words themselves to be primitive. For them, phrases must contain two or more words.|$|E
5000|$|From {{the time}} of Peter Lombard on, the {{prevailing}} theology of the Catholic Church considered the eight <b>words</b> <b>in</b> <b>bold</b> above {{to be on their}} own the necessary and sufficient [...] "sacramental form" [...] of the Eucharist. Pope Eugene IVs Decree for the Armenians, issued after the Council of Florence, declared: [...] "The words of the Savior, by which He instituted this sacrament, are the form of this sacrament; for the priest speaking in the person of Christ effects this sacrament. For by the power of the very words the substance of the bread is changed into the body of Christ, and the substance of the wine into the blood". The Decree did not limit the words to the eight in bold, but was popularly taken to mean that, on their own, they are all that is needed for effecting the sacrament. The Decree also declared that the matter of ordination was the giving to the ordinand of objects connected with their ministry, an idea now discarded and even then contradicted by the Catholic Churchs recognition of the validity of ordinations in Churches that had no such ceremony in their rite of ordination.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine {{differences}} between happy and unhappy people, with respect to individuals interpretations, their attributonal style and in what way the priming effect is related to their attributional style and well-being. The participants were 74 senior high school and 21 undergraduate college students. Participants were asked to read a short story, some words were in bold type, and thereafter for their subjective perception of the <b>words</b> <b>in</b> <b>bold</b> type loading and memory of them in a recognition list. Attributional style was operationalized with an own constructed instrument. The results show that happy individuals interpreted more words as positive than negative in comparission with unhappy individuals. No correlation between participants well-being and global or attributional style for negative events were found. Both groups showed a tendency to be more optimistic than pessimstic for positive events. No differences were found for either memory or priming of loaded words. In sum the results suggest that happy individuals tend to conceive the world more positive...|$|E

40|$|Persons with aphasia (PWAs) often {{demonstrate}} {{challenges in}} the areas of expressive language, comprehension, reading, and writing. Due to these deficits, PWAs have limited opportunity to express their opinions and contribute to treatment planning. This project focused on the development of a self-report needs assessment tool for PWAs that facilitates PWAs participation in treatment planning. The needs assessment tool was designed using aphasia-friendly features including pictographic/visual analog scale, key <b>words</b> <b>in</b> <b>bold,</b> simple wording, large font, consistent question formatting, flexible administration, and the use of a communication partner/interview. The needs assessment tool was administered to seven PWAs in the Bowling Green, Kentucky area. Participants were recruited from short-term rehabilitation facilities, long-term care facilities, and personal homes. The needs assessment tool is comprised of 12 items targeting interest in therapeutic offerings for inclusion in a new intensive comprehensive aphasia program (ICAP). Results revealed the importance of flexible administration in response to participants’ communication abilities and limitations. With use of communicative support, the needs assessment tool provided an opportunity for PWAs to effectively express treatment preferences. Participants indicated moderate interest in an ICAP at Western Kentucky University and treatment options including individual speech and language therapy, physical therapy, and community outings...|$|E
40|$|The packet {{includes}} general back-ground {{information about}} ancient Egypt, the culture, the people, and their religious beliefs. It is intend-ed {{for teachers of}} all grade levels but requires adaptation for specific learning levels. In addition, the packet focuses on six specific works providing information about the objects and suggesting activities that relate directly to math, language arts, science, social studies, and fine arts. <b>Words</b> <b>in</b> <b>bold</b> print are defined in the glossary {{at the end of}} this section. You will also find a bibliography that includes resources for teachers and students. We hope that this packet will assist you in preparing your students for their visit to the exhibition. You may also want to visit Inside Egypt, an exciting new addition to the Experiencenter, The Dayton Art Institute's interactive gallery. Through hands-on activities, students will learn about the building of the Great Pyramids at Giza, write coded messages in hieroglyphs, and make drawings like the ancient Egyptians. A tactile diagram of a cross-section view of the Great Pyramid, accompanied by an audio description and braille text, will assist blind visitors and those with low vision. In addition, several activities will make direct connections to ancient Egyptian objects from the museum’s permanent collection. Inside Egypt is on view May 21, 2005 through April, 2006. The Experiencenter is open every day and is free to the public. Inside Egypt is sponsored b...|$|E
