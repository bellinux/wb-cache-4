These sales efforts were aimed {{primarily}} at countries being run by dictatorships or similar, a fact that led to serious concerns in parliament. These efforts also led to a scandal when it was discovered millions of dollars {{had been given to}} foreign sales agents, with little or no record of who they were, or <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>to</b> earn the money. This led to a Royal Canadian Mounted Police investigation after questions were raised about sales efforts in Argentina, and new regulations on full disclosure of fees for future sales.|$|E

As the pain intensified, Litvinenko asked his wife to call an ambulance for assistance. For several weeks, Litvinenko's condition worsened as doctors searched {{for the cause of}} the illness.

With Samson's consent, they tied him with two new ropes and were about to hand {{him over to the}} Philistines when he broke free of the ropes. Using the jawbone of a donkey, he slew 1,000 Philistines.|$|E

500|$|On February 21, 1989, former Neshoba County sheriff Lawrence A. Rainey filed {{a lawsuit}} against Orion Pictures, {{claiming}} defamation and invasion of privacy. The lawsuit, filed at a United States district court in Meridian, Mississippi, asked for $8 million in damages. Rainey, who was the county sheriff {{at the time of the}} 1964 murders, alleged that the filmmakers of Mississippi Burning had portrayed him in an unfavorable light with the fictional character of Sheriff Ray Stuckey (Gailard Sartain). [...] "Everybody all over the South knows the one they have playing the sheriff in that movie is referring to me," [...] he stated. [...] "What they said happened and <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>to</b> me certainly wasn't right and something ought to be done about it." [...] Rainey's lawsuit was unsuccessful; he dropped the suit after Orion's team of lawyers threatened to prove that the film was based on fact, and that Rainey was indeed suspected in the 1964 murders.|$|E

2500|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} the {{generation}} of the dispersion has no portion {{in the world to}} come.. The Gemara asked <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>to</b> justify this punishment. The scholars of the academy of Rav Shila taught that they sought to build a tower, ascend to heaven, and cleave it with axes, that its waters might gush forth. In the academies of the Land of Israel, they laughed at this, arguing that if {{the generation of}} the dispersion had sought to do so, they should have built the tower on a mountain. Rabbi Jeremiah bar Eleazar taught that the generation of the dispersion split into three parties. One party sought to ascend to heaven and dwell there. The second party sought to ascend to heaven and serve idols. And the third party sought to ascend and wage war with God. God scattered the party that proposed to ascend and dwell there. God turned into apes, spirits, devils, and night-demons the party that sought to ascend and wage war with God. As for the party that sought to ascend and serve idols, God responded, in the words of [...] "for there the Lord did confound the language of all the earth." [...] It was taught in a Baraita that Rabbi Nathan said that the generation of the dispersion were all bent on idolatry. For [...] says, [...] "let us make us a name," [...] while [...] says, [...] "and make no mention of the name of other gods." [...] Rabbi Nathan reasoned that just as the word [...] "name" [...] indicates idolatry in [...] so does the word [...] "name" [...] in [...] Rabbi Jonathan taught that a third of the tower was burned, a third sank into the earth, and a third still stood at his time. Rav taught that the atmosphere of the tower caused forgetfulness. Rav Joseph taugh that Babylon and the neighboring city of Borsif were both evil omens for the Torah, because one soon forgets one's learning there. Rabbi Assi said that the name [...] "Borsif" [...] means [...] "an empty pit" [...] (bor shafi), for it empties one of knowledge..|$|E
