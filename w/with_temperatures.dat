5|$|The 53rd {{edition of}} the annual Gator Bowl game kicked off on January 1, 1998. An {{estimated}} 54,116 fans were in attendance at the game, which was held in Jacksonville's Alltel Stadium, since renamed Jacksonville Municipal Stadium. The game was televised on NBC, and an estimated 5.1 million Americans watched the broadcast, giving the game a television rating of 3.7, 12th highest of the 21 bowl games that season. Charlie Jones, Bob Trumpy, John Dockery were the sportscasters of the broadcast. During the week prior to the game, the weather had been cold and rainy, <b>with</b> <b>temperatures</b> in the mid-40s and more than two inches of rain.

5|$|B.brownii occurs between Albany (35°S) and the Stirling Range (34°24'S) in the {{southwest}} of Western Australia, at the juncture of the Esperance Plains, Warren and Jarrah Forest biogeographic regions. This is the taxonomically richest area for Banksia, with 19 species, of which six are endemic, including B.brownii itself. It is cool and wet, <b>with</b> <b>temperatures</b> between four and 30°C (39–86°F) and rainfall of around 800 millimetres (31in). The species occurs there in two distinct population clusters: southern populations occur among low woodland of Eucalyptus marginata (jarrah) in shallow, nutrient-poor white or grey sand over laterite; Stirling Range populations occur at altitudes of between 500 and 1100 metres (1640–3960ft), among heath on rocky mountain slopes and tops, and in shale in gullies.|$|E
5|$|In {{east central}} Florida, a warm sector, {{a region of}} warm surface air between a cold front and a warm front, was {{positioned}} ahead of a progressing cold front.

5|$|The {{climate of}} Strandzha is {{influenced}} by the proximity of the Black, Marmara and Aegean seas which clearly distinguishes the local climate from that of the rest of Bulgaria. The region is among the warmest in the country <b>with</b> <b>temperatures</b> rarely falling below 0°C in winter and rising above 24°C in summer due to the cooling effect of the Black Sea. The average temperature drops with the rising elevation in the interior which creates conditions for more frequent and longer-lasting mists, heavier snowfall and earlier frosts.

5|$|The {{composition}} of the clouds varies with depth and increasing pressure.

5|$|Uttar Pradesh has a humid {{subtropical}} climate and experiences four seasons.

The mean annual rainfall ranges from 650mm in the southwest corner of the state to 1000mm in the eastern and southeastern parts of the state. Primarily a summer phenomenon, the Bay of Bengal branch of the Indian monsoon is the major bearer of rain in most parts of state. It is the south-west monsoon which brings most of the rain here, although rain due to the western disturbances and north-east monsoon also contribute small quantities towards the overall precipitation of the state.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after being}} {{declared}} a hurricane, the eye started {{to appear on}} visible satellite imagery. With low wind shear and warm waters, further intensification was anticipated. Very cold cloud tops <b>with</b> <b>temperatures</b> as low as –112°F (–80°C) surrounded the developing eye allowing the storm to intensify. Strengthening stopped for most of July19 and {{the first half of}} July20. That day, Fausto strengthened slightly as a ragged eye formed while the storm passed between the islands of Clarion and Socorro. At this time, the hurricane reached its peak intensity with winds of 90mph (150km/h) and a minimum pressure of 977mbar (hPa; 28.85inHg). Operationally, Fausto was assessed to have reached its peak intensity several hours later as a minimal Category 2 hurricane with winds of 100mph (155km/h) as the eye became better defined. However, the storm was located over 75°F (24°C) waters, causing it to gradually weaken along with diminishing convective activity. Later that day, Fausto was downgraded to a tropical storm and further weakened to a tropical depression the next day. With little or no remaining convection, the system degenerated into a remnant low pressure area as it traveled towards the west-northwest. The remnants of Fausto dissipated on July24, while located about 1,065mi (1,715km) west of Cabo San Lucas.|$|E

5|$|The local {{interstellar}} medium is {{a region of}} space within 100parsecs (pc) of the Sun, which is of interest both for its proximity and for its interaction with the Solar System. This volume nearly coincides with a region of space known as the Local Bubble, which {{is characterized by a}} lack of dense, cold clouds. It forms a cavity in the Orion Arm of the Milky Way galaxy, with dense molecular clouds lying along the borders, such as those in the constellations of Ophiuchus and Taurus. (The actual distance to the border of this cavity varies from 60 to 250pc or more.)

30|$|Equation (5) {{shows that}} the ideality factor is {{inversely}} proportional to the temperature. The ideality factor significantly decreases <b>with</b> <b>temperature</b> only at low temperature and changes slowly when the temperature is over 300 [*]K [28, 29]. However, as shown in Table  1, the reverse saturation current increases significantly <b>with</b> the <b>temperature</b> which {{is different from the}} ideality factor. It can be explained by Eq. (2). According to Eq. (2), the reverse saturation current increases <b>with</b> <b>temperature</b> because T 2 and exp (−[*]qΦB/kT) increase <b>with</b> <b>temperature.</b> Due to the exponential relationship between exp (−[*]qΦB/kT) and −[*]qΦB/kT, exp (−[*]qΦB/kT) increases significantly <b>with</b> <b>temperature.</b> Based on the research by Zhu et al [30], qΦB of the Au/Si contact in the experiment at 273 [*]K and 295 [*]K are 0.77 [*]eV and 0.79 [*]eV, respectively. The calculated results show that the reverse saturation current at 295 [*]K is six times as much as the reverse saturation current at 273 [*]K, explaining why the reverse saturation current increases significantly <b>with</b> <b>temperature.</b>|$|R
