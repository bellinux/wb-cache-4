On one side it has been confidently urged as a sure symptom of a decaying trade: on the other side it has been insisted that it is a circumstance attendant upon a thriving trade; for that the greater is the <b>whole</b> <b>quantity</b> of trade, the greater of course must be the positive number of failures, while the aggregate success is still in the same proportion.

We have already had very ample means of gathering that the year 1796 was a very favorable year of trade, and in that year the number of bankruptcies was at least one fifth below the usual average.

Real-time PCR was used to compare and analyze the expression of TLR 4 both in different tissues and growing periods of piglets which aimed at discussing the function of TLR 4 in immune responses in the piglets of development periods as well as showing the relationship between the expression level and piglets sensitivity to different subtypes E. coli.

40|$|Most {{recent studies}} on the {{long-term}} supply of uranium make simplistic assumptions on the available resources and their production costs. Some consider the <b>whole</b> uranium <b>quantities</b> in the Earth's crust and then estimate the production costs based on the ore grade only, disregarding the size of ore bodies and the mining techniques. Other studies consider the resources reported by countries for a given cost category, disregarding undiscovered or unreported quantities. In both cases, the resource estimations are sorted following a cost merit order. In this paper, we describe a methodology based on “geological environments”. It provides a more detailed resource estimation and it is more flexible regarding cost modelling. The global uranium resource estimation introduced in this paper results from the sum of independent resource estimations from different geological environments. A geological environment is defined by its own geographical boundaries, resource dispersion (average grade and size of ore bodies and their variance), and cost function. With this definition, uranium resources are considered within ore bodies. The deposit breakdown of resources is modelled using a bivariate statistical approach where size and grade are the two random variables. This makes resource estimates possible for individual projects. Adding up all geological environments provides a repartition of all Earth's crust resources in which ore bodies are sorted by size and grade. This subset-based estimation is convenient to model specific cost structures...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This article aims {{to provide}} an {{interpretation}} of the structure and spatial patterning of the non-ceramic refuse from the Neolithic site of Bylany. The data are considered at three levels: tackling questions of refuse management and deposition in the vicinity of houses; the spatial distribution of refuse within the settlement area as a whole; and the quantity and structure of non-ceramic refuse from a long-term settlement perspective. The analysed assemblage of non-ceramic finds is divided into five categories: chipped stone, polished stone, whetstones, manos/metates, and other stones without use-wear traces. The analysis is based on GIS and multivariate statistics. The spatial distribution and quantity of refuse are analysed with respect to space (in terms of prox-imity to Neolithic houses and the whole of the excavated settlement area) and time (the duration of settlement in six chronological stages). No deliberate pattern of refuse management was identi-fied {{in the vicinity of the}} houses, but the refuse was found to have a tendency towards peripheral grouping within the settled area as a <b>whole.</b> Refuse <b>quantity</b> depends on the number of houses and settlement duration. The negative correlation between the mean density of non-ceramic arte-facts per house and the number of houses in corresponding chronological stages may be explained by the interpretation that refuse was commonly deposited within abandoned houses, which would be consistent with ethnoarchaeological observations...|$|R
60|$|The second {{benefit to}} be {{expected}} from giving to women the free use of their faculties, by leaving them the free choice of their employments, and opening to them the same field of occupation and the same prizes and encouragements as to other human beings, would be that of doubling the mass of mental faculties available for the higher service of humanity. Where there is now one person qualified to benefit mankind and promote the general improvement, as a public teacher, or an administrator of some branch of public or social affairs, there would then be a chance of two. Mental superiority of any kind is at present everywhere so much below the demand; {{there is such a}} deficiency of persons competent to do excellently anything which it requires any considerable amount of ability to do; that the loss to the world, by refusing to make use of one-half of the <b>whole</b> <b>quantity</b> of talent it possesses, is extremely serious.

Much of it is employed, and would in any case be employed, in domestic management, and in the few other occupations open to women; and from the remainder indirect benefit is in many individual cases obtained, through the personal influence of individual women over individual men. But these benefits are partial; their range is extremely circumscribed; and if they must be admitted, on the one hand, as a deduction from the amount of fresh social power that would be acquired by giving freedom to one-half of the whole sum of human intellect, there must be added, on the other, the benefit of the stimulus that would be given to the intellect of men by the competition; or (to use a more true expression) by the necessity that would be imposed on them of deserving precedency before they could expect to obtain it.|$|E
60|$|At {{the end of}} March {{the opium}} jars arrive at the stores by water and by land, and {{continue}} accumulating for some weeks. Every jar is labelled and stowed in a proper place, separately tested with extreme accuracy, and valued. When the <b>whole</b> <b>quantity</b> has been received, the contents of all the jars are thrown into great vats, occupying a very large building, whence the mass is distributed, to be made up into balls for the markets. This operation is carried on in a long paved room, where every man is ticketed, and many overseers are stationed {{to see that the}} work is properly conducted. Each workman sits on a stool, with a double stage and a tray before him. On the top stage is a tin basin, containing opium sufficient for three balls; in the lower another basin, holding water: in the tray stands a brass hemispherical cup, in which the ball is worked. To the man's right hand is another tray, with two compartments, one containing thin pancakes of poppy petals pressed together, the other a cupful of sticky opium-water, made from refuse opium. The man takes the brass cup, and places a pancake at the bottom, smears it with opium-water, and with many plies of the pancakes makes a coat for the opium. Of this he takes about one-third of the mass before him, puts it inside the petals, and agglutinates many other coats over it: the balls are then again weighed, and reduced or increased to a certain weight if necessary. At the day's end, each man takes his work to a rack with numbered compartments, and deposits it in that which answers to his own number, thence the balls (each being put in a clay cup) are carried to an enormous drying-room, where they are exposed in tiers, and constantly examined and turned, to prevent their being attacked by weevils, which are very prevalent during moist winds, little boys creeping along the racks all day long for this purpose. When dry, the balls are packed in two layers of six each in chests, with the stalks, dried leaves, and capsules of the plant, and sent down to Calcutta. A little opium is prepared of very fine quality for the Government Hospitals, and some for general sale in India; but the proportion is trifling, and such is made up into square cakes. A good workman will prepare from thirty to fifty balls a day, the total produce being 10,000 to 12,000 a day; during one working season 1,353,000 balls are manufactured for the Chinese market alone.|$|E
60|$|Having {{spoken of}} Lakes I must not omit to mention, as a kindred {{feature of this}} country, those bodies of still water called TARNS. In the economy of Nature these are useful, as auxiliars to Lakes; for if the <b>whole</b> <b>quantity</b> of water which falls upon the {{mountains}} in time of storm were poured down upon the plains without intervention, in some quarters, of such receptacles, the habitable grounds {{would be much more}} subject than they are to inundation. But, as some of the collateral brooks spend their fury, finding a free course toward and also down the channel of the main stream of the vale before those that have to pass through the higher tarns and lakes have filled their several basins, a gradual distribution is effected; and the waters thus reserved, instead of uniting, to spread ravage and deformity, with those which meet with no such detention, contribute to support, for a length of time, the vigour of many streams without a fresh fall of rain. Tarns are found in some of the vales, and are numerous upon the mountains. A Tarn, in a Vale, implies, for the most part, that the bed of the vale is not happily formed; that the water of the brooks can neither wholly escape, nor diffuse itself over a large area. Accordingly, in such situations, Tarns are often surrounded by an unsightly tract of boggy ground; but this is not always the case, and in the cultivated parts of the country, when the shores of the Tarn are determined, it differs only from the Lake in being smaller, and in belonging mostly to a smaller valley, or circular recess. Of this class of miniature lakes, Loughrigg Tarn, near Grasmere, is the most beautiful example. It has a margin of green firm meadows, of rocks, and rocky woods, a few reeds here, a little company of water-lilies there, with beds of gravel or stone beyond; a tiny stream issuing neither briskly nor sluggishly out of it; but its feeding rills, from the shortness of their course, so small as to be scarcely visible. Five or six cottages are reflected in its peaceful bosom; rocky and barren steeps rise up above the hanging enclosures; and the solemn Pikes of Langdale overlook, from a distance, the low cultivated ridge of land that forms the northern boundary of this small, quiet, and fertile domain. The mountain Tarns can only be recommended to the notice of the inquisitive traveller who has time to spare. They are difficult of access and naked; yet some of them are, in their permanent forms, very grand; and there are accidents of things which would make the meanest of them interesting. At all events, one of these pools is an acceptable sight to the mountain wanderer; not merely as an incident that diversifies the prospect, but as forming in his mind a centre or conspicuous point to which objects, otherwise disconnected or insubordinated, may be referred. Some few have a varied outline, with bold heath-clad promontories; and, as they mostly lie {{at the foot of a}} steep precipice, the water, where the sun is not shining upon it, appears black and sullen; and, round the margin, huge stones and masses of rock are scattered; some defying conjecture as to the means by which they came thither; and others obviously fallen from on high--the contribution of ages! A not unpleasing sadness is induced by this perplexity, and these images of decay; while the prospect of a body of pure water unattended with groves and other cheerful rural images, by which fresh water is usually accompanied, and unable to give furtherance to the meagre vegetation around it--excites a sense of some repulsive power strongly put forth, and thus deepens the melancholy natural to such scenes. Nor is the feeling of solitude often more forcibly or more solemnly impressed than by the side of one of these mountain pools: though desolate and forbidding, it seems a distinct place to repair to; yet where the visitants must be rare, and there can be no disturbance. Water-fowl flock hither; and the lonely angler may here be seen; but the imagination, not content with this scanty allowance of society, is tempted to attribute a voluntary power to every change which takes place in such a spot, whether it be the breeze that wanders over the surface of the water, or the splendid lights of evening resting upon it in the midst of awful precipices.|$|E

These implantable agglomerates were produced by either low or high shear granulation. Unloaded Mi-Pro pellets presented higher sphericity and mechanical properties, but were slightly less porous than Kenwood granules (57. 7 % vs 61. 2 %). Nevertheless, the <b>whole</b> expected <b>quantity</b> of ibuprofen could be integrated into both types of granules. A combination of surface analysis, using near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy coupling chemical imaging, and pellet porosity, by mercury intrusion measurements, allowed ibuprofen to be located. It was shown that, from 0 % to 22 % drug content, ibuprofen deposited simultaneously on the granule surface, as evidenced by the increase in surface NIR signal, and inside the pores, as highlighted by the decrease in pore volume. From 22 %, porosity was almost filled, and additional drug substance coated the granule surfaces, leading to a large increase in the surface NIR signal. This coating was more regular for Mi-Pro pellets owing to their higher sphericity and greater surface deposition of drug substance. Unit crush tests using a microindenter revealed that ibuprofen loading enhanced the mechanical strength of granules, especially above 22 % drug content, which was favorable to further application of the granules as a bone defect filler...|$|R

This disproportionate production of some things, which is overproduction in relation to the production of other things, is the only kind of overproduction that can take place on any considerable scale, and the overproduction of which we hear so much is evidently of this character.|$|E
40|$|Humans {{in space}} {{are exposed to}} {{elevated}} levels of radiation compared to ground. Different sources contribute to the total exposure with galactic cosmic rays being the most important component. The application of numerical and anthropomorphic phantoms in simulations allows the estimation of dose rates from galactic cosmic rays in individual organs and <b>whole</b> body <b>quantities</b> such as the effective dose. The male and female reference phantoms defined by the International Commission on Radiological Protection and the hermaphrodite numerical RANDO phantom are voxel implementations of anthropomorphic phantoms and contain all organs relevant for radiation risk assessment. These anthropomorphic phantoms together with a spherical water phantom were used in this work to translate the mean shielding of organs in the different anthropomorphic voxel phantoms into positions in the spherical phantom. This relation allows using a water sphere as surrogate for the anthropomorphic phantoms in both simulations and measurements. Moreover, using spherical phantoms in the calculation of radiation exposure offers great advantages over anthropomorphic phantoms in terms of computational time. In this work, the mean shielding of organs in the different voxel phantoms exposed to isotropic irradiation is presented {{as well as the}} corresponding depth in a water sphere. Dose rates for Low-Earth orbit from galactic cosmic rays during solar minimum conditions were calculated using the different phantoms and are compared to the results for a spherical water phantom in combination with the mean organ shielding. For the spherical water phantom the impact of different aluminium shielding between 1 g/cm² and 100 g/cm² was calculated. The dose equivalent rates were used to estimate the effective dose rate...|$|R
40|$|In {{philosophy}} of language, the phenomena fundamental to human communication are routinely modeled {{in ways that}} do not require commitment to a concept of “information ” separate from those of “data, ” “meaning,” “communication, ” “knowledge, ” and “relevance ” (inter alia). A taxonomy of conceptions of information may be developed that relies on commonly drawn philosophical distinctions (between linguistic, mental, and physical entities, between objects and events, and between particulars and universals); in such a taxonomy, no category requires the label “information” in order to be differentiated from others. It is suggested that a conception of information-as-relevance is currently the most productive of advances in theoretical information studies. Unsurprisingly, the nature of information has long been a topic of central concern for scholars of information studies (IS). 1 The body of literature in which authors have attempted to provide answers to the question “What is information? ” may be viewed in any (or any combination) of the following ways: (i) as contributing to science—if information is cast as a naturally occurring phenomenon; (ii) as contributing to social science—if information {{is considered to be a}} product of human artifice; or (iii) as contributing to philosophy—if “information ” is treated primarily as a fundamental concept existing at the same level as, for example, meaning, knowledge, and truth. Although this body of literature is sizeable when taken as a <b>whole,</b> the <b>quantity</b> of work that may be classed under the third heading is small. One approach that is often taken in studies representative of the third class is to compare theories of information with theories of knowledge. Commonly...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} it is proved {{by using the}} Clifford algebra {{formalism}} that the standard transformations (ST) of the three-dimensional (3 D) vectors of the electric and magnetic fields E and B are not the Lorentz transformations (LT) of well-defined quantities from the 4 D spacetime. This difference between the ST and the LT is obtained regardless of the used algebraic objects (1 -vectors or bivectors) for {{the representation of the}} electric and magnetic fields in the usual observer dependent decompositions of F. The LT correctly transform the <b>whole</b> 4 D <b>quantity,</b> e. g., E_f=F·γ_ 0, whereas the ST are the result of the application of the LT only to the part of E_f, i. e., to F, but leaving gamma_ 0 unchanged. The new decompositions of F in terms of 4 D quantities that are defined without reference frames, i. e., the absolute quantities, are introduced and discussed. It is shown that the LT of the 4 D quantities representing electric and magnetic fields correctly describe the motional electromotive force (emf) for all relatively moving inertial observers, whereas it is not the case with the ST of the 3 D E and B.
