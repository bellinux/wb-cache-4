Moore would later guest star in the episodes [...] "Winter Madness", [...] "Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter", [...] "Emanuelle Goes to Dinosaur Land", and [...] "I Do Do". In an interview with USA Today in October 2009, Fey said that Jack would find more enduring love in the upcoming season. [...] "As <b>we</b> <b>move</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> back half of the season, we'd like to get [...] into a real adult relationship with some hurdles." [...] In the same interview, Baldwin noted, [...] "Fifty-year-old Jack running around still using women like a drug is not where I'd like him to end up." [...] Actor Larry Wilcox made a cameo in this episode, though, he was in character playing Officer Jon Baker from his old days in the drama show CHiPs, as Liz Lemon had a teen crush on Wilcox. In one scene of this episode, Liz says [...] "shark farts", and when asked about it in an April 2010 interview, Fey revealed that the term [...] "was one that we ad-libbed that we ended up leaving in. The studio asked us not to leave it in, but we left it in." ...|$|E

In a conversation with Spector during a lecture at the University of Texas, Smith voiced his opinions on the game's development: [...] "I feel like we f----- up the technology management of it, ...

Mrs. Bradfort's arms were still on the chariot, I observed, its owner refusing all Rupert's solicitations to supplant them by those of Hardinge.

The carved figure, Decebalus, was a Dacian king who took on the armies of Emperor Trajan and is regarded as a great Romanian folk hero. Dragan, more prosaically, is a rich businessman who paid for it to be carved. On this slightly ominous note of resurgent nationalism, we pass into the gorge itself.|$|E

[...] recently conducted a literature review for the UK Higher Education Academy which {{found that there was}} no empirical evidence of a single new generation of young students.

The nature of the metaphor itself is challenged, with White and Le Cornu (2011) drawing attention to the difficulties that a language-based analogy introduces, especially when then linked to age and place. They also highlight the rapid technological advances that have been made in the last ten years, most notably in the advent of social networking platforms. White and Le Cornu therefore propose an alternative metaphor of Visitors and Residents which they suggest more accurately represents the ways in which learners engage with technology in a social networking age.|$|E
