25|$|These {{tests are}} rough-and-ready tools which grammarians employ to reveal clues about {{syntactic}} structure. A <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>caution</b> is warranted when employing these tests, since they often deliver contradictory results. Some syntacticians even arrange the tests {{on a scale}} of reliability, with less-reliable tests treated as useful to confirm constituency though not sufficient on their own. Failing to pass a single test {{does not mean that the}} unit is not a constituent, and conversely, passing a single test does not mean necessarily that the unit is a constituent. It is best to apply as many tests as possible to a given unit in order to prove or to rule out its status as a constituent.|$|E
2500|$|... "One-to-one" [...] and [...] "onto" [...] are {{terms that}} were {{more common in the}} older English {{language}} literature; [...] "injective", [...] "surjective", and [...] "bijective" [...] were originally coined as French words {{in the second quarter of}} the 20th century by the Bourbaki group and imported into English. [...] As a <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>caution,</b> [...] "a one-to-one function" [...] is one that is injective, while a [...] "one-to-one correspondence" [...] refers to a bijective function. [...] Also, the statement [...] "f maps A onto B" [...] differs from [...] "f [...] maps A into B" [...] in that the former implies that f is an onto function (i.e., surjective), while the latter makes no assertion about the nature of the mapping. [...] In more complicated statements the one letter difference can easily be missed. [...] Due to the confusing nature of this older terminology, these terms have declined in popularity relative to the Bourbakian terms.|$|E

60|$|Nevertheless, {{he opened}} the little phial of {{medicine}} which Steele had given him and swallowed two of the pellets. That they were a powerful stimulant of the heart he knew, but that an overdose would kill he only suspected from Steele's <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>caution.</b>|$|E
60|$|My <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>caution</b> were unnecessary, for {{no sooner}} had the bull turned in our {{direction}} than the officer let go his hold upon me and fled into a doorway near at hand.|$|R
60|$|I {{was near}} to {{laughing}} at these <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>caution,</b> thinking how completely {{the tables were}} turned between us, when it was him who seemingly had grown timorous, and I showed myself the venturesome one.|$|R

60|$|George {{was not as}} much at his ease as {{he might}} have been, for he had not grown {{familiar}} with the explosive, as the others had, and he uttered many a <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>caution</b> {{when they came to}} those portions of the woods where the trees stood more thickly together.|$|E
60|$|Having spoken her <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>caution,</b> Mrs. Macallan made {{no further}} advance to me. I dare {{say she was}} right. Still, it seemed hard to be left, without a word of advice or of sympathy, to decide for myself what it was my duty to my husband to do next.|$|E
6000|$|On {{the next}} morning Peregrine saw his {{grandfather}} before breakfast. His mother came to his room door while he was dressing to whisper a <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>caution</b> to him.

60|$|Josiah Cotton {{had heard}} Captain Putnam's <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>caution</b> to Aaron Fairchild, {{and as he}} had a great regard for persons who were rich, {{and did not want to}} get himself into trouble, he {{resolved}} to move with caution.|$|R
50|$|It {{is likely}} the {{practice}} <b>of</b> using police <b>cautions</b> began {{early in the}} nineteenth century. In the 1920s written warnings started being given for motoring offences. In 1928 the Home Office published statistics on cautions, and by 1931 was giving advice on the <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> <b>cautions.</b>|$|R
60|$|And now a <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>caution.</b> Our adversaries {{think they}} can gain a point if they could force me to openly deny the charge, by which some degree of offence would {{be given to the}} Americans.

6000|$|... "Certainly I do. At {{the police}} court proceedings, we shall {{hear the case}} for the prosecution, but in all {{probability}} his solicitors will advise him to reserve his defence.

60|$|After a long morning's sitting {{the girls}} had started forth with Harz and Dawney to spend the {{afternoon}} at the ruin; Miss Naylor, kept at home by headache, watched them depart with <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>caution</b> against sunstroke, stinging nettles, and strange dogs.|$|R
60|$|His mother {{turned to}} him now, and her <b>words</b> were <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>caution,</b> prayers that he should {{adventure}} on naught so vast and appalling to her woman's mind, without due thought and argument in council.

60|$|The {{weight of}} the wind {{increased}} as the night advanced, and by the <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>caution</b> which the sailors uttered from time to time, the boys knew that those who should best understand such matters were anxious regarding {{the outcome of this}} night run.|$|R
60|$|She obeyed mechanically, {{and they}} fared {{on through the}} thick ferns in this fashion for some moments, he looking ahead, {{occasionally}} dropping a <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>caution</b> or encouragement, but never glancing at her face. When they reached the buggy he lifted her into it carefully,--and perpendicularly, it struck her afterwards, very much {{as if she had}} been a transplanted sapling with bared and sensitive roots,--and then gravely took his place beside her.|$|E
6000|$|And {{she knew}} that Frank was under Camilla's spell, and admired and trusted her still; nor had she been able to utter a <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>caution</b> to undeceive him. Should she have the power on the morrow? Camilla really loved skating, and {{surrounded}} as she was sure to be, there was hope of escaping her vigilant eye once more. To-morrow there would be another meeting with Frank! perhaps another walk with him! ...|$|E

Unless they gets married afore they're thirty, or thirty-five at most, they're most sure to get such ideas into their head as no one can mostly approve." [...] This had been {{intended}} by Matthew as a <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>caution</b> to his master, but had really the opposite effect. He resolved at the moment that the latter should not be said of Miss Thoroughbung.|$|E

50|$|Bonduca, {{the queen}} of the Iceni, gloats over the defeats {{suffered}} by the Romans at the hands of her forces. She predicts that the Romans will soon be crushed. Bonduca's confidence is challenged by her general Caratach, who tells her that the Romans are not easily crushed and that the war will be very different from the tribal conflicts they are familiar with. It will be either total victory or utter defeat. Bonduca accepts Caratach's <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>caution.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Many {{things of}} moment {{had to be}} done in the house that day before dinner. In the first place there was a long {{interview}} between the father and daughter. For a few minutes, perhaps, he was really happy when she was kneeling with her arms upon his knees, thanking him for what he had done, while tears of joy were streaming down her cheeks. He would not bring himself to say a <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>caution</b> to her. Would it not be to paint the snow white to caution her as to her conduct? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That young man, Mr. Inspector," [...] he said complainingly, [...] "puts {{altogether}} {{too much}} feeling into his work. I {{may have been}} a bit sarcastic with him once or twice; but if it comes to a lifelong vendetta, or anything of that sort, why, he's beginning to look for trouble--that's all! I'm getting sick of the sight of him. If ever I lunch or dine out he's there. If I go to a theater he's about. Whatever harmless amusement I go in for he's there looking on. Just give him a <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>caution,</b> Mr. Inspector. I'm a good-tempered man, but this can't go on forever." ...|$|E
60|$|He sat for {{ten minutes}} {{thinking}} what he had better do, finding the task thus imposed upon him {{to be much more}} difficult than the distribution of a loan. At last he determined that, if he did nothing, things would probably settle themselves. Mr. Houston, when he received no reply from his lady-love, would certainly be quiescent, and Gertrude, without any assent from her lover, could hardly arrange her journey to Ostend. Perhaps it might be well that he should say a <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>caution</b> to his wife; but as to that he did not at present quite make up his mind, as he was grievously disturbed while he was considering the subject.|$|E
