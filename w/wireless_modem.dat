5|$|Internet Connection Sharing, {{supported}} on compatible devices, allows {{the phone to}} share its Internet connection with computers via USB and Bluetooth. Windows Mobile supports virtual private networking over PPTP protocol. Most devices with mobile connectivity also have a Radio Interface Layer. The Radio Interface Layer provides the system interface between the Cell Core layer within the Windows Mobile OS and the radio protocol stack used by the <b>wireless</b> <b>modem</b> hardware. This allows OEMs to integrate a variety of modems into their equipment.|$|E
5|$|Snapdragon is a {{suite of}} {{system on a chip}} (SoC) {{semiconductor}} products designed and marketed by Qualcomm for mobile devices. The Snapdragon central processing unit (CPU) uses the ARM RISC instruction set, and a single SoC may include multiple CPU cores, a graphics processing unit (GPU), a <b>wireless</b> <b>modem,</b> and other software and hardware to support a smartphone's global positioning system (GPS), camera, gesture recognition and video. Snapdragon semiconductors are embedded in devices of various systems, including Android and Windows Phone devices. They are also used for netbooks, in cars, wearable devices and other devices.|$|E
5|$|Adoption of Snapdragon {{contributed to}} Qualcomm's {{transition}} from a <b>wireless</b> <b>modem</b> company to one that also produces {{a wider range of}} hardware and software for mobile devices. In July 2011 Qualcomm acquired certain assets from GestureTek in order to incorporate its gesture recognition intellectual property into Snapdragon SoCs. In mid-2012 Qualcomm announced the Snapdragon software development kit (SDK) for Android devices at the Uplinq developer conference. The SDK includes tools for facial recognition, gesture recognition, noise cancellation and audio recording. That November Qualcomm acquired some assets from EPOS Development in order to integrate its stylus and gesture recognition technology into Snapdragon products. It also collaborated with Microsoft to optimize Windows Phone 8 for Snapdragon semiconductors.|$|E
50|$|<b>Wireless</b> <b>modems</b> come in {{a variety}} of types, bandwidths, and speeds. <b>Wireless</b> <b>modems</b> are often {{referred}} to as transparent or smart. They transmit information that is modulated onto a carrier frequency to allow many simultaneous wireless communication links to work simultaneously on different frequencies.|$|R
5000|$|A further {{evolution}} is the 3.5G technology HSDPA, which provides speeds of multiple Megabits per second. Several of the mobile network operators that provide 3G or faster wireless internet access offer plans and <b>wireless</b> <b>modems</b> that enable computers {{to connect to}} and access the internet. These <b>wireless</b> <b>modems</b> are typically {{in the form of}} a small USB based device or a small, portable mobile hotspot that acts as a WiFi access point (hotspot) to enable multiple devices to connect to the internet. WiMAX based services that provide high speed wireless internet access are available in some countries and also rely on <b>wireless</b> <b>modems</b> that connect to the provider's wireless network. <b>Wireless</b> USB <b>Modems</b> are nicknamed as [...] "Dongles".|$|R

25|$|Research In Motion Limited {{was founded}} in March 1984 by Mike Lazaridis and Douglas Fregin. At the time, Lazaridis was an {{engineering}} student at the University of Waterloo while Fregin was an engineering student at the University of Windsor. In 1988, RIM became the first wireless data technology developer in North America and the first company outside Scandinavia to develop connectivity products for Mobitex wireless packet-switched data communications networks. In 1990, RIM introduced the DigiSync Film KeyKode Reader. In 1991, RIM introduced the first Mobitex protocol converter. In 1992, RIM introduced the first Mobitex point-of-sale solution, a protocol converter box that interfaced with existing point-of-sale terminal equipment to enable wireless communication. In 1993, RIM introduced the RIMGate, the first general purpose Mobitex X.25 gateway. In the same year, RIM launched Ericsson Mobidem AT and Intel <b>wireless</b> <b>modem</b> containing RIM modem firmware. In 1994, RIM introduced the first Mobitex mobile point-of-sale terminal. In the same year, RIM received the Emmy Award for Technical Innovation and the KPMG High Technology Award. In 1995, RIM introduced Freedom, the first Type II PCMCIA radio modem for Mobitex.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper has}} two main purposes. The {{first is to}} present a review of data {{communications}} concepts essential {{in the design of}} <b>wireless</b> <b>modems</b> for the ITS 220 MHz spectral allocations. The second is to propose an architecture for such modems which offers a spectral efficiency much higher than that available in current products. The new modem architecture is implemented using the combination of a digital signal processor, discrete electronics, and high level software. All sophisticated signal processing is implemented in software to provide both high performance and flexibility. The system forms an ideal testbed for the design of future enhancements and modifications to fit specific ITS applications. A prototype has been constructed and subjected to full bench testing. Preliminary field testing has been performed and more is in progress. Key words: mobile radio communications, <b>wireless</b> <b>modems,</b> fading channels, intelligent transportation systems.
