2500|$|Green roofs can be {{categorized}} as intensive, semi-intensive, or extensive, depending on the depth of planting medium {{and the amount of}} maintenance they need. Extensive green roofs traditionally support 10-25 pounds of vegetation per square foot (50–120kg/m2) while intensive roofs support 80-150 pounds of vegetation per square foot (390–730kg/m2). Traditional roof gardens, which require a reasonable depth of soil to grow large plants or conventional lawns, are considered intensive because they are labour-intensive, requiring irrigation, feeding, and other maintenance. [...] Intensive roofs are more park-like with easy access and may include anything from kitchen herbs to shrubs and small trees. [...] Extensive green roofs, by contrast, are designed to be virtually self-sustaining and should require only a minimum of maintenance, perhaps a once-yearly weeding or an application of slow-release fertiliser to boost growth. [...] Extensive roofs are usually only accessed for maintenance. [...] They can be established on a very thin layer of soil (most use specially formulated composts): even a thin layer of rockwool laid directly onto a watertight roof can support a planting of Sedum species and mosses. [...] Some green roof designs incorporate both intensive and extensive elements. To protect the roof, a <b>waterproofing</b> <b>membrane</b> is often used, which is manufactured to remain watertight in extreme conditions including constant dampness, ponding water, high and low alkaline conditions and exposure to plant roots, fungi and bacterial organisms.|$|E

50|$|A {{protected}} membrane roof is a roof where {{thermal insulation}} or another material is located above the <b>waterproofing</b> <b>membrane.</b> Modern green roofs are {{a type of}} protected membrane roof. This development has been {{made possible by the}} creation of <b>waterproofing</b> <b>membrane</b> materials that are tolerant of supporting a load and the creation of thermal insulation that is not easily damaged by water. Frequently, rigid panels made of extruded polystyrene are used in PMR construction. The chief benefit of PMR roof design is that the covering protects the <b>waterproofing</b> <b>membrane</b> from thermal shock, ultraviolet light and mechanical damage. One potential disadvantage of protected membrane roof construction is the need for structural strength to support the weight of ballast that prevents wind from moving rigid foam panels or the weight of plants and growth media for a green roof. However, when flat roofs are constructed in temperate climates, the need to support snow load makes additional structural strength a common consideration in any event.|$|E

Because {{the shape of the}} deformation of <b>waterproof</b> <b>membrane</b> bulge was similar to semi-ellipsoid, the curve length corresponding to the maximum central deflection was calculated by elliptic equation. According to the curve length, the deformation could be calculated under the different water pressure and membrane thickness. Comparing the deformation with the maximum elongation ratio, the water pressure and the thickness of <b>waterproof</b> <b>membrane</b> which ensure the safety could be calculated in theory. If the water pressure was known, the thickness of spray-membrane could be determined in the tunnel engineering...|$|R

50|$|Grass or turf roofs {{have been}} around since the Viking times if not far earlier and make for a {{decorative}} and durable roof covering. Green roofs have been made by depositing topsoil or other growth media on flat roofs and seeding them (or allowing them to self-seed as nature takes its course). Maintenance in the form of simple visible inspection and removal of larger rooting plants has allowed these roofs to be successful in that they provide an excellent covering and UV light barrier for the roof <b>waterproofing</b> <b>membrane.</b> With some systems, the manufacturer requires that a root barrier membrane be laid above the <b>waterproofing</b> <b>membrane.</b> If well planned and fitted, the mass of the soil or growth medium can provide a good heat buffer for the building - storing the heat of the sun and releasing it into the building at night and thus keeping inside temperatures more even.
