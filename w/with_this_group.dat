5|$|In 1993, a new {{band called}} Inveigh Catharsis formed in Des Moines, with Gray on bass, Brainard on guitar and Colsefni on drums. Jordison jammed {{occasionally}} <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>group.</b> Brainard eventually left to join Jordison and Jones in Modifidious, participating in demo recordings {{at the end}} of '93 and early in '94. During 1994 Modifidious sometimes played the same shows as Crahan's Heads on the Wall band. Gray formed a death metal band called Body Pit, soon becoming popular in the local scene. Modifidious stopped playing in the wake of death metal's increasing pull. Gray failed to get Jordison to join Body Pit, but soon after he recruited local guitar teacher Mick Thomson, the band broke up.|$|E
5|$|The North Group was {{occupied}} from the Terminal Classic {{through to the}} Postclassic. This group's structures were built using a different method {{from those in the}} Central Group, and were made out of compacted clay without stone construction or facing. The group occupies Terraces7 through 9, which follow the contours of the natural terracing present and show no evidence of significant artificial levelling. In combination with a noted absence of sculptured monuments, the different construction methods and ceramic assemblages associated <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>group</b> imply an occupation of the North Group by a new settlement community who arrived in the Late Classic period, most probably K'iche' Maya from the highlands.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of molecular phylogenetics, cladistic theory and phylogenetic methods in the 1990s {{resulted in a}} dismemberment of the Liliaceae and its subsequent redistribution across three lilioid orders (Liliales, Asparagales and Dioscoreales). Subsequent work has shown that two other more recently recognized orders, Petrosaviales and Pandanales also segregate <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>group,</b> resulting in the modern concept of five constituent orders within the lilioid monocot assemblage. This has resulted in treating monocots as three informal groups, alismatid, lilioid and commelinid monocots. The lilioids are paraphyletic {{in the sense that}} commelinids form a sister group to Asparagales.|$|E

Allowing arbitrarily large sequences gets arbitrarily close to entropy [...] - [...] just like arithmetic coding [...] - [...] but requires huge codes to do so, so is not as practical as arithmetic coding for this purpose.|$|R
5|$|Black {{tracks the}} history of the second kidnapper, finding that he was {{involved}} in a military medical group; Swan's name is also associated <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>group.</b> As Black is investigating, Watts approaches him, showing him a second photograph of Taylor, now looking sickly, beside the canister. Watts believes she has less than two days to live. Meanwhile, Hollis has discovered that Swan frequently called Art Bell's Coast to Coast AM radio show under a pseudonym to discuss conspiracy theories about Gulf War syndrome. Bell invites Black onto the show to speak to a listening Swan; the two realise that Black's wife was killed by a pathogen Swan was ordered to test on his troops during the Gulf War—an order which came from a group outside of the Army.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, Abbe {{returned}} to Japan for the Summer Olympics in Tokyo. While in his homeland, {{he met with}} Ueshiba, updated him {{on the progress of}} aikido in the UK, and asked him to send another instructor to the UK to continue teaching the art. In 1966, Ueshiba sent Kazuo (T. K.) Chiba to the UK to continue the work Abbe had begun. Henry O'Tani (2009) has stated that during Abbe's absence from the UK, a dismissed BJC senior executive and several senior instructors misappropriated his financial and organisational resources and set up their own BJC group. In 1969, Abbe {{returned to}} the UK, but was distraught by the situation <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>group</b> that he had not authorised. When he asked former colleagues to help him rebuild the organisation, they refused; he subsequently left the UK, never to return.|$|E

Mexican-American politics during this century have included several factors, namely abolishment of predjudices against Americans of Mexican ancestry, improvement of educational facilities and opportunities, eradication of <b>this</b> <b>group's</b> social apathy, and elimination of any other inequities which plagued <b>this</b> ethnic <b>group.</b> Progress in these fields was, Mexican-American leaders believed, precursory to direct governmental participation of Texans of Mexican descent - as voters and candidates - in local, state, and national elections.
