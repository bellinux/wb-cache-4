500|$|Each cell {{consisted}} of a <b>wooden</b> <b>dowel</b> with a bifilar winding of copper and zinc wires. [...] The dowels were helically grooved like a screw thread to locate the wires precisely in position. [...] This enabled the copper and zinc wires to be placed very {{close to each other}} without coming into electrical contact. [...] Insulated wires could not be used as this would interfere with the operation of the electrolyte. [...] Copper wires were inserted into the ends of the dowels to which the copper and zinc windings were soldered. [...] These end wires were either attached to, or formed into, hooks and eyes for attaching to other cells. [...] This arrangement is depicted in figure 2. [...] These attachments provided the electrical connections as well as the mechanical linkages.Lardner, pp.288-289Moritz, p.97Pulvermacher, p.2 ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Wooden</b> <b>dowels</b> {{have been}} used in {{manufacturing}} and woodworking for many centuries. One of the earliest documented uses of <b>wooden</b> <b>dowels</b> was in Japanese shrines in AD 690, which were constructed using only wood, <b>wooden</b> <b>dowels</b> and pegs, and interlocking joints. Around AD 1000, Leif Erikson sailed across the North Atlantic in a ship that was largely constructed of overlapping planks held together by <b>wooden</b> <b>dowels</b> and iron nails. The <b>wooden</b> <b>dowels</b> did not rust and thus were more reliable than iron for long expeditions.|$|R

40|$|This work {{presents}} experimental {{analyses for}} validating various strengthening techniques applied to historic timber floors using traditional and/or innovative materials (FRP, fibre reinforced polymer). The traditional method proposed here consists of placing reinforcing planks above the existing floor beams and fixing them with 'dry' connections {{by means of}} <b>wooden</b> <b>dowels.</b> As an innovative technique, strengthening with wet lay-up carbon FRP laminates (CFRP) applied at {{the underside of the}} beams is examined, both as unique strengthening for floor beams and in combination with the above-mentioned traditional method on the composite structure. Results on the characterisation of the connections between materials ('dry' <b>wooden</b> <b>dowels</b> and FRP bond behaviour) and flexural tests on simple and mechanically jointed beams with or without CFRP strengthening are discussed. The main execution phases of the strengthening technique, and their limits and advantages, are also described...|$|R

50|$|Sant Climent de Taüll had the {{earliest}} wooden altar-frontal, which was 1.36 m × 0.98 m in size. When it reached Barcelona {{it was covered}} with a coat of paint which was removed. An inscription on the center of the upper frame shows that in 1579 the altar-frontal was repainted. The wooden altar frontal is enclosed by a narrow wooden frame, which is held together at the four corners with <b>wooden</b> <b>dowels.</b> The figures were each carved separately, and then were attached {{to the back of the}} panel using <b>wooden</b> <b>dowels.</b> The four side divisions contain a blind arcade of three arches, where there are figures located directly underneath. The arches are formed from tall capitals, which are supported by slim colonnettes with torus molding, as well as a high base. The upper right corner is slightly damaged, though some of the original colour can be seen on the lower left corner of the antependium. The frame was painted green and yellow, and there are indications that the frame originally had some stucco ornament. The wooden altar frontal used to have four symbols of the evangelists that had filled the outside of the mandorla, but these have been lost.|$|R
