25|$|Early English {{common law}} had, in many instances, imposed {{liability}} {{on those who}} had caused harm regardless of <b>wrongful</b> <b>intent</b> or negligence. Trespass was considered a remedy for all tortious wrongs, and sometimes used as a synonym for torts generally. Over the centuries, however, judges focused more on the intent and negligence behind the actions than {{the nature of the}} actions themselves, leading to the development of negligence and nuisance and the further development of trespass. At the time of Rylands, the previous case relied upon was Vaughan v Menlove, decided in the Court of Common Pleas in 1837. The case had almost identical facts to Rylands, but strict liability was never even considered. The case is instead thought of {{as one of the best}} attempts of early 19th Century English judges to build up the law of negligence. The outcome of Rylands meant that judges would again impose strict liability on defendants who accumulated dangerous things on their land without any need to prove negligence or <b>wrongful</b> <b>intent.</b> The decision won support for bringing the law relating to private reservoirs up to standard with the law relating to public reservoirs, which contained similar statutory provisions thanks to a pair of private Acts of Parliament passed in 1853 and 1864.|$|E

40|$|The {{action taken}} in Bush v. Gore by the five {{conservative}} Justices on the United States Supreme Court, Bugliosi argued, {{was not just}} wrong {{as a matter of}} law, but criminal: It was a malem in se, fully intended, premeditated theft of a national election for the Presidency of the United States. Now, as Balkan and Levinson would argue, this seventh, 2 ̆ 2 prosecutorial 2 ̆ 2 response [...] that the Court 2 ̆ 7 s action was not just wrong but criminal [...] is also not available to a devotee of either radical or moderate indeterminacy. Even assuming both criminal intent and severe harm-a <b>wrongful,</b> specific <b>intent</b> to thwart the democratic outcome and a profound harm to democracy-an element of the crime, namely the act, which in this case has to be misstating the law, cannot be borne out. The indeterminacy thesis, if true, logically precludes the moral or legal condemnation of a certain sort of criminality and venality [...] that of the official who intentionally and with harmful consequences violates an oath to uphold the law. If the indeterminacy thesis is correct, then there is no demonstrable violation of an oath to uphold the law merely because conclusion X does not follow from premises A and B, and there is no sense in trying to show one. More broadly, there is no sense, given indeterminacy, to holding this particular act of power (either Bush v. Gore itself or any other judicial construction or misconstruction of law) to the light of reason-at least, if by the light of reason we mean the light of legal reason. One can hold up power to the light of power, but nothing much follows morally from doing so, although quite a bit may follow politically, as Stanley Fish has never tired of reminding us...|$|R

40|$|This Article {{argues that}} a {{prosecutor}} 2 ̆ 7 s intent is always relevant to the courts 2 ̆ 7 analysis of misconduct, and that the courts should always consider a prosecutor 2 ̆ 7 s intent in determining whether a rule was violated and whether the verdict was prejudiced. Part II of this Article examines {{the use of the}} objective test to analyze a prosecutor 2 ̆ 7 s trial conduct. Part II offers several reasons courts give for avoiding inquiry into a prosecutor 2 ̆ 7 s mental culpability, analyzes those reasons, and concludes that although the application of an objective test is sufficient to correct misconduct in some instances, it does not foreclose application of a subjective test as well. Part III discusses the use by some courts [...] although infrequently and inconsistently applied [...] of a subjective test to review a prosecutor 2 ̆ 7 s conduct, and analyzes the reasons that the subjective test is appropriate in all cases. Part IV attempts to rationalize the courts 2 ̆ 7 use of a subjective test of a prosecutor 2 ̆ 7 s conduct.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{reasonableness}} is the golden thread which {{runs through the}} law of negligence, tying together all the disparate elements of duty, right, harm and injury into one coherent whole. It is the principle upon which the legal duty not to harm one's neighbour is based {{and it is the}} principle that ties that legal idea to particular fact situations. It is offundamental import to the law. A claim for damages based on negligence is a claim to be compensated for an injury caused unintentionally, and consequently the law must find some other justification for holding a person liable than that person's <b>wrongful</b> <b>intent</b> (which is the justification for intentional wrongs). That justification emerges from the concept of reasonableness. If a person injure...|$|E
40|$|Fraud claims {{filed by}} {{investors in the}} wake of the {{financial}} crisis of 2008 reveal a significant and unrecognized problem in securities law: the law treats claims of investors who purchase securities through private placements more favorably than it treats claims of investors who purchase shares on public exchanges or in public offerings. The disparity is a symptom of financial markets outpacing their legal and regulatory framework, and this Article proposes a remedy. The different hurdles confronting investors who invest in different transactions but who make similar allegations and rely on the same law are, the Article contends, an unfair and apparently unintended result of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (2 ̆ 2 PSLRA 2 ̆ 2) which sought to curb frivolous shareholder class actions. The PSLRA raised the standard plaintiffs must meet in alleging that a defendant had <b>wrongful</b> <b>intent,</b> or scienter, but it did not raise the standard applicable to claims that a plaintiff reasonably relied on an allegedly fraudulent misrepresentation or omission. Because establishing scienter is difficult for investors with access only to regulatory disclosures by publicly traded companies, while establishing reasonable reliance is more likely to be difficult for putatively sophisticated investors in private placements, investors in publicly accessible transactions face a higher hurdle than private placement investors when alleging fraud. This Article describes and critiques this effect of the PSLRA, and calls on Congress to revise standards so that investors victimized by fraud have the same chance of recovery through litigation whether or not they purchased securities in a private placement...|$|E
