5|$|Additionally, John Maynard Smith, a noted {{biologist}} with {{a strong}} background in aeronautics, {{has pointed out that}} bumblebees would not be expected to sustain flight, as they would need to generate too much power given their tiny <b>wing</b> <b>area.</b> However, in aerodynamics experiments with other insects, he found that viscosity at the scale of small insects meant even their small wings can move a very large volume of air relative to their size, and this reduces the power required to sustain flight by an order of magnitude.|$|E
5|$|It {{is still}} {{possible}} to lose all three hydraulic systems if serious damage occurs elsewhere, as nearly happened to a cargo airliner in 2002 during takeoff when a main gear tire exploded in the wheel well area. The damage in the left <b>wing</b> <b>area</b> caused total fluid loss from the number 1 and the number 2 hydraulic systems. The number 3 system was dented but not penetrated. DC-10s still have no fuse protection {{for any of the}} three hydraulic systems {{in the event of an}} exploding main gear tire.|$|E
5|$|Another {{solution}} to the high-speed problem is the delta wing. The delta wing had {{many of the same}} advantages of the swept wing in terms of transonic and supersonic performance, but offered much more internal room and overall surface area. This provided more room for fuel, an important consideration given the inefficient early jet engines of the era, and the large <b>wing</b> <b>area</b> provided ample lift at high altitudes. The delta wing also enabled slower landings than swept wings in certain conditions. The disadvantages of the design were increased drag at lower speeds and altitudes, and especially higher drag while maneuvering. For the interceptor role these were minor concerns, as the aircraft would be spending most of its time flying in straight lines at high altitudes and speeds, mitigating these disadvantages.|$|E
50|$|The medial fascia of the {{forewings}} is brown, {{except for}} the costa and other <b>wing</b> <b>areas</b> which are mostly yellow.|$|R
50|$|The basal fascia of the {{forewings}} is white, {{while the}} other <b>wing</b> <b>areas</b> are brown. The hindwings are brown with a white subterminal line.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} wings offered {{with the}} basic carriage were the La Mouette Ipsos series, in <b>wing</b> <b>areas</b> of 12, 14, 16 and 16.9 square metres.|$|R
5|$|The {{level of}} wing sweep, {{the angle of}} the wings in {{relation}} to the fuselage, can be altered in flight at the pilot's control. The variable wing can adopt any sweep angle between 25 degrees and 67 degrees, with a corresponding speed range for each angle; some Tornado ADVs were outfitted with an automatic wing-sweep system to reduce pilot workload. When the wings are swept back, the exposed <b>wing</b> <b>area</b> is lowered and drag is significantly decreased, which is conducive to performing high-speed low-level flight. The weapons pylons pivot with {{the angle of the}} variable-sweep wings so that the stores point in the direction of flight and do not hinder any wing positions.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} {{designed}} {{with a new}} methodology called fault tree analysis, which allowed {{the effects of a}} failure of a single part to be studied to determine its impact on other systems. To address concerns about safety and flyability, the 747's design included structural redundancy, redundant hydraulic systems, quadruple main landing gear and dual control surfaces. Additionally, some of the most advanced high-lift devices used in the industry were included in the new design, to allow it to operate from existing airports. These included slats running almost {{the entire length of the}} wing, as well as complex three-part slotted flaps along the trailing edge of the wing. The wing's complex three-part flaps increase <b>wing</b> <b>area</b> by 21 percent and lift by 90 percent when fully deployed compared to their non-deployed configuration.|$|E
5|$|The wing profile {{remained}} {{the same as the}} F-5E, but had modified leading edge extensions (LEX), which improved the maximum lift coefficient of the wing by about 12% with an increase in <b>wing</b> <b>area</b> of only 1.6%. The original aircraft was fairly sluggish in pitch, so the horizontal stabilizer was increased in size by 30% and a new dual-channel fly-by-wire control system was added. Destabilizing the aircraft in pitch and modifying the LEX improved the instantaneous turn rate by 7% to 20°/sec. Sustained turn rate at Mach0.8 and 15,000ft (4,572m) rose to 11.5°/sec, which compared well with the F-16's 12.8°/sec. Supersonic turn rates were 47% higher than those of the F-5E.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{restricted}} {{to the question of}} attainable speed limits and attacks the problem from different angles.

5|$|Apart {{from its}} greater size, the common raven differs from its cousins, the crows, {{by having a}} larger and heavier black beak, shaggy {{feathers}} around the throat and above the beak, and a wedge-shaped tail. Flying ravens are distinguished from crows by their tail shape, larger <b>wing</b> <b>area,</b> and more stable soaring style, which generally involves less wing flapping. Despite their bulk, ravens are easily as agile in flight as their smaller cousins. In flight the feathers produce a creaking sound that has been likened to the rustle of silk. The voice of ravens is also quite distinct, its usual call being a deep croak of a much more sonorous quality than a crow's call. In North America, the Chihuahuan raven (C. cryptoleucus) is fairly similar to the relatively small common ravens of the American southwest and is best distinguished by the still relatively smaller size of its bill, beard and body and relatively longer tail. All-black carrion crow (C. corone) in Europe may suggest a raven due to their largish bill but are still distinctly smaller and have the wing and tail shapes typical of crows.|$|E
5|$|To {{adapt the}} {{original}} Su-27 for naval operations, Sukhoi first incorporated a reinforced structure and undercarriage {{to withstand the}} great stress experienced upon landing, particularly quick descents and non-flare landings (landings where the aircraft does not 'float' and slow its decent rate just prior to touchdown). The leading edge slats, flaperons and other control surfaces are enlarged to provide increased lift and manoeuvrability at low speeds, although the wingspan remains unchanged. The wings feature double-slotted flaps and outboard drooping ailerons; in total, the refinements enlarge the <b>wing</b> <b>area</b> by 10–12%. The wings and stabilators are modified for folding to maximise the number of aircraft the carrier can accommodate and to allow ease of movement on deck. The aircraft is outfitted with more powerful turbofan engines to increase thrust-to-weight ratio, {{as well as an}} in-flight refuelling probe. The Su-33 sports canards that shorten the take-off distance and improve manoeuvrability, but have required reshaping of the leading edge root extensions (LERX). The rear radome is shortened and reshaped to prevent its striking the deck during high-Alpha (angle of attack) landings.|$|E
5|$|It soars high while {{searching for}} food, holding its wings {{horizontally}} when gliding. It flaps in short bursts which {{are followed by}} short periods of gliding. Its flight is less efficient than that of other vultures, as the wings are not as long, forming a smaller <b>wing</b> <b>area.</b> In comparison with the turkey vulture, the black vulture flaps its wings more frequently during flight. It is known to regurgitate when approached or disturbed, which assists in predator deterrence and taking flight by decreasing its takeoff weight. Like all New World vultures, the black vulture often defecates on its own legs, using the evaporation {{of the water in}} the feces and/or urine to cool itself, a process known as urohidrosis. It cools the blood vessels in the unfeathered tarsi and feet, and causes white uric acid to streak the legs. Because it lacks a syrinx, the black vulture, like other New World vultures, has very few vocalization capabilities. It is generally silent, but can make hisses and grunts when agitated or while feeding. The black vulture is , and roosts in large groups. In areas where their ranges overlap, the black vulture will roost on the bare branches of dead trees alongside groups of turkey vultures. The black vulture generally forages in groups; a flock of black vultures can easily drive a rival turkey vulture, which is generally solitary while foraging, from a carcass.|$|E

5|$|Required {{to tender}} {{by the end}} of April 1947, work began on receipt of Specification B.35/46 at Avro, led by {{technical}} director Roy Chadwick and chief designer Stuart Davies; the type designation was Avro 698. It was obvious to the design team that conventional aircraft could not satisfy the specification; knowing little about high-speed flight and unable to glean much from the Royal Aircraft Establishment or the US, they investigated German Second World War swept wing research. The team estimated that an otherwise conventional aircraft, with a swept wing of 45°, would have doubled the weight requirement. Realising that swept wings increase longitudinal stability, the team deleted the tail (empennage) and the supporting fuselage, it thus became a swept-back flying wing with only a rudimentary forward fuselage and a fin (vertical stabilizer) at each wingtip. The estimated weight was now only 50% over the requirement; a delta shape resulted from reducing the wingspan and maintaining the <b>wing</b> <b>area</b> by filling in the space between the wingtips, which enabled the specification to be met. Though Alexander Lippisch is generally credited as the pioneer of the delta wing, Chadwick's team had followed its own logical design process. The initial design submission had four large turbojets stacked in pairs buried in the wing either side of the centreline. Outboard of the engines were two bomb-bays.|$|E

40|$|The wing-scale morphologies of the pierid {{butterflies}} Pieris rapae (small white) and Delias nigrina (common jezabel), and the heliconine Heliconius melpomene {{are compared}} {{and related to}} the wing-reflectance spectra. Light scattering at the wing scales determines the wing reflectance, but when the scales contain an absorbing pigment, reflectance is suppressed in the absorption wavelength range of the pigment. The reflectance of the white <b>wing</b> <b>areas</b> of P. rapae, where the scales are studded with beads, is considerably {{higher than that of}} the white <b>wing</b> <b>areas</b> of H. melpomene, which has scales lacking beads. The beads presumably cause the distinct matt-white colour of the wings of pierids and function to increase the reflectance amplitude. This will improve the visual discrimination between conspecific males and females. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{male and}} a female kestrel were trained to fly over a mirror in a corridor, with lead weights {{attached}} to the feet to increase weight in the range 0 - 0 - 6 N (0 - 61 g). Films taken at 200 frames s" 1 allowed three-dimensional analysis of the displacements of the head, tail and wingtips. A kinematic analysis, based on Fourier series, {{was made of the}} displacements in three perpendicular directions and of periodic changes of <b>wing</b> <b>areas</b> and tail areas. With increased mass, there was a decrease in flight speed, increase in wing beat frequency, increase in vertical wing beat amplitude, and an increase in the inclination of the tail. The shorter wing beat cycle under load was mainly due to a decreased upstroke duration, implying that the relative importance of the down-stroke was increased. The tail area {{and to a lesser extent}} the <b>wing</b> <b>areas</b> were enlarged during flights with the largest added weight...|$|R
