50|$|John Sims {{received}} his formal education at Hampden-Sydney. In 1809, he had acquired the 325-acre tract and mansion from his uncle Matthew's heirs. The following year, John Sims married Maria Wilson Clark. During their marriage, they resided at the Black <b>Walnut</b> <b>plantation</b> house. John and Maria Sims had four children: Mary Elizabeth, Phebe Ann, Mary Wilson, and William Howson. In 1815, their residence was valued at $2,000.00.|$|E
50|$|Sims {{also sold}} beef to the Confederate troops and slave laborers {{stationed}} at the garrison. Sims signed a pardon on August 2, 1865. Union troops continued to occupy the Black <b>Walnut</b> <b>Plantation</b> following {{the conclusion of the}} war, however, this did not halt commercial activity. On April 17, 1865, Sims sold 1,500 pounds of oats, one barrel of flour, and three and one-half barrels of corn.|$|E
50|$|The Black <b>Walnut</b> <b>Plantation</b> {{reached its}} heyday by {{the mid-nineteenth century}} under the careful {{management}} of John Sims. The plantation in 1850 was described as consisting of 1,000 acres of improved land and 1,200 acres of unimproved land. His prosperity also was illustrated by the significant increase in slaveholdings. Between 1820 and 1840, John Sims increased his slaveholdings from 77 slaves to 137 slaves. By 1850, his labor force included 150 slaves.|$|E

50|$|John Sims, 1803-1852. John Sims, David Sims son, {{was largely}} {{responsible}} for Black Walnut's success {{as one of the}} most prosperous farms in Halifax County. John Sims received his inheritance in 1803, which included the 1,500-acre tract of land and 29 slaves. John Sims acquired additional landholdings in the county throughout the 1800s, becoming one of the largest landowners in the area. Only three other landowners, William Logan, Richard Logan, and John Coleman, held more land by 1850. John Sims operated the Black <b>Walnut</b> <b>plantation</b> for the next five decades, until his death in 1852.|$|E
50|$|Matthew Sims, 1773-1790. The lands {{retained}} by Matthew Sims were established as his homestead, where {{he built his}} manor house. The main house, which dates to c. 1770s, probably stood as a 1-story or -story single-pile, four-room house with interior end chimneys. The earliest documented outbuilding associated with the Black <b>Walnut</b> <b>plantation</b> was constructed southeast of the main house and consisted of a -story, wood-frame building (Figure 9). This building terminates in a steeply pitched roof that is sheathed in standing-seam metal. The late-eighteenth-century structure {{was used as a}} schoolhouse; the building is still extent on the Black Walnut property.|$|E
5000|$|William Howson Sims {{managed the}} {{substantial}} Black <b>Walnut</b> <b>plantation</b> between 1852 {{until his death}} in 1890. William Howson was educated at Hampden-Sydney, and passed the bar. [...] "However, innovative farming techniques were more attractive to him than the practice of law, and his time was devoted to the running of his plantation". During his tenure, he acquired title to the additional portions of the Black Walnut tract, as well as purchasing other landholdings in Halifax County. William Howson also assisted his aunt, Phoebe Howson Clark Bailey, with the operation of her plantation, [...] "Oak Hill". According to correspondence on file in the Bailey Family Papers, Phoebe Bailey's nephew, W.H. Sims, would mount his horse and spent the night at her plantation to assist her with affairs.In 1844, prior to inheriting the Black Walnut property, William Howson brought his wife, Sallie J. Wilson, and their four children, Eliza Broadnax, Maria Clark, John, and William Bailey, to reside at the manor house. During the 1860s, both of his daughters were sent to Richmond to attend private school. John Sims attended Virginia Military Institute (VMI) in 1867, while William Bailey was educated at [...] "Creek Side". William S. later graduated from Episcopal High School in Alexandria, Virginia.|$|E

40|$|A basic {{knowledge}} of tree {{needs and the}} application of simple management principles are required to produce quality black walnut timber. Black walnut (Juglans nigra) is a high value timber species. The only way to maximize profit from black <b>walnut</b> <b>plantations</b> is by good timber management.

40|$|Eastern {{black walnut}} trees (Juglans nigra) produce high-value, {{hardwood}} products and distinctively flavored, edible nuts. The potential for producing two valuable {{products from the}} same tree has {{captured the imagination of}} tree planters for years. Both large and small black <b>walnut</b> <b>plantations</b> have been established with the intent to harvest huge nut crops from trees that will eventually produce veneer-quality logs. However, if experience has taught us anything about black walnut, it is that optimum nut production and optimum wood production are not normally produced by the same tree...|$|R
5000|$|The Black <b>Walnut</b> <b>plantation</b> complex grew to {{encompass}} {{a variety of}} domestic and agricultural outbuildings; the main house served as the focal point. Domestic outbuildings, including a smokehouse, dairy, kitchen, and icehouse, were placed in a U-shaped cluster to the rear, or west, of the main house. Slave quarters and agricultural outbuildings were more isolated from the main living area. A formal boxwood garden was laid out south of the main house, and a terraced vegetable garden was situated to the northwest. A variety of native and {{ornamental trees and shrubs}} landscaped the grounds, and the entire complex was enclosed by woodland. A family cemetery was situated northwest of the house. John Sims' prosperity was illustrated by the substantial modifications made to the manor house during {{the first quarter of the}} nineteenth century, at which time the central section of the house was raised to a full two-story height. The house was altered again with the construction of a substantial two-story frame addition connected by a central hyphen, resulting in its present H-shaped configuration. The 1848 tax assessment for this property shows an increase in valuation due to [...] "improvements". The plan of the house consisted of two center-hall, single-pile units joined by a center hyphen. The exterior walls were sheathed in beaded wood siding. The building's massing terminated in a gable roof sheathed in metal standing-seam panels. Wooden block modillions ornamented the front and rear eaves and partially returned cornices. Central brick exterior-end chimneys were located on each gable-end. Small attic vents punctuated the gable ends. The three-bay main facade was characterized by its symmetrical composition. A one-story hipped roof portico was centered on the facade and delineated the front entrance. Nine-over-nine-light, double-hung, wooden sash windows were aligned across this facade. The window openings were framed by louvered wood blinds. One-room units flanked the rear two-story section, and a one-story porch extended across the rear elevation.|$|E

40|$|The study compares two product strategies-chips versus firewood-and two {{technological}} levels-manual versus mechanized-as {{applied to}} the thinning of <b>walnut</b> agroforestry <b>plantations,</b> established on ex-arable land. Such plantations are widespread all across Europe, and their establishment was subsidized under the provisions of EU Directive 2080 / 90, and of regional grant schemes. Field test data were used to build a simple deterministic model for estimating thinning productivity and cost under varying work and economic conditions. This model can assist prospective users when checking the profitability of an operation, or when assessing the competitiveness of alternative options. Removing nurse alder from young <b>walnut</b> <b>plantations</b> yields between 25 and 50 t of fresh biomass per hectare and {{is crucial to the}} good development of the stand. The study shows that the removal of nurse alder from <b>walnut</b> <b>plantations</b> is economically viable, and it can also offer some profits if stand and market conditions are favourable. As a rule, the average DBH of removal trees should not be smaller than 12 cm. Best results are obtained with mechanized harvesting, which does not seem to cause heavier stand and soil damage than manual harvesting. Manual harvesting is preferable only if the annual utilization of machinery is very low, and in this case it should be geared to firewood production. The manual whole-tree harvesting (WTH) method used in this study offers the lowest performance under all conditions, and should be replaced with some other manual alternative to WTH. Mechanized WTH offers a significant cost reduction over mechanized short-wood (SWS) harvesting, but this difference is still rather limited: hence, other parameters come into play when deciding what system to apply, and namely product price and mass output. In this respect, one also has to consider the cost of managing the harvesting residue, and that of fertilizing, if soil nutrient depletion is to be feared. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.

40|$|This {{publication}} contains {{information on}} establishing a black <b>walnut</b> <b>plantation.</b> Based on current market conditions, $ 20, 000 to $ 30, 000 worth of black walnut timber can be harvested from a managed acre within 50 years. The {{total cost of}} establishing an acre rarely exceeds $ 100, including site preparation, cost of seedlings, planting, and weed control. The decision {{to invest in a}} <b>walnut</b> <b>plantation</b> can be based on: 1. The rate of return on $ 100 per acre invested is 11. 3 percent to 11. 9 percent, yielding $ 20, 000 to $ 30, 000 within 50 years. The same investment at 6 percent interest would yield $ 1, 842 at the end of 50 years. 2. Ideal sites are stream bottoms, flood plains, or odd corners. Such areas may be placed in walnut production with little or no loss of agricultural production. 3. Historically, walnut has increased in value faster than the inflation rate.

40|$|Aggressive black <b>walnut</b> <b>plantation</b> {{management}} {{will produce}} rapid growth, good form, and marketable products {{much faster than}} plantations allowed to grow without intensive culture. Site quality must be the first consideration in deciding whether to plant walnut. Professional help is essential for this.

Fertile loams and sandy loams with high organic matter and pH from 6. 5 to 7. 2 are usually best. Bottomland soils often meet these requirements, but avoid bottoms with excessive flooding, poor internal drainage, and bedrock or gravel deposits close to the surface.
