Total reflectance (diffuse + specular) was gathered between 250 and 1750 nm using a UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (500 i, Cary) <b>with</b> a diffuse <b>reflectance</b> accessory. The baseline reference measurement was performed <b>with</b> a certified <b>reflectance</b> <b>standard</b> (SRS- 99 - 010, Labsphere). The MWNT surface was further characterized in the infrared region (2. 8 - 10 μm) using a FTIR (Spectrum ONE, Perkin Elmer).

40|$|Sinusoidally {{structured}} illumination is used {{in concert}} with a phantom-based lookup-table (LUT) to map wide-field optical properties in turbid media with reduced albedos as low as 0. 44. A key advantage of the lookup-table approach {{is the ability to}} measure the absorption (μa) and reduced scattering coefficients (μs′) over a much broader range of values than permitted by current diffusion theory methods. Through calibration <b>with</b> a single <b>reflectance</b> <b>standard,</b> the LUT can extract μs′ from 0. 8 to 2. 4 mm− 1 with an average root-mean-square (rms) error of 7 % and extract μa from 0 to 1. 0 mm− 1 with an average rms error of 6 %. The LUT is based solely on measurements of two parameters, reflectance R and modulation M at an illumination period of 10 mm. A single set of three phase-shifted images is sufficient to measure both M and R, which are then used to generate maps of absorption and scattering by referencing the LUT. We establish empirically that each pair (M,R) maps uniquely to only one pair of (μs′,μa) and report that the phase function (i. e., size) of the scatterers can influence the accuracy of optical property extraction...|$|R

40|$|Biconical diffuse {{reflectance}} spectra in the mid-infrared are presented for powder and other solid forms of sulfur, gold, potassium bromide, magnesium oxide, and halon. Comparisons {{are made with}} previously published results of other investigators, and recommendations are made regarding the relative usefulnees of these materials as <b>reflectance</b> <b>standards</b> in the mid-IR. Sulfur has strong intrinsic bands at wavelengths greater than 7 microns that {{must be taken into}} account for its use as a <b>reflectance</b> <b>standard.</b> Some sulfur samples have hydrocarbon contaminants and in powder form may have adsorbed water, both of which produce bands in the 3 - 4 -micron region. Potassium bromide has several weak intrinsic bands and is very sensitive to adsorbed water contamination; otherwise it is a good IR reference material. Magnesium oxide and halon have major bands structure and low reflectivity at wavelengths greater than 2. 6 microns and thus are unsuitable as reference materials in the mid-IR. Vapor-deposited gold on fine sandpaper (600 grit) is very bright, spectrally flat, and fairly diffuse, so it is the superior material (of those examined) for reflectance reference material throughout the IR. Fine gold powder, on the other hand, is much less bright than evaporated gold, and its reflectivity at wavelengths greater than its particle size is highly sensitive to particle packing density...|$|R

Five distinct types of reflectance spectra are identified {{and related to}} differcnccs in water quality. No relationship was found between reflectance and acidification status. A reflectance model based on literature absorbance and scattering cross-sections of water, plant pigments, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and suspended inorganic matter is used to generate reflectance spectra of each reflectance type.

40|$|Satellite {{instruments}} {{operating in}} the reflective solar wavelength region require accurate and precise determination of the Bidirectional Reflectance Factor (BRF) of laboratory-based diffusers used in their pre-flight and on-orbit radiometric calibrations. BRF measurements are required throughout the reflected-solar spectrum from the ultraviolet through the shortwave infrared. Spectralon diffusers are commonly used as a <b>reflectance</b> <b>standard</b> for bidirectional and hemispherical geometries. The Diffuser Calibration Laboratory (DCaL) at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center is a secondary calibration facility <b>with</b> <b>reflectance</b> measurements traceable to those made by the Spectral Tri-function Automated Reference Reflectometer (STARR) facility at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). For more than two decades, the DCaL has provided numerous NASA projects with BRF data in the ultraviolet (UV), visible (VIS) and the Near infraRed (NIR) spectral regions. Presented in this paper are measurements of BRF from 1475 nm to 1625 nm obtained using an indium gallium arsenide detector and a tunable coherent light source. The sample was a 2 inch diameter, 99 % white Spectralon target. The BRF results are discussed and compared to empirically generated data from a model based on NIST certified values of 6 deg directional/hemispherical spectral reflectance factors from 900 nm to 2500 nm. Employing a new NIST capability for measuring bidirectional reflectance using a cooled, extended InGaAs detector, BRF calibration measurements of the same sample were also made using NIST's STARR from 1475 nm to 1625 nm at an incident angle of 0 deg and at viewing angles of 40 deg, 45 deg, and 50 deg. The total combined uncertainty for BRF in this ShortWave Infrared (SWIR) range is less than 1 %. This measurement capability will evolve into a BRF calibration service in SWIR region in support of NASA remote sensing missions.

40|$|The {{digital age}} is profoundly {{changing}} how data is collected, stored and analyzed in the ecological sciences. Where scientists would previously resort to in-situ observations of nature, {{they are now}} increasingly relying on digital recording devices to collect large data-sets. Collected data typically requires annotation in order to yield the desired data-products, but unlike collection, annotation often requires expert skills, which are in short supply. As a consequence, a manual-annotation bottleneck has developed in many disciplines between collected data and desired data-products. Concurrently, significant advances {{have been made in}} automated identification of common objects & scenes using machine learning and computer vision methods. This thesis builds on these advances in order to address the manual- annotation bottleneck in coral reef surveys. The focus on reef surveys was established due to the severity of the manual-annotation bottleneck, and the critical importance of large-scale reef surveys in understanding the contemporary global coral reef crisis. Towards this goal, we investigate several aspects of the data collection and annotation work. First, methods for automated annotation of coral reef survey images are developed and compared to human expert annotators. Random sampling designs and semi- automated frameworks are proposed which enable deployment of automated annotation without sacrificing the estimation quality of derived data-products (e. g. percent coral cover). Such methods are appealing as they fuse the high accuracy of expert annotators with the speed and low cost of automated annotators. Further, a multi-channel annotation algorithm, which utilizes broad-spectrum fluorescence images in conjunction <b>with</b> <b>standard</b> <b>reflectance</b> images, is proposed and shown to significantly reduce the error-rate compared to using reflectance images only. Finally, the developed methods are implemented in a web-portal, CoralNet (coralnet. ucsd. edu), and made publicly available.
