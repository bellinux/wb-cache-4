5|$|Then for {{the next}} week or two Mariah would call me and say, 'What {{do you think about this}} bit?' We would talk a little bit until she got the lyrics all nicely coordinated and done. And then we just waited until the {{sessions}} began, which were in the summer of '94 where <b>we</b> <b>got</b> together in New York and started recording. And that's when we first hear her at the microphone singing, and the rest is history.|$|E
5|$|With Misery we had {{the luxury}} of doing a two-day shoot, which is totally luxurious these days. And <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to do what we love the most, which is just fashion and making {{beautiful}} images, and not having any rules. It was very much on the fly. We went downtown to the abandoned Sears building; it’s all destroyed and creepy in there. We were there for two days and it was like an art project.|$|E
5|$|There {{was this}} {{absolute}} scorching deal on cases of PBR and kegs. We {{were one of}} the few outlets in Portland that sold kegs to go, so we could sell them at a really good deal. So we started the PBR dollar-can special. I'd say it was around 1997 or 1998. At one point, I know they said we were the largest distributor of Pabst in the state, if not the country. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> written up in The New York Times about it. We were going through hundreds of cases and dozens of kegs a week.|$|E

5|$|Because if we'd gone to Baghdad {{we would}} have been all alone. There wouldn't have been anybody else with us. There would have been a U.S. {{occupation}} of Iraq. None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq. Once you got to Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein's government, then {{what are you going to}} put in its place? That's a very volatile part of the world, and if you take down the central government of Iraq, you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off: part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west, part of it—eastern Iraq—the Iranians would like to claim, they fought over it for eight years. In the north you've got the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq. The other thing was casualties. Everyone was impressed with the fact we were able to do our job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families—it wasn't a cheap war. And the question for the president, in terms of whether or not we went on to Baghdad, took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein, was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth? Our judgment was, not very many, and I think <b>we</b> <b>got</b> it right.|$|E

But it would be more difficult to replace him than it would be to replace her, and he knows it. We could get Miss Pettrell at once for Salome, and we should have to look about for a Haxard. Still, I am disposed to drop Godolphin, if Mr. Maxwell feels as I do." ...|$|R

25|$|Meanwhile, Carter was {{burdened}} by a continued weak {{economy and the}} Iran hostage crisis.

John Anderson's independent candidacy, aimed at eliciting support from liberals, was also seen as hurting Carter more than Reagan, especially in such reliably Democratic states such as Massachusetts and New York.|$|E

25|$|So {{we could}} get down to business. We divided the exhibitors in two, those who were headed by Signac and Luce, the other made up of artists of the new generation.

In the following rooms, André Lhote, Segonzac, La Fresnaye etc. would take their place. It was at this moment that <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to know each other.|$|E
25|$|We {{started off}} with no idea at all. We pretty much threw all the stuff in the pot and went on playing. It {{was a case of}} demand driving it.

The thing with the Falcons, we never {{actually}} changed our style that much. We just accumulated new ones.

25|$|We {{were able}} to use archival pieces from Van Cleef & Arpels, which came with a {{revolving}} door of security guards.

There were a couple of times <b>we</b> <b>got</b> caught, scenes got moved up, and lucky for me, Madonna was able to make available her personal jewelry. When you see Wallis spraying the flowers with perfume, her black and white pearl and diamond Bulgari earrings are Madonna's.|$|E
