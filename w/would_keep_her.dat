She {{returned}} to the UK and {{was assigned to the}} 10th Destroyer Flotilla in preparation for the Invasion of Normandy. After D-day, she carried out patrols of the English Channel and the Bay of Biscay.

25|$|Ardent {{continued}} to deploy with the flotilla throughout 1936, but by August the Italian {{military operations in}} Abyssinia, and {{the outbreak of the}} Spanish Civil War caused an increased state of readiness amongst the ships of the Mediterranean Fleet. On 8 September, Ardent and other ships of the flotilla were deployed on non-intervention patrols off the Spanish coast, and provided assistance to British citizens in Spain. She returned to Malta on 17 October. After carrying out a few exercises off Malta, Ardent resumed her Spanish patrols, including providing humanitarian aid to refugees, on 29 November. These activities <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> <b>her</b> occupied throughout December and into 1937.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, EastEnders {{producers}} {{decided to}} reintroduce {{the character of}} Sam Mitchell. Although they initially considered recasting the role to another actress, and despite all her past problems, they decided to give Danniella another chance and she was asked back for a third time. During her time away, Danniella's excessive use of cocaine had completely eroded away her nasal septum. To hide this from the audience, Danniella was only filmed in ways that <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> <b>her</b> septum hidden from view. However, Danniella's drug taking continued and in 2000, {{she was asked to}} leave EastEnders again. In 2001, the character of Sam Mitchell was reintroduced again, but due to Danniella's continuing problems, producers decided to recast. Kim Medcalf became the second actress to play Sam Mitchell, appearing from 29 January 2002 until 17 November 2005.|$|E
25|$|The film's {{score was}} written by John Barry, {{although}} {{some of it was}} replaced by material composed by Sylvester Levay (most notably the music for the scene where Howard and Phil fly the ultralight - Barry's original cue is heard on the soundtrack album). Thomas Dolby wrote the film's songs, and chose the members of Cherry Bomb. Actress Lea Thompson performed her own singing for the role, although she states that the filmmakers were unsure as to whether they <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> <b>her</b> vocals in the final film. Thompson was required to learn choreography with the band and record the songs so they could be synchronized during filming. The final sequence, in which Cherry Bomb performs the film's title song, was shot in front of a live audience in an auditorium in San Francisco. The song was co-written by Dolby and George Clinton. Gale was choreographed to dance and play guitar as Howard. Dolby built a special guitar for Gale to use for rehearsal and filming.|$|E

500|$|Tubman's {{religious}} faith was another important resource as she ventured repeatedly into Maryland. The visions from her childhood head injury continued, {{and she saw}} them as divine premonitions. She spoke of [...] "consulting with God", and trusted that He <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> <b>her</b> safe. Thomas Garrett once said of her, [...] "I never met with any person of any color who had more confidence {{in the voice of}} God, as spoken direct to her soul." [...] Her faith in the divine also provided immediate assistance. She used spirituals as coded messages, warning fellow travelers of danger or to signal a clear path.|$|E

Three torpedoes hit the battleship: two impacted forward of the engine rooms, while the third struck the starboard steering compartment and jammed her rudder in a 15° port turn. Bismarck was forced to sail in circles until a combination of alternating propeller speeds was found which <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> <b>her</b> on a reasonably steady course which, in the prevailing force 8 wind and sea state, forced her to sail towards the British warships with almost no manoeuvring capability.

She expressed concern that a united Germany would align itself more closely with the Soviet Union and move away from NATO. In March 1990, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl reassured Thatcher that he <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> <b>her</b> [...] "informed of all his intentions about unification", and that he was prepared to disclose [...] "matters which even his cabinet would not know". In November 1989, Thatcher hailed the fall of the Berlin Wall as [...] "a great day for freedom".|$|E

500|$|Coolbrith's {{difficulties}} in Oakland followed by her trip to Chicago unsettled her friends {{who did not}} wish to see her move away and [...] "become an alien" [...] to California. John Muir had long been in the habit of sending Coolbrith letters, and the occasional box of fruit such as cherries picked from the trees on his Martinez estate, and he made such an offering in late 1894, accompanied by a suggestion for a new career which he thought <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> <b>her</b> in the area—she could fill the position of San Francisco's librarian, recently vacated by John Vance Cheney. Coolbrith sent a response to Muir, thanking him for [...] "the fruit of your land, and the fruit of your brain". After signing the letter [...] "your old-time friend", she added a post-script comment: [...] "No, I cannot have Mr. Cheney's place. I am disqualified by sex." [...] San Francisco required that their librarian be a man.|$|E
500|$|A {{hamstring}} surgery forced Jackson {{out of the}} 2013 season, and {{she also}} missed the 2014 season after operating both her right knee and left Achilles in February. The final year of her Storm contract was suspended in 2013 and dissolved under the new collective-bargaining agreement signed in 2014, but Seattle still retained Jackson's rights. During her 2014 recovery, Jackson expressed interest in returning to Seattle in 2015, saying that despite so much time sidelined by injury, [...] "I've just had too good of a career there to let that fall by the wayside." [...] However, these hopes of returning to the WNBA and the Storm for the 2015 season were sidelined when Jackson had further surgery on her right knee {{in the spring of}} 2015. Her attentions turned to the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. However, in November 2015, Jackson announced that her rehabilitation had suffered a setback that <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> <b>her</b> from practicing until January 2016. Upon taking the court again, she stated she would decide in February 2016 if she would participate in what would be her fifth Olympic games or retire from the sport. Her retirement was announced one month later.|$|E

[...] These men would soon establish the Anthology Society, precursor to the Boston Athenæum, and become Adams’s lifelong allies and patrons, establishing in 1809 a modest annuity that <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> <b>her</b> out of poverty. It was through the sponsorship of these gentlemen that aided her in preparing her History of the Jews (1812).|$|E

[...] It was Hale {{who came up with the}} lyric idea, which was inspired by a relationship she was going through at the time and revolved around [...] "a strong woman who won't tolerate her man returning to his ex-girlfriend." [...] While Tab and Hale contributed most of the lyrics, Stewart wrote the music and played all of the tracks, with Hale singing on the original demo." ...|$|E

50|$|From {{the times}} of the ancient Egyptians, cases of {{mortuary}} neglect have been recorded.

When the city is doomed by a meteor shower, Kara is sent to Earth by her parents, Zor-El and Alura (unnamed until later issues), to be raised by her cousin Kal-El, known as Superman.

Dutch immigration rules allowed asylum seekers to use grandparents' names. Her grandfather had used the last name Ali until his thirties and then switched to Magan, which was her father's and family's surname. This grandfather's birth year of 1845 had complicated the investigation. (Hirsi Ali's father Hirsi Magan Isse {{was the youngest of}} his many children and born when her grandfather was close to 90). Later the same day Hirsi Ali, through her lawyer and in television interviews, stated that she had signed the resignation letter, drafted by the Justice Department, under duress. She felt it was forced in order for her to keep her passport, but she had not wanted to complicate her pending visa application for the U.S. [...] she still carried her Dutch passport.|$|E
