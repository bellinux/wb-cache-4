5000|$|Magnet wire {{is solid}} wire, usually copper, which, to allow closer winding when making {{electromagnetic}} coils, is insulated only with varnish, {{rather than the}} thicker plastic or other insulation commonly used on electrical wire.

50|$|A bifilar coil is an {{electromagnetic}} coil that contains two closely spaced, parallel windings. In engineering, the word bifilar describes wire {{which is made}} of two filaments or strands. It is commonly used to denote special types of <b>winding</b> <b>wire</b> for transformers. Wire can be purchased in bifilar form, usually as different colored enameled wire bonded together. For three strands, the term trifilar coil is used.|$|E
50|$|Flatwound strings {{also have}} either a round or hex core. However, the <b>winding</b> <b>wire</b> has a rounded square {{cross-section}} {{that has a}} shallower profile (in cross-section) when tightly wound. This makes for more comfortable playing, and decreased wear for frets and fretboards (this makes them a popular choice for fretless instruments). Squeaking sounds due to fingers sliding along the strings are also decreased significantly. Flatwound strings also have a longer playable life because of smaller grooves for dirt and oil to build up in.|$|E

5000|$|Halfwound strings, ground wound strings, or {{pressure}} wound strings are a {{cross between}} roundwound and flatwound. Such strings are usually made by winding round wire around a round or hex core first, then polishing, grinding (thus the name, ground wound) or pressing the exterior part of the winding until it is practically flat. This results in the flat, comfortable playing feel of flatwounds, along with less squeaking, with a brightness generally between roundwounds and flatwounds. The polishing process removes {{almost half of the}} winding wire's mass; thus, to compensate for it, manufacturers use <b>winding</b> <b>wire</b> of a heavier gauge. Because of the extra manufacturing process involved they are normally more expensive than roundwounds, but less than flatwounds.|$|E
50|$|To {{efficiently}} wind {{the pole}} shoes lying close together of electronically commutated multipole three-phase motors, {{they will be}} coated with insulation and directly wound with the needle winding method. A needle with a nozzle that is placed at a right angle to the direction of movement travels in a lifting motion passing the stator packs through the groove channel between the two neighboring poles of the motor to drop the wire in the desired place. The stator is then turned at the reversal point on the winding head by one tooth pitch so that the previous process can run again in reverse order. With this winding technology a specific layer structure can be realized. The disadvantage is {{that there must be}} a clearance between two adjacent poles with a size of at least the nozzle diameter. The nozzle diameter is about three times the diameter of the <b>winding</b> <b>wire.</b> The space between two adjacent poles can therefore not be filled completely.|$|E

The layer is formed {{in such a manner}} that the thermal resistance between the layer and the units is small relative to the resistance of the wire between end windings and the point. An electrically-conducting connection is provided between the layer and electronic components (7, 8). DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The electrically-conducting layer is applied to thermally-conducting and electrically-insulating substrates and cooling units (11, 13). USE - Used in an electromagnetic actuator e. g. solenoid and valve drive. ADVANTAGE - The contact point connects the <b>winding</b> <b>wires</b> to the electrically-conducting layer, thus contacting the windings with electronic components in a simple and reliable manner, and achieving thermal isolation of the windings from the electronic components, and hence avoiding entry of harmful heat from the windings to the components. The device reduces the spatial range between the electronic components and the machine, thereby providing a compact structure. The device provides improved electromagnetic compatibility and eliminates the need for plugging and connecting units of housing parts and the components for electromagnetic filtering, thus reducing the cost of the device...|$|R
5000|$|Anderson {{was drawn}} to extend the {{application}} of copper thread from large-scale architectures to objects. In the artist’s words, [...] "I always worry to break or lose an object, therefore I have established rules: {{when one of the}} objects around me is likely to become obsolete or is lost in stream of our lives, I ‘memorise’ it with thread before it happens." [...] Anderson has ’memorised’ all manner of objects from the complete ‘weaving’ of objects in her studio to a car, remembering the physicality of an object through the exploration of its materiality and physical extremities. The process of <b>winding</b> <b>wire</b> around objects takes Anderson into a meditative and rhythmic space of repetition, with movements akin to dance. Anderson connects with the objects in two ways: first, as substitutes for human interaction as she says that in her childhood she had [...] "a very hard time connecting with people, and most of the time, my emotions weren't tied up with the person I had in front me, but rather with the objects associated with the moment of my relation with them"; secondly, this process is a way of recording and charging objects by printing them with the signature of her movement. It is, in that sense, practical rather than nostalgic. This body of work is termed ‘Memorised Objects’.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a {{study of}} Swedish manufacturers of insulated <b>winding</b> <b>wire</b> and the market forces surrounding the industry between 1945 and 1980. As part of the chain of subcontractors, the <b>winding</b> <b>wire</b> industry was linked to all three major electro-technical manufacturers of the time, ASEA, Electrolux and LM Ericsson. The Wallenberg Group’s initiatives to create boundaries for what the manufacturers were to produce also came to influence manufacturers of <b>winding</b> <b>wire</b> and their subsequent focus on high- and low voltage current products and systems respectively. Increasing sales of electro-technical products that became the norm in industry {{as well as in}} private homes after 1945 to a great extent created the demand for <b>winding</b> <b>wire.</b> In response to an increasing demand for <b>winding</b> <b>wire</b> Ernst Dahrén developed the family company in Jonslund, a predominantly rural area that lacked job opportunities. The specialisation of <b>winding</b> <b>wire</b> manufacturing enabled the company to carefully select loyal employees who accepted lower wages and were willing to work in three shifts, thereby creating a competitive advantage for the company. Product pricing was governed by the prices of copper and aluminium as well as costs and discounts for the rod wire used in the production of <b>winding</b> <b>wire.</b> Together with Ernst Dahrén’s entrepreneurial and patriarchal leadership style which highly influenced the company culture, the family’s tendency to re-invest profits became an important foundation for the company’s autonomy and expansion until its acquisition by the ASEA in 1973...|$|E

In the reflection spectrum, sideband peaks are {{created as a}} result of mechanically induced modulation on the grating period, and a higher number of peaks are observed when greater modulation is applied. The peak wavelength spacing depends upon the period of microbending, which can be varied by changing the diameter of the <b>winding</b> <b>wire</b> or the angle of placement of fiber Bragg grating placed in between the two wound slabs. Moreover, the trend of Bragg transmission loss (BTL) for the transmission spectrum changes with the changing of modulation period and amplitude.

National fire statistics in 2013 show that a total of 263 fires occurred in the cooling equipment and the number of electric fan has 145 fire cases. This is accounted for 55. 1 % of the whole. Electric fan is the electrical appliance that the heat is generated on the <b>winding</b> <b>wire</b> and the iron core. If such characteristic is not controled properly, fire would break out at the electric fan. also there is a gap filled with an insulator between connection terminals of the capacitor in the electric fan. But in case that the gap on the capacitor is covered with some conductive material such as dust, there would be a fire as well caused by electrical heating locally. Although many studies related with those have been conducted, electric fan fire is continuously occurred. In this study, thermal characteristics and current signal in various conditions such as the heat generation of windings including iron cores of the motor and the dielectric breakdown of terminals on the capacitor connected to the motor were detected.

40|$|An LCL filter is used {{between the}} grid and the grid {{converter}} to attenuate the switching harmonics. The LCL filter {{is one of}} the bulkiest and heaviest components in the grid-connected converter. The size of the LCL filter can be decreased significantly using higher switching frequencies enabled by next generation semiconductors. Further size reduction can be achieved using air-forced cooling conditions. This thesis presents the compact design of a converter-side inductor of an LCL filter. The design is implemented using the area product approach. The core material of the inductor is selected based on the highest peak flux density within saturation and core-loss density limits. Both the fundamental and the high frequency effects are considered to calculate the peak flux density. The <b>winding</b> <b>wire</b> is selected based on the rms current density. The gapped core is considered for the design and the effect of fringing flux on the inductance is studied. The thermal modeling of the inductor is included in the design.
