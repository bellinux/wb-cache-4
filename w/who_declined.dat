5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Napoleonic Wars and the {{subsequent}} agricultural depression, coupled {{with the collapse of the}} Tonbridge Bank in 1812, Woodgate was declared bankrupt in 1816. In that year, Woodgate offered Somerhill for sale to the Duke of Wellington, <b>who</b> <b>declined</b> to buy it as the foxhunting was not good enough for his liking. Somerhill was bought from the descendants of William Woodgate in November 1819 by James Alexander, MP. By 1830, Somerhill had been substantially repaired, and new landscaping was undertaken. In 1832, Anthony Salvin was engaged to make improvements to the house, but retaining its original style. During the severe winter of 1835-36, skating was possible on the lake at Somerhill for four weeks.|$|E
5|$|Ganesan {{originally}} {{offered the}} role of Vellaiyathevan to S. S. Rajendran, <b>who</b> <b>declined</b> it due to {{his commitment to the}} film Sivagangai Seemai (1959). He later requested actress Savitri to ask her husband Gemini Ganesan to play the role, which she agreed to do despite being pregnant at that time. Gemini Ganesan was initially reluctant to accept the role, but eventually agreed. Padmini, O. A. K. Thevar, and V. K. Ramasamy were chosen to play Vellaiyammal, Oomaithurai and Ettappan respectively. S. Varalakshmi played Kattabomman's wife, Jakkamma, and also worked as a playback singer.|$|E

Edward {{subsequently}} extended the grounds of Beatrice's home, Osborne Cottage, to compensate her for the impending loss of her privacy. Shortly afterwards, the King declared to Arthur Balfour, the Prime Minister, that the main house would go to the nation as a gift. An exception was made for the private apartments, which were closed to all but the royal family members, who made it a shrine to their mother's memory.|$|E

5|$|In 1929, Walter Lowenfels jokingly {{suggested}} that Aldington should {{produce a new}} Imagist anthology. Aldington, by now a successful novelist, took up the suggestion and {{enlisted the help of}} Ford and H.D. The result was the Imagist Anthology 1930, edited by Aldington and including all the contributors to the four earlier anthologies with the exception of Lowell, who had died, Cannell, who had disappeared, and Pound, <b>who</b> <b>declined.</b> The appearance of this anthology initiated a critical discussion of the place of the Imagists in the history of 20th-century poetry.|$|E

Originally set for filming {{in the spring of}} 2009, it was postponed because of her work on Inglourious Basterds. Knowing that she could speak French, and had already acted in French in one of the short films in Paris, je t'aime, she offered the first role to Natalie Portman, <b>who</b> <b>declined</b> because of the script's language.|$|E
5|$|At {{the launch}} of the film in July2009, Thiagarajan {{announced}} that 36 prominent actors would play lead roles with a hundred others in supporting roles. The invitation cards for the launch had 3D holographic designs which won the Sappi awards of the year 2009. Aishwarya Rai and Deepika Padukone were initially considered for the female lead roles, before Miss India 2009 Pooja Chopra and Divya Parameshwaran accepted the roles. The producers initially listed Sathyaraj in its cast, later replaced by Prabhu. Approximately 5000 junior artists and 1000 artists from the annual Chennai Sangamam had reportedly taken part in the film. For music, Thiagarajan approached A. R. Rahman in 2008 <b>who</b> <b>declined</b> the offer, and Ilaiyaraaja eventually replaced him.

5|$|During the 1986–87 season, the Broncos {{relocated}} to Swift Current, Saskatchewan, becoming the Swift Current Broncos. Sakic, {{playing in his}} first full season, was named Rookie of the Year of the WHL. He notched 60 goals and 73 assists for 133 points. But while Sakic enjoyed success on the ice, {{he and his team}} faced a tragedy on the night of December 30, 1986. The Broncos were driving to a game against the Regina Pats, and due to bad weather conditions, the bus crashed after the driver lost control on a patch of black ice outside of Swift Current. While Sakic was unharmed, four of his teammates (Trent Kresse, Scott Kruger, Chris Mantyka and Brent Ruff) were killed. This incident had a lasting impact on the young Sakic, <b>who</b> <b>declined</b> to talk about the crash throughout his career. The next year, in 1987–88, Sakic was named the WHL Most Valuable Player and Canadian Major Junior Player of the Year. He scored 160 points (78 goals, 82 assists), tying him with Theoren Fleury of the Moose Jaw Warriors for the WHL scoring title.|$|E
5|$|During the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) tour of South Africa during 1948–49, {{the first}} under apartheid, the BBC {{commentator}} John Arlott was horrified {{when he saw}} a black man assaulted for no reason. This prompted him to visit several townships where he found black people living in very poor conditions. He contrasted this unfavourably with the luxury of the homes where he was entertained by white families. Billy Griffith, one of the touring team, accompanied him on one visit to a township, and was similarly appalled, but did not speak out against it. Arlott later condemned apartheid, during a 1950 BBC broadcast, and refused to commentate during future tours to the country. His example was followed by the England batsman and clergyman David Sheppard, <b>who</b> <b>declined</b> to tour South Africa, refused to play the team in 1960, and spoke out publicly against the policies of the South African government despite efforts by the MCC to silence him. Otherwise, there was little protest in England against South African cricket during the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Early fossil {{remains were}} fragmentary, {{which led to}} much {{speculation}} on the posture and nature of Iguanodon. Iguanodon was initially portrayed as a quadrupedal horn-nosed beast. However, as more bones were discovered, Mantell observed that the forelimbs were {{much smaller than the}} hindlimbs. His rival Owen was of the opinion it was a stumpy creature with four pillar-like legs. The job of overseeing the first lifesize reconstruction of dinosaurs was initially offered to Mantell, <b>who</b> <b>declined</b> due to poor health, and Owen's vision subsequently formed the basis on which the sculptures took shape. Its bipedal nature was revealed with the discovery of the Bernissart skeletons. However, it was depicted in an upright posture, with the tail dragging along the ground, acting as the third leg of a tripod.|$|E

5|$|In {{the weeks}} {{following}} the game, several players from each team announced their intentions {{to enter the}} 1998 NFL Draft. North Carolina defender Dre Bly was among a handful of eligible players (the National Football League requires a player {{to be at least}} three years out of high school) <b>who</b> <b>declined</b> to enter the draft, instead choosing to return to school for another year. North Carolina had seven players taken in the draft, three of whom were selected in the first round: Greg Ellis was taken with the eighth pick, Brian Simmons with the 17th pick, and Vonnie Holliday with the 19th pick. The four remaining selections were Omar Brown (103rd overall), Kivuusama Mays (110th), Robert Williams (128th), and Jonathan Linton (131st). Virginia Tech had no players taken in the first round during the 1998 draft, but four players were taken in later rounds: Todd Washington (104th overall), Gennaro DiNapoli (109th), Ken Oxendine (201st), and Marcus Parker (202nd).|$|E

The following night on ECW on Sci Fi, Van Dam lost the ECW title to The Big Show, after the Big Show received assistance from Paul Heyman, <b>who</b> <b>declined</b> to make the three-count for Van Dam, but instead gave the pinfall to the Big Show.

5|$|President James Monroe's {{first choice}} for Secretary of War was Henry Clay, <b>who</b> <b>{{declined}}</b> the office. When Johnson also declined to serve, the post ultimately went to John C. Calhoun. The {{result was that}} Johnson became chair of the Committee on Expenditures where he wielded considerable influence over defense policy in the Department of War during the Fifteenth Congress. In 1817, Congress investigated General Andrew Jackson's execution of two British subjects during the First Seminole War. Johnson chaired the inquiry committee. The majority of the committee favored a negative report and a censure for Jackson. Johnson, a Jackson supporter, drafted a counter report that was more favorable to Jackson and opposed the censure. The ensuing debate pitted Johnson against fellow Kentuckian Henry Clay. Johnson's report prevailed, and Jackson was spared censure. This disagreement between Johnson and Clay, however, {{marked the beginning of}} a political separation between the two that lasted for the duration of their careers.|$|E

Tate was the second choice for the part; Cartier had previously offered it to André Morell, <b>who</b> <b>declined</b> the role. (Morell did later play Quatermass in the third instalment of the series, Quatermass and the Pit.) Victor Carroon was played by Scottish actor Duncan Lamont, who later appeared in the film Mutiny on the Bounty (1962), and as a different character in the film adaptation of Quatermass and the Pit (1967). He enjoyed working on The Quatermass Experiment so much that, although he was not required for the final episode, he went to Alexandra Palace to lend moral support. While there, he helped Kneale and Kerr to prepare their 'monster' prop.|$|E
5|$|There {{were now}} four {{possible}} actions for theft, by the victim: the action furti itself and three complementary actions. The actio furti concepti was available against the occupier {{of the building}} in which the stolen goods were found, regardless of his knowledge of them and brought three-times damages. The actio furti prohibiti could be pursued against anyone <b>who</b> <b>declined</b> a search with witnesses, with four-times damages. The actio furti non exhibiti could be brought if the respondent did not bring the thing to court, although its penalty is unclear. There was a further action available to the respondent of an actio furti concepti who had been found liable: he could sue the person who gave it to him, for {{the extent of his}} own liability. That the victim could sue both the thief and handler, if he could show who the thief was, which would have difficult without the presence of the thing. This was both penal, and an attempt to give the plaintiff enough actions to compensate him, because the thief, at least was not usually solvent.|$|E
5|$|Clouzot's health {{problems}} {{kept him from}} military service. In 1939, he met actor Pierre Fresnay, who was already an established film star in France. Clouzot wrote the script for Fresnay's only directorial feature Le Duel, {{as well as two}} plays for him: On prend les mêmes, which was performed in December 1940, and Comédie en trois actes, which was performed in 1942. Despite writing scripts for films and plays, Clouzot was so poor that he resorted to trying to sell lyrics to French singer Édith Piaf, <b>who</b> <b>declined</b> to purchase them. After France was invaded by Germany and subsequently during the German occupation of France during World War II, the German-operated film production company Continental Films was established in France in October 1940. Alfred Grevin, the director of Continental, knew Clouzot from Berlin and offered him work to adapt stories of writer Stanislas-André Steeman. Clouzot felt uncomfortable working for the Germans, but was in desperate need of money and could not refuse Grevin's offer. Clouzot's first film for Continental was the adaptation of Steeman's mystery novel Six hommes mort (Six Dead Men). Clouzot retitled the film Le Dernier des six, having been influenced by actress Suzy Delair while writing the script, allowing her to choose the name of the character she would play.|$|E
