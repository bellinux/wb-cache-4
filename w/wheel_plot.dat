40|$|ABSTRACT The ~/-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors are {{the major}} inhibitory, postsynaptic, {{neurotransmitter}} receptors in the central nervous system. The binding of~/-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to the GABAA receptors induces the opening of an anion-selective channel that remains open for tens of milliseconds before it closes. To understand how {{the structure of the}} GABA A receptor determines the functional properties such as ion conduction, ion selectivity and gating we sought to identify the amino acid residues that line the ion conducting channel. To accomplish this we mutated 26 consecutive residues (250 - 275), one at a time, in and flanking the M 2 membrane-spanning segment of the rat c ~ t subunit to cysteine. We expressed the mutant ~ 1 subunit with wild-type [31 and ~/ 2 subunits in Xenopus oocytes. We probed the accessibility of the engineered cysteine to covalent modification by charged, sulfhydryl-specific reagents added extracellularly. We assume that among residues in membrane-spanning segments, only those lining the channel would be susceptible to modification by polar reagents and that such modification would irreversibly alter conduction through the channel.

40|$|Wheel traffic {{can lead}} to {{compaction}} and degradation of soil physical properties. This study, {{as part of a}} research on controlled traffic farming, assessed the impact of compaction from wheel traffic on filtration properties of the soil that had not been trafficked for five years. Soil compaction induced by different rear axle weight was conducted on a clay soil to simulate effects of traffic typical of grain production operations in the northern Australian grain belt. A portable rainfall simulator was used to determine infiltration characteristics. Crop performance was also monitored. Time to ponding, steady infiltration rates and total infiltration were reduced significantly with axle load, although the soil surface was covered by 80 per cent crop residue. Poor crop establishment occurred on the <b>wheeled</b> <b>plots,</b> where plants were generally unhealthy compared with those under non-wheeled plots. Roots of plants on the <b>wheeled</b> <b>plots</b> were not able to penetrate the soil, while those from non-wheeled plots were longer and denser. Mean dry matter production of sweet corn decreased with axle loads, but none of these differences were significant. These results demonstrated that soil compaction induced by wheel traffic has significant effects on infiltration properties and crop performance. The exclusion of wheel traffic under a controlled traffic farming system, combined with residue cover under conservation tillage practices, provides a way to enhance the sustainability of cropping this soil for improved infiltration, increased stored soil water and reduced runoff and environmental damage...|$|R
40|$|Traffic and tillage {{effects on}} runoff, soil water and crop {{production}} under rainfall were investigated {{over a period}} of 6 years on a heavy clay vertosols (vertisols) in Queensland, Australia. A split plot design was used to isolate traffic effects, while the cropping program and treatments were broadly representative of extensive grain production practice in the northern grain region of Australia. Treatments subject to zero tillage and stubble mulch tillage each comprised pairs of 90 m 2 plots, from which runoff was recorded. A 3 m wide controlled traffic system allowed one of each pair to be maintained as a non-wheeled plot, while the complete surface area of the other received a single annual wheeling treatment from a working 100 kW tractor. Mean annual runoff from controlled traffic plots was 81 mm (36. 3 %) smaller than that from <b>wheeled</b> <b>plots,</b> while runoff from zero tillage was reduced by 31 mm (15. 7 %). Traffic and tillage effects appeared to be cumulative, so the mean annual runoff from controlled traffic and zero tillage plots, representing best practice, was 112 mm (47. 2 %) less than that from <b>wheeled</b> stubble mulch <b>plots,</b> representing conventional cropping practice. Rainfall infiltration into controlled traffic zero tillage soil was thus 12. 0 % greater than into wheeled stubble mulched soil. Rainfall/runoff hydrographs show that wheeling produced a large and consistent increase in runoff, whereas tillage produced a smaller increase. Treatment effects were greater on dry soil, but were still present in large and intense rainfall events on wet soil. Plant available water capacity (PAWC) in the 0 – 500 mm zone increased by 10 mm (11. 5 %) and mean grain yields increased by 337 kg/ha (9. 4 %) in controlled traffic <b>plots,</b> compared with <b>wheeled</b> <b>plots.</b> Mean grain yield of zero tillage was 2 – 8 % greater than that of stubble mulch plots for all crops except for winter wheat in 1994 and 1998. Increased infiltration and plant available water were probably responsible for increased mean grain yields of 497 kg/ha (14. 5 %) in controlled traffic zero tillage, compared with wheeled stubble mulch treatments. Dissipation of tractive and tillage energy in the soil is the apparent mechanism of deleterious effects on the soils ability to support productive cropping in this environment. Controlled traffic and conservation tillage farming systems appear to be a practicable solution.

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, ten {{different}} silk fibroin proteins (SFs) {{retrieved from}} Swiss-Prot database are analyzed and characterized using In silico tools. Primary structure analysis shows {{that all the}} SFs are hydrophobic in nature due to the high content of non-polar residues. The presence of very few or lack of cystein in SFs shows that disulphide links are absent in the silk fibroin proteins. The presence of extensive hydrogen bonds may provide the stability to protein in absence of disulphide bonds. The aliphatic index computed by ExPasy's ProtParam infers that SFs may be stable at wide range of temperature. Secondary structure analysis shows {{that most of the}} SFs have predominant ∝-helical structure, some have β-helical structure and the rest shows mixed secondary structure. The very high coil structural content of wild silk moth, nursery web spider and earth bumble bee is due to the rich content of highly flexible glycine and hydrophobic alanine amino acids. SOSUI server predicts one transmembrane region in wild silk moth, silk moth and pine moth SFs. The predicted transmembrane regions were visualized and analyzed using helical <b>wheel</b> <b>plots</b> generated by EMBOSS pepwheel tool.

40|$|Traffic and tillage {{effects on}} runoff and crop {{performance}} on a heavy clay soil were investigated {{over a period of}} 4 years. Tillage treatments and the cropping program were representative of broadacre grain production practice in northern Australia, and a split-plot design used to isolate traffic effects. Treatments subject to zero, minimum, and stubble mulch tillage each comprised pairs of 90 -m 2 plots, from which runoff was recorded. A 3 -m-wide controlled traffic system allowed one of each pair to be maintained as a non-wheeled plot, while the total surface area of the other received a single annual wheeling treatment from a working 100 -kW tractor. Rainfall/runoff hydrographs demonstrate that wheeling produced a large and consistent increase in runoff, whereas tillage produced a smaller increase. Treatment effects were greater on dry soil, but were still maintained in large and intense rainfall events on wet soil. Mean annual runoff from <b>wheeled</b> <b>plots</b> was 63 mm (44 %) greater than that from controlled traffic plots, whereas runoff from stubble mulch tillage plots was 38 mm (24 %) greater than that from zero tillage plots. Traffic and tillage effects appeared to be cumulative, so the mean annual runoff from wheeled stubble mulch tilled plots, representing conventional cropping practice, was more than 100 mm greater than that from controlled traffic zero tilled plots, representing best practice. This increased infiltration was reflected in an increased yield of 16 % compared with wheeled stubble mulch. Minimum tilled plots demonstrated a characteristic midway between that of zero and stubble mulch tillage. The results confirm that unnecessary energy dissipation in the soil during the traction process that normally accompanies tillage has a major negative effect on infiltration and crop productivity. Controlled traffic farming systems appear to be the only practicable solution to this problem...|$|R

40|$|Transport of {{nitrogen}} (N) and phosphorus (P) in runoff {{was measured using}} a rainfall simulator on a cotton hill-furrow system {{with a range of}} on-ground cover (0 - 60 %), each with and without prior wheel traffic in the furrow. Total N and P losses in runoff (kg/ha) from the bare plots on a whole-field basis (wheel and non-wheel tracks) were equivalent to 1. 5 % and 1 %, respectively, of fertiliser applied that season (218 kg N/ha, 27 kg P/ha). This was for a single runoff event of 17 mm, about 1 / 10 of the total runoff expected in a season. Retaining surface cover and avoiding wheel traffic were both effective in reducing runoff losses of total N and P, especially when used together. Retaining cover gave considerably lower concentrations of total P, and of N and P associated with sediment, with no significant differences (P > 0. 05) between wheel and non-wheel tracks. The majority of nutrients were transported with sediment, for P for all treatments, and for N from low cover plots. Concentrations of dissolved N, dominantly as NO 3 -N, were unaffected by cover on non-wheel tracks but increased with cover on <b>wheel</b> track <b>plots</b> where runoff occurred as shallow interflow. On a whole-field basis, N was mainly in dissolved form at higher covers, because most runoff came from wheel tracks where interflow occurred. Reducing the ratio of wheel tracks to non-wheel tracks will reduce runoff of N and P. Interflow or exfiltration above an infiltration throttle layer is a worst-case scenario for runoff transport of soluble, poorly sorbed chemicals such as NO 3 -N, which would otherwise leach and not enter runoff. To improve water quality, for both sorbed and dissolved forms, the combination of retaining cover and avoiding wheel traffic and subsoil compaction is needed. Similarly, land uses involving high nutrient inputs should be avoided on soils with shallow subsurface restrictions to infiltration, which are thus prone to interflow. Primary (dispersed) clay and silt were slightly enriched in sediment in runoff, while primary fine and coarse sand were depleted. However, sediments were not enriched in total N and P compared with the soil surface, and organic carbon was only slightly enriched (enrichment ratio 1. 06). This is typical of the behaviour of well-aggregated soils of high clay content. No Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|New Zealand's {{greenhouse}} gas inventory {{is dominated by}} the agricultural trace gases, CH 4 and N 2 O instead of CO 2, which is dominant on a global scale. While the majority of the anthropogenic CH 4 is emitted by ruminant animals as a by-product of enteric fermentation, N 2 O is mainly produced by microbial processes occurring in the soil. In grazed pastoral soils, N 2 O is generated from N originating from dung, urine, effluent applied to land, biologically fixed N 2 and fertiliser. The amount of emission depends on complex interactions between soil properties, climatic factors and management practices. Increased intensification of pastoral agriculture in New Zealand, particularly in dairying has led to an increased production of farm dairy effluent. Traditionally, direct disposal of nutrient rich farm dairy effluents (FDE) into water bodies was an acceptable practice in New Zealand, but with the introduction of the Resource Management Act (1991), discharge of effluents into surface waters is now a controlled activity and many Regional Councils encourage the land irrigation of effluents to protect surface water quality. While the impact of grazing and FDE irrigation on groundwater contamination through leaching and runoff of nutrients has been studied extensively, there has been only limited work done on the effect of these practices on air quality as affected by N 2 O emission. This thesis examines the effects of various factors, such as compaction due to cattle treading, and the nature, application rate and time of effluent application on N 2 O emission in relation to the changes in the soil physical properties and C and N transformation from a number of small plot and field experiments. The results were then used, together with data from the literature, to predict the emissions from effluent irrigated pastures using a process-based model. In grazed pastures, animal treading causes soil compaction, which results in decreased soil porosity and increased water filled pore space that stimulate the denitrification rate as well as influence the relative output of N 2 O and dinitrogen (N 2) gases. A field plot study was conducted to determine N 2 O emission from different N sources as affected by soil compaction. The experiment comprised two main treatments (uncompacted and compacted) to which four N sources (natural cattle urine, potassium nitrate, ammonium sulphate and urea at the rate of 600 kg N ha- 1) and a control (water only) were applied. Compaction was obtained through driving close parallel tracks by the wheels of the vehicle. The changes in the soils physical properties (bulk density, penetration resistance (PR), soil matric potential and oxygen diffusion rate (ODR) due to the compaction created by the wheel traction of the vehicle were compared with the changes in these properties due to the treading effect of grazing cattle, which was monitored in another field experiment. The N 2 O fluxes were measured using a closed chamber technique. The compaction at the grazing trial and at the <b>wheel</b> traction experimental <b>plot</b> caused significant changes in soil bulk density, PR, soil matric potential and ODR values. Overall, the bulk density of the compacted soil was higher than the uncompacted soil by 6. 7 % (end of 3 weeks) and 4. 9 % (end of 1 week) for the field experiment and the grazing trial, respectively. Results suggest that maximum compaction occurred in the top 0 - 2 cm layer. Compaction caused an increase in N 2 O emission, which was more pronounced in the nitrate treatment than in the other N sources. In the case of the compacted soil, 10 % of the total N applied in the form of nitrate was emitted, whereas from uncompacted soil this loss was only 0. 7 %. N 2 O loss was found to decrease progressively from the time of application of N treatments. Total N 2 O emission for the three month experimental period ranged from 2. 6 to 61. 7 kg N 2 O-N ha- 1 for compacted soil and 1. 1 to 4. 4 kg N 2 O-N ha- 1 for uncompacted soil. In the second field plot experiment, the results of N 2 O fluxes from treated farm dairy effluent (TFDE), untreated farm dairy effluent (UFDE), treated piggery farm effluent (TPFE) and treated meat effluent (TME) applied to 2 m x 1 m plots for 'autumn' (February-April) and 'winter' (July-September) are described. Effluent irrigation resulted in higher emissions during both the seasons indicating that the supply of C and N through effluent irrigation contributed to increased N 2 O emission. The highest emissions were observed from TPFE (2. 2 % of the applied N) and TME (0. 6 % of the applied N) during the autumn and winter seasons, respectively. Emissions generated by the TFDE application were the lowest of the four effluent sources but higher than the water and control treatments. The effect of effluent irrigation on N 2 O emission was higher during the autumn season than the winter season. The effect of key soil and effluent factors such as water filled pore space (WFPS), nitrate, ammonium and available C in soil and effluents on N 2 O emission was examined using regression equations. The third field plot experiment examined the effect of four TFDE application rates (25 mm, 50 mm, 75 mm and 100 mm) on N 2 O emission. Treatments were added to 2 m x 1 m plots lined with plastic sheet to restrict the flow of effluent. The N 2 O emission increased with the increasing effluent loading rate, with the emission ranging from 0. 8 to 1. 2 % of the added N. This {{can be attributed to the}} increasing addition of N and C in the soil with the increasing application rate of the effluent. Besides, providing C and N substrates, the effluent application increased the WFPS of the soil, thereby creating conditions conducive for dentrification and N 2 O emission. A field experiment was conducted at the Massey University No 4 Dairy farm in which N 2 O emission and related soil and environmental parameters were monitored for two weeks following the TFDE applications over an area of 0. 16 ha in September 2003 (21 mm), January 2004 (23 mm) and February 2004 (16 mm). Emissions were measured by a closed chamber technique with 20 chambers for each treatment, in order to cover the variability present in the field. N 2 O emissions increased immediately after the application of the effluent, and subsequently dropped after about two weeks. The total N 2 O emitted from the effluent application after the first, second and third irrigation was 2 %, 4. 9 % and 2. 5 %, respectively of the total N added through the effluent. The higher emission observed during the second effluent irrigation event was due to high soil moisture content during the measurement period. Moreover effluent was applied immediately after a grazing event leading to more N and C input into the soil through excretal deposition. In this experiment the residual effect of effluent application on N 2 O emission was also examined by monitoring emissions 12 weeks after the effluent application. The emissions from the control and effluent irrigated plots were similar, indicating that there was no residual effect of the effluent irrigation on N 2 O emissions. In a separate field study, N 2 O emission was monitored at the Massey University No 4 Dairy farm to examine the effect of a grazing event of moderate intensity on N 2 O emission. The treatments consisted of a grazed and an ungrazed control. The fluxes from the grazed site were much higher than for the ungrazed site with the total emissions from the former site being 8 times higher than the latter site for the entire experimental period. A modified New Zealand version of denitrification decomposition model (DNDC), a process based model, namely "NZ-DNDC", was used to simulate N 2 O emission from the TFDE application in the field experiment. The model was able to simulate the emission as well as the WFPS within the range measured in the field. But simulated emissions from the TFDE were slightly lower than measured values. Improvements in the parameterisation for effluent irrigation are likely to further improve the N 2 O simulations...|$|R
