Both men were suspected of suffering form chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a disorder linked to repeated brain trauma. Perry's widow, Donna, told the San Francisco Chronicle that she believes her husband suffered from CTE. She further told the newspaper that [...] "When Joe was playing, they'd give them smelling salts and put them back in. [...] "Now the equipment is better, and they're looking into ways to protect them. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> what this is doing to our children." ...|$|E
500|$|Money was {{borrowed}} from Britain {{to fund the}} state's programs and at an unprecedented rate. Over £230 million was extended in loans from the City of London to state and Commonwealth treasuries during the 1920s. A further £140 million arrived through private investment. Bruce's plan for Australian economic development needed a much stronger role for the Commonwealth government than had been traditionally accepted. Both he and Page were [...] "conspicuously national rather than federal in their outlook" [...] and sought major changes to federal-state relations in order implement their development policy. Increasingly our problems are becoming national in character... Our financial resources are curtailed {{and there is an}} immediate repercussion throughout the Commonwealth. All our problems are common problems. None can be prosperous unless all are prospering. I am more convinced that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> all our problems with the eyes of a nation and not as individuals. Where a great problem confronts a State it may be solved by the cooperation of the Commonwealth {{for the benefit of the}} States, and the benefit and advancement of the whole of Australia.|$|E
500|$|Despite general favor from female viewers' perspective, {{reaction}} from most male viewers was negative. The music video {{was presented to}} a crowd during a promotional party at the Chelsea nightclub Centro-Fly, thrown in celebration of Voodoos January 2000 release. According to a New York Times correspondent, one female viewer at the party [...] "recalled sitting at home, staring at the video, while her boyfriend snapped, 'Turn the channel — I don't {{want to see that}} gay stuff'". D'Angelo made an appearance at the WQHT Hot 97 studio as the DJ's Angie Martinez and Funkmaster Flex fielded calls from listeners about the video. Tracy Cloherty, program director for the radio station at the time, later commented on the divided reaction to the music video in an interview for The New York Times in 2000, stating [...] "Of course, most of the women loved it. Some of the men said things like: 'We don't wanna see that kind of stuff. Why do <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> that?' Men definitely seem to be threatened by male nudity". Some viewers and music writers have attributed the male discomfort of the video to fear of male sexual objectification and homophobia. In a 2000 phone interview for The New York Times, D'Angelo maintained a neutral attitude towards general viewer opinion of the video, stating [...] "With men, if there's any negative reaction, I'm not really going to get an honest feedback ... women love it, most definitely. But for me personally, the response I've got from both men and women has been pretty cool".|$|E

2500|$|Now there's a {{weird thing}} going on. Partly {{proposed}} by {{a colleague of}} mine writing in The Nation, Christopher Hitchens. He is saying, somehow {{he seems to be}} saying, it is wrong to look at history, it is wrong to {{look at the history of}} the past century.

For someone like Hitchens to attack Chomsky, as he's done in The Nation, saying he is somehow 'soft' on fascism because [...] tries to read history is an outrage – an absolute outrage.|$|E
2500|$|Following the budget, and in {{the period}} until the {{spending}} review, Alexander found himself {{at the heart of}} controversial spending decisions made by the government. A series of leaked letters from cabinet ministers showed that the spending review was causing strain within government departments including within the Department of Work and Pensions when a memo from Osborne to Iain Duncan Smith suggested that deep cuts to the welfare budget had already been agreed, prompting accusations by Labour that the cuts were [...] "vicious" [...] and an attack on the poorest in society. In response Alexander said [...] "I am not going to comment on a leaked letter but what I will say is that with welfare spending making up nearly £200 billion, of course it is something <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> {{in the context of the}} spending review." ...|$|E

Sometimes a leading question will draw out a whole line of facts that a man himself would never think of." [...] He went on to put several queries, and it was from Lapham's answers that he generalised the history of his childhood. [...] "Mr. Lapham, {{although he did not}} dwell on his boyish trials and struggles, spoke of them with deep feeling and an abiding sense of their reality." [...] This was what he added in the interview, {{and by the time he}} had got Lapham past the period where risen Americans are all pathetically alike in their narrow circumstances, their sufferings, and their aspirations, he had beguiled him into forgetfulness of the check he had received, and had him talking again in perfect enjoyment of his autobiography.|$|E

Here we have four or five facts, all of which may tell. Here is a bad {{character}} in the village; that is one point. This man had a poaching affray with Mr. Carne's keepers; he killed, or at any rate the coroner's jury found that he killed, one of the keepers. He is engaged to Miss Carne's own maid. This maid is just after this poaching business found insensible in the wood, and tells rather an improbable story as to how it came about. She is the first to enter her mistress's room, and then she has a serious illness. Of course, any girl would be shocked and frightened and upset, but it is not so often that a serious illness would be the result. And lastly, she has been changed ever since. She has, as you remarked to me the other day, an absent, preoccupied sort of way about her. Taken altogether, these things certainly do amount to something." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{whole world}} is {{certainly}} heading for a great simplicity, not deliberately, but rather inevitably. It is not a mere fashion of false innocence, {{like that of the}} French aristocrats before the Revolution, who built an altar to Pan, and who taxed the peasantry for the enormous expenditure which is needed in order to live the simple life of peasants. The simplicity towards which the world is driving is the necessary outcome of all our systems and speculations and of our deep and continuous contemplation of things. For the universe is like everything in it; <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it repeatedly and habitually before we see it. It is only when we have seen it for the hundredth time that we see it for the first time. The more consistently things are contemplated, the more they tend to unify themselves and therefore to simplify themselves. The simplification of anything is always sensational. Thus monotheism is the most sensational of things: it is as if we gazed long at a design full of disconnected objects, and, suddenly, with a stunning thrill, they came together into a huge and staring face.|$|E
