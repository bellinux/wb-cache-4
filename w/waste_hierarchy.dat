40|$|Waste is {{unwanted}} or useless {{materials from}} households, industry, agriculture, hospitals. Waste materials in solid state {{are classified as}} solid waste. Increasing {{of the amount of}} solid waste and the pressure what it has on the environment, impose the need to introduce sustainable solid waste management. Advanced sustainable solid waste management involves several activities at a higher level of final disposal of the <b>waste</b> management <b>hierarchy.</b> Minimal use of material and energy resources contributes to reduce the quantity of generated waste. Reducing of the quantities of solid waste has been achieved by re-use of products for the same or another purpose and by using technologies for material and energy utilization. Technologies for material utilization of solid waste, which are at the third place in <b>waste</b> management <b>hierarchy,</b> are recycling and composting. Technologies for energy utilization of solid waste are divided in two groups: -	Thermochemical processes: insineration, pyrolysis and gasification -	Biochemical processes: anaerobic digestion and landfill gas.

40|$|In {{the light}} of the raft of {{legislation}} introduced by the European Commission since the late 1980 s, waste management planning in the European Union (EU) is currently undergoing tumultuous restructuring. At the heart of this restructuring is the requirement by member states to formulate waste management plans that embrace the Commission’s central concept of the <b>waste</b> management <b>hierarchy.</b> This article begins with the assertion that the grounding of the <b>waste</b> management <b>hierarchy</b> in different European countries reflects members’ ongoing difficulties balancing supra-national environmental regulations with the imperatives of national accumulation strategies. Central to negotiating this tightrope has been a tremendous transformation, modification, re-jigging and re-calibration of the <b>hierarchies</b> of <b>waste</b> management planning institutions in member states. The core argument advanced in this article is that far from being a neutral or technical or practical side show, contemporary (re) scalings of waste management planning in Europe must be approached as being centrally implicated in the constitution of forms of environmental controls that serve rather than burden the interests of leading capitals. This argument is illustrated through a detailed case study of recent scalar inventions in waste management planning in the Republic of Ireland...|$|R
40|$|Summary/Key words 80 SUMMARY Waste {{management}} principles The {{main purpose}} of this thesis is to analyze practical application of legal principles in waste management. This topic was chosen based on the publication of new Waste Framework Directive which newly deals {{with the issue of}} principles in the waste management. Fundamental principles that are being introduced in the Directive are <b>waste</b> management <b>hierarchy,</b> proximity principle, self-sustainability principle, extended polluter responsibility. The thesis is composed of five main chapters, each subdivided into several sections. First chapter introduces reader into the aspects of legal principles and describes basic characteristics of the principles, its function and points out legal theories which have occurred in the past. Introduction chapter also deals with the question of difference between legal regulation and legal principle. Following part of the introducition outlines legal regulation of waste management, as it is initial point for understanding of further sections. The third chapter is devoted to the fundamental principle of waste management, <b>waste</b> management <b>hierarchy.</b> Primarily, the term waste is being described, because it is very problematic to define it correctly and its proper definition highly influences further waste disposal.

50|$|The {{municipal}} solid waste industry has four components: recycling, composting, disposal, and waste-to-energy via incineration. There is no single approach {{that can be applied}} to the management of all waste streams, therefore the Environmental Protection Agency, federal agency of the United States of America, developed a hierarchy ranking strategy for {{municipal solid}} waste. The <b>Waste</b> Management <b>Hierarchy</b> is made up of four levels ordered from most preferred to least preferred methods based on their environmental soundness: Source reduction and reuse; recycling or composting; energy recovery; treatment and disposal.|$|R

40|$|Waste {{generation}} is an unavoidable product of man’s activities, however, sustainable management of such waste {{is a challenge}} faced in many countries today. Nigeria, a developing country in Africa, {{has been in a}} quandary of how to efficiently manage the municipal solid waste its population generates. Many states in the country lack adequate plans and infrastructure required for efficient and sustainable management of municipal solid waste. For Lagos, the most populous and popular state in Nigeria, the problem is further compounded by its rather large and still increasing population. In this research, Lagos is taken as a case study; the extant trend for solid waste handling in households, trends in the formal and informal sector as regards solid waste management from household collection to final disposal are focused upon. Many countries, particularly the developed ones, have employed options in the <b>waste</b> management <b>hierarchy</b> for sustainable management of their municipal solid waste and the blend of options employed is usually highly dependent on local factors. Following the <b>waste</b> management <b>hierarchy,</b> possible options for sustainable municipal solid waste management in Lagos are discussed. It is concluded that waste reduction, reuse, recycling and composting are potential management options for the state. Landfilling will remain an important option for final disposal but reliance on this method could be significantly reduced if management options are exploited to the maximum in a sustainable solid waste management structure. ...|$|R
40|$|Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is an {{unavoidable}} by-product of modern societies {{production and consumption}} patterns. Envisaging waste management strategies is a complex and challenging task, influenced by technical site-specific aspects. To achieve more informed decisions, technical experts should avoid streamlined and generalized analyses, {{while at the same}} time policy-makers should increasingly rely on LCA and other biophysical assessment approaches, which can help them identifying context-specific <b>waste</b> <b>hierarchies</b> and priorities. This paper uses site-specific data in comparing different waste management routes for the Metropolitan City of Naples. The waste management of the Metropolitan City of Naples (3 million people, Campania Region, Southern Italy) in the year 2012 is investigated as a case-study, after having faced a severe waste production and disposal crisis, that has not been totally resolved yet. An extensive collection of primary data is carried out to describe the main input/output flows associated with the treatment and recovery of each single waste fraction (Mixed Municipal Solid Waste – MMSW, Organic Fraction Municipal Solid Waste – OFMSW, Recyclable Fraction Municipal Solid Waste – RFMSW). LCA results reveal that the main burdens are caused by the treatment of MMSW (i. e. mechanical biological treatment, landfill, waste-to-energy) and by the export/transport of the OFMSW outside the region (due to the lack of local treatment plants), almost in all analyzed impact categories. The identification of the weak points along the waste management chain allows a sensitivity analysis to test the influence of potential improvements by means of a scenario analysis. Six strategies, substantially differing in terms of percentage of separate collection, transportation routes and options for the disposal of residual waste, are designed and analyzed. The achieved results point out that it is possible to improve the environmental efficiency of the waste management chain locally, in so strengthening the entire waste management process. This study confirms that LCA, if carefully conducted, allows the identification of criticalities and improvement potential towards new management strategies. The use of site-specific data of full-scale waste treatment facilities and the definition of alternative <b>waste</b> management <b>hierarchies</b> may help decision-making by local public administrators and stakeholders, providing a transparent picture and deep understanding of costs and benefits for waste management at local scale...|$|R
