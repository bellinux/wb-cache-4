40|$|AbstractThe brain plays a {{critical}} yet incompletely understood role in regulating organismal fat. We performed a neuronal silencing screen in Drosophila larvae to identify brain regions {{required to maintain}} proper levels of organismal fat. When used to modulate synaptic activity in specific brain regions, the enhancer-trap driver line E 347 elevated fat upon neuronal silencing, and decreased fat upon neuronal activation. Unbiased sequencing revealed that Arc 1 mRNA levels increase upon E 347 activation. We had previously identified Arc 1 mutations in a high-fat screen. Here we reveal metabolic changes in Arc 1 mutants consistent with a high-fat phenotype and an overall shift toward energy storage. We find that Arc 1 -expressing cells neighbor E 347 neurons, and manipulating E 347 synaptic activity alters Arc 1 expression patterns. Elevating Arc 1 expression in these cells decreased fat, a phenocopy of E 347 activation. Finally, loss of Arc 1 prevented the lean phenotype caused by E 347 activation, suggesting that Arc 1 activity is required for E 347 control of body fat. Importantly, neither E 347 nor Arc 1 manipulation altered energy-related behaviors. Our results support a model <b>wherein</b> <b>E</b> 347 neurons induce Arc 1 in specific neighboring cells to prevent excess fat accumulation...|$|E

In IL- 7 receptor alpha (IL- 7 Rα) knockout mice, B cell development is blocked before B-lineage commitment at the prepro-B cell stage in adult animals. In IL- 7 Rα−/− prepro-B cells, E 47 is expressed and yet is insufficient to transcriptionally activate the putative downstream target gene, Ebf 1. In this study, we show that further increases of E 47 expression in IL- 7 Rα−/− prepro-B cells fails to activate Ebf 1, but rather leads to a dramatic induction of the E 2 A inhibitory factors, Id 2 and Id 3. In contrast, enforced expression of Ebf 1 in IL- 7 Rα−/− bone marrow potently down-regulates Id 2 and Id 3 mRNA expression and restores B cell differentiation in vivo. Down-regulation of both Id 2 and Id 3 during B cell specification is essential in that overexpression of either Id 2 or Id 3 in wild-type bone marrow blocks B cell specification at the prepro-B cell stage.

Our results show that the IMF clock angle dependence of V PC is closely approximated by the function f() = sin 2 (/ 2), which we use in the derivation of a solar wind transfer function E* = E SW f(), <b>wherein</b> <b>E</b> SW is the solar wind electric field. We find that V PC is strongly related to E*, increasing almost linearly with small E* but saturating as E* becomes high.

V PC, on the other hand, is only weakly related to M MS and, for lower, more usual values of E*, actually shows a modest increase with increasing M MS. This result has implications for the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction at the outer planets where the Mach number is typically much higher than it is at 1 AU.

RV nonstructural protein 4 (NSP 4), the first characterized viral enterotoxin, is a 28 -kDa glycoprotein that has pleiotropic functions in RV infection and pathogenesis. NSP 4 has multiple forms enabling it to perform its different functions. Dissecting such functions could be facilitated by use of epitope-specific antibodies. This work mapped the epitopes for the monoclonal antibody B 4 - 2 / 55 and three polyclonal antisera generated against synthetic SA 11 NSP 4 peptides corresponding to residues 114 – 135, 120 – 147, and 150 – 175. The epitope for B 4 - 2 / 55 mapped to residues 100 – 118, <b>wherein</b> residues <b>E</b> 105, R 108 and E 111 are critical for antibody binding. Antiserum generated to two peptides (aa 114 – 135 and aa 120 – 147) with enterotoxin activity each recognize a single but distinct epitope. The epitope for the peptide antiserum to aa 114 – 135 was mapped to residues 114 – 125 with highly conserved residues T 117 /T 118, E 120, and E 122 being critical for antibody binding. The peptide antiserum to aa 120 – 147 binds to NSP 4 at residues 130 – 140 and residues Q 137 –T 138 are critical for this epitope. Finally, the epitope for the antiserum to peptide aa 150 – 175 mapped to residues 155 – 170, <b>wherein</b> residues <b>E</b> 160 and E 170 are critical for antibody binding. Knowledge of the binding sites of domain-specific antibodies can aid in further characterizing different functions of NSP 4.

However, its infectivity is highly dependent on the expression level of coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor (CAR) {{on the surface of}} tumor cells. We engineered Ad 5 virus with the protein transduction domain (PTD) from the HIV- 1 Tat protein (Tat-PTD) inserted in the hypervariable region 5 (HVR 5) of the hexon protein in the virus capsid. Tat-PTD-modified Ad 5 shows a dramatically increased transduction level of CAR-negative cells and bypassed fiber-mediated transduction. It also overcomes the fiber-masking problem, which is caused by release of excess fiber proteins from infected cells. To achieve specific viral replication in neuroblastoma and neuroendocrine tumor cells, we identified the secretogranin III (SCG 3) promoter and constructed an adenovirus Ad 5 PTD(ASH 1 -SCG 3 -E 1 A) <b>wherein</b> <b>E</b> 1 A gene expression is controlled by the SCG 3 promoter and the achaete-scute complex homolog 1 (ASH 1) enhancer. This virus shows selective and efficient killing of neuroblastoma cell lines in vitro, and delays human neuroblastoma xenograft tumor growth on nude mice. To further enhance the viral oncolytic efficacy, we also switched the fiber 5 to fiber 35 to generate Ad 5 PTDf 35. This vector shows dramatically increased transduction capacity of primary human cell cultures including hematopoietic cells and their derivatives, pancreatic islets and exocrine cells, mesenchymal stem cells and primary tumor cells including primary cancer initiating cells. Ad 5 PTDf 35 -based adenovirus could be a useful platform for gene delivery and oncolytic virus development. Viral oncolysis alone cannot completely eradicate tumors. Therefore, we further armed the Ad 5 PTDf 35 -D 24 virus with a secreted form of Helicobacter pylori Neutrophil Activating Protein (HP-NAP).

The model can account for arbitrary arrival patterns, packet size distributions and number of nodes. Our model gives closed form expressions for obtaining the delay and queue length characteristics and models each node as a discrete time G/G/ 1 queue. The service time distribution for the queues is derived by accounting {{for a number of}} factors including the channel access delay due to the shared medium, impact of packet collisions, the resulting backoffs as well as the packet size distribution. The model is also extended for ongoing proposals under consideration for 802. 11 <b>e</b> <b>wherein</b> a number of packets may be transmitted in a burst once the channel is accessed. Our analytical results are verified through extensive simulations. The results of our model can also be used for providing probabilistic quality of service guarantees and determining the number of nodes that can be accommodated while satisfying a given delay constraint.

40|$|In {{large scale}} {{distributed}} storage systems (DSS) deployed in cloud computing, correlated failures resulting in simultaneous failure (or, unavailability) of blocks of nodes are common. In such scenarios, the stored data or a {{content of a}} failed node can only be reconstructed from the available live nodes belonging to available blocks. To analyze the resilience of the system against such block failures, this work introduces the framework of Block Failure Resilient (BFR) codes, <b>wherein</b> the data (<b>e.</b> g., file in DSS) can be decoded by reading out from a same number of codeword symbols (nodes) from each available blocks of the underlying codeword. Further, repairable BFR codes are introduced, wherein any codeword symbol in a failed block can be repaired by contacting to remaining blocks in the system. Motivated from regenerating codes, file size bounds for repairable BFR codes are derived, trade-off between per node storage and repair bandwidth is analyzed, and BFR-MSR and BFR-MBR points are derived. Explicit codes achieving these two operating points for a wide set of parameters are constructed by utilizing combinatorial designs, wherein the codewords of the underlying outer codes are distributed to BFR codeword symbols according to projective planes.
