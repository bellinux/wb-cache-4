50|$|The iconoclastic {{dimension}} of Crouching Bitch continued in installations such as Wash Hands, made in Beijing in 2003, and Project Change World: City of Yan’an in 2006, {{but within a}} more social and political context. In Wash Hands, formally conforming to the government-led hygiene campaign against SARS, Ma instigated unease by asking viewers to <b>wash</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> the same bowl of water. Seemingly {{in honor of the}} once politically significant city Yan’an, Project Change World: City of Yan’an was a public service program to highlight, poke fun, and instigate into the universally mocked Chinglish.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: According to the Centers for Disease Control (2002), {{hand washing}} is the simplest, most {{effective}} measure for preventing {{the spread of}} bacteria, pathogens, and viruses. Recent studies by the American Society for Microbiology (2005) indicate that Americans do not wash their hands after {{going to the bathroom}} and before handling or eating food. The study reported here sought to determine the presence of publications encouraging the public to <b>wash</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> two North Carolina counties. Public restrooms located in rest areas, convenience stores, restaurants, and childcare facilities were examined. Findings indicate that literature encouraging hand washing is not present...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of hand hygiene was highlighted {{in the nineteenth}} century during the first trial done by Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis, an obstetrician practicing in Vienna, now known as an early pioneer of antiseptic procedures. He was able to reduce maternal mortality rate in his hospital by 90 % by just applying the protocol of washing hands in chlorinated lime solution before examining the patients. Semmelweis's hypothesis was largely ignored, rejected, or ridiculed. He was dismissed from the hospital for political reasons and harassed by the medical community in Vienna, being eventually forced to move to Budapest. Semmelweis's practice earned widespread acceptance, when Louise Pasteur confirmed the germ theory and Joseph Lister, pioneered antiseptic surgery. Lister practiced and operated using hygienic methods with great success. There are many national and international guidelines which emphasize the practice of hand hygiene in reducing the incidence of hospital acquired infections (HAI). With all the evidence of decreasing the HAIs the practice of hand hygiene compliance should have been a 100 % in all healthcare facilities. However, various studies done in different countries show that the compliance of hand hygiene amongst the healthcare workers is not satisfactory, ranging only  40 to 50 % even in the developed nations. Why Not? Inaccessible hand washing facilities: This {{is one of the major}} factors due to which the compliance to wash hands is compromised. Wearing Gloves: The misconception amongst the healthcare workers that wearing gloves will prevent transmission of germs is another major factor. Scepticism about the value of hand hygiene: CMEs, lectures, demonstrations and evidence based studies on hand hygiene should be kept in top priority to disseminate the knowledge which will reduce the scepticism. Lack of concept of IPAC, motivation and role model: Many healthcare centres do not have IPAC committee; hence the concept of IPAC is not present in these facilities. If a healthcare worker is not motivated to wash hands she/he will never do it. This is a human behaviour. Being a physician: Last but the most important point is: Do the physicians, the leaders in any healthcare facilities practice correct hand hygiene? Yes to Hand Hygiene: Widely accessible hand washing facilities or Alcohol based hand rub. Multifaceted approach to improve the hand hygiene like CME, training, feedback. Financial incentives, praises from the administrative level. Reminders like posters and pamphlets in the workplace to <b>wash</b> <b>hands.</b> <b>In</b> an era of multi-resistant bacteria, it is now time to implement national IPAC guidelines, create IPAC committees in every healthcare facility, and organize more trainings, CMEs and demonstrations to all healthcare workers. If these measures are not taken in time we may have the MDR organisms engulfing our wards which will definitely increase the healthcare cost as well as morbidity and mortality. </ul...|$|E

40|$|University {{students}} may be at increased risk of infection because of {{living and working in}} close proximity to one another. <b>Hand</b> <b>washing</b> is widely considered the most effective method of preventing the spread of infectious illness. Exploring the determinants of <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> is vital to the development of interventions to increase this behaviour. A survey based on Social Norms Theory assessed <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> frequency and perceptions of peer <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> <b>in</b> 255 students at a Scottish University. Participants reported their own <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> frequency and rate, and how often they thought their peers <b>washed</b> their <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> particular circumstances, to determine whether misperceptions around <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> exist <b>in</b> a UK student population, and whether these influence the behaviour of individuals. Gender was found to be a significant determinant of <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> frequency as females reported <b>washing</b> their <b>hands</b> significantly more often than males. Participants also believed they <b>washed</b> their <b>hands</b> significantly more frequently than their peers. Perceived peer <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> frequency was significantly correlated with participants’ own behaviour. This effect was seen <b>in</b> overall <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> and <b>in</b> food, waste and illness-related <b>hand</b> <b>washing.</b> These results suggest perceived social norms around <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> have a consistent and robust association with individual behaviour. An intervention based on Social Norms Theory may, therefore, be effective <b>in</b> increasing <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> <b>in</b> a student population, reducing infection spread and illness rates within this group. Future research might test the effectiveness of a social norms intervention in other settings which carry an increased risk of infection spread, for example schools, hospitals and care homes...|$|R
