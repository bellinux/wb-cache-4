60|$|In {{looking over}} the packages, Mark found <b>white</b> <b>clover</b> <b>seed,</b> and Timothy seed, among other things, in {{sufficient}} quantity to cover most of the mount of the crater. The weather temporarily clearing off, he called to Bob, and they went ashore together, Mark carrying some of the grass seed in a pail, while. Betts followed with a vessel to hold guano. Providing {{a quantity of the}} last from a barrel that had been previously filled with it, and covered to protect it from the rain, they clambered {{up the side of the}} crater. This was the first time either had ascended since the day they finished planting there, and Mark approached his hills with a good deal of freshly-revived interest in their fate. From them he expected very little, having had no loam to mix with the ashes; but, by dwelling so much of late on the subject of tillage, he was not without faint hopes of meeting with some little reward for the pains he had taken. The reader will judge of the rapture then, as well as of the surprise, with which he first saw a hill of melons, already in the fourth leaf. Here, then, was the great problem successfully solved. Vegetation had actually commenced on that hitherto barren mount, and the spot which had lain--how long, Mark knew not, but probably for a thousand years, if not for thousands of years, in its nakedness--was about to be covered with verdure, and blest with fruitfulness. The inert principles which, brought to act together; had produced this sudden change from barrenness to fertility, had probably been near neighbours to each other all that time, but had failed of bringing forth their fruits, for the want of absolute contact. So Mark reasoned, for he nothing doubted that it was Betts's guano that had stimulated the otherwise barren deposit of the volcano, and caused his seed to germinate. The tillage may have aided, as well as the admission of air, light and water; but something more than this, our young gardener fancied, was wanting to success. That something the manure of birds, meliorated and altered by time, had supplied, and lo! the glorious results were before his eyes.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the importance of protein synthesis during germination of <b>white</b> <b>clover</b> (Trifolium repens) and Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis) and to assess the impact of osmopriming on seed germination in the presence of cadmium. Cycloheximide (Cx, 20 and 100 mu M), a translation inhibitor, delayed germination and reduced final germination percentage in both species, although to a higher extent in P. pratensis than in T. repens. This suggests that in <b>white</b> <b>clover,</b> some proteins involved in reserve mobilisation and metabolic activation were already present in mature seeds. Actinomycin-D (Act-D; 20 and 100 mu M) and alpha-amanitin (alpha-Am 20 mu M), both inhibitors of transcription, did not reduce P. pratensis germination, demonstrating that for this species, transcription is not essential for radicle protrusion and that long-lived mRNA are used for initial protein synthesis. In contrast, incised <b>white</b> <b>clover</b> <b>seeds</b> showed delayed germination in presence of alpha-Am, suggesting that expression of some specific genes may help in the first germination steps. Osmopriming (PEG 8, 000 60 %) improved germination of seeds exposed to 100 mu M Cd but the positive effect of this pretreatment was suppressed (T. repens) or drastically mitigated (P. pratensis) when Act-D or Cx were added to the priming medium. Cadmium reduced alpha- and beta-amylase activities in germinating seeds but osmoprimed seeds exhibited higher activities than unprimed seeds. The presence of inhibitors in the priming medium reduced alpha- and beta-amylase activities. These results suggest that the two studied species differed significantly in the mechanisms occurring during early seed germination and that the beneficial effect of priming requires gene expression and protein synthesis...|$|R

Seed yields of white clover are, however, known to vary greatly, and organic yields are often considerably lower than conventional yields. Our aim {{in this study was}} to estimate the roles of pollinators, pests and different yield components for organic and conventional <b>white</b> <b>clover</b> <b>seed</b> yields. We surveyed pollinators (honey bees, bumble bees and solitary bees), reared the main insect pests (Protapion fulvipes Geoffroy and Hypera spp. weevils) from flowers and measured the yield components (inflorescences per area, flowers per inflorescence, seeds per flower and weight per seed) in organic, conventional untreated and conventional insecticide treated plots in 27 <b>white</b> <b>clover</b> <b>seed</b> fields over two years in southernmost Sweden. Unexpectedly, densities of bees other than honey bees were higher in insecticide treated plots compared to organic plots, but pollinator densities were not related to seed set. The lower pollinator visitation in organic plots might have been caused by pest damage to the flowers, as P. fulvipes and Hypera spp. weevils were more common in organic plots than in conventional insecticide treated plots. The abundances of both P. fulvipes and Hypera spp. weevils were negatively related to seed set, with P. fulvipes being most damaging for seed set. Seed yield was considerably lower (42 %) in organic plots compared to conventional insecticide treated plots, and this was driven by a lower (36 %) seed set. Taken together, our results indicate that pollinator densities are not limiting yields in either conventional or organic <b>white</b> <b>clover</b> <b>seed</b> production, whereas P. fulvipes crop damage is an important factor limiting organic yields via negative effects on seed set.

Anti-clover root antiserum {{had a higher}} agglutinating titer with infective strains of R. trifolii than with noninfective strains. The root antiserum previously adsorbed with noninfective R. trifolii cells remained reactive only with infective cells, including infective revertants. When adsorbed with infective cells, the root antiserum was reactive with neither infective nor noninfective cells. Other Rhizobium species incapable of infecting clover did not demonstrate surface antigens cross-reactive with clover. Radioimmunoassay indicated twice as much antigenic cross-reactivity of clover roots and R. trifolii 403 (infective) than R. trifolii Bart A (noninfective). Immunofluorescence with anti-R. trifolii (infective) antiserum was detected on the exposed surface of the root epidermal cells and diminished at the root meristem. The immunofluorescent crossreaction on clover roots was totally removed by adsorption of anti-R. trifolii (infective) antiserum with encapsulated infective cells but not with noninfective cells. The cross-reactive capsular antigens from R. trifolii strains were extracted and purified. The ability of these antigens to induce clover root hair deformation was much greater when they {{were obtained from the}} infective than noninfective strains. The cross-reactive capsular antigen of R. trifolii 403 was characterized as a high-molecular-weight (greater than 4. 6 times 10 (6) daltons), beta-linked, acidic heteropolysaccharide containing 2 -deoxyglucose, galactose, glucose, and glucuronic acid.

40|$|New Zealand {{currently}} supplies approximately 60 % of {{the world}} white clover (Trifolium repens L.) seed market, of which 99 % is produced in the Canterbury growing region. However, this important cash crop may be infested by a range of insect pests which contribute to economic losses. The main aims of the research in this thesis were first, to identify the key economic pests in <b>white</b> <b>clover</b> <b>seed</b> crops by studying the interactions between plant and insect pest phenologies; second, to quantify the effect of selected pests on <b>white</b> <b>clover</b> <b>seed</b> production; third, to determine the most effective timing and placement of insecticide applications for controlling the pests; and fourth, to determine the synchrony of potential natural enemies with key insect pests. Twenty four and fifteen <b>white</b> <b>clover</b> <b>seed</b> crops in the main Canterbury production areas were monitored for insect pests and arthropod predators in two successive growing seasons (1994 - 95 and 1995 - 96, respectively). Suction samples were taken at varying distances from the crop edge into the crop from mid-November until harvest to determine the abundance, spatial and temporal distribution of arthropods. The most abundant pests found in crops were potato mirid (Calocoris norvegicus [Gmelin]) and bluegreen lucerne aphid (Acyrthosiphon kondoi Shinji) which occurred in high numbers during the critical inflorescence formation and developmental stages (up to seed set). Potato mirid were found in higher densities around the crop margin (edge to 4 m into the crop) compared with bluegreen lucerne aphid that were more widely distributed throughout the crop. A field cage experiment was conducted to determine the impact of different potato mirid densities (0, 10, 20, 40 and 80 /cage) and high numbers (200 /plant) of blue green lucerne aphid released at different plant growth stages (first and second inflorescence development, and full flowering) on inflorescence expression, seed production and yield. Loss of inflorescences and increased proportions of damaged inflorescences increased with increasing potato mirid densities and a significant linear relationship between increasing potato mirid density and declining seed yield was established. The highest level of inflorescence damage from bluegreen lucerne aphid feeding occurred at full flower and in a treatment where low infestation numbers (50 /cage) were allowed to build up to 2100 /cage. Significantly lower seed quality (thousand seed weight), but not overall seed yields were recorded from these field cages. The timing and placement (crop edge to 6 m into the crop) of three insecticides (lambdacy! talothrin, fluvalinate and pirimicarb) for the control of potato mirid and blue green lucerne aphid were evaluated in a field experiment. Lambda-cyhalothrin gave the most effective control of potato mirid, while pirimicarb was ineffective against potato mirid, but gave effective bluegreen lucerne aphid control. The earlier (late November) rather than traditional (early December) application of insecticides resulted in {{an extended period of}} control of potato mirid and bluegreen lucerne aphid during inflorescence development and produced higher seed yields compared with later application timings. In a single <b>white</b> <b>clover</b> <b>seed</b> crop an intensive sampling experiment was conducted to study the spatial and temporal distribution of insect pests {{for the development of a}} crop sampling programme. An insecticide spray action threshold of 10 potato mirid nymphs in the crop margin (crop edge to 4 m into the crop) was established, while an action threshold (2 or 4 bluegreen lucerne aphid/inflorescence) for bluegreen lucerne aphid control was developed from other studies in <b>white</b> <b>clover</b> <b>seed</b> crops. Application of insecticides to control potato mirid and bluegreen lucerne aphid numbers exceeding thresholds were economically viable. The synchrony of common natural enemy populations with potato mirid and bluegreen lucerne aphid populations was evaluated using correlation analysis of data collected during the 1994 - 95 Canterbury survey season. Although some natural enemy populations showed synchrony with bluegreen lucerne aphid (e. g., ladybird, Coccinella undecimpunctata L. and lacewing, Micromus tasmaniae [Walker]) and potato mirid nymphs (harvestman, Phalangium opilio L.), they were unable to prevent bluegreen lucerne aphid or potato mirid densities increasing to economic injury levels.

40|$|Abstract The {{research}} project Liberation, {{supported by the}} European Commission under the Environment and Sustainable Development Programme (Fifth RTD Framework Programme) aimed at developing a decision support system for ecological risk assessment of contaminated sites has proposed a tiered system including the triad method. This method integrates contaminant chemistry and bioavailability analyses with observed ecotoxicological effects in soil and groundwater.   In this study the triad method was used to perform a risk characterization of a former surface treatment and metal industry, now used for the student union buildings of the Mälardalen University in Eskilstuna, Sweden. On the site, high concentrations of copper, zinc and nickel have been detected in the soil in a preliminary investigation of contaminant levels with XRF. For performing the risk assessment of the site according to the triad method, contaminant bioavailability, soil metal concentrations and soil toxicity were determined and an ecological assessment was carried out on four selected soil samples (one reference soil and three samples with low (B), medium (C) and high (D) contaminant levels). Contaminant bioavailability was measured through leaching (ISO TC 190 /S 7) and biouptake tests (DGT). Metal concentrations in soil samples (acid digestion) and soil leachates were determined by ICP-MS. Ecotoxicity of the soil samples was measured in luminescent bacterial assays, whole soil direct-contact tests with a meiobenthic ostracod and growth inhibition tests using radish and <b>white</b> <b>clover</b> <b>seeds.</b> The assessment of the ecological status of the soil samples was performed by determination of microorganism C-mineralization, nitrification rates and a nematode inventory.   The integrated results, according to the triad method showed an environmental risk for all soil samples; B = 0. 79, C = 0. 62, D = 0. 90 with deviation B = 0. 31, C = 0. 68, D = 0. 18.  The high deviation of the soil samples B and C indicate an uncertainty in the assessment.  For firm conclusions concerning if a remediation is necessary, more analysis should be performed. Soil sample D showed that the environmental risk {{is a direct result}} of the pollution degree.  A clean-up is motivated at this point. The methodology described in this report is considered a possible starting point for carrying out improved environmental risk assessments.  This is the aim of achieving sustainable remediation that is more favorable from an environmental and socio-economic perspective. ...|$|R

Greenhouse and field studies were conducted to evaluate small broomrape response to common crop and weed species in the Pacific Northwest. Host species in the greenhouse or field study included alfalfa, arrowleaf clover, carrot, celery, common vetch, crimson clover, lettuce, prickly lettuce, red clover, spotted catsear, subterranean <b>clover,</b> <b>white</b> <b>clover,</b> and wild carrot. False-host species included barley, birdsfoot trefoil, creeping bentgrass, cucumber, field corn, fine fescue, flax, Italian ryegrass, nasturtium, oat, orchardgrass, perennial ryegrass, snap bean, sugar pea, sunflower, sweet corn, tall fescue, tomato, and wheat. Non-host species included sugar beet and curly dock. The greenhouse polyethylene bag system provided a rapid and inexpensive screening for plant species host status to small broomrape.

In thirty-six fields from different regions, density of flower heads and their area, and weevils {{of the genera}} Apion and Hypera, hatching from flower heads, were assessed. In fifteen of these fields, additional measurements were made in order to calculate potential yield and yieldreducing factors. Flower heads had a mean of ninetytwo florets per head, of which proportionately 0, 59 were intact, 0, 08 were not pollinated and 0, 34 damaged by weevils; 0, 16 of the florets contained larvae of Apion species. In intact florets {{the mean number of}} seeds was 3, 6. Density and size of flower heads were correlated with low density of flower heads leading to significantly more florets per head. The number of seeds per intact floret was correlated with the proportion of unpollinated florets. The number of insect-damaged florets was influenced by both larvae of Apion in and the numbers of Hypera nigrirostris (Fabr.) hatched from flower heads. One larva of H. nigrirostris caused approximately ten times the damage of a larva of Apion. Densities of Apion and Hypera were influenced by location, with fields with adjacent weevil sources being most at risk.

Non-irrigated controls were also maintained. In red clover, increased plant water stress reduced the duration of the season-long bud and flower production, stem length, potential floral capacity (PFC), and seed yield (SY). Root rot index (RRI) increased with increasing levels of plant water stress, indicating that supplemental water applications reduced second-year root rot severity. The reduction in SY from increasing plant water stress was primarily caused by a decrease in floral fertility, and less conclusively by reductions in inflorescence number per unit area.

Use of seed priming with Spd improved seed germination percentage, germination vigor, germination index, root viability and length, and shortened mean germination time under different water stress conditions. Seedling fresh weight and dry weight also increased significantly in Spd-treated seeds compared with control (seeds primed with distilled water). Improved starch metabolism was considered a possible reason for this seed invigoration, since seeds primed with Spd had significantly increased α-amylase/β-amylase activities, reducing sugar, fructose and glucose content and transcript level of β-amylase gene but not transcript level of α-amylase gene. In addition, the physiological effects of exogenous Spd on improving seeds’ tolerance to water deficit during germination were reflected by lower lipid peroxidation levels, better cell membrane stability and significant higher seed vigour index in seedlings. Enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, catalase and ascorbate peroxidase), ascorbate-glutathione cycle (ASC-GSH cycle) and transcript level of genes encoding antioxidant enzymes induced by exogenous Spd {{may be one of the}} critical reasons behind acquired drought tolerance through scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in water-stressed white clover seeds.

40|$|In {{conventional}} {{seed production}} of grasses and clover it is recognised that a low plant density in the seed crop stimulates the reproductive development and hence increase seed yield. Most temperate forage species of grasses and <b>white</b> <b>clover</b> establish slowly {{and have a}} relatively poor ground cover, which limits the competition against weeds. In order to optimise quality and yield in organic grass and <b>clover</b> <b>seed</b> production alternative establishment methods have been identified. These methods enhance crop competitiveness against weeds and allow for mechanical weed control. Establishing the under sown seed crop right between the cereal cover crop row provides a higher ground cover, and the establishment rate of the seed crop is enhanced.

The three cultivars were either sown without a cover-crop or sown under a cover-crop of spring barley (cv. Crescent) or peas (cv. Countess). The {{effects of these}} methods of establishment on the stolon growth and components of seed yield were subsequently measured. Stolon growth and development was influenced by row spacing, cultivar and season. The overall plant response at all but the widest row spacing (60 cm) was to increase stolon growth such that inflorescence production, the number and proportion of ripe inflorescences and the other seed yield components were unaffected by row spacing. Cultivars differed in their response to row spacing. Cultivar Olwen produced most inflorescences and more ripe inflorescences when broadcast, cv. S 184 when sown at 60 cm row spacing and cv. Menna at 15 or 30 cm row spacing. Cultivars also differed in their response to cover-crop, with cvs Menna and S 184 producing more inflorescences and more ripe inflorescences when sown under barley and peas than when pure sown.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{is described in}} which the effects of different spring managements on the potential seed yield and seed yield components of three white clover cultivars of contrasting leaf types were assessed. Cv. S 184, the small-leaved variety, produced more but smaller inflorescences than CVS Olwen, a large-leaved variety, or Menna, a medium-leaved variety. However, cv. Olwen, produced inflorescences with more florets, seeds per inflorescence and a higher seed yield per ten inflorescences than the other cultivars. Both potential seed yield and the individual yield components were influenced by management. Cv. Olwen produced more inflorescences and a higher potential seed yield under a cutting system than under grazing systems, which reduced the number {{and size of the}} inflorescences. Cvs S 184 and Menna were less influenced by management system and performed similarly under cutting and grazing. The highly significant relationship between the number of ripe inflorescences and potential seed yield showed clearly that high seed yields are only achieved if the crop is harvested when the number of ripe inflorescences is at a maximum. The relatively short duration of the period of maximum ripe inflorescences emphasized the importance of determining the correct harvesting date, although weather conditions also play an important part in deciding when to harvest. Florets per inflorescence, seed set and 1000 seed weight remained relatively constant over the harvest period, and were not influenced by harvest date.

40|$|Three {{contrasting}} {{white clover}} varieties, Olwen (large-leaved), Menna (medium-leaved) and S 184 (small-leaved) were sown {{with and without}} a grass companion in 30 cm drills. Two grazing and one mechanical spring defoliation managements were imposed. Counts {{of the total number}} of inflorescences and of the percentage in various ripeness categories were made throughout the period of seed crop development to determine the pattern of inflorescence development and optimum harvest date. Inflorescence numbers were greatest in cv. S 184 and least in cv. Olwen and, in general, varieties produced both more inflorescences and a greater proportion of ripe inflorescences when grown under spring defoliation managements similar to those for which they were bred. Thus, cv. Olwen produced more ripe inflorescences, and a lower proportion of brown inflorescences (semi-ripe), after mechanical defoliation while cv. Menna produced more ripe inflorescences following mechanical defoliation and rotational grazing. However, cv. S 184 produced more ripe inflorescences under both grazing managements than under mechanical defoliation. Optimum harvest date was not affected by management or variety, total inflorescence number and maximum ripe inflorescences having reached a peak on 11 September. However, varieties differed in the proportion of ripe and brown (semi-ripe) inflorescences on this date, with cv. Menna and cv. S 184 containing a significantly higher proportion of brown inflorescences than cv.

(b) the seed yield losses incurred by different intensities of potato mirid (PM, Calocoris norvegicus) released in 0. 81 m² field cages (Cage Experiment). (c) the economic impact and effects on arthropod numbers from the application of two recommended insecticides (flu valin ate and dichlorvos), applied at the traditional timing for clover casebearer moth (Coleophora spissicornis and C. frischella) control (Spray Experiment). Of the insect pests collected in the survey experiment, PM, blue-green lucerne aphid (BGLA, Acyrthosiphon kondoi), and brown shield bug (BSB, Dictyotus caenosus) were the most prevalent and most likely to cause economic injury to the developing flower heads and reductions in seed yields. PM nymphs and BGLA numbers peaked in mid-November (survey experiment), while BGLA numbers peaked in mid-January (spray experiment). BSB numbers occurred {{later in the season}} coinciding with the end of flowering and seed set in mid-January through to harvest (early February). In the cage experiment the level of PM injury was highest on the stolon's second flower head and resulted in seed yield losses equivalent in value to $ 348 / ha at the PM (equivalent to 14 18 PM/m²). In the spray experiment fluvalinate controlled insect pest numbers for a longer period compared to dichlorvos.

[...] Symbiotic nitrogen fixation (up to 545 kg N per hectare per year, although usually much less, e.g. about 110 to 170 kg N per hectare per year) in root nodules of <b>white</b> <b>clover</b> obviates synthetic nitrogen fertilizer use for maintaining productivity on much temperate zone pasture land. <b>White</b> <b>clover</b> is commonly grown in mixtures with forage grasses, e.g. perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne), [...] Such mixtures can not only optimize livestock production, but can also reduce the bloat risk to livestock that can be associated with excessive <b>white</b> <b>clover</b> in pastures. Such species mixtures also tend to avoid issues that could otherwise be associated with cyanogenic glycoside (linamarin and lotaustralin) intake on pure or nearly pure stands of some <b>white</b> <b>clover</b> varieties. However, problems do not inevitably arise with grazing on monocultures of <b>white</b> <b>clover,</b> and superior ruminant production is sometimes achieved on <b>white</b> <b>clover</b> monocultures managed to optimize sward height.

40|$|A low {{occurrence}} of <b>white</b> <b>clover</b> in pastures contributes to soil nitrogen (N) deficiency {{and a low}} quality feed for stock. There is {{evidence to suggest that}} competition for soil phosphorus (P) from roots of browntop {{plays an important role in}} determining the distribution of <b>white</b> <b>clover</b> in hill country swards. However, competition for soil P between roots of browntop and <b>white</b> <b>clover</b> has not been studied separately from other factors known to affect the growth and persistence of <b>white</b> <b>clover</b> (e. g., soil moisture, grazing management, shoot interferences (shading and physical impedance), and non-competitive root interferences). In hill country pastures, P level (phosphorus fertilisers), and defoliation (grazing management), are the main factors that can be changed by farmers to alter pasture botanical composition. The high cost of superphosphate has limited the potential of farmers to manipulate pastures using fertiliser applications. Therefore, it is important to know whether roots of browntop compete with roots of <b>white</b> <b>clover</b> for soil P, and whether a low supply of soil P will contribute to more severe competition from browntop roots. The possibility of non-competitive interferences occurring between roots of browntop and <b>white</b> <b>clover</b> must also be considered. How defoliation alters the balance of P acquisition between roots of browntop and <b>white</b> <b>clover</b> needs to be determined. Three techniques were employed to examine the nature of root interferences occurring between browntop and white clover: plant strategies; dual P isotope labelling; and a more traditional competitive settings trial using aerial partitions. Plant growth and root interferences were studied at a range of levels of soil P supply. Responses of growth and phosphorus uptake of browntop and <b>white</b> <b>clover</b> to increasing soil P supply were examined first, in the glasshouse, by growing monocultures of browntop and <b>white</b> <b>clover</b> in pots. Two mini-sward trials (one at deficient soil P supply, the other at adequate to luxury soil P supply) were carried out in the glasshouse to allow examination of root interactions (without shoot interactions). The basis of the experimental design was to determine the relative amounts of phosphorus- 32 and - 33 absorbed by a central row of plants (either browntop or <b>white</b> <b>clover)</b> from two adjacent soil spaces, one dominated by <b>white</b> <b>clover</b> roots, the other by browntop roots. 32 P was injected into the soil on one side of the central row of plants, and 33 P into the other side. 32 p and 33 p uptake was assessed by harvesting the shoots of the central plants, and counting the two isotopes. The competitive settings type trial compared the growth and P uptake of a single central plant in a small pot (no interference with other plants) with a central plant in a larger pot grown with roots associated with roots of plants of the same species (intraspecific association), or of the other species (interspecific association). Shoots of the central plant was separated from the shoots of outer plants by an aerial partition. The growth of browntop and <b>white</b> <b>clover,</b> and the nature of root interferences occurring within and between the two species was dependent on the level of soil P supply. However, the higher root density and specific root length (SRL) of browntop compared with <b>white</b> <b>clover</b> appeared to be the most important factor determining the success of browntop at all levels of soil P supply, regardless of whether or not browntop was grown with <b>white</b> <b>clover.</b> According to the plant strategy theory of Grime, browntop was found to be a stress tolerant plant. At low levels of P supply, the lower growth rate of browntop compared with <b>white</b> <b>clover</b> would be an important factor contributing to the dominance of browntop in hill country pastures. At adequate to luxury levels of soil P supply, shoot growth of browntop was more responsive than <b>white</b> <b>clover,</b> and browntop was capable of luxury consumption of P. The high growth rate and large demand for P contributed to the competitiveness of browntop at high P supply. However, the lower demand for P by <b>white</b> <b>clover,</b> and the high P supply may have enabled <b>white</b> <b>clover</b> to avoid competition with browntop. On unamended subsoil, browntop reduced P acquisition by <b>white</b> <b>clover</b> roots, and had a greater P uptake in the presence of roots of <b>white</b> <b>clover</b> than with roots of other browntop plants. Therefore, evidence of root competition for soil P from browntop with <b>white</b> <b>clover</b> was found. The competitive effect of browntop appeared to be due to browntop decreasing the availability of P in the soil, explained by browntop's ability to acquire more radioactive P from the soil than <b>white</b> <b>clover.</b> At low P supply (subsoil), P application, but not defoliation of browntop, reduced the competitiveness of browntop. At adequate P supply, the ability of browntop to acquire P was reduced by defoliation. The effect of defoliation was rapid (four days), and browntop was able to acquire P isotope to higher concentrations in the shoots than when undefoliated. Possibly the reduction of root competitiveness of browntop may be short-lived. Some interference, other than root competition, was occurring at intermediate to luxury levels of soil P supply, and may have masked the competitive effects of browntop. <b>White</b> <b>clover</b> appeared to benefit for P acquisition from growing with browntop, due to greater local root density compared with when growing with other <b>white</b> <b>clover</b> plants. Therefore, browntop and <b>white</b> <b>clover</b> appeared to gain mutual benefit for P acquisition from the presence of roots of the other species, and the competitive effects of browntop were not of overriding importance. The possibility of autotoxicity of <b>white</b> <b>clover</b> on its own root growth was discussed in relation to rhizosphere acidity effects on the toxicity of phenolics. At adequate to luxury levels of soil P supply, neither undefoliated browntop nor undefoliated <b>white</b> <b>clover</b> benefited from defoliation of adjacently growing <b>white</b> <b>clover</b> plants. However, at lower P supply, defoliation of <b>white</b> <b>clover</b> led to an increased P isotope acquisition by nearby browntop plants. Therefore, defoliation reduced the demand for soil P by <b>white</b> <b>clover.</b> Roots of browntop were not as tolerant of defoliation as <b>white</b> <b>clover.</b> In the field, the mat forming behaviour of browntop, physically impeding the growth of <b>white</b> <b>clover</b> and shading <b>white</b> <b>clover</b> stolons, would reduce the severity of competition for soil P between roots of browntop and <b>white</b> <b>clover.</b> Overall, root competition for P from browntop with <b>white</b> <b>clover</b> was found not to be as important as previously thought. The use of several experimental techniques allowed a clearer picture of the interferences that occur between browntop and <b>white</b> <b>clover</b> to be obtained. The nature of root interference changed with increasing P supply. The responses of browntop and <b>white</b> <b>clover</b> to increasing P supply was found to be enlightening when the plant strategy theory of Grime was used to compare browntop and <b>white</b> <b>clover.</b> However, the dual P isotope technique found plant interferences that were not detected by the other methods used (P response and competitive settings trial), and allowed interferences that were occurring simultaneously to be elucidated...|$|R
