2500|$|Technology writer Dan Gillmor, {{writing in}} Salon, said: [...] "The case also {{reminds us that}} civil {{lawsuits}} {{play a vital role}} in our society.... sometimes, as in this case, they are the last line of defense when powerful institutions beat up on individuals. <b>We</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> at our peril." ...|$|E
2500|$|The poet Fernando Demaría in {{an essay}} [...] "Xul Solar y Paul Klee" [...] (published in the Argentine {{magazine}} Lyra, 1971, and quoted extensively at [...] ), wrote, [...] "It is not easy for the human spirit to elevate itself from astrology to astronomy, but we would be making a mistake if <b>we</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> an authentic astrologer, like Xul Solar, {{is close to the}} source of the stars... The primitivism of Xul Solar is anterior to the appearance of the Gods. The Gods correspond to a more evolved form of energy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sociologist Susie Scott {{challenged}} the interpretation {{and treatment of}} shyness as being pathological. [...] "By treating shyness as an individual pathology, ... <b>we</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> {{this is also a}} socially oriented state of mind that is socially produced and managed." [...] She explores the idea that [...] "shyness is a form of deviance: a problem for society as much as for the individual", and concludes that, to some extent, [...] "we are all impostors, faking our way through social life". One of her interview subjects (self-defined as shy) puts this point of view even more strongly: [...] "Sometimes I want to take my cue from the militant disabled lobbyists and say, 'hey, it's not MY problem, it's society's'. I want to be proud to be shy: on the whole, shys are probably more sensitive, and nicer people, than 'normals'. I shouldn't have to change: society should adapt to meet my needs." ...|$|E

However, haven’t <b>we</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>that</b> part of architectural design is beauty? What does beauty mean in eco-design? It seems that contemporary fashion is really compatible with green ideas. Do we need a new vision for green beauty...|$|R

40|$|Some {{time in our}} past, {{we humans}} stopped {{listening}} to what the forest tells us and no longer paid heed to the wisdom of nature. <b>We</b> <b>forgot</b> <b>that</b> life is lim-ited, and that the might of each individual is also limited. The 2006 opening film told {{the stories of the}} wisdom of nature and the forests which were the cradle of living creatures in their pursuit of eternity. 24...|$|R
2500|$|Bjelke-Petersen died in St Aubyn's Hospital in Kingaroy in April 2005, aged 94, {{with his}} wife and family members by his side. He {{received}} a State Funeral, held in Kingaroy Town Hall, at which the then Prime Minister, John Howard, and Queensland Premier, Peter Beattie were speakers. Beattie, who had been sued by Bjelke-Petersen for defamation and was arrested during the 1971 Springbok tour protests, said: [...] "I think too often in the adversarial nature of politics <b>we</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> behind every leader, behind every politician, is indeed a family and we shouldn't forget that." [...] As the funeral was taking place in Kingaroy, about 200 protesters gathered in Brisbane to [...] "ensure that those who suffered under successive Bjelke-Petersen governments were not forgotten". Protest organiser Drew Hutton said [...] "Queenslanders should remember what is described as a dark passage in the state's history." [...] Bjelke-Petersen was buried [...] "beside his trees that he planted and he nurtured and they grew" [...] at the family property [...] "Bethany" [...] at Kingaroy.|$|E

60|$|How {{good that}} dinner was! Hot biscuit, chicken, shortcake, coffee {{and the most}} delicious butter and cream. At the moment it did seem a most {{satisfactory}} way to live. <b>We</b> <b>forgot</b> <b>that</b> the dishes had to be washed three times each day, and that the mud and rain and wind and snow often shut the homestead in {{for weeks at a}} stretch. Seeing the valley at its loveliest, under the glamor of a summer afternoon, we found it perfect.|$|R

60|$|And so shall we. If <b>we</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> God is {{the living}} God, who brought our forefathers into this land; who has {{revealed}} {{to us the}} wealth of it step by step, as we needed it; who is helping and blessing us now, every day and all the year round--then we shall begin worshipping other gods.|$|E
6000|$|... "The wager, Sire," [...] said I, [...] "is {{one that}} I take shame in having entered upon; that shame made me eager to pay it, {{although}} fully conscious that I had not lost. But even now, I cannot, in any case, accept the forfeit Chatellerault {{was willing to}} suffer. Shall we--shall <b>we</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> the wager was ever laid?" ...|$|E
60|$|Eleventh, Would Jesus Christ {{have mercy}} offered, {{in the first}} place, to the biggest sinners? Then let God's ministers tell them so. There is an incidence36 in us, I know not how it doth come about, when we are converted, to contemn them that are left behind. Poor fools as we are, <b>we</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> we {{ourselves}} were so (Titus 3:2,3).|$|E

5000|$|... "On this day, so full for Americans of {{thoughts}} connected with their National Independence, <b>we</b> may not <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> Americans have yet other grounds for gratitude {{to the people}} of the Netherlands. <b>We</b> cannot <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> our flag received its first foreign salute from a Dutch officer, nor that the Province of Friesland gave to our independence its first formal recognition. By way of Leyden and Delft-Haven and Plymouth Rock, and again by way of New Amsterdam, the free public school reached American shores.|$|R
60|$|But he {{had learned}} something, which was more than I had done. Later in the afternoon, he {{deliberately}} launched out from shore on the log. Still later he persuaded me to join him, and I, too, learned the trick of paddling. For {{the next several days}} we could not tear ourselves away from the slough. So absorbed were we in our new game that we almost neglected to eat. We even roosted in a nearby tree at night. And <b>we</b> <b>forgot</b> <b>that</b> Red-Eye existed.|$|R
60|$|Free {{speech is}} an idea which has at present all the unpopularity of a truism; so that we tend to forget {{that it was not}} so very long ago that it had the more {{practical}} unpopularity which attaches to a new truth. Ingratitude is surely the chief of the intellectual sins of man. He takes his political benefits for granted, just as he takes the skies and the seasons for granted. He considers the calm of a city street a thing as inevitable as the calm of a forest clearing, whereas it is only kept in peace by a sustained stretch and effort similar to that which keeps up a battle or a fencing match. Just as we forget where we stand in relation to natural phenomena, so we forget it in relation to social phenomena. <b>We</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> the earth is a star, and <b>we</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> free speech is a paradox.|$|E
6000|$|Of {{such times}} we here in England {{have had no}} experience, and we forget how common they are; <b>we</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> many great nations {{have been in this}} state again and again. <b>We</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> almost all Europe was in that wild and lawless state in our fathers' times, and {{therefore}} <b>we</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> the Bible, which tells man his whole duty, must needs tell men about such times as those, and how a man may do his duty, and save his soul therein. For the Bible is every man's book, and has its lesson for every man. It is meant not merely for comfortable English folk, who sit at home at ease, under just laws and a good government. It is meant just as much for the opprest, for the persecuted, for the man who is fighting for his country, for the man who has been found fighting in vain, and is simply waiting for God's help, and crying, [...] "Lord, how long? how long ere Thou avenge the blood that is shed?" [...] It is meant as much for such as for you and me; that every man, in whatever fearful times he may live, and whatever fearful trials he may go through, and whatever fearful things he may be tempted to do, and, indeed, may have to do, in self-defence, may still {{be able to go to}} the Bible, there to find light for his feet, and a lantern for his path, and so that he may steer through the worst of times by Faith in the Living God.|$|E
60|$|The {{mother and}} {{daughter}} talked a long while with Mr. Wigglesworth about a suitable epitaph, and finally chose an ordinary verse of ill-matched rhymes which had already been inscribed upon innumerable tombstones. But when we ridicule the triteness of monumental verses, <b>we</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> Sorrow reads far deeper in them than we can, and finds a profound and individual purport in what seems so vague and inexpressive unless interpreted by her. She makes the epitaph anew, though the selfsame words may have served for a thousand graves.|$|E

6000|$|As soon as {{they were}} gone, and Charles had {{recovered}} breath sufficiently to listen to rational conversation, I ventured to observe, [...] "This comes of being too sure! We made one mistake. We took it for granted that because a man wears a wig, he must be an impostor--which does not necessarily follow. <b>We</b> <b>forgot</b> <b>that</b> not Colonel Clays alone have false coverings to their heads, and that wigs may sometimes be worn from motives of pure personal vanity. In fact, we were again the slaves of preconceptions." ...|$|R
60|$|So far we {{have been}} praying to our Heavenly Father, first as a Father, then as a King, then as an Inspirer, then as a Giver; and next we pray to Him as a Forgiver--'Forgive us our trespasses.' We have been confessing in these four {{petitions}} what God's goodwill to man is; what God wishes man to be, how man ought to live and believe. And then comes the recollection of sin. We must confess what God's law is before we can confess that we have broken it; and now we do confess that we have broken it. We know that God is our Father. How often have <b>we</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>that</b> He is a father; how often have <b>we</b> <b>forgotten</b> to be good fathers ourselves.|$|R
60|$|Those kisses {{were like}} wine to me, {{for it is}} strange how, if we love her, by the decree of Nature {{the touch of a}} {{beautiful}} woman's lips, felt for the first time, affects us in our youth. Whatever else <b>we</b> <b>forget,</b> <b>that</b> we always remember, however false those lips afterwards be proved. For then the wax is soft and the die sinks deep, so deep that no after-heats can melt its stamp and no fretting wear it out while we live beneath the sun.|$|E
60|$|When {{all things}} {{go on in}} a common-place way with us--that is, in this well-made world, comfortably, easily, prosperously--how apt we all are--God forgive us--to forget God. How <b>we</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> on Him we depend for every breath we draw; that Christ is {{guarding}} us daily from a hundred dangers, a hundred sorrows, it may be from a hundred disgraces, of which we, in our own self-satisfied blindness, never dream. How dull our prayers become, and how short. We almost think, at times, {{that there is no}} use in praying, for we get all we want without asking for it, in what we choose to call the course of circumstances and nature.--God forgive us, indeed.|$|E
60|$|In a {{state of}} nature almost every plant {{produces}} seed, and amongst animals {{there are very few}} which do not annually pair. Hence we may confidently assert, that all plants and animals are tending to increase at a geometrical ratio, that all would most rapidly stock every station in which they could any how exist, and that the geometrical tendency to increase must be checked by destruction at some period of life. Our familiarity with the larger domestic animals tends, I think, to mislead us: we see no great destruction falling on them, and <b>we</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> thousands are annually slaughtered for food, and that in {{a state of}} nature an equal number would have somehow to be disposed of.|$|E

60|$|But if {{we carry}} that spirit into religion, and our spiritual and heavenly duties; if <b>we</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> {{that is the}} spirit of the world; if <b>we</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> we renounced the world at our baptism, and that we {{therefore}} promised not to shape our lives by ITS rules and maxims; if our thought is, not of whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, of good report, whatsoever brings us true honour and deserved praise from God and from man; if we think only that intensely selfish and worldly thought, How much will God take for saving my soul?--which is the secret thought (alas that it should be so!) of too many of all denominations,--then we shall be in a fair way of killing our souls; so that if they be saved, they will not at all events be saved alive. For we shall kill in our souls just those instincts of purity, justice, generosity, mercy, love, in one word, of unselfishness and unworldliness, which make the very life of the soul, because they are inspired by the Spirit of God, even the Holy Ghost. And we shall be but too likely not to sit in heavenly places with Christ Jesus--as St. Paul tells us we may do even in this life: but to go to our own place--wherever that may be--with selfish Judas, who when he found that his Saviour was not about to restore the kingdom to Israel, and make a great prince of him there and then, made the best investment he could, under the danger which he saw at hand, by selling his Lord for thirty pieces of silver: to remain to all time a warning to those who are religious for self-interest's sake.|$|E
6000|$|My friends, {{the longer}} I live, the more certain I am {{that the only}} reason for praying at all is because God is our Father; the more certain I am that we shall never have any heart to pray unless we believe that God is our Father. If <b>we</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that,</b> we may utter to Him selfish cries for bread; or when we look at His great power, we may become terrified, and utter selfish cries to Him not to harm us, without any real shame or sorrow for sin: but few of us will have any heart to persevere in those cries. People will say to themselves, 'If God is evil, He will not care to have mercy on me: and if He is good, there is no use wearying Him by asking Him what He has already {{intended}} to give me: why should I pray at all?' ...|$|E
60|$|To {{a spectator}} on the spot, it is {{remarkable}} that the events of Roman history, and Roman life itself, appear not so distant as the Gothic ages which succeeded them. We stand in the Forum, or on the height of the Capitol, and seem to see the Roman epoch close at hand. <b>We</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> a chasm extends between it and ourselves, in which lie all those dark, rude, unlettered centuries, around the birth-time of Christianity, as well as the age of chivalry and romance, the feudal system, and the infancy of a better civilization than that of Rome. Or, if we remember these mediaeval times, they look further off than the Augustan age. The reason may be, that the old Roman literature survives, and creates for us an intimacy with the classic ages, which we have no means of forming with the subsequent ones.|$|E
