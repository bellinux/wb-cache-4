50|$|When a stele {{from the}} 12th Dynasty {{was found in}} Wadi Gasus, in which a nearby port called Saww was mentioned, the University of Alexandria began an {{excavation}} headed by Abdel Monem A.H. Sayed near the Graeco-Roman hydreuma (<b>watering</b> <b>station)</b> where the stele was found. As no other pharaonic monuments were found, {{it was concluded that}} the stele had been transported in Roman times from Saww to the <b>watering</b> <b>station.</b> The search was continued further east at the mouth of Mersa Gasus, where still no pharaonic remains were found.|$|E

Helidon was also supplied with watering facilities.|$|E

[...] Pliny the Elder reports their destination and describes Ocelis as the first stop on the sea journey from Egypt to India.|$|E
50|$|Isaiah is a {{ghost town}} in Butte County, California, United States. It was located 5.5 mi north-northwest of Berry Creek, at an {{elevation}} of 984 feet (300 m). Part of the Bidwell Tract of 1876, It still appeared on maps as of 1948. Isaiah began as a mining community and later {{was used as a}} <b>watering</b> <b>station</b> for steam powered trains. Because of the construction of Oroville Dam (1961), the railroad was re-directed. This led to the inhabitants eventually selling their property. It is now privately owned.|$|E
50|$|The {{settlement}} {{was founded in}} the early 1900s as a workshop and <b>watering</b> <b>station</b> for locomotives. Herero chief Samuel Maharero sold the land to Europeans who resold it in 1903 to the Otavi Minen- und Eisenbahngesellschaft (Otavi Mining and Railway Company) (OMEG) which operated an industrial railway line from Swakopmund to Tsumeb. OMEG established a railway station and a repair shop which was used until the 1960s. When mining operations slowed down, Usakos' importance faded quickly. Today {{it is just a}} drive-through from the Namibian inland to the coast.|$|E

50|$|The Beaumont St. Louis and San Francisco Railroad Retention Pond is a {{retention}} pond originally {{constructed by the}} St. Louis, Wichita, and Western Railway Company as a supply pond for the Beaumont St. Louis and San Francisco Railroad Water Tank. It served the St. Louis, Wichita & Western Railway, and supplied the water tank, which was used to refill the boilers of steam locomotives on that line. It {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places in 2011. From the year of construction until about 1955, when the railroad switched to diesel locomotives, this <b>watering</b> <b>station</b> was essential to railroad transportation.|$|E
50|$|A small town, {{originally}} named Fingal, quickly {{sprang up}} around the station. The township had grown {{such an extent that}} by 1877 tenders had been called {{for the construction of a}} booking office and passenger platform at the station. These improvements were completed by 1878. However, in 1887 a fire at the station destroyed the lamp room and ladies' waiting room. In 1917 the station ceased to be used as a <b>watering</b> <b>station</b> for trains travelling up the range, with watering stations being provided elsewhere on the line (although a 40,000 litre emergency water tank was constructed at the station in 1921 for emergency purposes).|$|E

Three lion masks disgorge water, while the superior structure has a heraldic shield of the viceroy. The Shield is that of Don Pedro Tellez Giron, Duke of Osuna. A plaque in Latin states that: [...] "While Philip II (of Spain) governed, here stopped travelers to venerate {{the waters of the}} Sebeto River, that the choirs of the Aonidi, and the waves of Parnassus, here provide you the source of Melpomene, who sings the aria of the works of the king." ...|$|E

5000|$|Separ is an unincorporated {{community}} in Grant County in the bootheel of southwestern New Mexico, {{in the southwestern}} United States. Although it currently has a small population, it is considered a ghost town. Separ lies in the endorheic Guzmán Basin; {{as a result the}} continental divide passes both to the west and east of it. Located alongside the tracks of the Union Pacific, it flouished in the late 19th and early 20th century as a <b>watering</b> <b>station</b> and livestock transfer point. Separ is located alongside Interstate 10, about 20 miles southeast of Lordsburg and 48 miles west of Deming. Today it is a [...] "service point for truck and car traffic." ...|$|E
50|$|On June 29, 1892, Sheldon Jackson {{visited the}} head of Port Clarence, Alaska, {{in search of a}} {{suitable}} location {{for the establishment of a}} reindeer station. In making a location it was important to take into consideration nearness to the coast of Asia, character of harbor, position with reference to future distribution of reindeer, supply of good pasturage and water. Finding that all these conditions were best met at the <b>watering</b> <b>station</b> of the whaling fleet, on the extreme northeast corner of the bay, near Grantley Harbor, Jackson selected that point for the reindeer station, and on the same day put up two tents, and landed from the steamer Newport the provisions and supplies for the station.|$|E
50|$|Even before filing his claim, Richardson {{had used}} the spring as a <b>watering</b> <b>station</b> {{on the shores of}} what is now called Richardson Bay (an arm of the larger San Francisco Bay), selling fresh water to visiting vessels. However, his {{ownership}} of the land was legally tenuous: other claims had been submitted for the same region, and at any rate Mexican law reserved headlands for military uses, not private ownership. Richardson temporarily abandoned his claim and settled instead outside the Presidio, building the first permanent civilian home and laying out the street plan for the pueblo of Yerba Buena (present-day San Francisco). After years of lobbying and legal wrangling, Richardson was given clear title to all 19751 acre of Rancho del Sausalito on February 11, 1838.|$|E
5000|$|The maps, {{which are}} still {{available}} digitally for download, plot out the placement of rescue beacons and <b>water</b> <b>stations</b> along popular migrant paths. They also map out {{the high number of}} recorded deaths to visually show how the <b>waters</b> <b>stations</b> help mitigate the loss of life. Along with the maps, the organization also created migrant warning posters titled [...] "Don't Do It! It's Hard! There's Not Enough Water!", which are widely distributed along the Mexican side of the border. These posters, aimed at prospective migrants, highlight in stark terms the dangers of illegal crossings on foot through the desert, despite what smugglers might tell them. The posters give the estimated walking times from entry points and also mark the sites of <b>water</b> <b>stations</b> and recorded deaths.|$|R
