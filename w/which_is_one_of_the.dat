5|$|Apollonius' {{problem has}} stimulated much further work. Generalizations to three dimensions—constructing a sphere tangent to four given spheres—and beyond have been studied. The {{configuration}} of three mutually tangent circles has received particular attention. René Descartes gave a formula relating the radii {{of the solution}} circles and the given circles, now known as Descartes' theorem. Solving Apollonius' problem iteratively in this case leads to the Apollonian gasket, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earliest fractals to be described in print, and is important in number theory via Ford circles and the Hardy–Littlewood circle method.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Hans Kelker {{succeeded in}} synthesizing a {{substance}} that had a nematic phase at room temperature, MBBA, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most popular subjects of liquid crystal research. The next step to commercialization of liquid-crystal displays was the synthesis of further chemically stable substances (cyanobiphenyls) with low melting temperatures by George Gray. That work with Ken Harrison and the UK MOD (RRE Malvern), in 1973, led to design of new materials resulting in rapid adoption of small area LCDs within electronic products.|$|E

5|$|Owing to the {{scarcity}} of artefacts and inscriptions relating to Menkauhor's reign, few of his activities are known.

The mines of Sinai had been exploited since the Third Dynasty (2686 BC–2613 BC), and both Menkauhor's predecessor Nyuserre Ini and successor Djedkare Isesi sent expeditions to the Wadi Maghareh.|$|E
