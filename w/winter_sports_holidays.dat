50|$|In {{the second}} half of the 20th century, after the end of mining in the valley, tourism became the area's {{dominant}} economic activity. In 2003, tourists stayed a total of 6 million nights in the valley, mostly during <b>winter</b> <b>sports</b> <b>holidays.</b> Following a phase of mergers by building connecting lifts during the 1990s and early 2000s, there are now four big ski areas and three smaller satellite areas in the valley, with a combined total of more than 170 lifts and more than 630 km of downhill slopes.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to develop a {{typology}} for winter sports tourists deriving from the behavioural characteristics of British skiers and snowboarders. The paper also aimed to ascertain whether differences in the characteristics and behaviour of skiers and snowboarders were identifiable, and consequently whether the market could be meaningfully segmented based upon the sport participated in. Segmentation was data driven with results collected through an online questionnaire targeting members of British ski clubs and online forums. Data collection took place during the 2011 - 2012 winter season, where 926 responses were collected, 831 of which were appropriate for use. Six segments were identified using factor-cluster analysis: après scene, relaxation seekers, anything goes, enthusiasts, and jet set enthusiasts. It was also determined that three core motivations - social motivations, sport motivations and relaxation motivations - characterise the British winter sports market. Sport type was ascertained to be influential as a criterion in segmenting winter sports tourist, where discrepancies were identified between the skiers and snowboarders in terms of motivation and behaviours affecting destination choice and buying behaviour. Theoretical and practical implications for ski industry were discussed, most notably in relation to the packaging of <b>winter</b> <b>sports</b> <b>holidays</b> and destination marketing...|$|E

25|$|Support for {{the monarchy}} floated around 80%, unless {{members of the}} royal family engaged in dubious activities. Examples of these are when in 2000, Beatrix went on a <b>winter</b> <b>sport</b> <b>holiday</b> in Austria, that was boycotted by Europe at the time because Jörg Haider's Freedom Party was in government, or when Willem-Alexander and Máxima had a villa built in Mozambique in 2007, which they {{eventually}} abandoned under great pressure. Geert Wilders, leader of the new right-wing populist Party for Freedom (PVV), was displeased by the 2007 Christmas speech by queen Beatrix, which he found biased and full of thinly veiled criticism of the PVV. Ever since, he has argued for the king/queen to be deprived of all political powers, but also to maintain a purely ceremonial kingship, although some suspect the PVV and/or Wilders to actually be republican. According to a survey by Maurice de Hond from 2014, the percentage of convinced republican is twice as high amongst PVV voters (29%) than the general public (15%), but still a minority.|$|R

40|$|NoAccording to {{annual reports}} of European and North American ski resort corporations, <b>winter</b> <b>sports</b> {{destinations}} are facing stagnating markets {{and at the same}} time challenges in the management of environmentally sensitive mountainous areas and villages. The survival and development of <b>winter</b> <b>sports</b> destinations are to a large extent centred around strategies for creating competitive advantage {{and at the same time}} meeting the criteria of sustainable tourism laid down by the WTO. In this paper, performance on these two dimensions is combined into the concept of strategic performance. Sustained value creation is suggested as a goal of strategic performance in <b>winter</b> <b>sports</b> destinations. Two new models related to the strategic analysis of <b>winter</b> <b>sports</b> destinations are developed. The first is a suggested configuration of value creation in <b>winter</b> <b>sports</b> destinations¿the ¿value fan¿¿and the second is a conceptual organisational model providing a framework for analysis at strategic level of such destinations. The models have emerged from examining the central body of literature in the field of strategic management. Development of the models is part of ongoing research into what kind of organisational structure of <b>winter</b> <b>sports</b> destinations will lead to superior performance in terms of strategic success. Here the concepts of the ¿community model¿ and the ¿corporate model¿ of destination management are introduced...|$|R
