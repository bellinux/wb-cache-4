5|$|Of the 22 {{species of}} {{albatross}} recognised by the IUCN, all {{are listed as}} at some level of concern; 3 species are Critically Endangered, 5 species are Endangered, 7 species are Near Threatened, and 7 species are Vulnerable. Numbers of albatrosses have declined in the past due to harvesting for feathers, but today the albatrosses are threatened by introduced species, such as rats and feral cats that attack eggs, chicks and nesting adults; by pollution; by a serious decline in fish stocks in many regions largely due to overfishing; and by longline fishing. Longline fisheries pose the greatest threat, as feeding birds are attracted to the bait, become hooked on the lines, and drown. Identified stakeholders such as governments, conservation organisations {{and people in the}} fishing industry are all <b>working</b> <b>toward</b> reducing this bycatch.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, MFP Baseball and the Mayor's Office began <b>working</b> <b>toward</b> a new stadium, {{with the}} city {{identifying}} three potential sites for construction, and recruiting stadium-builder Populous to study each. The three sites were an area on {{the north end of}} The Gulch, the site of Nashville's first ballpark (Sulphur Dell), and various areas directly adjacent to Nissan Stadium and the eastern terminus of the John Seigenthaler Pedestrian Bridge. The Sounds still preferred the Thermal site due to its proximity to the city's entertainment and central business districts, but the city was not willing to make a second attempt at a stadium in that location (Ascend Amphitheater was eventually built there). Mayor Karl Dean preferred the Sulphur Dell site, in an attempt to bolster economic growth on downtown's sluggish North side, while incorporating the ballpark into the surrounding neighborhoods. In late summer 2013, the Sounds and the Nashville Metropolitan Government reached an agreement to build a new $37million downtown ballpark at Sulphur Dell. Construction on First Tennessee Park began after necessary land-swaps with the State of Tennessee, and the new ballpark opened in time {{for the start of the}} 2015 season.|$|E
5|$|Though UCSC {{has been}} known for its {{conservation}} efforts and environmentally minded students since it was founded, since 2000 enthusiasm for the UCSC sustainability movement has grown steadily among students and administrators alike. Students established the Student Environmental Center (SEC) in 2001, have held annual Earth Summits, and established a sustainability funding body, the Campus Sustainability Council. In 2004, the UC Policy on Sustainable Practices was released, stating that the University of California Office of the President was committed to minimizing its impact on the environment and reducing its dependence on non-renewable energy. This set the scene for huge breakthroughs in 2006, when a Committee on Sustainability and Stewardship (CSS) was established and a campus-wide Sustainability Assessment was completed. The following year, the pilot Sustainability Office was created to help institutionalize sustainability, coordinate communication and collaboration between the many entities already engaged in campus sustainability activities at UCSC, support policy implementation, and serve as a resource for the campus. Sustainability has become a major part of every aspect of the campus, and students, staff, and faculty campus-wide are <b>working</b> <b>toward</b> sustainability in a variety of different ways.|$|E

40|$|Health care {{professionals}} are the gate-keepers for elderly health information. Unfavorable attitude {{to the elderly}} posts an obstacle to health information delivery. Therefore, {{it is vital to}} identify the knowledge and attitude of nursing students <b>toward</b> <b>working</b> with the elderly. The present study aimed to examine the knowledge and <b>working</b> preferences <b>toward</b> the elderly among undergraduate nursing students in Hong Kong. Two hundred and sixty-nine students completed a questionnaire that incorporated 70 questions in the Palmore's Aging Quiz and 10 questions reflecting the knowledge on local community resources for the elderly. The results revealed that nursing students generally have a neutral to positive <b>working</b> preferences <b>toward</b> the elderly. 83 % of them gained a mean Palmore's score of 40. 90 out of 70 (SD = 5. 02) and good knowledge of the community resources (mean score = 8. 49, SD = 1. 85). Those who disliked working with the elderly had a significantly lower mean Palmore's score (F = 7. 73, p = 0. 001). Though the level of study had a positive correlation with the knowledge of community resources, it did not increase with Palmore's score. Further research on the study results and more detail examination of geriatric education for nursing students to refine their attitude toward the elderly are recommended. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
