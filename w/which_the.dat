5|$|In {{most species}} the sexes are separate, {{but all the}} {{freshwater}} species are hermaphroditic. Nemerteans often have numerous temporary gonads (ovaries or testes), and build temporary gonoducts (ducts from <b>which</b> <b>the</b> ova or sperm are emitted), one per gonad, when the ova and sperm are ready. The eggs are generally fertilised externally. Some species shed them into the water, and others protect their eggs in various ways. The fertilized egg divides by spiral cleavage and grows by determinate development, in <b>which</b> <b>the</b> fate of a cell can usually be predicted from its predecessors {{in the process of}} division. The embryos of most taxa develop either directly to form juveniles (like the adult but smaller) or to form planuliform larvae, in <b>which</b> <b>the</b> larva's long axis {{is the same as the}} juvenile's. However, some form a pilidium larva, in <b>which</b> <b>the</b> developing juvenile has a gut which lies across the larva's body, and usually eats the remains of the larva when it emerges. The bodies of some species fragment readily, and even parts near the tail can grow full bodies.|$|E
