40|$|Medicinal {{products}} from bees Cue: Honey {{has been used}} as a form of medicine since ancient times. But while honey medicine might normally be associated with traditional healers, in recent years, the value of honey as a tool for fighting bacteria has been increasingly recognised by hospital-trained doctors. And it is not only honey that can be used to support human health. Other bee products such as royal jelly and bee venom are also widely used, particularly in Japan, the world?s leading importer of medicinal bee products. Some people claim that royal jelly, a substance produced by worker bees as a food for the queen bee, can offer a wide range of medical benefits. While these claims have not yet been fully backed up by science, royal jelly does have anti-bacterial properties and is a concentrated source of nutrients. People living in Arumeru district in northern Tanzania are very familiar with the healing powers of honey. Traditional healers in the area use honey to treat coughs, stomach ulcers, malaria and burns. Local organisation Dakika trains women?s groups to produce honey, both for sale and for the production of medicines. These are sold in various outlets, both within Tanzania and further afield. Lazarus Laiser visited the Dakika headquarters and spoke to extension officer David Pallangyo and to Celina Peter, one of the members. He asked Celina to describe the activities the organisation is involved in. IN:		?We have so many activities we ? OUT:		?our product has good quality. ? DUR?N:	 3 ? 58 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: David Pallangyo, a beekeeping extension worker, describing the medicinal products made by the Dakika organisation in northern Tanzania. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Peter	We have so many activities we do in the Dakika group. Most of all is beekeeping and education, we deal about education. Laiser	<b>When</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>start</b> with beekeeping? Peter	Beekeeping was started in 1991. Laiser	So you get a kind of training? Peter	In our group we get so many seminars in how to make beehives, and we are using traditional beehives and modern beehives, and how to get beehives, we are making ourselves. Examples of traditional hives, we have log hives and bar hives. In modern, we have commercial or moveable frame, and Tanzania top-bar. Pallangyo	My name is David Pallangyo. I am a beekeeping extension officer in Dakika group. Laiser	What are your key points in Dakika? Pallangyo	(Vernac) For one to succeed in beekeeping it is good to search for advice from professionals in beekeeping. This will help you to get good honey from the hive safely, without breaking the honeycombs. Also, the use of smoke pipe is helping to avoid burning the forest and also to avoid disturbance to the environment and bees. It is also recommended to use equipment for bees. These equipments would help to protect from bees stings. And the equipments are like gumboots, an overall, face cap, gloves and smoke pipe. Laiser	Celina, how do you market your product, your honey and other honey products? Peter	We market our product in Tanzania and in the outside of Tanzania. Because in this group we have so many centres outside of the country. We have the centre of Mombassa and Uganda. We take the medicine ourselves and we go everywhere to sell, for example to the markets or to any centre. The bee products are honey, wax, royal jelly, and bee venom. Laiser	Which medicines are you, Dakika, able to make and produce from the bee products? Peter	They are royal jelly. From royal jelly we can get the medicine which is called temu. Temu is used to treat fungus. And from honey we can get the medicine called ngenuwa and moru. Ngenuwa we treat the ulcers and moru we treat cancer. From bee venom we can get tanika. Tanika is the medicine used to treat joints. Laiser	Is it allowed by the government for you to continue in the business of producing the medicines? Peter	The regional pharmacist, they accept our products, and give us permission to sell our medicine in different places inside the country and outside the country. Laiser	How do you ensure cleanliness of the products? Pallangyo	(Vernac) We are quite sure of the cleanliness of the products. In the room where the production is being carried out, nobody is allowed to get into the room, except the one who is making the product. For example, the one who is making what we call temu medicine will be dealing with that only, and nobody else. Many people come back to give us some feedback that the medicine has helped them, and that is really good for us. So we are very proud that our product has good quality. End of track. Use of honey, royal jelly and bee venom to make various medical remedies for problems such as ulcers and fungus...|$|E

30|$|Given companies’ {{intention}} to expand customer relationships {{and to increase}} customer revenues, WOM affects not only the sales of other customers (Chevalier and Mayzlin 2006; Hinz et al. 2011) but also the sales of the senders, repeat purchases, or additional purchases through up- or cross-selling (Kumar et al. 2010; Armelini et al. 2015). Up- or cross-selling in the mobile phone context could involve extended talk or data plans, hardware, or auxiliary services (e.g., Company: “Upgrade your data plan and get 1  GB data free!”). In this case, social media interactions serve {{as a source of}} information from which customers learn about products and services and form their attitude regarding them. This information sharing occurs not only by following company-initiated brand posts but also by actively interacting with the brand (e.g., commenting, liking, or inquiring on information such as User: “I really like the iPhone. <b>When</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>start</b> selling it?”). Through such frequent social media interactions, attitudes towards the brand become more accessible for prospective customers. Consequently, the increase in the attitude accessibility facilitates customers’ subsequent purchasing behavior (Downing et al. 1992; Morwitz et al. 1993). Although frequent brand-related interactions via social media and the subsequent increased involvement of customers with positive experiences would reflect higher up- and cross-selling and further developed customer relationships, we would expect the opposite effect for those who voice their negative experiences.|$|R

[...] In the opening scene of the film, as the dark-haired woman stumbles off Mulholland Drive, silently it suggests she is clumsy.

Hageman also identifies [...] "perpetual and uncanny ambient sound", and places a particular emphasis on the scene where the man collapses behind Winkie's as normal sound is drowned out by a buzzing roar, noting that the noise [...] "creates a dissonance and suspense that draws in the spectator as detective to place the sound and reestablish order". Mulholland Drives ending with the woman at Club Silencio whispering {{is an example of}} Lynch's aural deception and surreality, according to Ruth Perlmutter, who writes, [...] "The acting, the dreams, the search for identity, the fears and terrors of the undefined self are over when the film is over, and therefore, there is only silence and enigma." ...|$|R

40|$|Translation begins] Wednesday My Darling, When I {{got home}} from work tonight found two valentines and a letter from you. You’re so sweet, honey- Happy Valentine’s day, darling. This letter {{certainly}} isn’t progressing very rapidly. Interruptions- always interruptions. Let’s see, where was I. Oh, yes, happy- oh I said that already as you can tell I’m a little confused. Have you told Sweetie what time we’re getting married? What a nice sound that has. Will he be able to get there in time? How far away are you from him? It’s freezing in here- I’m curled up under a blanket. Wish you were here honey. Boy will I be glad to get down there where it’s nice and warm. Probably the temperature will hit an all time low march 9 th. Golly, darling, why does time go so darned slowly when we’re apart and so fast the minute we’re together. Trying to locate my calendar now to count the days until March 11 th. About five times a day I count and always get the same answer. Found it. Only 25 more days, darling. Will you be able to see us at all. I hope that we can be together for a while before we’re married. Everyone keeps telling me that’s the happiest time- fine thing, that’s very encouraging. But it certainly has been wonderful even though we weren’t together very much. In 12 more days I won’t be working. That will be so nice. Lying in bed all morning, what a lovely dream. Golly, I won’t be able to lie in bed in the morning until after we’re married- I’ll have to much to do. Remember that street car conductor that I told you about. He married 12 women + said he must have been crazy. He looked like such a wonderful nice old man. That just goes to prove- you never can tell about men! Oh, honey, I finally found a Valentine that was half way what I wanted. You probably won’t get it until after Valentine’s day. Anyway, the thought was there. What a day. We got out early today again. Thank goodness. I’m sorry that I didn’t write last night or at least I don’t think I did. At this point I’m not sure about anything. Honestly, what a fog I’m in. Anyhow to get back to last night. Went to see “The Very Thought of You”. Gee, it was cute- Have you seen it? It reminded me so much of you + I + Woody + Steve. Almost any picture lately reminds me of you though. You wrote in your letter last Friday that you missed me that night more than usual. It’s the strangest thing but I missed you more that night and loved you more than usual. Isn’t that strange. That Jack Carson show is on again. He’s in a plane sitting in a bomb bay, or on it or whatever <b>you</b> <b>do</b> in a bomb bay door. Anyway, Jack wanted {{to know what to do}} if the bomb bay doors opened. Teacher said pick out a nice German factory and don’t forget to go “bang” when you hit it. Gee, darling, I love you so much. I wish we were together tonight and every night. Gee, honey, I hope you get that night flying over with soon. You’ll be so tired if you don’t try to get as much rest as you can before we come down. <b>When</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>start</b> on your night cross countries? How many <b>do</b> <b>you</b> have? On those x countries, honey, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> fly more than four hours? I love the way you tell me that you’re going to try to call me and then you never call when you plan to + besides I always get the letters days after you’ve called. I’m so glad that you’re going to get the rings, honey. I wasn’t looking forward to picking them out at all. Oh, don’t forget I wear 3 ½. I had the engagement ring 3 34 / 4 but it’s too big and slides all around – 3 ½ was what he wanted me to have but I never take advice. Have to find out for myself. We don’t have wedding invitations, honey, but we will have announcements. So if you’ll be a good little angel and sit down and make out a list of all your friends that you’d like to tell you’re married, it will help no end. That’s a pretty big order, I know but about how many people would you like to send them to? Give me a rough idea. Not too rough but a good guess. Overestimate rather than underestimate- they’ll probably be millions because I can think of millions off hand. Gee, darling, I wish you were still at Stewart Field- that stationary brings back memories- wasn’t it wonderful when you were getting home every weekend? We were so lucky, hon, to have so much time together. You cost me no end of money lately with all this writing- Because at this point I’m all out of envelopes again. Don’t have any idea of how I’ll mail tis. Yes, honey, that’s the way I figured it out. Texas just should have horses- It sounds very logical. Remember the Rodeo? I hope that we can find some horses because I love riding so. We still haven’t gone together. Every weekend it gets colder + colder or snows or something and I don’t go maybe next weekend. Gee, darling, I wish I could get a sunburn before the wedding. It would look so nice with a white dress. How many hours <b>do</b> <b>you</b> have now, honey? Charlotte’s definitely coming down as you probably know by now. I’m so glad because I wanted someone I knew to be there. What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> about the rooms honey? Did you change the reservations? What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> get? They’re going to get mighty tired of your changing our reservations all the times. We’d all like to be together if possible. If they have a double bed + a single in one room that would be all right. Charlotte and I could sleep on a windowsill. Honestly, honey, you and weather- It’s really pitiful. I do wish you’d carry a thermometer around with you for a few hours and find out the temperature is. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> think the nights will stay real cool? My fur coat, haven’t worn it since you left. Gee, how exciting, a June bride by temperature. Honestly, what a wedding! Golly, nothing normal or usual ever happens to us. If you go over from the West Coast, darling, can I be with you in California until you go over? Then maybe I could study in California for a while and work in a B- 29 factory and do something to help you. I wouldn’t mind doing anything if it would help bring you home sooner. Honey, there isn’t much change of your going to Europe honey, is there? I wish they’d send you to England. At least you get home once in a while there. Well, honey 24 weeks will be over in about the end of August of the beginning of September. And you were the one who gave me the idea that you’d be in combat before October, honey. That’s one thing, honey, don’t try to keep anything from one for fear that I’ll worry or anything like that. Maybe I will to a certain extent but I’d be too busy being happy in the time that we had to worry about when you were going over. But, as you said, that’s a long way off, honey and we’ll think about that later. Gee, honey, in the movies they always think of so many ways to tell each other how much they love each other but I never can- Aught to change my writers- get new ideas. But I <b>do</b> love <b>you</b> so, darling. Someday, maybe, you’ll know how much. Every once in a while I just can’t believe that it’s happening to us. You’re so wonderful, honey and it just seems too wonderful to believe. Golly, March 11 th will certainly be some day for you. Getting your wings and married in the same day- within a few hours, too. I have to keep writing because I don’t have any envelope, I didn’t think so this will go on indefinitely, on second thought I’d better not- Have a few real tiny envelopes. Golly, darling, imagine us getting married. I still can’t believe it. It’s marvelous to be in love with you. You’re so wonderful and sweet. Did you get the rings yet honey? Don’t forget to tell me <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> Oh, honey, please tell me about the scotch. I’ve got to know soon, honey or it will be too late to get any. May go to the movies with Daddy tomorrow night but I’ll write no matter how short it is. I love you more than anything in the world. I’ll love you with all my heart.

5000|$|The album {{received}} generally favourable reviews with Metacritic {{giving it}} a score of 80% from 7 reviews. AllMusic awarded the album 3½ stars and in its review by Matt Collar, states [...] "Ultimately, Where <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Start</b> is an intimate, impressionistic, and probing release that should certainly appeal to longtime fans of Mehldau's nuanced jazz style". The Guardian's John Fordham observed [...] "the dynamics and empathy of this ensemble remain pretty irresistible". On All About Jazz, John Kelman noted [...] "Where <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Start</b> isn't so much an alternative as it is further evidence—as if any were needed—of this tremendous trio's ability to take any material—old, new, borrowed or original—and make it firmly its own". BBC Music reviewer, Martin Longley commented [...] "Where <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Start</b> revives the old Mehldau approach of covering songs from across the decades... Yet Mehldau’s method is so dominant that everything gravitates towards the trio’s signature sound, lending cohesion to a variegated crop... It all points to Mehldau entering a new prime phase in his career, both onstage and in the recording studio".|$|R
