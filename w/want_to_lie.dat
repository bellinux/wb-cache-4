25|$|The {{ability to}} go on when you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> down and quit is important. Most people can do far more than they ever thought possible. Success in doing the {{difficult}} in one area {{makes it easier to}} succeed in another.|$|E
500|$|In October 2001, Fred Durst {{posted on}} the band's website: [...] "Limp Bizkit and Wes Borland have {{amicably}} decided to part ways. Both Limp Bizkit and Borland will continue to pursue their respective musical careers. Both wish each other {{the best of luck}} in all future endeavors." [...] Borland explained why he left Limp Bizkit; he said: [...] "I could have probably gone on and still played the part of the guitar player of Limp Bizkit, but musically I was kind of bored. If I was to continue, it would have been about the money and not about the true music, and I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> to myself, or to them or to fans of Limp Bizkit." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{commentary}} for Rejected on the Bitter Films Vol. 1 DVD, Hertzfeldt stated that [...] "You never <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> to your audience... you can trick them, you can disturb them, you can annoy them, {{but you can}} never lie to them. To me commercials are nothing but lies." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{ambassador}} {{has stated}} that his daughter had witnessed the atrocities she described and that her presence in Kuwait could be verified by the United States Embassy in Kuwait. He also stated [...] "If I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie,</b> or if we <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie,</b> if we <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> exaggerate, I wouldn't use my daughter to do so. I could easily buy other people to do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Hastings {{turned to}} Agatha. [...] "He calls working from sunrise until it's dark, and {{afterwards}} now and then, amusement!" [...] She {{looked back at}} Wyllard. [...] "I believe it isn't quite {{easy for you to}} hold your back as straight as you are doing, and that off-horse certainly looks as if it <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> down." ...|$|R
50|$|After {{the party}} Jill drags a tired Don {{to her place}} and {{realising}} she must be rid of Terry once and for all, runs upstairs and smothers him with a cushion. Don finds the bathroom, vomits and opens the bedroom door <b>to</b> find Jill <b>lying</b> seductively on the bed. Don, just <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> down and too tired to be bothered, falls into Jill’s arms.|$|R
6000|$|... "And Parsons, your trader at Hickimavi, told me {{that the}} Fulcrum Company had bought that station from you. Now what did he <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> for?" ...|$|E
60|$|THE NEWLY BORN. I {{will do what}} I like. But {{there is}} {{something}} the matter with me. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> down. I cannot keep my eyes open.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said Bland rather sternly, [...] "I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> open to any misconception, but I {{understood}} that Mrs. Marston had some means. I'm quite prepared to hear they're small." ...|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Designers, {{stay away}} from {{corporations}} that <b>want</b> you <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> for them; on billboard, Las Vegas. (c) Jonathan Barnbrook, 1999 ...|$|R
2500|$|Rubin, {{through his}} son and law partner, I. Mark Rubin, brought {{the case to the}} Supreme Court, but the matter had already been settled by Rubin having served his jail time for refusing to {{represent}} a client who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> on the witness stand. When he emerged from jail, he had grown a beard which he called, [...] "my badge of courage", as it became his trademark throughout the rest of his career.|$|R
50|$|Pearson—Pearson strikes up {{an early}} {{friendship}} with the Musketeers. He is described as having glasses and dark hair. He cracks jokes and is reasonably cheery. He usually makes commentary on things which Garraty responds too and is often a voice of reason among Garraty and his friends. As he begins to tire out, he mentions that he just <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> down in a field and compose a poem. He is shot offscreen.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ain't you {{tired to}} death? Don't you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> down?" [...] said Fanny, {{sitting on the}} side of the bed in Polly's room, and {{chattering}} hard, while she examined everything her friend had on.|$|E
60|$|Lucy did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> {{and she did}} {{not know}} what to say. Presently Bostil bade her good night. Lucy {{endeavored}} to read, but her mind continually wandered back to the adventure of the day.|$|E
6000|$|Some man, {{apparently}} the sexton, had observed Clare standing there, and drew nigh. [...] "Ah, sir, now that's {{a man who}} didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> here, but wished to be carried to Kingsbere, where his ancestors be." ...|$|E
5000|$|Phoebus de Chateaupers is the Captain of the King's Archers. After he saves Esmeralda from abduction, {{she becomes}} {{infatuated}} with him, {{and he is}} intrigued by her. Already betrothed to the beautiful but spiteful Fleur-de-Lys, he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> with Esmeralda nonetheless but is prevented when Frollo stabs him. Phoebus survives, but Esmeralda is taken to be the attempted assassin by all, including Phoebus himself, who no longer wants her. He is later married to Fleur-de-Lys and is miserable.|$|R
30|$|Some of the subjects, {{although}} not {{referring to a}} decrease in pain after the AAA, showed improvement in mood and motivation as reported by their companions. One of the patient’s companions stated {{that the child was}} not motivated to talk that day, but that after the arrival of the dog, the patient talked and smiled. Another companion reported that the patient only <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> down due <b>to</b> the pain, but that {{in the presence of the}} dog, they sat up.|$|R
60|$|Before he left Genoa he {{had thought}} that it was {{possible}} that he might make this sort of an attack upon the Dunkery Beacon, and he had therefore provided for it. He had shipped a number of grappling-irons with long chains attached which were run through ring-bolts on his deck. With these and other appliances for making fast to a vessel alongside, Banker was sure he could stick to an enemy or a prize as long as he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> by her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Butler {{wants to}} try it," [...] {{answered}} Watson. [...] "There's no reason why you shouldn't let him. I dumped the magazine he sent you in the coulée. I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> about smoking too near the detonators." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{long and}} short is, you're scared, Marks; but I can't help that,--you've got to go. Suppose you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> by a day or two, till the gal 's been carried on the {{underground}} line up to Sandusky or so, before you start." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm all burning up, {{and my head}} is SO funny. I don't {{want any}} tea. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> on your sofa {{and go to sleep}} again. Can I?" [...] asked Rosy, with a dizzy look about the room, and a shiver at the idea of eating.|$|E
60|$|But he only <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> {{down and}} not be disturbed. Stumbling through the trees, he came on a quiet place where beeches and pine trees grew on a slope. Immediately he had lain down and closed his eyes, his {{consciousness}} went racing on without him. A big pulse of sickness beat in him as if it throbbed through the whole earth. He was burning with dry heat. But he was too busy, too tearingly active in the incoherent race of delirium to observe.|$|R
5000|$|The Downe tradesmen were disappointed, the publican {{pointing}} out that it [...] "would have helped the place so much, for it would have brought hosts of people down to see his grave". The joiner had [...] "made his coffin {{just the way he}} wanted it, all rough, just as it left the bench, no polish, no nothin", but this was returned and replaced by one [...] "you could see to shave in". He added that [...] "They buried him in Westminster Abbey, but he always <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> here, and I don't think he'd have liked it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I can't {{get hold}} of them,' he said distractedly to himself. He felt {{detached}} from the earth, from all the near, concrete, beloved things; as if these had melted away from him, and left him, sick and unsupported, somewhere alone {{on the edge of}} an enormous space. He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> down again, <b>to</b> relieve himself of the sickening effort of supporting and controlling his body. If he could lie down again perfectly still he need not struggle to animate the cumbersome matter of his body, and then he would not feel thus sick and outside himself.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Have I {{not told}} you,' {{said the other}} fiercely, 'that I have striven and {{wrestled}} with the power that brought me here? Has my whole life, for eight-and-twenty years, been one perpetual struggle and resistance, {{and do you think}} I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> down and die? Do all men shrink from death--I most of all!' ...|$|E
6000|$|His {{companion}} snickered. [...] "Only that {{it would}} probably knock you over, I'd let you go and see. It's wise to keep clear of the gases after firing giant powder. They haven't {{the same effect on}} everybody, but most men who get a whiff of them <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> down {{for the rest of the}} day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here, my good girl," [...] he says; [...] "you don't {{understand}} me, or I don't understand you, {{one or the}} other. When I go to sleep, I lie on a bed {{and pull}} the clothes over me. I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> on the clothes, and cover myself with the bed. This isn't a comic ballet, you know!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tush!" [...] said Smith. [...] "And {{possibly}} bah! Do {{you suppose}} that {{the sort of man}} who runs Broster Street is likely to care a darn about publicity? What does it matter to him if the papers soak it to him for about two days? He knows they'll drop him and go on to something else on the third, and he knows he's broken no law. No, there's something more in this business than that. Don't think that this bright boy <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> hush us up simply because he is a sensitive plant who can't bear to think that people should be cross with him. He has got some private reason for <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> low." ...|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, {{the others}} are {{introduced}} to Aline Penhallow and her cousin Sebastian Verlac. Some members of the Clave <b>want</b> Simon <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> and say that he, along with the Lightwood family, are Valentine's spies, but Simon refuses, which leads to his imprisonment.|$|R
5000|$|On June 6, 1949, Zussman was disinterred from a {{military}} cemetery and reburied in Machpelah Cemetery in Ferndale, Michigan. [...] The city government of Detroit <b>wanted</b> Zussman <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> in state at Detroit City Hall, but Zussman's disraught father declined the honor.|$|R
6000|$|... “Well, I guess we’ll get breakfast to‐morrow, if we’re alive,” he said. “I’ve {{lived on}} some kind of curious things in Cuba, {{including}} fricassee of mule, but onions, bad guavas, and half‐ripe mangoes, as a mixture for fighting on, doesn’t suit my taste at all. No, sir. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> down nice and quiet, and not worry anybody, when I’ve got dysentery.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} round to leave some orders with Mr. Berners' servant," [...] he said, [...] "and after that I am going. You must ring for {{anything}} you want, {{and the man}} will show you your room if you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> down. I dare say, though, that some one {{will come from the}} Hall presently. The sea will be calmer in a few hours' time." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{waited for}} {{about a half a}} minute, but she was not called by name. Then she and Martin went away. She had nearly reached the cabin before she spoke, and then she turned to the young man and said: [...] "Martin, you needn't trouble {{yourself}} about putting up that hammock now; I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> in it. I'm going into the house. I am very much obliged to you for the way you stood by me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, but I {{might have}} been tracked to this cabin. And look here, Flip," [...] he said, {{suddenly}} straightening himself, and lifting the girl's face to a level with his own, [...] "I don't <b>want</b> you <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> any more for me. It ain't right." ...|$|R
60|$|They had {{tea in the}} drawing-room. The Angel sat on {{the music}} stool (music stool because of his wings). At first he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> on the hearthrug. He looked much less radiant in the Vicar's clothes, than he had done upon the moor when dressed in saffron. His face shone still, the colour of his hair and cheeks was strangely bright, {{and there was a}} superhuman light in his eyes, but his wings under the {{overcoat}} gave him the appearance of a hunchback. The garments, indeed, made quite a terrestrial thing of him, the trousers were puckered transversely, and the shoes a size or so too large.|$|R
6000|$|The child seemed {{anxious about}} something, and Mrs. Milray, who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> go and <b>lie</b> down, too, asked a little impatiently, [...] "What is it, Clementina?" ...|$|R
