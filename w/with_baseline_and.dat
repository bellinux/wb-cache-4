40|$|Bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) {{proteins}} regulate transcription of lipoprotein and inflammatory factors {{implicated in}} atherosclerosis. The impact of BET inhibition on atherosclerosis progression is unknown. ASSURE was a double-blind, randomized, multicenter trial in which 323 patients with angiographic coronary disease and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were randomized in a 3 : 1 fashion to treatment with the BET protein inhibitor RVX- 208 200 mg or placebo for 26 weeks. Plaque progression {{was measured with}} serial intravascular ultrasound imaging. Lipid levels, safety, and tolerability were also assessed. During treatment, apolipoprotein (apo) A-I increased by 10. 6 % with placebo (P < 0. 001 compared <b>with</b> <b>baseline)</b> <b>and</b> 12. 8 % with RVX- 208 (P < 0. 001 compared with baseline), between groups P = 0. 18.

The primary endpoint, the change in percent atheroma volume, decreased 0. 30 % in placebo-treated patients (P = 0. 23 compared <b>with</b> <b>baseline)</b> <b>and</b> 0. 40 % in the RVX- 208 group (P = 0. 08 compared with baseline), between groups P = 0. 81.

A greater incidence of elevated liver enzymes was observed in RVX- 208 -treated patients (7. 1 vs. 0 %, P = 0. 009).

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study prospectively {{examined}} {{changes in}} cognition in hypogonadal men given testosterone (T) or older hypogonadal men given dihydrotestosterone (DHT) gel. A battery of cognitive tests assessing verbal and spatial memory, language, and attention was administered at baseline (prior to medication) {{and again at}} days 90 and 180 of treatment for men receiving T gel and at baseline and days 30 and 90 of treatment for men receiving DHT gel. For men receiving T gel, circulating total T and estradiol (E 2) were significantly raised compared <b>with</b> <b>baseline,</b> <b>and</b> a significant improvement in verbal memory was observed. For men receiving DHT gel, serum DHT levels increased and T levels decreased significantly compared <b>with</b> <b>baseline,</b> <b>and</b> a significant improvement in spatial memory was observed. The results suggest that beneficial changes in cognition can occur in hypogonadal men using T replacement levels and DHT treatment, and these changes in cognition can be reliably measured during a relative steady-state dose level. Further, our results suggest that aromatization of T to E 2 may regulate verbal memory in men, whereas nonaromatizable androgens may regulate spatial memory...|$|E

Group I, II, and III comprised 87, 125, and 89 consecutive subjects with disease duration at presentation of less than 4, 4 - 24, and 25 - 255 months, respectively. Initial therapy was with combinations of pulse intravenous (i. v.) methylprednisolone (0 - 125 mg), cyclophosphamide (100 - 200 mg), methotrexate (MTX, 5 - 15 i. v. mg/week) and simultaneous oral cyclosporin A (CSA, 25 mg bid/tid). After disease was controlled i. v. therapy was tapered and switched to oral MTX + CSA.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of a food supplement containing α-lipoic acid and of a placebo on glyco-metabolic control and on oxidative stress markers in type 2 diabetics. We randomized 105 diabetics to either a supplementation containing 600 mg of α-lipoic acid, 165 mg of L-carnosin, 7. 5 mg of zinc, and vitamins of group B, or a placebo, for three months. We evaluated body mass index, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), post-prandial-glucose (PPG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c), fasting plasma insulin (FPI), HOMA-index (HOMA-IR), lipid profile, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), malondialdehyde (MDA). There was a reduction of FPG, PPG, and HbA 1 c with the food supplement containing α-lipoic acid compared <b>with</b> a <b>baseline,</b> <b>and</b> <b>with</b> the placebo. Concerning lipid profile, we observed a reduction of LDL-C, and Tg with the food supplement, compared <b>with</b> both the <b>baseline,</b> <b>and</b> the placebo.

In order to evaluate whether optokinetic stimulation could influence time perception, a group of healthy subjects performed "time-comparison" tasks of sub- and supra-second intervals before and after leftward or rightward optokinetic stimulation. Subjective time perception was biased by the direction of optokinetic stimulation.
