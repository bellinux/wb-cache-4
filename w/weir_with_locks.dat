5000|$|In 1872, {{the railway}} line Aschaffenburg to Miltenberg was opened, with {{a stop at}} Obernburg. The first local bridge across the Main was built in 1892. In 1915-7 the Main was channeled and the <b>weir</b> <b>with</b> <b>lock</b> and a {{hydroelectric}} plant was constructed.|$|R
5000|$|Another act {{was passed}} in 1894 which {{consisted}} mainly of tidying up legislation.

New locks were Grafton Lock and Northmoor Lock in 1896 and Shifford Lock in 1898. Also in 1898 the conservancy rebuilt Pinkhill and Rushey. [...] Downstream, Boveney was rebuilt in 1898, <b>with</b> the old <b>lock</b> replaced by a boat slide and Shepperton was also rebuilt on a different alignment in 1899.|$|R
50|$|The {{works were}} {{to include the}} {{creation}} of a flood control structure near Nußdorf. Wilhelm von Engerth's floating barrier, the Schwimmtor, which entered service in 1873, did not provide sufficient protection. Three, possibly four <b>weirs</b> <b>with</b> <b>locks</b> were also planned to ensure the necessary water depth for passing ships. Another flood control structure near the point where the Danube Canal joined the Danube was to be considered in order to prevent floodwater from the river washing back into the canal.|$|R

40|$|This paper completes {{knowledge}} on aquatic molluscs {{of the free}} flowing part of the Elbe River between Hřensko and the <b>weir</b> <b>with</b> <b>lock</b> in Ústí nad Labem – Střekov. Altogether, 21 species of aquatic molluscs (9 gastropods, 12 bivalves) were found in 2009. Viviparus viviparus, Potamopyrgus antipodarum, Bithynia tentaculata, Ancylus fluviatilis, Unio pictorum, Anodonta anatina, Corbicula fluminea, Sphaerium corneum and Pisidium supinum were the most frequently occurring molluscs found during this research. The occurrence of two endangered bivalves Pseudanodonta complanata and Pisidium moitessierianum was recorded. No significant difference from the previous author’s research was found. Molluscan communities {{of this part of}} the river were compared with those of the upper canalized part of the Elbe River which contain more species (especially gastropods) living predominantly in stagnant or slowly flowing waters e. g. Stagnicola palustris, S. corvus, Lymnaea stagnalis, Planorbis planorbis, Bathyomphalus contortus, Anisus vortex, Hippeutis complanatus, Ferrissia fragilis...|$|R

50|$|The Cannelton Locks and Dam is a {{concrete}} fixed <b>weir</b> dam <b>with</b> two <b>locks</b> on the Ohio River, {{on the border}} between the U.S. states of Indiana and Kentucky. The dam is 2 mi southeast of Cannelton, Indiana. Construction of the locks began in July 1963. The locks began operation in December 1966 and were completed April 1967. Construction on the dam started in August 1965 and the dam was completed in 1974. The structure was designed, built, and is operated by the United States Army Corps of Engineers Louisville District.|$|R
50|$|The Seine River was {{the scene}} of many early {{experiments}} withsteam navigation. The steamship has a long ancestry, dating back at least to 1783 when the Marquis de Jouffray d'Abbans steamed his little boat, the Pyroscaphe, across the Seine. Robert Fulton even exhibited one toNapoleon's regime. With the success of the steam engine by the1820s, the Second Republic embarked on a series of navigationimprovements to raise <b>weirs</b> and <b>locks</b> <b>with</b> which to deepen the navigation channel. By the 1860s improvements had changed the riverbed from low-lying sand banks and trickle to a series of cascadingponds with a depth of 6 and a half feet.|$|R
50|$|In 1803, Hirschhorn {{came into}} the {{possession}} of the Grand Duchy of Hesse-Darmstadt, and the monastery was dissolved once again. From 1821 to 1832 Hirschhorn was an administrative district of its own, then it {{became part of the}} district of Heppenheim, and from 1848 to 1852 it belonged to the district of Erbach. There were skirmishes between revolutionaries and Federal troops in and around Hirschhorn in 1849 in connection with the revolution of 1848/49 in Baden. In 1852 Hirschhorn was joined to the district of Lindenfels, and in 1856 it returned to the district of Heppenheim, which later became the district of Bergstraße. Steam navigation on the Neckar was introduced in 1841 and meant a moderate economic upturn. Horse-drawn barges finally disappeared from the river in 1878, when a seventy-mile-long chain was put on the river bed on which tugs could pull themselves upstream or downstream. A lot of bargemen became redundant and lost their jobs. The Neckar Valley Railway started to operate, connecting Hirschhorn with Heidelberg and Mosbach. The railway station was built outside the historical precinct of the town in the direction of Neckarsteinach, thus providing an incentive for further expansion of the town in this direction. On the Neckar, a <b>weir</b> <b>with</b> a <b>lock</b> and a bridge were completed in 1933. A second lock was added in 1959. The bridge linked Hirschhorn and Ersheim, which had been practically deserted centuries before; so as early as in the 1930s a few houses and a new school for Hirschhorn (which was enlarged in 1970) were built on the left bank.|$|R
2500|$|Although the River Derwent {{had been}} used for {{transport}} from the Trent since ancient times, it was winding and shallow in many places, silting frequently. The right {{to use it for}} navigation was conferred upon the citizens of Derby by King John in 1204. The engineer George Sorocold was involved with plans for improvements, although it is uncertain whether he was involved in the actual work. Plans had been first proposed in 1664, and bills had been presented to Parliament in 1696 and 1698. In 1703, Sorocold attended Parliament to give evidence for a scheme which involved four new cuts, <b>with</b> <b>weirs</b> and <b>locks,</b> on a [...] stretch of the river. The bill failed, but the map for a similar scheme presented in 1717 was said to be drawn by Sorocold. This became the Derwent Navigation Act in 1720, and the work enabled boats to reach Derby in January 1721, but it was still difficult to navigate in periods of flood or dry weather. Indeed the Trent itself was little better.|$|R

40|$|Weirs {{may be used}} {{to control}} the discharge, {{decrease}} the water slope in canals and to distribute water between canals for irrigation, etc. The objective of this research was to investigate the influence of using one opening or more in weirs on discharge coefficient (Cd), the hydraulic jump characteristics and velocity distribution downstream of these structures. This study is based on an experimental program. Three cases of openings arrangements were included, one, two and three openings. Different diameters of openings (D) and different heights from the bed (Z) were tested. The experiments showed that decreasing (D/Z) for weirs which have the same openings numbers and diameters decreases the discharge coefficient (Cd) and the ratio between the length of the submerged hydraulic jump (Lj) and the water tail depth (yt). Also, decreasing (D/Z) leads to make the maximum velocity near the bed tends to be lifted upward. Moreover, Comparing <b>weirs</b> <b>with</b> different openings numbers but have the same openings area leads to that, <b>weirs</b> <b>with</b> one opening have a bigger (Cd) than <b>weirs</b> <b>with</b> two or three openings but the maximum velocity near the bed of the <b>weir</b> <b>with</b> three openings is less than that with one opening. Also, the hydraulic jump length downstream <b>weir</b> <b>with</b> three openings is less than that downstream <b>weir</b> <b>with</b> one opening. Finally, equations were developed to deduce the value of the coefficient of discharge for the composite structure...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMany {{standard}} weirs in Fayoum district (Egypt) {{have been}} perforated by 1, 2 or 3 pipes, to convey much {{water in the}} downstream direction. Measurements of discharge with these structures are complicated due to existence of the openings. In this research, an experimental study was carried out to investigate the flow over clear over fall <b>weir</b> <b>with</b> bottom circular opening. Nine <b>weir</b> models <b>with</b> different heights were tested in a horizontal laboratory flume. Three weir heights were used with each one, three pipes with different diameters were tested. The results of the flow over the <b>weir</b> <b>with</b> a circular opening were {{compared with those of}} the weir without an opening having the same dimensions. It was found that there is a large difference between them. Multiple regression equations based on energy principal and dimensional analysis theory were developed for computing the discharge over clear over fall <b>weir</b> <b>with</b> a bottom opening...|$|R
