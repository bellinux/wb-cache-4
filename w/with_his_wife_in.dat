5|$|In May 1948, {{while he}} was holding church {{meetings}} throughout Navajo and Apache communities in Arizona, Kimball suffered severe chest pain from a myocardial infarction, {{also known as a}} heart attack, after he had spent an afternoon struggling to lift an automobile out of deep sand. Kimball was physically sluggish {{throughout the rest of the}} trip, and after he had returned to Salt Lake City and undergone an electrocardiogram, his physician prescribed one month of rest from his church duties. Kimball was only 53 and had considered himself to be generally healthy and fit; he persuaded his physician not to tell the other apostles or the First Presidency. However, on his next assignment, in Rigby, Idaho, Kimball again experienced chest pains, which escalated into another heart attack several days after his return. During the early episodes, Kimball passed the time by discussing his wishes regarding the family's finances and investments <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>in</b> case he did not survive the infarctions. After receiving a priesthood blessing from church president George Albert Smith, Kimball spent two months on bed rest followed by two weeks resting on the Navajo Nation. At his physician's urging, he spent several additional weeks recuperating with his wife near the seashore in Long Beach, California. A cardiologist that Kimball consulted in California believed that his heart had been weakened by an undiagnosed case of rheumatic fever during childhood and instructed Kimball to avoid overwork and gaining unnecessary weight.|$|E
5|$|Though {{sentenced to}} six years in prison, Francisco Rafael was {{released}} on 4 March 2008 {{after a year and}} five months behind bars. His lawyer confirmed that he was released for the time he had previously served in Mexico. Once released, he was deported to Mexico through the Paso del Norte International Bridge ("Santa Fe") international bridge in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, and El Paso, Texas. He had no pending charges in his home country. Mexican authorities watched Francisco Rafael from a distance as he merged through the multitude of people close to the border. It was unknown if his family was notified of his deportation but the authorities allege that shortly after his arrival he took a flight to Tijuana to see his wife and children. Upon his arrival, Francisco Rafael moved to Mazatlán before deciding to move to Los Cabos, a resort town in the Baja California peninsula.
