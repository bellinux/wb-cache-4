5|$|After the season, disaffection {{within the}} Southern Conference {{prompted}} seven former members, including Maryland, {{to form the}} Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). The schism <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>in</b> part to the ban on bowl participation, and the vast geographic dispersion of and disparity between the sizes of member schools. Clemson, another founding ACC member, had likewise been forced to play outside the Southern Conference in 1952.|$|E
5|$|At {{no point}} during The Wrath of Khan are Khan and Kirk {{in the same}} location; they {{speak to each other}} only over {{communication}} links such as view screens. This <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>in</b> part {{to the fact that the}} set of the Reliant was a redress of the Enterprise bridge, and the two actors' scenes were filmed four months apart. Montalbán recited his lines with a script assistant instead of to William Shatner.|$|E

5|$|In 1956, Ford {{tried to}} revive the Continental brand as a {{standalone}} line of ultra luxury automobiles, but abandoned the attempt after the 1957 model year, by which time around 3000 Mark II cars had been built. The failure <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>in</b> part to the price tag of $9695, {{an extraordinary amount of}} money for the time. The Continental thereafter became a successful car model under Ford's Lincoln brand.|$|E
5|$|Parachutes was {{recognised}} to have {{an alternative}} rock sound similar to English band Radiohead in their Bends era. In fact, {{it has been suggested}} that the album's commercial success <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>in</b> part to a portion of Radiohead's audience being alienated by the band's experimental and more electronic-influenced Kid A album.|$|E
5|$|The {{high rate}} of test animal {{survival}} <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>in</b> part {{to the nature of}} single-pulse radiation. As with the two Los Alamos criticality accidents involving the earlier demon core, victims who were close enough to receive a lethal dose died, while those farther away recovered and survived. Also, all the mice were placed outside the expected lethal zone in order to study possible mutations in future generations.|$|E

Executive producer Bob Weinstein blamed the pushed back release dates on budgetary concerns. To help promote The Brothers Grimm, a three-minute film trailer was shown at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival, while twenty minutes of footage was shown at the 2005 event.|$|E
5|$|The {{skirmish}} {{itself had}} no notable effect on {{relations between the}} people and the occupying Americans, which were already deteriorating as the siege dragged on. This <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>in</b> part {{to the fact that the}} Americans, rather than paying for their supplies in coin, paid with Continental paper currency or promissory notes, deemed to be of little worth by the locals.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} four medals were won, one gold, two silver and one bronze. UK Athletics {{performance}} director Dave Collins stood down after the Games. This <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>in</b> part to the team's failure to meet the UK Sport target of winning five medals,. Ironically, a series of retests ordered {{in the wake of}} the Russian doping scandal in 2015 and 2016 found that Great Britain athletes had been deprived of medals in a further four events by athletes later confirmed to have doped – the women's heptathlon (Kelly Sotherton), the men's and women's 4 x 400-metre relay teams and women's javelin (Goldie Sayers). When these medals are redistributed, Great Britain's 2008 athletics total of eight medals will be its most successful since the second world war, and 75% over target.|$|E

5|$|As a Republican {{representing}} heavily-Democratic Maryland, Mathias faced {{a potentially}} difficult re-election {{bid for the}} 1974 election. State Democrats nominated Barbara Mikulski, then a Baltimore City Councilwoman who was well-known to residents in her city as a social activist, but with limited name recognition {{in the rest of}} the state. Mathias was renominated by Republicans, fending off a primary election challenge from conservative doctor Ross Pierpont. Pierpont was never a substantial threat to Mathias, whose lack of competition <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>in</b> part to fallout from the Watergate scandal.|$|E
5|$|Being There is {{the second}} studio album by the American {{alternative}} rock band Wilco, released on October 29, 1996 by Reprise Records. Despite its release as a double album, Being There was sold at a single album price {{as a result of}} a deal between lead singer Jeff Tweedy and the band's label Reprise Records. The album was an improvement for the band in both sales and critical reception, in contrast to their debut album A.M. (1995). Taking its name from the 1979 film of the same name, the self-produced album featured more surrealistic and introspective writing than on A.M.. This <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>in</b> part to several significant changes in Tweedy's life, including the birth of his first child. Musically, it juxtaposed the alternative country styles songs reminiscent of Uncle Tupelo with psychedelic, surreal songs. It was the only Wilco album with steel guitarist Bob Egan, and their last with multi-instrumentalist Max Johnston.|$|E
5|$|Dick Harp was in {{the midst}} of his first season as head coach of the Kansas Jayhawks as the team entered the National Championship game. Kansas came into the season favored to win the {{national}} title. This <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>in</b> large part to Wilt Chamberlain joining the varsity team after finishing his freshman year on the freshman team per NCAA rules. At the beginning of the season, the Jayhawks starting line up consisted of Seniors Gene Elstun, Maurice King, John Parker, Lew Johnson, and Sophomore Chamberlain. Ron Loneski replaced Johnson's spot in the starting line up during the season. Harp began the season with a man to man defense, but later switched to a zone in order to give them an advantage in rebounding the basketball.|$|E

5|$|He {{attended}} Columbia University, {{where he}} received a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics in 1945 and, eleven years later, his PhD in economics in 1956. The delay in receiving his PhD <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>in</b> part to conflict with his advisor, Joseph Dorfman, and in part to Arthur Burns rejecting his doctoral dissertation. Burns was {{a longtime friend of}} the Rothbard family and their neighbor at their Manhattan apartment building. It was only after Burns went on leave from the Columbia faculty to head President Eisenhower's Council of Economic Advisors that Rothbard's thesis was accepted and he received his doctorate. Rothbard later stated that all of his fellow students there were extreme leftists and {{that he was one of}} only two Republicans on the Columbia campus at the time.|$|E
5|$|Historian Nancy Bristow {{has argued}} that the pandemic, when {{combined}} with the increasing number of women attending college, contributed to the success of women in the field of nursing. This <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>in</b> part to the failure of medical doctors, who were predominantly men, to contain and prevent the illness. Nursing staff, who were predominantly women, felt more inclined to celebrate the success of their patient care and less inclined to identify the spread of the disease with their own work.|$|E
5|$|In September 1933, Bruce was {{appointed}} by Lyons to replace the ailing Sir Granville Ryrie as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, giving him ambassadorial rank. He formally resigned from parliament on 7 October 1933. Bruce would excel in the new post, becoming a trusted confidant among Conservative politicians and a familiar face in British government circles, which led to him at one point considering entering British politics formally. Bruce was particularly close to Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, with whom he frequently consulted, and was notably influential in pressing for Edward VIII's abdication in 1936. His importance and power in London <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>in</b> part to the free rein that Lyons gave him a rarity {{in the history of}} the position. Combined with the turmoil and frequent ministerial changes within the Commonwealth Department of External Affairs, Bruce was generally credited as Australia's most influential and credible international representative during his posting, often determining matters of foreign policy in his own right.|$|E
