The {{remaining}} space was used for a pad on which the relief pilot slept. The right cabin door was replaced with an easy-opening, accordion-type door to allow supplies and fuel to be hoisted aboard. Early in the flight, the engine-driven electric generator failed. A Champion <b>wind-driven</b> <b>generator</b> (turned by a small propeller) was hoisted aboard, taped to the wing support strut, and plugged into the cigarette lighter socket; it served as the aircraft's source of electricity {{for the rest of the}} flight. The pilots decided to end the marathon flight because with 1,558 hours of continuously running the engine during the record-setting flight, plus several hundred hours already on the engine beforehand (considerably in excess of its normal overhaul interval), the engine's power output had deteriorated to the point at which they were barely able to climb away after refueling. The aircraft is on display in the passenger terminal at McCarran International Airport. Photos and details of the record flight can be seen in a small museum on the upper level of the baggage claim area. After the flight, Cook said: Next time I feel in the mood to fly endurance, I'm going to lock myself in our garbage can with the vacuum cleaner running.

5000|$|Russia had {{a chance}} to become the birthplace of the first multi-passenger and multi-engine airliner. The Ilya Muromets was first {{conceived}} and built as a luxurious aircraft. For the first time in aviation history, it had an insulated passenger saloon, comfortable wicker chairs, a bedroom, a lounge and even the first airborne toilet. The aircraft also had heating and electrical lighting. [...] The S-22 cockpit had sufficient space allowing several persons to observe the pilot. Openings {{on both sides of the}} fuselage permitted mechanics to climb out onto the lower wings to service the engines during flight. A hatch on the left side provided an entry to the main cabin, behind the cockpit. The main cabin featured two large windows on each side. Further back was a private cabin which included a berth, small table and a cabinet. Lighting was provided by a <b>wind-driven</b> <b>generator</b> and heating was supplied by two long engine exhaust pipes which passed through the corners of the cabin. Despite many advancements, the flight instruments on the Ilya Muromets were primitive. They included four tachometers, one per engine, a compass, a crude altimeter and airspeed indicator, two glass V-shaped tubes and a ball for bank indication, and a series of horizontal bars situated vertically on the nose of the fuselage for measuring climbs and descents. Later, in the bomber variants, a drift indicator and elementary bombsight was added to aid bombing.|$|E

40|$|A {{stator flux}} {{oriented}} {{synchronous reference frame}} - phase locked loop (SRF-PLL) is proposed for the precise computation of rotor speed and position of permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM). A direct method of rotational speed computation based on the stator electromotive force (EMF) is initially formulated. Using the speed as a reference to the inverse Park and Clarke transformation blocks, the three-phase positive sequence stator flux is derived. A pre-stage low pass filter (LPF) is implemented to cancel out the ripples in the d-q components of the stator flux introduced by the dynamic operating conditions of inverter non-linearities and grid disturbances. The estimated three-phase positive sequence stator flux is used to compute the rotor position by aligning the total stator flux along the direct axis through a PLL block. Provision of the frequency amendment and ripple cancellation outside the PLL block results in a fast-dynamic response with an enhanced frequency adaptable capability. To validate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed method, the sensorless vector control of grid integrated PMSM based <b>wind-driven</b> <b>generator</b> (WG) is analytically verified using the PSCAD/EMTDC simulation tool under various dynamic operating conditions such as wind speed variation and grid disturbances...|$|E

The measurement of core losses of the electrical steel laminations in Epstein Frame is implemented step by step from 50 Hz to 5000 Hz.

The core loss database for three different kinds of medium, medium-high and high quality electrical steel laminations (50 CS 350, 50 CS 470, 50 CS 600) is completed in the paper. Also, 85 test points of core loss data are established in the flux density ranging from 0. 3 T to 1. 8 T and in the power supply frequency ranging from 50 Hz to 5000 Hz.

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} a calculation procedure of application efficiency of wind-diesel complexes {{in the rural}} electric supply system. Electrical capacity of a wind-powered generator (wind turbine) depends upon the air flow rate through the wind-wheel plane and is determined {{on the basis of}} weather data supplied by the nearest meteorological station. Under sufficient wind flow the wind turbine takes over a part of electrical load thus allowing for lower diesel fuel consumption and for disengagement of several diesel generators. The number and capacity of wind turbines are chosen according to the current electrical loads and parallel operation with diesel generators. The main aim of wind turbine application within the wind-diesel systems is diesel fuel economy. The fuel amount saved under the given power of the <b>wind-driven</b> <b>generator</b> depends upon the average annual wind speed {{at the height of the}} wind-wheel axis. Yearly economic effect of wind turbines is calculated by multiplying the annual energy output by the fuel factor in the prime cost of one kWh of electric energy with due account of the yearlong maintenance costs. The presented calculation procedure is verified by the fact that application of wind-driven power plants allows for diesel fuel economy. Other prime cost factors, such as auxiliary energy of diesel power stations, line losses, repair and maintenance costs are unaffected by the presence or absence of a wind turbine in the system. The presented procedure has been tested when designing an autonomous electric supply system for a settlement in the Arkhangelsk Oblast.

An output feedback linear quadratic controller is designed for the static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) and the variable blade pitch in a wind energy conversion system (WECS) {{in order to reach}} the voltage and mechanical power control under both grid-connection and islanding conditions. A two-reference-frame model is proposed to decouple the STATCOM real and reactive power control loops for the output feedback controller.
