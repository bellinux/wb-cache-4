5|$|Several highly lethal viral {{pathogens}} {{are members}} of the Filoviridae. Filoviruses are filament-like viruses that cause viral hemorrhagic fever, and include ebolaviruses and marburgviruses. Marburg virus, first discovered in 1967, attracted widespread press attention in April 2005 for an outbreak in Angola. Ebola Virus Disease has also caused intermittent outbreaks with high mortality rates since 1976 <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>first</b> identified. The worst and most recent one is the West Africa epidemic.|$|E
5|$|Steep was {{not likely}} settled {{until late in}} the Anglo-Saxon period <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>first</b> {{documented}} under the name of 'Stepe Place' in the 12th century. The church of All Saints was built around 1125, and the oldest surviving dwelling in the village dates from the late 16th century, which lies opposite the church. In the early medieval period, Steep was included as a 'sub-parish' of East Meon.|$|E

5|$|Adults have {{extremely}} variable lifespans, from {{weeks to}} years, {{depending on the}} species. Some wood-boring beetles can have extremely long life-cycles. It is believed that when furniture or house timbers are infested by beetle larvae, the timber already contained the larvae <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>first</b> sawn up. A birch bookcase 40 years old released adult Eburia quadrigeminata (Cerambycidae), while Buprestis aurulenta and other Buprestidae have been documented as emerging as much as 51 years after manufacture of wooden items.|$|E
5|$|Although Jupiter {{would need}} to be about 75 times as massive to fuse {{hydrogen}} and become a star, the smallest red dwarf is only about 30 percent larger in radius than Jupiter. Despite this, Jupiter still radiates more heat than it receives from the Sun; the amount of heat produced inside it is similar to the total solar radiation it receives. This additional heat is generated by the Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism through contraction. This process causes Jupiter to shrink by about 2cm each year. <b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>first</b> formed, Jupiter was much hotter and was about twice its current diameter.|$|E

5|$|As {{the oldest}} parts of Monte Testaccio {{are at the}} bottom of the mound, it is {{difficult}} to say with any certainty <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>first</b> created. Deposits found by excavators have been dated to a period between approximately AD 140 to 250, but it is possible that dumping could have begun on the site as early as the 1st century BC. The mound has a roughly triangular shape comprising two distinct platforms, the eastern side being the oldest. At least four distinct series of terraces were built in a stepped arrangement. Layers of small sherds were laid down in some places, possibly to serve as paths for those carrying out the waste disposal operations.|$|E
5|$|BBRC reviews 1200 to 1500 records {{each year}} (<b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>first</b> set up, {{the figure was}} around 200 per year). Of these, {{approximately}} 85% are accepted: this acceptance rate has remained steady for many years. Species that have caused particular problems include black kite, great snipe, gyrfalcon, gull-billed tern, and North Atlantic little shearwater. Peter Grant estimated that, during his tenure as chairman, approximately 2% of accepted records are incorrectly accepted, and 5% are incorrectly rejected.|$|E

As {{one of the first}} horror-themed video games, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre caused controversy <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>first</b> released due to its violent nature; it sold poorly as a result, because many game stores refused to stock it.|$|E

5|$|Like NY33 before it, NY441 officially {{ended at}} NY21 in Marion <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>first</b> assigned. By 1970, {{the east end}} of the route was moved to NY350 in Walworth. The change in NY441's {{alignment}} had no effect on the maintenance of the Walworth–Marion highway, however, as the Wayne County portion of NY441 was entirely county-maintained. On April1, 1980, ownership and maintenance of NY441 from the Monroe County line to NY350 was transferred from Wayne County to the state of New York as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. In return, the county received a part of NY21 in Williamson that connected to a state highway at only one end.|$|E
5|$|Seorsumuscardinus is a genus {{of fossil}} dormice {{from the early}} Miocene of Europe. It is known from zone MN 4 (see MN zonation) in Oberdorf, Austria; Karydia, Greece; and Tägernaustrasse-Jona, Switzerland, and from zone MN 5 in a single site at Affalterbach, Germany. The MN 4 records are placed in the species S.alpinus and the sole MN 5 record is {{classified}} as the species S.bolligeri. The latter {{was placed in a}} separate genus, Heissigia, <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>first</b> described in 2007, but it was reclassified as a second species of Seorsumuscardinus in 2009.|$|E
5|$|The Alcathoe bat (Myotis alcathoe) is a European bat in {{the genus}} Myotis. Known only from Greece and Hungary <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>first</b> {{described}} in 2001, its known distribution has since expanded to Spain, England, Sweden, and Azerbaijan, among other countries. It {{is similar to}} the whiskered bat (Myotis mystacinus) and other species and is difficult to distinguish from them. However, its brown fur is distinctive and it is clearly different in characters of its karyotype and DNA sequences. Although some genetic data suggest that it is related to Geoffroy's bat (Myotis emarginatus), other analyses do not support a close relationship between M.alcathoe and any other species.|$|E
5000|$|The Latin motto Quocunque Jeceris Stabit can be {{translated}} as [...] "whithersoever you throw it, it will stand", or [...] "whichever way you throw, it will stand".

50|$|The {{area around}} Steckborn was already {{inhabited}} {{in the second}} century.

50|$|Archeologists found {{remains of}} {{settlements}} from roughly 5000 BC.

The entire region was decimated during the 1241-42 Mongol invasion, and subsequently resettled by German winemakers.|$|R
5|$|The Cow Tower was {{deliberately}} designed to house gunpowder artillery <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>first</b> built, {{making it a}} very rare form of defensive structure for its time: the only equivalents in England are God's House Tower in Southampton, and the West Gate at Canterbury. The archaeologists Oliver Creighton and Robert Higham {{go so far as}} to consider the building to be unique within Britain, as God's House was an extension of an existing building, and the West Gate part of the city's walled circuit. The concept of an isolated artillery tower was more common in France, where they were used as temporary and permanent defensive features during the Hundred Years War between the English and the French kings.|$|E
5|$|The Marian {{government}} {{produced a}} pamphlet with all six recantations plus {{the text of}} the speech Cranmer was to have made in the University Church. His subsequent withdrawal of his recantations was not mentioned, though what actually happened soon became common knowledge, undermining the effectiveness of Marian propaganda. Similarly, the Protestant party had difficulty in making use of the event, given Cranmer's recantations. The exiles' propaganda concentrated on publishing various specimens of his writings. Eventually John Foxe put Cranmer's story to effective use in 1559, and it features prominently in his Acts and Monuments <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>first</b> printed in 1563.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Crescent is {{a row of}} 30 terraced houses {{laid out}} in a {{sweeping}} crescent in the city of Bath, England.
