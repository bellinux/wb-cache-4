40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to outline a {{proposed}} a new brackish <b>water</b> greenhouse <b>desalination</b> unit powered by geothermal energy for the development of arid and relatively cold regions, using Algeria as a case study. Countries which have abundant sea/brackish water resources and good geothermal conditions are ideal candidates for producing fresh water from sea/brackish water. The establishment of human habitats in these arid areas strongly depends on availability of fresh water. The main advantage of using geothermal energy to power brackish <b>water</b> greenhouse <b>desalination</b> units is that this renewable energy source can provide power 24 Â h a day. This resource is generally invariant with less intermittence problems compared to other renewable resources such as solar or wind energy. Geothermal resources can both be used to heat the greenhouses and to provide fresh water needed for irrigation of the crops cultivated inside the greenhouses. A review of the geothermal potential in the case study country is also outlined. Brackish <b>water</b> greenhouse <b>desalination</b> Geothermal energy Algeria Heating Renewable energy...|$|R
