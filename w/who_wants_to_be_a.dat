5|$|Renwick {{resisted}} the BBC's attempt to broadcast the episode at Christmas, feeling that such scheduling would contrast unfavourably with the grimness of the show, {{and would be}} viewed as an overt attempt to garner high ratings. The controller of BBC1 relented and the episode was first transmitted on BBC One on 20 November 2000. The broadcast coincided with the transmission of <b>Who</b> <b>Wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>a</b> Millionaire?s first UK jackpot win. Some people within the BBC alleged that Celador, the production company in charge of <b>Who</b> <b>Wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>a</b> Millionaire? had rigged Judith Keppel's victory to spoil the BBC's expected high ratings for the sitcom's finale. The Independent Television Commission (ITC) cleared Celador and ITV of any wrongdoing.|$|E
5|$|The story {{depicts a}} young student named Shuichi Nitori, {{described}} by the author as a transgender girl, and Shuichi's friend Yoshino Takatsuki, described as a transgender boy. The series deals with issues such as being transgender, gender identity, {{and the beginning of}} puberty. Shimura was originally going to write the story about a girl in high school <b>who</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> boy, but she realized that a boy <b>who</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> girl before entering into puberty would have a lot of worries related to growing up, and changed the story to fit this model. Wandering Son was selected as a recommended work by the awards jury of the tenth Japan Media Arts Festival in 2006. The series has been lauded for its use of gender reversal as the core of the story, though the emotional realism of the young characters has been called into question.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the genre}} began, many shows have offered prizes of {{large sums of}} money to contestants; Teddy Nadler set the {{original}} monetary winnings record of $264,000 during his appearance on The $64,000 Challenge in 1957.
