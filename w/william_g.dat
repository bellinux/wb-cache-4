5|$|A {{commemorative}} {{was wanted}} by the State of Illinois {{to mark the}} centennial of its 1818 admission to the Union, and in 1918, legislation was introduced into Congress to accomplish this.

5|$|Opening of {{the park}} were held on 23 May 1981, with Ontario Premier <b>William</b> <b>G.</b> Davis and Taft Broadcasting President Dudley Taft presiding. The ceremonies {{included}} four children, representing the Arctic, Pacific, Atlantic, and Great Lakes regions of Canada, each pouring a vial of water from their home regions into the park's fountain. Hockey superstar Wayne Gretzky also appeared as a special guest, helping to raise the Canadian flag on the bridge near the waterfall.|$|E
5|$|Realizing {{that the}} plains Indians {{would have no}} {{experience}} on water, the townspeople fled prudently from the Comanche raiders {{to the safety of}} the water. They were saved by remaining aboard small boats and a schooner captained by <b>William</b> <b>G.</b> Marshall, which was at anchor in the bay. While safe in the water, the refugees witnessed the destruction and looting of their town, unable to do a thing except curse them.|$|E
5|$|The North Korean {{aircraft}} {{split off}} into two groups, with two climbing rapidly into {{the clouds and}} the remaining three descending. Two F-82s piloted by Lieutenant Charles B. Moran (tail number 46-357) and Lieutenant <b>William</b> <b>G.</b> Hudson (tail number 46-383) followed the ascending pair. The two North Korean aircraft maneuvered around Moran's aircraft and opened fire, damaging the tail of his plane. Hudson responded by attacking the lead plane, forcing it to ascend further. Hudson's shots struck the aircraft in the fuselage and right wing.|$|E

5|$|A {{day after}} their victory over Birmingham High School, Alabama {{suffered}} their first all-time loss against the Birmingham Athletic Club (B.A.C.) 5–4. In a game noted for numerous fumbles by both squads, Alabama scored first {{and took a}} 4–0 lead on a <b>William</b> <b>G.</b> Little touchdown run {{late in the first}} half. However, the B.A.C. won the game 5–4 late in the second half when J. P. Ross successfully kicked a 63-yard field goal on a drop kick. Alabama would not lose another game by a single point until their 1947 game against Tulane.|$|E
5|$|After {{recovering}} from polio {{she moved to}} Salem, Oregon (the state's capitol), {{and worked as a}} legal secretary, including working for Oregon Supreme Court Chief Justices Earl C. Latourette and William M. McAllister. At this time Latourette recommended Paulus to attend law school, which she did at Willamette University without a college degree, enrolling in 1956. While in law school she met her future husband <b>William</b> <b>G.</b> Paulus. Norma Paulus graduated with honors from Willamette University College of Law in Salem with a LL.B. in 1962. Following law school Paulus worked in private practice until entering politics.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland Lakefront Station is an Amtrak {{train station}} at North Coast Harbor in Cleveland, Ohio. The station {{was built in}} 1977 to provide service to the Lake Shore Limited route, which was {{reinstated}} by Amtrak via Cleveland and Toledo in 1975. It replaced service to Cleveland Union Terminal. Lakefront Station is a modern station located in downtown Cleveland near the Lake Erie waterfront, adjacent to the Cleveland Memorial Shoreway and {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Great Lakes Science Center, the Steamship <b>William</b> <b>G.</b> Mather Museum, and FirstEnergy Stadium. The station has had little to no renovation since its opening.|$|E

5|$|In 1979, <b>William</b> <b>G.</b> Dyer became {{dean of the}} school. Dyer {{oversaw the}} {{construction}} of the N. Eldon Tanner Building, which was dedicated in 1982. In 1983, an Executive MBA program was added, and in 1984 Paul H. Thompson was appointed dean of the school. Two years later (1986), the International Student Sponsor Program was started, which continues to provide financial assistance to married LDS international students to this day. In 1988, the name of the school was changed to Marriott School of Management in honor of its benefactors—Marriott International founders J. Willard and Alice Marriott—following their $15million donation to the school. That same year, the Army and Air Force ROTC programs became a part of the Marriott School.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, {{research}} {{started in}} the Soviet Union and the US on the growth of diamond by pyrolysis of hydrocarbon gases at the relatively low temperature of 800°C. This low-pressure process is known as chemical vapor deposition (CVD). <b>William</b> <b>G.</b> Eversole reportedly achieved vapor deposition of diamond over diamond substrate in 1953, {{but it was not}} reported until 1962. Diamond film deposition was independently reproduced by Angus and coworkers in 1968 and by Deryagin and Fedoseev in 1970. Whereas Eversole and Angus used large, expensive, single-crystal diamonds as substrates, Deryagin and Fedoseev succeeded in making diamond films on non-diamond materials (silicon and metals), which led to massive research on inexpensive diamond coatings in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The {{conspiracy}} {{issue was}} ultimately addressed by <b>William</b> <b>G.</b> E. Wiseman, head of British {{intelligence in the}} United States, when he passed details of a bomb plot directly to the New York Police bypassing diplomatic channels. This led {{to the arrest of}} Chandra Kanta Chuckrevarty. As the links between Chuckervarty's papers and the Igel papers became apparent, investigations by federal authorities expanded to cover the entire conspiracy. Ultimately, the United States agreed to forward evidence so long as Britain did not seek admission of liability for breaches of neutrality. At a time that diplomatic relations with Germany were deteriorating, the British Foreign Office directed its embassy to co-operate with the investigations resolving the Anglo-American diplomatic disputes just as the United States entered the war.|$|E

5|$|Widgiemoolthalite {{was first}} found at 132 North, a nickel deposit near Widgiemooltha, Western Australia. Blair J. Gartrell {{collected}} the holotype widgiemoolthalite specimen from a stockpile of secondary minerals at the site. The mineral {{was discovered in}} 1992 and was first reported in American Mineralogist in 1993 by Ernest H. Nickel, Bruce W. Robinson, and <b>William</b> <b>G.</b> Mumme, when it received its name for its type locality. Widgiemoolthalite's existence was confirmed and name {{was approved by the}} Commission on New Minerals and Mineral Names of the International Mineralogical Association the same year. The holotype specimen was stored in Perth's Western Australian Museum.|$|E
5|$|Freeway {{construction}} {{continued through}} the 1970s. On April 6, 1972, the New Buffalo Welcome Center was relocated from its previous location next to US12 to one adjacent to I-94. Later that year, the state switched paint colors for its centerlines; yellow {{was used for the}} lines separating directions of travel and white for lines separating lanes traveling in the same direction. Also in 1972, a gas tax increase was passed to facilitate US and state highway improvement projects. The final section of I-75 between Alger and Roscommon was opened on November 1, 1973, in a dedication by Governor <b>William</b> <b>G.</b> Milliken, completing the longest highway in the state. In 1974, the state implemented mileage-based exit numbers along the remaining Interstates in Michigan. By late 1977, the state highway department shifted its focus from construction of new highways to improvements of the existing system.|$|E
5|$|More recently, a 2007 {{analysis}} by paleontologist <b>William</b> <b>G.</b> Parker {{resulted in a}} larger tree of aetosaur phylogenetics with the inclusion of Heliocanthus. Based on the tree, Parker defined the clades Typothoracisinae and Paratypothoracisini, both within Aetosaurinae. Parker also gave a revised phylogenetic definition of Aetosauria, mentioning that the previous definition, made by Heckert and Lucas in 2000, was somewhat ambiguous. Heckert & Lucas (2000) defined Aetosauria as a stem-based taxon, claiming that Aetosauria included all crurotarsans that were {{more closely related to}} Desmatosuchus than to the immediate sister group of Aetosauria. Because the immediate sister group of Aetosauria was uncertain, Parker offered a new definition with several non-aetosaur crurotarsan genera rather than one sister group. According to Parker, Aetosauria included all taxa more closely related to Aetosaurus and Desmatosuchus than to Leptosuchus, Postosuchus, Prestosuchus, Poposaurus, Sphenosuchus, Alligator, Gracilisuchus, and Revueltosaurus.|$|E
