40|$|In {{this thesis}} the dynamic air cushion {{pressure}} inside suction anchors during low- ering through the splash zone has been studied. A non-linear continuity equation {{for the air}} mass is used to establish a theoretical model for the dynamic air cush- ion pressure. Buoyancy forces due to dynamic air cushion pressure inside the suction anchors are calculated until the wave elevation inside the suction anchor reach the top. At impact <b>Wagner</b> <b>s</b> wedge <b>method</b> together with Von Karman s wetted length {{is used to calculate}} the impact force on the cone-shaped suction anchor top. Important parameters aﬀecting the dynamic air cushion pressure and thus the buoyancy forces have been investigated. Force measured in lifting wire during splash zone transition of a single suction anchor is used as basis for comparison. The parameters that are investigated are introduction of a time-varying lowering velocity, changing characteristics of the ventilation hatch outlet and introducing regular and irregular waves. By varying these parameters a best-ﬁt comparison with 2. 5 [%] deviation between calculations and measurements have been ob- tained. Further, a comparison between theoretical calculations and force measurements from a lifting operation of a subsea structure with suction anchors as foundation has been performed. The buoyancy forces calculated prior to impact are due to the dynamic air cushion pressure alone. The total force in the lifting wire for this phase are corresponding well to the magnitude of the measured force. During this comparison the eﬀect of changing perforation ratio clearly show an increase of buoyancy forces for decreasing size of ventilation hatch. Including both inﬂow and outﬂow of air from the suction anchors when oscillating in large waves have also been studied. When comparing with force measurements the im- portance of including both inﬂow and outﬂow of air to account for both suction and compressive pressure has been shown. This lead to negative and positive buoyancy forces respectively. Long crested waves accounting for wind and swell sea are calculated with the JONSWAP- and Torsethaugen-spectra. By using empirical formulas for the lim- iting case between wind and swell sea it is shown that wind sea is the dominating part for the sea state measured during splash zone transition of the suction an- chors. Using <b>Wagner</b> <b>s</b> wedge model together with Von Karman s wetted length for cal- culating impact force on a ﬂat suction anchor top is also performed. Impact forces with impact angles in the range of 5 - 15 degrees between the wedge-shaped water and top overestimate the force compared with measurements. A best-ﬁt for the impact forces with the measurements has been obtained with deadrise angle of 17. 5 [deg] in addition to impact forces calculated with a time-varying slamming coeﬃcient. Possible resonant phenomena connected with oscillations of suction anchor and pressure measurements at impact have been studied. Simpliﬁed models for cal- culating A) natural period of oscillating air cushion, B) piston mode of water column and C) coupled piston mode of air cushion and water column has been developed. These have been compared with oscillation-period of pressure mea- surements observed after impact of a single suction anchor. These calculations have also been compared with oscillations of the suction anchor observed from videos of experiment. Case B) proved to give the most similar results with the suction anchor oscillations while case A) and C) were not in the proximity of the observed oscillations. This showed that the air cushion were not causing any resonant motion. Using a common safety criterion for avoiding slack in lifting wire, the calculation model have been used to give a recommendation for perforation ratios for the suction anchors used on the installation of the subsea structure studied here. Perforation ratios in the range 1 - 3 [%] used on suction anchor with diameters in the range 3 - 6 [m] proved to be well within the slack-wire limit. When using the theoretical model developed in this thesis a design recommen- dation for using ventilation hatches with a certain height have been made. Also uniform hatches are advised to ensure as similar conditions as possible for outﬂow and inﬂow of air...|$|R
40|$|The {{transposition}} of the Great Man {{into the}} Fittest Survivor {{is at the}} very root of an endemic interchange between the sciences and the arts in late Victorian culture, giving rich metaphoric substance to more heavily concretised scientific terminology. Herbert Spencer s famous phrase, survival of the fittest is, arguably, one of the most commonly transposed and consequently influential scientific expressions of the Victorian period, and as such, one of its most malleable idioms. In Victorian musicology this influence is especially obvious in biographical works which privilege Richard Wagner as the greatest genius of musical history. Thus in Mezzotints in Modern Music (1899) James Huneker declares that Wagner carried within his breast the precious eucharist of genius. It is the attitude of Huneker and like-minded musicologists, like C. Hubert H. Parry, William Wallace, Francis Hueffer and Richard Wallaschek, which forms the basis of a three-part exploration of <b>Wagner</b> <b>s</b> genius, covering (1) the role of endurance in Victorian definitions of genius, from Carlyle and Sully to Galton; (2) the influence of German morphology on evolutionary terminology in Britain, with particular reference to ontogeny, phylogeny and recapitulation; and (3) Spencer s adaptation of German morphology and his influence on Victorian perceptions of <b>Wagner</b> <b>s</b> genius. These collectively argue through the paradigm of Wagner that the formulation of late Victorian musical genius was incomplete without recourse to evolutionary terminology of survival. Indeed, for Victorian musicology, Wagner, the Great Man, had evolved into Wagner, the Fittest Survivor...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, an Improved Fourier Five-Sensor (IF 5 <b>S)</b> {{measurement}} <b>method</b> {{is proposed}} for separating the straightness and yawing motion errors {{as well as}} determining {{the profile of a}} linear slide.

Here, the improved F 5 <b>S</b> <b>method</b> applies the least square regression technique instead of the iterative method to estimate the profile functions by using three distinct sets of parameters and different fused sensor data according to the travel of the linear slide.

40|$|I {{thought it}} is of the first {{importance}} to the reserch of carbohydrate metabolism to select a standard micro analytical method of glucose, since it is frequently needed, {{in the case of}} biological study, to perform the experiments with a small quantity of sample. From this view point the experiments were carried out and the results may be summarised as follows :- 1) Glucose was determined in a pure glucose solution, blood, and artificial mixed solutions by the methods of Benedict, Folin-Wu, Folin, Hagedorn, Shaffer-Hartmann, and Bang, among which the former three are colorirnetric methods and the latter three titration methods. 2) In the case of pure glucose solution, it was found that all the methods afford correct results at their standard concentration, but they show more or less errors when the concentration is deviated from the standard. Among the methods examined, Hagedorn 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>method</b> showed the smallest amount of error. 3) Benedict 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>method</b> requires the largest quantity of sample for determination and Bang 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>method</b> the smallest. 4) The treatment of the colorimetric methods is generally simple but that of the titration methods more complex. 5) When blood was used as a sample, Bang 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>method</b> afforded the smallest result of sugar and Benedict method the lafgest, the order being as follows Benedict > Folin-Wu > Hagedorn > Folin > Shaffer-Hartmann > Bang 6) The results obtained in the mixed solutions were as follows :? a) Every method is effected by the addition of cystine in the samples, the effect being the largest in Bang 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>method.</b> b) The addition of sodium sulfide g ives too high results in Folin-Wu 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>method</b> but too low results in Bang 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>method.</b> Other methods are little effected. c) The addition of sodium phosphate gives too low results in Benedict 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>method</b> but shows little influence upon the other methods examined. 7) From the results of experiments I {{came to the conclusion that}} Hagedorn 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>method</b> is the most reliable. 1) BENEDICT, FOLIN-WU, SHAFFER-HARTMANN, BANG 及び HAGEDORN の各方法を用ゐて純葡萄糖溶液, 血液, 及人工混合溶液に於て葡萄糖を定量したり。 2) 純葡萄椿溶液に於ける實驗に依れば何れの方法も標準濃度の砂糖を含有する場合には正確なる價を與ふるも標準濃度以外に於ては何れも多少の誤差は免れず但し HAGEDORN-JENSEN 法は最も誤差少なるが如し。 3) 所要供試料の最少なるは BANG 法にして最大なるは BENEDICT 法なり。 4) 一般に比色法は操作簡單にして滴定法は複雜なり。 5) 血液に於て行ぴたる定量結果は BANG 法は最小にして BENEDICT 法は最大なりき其の順位は BANG < SHAFFER-HARTMANN = FOLIN < HAGEDORM < FOLIN-WU < BENEDICT 6) Cystin の添加に依りて何れの方法も影響を被る其の影響の頗る大なるは BANG 法なり。 7) 硫化曹達の添加は FOLIN-WU の方法に過大なる結果を生じ BANG の方法には過少なる結果を與ふ他の方法には影響殆んどなし。 8) 燐酸曹達の添加は BENEDICT 法に過少なる結果を與へ他の方法には多少の影響あり。 9) HAGEDORN-JENSEN の方法は Cystin 及鹽類の影響を被る事比較的少に最良法と考ふる事を得べし...|$|R
