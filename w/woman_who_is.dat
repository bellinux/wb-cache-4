40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} rate of early (first trimester) and late (second and third trimester) fetal loss in <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> factor V Leiden homozygous. METHODS: Between December 1995 and February 2007, consecutive, {{unrelated}} white <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> factor V Leiden homozygous and <b>who</b> had <b>been</b> pregnant at least once were recruited from 10 French hemostasis units. For reasons of comparison, we included <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> factor V Leiden heterozygous {{and a group of}} noncarriers. The frequency of early and late fetal loss was assessed retrospectively and compared among the three groups. The effect of concomitant thrombophilic abnormalities was evaluated. The overall pregnancy outcome was reported. RESULTS: We analyzed 240 thromboprophylaxis-free pregnancies in 95 <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> factor V Leiden homozygous, 425 in 195 <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> factor V Leiden heterozygous, and 182 in 73 <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> noncarriers. The risk of late fetal loss <b>was</b> higher in <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> homozygous (13 / 95, 13. 7 %) compared with those <b>who</b> <b>were</b> noncarriers (1 / 73, 1. 4 %, odds ratio 11. 41, 95 % confidence interval 1. 46 - 89. 46, P=. 002), whereas it <b>was</b> similar in <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> heterozygous and in noncarriers (6 / 195, 3. 1 % compared with 1 / 73, 1. 4 %, P=. 68). The percentage of women with early fetal loss was similar in the three groups (P=. 81). The live-birth rate was 80 %, 84 %, and 85 %, respectively, for <b>women</b> <b>who</b> where homozygous, heterozygous, and noncarriers (P=. 88). CONCLUSION: The factor V Leiden homozygous genotype increases the risk of late fetal loss. However, the overall likelihood of a positive outcome is high in our series of <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> homozygous. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III...|$|R

Tennyson's Mariana and Gaskell's main character, Ruth, are sensitive to the sounds around them and are constantly looking out of their window in image that represents their imprisonment within their homes. The image of Mariana used by Tennyson and the later works are equally of a <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> weary.|$|E

5|$|In teenagers, pregnancies are {{at greater}} risk of poor outcomes. Comprehensive sex {{education}} and access to birth control decreases the rate of unwanted pregnancies in this age group. While all forms of birth control can generally be used by young people, long-acting reversible birth control such as implants, IUDs, or vaginal rings are more successful in reducing rates of teenage pregnancy. After the delivery of a child, a <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> not exclusively breastfeeding may become pregnant again after as few as four to six weeks. Some methods of birth control can be started immediately following the birth, while others require a delay of up to six months. In women who are breastfeeding, progestin-only methods are preferred over combined oral birth control pills. In women who have reached menopause, it is recommended that birth control be continued for one year after the last period.|$|E
