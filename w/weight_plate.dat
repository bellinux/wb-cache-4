50|$|A <b>weight</b> <b>plate</b> is a flat, heavy object, {{usually made}} of cast iron, {{that is used}} in {{combination}} with barbells or dumbbells to produce a bar with a desired total weight {{for the purpose of}} physical exercise.|$|E
50|$|In a pinch grip, {{the fingers}} are {{on one side}} of an object, and the thumb is on the other. Typically, an object lifted in a pinch grip does not touch the palm. This is {{generally}} considered a weaker grip position. The pinch grip is used when grabbing something like a <b>weight</b> <b>plate</b> or lifting a sheet of plywood by the top edge. Care must be taken to avoid cramping the muscles in the hand.|$|E
50|$|Sissy squat - a squat {{with several}} sorts ({{dumbbell}}, <b>weight</b> <b>plate,</b> Smith machine, barbell, bodyweight). In {{the most common}} variant, a dumbbell is held behind the legs while the heels are {{lifted off the ground}} and the torso remains flat while the lifter leans backwards; sometimes done with a plate held on the chest and one arm holding onto a chair or beam for support. Unlike most other squat variations, Vince Gironda promoted sissy squat as a rectus femoris isolation exercise.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Weight</b> <b>Plates</b> BUR sold {{standard}} <b>weight</b> <b>plates</b> via mail-order {{and factory}} direct in Lyndhurst. BUR plates were shorter and thicker than competitor's plates were. This gave BUR plates {{the advantage of}} being virtually [...] "unbreakable". Unfortunately, the increased thickness also meant that fewer plates could fit on any given bar. BUR plates were offered only in American pounds; the metric system was never used for any BUR branded product.|$|R
5000|$|The BUR Numbering SystemAnother {{factor that}} {{distinguished}} BUR Barbell plates {{from those of}} other manufacturers {{was the use of}} a unique numbering system. From the late 1930s until the early 1960s, every BUR <b>weight</b> <b>plate</b> had a separate number - besides poundage - stamped into it. These numbers were meant to work with an exercise record keeping system designed by Dave Hall. [...] Even some of the plates that BUR manufactured for other barbell companies had these numbers stamped into them.|$|E
5000|$|Clash of the Champions XVI {{took place}} on September 5, 1991 at the Augusta-Richmond County Civic Center in Augusta, Georgia. There were 2,800 fans in {{attendance}} and the show drew a 3.7 rating on TBS. The Patriots defeated the Fabulous Freebirds to win the WCW United States Tag Team Championship on August 12, but the match didn't air yet, so the Freebirds were announced as the champions. Furthermore, the titles {{were not on the}} line, making it a non-title match. Larry Zbyszko pinned Bill Kazmaier. The titles were vacated on July 18, 1991, when one half of the reigning WCW World Tag Team Champions The Steiner Brothers, Scott Steiner, was injured. Steiner and Kazmaier defeated The Ringlords and One Man Gang and The Executioner to advance to the finals, while The Enforcers defeated The Young Pistols and The Patriots to advance to the finals. Earlier in the evening, Kazmaier was performing [...] "feats of strength" [...] in the ring when Anderson and Zbyszko attacked and injured his ribs with a <b>weight</b> <b>plate.</b> They exploited this injury during the actual match to gain the victory and the Tag Team Titles.|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the large}} volume {{consumption}} of polyolefins, {{the treatment of the}} resulting solid waste is becoming a major concern. One possible utilization of the polyolefin wastes is to form blends from recycled polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE). This study is a preliminary investigation on the impact fracture behaviour for the PP/PE blends. The impact testing method employed in this study includes the conventional and instrumented Izod impact tests, the instrumented Charpy impact test, and the instrumented drop <b>weight</b> <b>plate</b> impact test (IDWPIT). In both conventional and instrumented Izod impact testing, PP homopolymer and PP/LDPE blend have similar impact strengths, while PP/HDPE blend exhibits slightly lower impact strength. However, the instrumented Charpy impact test indicates that both PP/LDPE and PP/HDPE have similar impact strengths, and both are slightly lower than PP homopolymer. This suggests that the type of impact test employed is playing {{an important role in the}} impact fracture behaviour of the PP/PE blends. The effect of temperature on the impact fracture behaviour for the PP/PE blends was evaluated by means of the Charpy and drop <b>weight</b> <b>plate</b> impact tests. During the tests, impact strengths reduced with decreasing testing temperature. In the Charpy impact test, the impact strength for PP homopolymer was higher than those of the two PP/PE blends at both 20 and 0 °C. The Etotal measured from the IDWPIT indicated PP/LDPE has the highest impact strength at both 20 and 0 °C. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Weight</b> <b>plates</b> may {{incorporate}} {{holes for}} ease of carrying (called [...] "grip plates") or be solid discs (especially those used for competition). Non-competition plates often have variable diameters and widths, such as on the adjustable dumbbells pictured right, with heavier plates generally being larger in diameter, thickness, or both. <b>Weight</b> <b>plates</b> are typically round, although 12-sided and other polygonal varieties exist. [...] Most plates are coated with enamel paint or hammertone to resist corrosion; more expensive varieties may be coated with chrome, rubber, or plastic.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1940s and early 1950s, Zinkin {{operated}} several gyms in the Los Angeles area. Zinkin {{wanted to make}} strength training safer and more accessible to novices, and thus broaden {{the appeal of the}} sport. To that end, he developed the [...] "weight machine". Instead of lifting a bar with <b>weight</b> <b>plates</b> on it, the user pulls or pushes a handle connected by levers or cables to a stack of <b>weight</b> <b>plates</b> riding on steel guideposts. This allows a user to perform weightlifting exercises with no risk of dropping the weight on himself.|$|R
40|$|A new 5 -MW {{floating}} {{offshore wind}} turbine moored by a spring-tensioned-leg was proposed for installation in about 50 m water depth. Its substructure is a platform of the inverted conical cylinder type with massive ballast <b>weight</b> <b>plate</b> at the bottom. A 1 : 128 scale model was built for the preliminary engineering development. The model tests in waves and wind were carried out to estimate motion characteristics of this platform in the Ocean Engineering Wide Tank of the University of Ulsan. Its motions were measured and the RAOs were compared. The proposed floating {{offshore wind turbine}} showed a good stability and decent responses in waves, wind and operation of the wind turbine...|$|E
40|$|It {{is often}} helpful {{to have a}} {{reliable}} estimate of forage on offer to grazing livestock. Research has shown {{that there is a}} high correlation between forage height and dry matter yield. This correlation is improved when bulk height is determined by depressing the forage with a weighted plate. This <b>weight</b> <b>plate</b> technique referred to as a weighted disk meter, appears to improve the estimate of pasture yield. Different designs of weighted disk meters are called rising plate meters and falling plate meters depending on how measurements are taken. The weighted disk meter described here is a falling plate meter. Weighted disk meters are generally made of sheet metal using an etched metal measuring rod. Researchers have used modifications of this design to establis...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from SAGE Publications via the DOI in this record. The {{purpose of this study}} was to test reports that size and arrangement manipulations of weight plates (i. e., inducing a size-weight illusion [SWI]) would have an effect on athletic weightlifting performance. The participants were 72 experienced, weight-trained collegiate American football players. Across 3 weeks, each athlete performed three different repetitions-to-fatigue bench press tests (NFL- 225, SWI- 225, and SWI- 215). A multiple regression revealed a positive association between participants' strength relative to the test load and repetitions for NFL- 225 and SWI- 215, but no association with SWI- 225. To explore these results, players were ranked into quartiles based on their one-repetition maximum relative to 102. 27 [*]kg (225 [*]lb), and a 3 [*]×[*] 4 repeated measures analysis of variance was conducted. The primary finding was a significant Test Condition[*]×[*]Quartile interaction (p[*]=[*]. 004). Bonferroni-corrected pairwise comparisons revealed that Quartile 4 (those with lowest strength relative to test load) completed more repetitions for SWI- 225 compared with NFL- 225 (p[*]=[*]. 049). These results suggest that alternate <b>weight</b> <b>plate</b> arrangements may be beneficial for those whose bench press load is near the lifter's one-repetition maximum. However, variations of the SWI do not appear to affect the performance of repetitions-to-fatigue bench press tests for the majority of collegiate American football players...|$|E

50|$|BUR-130 - Sometime in the early-1950s, the “BUR-130” {{became the}} only barbell set offered. It set {{consisted}} of a 4-1/2’ knurled pipe bar, dumbbells with fixed collars, and 110 pounds of <b>weight</b> <b>plates.</b>|$|R
50|$|Weightlifting, {{also called}} Olympic-style weightlifting, or Olympic weightlifting, is an {{athletic}} {{discipline in the}} modern Olympic programme in which the athlete attempts a maximum-weight single lift of a barbell loaded with <b>weight</b> <b>plates.</b>|$|R
50|$|Weight {{training}} {{usually requires}} {{different types of}} equipment, most commonly dumbbells, barbells, <b>weight</b> <b>plates,</b> and <b>weight</b> machines. Various combinations of specific exercises, machines, dumbbells, and barbells allow trainees to exercise body parts in numerous ways.|$|R
50|$|This {{exercise}} {{can be done}} using other implements than dumbbells, such as kettlebells or <b>weight</b> <b>plates.</b> There are also machines such as the pec deck which perform a stabilized version of the movement while allowing people to sit upright.|$|R
5000|$|Dumbbells are the {{equivalent}} of one-handed barbells, with a gripping surface approximately 16 cm and a total length that rarely exceeds 50 cm. Adjustable dumbbells are the most prominent use of [...] "standard" [...] <b>weight</b> <b>plates</b> (those having a 1 in center hole).|$|R
50|$|The {{lower level}} {{consists}} of mainly the weightlifting area, racquetball courts, and squash courts. The weight area features {{a wide selection}} of free weight and equipment. There is a total of 24.3 tons of <b>weight</b> <b>plates,</b> 9.5 tons of selectorized weights, and 8.3 tons of dumbbells/barbells.|$|R
50|$|Olympic benches are {{not simple}} benches rather they have several {{additional}} equipment added to them such as squat rack, <b>weight</b> <b>plates,</b> rod, dumbbells and more. It {{is a complete}} workout machine {{that allows you to}} do some advance exercises such as squats, quad exercises, bench press and more.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Weight</b> <b>plates</b> used in Olympic lifting, {{which are}} often termed [...] "bumper" [...] plates, {{need to be able}} to be safely dropped from above head height and as such are coated in solid rubber. General {{strength}} training or powerlifting plates are made from cast iron and are considerably cheaper.|$|R
5000|$|A few {{companies}} sell [...] "fractional" [...] <b>weight</b> <b>plates</b> weighing 1 lb (0.5 kg) or less. These allow [...] "microloading" [...] of bars to achieve very small increments in strength for advanced strength trainees. [...] An alternative for microloading {{is to use}} a set of washers with one- or two-inch center holes.|$|R
5000|$|Duct dead loads: {{are often}} {{simplified}} (in Cement plant usage) by using duct <b>plate</b> <b>weight,</b> multiplied by 1.15 as a stiffener allowance, as duct stiffeners usually weigh less than 15% times the duct <b>plate</b> <b>weight.</b> Duct stiffener allowance for rectangular power plants ductwork may be 50% to 100% of the duct <b>plate</b> <b>weight.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 2012, {{photos of}} Barbosa {{squatting}} were uploaded to social media, {{followed by a}} workout video.

5000|$|<b>Weight</b> <b>plates</b> used {{outside of}} {{competition}} need {{not conform to}} IWF or powerlifting specifications, and can be of any colour, which can be misleading. (For instance, Kraiburg bumper plates are rated in pounds, and one notch lighter than expected, regarding their traditional place in colour code- red plates are 45 lb, blue ones 35 lb, etc.) ...|$|R
50|$|Olympic weightlifting uses a {{steel bar}} (also {{known as a}} barbell) with larger-diameter {{rotating}} sleeves on either end, holding rubber-coated <b>weight</b> <b>plates</b> of different <b>weights.</b> This sleeve rotation {{is important for the}} Olympic lifts, particularly the snatch and clean movements, because it drastically reduces the rotational inertia of the plates. Without sleeve rotation, the Olympic lifter faces more challenging lifts and a greater risk of injury.|$|R
50|$|Another {{key feature}} {{was much easier}} change of weight. With {{barbells}} and dumbbells, lifting at different weights required either a set of bells with different fixed weights, or else adding and removing <b>weight</b> <b>plates</b> at both ends, a process which could take up to a minute. On Zinkin's machines, the weight lifted was selected by inserting a pin into the weight stack; moving the pin took only a few seconds.|$|R
5000|$|BUR Quick Change Set - The “BUR Quick Change” was a barbell with slotted ends. Quick Change weights were U-shaped and slotted - not round - and had hooks {{attached}} to them.

5000|$|The <b>weight</b> <b>plates,</b> {{typically}} {{referred to}} as [...] "bumper plates" [...] because of their rubber coated design, weigh between 0.5 kg and 25 kg. The bumper plates are coated with rubber to allow the weights to be dropped from various heights—either after a successful lift or during an unsuccessful one. Olympic bumper plates conform to international standards for colouring. That is, 10 kg is green, 15 kg is yellow, 20 kg is blue, and 25 kg is red.|$|R
5000|$|Powerlifting is a {{strength}} sport {{that consists of}} three attempts at maximal weight on three lifts: squat, bench press, and deadlift. As in the sport of Olympic weightlifting, it involves the athlete attempting a maximal weight single lift of a barbell loaded with <b>weight</b> <b>plates.</b> Powerlifting evolved from a sport known as [...] "odd lifts", which followed the same three-attempt format but used {{a wider variety of}} events, akin to strongman competition. Eventually odd lifts became standardized to the current three.|$|R
