5|$|Zong had a 17-man crew when it left Africa, which <b>was</b> <b>far</b> <b>too</b> {{small to}} {{maintain}} adequate sanitary {{conditions on the}} ship. Mariners willing to risk disease and slave rebellions on slave ships were difficult to recruit within Britain and were harder to find for a vessel captured from the Dutch {{off the coast of}} Africa. Zong was manned with remnants of the previous Dutch crew, the crew of William, and with unemployed sailors hired from the settlements along the African coast.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 18 he {{was given}} a {{separate}} establishment, and in dramatic contrast with his prosaic, scandal-free father, threw himself with zest into a life of dissipation and wild extravagance involving heavy drinking and numerous mistresses and escapades. He was a witty conversationalist, drunk or sober, and showed good, but grossly expensive, taste in decorating his palace. The Prince of Wales turned 21 in 1783, and obtained a grant of £60,000 (equivalent to £ today) from Parliament and an annual income of £50,000 (equivalent to £ today) from his father. It <b>was</b> <b>far</b> <b>too</b> little for his needs – the stables alone cost £31,000 a year. He then established his residence in Carlton House, where he lived a profligate life. Animosity developed between the prince and his father, who desired more frugal behaviour {{on the part of the}} heir apparent. The King, a political conservative, was also alienated by the prince's adherence to Charles James Fox and other radically inclined politicians.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, the Free Expression Policy Project {{assisted}} 33 academics {{specializing in}} journalism, with filing a friend-of-the-court brief challenging a law which restricted {{the sale of}} violent video games to youths. In 2004 the organization operated at the National Coalition Against Censorship. In 2005 the organization {{was part of the}} Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School. Within the Brennan Center for Justice, the FEPP operated through the Democracy Program at the law school. In 2006 the organization, in collaboration with the Brennan Center for Justice, released a report on the inefficiency of Internet filtering. The 87-page report concluded that academic-based censorship of material on the Internet <b>was</b> <b>far</b> <b>too</b> broad and harmed free expression of ideas. The FEPP became independent from both the National Coalition Against Censorship and the Brennan Center for Justice in 2007.|$|E

5|$|It was {{the opinion}} of Mearns and White who {{investigated}} the wreck that this was unlikely as the damage <b>was</b> <b>far</b> <b>too</b> limited in scale, nor could it account for the outwardly splayed plates also observed in that area. Bill Jurens points {{out that there was}} no magazine of any kind at the location of the break and that the location of the break just forward of the forward transverse armoured bulkhead suggests that the ship's structure failed there as a result of stresses inflicted when the bow was lifted into the vertical position by the sinking stern section. Furthermore, the current position of the plates {{at the edge of the}} break only reflects their last position, not the direction that they first moved.|$|E
5|$|The {{books are}} based on the vampire myth, but Twilight vampires differ in a number of {{particulars}} from the general vampire lore. For instance, Twilight vampires have strong piercing teeth rather than fangs; they glitter in sunlight rather than burn; and they can drink animal as well as human blood. Meyer comments that her vampire mythology differs from that of other authors because she wasn't informed about the canon vampires, saying, It wasn't until I knew that Twilight would be published that I began to think about whether my vampires were too much the same or too much different from the others. Of course, I <b>was</b> <b>far</b> <b>too</b> invested in my characters at that point to be making changes... so I didn't cut out fangs and coffins and so forth as a way to distinguish my vampires; that's just how they came to me.|$|E
5|$|Most historians sharply criticize Davis for his flawed {{military}} strategy, {{his selection}} of friends for military commands, and his neglect of homefront crises. Until {{late in the}} war, he resisted efforts to appoint a general-in-chief, essentially handling those duties himself. On January 31, 1865, Lee assumed this role, but it <b>was</b> <b>far</b> <b>too</b> late. Davis insisted on a strategy of trying to defend all Southern territory with ostensibly equal effort. This diluted the limited resources of the South and made it vulnerable to coordinated strategic thrusts by the Union into the vital Western Theater (e.g., the capture of New Orleans in early 1862). He made other controversial strategic choices, such as allowing Lee to invade the North in 1862 and 1863 while the Western armies were under very heavy pressure. When Lee lost at Gettysburg, Vicksburg simultaneously fell, and the Union {{took control of the}} Mississippi River, splitting the Confederacy. At Vicksburg, the failure to coordinate multiple forces {{on both sides of the}} Mississippi River rested primarily on Davis's inability to create a harmonious departmental arrangement or to force such generals as Edmund Kirby Smith, Earl Van Dorn, and Theophilus H. Holmes to work together.|$|E

5|$|Rowley {{first learned}} of the {{operations}} off Grand Port on 22 August, when Windham arrived off Saint Paul. Eager to support Pym's attack, Rowley immediately set sail in his frigate HMS Boadicea, with the transport Bombay following with two companies of the 86th Regiment of Foot to provide a garrison on any territory seized in the operation. The headwinds were strong {{and it was not}} until 29 August that Rowley arrived off Grand Port, having been notified of the situation there by Magiciennes launch the previous day. Sighting a cluster of frigates around Île de la Passe, Rowley closed with the island before turning sharply when Vénus and Manche raised their colours and gave chase. Rowley repeatedly feinted towards the French ships and then pulled away, hoping to draw them away from Grand Port in the hope that Bombay might board the now unprotected Iphigenia and capture her. Bombay was thwarted by the reappearance of Astrée and Entreprenant and Rowley was chased by Vénus and Manche back to Saint Denis, anchoring there on 30 August. Rowley attempted a second time to rescue Iphigenia from Grand Port the following week, {{but by the time he}} returned Bellone and Minerve had been refloated and the French force <b>was</b> <b>far</b> <b>too</b> strong for Rowley's flagship to attack alone.|$|E
5|$|The Das Reich {{division}} attacked on {{the same}} day, along {{the west side of}} Kharkov. After penetrating into the city's Zalyutino district, the advance was stopped by a deep anti-tank ditch, lined with Soviet defenders, including anti-tank guns. A Soviet counterattack was repulsed after a bloody firefight. A detachment of the division fought its way to the southern approaches of the city, cutting off the road to Merefa. At around 15:00, Hoth ordered Hausser to immediately disengage with the Das Reich, and instead redeploy to cut off escaping Soviet troops. Instead, Hausser sent a detachment from the Totenkopf division for this task and informed Hoth that the risk of disengaging with the Das Reich <b>was</b> <b>far</b> <b>too</b> great. On the night of 11–12 March, a breakthrough element crossed the anti-tank ditch, taking the Soviet defenders by surprise, and opening a path for tanks to cross. This allowed the Das Reich to advance to the city's main railway station, which would be the farthest this division would advance into the city. Hoth repeated his order at 00:15, on 12 March, and Hausser replied as he had replied on 11 March. However, a third attempt by Hoth was obeyed, and Das Reich disengaged, using a corridor opened by LSSAH to cross northern Kharkov and redeploy east of the city.|$|E

25|$|In October 1641, a major {{rebellion}} {{broke out}} in Ireland. Charles soon needed to raise more money to suppress this Irish Rebellion.

25|$|In the Austrian view it {{was this}} {{inflation}} of the money supply that led to an unsustainable boom in both asset prices (stocks and bonds) and capital goods.

25|$|The {{principal}} {{source of}} contention between the Prince and Venizelos concerned their {{vision for the}} island's government.
