25|$|Modern liberal {{democracy}} is a compromise between the twin ideals of freedom and democracy. Mosterín emphasizes their differences: freedom comes down to doing what I want to do; democracy, to doing what (the majority of) the others <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Rejecting as muddled the metaphysical notion of free will, he focuses on political freedom, the absence of coercion or interference by others in my personal decisions. Because of the tendencies to violence and aggression that lurk in human nature, some constraint on freedom is necessary for peaceful and fruitful social life, but the more freedom we enjoy, the better. Especially, there is no rational ground for curtailing the cultural freedoms (of language, religion and customs) {{in the name of}} the nation, the church or the party. From this point of view, Internet provides a much more attractive model than the obsolete nation-state or the nationalistic movements. Mosterín thinks that the nation-state is incompatible with the full development of freedom, whose blossoming requires the reorganization of the world political system along cosmopolitan lines. He proposes a world without nation-states, territorially organized in small autonomous but not-sovereign cantonal polities, complemented by strong world organizations.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} a {{critical}} success, though some critics wondered about the social impact of a character that they saw as sympathetic. Cagney was still struggling against his gangster typecasting. He said to a journalist, [...] "It's what the people <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Some day, though, I'd like to make another movie that kids could go and see." [...] However, Warner Bros., perhaps searching for another Yankee Doodle Dandy, assigned Cagney a musical for his next picture, 1950's The West Point Story with Doris Day, an actress he admired.|$|E
500|$|In Shiloh, Naylor {{does not}} impart an {{explicit}} meaning of [...] "honesty" [...] to her juvenile readers, journalist Nancy Gilson observed. Instead, she conveys how [...] "confusing and unanswerable" [...] morality is using main character Marty's ethical predicaments and plot twists. To harbor Shiloh from the antagonist Judd and his principled parents, Marty must steal food and tell falsehoods. His dishonest actions {{serve as a}} contrast to his conscientious persona and his benevolent rescuing of the dog. Every night, Marty prays, [...] "Jesus ... which do you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> Be one hundred percent honest and carry that dog back to Judd so {{that one of your}} creatures can be kicked and starved all over again, or keep him here and fatten him up to glorify your creation?" ...|$|E

500|$|Veteran {{video game}} cover {{illustrator}} Marc Ericksen painted the North American box art, which included Mega Man firing a pistol {{instead of his}} trademark Mega Buster. Ericksen explained, [...] "I didn't know anything about Mega Man, and [...] I said to the art director, 'What is he shooting with?' ... He said, 'Well, he must have a pistol, because I don't see a rifle.' ... I said, 'So, a pistol? Do you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a pistol?' And he said, 'Yeah, let's put a pistol in there.' So I did what I was told and I put the pistol in there. Add {{to the fact that}} they only had, like, a day and a half for me to do the painting and what you wound up with was not the greatest result. But certainly a result that was not my fault. I mean, they told me to put the pistol in his hand!" ...|$|E
500|$|During her {{audition}} for the show, Thorne read the {{lines from the}} Pembleton character in a previous episode. She said of her audition, [...] "I said, 'So what do you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> Do {{you want me to}} be a female Pembleton?' And they were like, 'Well we don't want to say that but that's sort of the idea." [...] Thorne said the producers were looking for [...] "a certain type in terms of a strong woman who could keep up with all the men" [...] and that they incorporated elements of Thorne's own personality into the character, such as the strong amount of trust she has in her instincts. Thorne also said she was treated well by the cast, but upon starting, [...] "I was very aware of the fact that it's predominantly men, and I have no problem saying that as a small, dark woman I was terrified. I thought I was going to be put through the ringer." [...] Gerety, when asked about his experience joining the show, said only, [...] "It's interesting. It's really interesting." ...|$|E
500|$|Smith, aged 13 at the time, {{signed a}} record-breaking multi-album deal with Universal Classics and Jazz in December 2008, {{six months after}} {{finishing}} outside the top three in the Britain's Got Talent series two final. Her debut album, Faryl, was released in March 2009. Smith later described the album as [...] "an introduction to me and an introduction for me to recording", {{and said that she}} [...] "wanted to follow up [...] as quickly as possible with another record, something richer and varied". In July, it was announced that work had begun on her second album, with hopes to release it later in the year. Smith {{said in an interview that}} [...] "We're starting to look at what songs will be on the second album ... I'm not really choosing the songs myself, I'm leaving that up to the people at the record label. I'm really happy that they <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> another album so soon – I didn't think I would be working on one so quickly after the first one was released ... I'm just excited to get under way with it." ...|$|E

500|$|As an {{openly gay}} man {{throughout}} his career, Sylvester {{came to be}} seen as a spokesman for the gay community. He informed a journalist that [...] "I realize that gay people have put me on a pedestal and I love it. After all, of all the oppressed minorities, they just have to be the most oppressed. They have all the hassles of finding something or someone to identify with [...] and they chose me. I like being around gay people and they've proven to be some of my closest friends and most loyal audiences." [...] Elsewhere, he nevertheless remarked that he felt his career had [...] "transcended the gay movement. I mean, my sexuality has nothing to do with my music. When I'm fucking I'm not thinking about singing and vice versa." [...] He was openly critical of what he perceived as divisive tendencies within the gay community itself, noting that [...] "I get this conformist shit from queens all the time. They always want to read me. They always <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it their way. I am not going to conform to the gay lifestyle as they see it and that's for sure". He was particularly critical of [...] "clones" [...] gay men who dressed alike with boots, boot-cut jeans, checked shirts and handlebar mustaches [...] stating that all too often they judged those gay people who were flamboyant or extravagant.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} {{to a total}} of 944 theatres, with an extra 66 being added later. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $2.5million ($ in [...] dollars), becoming the tenth highest-grossing film of that week. The next week it had a 60% decline in sales. The film grossed a total of $7.3million ($ in [...] dollars) worldwide, and was a box office bomb. It was placed at 97 on the top 100 movies of 1987 list. Morton noted that although [...] "Madonna's comic talent was acknowledged, cinemagoers in the United States stayed away in droves." [...] The film was better accepted in the foreign released territories, prompting Madonna to defend herself, rather weakly, that her ideas were better accepted in Europe and Japan, rather than her home country. She added, [...] "I think the movie did badly in America because I upstaged it with my tour. People were confused about the connection between the record, the tour and the movie because they all had the same title. I also think there are people who don't <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> well in both fields. I had to really fight to get any respect from the music business and now I guess {{there are some people who}} feel that I ought to be grateful for that respect and stick to music." [...] Nevertheless, Warner Bros. decided to release the film in home media in VHS on November 11, 1987, a decision not approved by Madonna.|$|E
2500|$|On 11 May, it was {{announced}} that Farage would continue to serve as the party’s leader, with the BBC reporting: [...] "Party chairman Steve Crowther said the national executive committee believed the election campaign had been a ‘great success’ and members had ‘unanimously’ rejected Mr Farage's letter of resignation". Interviewed about his continued leadership by the BBC the following day, Farage said: [...] "I resigned. I said I'd resign. I turned up to the NEC meeting with letter in hand fully intending to carry that through. They unanimously said they didn't <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that, they presented me with petitions, signatures, statements from candidates saying it would be a bad thing for UKIP. So I left the meeting, went and sat in darkened room to think about what to do, and decided for the interest of the party I would accept their kind offer for me to stay and tear up the letter." [...] He added that he would consider standing for parliament again should a by-election be called in a Labour-held seat.|$|E

2500|$|Transferred to Supreme Army Command as Chief of Staff to the Quartermaster General {{at the end}} of April 1918, Thaer {{reported}} to Hindenburg and Ludendorff on 1 May 1918. [...] He had already resolved that he would report openly on the frontline situation to the two men running the war. [...] By that criterion he failed. [...] The field-marshall hero of Tannenberg was sympathetic: [...] "My dear Mr von Thaer, your nerves have certainly been affected by the last few terrible weeks through which you have come. [...] I think that the good spirits at Supreme Army Command will soon set you right". [...] Thaer encountered a similar, if less avuncular, reaction a little later when he {{reported to}} First Quartermaster General Erich von Ludendorff: [...] "What's your game? [...] What do you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> [...] Should I now make peace at any price?" [...] Thaer replied: [...] "Excellence, I said nothing about that. [...] Ot is my duty - and it is a very painful duty - {{to point out that the}} condition of our troops is not going to improve, but will continue slowly to deteriorate". [...] Ludendorff persisted: [...] "If the condition of our troops is getting worse, if discipline is deteriorating, then that is your fault and the fault of all those field commanders who do not get it. [...] How else can it be that entire divisions can found too drunk to fight, unable to implement the necessary advances. [...] That is the explanation for the great March offensive, and now [...] Operation Georgette, not progressing further.|$|E
2500|$|The {{design of}} the {{building}} fell into the time period of the Edwardian Baroque, a time at which {{emphasis was placed on}} the use of heavy classical motifs in order to emphasise power and imperial authority. The design process of the mansion was long, complicated and politically charged. Lutyens' early designs were all starkly classical and entirely European in style. His disrespect for the local building tradition he dismissed as primitive, is evident in his numerous sketches with appended scrawls such as 'Moghul tosh' and his short remark that 'they <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> Hindu – Hindon't I say!' In the post-Mutiny era, however, it was decided that sensitivity must be shown to the local surroundings in order to better integrate the building within its political context, and after much political debate Lutyens conceded to incorporating local indo-Saracenic motifs, albeit in a rather superficial decorational form on the skin of the building. Various Indian designs were added to the building. These included several circular stone basins on top of the building, as water features {{are an important part of}} Indian architecture. There was also a traditional Indian chujja or chhajja, which occupied the place of a frieze in classical architecture; it was a sharp, thin, protruding element which extended [...] from the building, and created deep shadows. It blocks harsh sunlight from the windows and also shields the windows from heavy rain during the monsoon season. On the roofline were several chuttris, which helped to break up the flatness of the roofline not covered by the dome. Lutyens appropriated some Indian designs, but used them sparingly and effectively throughout the building. There were also statues of elephants and fountain sculptures of cobras in the gar of the retaining walls, as well as the bas-reliefs around the base of the Jaipur Column, made by British sculptor, Charles Sargeant Jagger. The column has a [...] "distinctly peculiar crown on top, a glass star springing out of bronze lotus blossom".|$|E
