Mansour remained director of DSS until 1987. Under her leadership, the department's error rate dropped to its lowest levels in awarding food stamps, Medicaid funds, and Aid to Families <b>with</b> <b>Dependent</b> Children (AFDC). She increased the investigation and conviction of fraud cases, and she achieved the highest national record of locating deadbeat parents for collecting child support. She streamlined office procedures, and she initiated programs to curtail teenage pregnancy and to assist teenage mothers. She broadened the state program benefiting victims of domestic abuse.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, after {{constructing}} two {{welfare reform}} bills that Clinton vetoed, Gingrich {{and his supporters}} pushed for passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, which was intended to reconstruct the welfare system. The act gave state governments more autonomy over welfare delivery, while also reducing the federal government's responsibilities. It instituted the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which placed time limits on welfare assistance and replaced the longstanding Aid to Families <b>with</b> <b>Dependent</b> Children program. Other changes to the welfare system included stricter conditions for food stamp eligibility, reductions in immigrant welfare assistance, and work requirements for recipients. The bill {{was signed into law}} by President Clinton on August 22, 1996.|$|E

Hearings on national health insurance were held in 1971, but no bill {{had the support of}} House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committee chairmen Representative Wilbur Mills and Senator Russell Long.
