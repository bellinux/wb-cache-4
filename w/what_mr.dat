500|$|Bottomley's last public venture was an {{engagement}} at the Windmill Theatre in September 1932, where he performed a monologue of reminiscences that, according to Symons, puzzled rather than amused his audience. Following a health breakdown, {{he lived with}} Primrose in quiet poverty until his final illness. He died in the Middlesex Hospital on 26 May 1933, and was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium a few days later. A large crowd heard the Revd Basil Bourchier express the hope that [...] "no one here today will forget <b>what</b> <b>Mr</b> Bottomley did to revive the spirits of our men at the Front". Four years later, in accordance with Bottomley's wishes, Primrose scattered the ashes on the Sussex Downs.|$|E
500|$|The {{first edition}} {{sold out in}} six weeks. It was only some months {{afterward}} that the voice of Francis Jeffrey, the highly respected editor of The Edinburgh Review, was heard. Jeffrey began by expressing reservations: {{this is not a}} book of great learning and less a book of criticism than of appreciation. And yet, Jeffrey concedes, the [...] "appreciation" [...] is of the highest kind, and he is [...] "not [...] much inclined to disagree with" [...] Hazlitt [...] "after reading his eloquent exposition" [...] of the points he makes about Shakespeare. [...] "The book [...] is written less to tell the reader <b>what</b> <b>Mr.</b> H. knows about Shakespeare or his writings, than to explain to them what he feels about them—and why he feels so—and thinks that all who profess to love poetry should feel so likewise." [...] While Characters does not [...] "show extraordinary knowledge of [...] production" [...] it nevertheless shows [...] "very considerable originality and genius." ...|$|E
500|$|Most critics' praise went to Robin Williams' {{performance}} as Genie, with Janet Maslin of The New York Times declaring that children [...] "needn't know precisely <b>what</b> <b>Mr.</b> Williams is evoking {{to understand how}} funny he is." [...] Warner Bros. Cartoons director Chuck Jones even called the film [...] "the funniest feature ever made." [...] Furthermore, English-Irish comedian Spike Milligan considered {{it to be the}} greatest film of all time. James Berardinelli gave it 3.5 out of 4 stars, praising the [...] "crisp visuals and wonderful song-and-dance numbers." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said the comedy made the film accessible to both children and adults, a vision shared with Desson Howe of The Washington Post, who also said [...] "kids are still going to be entranced by the magic and adventure." [...] Brian Lowry of Variety praised the cast of characters, describing the expressive magic carpet as [...] "its most remarkable accomplishment" [...] and considered that [...] "Aladdin overcomes most story flaws thanks to sheer technical virtuosity." ...|$|E

500|$|When Mr. Dooley {{could be}} found behind his bar, his sayings {{remained}} at a high standard. Roosevelt remained a target, friend, and White House host, one who took seriously <b>what</b> <b>Mr.</b> Dooley said and corresponded with Dunne about it. In 1906, {{after the publication of}} Upton Sinclair's muckraking The Jungle, about the unsanitary horrors of the meatpacking trade, Dooley summed up the objections of the packers, [...] "if they had a blind man in the Health Department, a few competent friends on the Federal Bench, and [...] Farmer Bill Lorimer to protect the cattle interests of the Great West, they cared not who made the novels of our country." [...] In June 1907, Dooley and Hennessy speculated as to what Roosevelt would do when his term expired in 1909. Dooley stated that were he an ex-president, the publican would try to do something really hard and likely to take up the remainder of his days, [...] "I'd thry to be President again".|$|E
500|$|... "W.L.S.", {{reviewing}} Cott in The Geographical Journal in 1940, {{begins with}} [...] "In this large and well-illustrated volume the author discusses at length reason or {{reasons for the}} various colour patterns found in the animal kingdom." [...] The reviewer goes on [...] "He has presented us with {{a vast number of}} facts and observations which are somewhat difficult to analyse." [...] However [...] "W.L.S." [...] admits that disruptive coloration [...] "is discussed at considerable length by Mr. Cott and many remarkable instances of it are considered in detail". The review ends by mentioning that while biologists (of the 1930s) usually [...] "reject the influence of Natural Selection in evolution, the facts of adaptive coloration as given in Mr. Cott's work are a strong argument in its favour, and must be given due weight. This is <b>what</b> <b>Mr.</b> Cott claims to have accomplished in a volume which will certainly take its place as a most valuable contribution to zoological literature." ...|$|E
500|$|As Minister of Internal Affairs, Harper {{oversaw the}} indaba (conference) of chiefs and headmen at Domboshawa in October 1964, {{at the end}} of which the tribal leaders {{unanimously}} announced their support for the government's line on independence. He continued to be linked with the premiership. During Smith's negotiations with the British government, each breakdown or setback was accompanied by speculation in Rhodesia ("Southern" [...] was dropped in late 1964) that Harper might step up to take his place. As the dispute with Britain intensified and white Rhodesians clamoured for independence, Harry Franklin reported in The Spectator in August 1965 that if Smith proved unwilling to go through with UDI, [...] "it is widely believed that... Harper will emerge from the wings, no longer an understudy, to dare <b>what</b> <b>Mr</b> Smith dare not." [...] Harper was one of four ministers chosen by Smith to accompany him to London for talks in October 1965, the others being John Wrathall (Finance), Desmond Lardner-Burke (Justice) and the Deputy Minister of Information PK van der Byl. Agreement was not reached and a month later, on 11 November 1965, Smith and his Cabinet declared Rhodesia independent.|$|E

500|$|Mr. Burns wants Marge {{to paint}} his {{portrait}} for the Burns Wing of the Springfield Art Museum. She reluctantly agrees, {{as long as}} Mr. Burns insists that the painting portray him as a beautiful man. While Mr. Burns heckles Marge as she does the painting, Homer finds out that he has lost 21 pounds from his exercise regimen and now weighs 239. After Mr. Burns insults Homer's weight, Lisa and Maggie, Marge throws him out and is ready to quit until Homer encourages her to finish the painting: She also gets a reply from Starr, who is decades behind on answering his fanmail, praising her artwork. After working {{until well into the}} night, she finishes the painting and then it is unveiled {{at the opening of the}} Burns Wing. The painting depicts a naked, frail, and weak Mr. Burns. The people are shocked, until Marge explains that it depicts <b>what</b> <b>Mr.</b> Burns actually is: a vulnerable human being who will, one day, be no more. Mr. Burns is outraged at first, but then, like everyone else, accepts his new glory, praises Marge's painting and thanks Marge [...] "for not making fun of [...] genitalia", to which Marge replies, [...] "I thought I did." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{review by}} John Ferriar in the October 1805 Monthly Review argued, [...] "It {{has fallen to}} the lot of this writer to puzzle our {{critical}} discernment more than once [...] He has no contrived to manufacture a large quarto, which he has styled a poem, but of what description it is no easy matter to decide [...] The poem of Madoc is not didactic, nor elegiac, nor classical, in any respect [...] Respecting the manners, Mr. Southey {{appears to have been}} more successful than in his choice of the story. He has adhered to history where he could discover any facts adapted to his purpose; and when history failed him, he has had resource to probability." [...] Ferriar continued with an attack on the Welsh names that appear within the poem: [...] "we own that the nomenclature of his heroes has shocked <b>what</b> <b>Mr.</b> S. would call our prejudices. Georvyl and Rird and Rodri and Llaian may have charms for Cambrian ears, but who can feel an interest in Tezozomoc, Tlalala, or Ocelopan [...] how could we swallow Yuhidthiton, Coanocotzin, and, above all, the yawnings jaw-dislocating Ayayaca?—These torturing words, particularly the latter, remind us so strongly of the odious cacophony of the Nurse and Child, that they really are not to be tolerated." ...|$|E
500|$|The McMahons, {{along with}} The Spirit Squad, {{continued}} their feud with Shawn Michaels. In {{the weeks that}} followed, Michaels would get revenge on both the McMahons and the Spirit Squad. On the May 22 episode of Raw, however, Michaels was in a 5-on-1 handicap match, and the Spirit Squad members, in storyline, injured Michaels' left knee. Triple H, who was included during the rivalry, was ordered by Vince McMahon to [...] "break Michaels' skull", with his signature sledgehammer. Triple H failed to do <b>what</b> <b>Mr.</b> McMahon ordered, turned into a crowd favorite and attacked the Spirit Squad. Weeks followed in which Triple H was supposed {{to become a member}} of Mr. McMahon's [...] "Kiss My Ass Club". Triple H, however, backfired when trying to become a member, when he gave a Pedigree to McMahon and laid him and Shane out in the ring. On the June 12 episode of Raw, McMahon booked Triple H in a Handicap Gauntlet match against the Spirit Squad. The match saw Michaels return from his storyline injury, which led to Triple H and Michaels reforming their previous wrestling stable D-Generation X. At Vengeance, DX met the Spirit Squad in a 5-on-2 handicap match, which DX won.|$|E

500|$|In 1886, Roe {{was only}} {{available}} {{for two of}} Somerset's matches, but the following year, {{he was one of}} the team's leading batsmen. He scored three fifties, and accumulated 272 runs in all for the county, second only to the club captain, Ted Sainsbury. He was less effective in 1888, averaging just 13 runs with a top-score of 27. Despite this, he was elected captain at the club's annual general meeting. Sainsbury, though a good cricketer, was unpopular with the club's committee as he did not live near to Taunton. Herbie Hewett was first proposed, but he declined to take the position. Roe was then elected unanimously to the position, with Hewett as his vice-captain. The club chairman noting that [...] "considering <b>what</b> <b>Mr</b> Roe had done for the club his appointment would be a well-deserved compliment." [...] Despite this, the 1889 season summaries refer to Hewett as being the captain, [...] and at the annual meeting that year, it was noted that Hewett was re-elected as captain. Whether he was captain or not, Roe had a poor season. He played four of Somerset's eight matches, averaging 6.1 runs. Indeed, half his 43 runs that season came in one innings, when he scored 27. After the close of Somerset's formal county fixtures, Roe found some form, hitting 83 runs against the Gentlemen of Wiltshire, and 104 against the Gentlemen of Devon.|$|E
500|$|Following the sentence, the Chicago Tribune {{editorial}} board praised [...] "the bravery {{of the victims}} and their families who confronted the man who was once second in line to be president" [...] and wrote of the sentence: [...] "The enduring impact is that the truth has been revealed. And {{for as long as the}} name Dennis Hastert is recalled, the man once respected as a leader will be known as a criminal, a scoundrel, a child molester." [...] The Washington Post {{editorial board}} hailed the sentence, writing that Hastert's victims [...] "should not have had to struggle with <b>what</b> <b>Mr.</b> Hastert did to them all the while they watched him rise in stature and power." [...] The Post called for extending statutes of limitations in sex-abuse cases to give victims more time to come forward and prosecutors more time to pursue perpetrators. New York Times columnist Frank Bruni wrote that Hastert's case underscored the danger that comes with the [...] "quickness and frequency with which so many of us equate displays of religious devotion with actual rectitude," [...] noting that Hastert's public displays of Christian faith during his time in office were [...] "a factor in his colleagues' assessments of him as safe, uncontroversial." [...] Bruni also critiqued the testimonials that prominent Republicans submitted on Hastert's behalf before sentencing, saying that these [...] "affirm the degree to which pacts rather than principle govern partisan politics today." ...|$|E
2500|$|Senator Chuck Schumer confronted Gonzales {{over this}} statement: [...] "That is not <b>what</b> <b>Mr.</b> Comey says; {{that is not}} what the people in the room say."

2500|$|In January 2006, Hagel {{took issue}} with Karl Rove's {{statement}} that the Republican and Democratic worldviews were [...] "post-9/11" [...] and [...] "pre-9/11", respectively. Hagel stated, [...] "I didn't like <b>what</b> <b>Mr.</b> Rove said, because it frames terrorism {{and the issue of}} terrorism and everything that goes with it, whether it's the renewal of the Patriot Act or the NSA wiretapping, in a political context." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jay Carney, the White House Press Secretary at the time, {{spoke for}} President Obama {{on the matter}} by saying the {{president}} does not support, but actually opposes, some of the kind of words and lyrics that have been written by Common and others. Even though {{the president does not}} support the lyrics in question, he believed that some reports were distorting <b>what</b> <b>Mr.</b> Lynn stands for more broadly.

2500|$|In 2017, Russia {{nominated}} Schröder to {{also serve}} as an independent director {{of the board of}} its biggest oil producer Rosneft. At the time, Rosneft was under Western sanctions over Russia’s role in the Ukraine crisis. Schröder told Blick that he would be paid about $350,000 annually for the part-time post. His decision caused an outcry in Germany and abroad, especially in a climate of fear about any potential Russian interference in the 2017 German elections.

2500|$|Rather {{has been}} {{referenced}} {{in the television}} shows Saturday Night Live and Family Guy and many films. An animated caricature of him made a cameo appearance in the JibJab political cartoon, Good to Be in D.C. He made a cameo in a 1971 episode of All in the Family entitled [...] "The Man in the Street", in which Archie wants to see himself interviewed for the evening news, but it is preempted by a speech given by Richard Nixon.

2500|$|In {{his review}} in The New York Times, A.O.

Rather than trying to update, transform or otherwise interpret Nickleby, he has decided to share his enthusiasm for it [...] [...] [...] [...] has adapted [...] with a scholar's ear and a showman's flair [...] [...] [...] [...] produced a colorful, affecting collage of Dickensian moods and motifs, a movie that elicits an overwhelming desire to plunge into 900 pages of 19th-century prose." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{terms of}} our modern {{understanding}} of the Greeks, {{and in particular the}} early use of their nascent Greek alphabet, the finds of Naucratis {{have turned out to be}} foundational.

[...] Of particular interest are the several examples of an evolutionary variation from the original Phoenician alphabetic script.
