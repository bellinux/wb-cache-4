25|$|Europeans brought many {{diseases}} <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>because</b> {{they had}} many more domesticated animals than the Native Americans.

25|$|The {{spread of}} Arts and Crafts ideas {{during the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries {{resulted}} {{in the establishment of}} many associations and craft communities, although Morris had little to do <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>because</b> of his preoccupation with socialism at the time. A hundred and thirty Arts and Crafts organisations were formed in Britain, most between 1895 and 1905.|$|E

50|$|Specific {{types of}} victimization have been {{strongly}} linked to particular symptoms or outcomes.

25|$|Gregg and Gibbs {{held the}} line on Adams Road just south of Brooks Road for almost two hours before Gibbs's brigade retreated. Gregg's {{position}} could not be held without Gibbs's support and his men fell back. When Gregg and Gibbs fell back past Ford's Station Road, they took Smith's brigade from Fitzgerald's Ford <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>because</b> Smith's force would have been cut off by Pickett's advance where they were positioned. When forced to withdraw, Smith had held off Fitzhugh Lee's attack at the ford until nearly 5:30p.m. Smith reformed on the left of Capehart's brigade of Custer's division on Adams Road.|$|E

Here {{he joined a}} large horse troop bound west, but the party soon had to send the horses back to Jasper's House and continue on snowshoes, taking only the essentials <b>with</b> <b>them,</b> <b>because</b> Athabasca Pass was already too deeply snowed in that late in the year. They crossed the pass on November 12 and three days later joined a canoe brigade that had been waiting to take them down the Columbia River.|$|E
25|$|Pintarić {{was born}} in 1941 in Zrinski Topolovac near Bjelovar. During World War II, his father Ilija joined the Partisan resistance, but {{near the end of}} the war he was taken away by the Ustaše and spent several months <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> <b>Because</b> of this, in June 1945 Ilija was beaten by Department of National Security (OZNA) agents in the {{presence}} of his family, including Pintarić and his elder brother Josip, and then taken away. Pintarić's mother urged Ilija's Partisan comrades to intervene on his behalf, but they refused. Ilija never returned; according to rumors, he was shot the day after his arrest.|$|E

25|$|According to the Life of St. Macarius, when he {{was still}} a baby, he would start crying every time he heard the ringing of the bells of the nearby church. There was no way to console the child. The parents would not want to bring the baby boy to the church, afraid that he would disturb the service with his crying; but {{eventually}} they decided to try. And, to their surprise, as soon as they brought the child to the church, he became quiet, smiling joyfully. From this time on, the parents had to attend every service at the parish church, and to take the child <b>with</b> <b>them,</b> <b>because</b> if they stayed at home during the service, the baby would again start crying.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Ridgway is {{believed}} to have murdered at least 71 women (according to Ridgway, in an interview with Sheriff Dave Reichert in 2001) near Seattle and Tacoma, Washington. His court statements later reported that he had killed so many, he lost count. A majority of the murders occurred between 1982 and 1984. The victims were believed to be either sex workers or runaways picked up along Pacific Highway South (International Blvd. 99), whom he strangled. Most of their bodies were dumped in wooded areas around the Green River, except for two confirmed and another two suspected victims found in the Portland, Oregon area. The bodies were often left in clusters, sometimes posed, usually nude. He would sometimes return to the victims' bodies and have sexual intercourse <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> <b>Because</b> most of the bodies were not discovered until only the skeletons remained, three victims are still unidentified. Ridgway occasionally contaminated the dump sites with gum, cigarettes, and written materials belonging to others, and he even transported a few victims' remains across state lines into Oregon to confuse the police.|$|E
25|$|Jeff Tweedy {{was invited}} to play at Chicago's Noise Pop festival, {{and was told that}} he could {{collaborate}} with a musician of his choosing. Tweedy chose Jim O'Rourke based on his fascination with O'Rourke's Bad Timing album. O'Rourke offered to bring drummer Glenn Kotche to the festival, and the trio formed a side project named Loose Fur. The other band members of Wilco had written a number of songs for Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, but Tweedy was unsatisfied <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>because</b> he believed that the songs did not sound like the ones he played with Loose Fur. Tweedy became such a fan of Kotche's playing style that he decided to dismiss Ken Coomer from the band in favor of Kotche. Tweedy had strong feelings about how songs should be sequenced, which clashed with Jay Bennett's focus on the songs themselves. Because Bennett was mixing the album, this led to a series of arguments about how the album should sound between songs. Tweedy asked O'Rourke to remix several songs on the album that had been mixed by Bennett, which caused tensions within the band to escalate. The album was completed in June 2001, and Tweedy was insistent that it was in its final form. Tweedy also fired Jay Bennett around this time, believing (according to Jay Bennett) that Wilco should only have one core member. The band maintains that the firing of Jay Bennett was a collective decision.|$|E

60|$|Her {{mother looked}} after {{her with the}} edge of her fan over her mouth till she {{disappeared}} {{in the depths of the}} hotel corridor; then she sat down near the steps, and chatted with some half-grown boys lounging on the balustrade, and waited for Munt to come up over the brink of the precipice. Dan Mavering came with him, running forward with a polite eagerness at sight of Mrs. Pasmer. She distributed a skillful astonishment equally between the two men she had equally expected to see, and was extremely cordial <b>with</b> <b>them,</b> not only <b>because</b> she was pleased <b>with</b> <b>them,</b> but <b>because</b> she was still more pleased with her daughter's being, after all, like other girls, when it came to essentials.|$|R
25|$|To gain back {{ground in}} Greece, Germany reluctantly began a Balkans Campaign {{alongside}} Italy which resulted {{also in the}} destruction of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1941 and the ceding of Dalmazia to Italy. Mussolini and Hitler compensated Croatian nationalists by endorsing the creation of the Independent State of Croatia under the extreme nationalist Ustaše. In order to receive the support of Italy, the Ustaše agreed to concede the main central portion of Dalmazia as well as various Adriatic Sea islands to Italy, as Dalmazia held a significant number of Italians. The ceding of the Adriatic Sea islands was considered by the Independent State of Croatia to be a minimal loss, as in exchange for those cessions they were allowed to annex all of modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina, which led to the persecution of the Serb population there. Officially, the Independent State of Croatia was a kingdom and an Italian protectorate, ruled by Italian House of Savoy member Tomislav II of Croatia, but he never personally set foot on Croatian soil and the government was run by Ante Pavelić, the leader of the Ustaše. However, Italy did hold military control across all of Croatia's coast, which combined with Italian control of Albania and Montenegro gave Italy complete control of the Adriatic Sea, thus completing {{a key part of the}} Mare Nostrum policy of the Fascists. The Ustaše movement proved valuable to Italy and Germany as a means to counter Royalist Chetnik guerrillas (although they did work <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>because</b> they did not really like the Ustaše movement whom they left up to the Germans) and the communist Yugoslav Partisans under Josip Broz Tito who opposed the occupation of Yugoslavia.|$|E

[...] The Grand Prix also marked the first win by Toro Rosso, the first non-Ferrari Italian-based team to win since 1957.

500|$|Edmondson {{wanted to}} Americanise the game, as the {{original}} had a British banger racing feel. Therefore, the cars were designed to resemble the stock cars used in NASCAR racing, while all the tracks were situated in the United States. [...] Edmondson also wanted appropriate music for American stock car races, so he attended races across the United States, where he noticed that metal music featured prominently. Thrash metal bands Jug and Tuscan were therefore chosen to compose the soundtrack, as {{some members of the}} team were involved <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> <b>Because</b> soft-spoken commentary would not fit with the soundtrack, commentator Paul Page was asked to serve as the game's announcer due to his [...] "animated and excitable" [...] style.

500|$|The group {{returned}} from the Continent, with a pregnant Clairmont, and settled in Bath (to protect her reputation, they attempted to hide the pregnancy). Imlay saw Shelley twice in September 1816; according to Todd's interpretation of Fanny's letters, Fanny had earlier tried to solicit an invitation to join the group in Europe and she repeated these appeals when she saw Shelley in London. Todd believes that Imlay begged {{to be allowed to}} stay <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>because</b> life in Godwin's house was unbearable, with the constant financial worries and Mrs Godwin's insistent haranguing, and that Shelley refused, concerned with anyone learning about Clairmont's condition, most of all someone he believed might inform Godwin (Shelley was being sued by his wife and was worried about his own reputation). After Shelley left, Todd explains that Imlay wrote to Mary [...] "to make clear again her longing to be rescued".|$|E
500|$|On why {{he chose}} to return to television, Scorsese said [...] "What's {{happening}} the past 9 to 10 years, particularly at HBO, is what we had hoped for in the mid-Sixties with films being made for television at first. We'd hoped there would be this kind of freedom and also {{the ability to create}} another world and create longform characters and story. That didn't happen in the 1970s, 1980s and in the 1990s I think. And of course ...HBO is a trailblazer in this. I've been tempted over the years to be involved <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>because</b> of the nature of long-form and their development of character and plot." [...] He went on to praise network HBO by saying, [...] "A number of the episodes, in so many of their series, they're thoughtful, intelligent [...] brilliantly put together... It's a new opportunity for storytelling. It's very different from television of the past." ...|$|E
