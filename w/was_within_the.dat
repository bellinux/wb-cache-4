5|$|Although Operation Backstop <b>was</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> UNPROFOR mandate (since the peacekeepers were {{authorised}} to {{use force}} to prevent armed incursions into the UNPAs), Croatian authorities resented the operation. Croatia considered the UNPROFOR overzealous in defending the UNPAs and protecting the Serbs while failing to ensure the fulfilment of other aspects of the Vance plan, such as the return of refugees to their homes.|$|E
5|$|Conflict {{among the}} Christian {{population}} of Neapolis emerged in 451. By this time, Neapolis <b>was</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> Palaestina Prima province {{under the rule}} of the Byzantine Empire. The tension was a result of Monophysite Christian attempts to prevent the return of the Patriarch of Jerusalem, Juvenal, to his episcopal see. However, the conflict did not grow into civil strife.|$|E

5|$|As the {{intelligence}} {{available to them}} was not conclusive, the Allies believed that Tirpitz still posed a potential threat. Accordingly, Nos. 9 and 617 Squadrons made two further attacks on the battleship after she moved to Tromsø on 15 October; these operations were more straightforward to conduct than Operation Paravane as the port <b>was</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> range of Lancasters flying from airfields in northern Scotland. The first raid, Operation Obviate, took place on 29 October but caused only minor damage to the battleship. During the subsequent attack conducted on 12 November, Operation Catechism, Tirpitz was struck by several Tallboy bombs and capsized with heavy loss of life among her crew.|$|E

5|$|His {{fleet of}} 13 ships sailed {{far into the}} western Atlantic Ocean, perhaps intentionally, where he made {{landfall}} on what he initially {{assumed to be a}} large island. As the new land <b>was</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> Portuguese sphere according to the Treaty of Tordesillas, Cabral claimed it for the Portuguese Crown. He explored the coast, realizing that the large land mass was probably a continent, and dispatched a ship to notify King Manuel I of the new territory. The continent was South America, and the land he had claimed for Portugal later {{came to be known as}} Brazil. The fleet reprovisioned and then turned eastward to resume the journey to India.|$|E
5|$|Historically, Aldermaston was a hundred, {{though for}} a period it <b>was</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> Theale hundred.

It was at all times an ecclesiastical parish and acquired civil parish status in the 1890s.|$|E

Operations were moved to a new larger site, still located in Cranleigh, in February 2001. The company believed this would reduce operating costs and allow for future expansion.|$|E

5|$|In the 2013 Indian Premier League, Karthik {{had some}} good starts for the Mumbai Indians, in the early matches: in particular, when he scored a quick 86 against the Delhi Daredevils in their home match at the Wankhede Stadium.

5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 19th century the {{population}} and physical extent of London grew greatly. The increasing resident population and the development of a commuting population arriving by train each day led to a high level of traffic congestion with huge numbers of carts, cabs, and omnibuses filling the roads and up to 200,000 people entering the City of London, the commercial heart, each day on foot. By 1850 there were seven railway termini around the urban centre of London: London Bridge and Waterloo to the south, Shoreditch and Fenchurch Street to the east, Euston and King's Cross to the north, and Paddington to the west. Only Fenchurch Street station <b>was</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> City.|$|E
5|$|Isaac Newton had {{considered}} the {{effect in the}} Principia, but pessimistically thought that any real mountain would produce too small a deflection to measure. Gravitational effects, he wrote, were only discernible on the planetary scale. Newton's pessimism was unfounded: although his calculations had suggested a deviation of less than 2minutes of arc (for an idealised three-mile high mountain), this angle, though very slight, <b>was</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> theoretical capability of instruments of his day.|$|E

5|$|Kentucky's {{citizens}} were split regarding the issues {{central to the}} Civil War. The state had strong economic ties with Ohio River cities such as Pittsburgh and Cincinnati {{while at the same}} time sharing many cultural, social, and economic links with the South. Unionist traditions were strong throughout the Commonwealth's history, especially in the east. With economic ties to both the North and the South, Kentucky had little to gain and much to lose from a war between the states. Additionally, many slaveholders felt that the best protection for slavery <b>was</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> Union.|$|E
5|$|Measures, {{which were}} {{the means by which}} the National Assembly for Wales passed {{legislation}} between 2006 and 2011, were assented to by the Queen by means of an Order in Council.

5|$|On 1 May, {{the first}} mission was {{conducted}} by a single Vulcan (XM607) that flew over Port Stanley and dropped its bombs on the airfield concentrating on the single runway, with one direct hit, making it unsuitable for fighter aircraft. The Vulcan's mission was quickly followed up by strikes against anti-air installations, flown by British Aerospace Sea Harriers from nearby Royal Navy carriers. Three Vulcan missions were flown against the airfield, a further two missions in which missiles were launched against radar installations; an additional two missions were cancelled. At the time, these missions held {{the record for the}} world's longest-distance raids. The ECM systems on board the Vulcans proved to be effective at jamming Argentine radars; while a Vulcan <b>was</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> theatre, other British aircraft in the vicinity had a greatly reduced chance of coming under effective fire.|$|E
