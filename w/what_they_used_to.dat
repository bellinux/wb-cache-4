2500|$|In 616, {{with the}} empire even more engulfed in rebellions, Emperor Yang was asking his {{officials}} how the rebellions were being suppressed. [...] Yuwen falsely {{stated that the}} rebels {{had been reduced to}} less than 10% of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> be. [...] Su initially declined to answer the question, but after Emperor Yang insisted on hearing his answer, he responded that while he did not know the numbers, the rebels were getting closer to Luoyang—and that, further, the taxes and labor levies were severely decreased due to rebel activities. [...] He further pointed out that Emperor Yang was reneging on his promise to stop considering campaigns against Goguryeo. [...] Emperor Yang was displeased. [...] Further, at Duanwu Festival, while the other officials submitted treasures as gifts to the emperor, Su submitted a copy of the Classic of History. [...] Emperor Yang was displeased when someone pointed out that the Classic of History contained a chapter entitled the Song of the Five Sons -- a lament by the five brothers of King Taikang of Xia Dynasty that he lost his kingdom due to his excessive cruelty and hunting—and believed that Su was criticizing him. [...] He was further incensed when Su, while discussing the issue of another campaign against Goguryeo, sarcastically suggested that if Emperor Yang pardoned all of the agrarian rebels, there would be hundreds of thousands of soldiers available to attack Goguryeo. [...] Emperor Yang thereafter complained about Su to Pei Yun, and Pei Yun then had a man named Zhang Xingben (張行本) accuse Su of inappropriate promotions and fear of Tujue. [...] Emperor Yang removed Su from his posts, and then further accusations that Su was conspiring with Tujue were made. [...] Emperor Yang had Pei Yun investigate it, and Pei proposed that Su be executed. [...] Su, unable to prove his innocence, begged for forgiveness. [...] Emperor Yang took pity and released him, but stripped him of citizenship rights, along with his descendants for three generations. [...] Soon, however, it appeared that Su was restored to some extent, as he accompanied Emperor Yang to Jiangdu (江都, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) in 617, although he was not restored to his posts, as Pei Yun and Yu suggested to Emperor Yang that Su was too old to be effective.|$|E
