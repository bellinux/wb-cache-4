500|$|By October, the Foundation's {{financial}} affairs {{had reached}} a crisis point. According to his public relations assistant, Barbara Klowden, Hubbard became increasingly paranoid and authoritarian due to [...] "political and organizational problems with people grabbing for power." [...] He began an affair with the twenty-year-old Klowden, much to the annoyance of Northrup, who was clearly aware of the liaison. Klowden recalled that Northrup [...] "was very hostile to me. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> guns and {{she said to me}} that I was the type to use a Saturday night special" [...] (a very cheap [...] "junk gun"). One evening he arranged a double-date with his wife and Klowden, who was accompanied by Hollister, an instructor in the Los Angeles Dianetic Foundation. The dinner party backfired drastically; Northrup began an affair with Hollister, a handsome 22-year-old who was college-educated and a noted sportsman.|$|E
500|$|Asked in February 2017 {{if there}} would be more Audioslave reunion shows in the future, Cornell replied, [...] "It's always a possibility. I mean, we've been talking about it for at least three or four years now. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> {{actually}} picking dates, and it just ended up not working out because everybody's so busy. They have another band again, they all have separate bands that they do themselves, I have Soundgarden and a solo career that's taking up a lot of time, and I just did Temple of the Dog. So, it's really honestly as simple as we end up having a window of time where it's comfortable for everybody and we want to do it, because I definitely feel like everybody's up for it." [...] On May 18, 2017, Cornell was found dead in his hotel room in Detroit after performing at a show with Soundgarden, ending the possibility of a reunion.|$|E
500|$|In April 2014, Cameron {{expected}} {{to finish the}} three scripts within six weeks, stating that all three sequels would be in production simultaneously and were still slated for December 2016 to 2018 releases. He stated that although Friedman, Jaffa and Silver, and Salerno are each co-writing one sequel with him, they at first all worked together on all three scripts: [...] "I didn't assign each writer which film {{they were going to}} work on until the last day. I knew if I assigned them their scripts ahead of time, they'd tune out every time <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the other movie." [...] "We... worked out every beat of the story across all three films so it all connects as one, sort of, three-film saga." [...] Cameron also stated that Weaver would be featured in all three sequels and that her character Grace Augustine would be alive. In March 2015, however, Weaver said that she will play a new character in the next film.|$|E

500|$|Joel Brind, {{a faculty}} member at Baruch College in the Department of Natural Sciences, is the primary {{advocate}} of an abortionbreast cancer ("ABC") link. Brind is strongly anti-abortion and began lobbying politicians with the claim that abortion caused breast cancer in the early 1990s. Brind found that his lobbying efforts were not taken seriously because he had not published his findings in the peer-reviewed medical literature. He therefore collaborated with two anti-abortion physicians and a statistician to publish a 1996 article in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, arguing that induced abortion was a risk factor for breast cancer. The statistician who collaborated with Brind later stated of their findings: [...] "I have some doubts. I don't think the issue has been resolved. When <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the conclusions, he [...] wanted to make the strongest statements. I tried to temper them a little bit, but Dr. Brind is very adamant about his opinion." ...|$|E
500|$|Selman {{wanted to}} include {{things in the}} episode that [...] "only really hard-core foodies would {{have any idea what}} <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> This was like a love letter to foodie culture." [...] Food {{references}} featured in the episode include jokes about sriracha sauce and sous-vide cooking, referrals to chefs Wylie Dufresne, Frank Bruni, and Ruth Reichl, a mention of the soup phở from Vietnam and how to pronounce it correctly, and the inclusion of the El Chemistri owner who is based on the Spanish chef José Andrés (known for using molecular gastronomy). Selman has commented that food produced with the help of molecular gastronomy [...] "lends itself to comedy quite nicely. There’s a dish , for instance, called Regret. The waiter cries into your soup when he serves it. The human tear is the final ingredient." [...] The fictional character Swedish Chef is also seen in the episode, and the scene where the meth dealer is reminded of his childhood after eating the apple pie is a reference to the Pixar film Ratatouille, which was written and directed by former Simpsons consultant Brad Bird.|$|E
500|$|In April 2013, J. August Richards, one of {{the stars}} of the earlier Joss Whedon series Angel, was cast in the pilot in an {{unspecified}} role, later revealed to be Mike Peterson, the first live-action portrayal of Deathlok and a recurring character throughout the season. Nicholas Brendon, another Whedon collaborator, was also reportedly considered for Richards' role. In December, two recurring characters were set to be added to the series with the episode [...] "T.A.H.I.T.I." [...] They were described as [...] "an African-American agent who specializes in combat/weapons, and a high-level S.H.I.E.L.D. agent/munitions expert who has past ties to both Coulson and Ward." [...] In January 2014, Bill Paxton was cast as Agent John Garrett, [...] "a rough-and-tumble former cohort of Agent Coulson with a little bit of attitude and cigar-smoking swagger", for at least four episodes of the season. Jed Whedon said that [...] "We actually discussed Bill Paxton in the room, when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the character ... Then when he came up as an actual possibility, we couldn't believe it." [...] The next month, B.J. Britt was cast as Agent Triplett, an associate of Garrett. Other recurring guests in the season include Saffron Burrows as Victoria Hand, David Conrad as Ian Quinn, and Ruth Negga as Raina.|$|E

500|$|At two secret {{meetings}} on 16 and 18 November 1959, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force General Twining, recommended the Air Force's {{plan for the}} B-70 to reconnoiter and strike rail-mobile Soviet ICBMs, but the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, General White, admitted the Soviets would [...] "be able to hit the B-70 with rockets" [...] and requested the B-70 be downgraded to [...] "a bare minimum research and development program" [...] at $200 million for fiscal year 1960. President Eisenhower responded that the reconnaissance and strike mission was [...] "crazy" [...] since the nuclear mission was to attack known production and military complexes, and emphasized that he saw {{no need for the}} B-70 since the ICBM is [...] "a cheaper, more effective way of doing the same thing". Eisenhower also identified that the B-70 would not be in manufacturing until [...] "eight to ten years from now" [...] and [...] "said he thought <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> bows and arrows at a time of gunpowder when we spoke of bombers in the missile age".Note: 18 November meeting quotations in this article are Goodpaster's paraphrasing of White & Eisenhower (e.g., [...] "said he [...] thought we [...] ") – possibly from an audio recording if one was made at Augusta. In December 1959 the Air Force announced the B-70 project would be cut to a single prototype, and most of the planned B-70 subsystems would no longer be developed.|$|E

We signed an oil deal at the same time. The commerce and politics and deals were all with the PTA. This was one animal {{and the other was}} the compassionate release.
