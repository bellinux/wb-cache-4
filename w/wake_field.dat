50|$|Electron wake is the {{disturbance}} left after a high-energy charged particle passesthrough condensed matter or plasma. Ions passing through can introduce periodic oscillations in the crystal lattice or plasma wave with the characteristic {{frequency of the}} crystal or plasma frequency. Interactions of the field created by these oscillations with the charged particle field alternate from constructive interference to destructive interference, producing alternating waves of electric field and displacement. The frequency of the <b>wake</b> <b>field</b> {{is determined by the}} nature of the penetrated matter, and the period of the <b>wake</b> <b>field</b> is directly proportional to the speed of the incoming charged particle. The amplitude of the first wake wave is the most important, as it produces a braking force on the charged particle, eventually slowing it down. Wake fields also can capture and guide lightweight ions or positrons in the direction perpendicular to the wake. The larger the speed of the original charged particle, the larger the angle between the initial particle's velocity and the captured ion's velocity.|$|E
50|$|Conservation {{of linear}} {{momentum}} relates the induced velocity downstream {{in the far}} <b>wake</b> <b>field</b> to the rotor thrust per unit of mass flow. Conservation of energy considers these parameters {{as well as the}} induced velocity at the rotor disk. Conservation of mass relates the mass flow to the induced velocity. The momentum theory applied to a helicopter gives the relationship between induced power loss and rotor thrust, which can be used to analyze the performance of the aircraft. Viscosity and compressibility of the air, frictional losses, and rotation of the slipstream in the wake are not considered.|$|E

40|$|<b>Wake</b> <b>fields</b> in the CLIC Beam Delivery System (BDS) {{can cause}} severe single or multi-bunch effects leading to {{luminosity}} loss. The main contributors in the BDS are geometric and resistive wall <b>wake</b> <b>fields</b> of the collimators and resistive wall wakes {{of the beam}} pipe. The present master thesis focuses only on the multi-bunch effects from resistive wall. Using particle tracking with <b>wake</b> <b>fields</b> through the BDS, we have established the aperture radius, above which {{the effect of the}} <b>wake</b> <b>fields</b> becomes negligible.

50|$|Isser's {{research}} {{focused on}} modeling the non-linear airflow dynamics around rotor blades of helicopters in slow axial flight or during hovering. Isser added additional accuracy to well established models of unsteady rotor aerodynamics {{that had previously}} been developed by scientists at the Technion and at other research institutions. These basic models assumed linear distribution of air circulation along the blades and a linear wake geometry. In reality, however, small airflow velocity perturbations are caused by small vertical motions of the blades, resulting in variations in the induced <b>wake</b> <b>field</b> and airflow velocities. These airflow perturbations were not included in previous unsteady airflow models. In contrast, Isser's model added harmonic factors into the airflow model, taking into account the small periodic vertical motions of the blades during hovering or slow axial flight and treating the airflow differently in the near and far fields of the wake. To reduce the complexity of the model, Isser assumed mathematical simplifications. Then he conducted simulations of simple <b>wake</b> <b>field</b> profiles in order to test the accuracy of the model. Not only was the model validated {{with a high degree of}} accuracy for the case of constant circulation along the blades and radial trailing edges, but, thanks to Isser's updates, the model's accuracy and ability to predict rotor behavior during pitch and roll maneuvers was also significantly improved. The enhanced model predicted correctly the helicopter off‚Äêaxis response, a phenomenon that was beyond the capability of previous models. The improved model could also predict more accurate designs of rotor blade profiles to better match the wake-field non-linear geometry around rotary wing platforms, improving both the flight dynamics and hovering efficiency of rotary wing platforms.|$|E

40|$|For TESLA-FEL {{operation}} {{the electron}} beam is {{extracted from the}} regular accelerating structure at the desired en-ergy level and then transferred by a long transfer line to the experimental hall [1]. It is required that longitudinal and transverse emittance be kept small. <b>Wake</b> <b>fields,</b> excited from various devices e. g. pumping holes, quadrupole ta-pers, beam position monitors, can cause emittance growth.

30|$|On {{both sides}} of the plasma void in the nightside, there exist {{electric}} fields called ‚Äúwake‚Äù fields. In regions very close to the body, a strong <b>wake</b> <b>field</b> is excited in the direction toward the body (Kimura and Nakagawa, 2008; Umeda et al., 2011). As the distance from the body becomes great, the structure of the upper (+y) side of the <b>wake</b> <b>field</b> becomes bipolar while the intensity of the <b>wake</b> <b>field</b> becomes smaller on the lower (‚àíy) side. This asymmetric feature is different from the structure of the <b>wake</b> <b>field</b> seen in the previous Vlasov simulation (Umeda et al., 2011) where the IMF is taken in the in-plane directions (x‚Äìy plane). It is noted that there appear spatial oscillations on the noon-side of the object because of a numerical effect {{due to a lack of}} spatial resolution for a Debye sheath (Umeda et al., 2011).|$|E
40|$|The scale {{effects of}} an aft hull <b>wake</b> <b>field</b> pose a great {{challenge}} to propeller design and its performance prediction.

For this research, using a KCS ship as the research target, the aft shape of an original ship model has been modified based on the smart dummy model (SDM) to change its nominal <b>wake</b> <b>field.</b> The present study explores the aft hull deformation of a KCS ship through a series of numerical calculations and validates the results using a similar ship model. In addition, <b>wake</b> <b>field</b> PIV-measurements are performed using particle image velocimetry to verify the corrected effects of the SDM.

40|$|Microwave {{instability}} {{is still}} an open subject not totally understood. The common theory regards the phenomenon as a coupling of coherent modes of oscillation that generates instability. The <b>wake</b> <b>fields</b> are responsible of this coupling and cause, as a consequence, an increase of energy spread. According to the theory, there is a threshold below which the <b>wake</b> <b>fields</b> do not change the energy spread but only the bunch length. In this paper we assume that <b>wake</b> <b>fields</b> can produce a heating of the bunch, thus increasing the energy spread even below threshold.
