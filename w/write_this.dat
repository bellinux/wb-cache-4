5|$|Written by Christopher Priest, the {{opportunity}} to <b>write</b> <b>this</b> four-part story was offered to Priest after his previous script, Sealed Orders, had been cancelled. The scene breakdown was commissioned on 5 December 1980 and the scripts on 6 February 1981. Priest's story idea dealt with the 'secret' of what actually powered the TARDIS, in this case fear. Somewhere hidden inside the TARDIS was the one being the Doctor feared above all others, and the psychic {{tension between the two}} of them produced the energy to move through space and time. The story involved the Doctor having to confront and ultimately defeat this fear, and was designed to write out the character of Adric. After hearing nothing from the production office with regard to his completed scripts or his payment for them, Priest made contact with John Nathan-Turner. He was told that the scripts were unusable and that he would not be paid. After a bitter dispute Priest was paid and both Nathan-Turner and Eric Saward forced to pen a letter of apology over their treatment of the writer. The script was replaced by Saward's script Earthshock.|$|E

25|$|RAID-Z is a data/parity {{distribution}} scheme like RAID-5, but uses dynamic stripe width: every {{block is}} its own RAID stripe, regardless of blocksize, resulting in every RAID-Z write being a full-stripe <b>write.</b> <b>This,</b> when combined with the copy-on-write transactional semantics of ZFS, eliminates the write hole error. RAID-Z is also faster than traditional RAID5 {{because it does not}} need to perform the usual read-modify-write sequence.|$|E

25|$|The {{main issue}} of gender {{equality}} in Ivory Coast is the education. According to CIA World Factbook, the literacy rate in Ivory Coast in total is 43.1%. 53.1% of males can {{read and write}} and only 32.5% of females can read and <b>write.</b> <b>This</b> shows {{that more than half}} of men can read, and less than half of women can read. It also states that the school life expectancy for males is ten years, whereas for girls it’s eight years. So far, no specific organizations have helped women education in Ivory Coast. However, many organizations have helped education for women in Africa as a whole, such as Africa Education Trust and Aid for Africa.|$|E
25|$|The {{nature of}} {{enslavement}} in Cherokee {{society in the}} antebellum years was often {{similar to that in}} European-American slave society, with little difference between the two. The Cherokee instituted their own slave code and laws that discriminated against slaves and free blacks. Cherokee law barred intermarriage of Cherokee and blacks, whether the latter were enslaved or free. African Americans who aided slaves were to be punished with 100 lashes on the back. Cherokee society barred those of African descent from holding public office, bearing arms, voting, and owning property. It was illegal for anyone within the limits of the Cherokee Nation to teach blacks to read or <b>write.</b> <b>This</b> law was amended so that the punishment for non-Cherokee citizens teaching blacks was a request for removal from the Cherokee Nation by authorities.|$|E

25|$|The Gullah {{have also}} {{struggled}} {{to preserve their}} traditional culture {{in the face of}} much more contact with modern culture and media. In 1979, a translation of the New Testament into the Gullah language was begun. The American Bible Society published De Nyew Testament in 2005. In November 2011, Healin fa de Soul, a five-CD collection of readings from the Gullah Bible, was released. This collection includes Scipcha Wa De Bring Healing ("Scripture That Heals") and the Gospel of John (De Good Nyews Bout Jedus Christ Wa John <b>Write).</b> <b>This</b> was also the most extensive collection of Gullah recordings, surpassing those of Lorenzo Dow Turner. The recordings have helped people develop an interest in the culture, because they get to hear the language and learn how to pronounce some words.|$|E
25|$|That Heidegger did not <b>write</b> <b>this</b> {{second part}} of Being and Time, and that the existential {{analytic}} was {{left behind in the}} course of Heidegger's subsequent writings on the history of being, might be interpreted as a failure to conjugate his account of individual experience with his account of the vicissitudes of the collective human adventure that he understands the Western philosophical tradition to be. And this would in turn raise the question of whether this failure is due to a flaw in Heidegger's account of temporality, that is, of whether Heidegger was correct to oppose vulgar and authentic time. There are also recent critiques in this regard that were directed at Heidegger's focus on time instead of primarily thinking about being in relation to place and space, and to the notion of dwelling, with connections too to architectural theory as impacted by phenomenology.|$|E
25|$|In 1932, Fitzgerald's wife Zelda Sayre Fitzgerald {{was hospitalized}} for {{schizophrenia}} in Baltimore, Maryland. The author rented the La Paix {{estate in the}} suburb of Towson to <b>write</b> <b>this</b> story of {{the rise and fall}} of Dick Diver, a promising young psychiatrist, and his wife, Nicole, who is also one of his patients. It was Fitzgerald's first novel in nine years and the last that he would complete. The early 1930s, when Fitzgerald conceived the book, were the darkest years of his life, and the novel's bleakness reflects his own experiences. The novel almost mirrors the events of Fitzgerald and Zelda's lives, as characters are pulled and put back into mental care, and the male figure, Dick Diver, starts his descent into alcoholism. While working on the book, Fitzgerald was beset with financial difficulties. He borrowed money from both his editor and his agent and wrote short stories for commercial magazines.|$|E
