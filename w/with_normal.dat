The quantities measured with NMR are time-averaged chemical shifts, as proton exchange is fast on the NMR time-scale. Other chemical shifts, such as those of 31P can be measured.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of {{molecular}} alterations are under study for their prognostic impact in AML. However, only FLT3-ITD, NPM1, CEBPA and c-KIT are currently included in validated international risk stratification schema. These are expected to increase rapidly in the near future. FLT3 internal tandem duplications (ITDs) {{have been shown to}} confer a poorer prognosis in AML <b>with</b> <b>normal</b> cytogenetics. Several FLT3 inhibitors have undergone clinical trials, with mixed results. Two other mutations - NPM1 and biallelic CEBPA are associated with improved outcomes, especially in people <b>with</b> <b>normal</b> cytogenetics and are used in current risk stratification algorithms.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We exhibit several {{transformations of}} {{surfaces}} in R 4. First, one {{that takes a}} flat surface and gets a surface <b>with</b> flat <b>normal</b> bundle; then, one that takes a surface <b>with</b> flat <b>normal</b> bundle and gets a flat surface; finally, a one-parameter family of transformations {{on a flat surface}} <b>with</b> flat <b>normal</b> bundle and gives a flat surface <b>with</b> flat <b>normal</b> bundle. This family satisfies a permutability property. 1. ...|$|R

5|$|After mating, sheep have a {{gestation}} period of around five months. Within {{a few days}} of the impending birth, ewes begin to behave differently. They may lie down and stand erratically, paw the ground, or otherwise act out of sync <b>with</b> <b>normal</b> flock patterns. A ewe's udder will quickly fill out, and her vulva will swell. Vaginal, uterine or anal prolapse may also occur, in which case either stitching or a physical retainer can be used to hold the orifice in if the problem persists.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} the fourth fundamental forms for hypersurfaces in Hn+ 1 and space-like hypersurfaces in S 1 n+ 1, {{and discuss the}} conformality of the normal Gauss map of the hypersurfaces in Hn+ 1 and S 1 n+ 1. Particularly, we discuss the surfaces <b>with</b> conformal <b>normal</b> Gauss map in H³ and S³ 1, and prove a duality property. We give a Weierstrass representation formula for space-like surfaces in S³ 1 <b>with</b> conformal <b>normal</b> Gauss map. We also state the similar results for time-like surfaces in S³ 1. Some examples of surfaces in S³ 1 <b>with</b> conformal <b>normal</b> Gauss map are given and a fully nonlinear equation of Monge-Ampère type for the graphs in S³ 1 <b>with</b> conformal <b>normal</b> Gauss map is derived...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. The aim of {{the study}} is to compare the {{clinical}} effectiveness of the probiotics—Saccharomyces boulardii and Bifidobacterium lactis—in children who had been diagnosed with rotavirus gastroenteritis. Materials and methods. Seventy five patients aged between 5 months– 5 years diagnosed as rotavirus gastroenteritis were included in the study. The patients diagnosed as rotavirus gastroenteritis by latex agglutination test in stool were divided into 3 groups of twenty-five patients each: First group was given oral rehydration therapy and rapid refeeding <b>with</b> a <b>normal</b> diet <b>with</b> Saccharomyces boulardii (spp. I- 745), second group was given oral rehydration therapy and rapid refeeding <b>with</b> a <b>normal</b> diet <b>with</b> Bifidobacterium lactis (spp. B 94, culture number:∘ 118529) and third group received only oral rehydration therapy and rapid refeeding <b>with</b> a <b>normal</b> diet. Results. The duration of diarrhea was shorter in the group given oral rehydration therapy and rapid refeeding <b>with</b> a <b>normal</b> diet <b>with</b> Bifidobacterium lactis and Saccharomyces boulardii than the group given only oral rehydration therapy and rapid refeeding <b>with</b> a <b>normal</b> diet. Conclusion. Bifidobacterium lactis has a complemental role in the treatment of rotavirus gatroenteritis and other probiotics may also have a beneficial effect in rotavirus gastroenteritis compared with the therapy included only oral rehydration therapy and rapid refeeding <b>with</b> a <b>normal</b> diet...|$|R

Platforming elements include jumping across chasms, climbing ladders, and swinging on ropes. Some puzzles require Kratos to move a box {{on top of a}} switch (thus activating it), or moving a box {{to use it as a}} jumping-off point to reach a pathway unreachable <b>with</b> <b>normal</b> jumping. Game length is approximately two to four hours, and it consists of ten levels.|$|E
5|$|Another {{method that}} has been used to {{establish}} the date of eruption is tree-ring dating. Tree-ring data has shown that a large event interfering <b>with</b> <b>normal</b> tree growth in North America occurred during 1629–1628 (±65 years)BCE. Evidence of a climatic event around 1628BCE has been found in studies of growth depression of European oaks in Ireland and of Scotch pines in Sweden. Bristlecone pine frost rings also indicate a date of 1627BCE, supporting the late 1600sBCE dating. Procedural changes in how ice cores are interpreted would bring that data more in line with the dendrochronological numbers.|$|E

5|$|In {{another of}} her studies, Morgan worked with a fox breeder to {{study the effects of}} diets that {{contained}} low and normal amounts of B vitamins. The experimental group (the vitamin-restricted foxes) developed a fine, sparse gray coat that resembled the fashionable fur of the silver fox. Morgan found that the foxes <b>with</b> <b>normal</b> intake of B vitamins had shiny black fur. After the experiments, a fur stole was made out of fur from both the experimental and control groups. Morgan wore the stole on at least two important occasions – her presentation of the study data in 1939 and her Garvan Medal award ceremony ten years later.|$|E

Since the 1970s, there has been a considerable effort to develop similar vaccination strategies for humans. The first vaccine, called RTS,S, was approved by European regulators in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, an individual's tissues are {{resistant}} {{to the effects of}} parathyroid hormone. This is known as pseudohypoparathyroidism. In this case the parathyroid glands are fully functional, and the hormone itself is not able to function, resulting in a decrease in blood calcium levels. Pseudohypoparathyroidism is often associated with the genetic condition Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy. Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism, one of the longest words in the English language, is used to describe an individual with Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy; <b>with</b> <b>normal</b> parathyroid hormone and serum calcium levels.|$|E
5|$|Some {{evidence}} supports {{the use of}} intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Immune suppression tends to be less effective than in other autoimmune diseases. Prednisolone (a glucocorticoid or steroid) suppresses the immune response, and the steroid-sparing agent azathioprine may replace it once therapeutic effect has been achieved. IVIG may be used {{with a degree of}} effectiveness. Plasma exchange (or plasmapheresis), the removal of plasma proteins such as antibodies and replacement <b>with</b> <b>normal</b> plasma, may provide improvement in acute severe weakness. Again, plasma exchange is less effective than in other related conditions such as myasthenia gravis, and additional immunosuppressive medication is often needed.|$|E

40|$|Subjects <b>with</b> high <b>normal</b> blood {{pressure}} {{are at high}} risk of developing hypertension. Thus, the criteria of the Canadian Hypertension Education Program for diagnosis of hypertension and recommendations for follow-up now recommend that patients <b>with</b> high <b>normal</b> {{blood pressure}} (130 mmHg to 139 mmHg systolic and/or 85 mmHg to 89 mmHg diastolic) be followed up annually for the development of hypertension. Clinical trial data from subjects <b>with</b> high <b>normal</b> blood pressure show that 40 % over two years and 63 % over four years developed hypertension (140 / 90 mmHg or higher). These data are consistent with observational data from the Framingham Heart Study, which found a similar risk. Besides annual follow-up, the Canadian Hypertension Education Program recommends lifestyle therapy for individuals <b>with</b> high <b>normal</b> blood pressure.

5|$|The {{menstrual cycle}} is the regular natural change {{that occurs in}} the female {{reproductive}} system (specifically the uterus and ovaries) that makes pregnancy possible. The cycle {{is required for the}} production of ovocytes, and for the preparation of the uterus for pregnancy. Up to 80% of women report having some symptoms during the one to two weeks prior to menstruation. Common symptoms include acne, tender breasts, bloating, feeling tired, irritability and mood changes. These symptoms interfere <b>with</b> <b>normal</b> life and therefore qualify as premenstrual syndrome in 20 to 30% of women. In 3 to 8%, they are severe.|$|E

5|$|It {{is widely}} {{suspected}} that the anaerobic bacterial species Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) contributes {{to the development of}} acne, but its exact role is not well understood.

It is unclear whether these undesirable strains evolve on-site or are acquired, or possibly both depending on the person. These strains have the capability of changing, perpetuating, or adapting to the abnormal cycle of inflammation, oil production, and inadequate sloughing of dead skin cells from acne pores. Infection with the parasitic mite Demodex is associated with the development of acne. It is unclear whether eradication of the mite improves acne.|$|E
