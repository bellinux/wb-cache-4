It’s my personal faith, religious faith, that I don’t believe that the people <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> should be raising our children. It’s not a natural thing. You need a mother and a father. You need a man and a woman. That’s what God intended.|$|E
25|$|A young Faroese {{person is}} {{normally}} handed down {{a set of}} children's Faroese clothes that have passed from generation to generation. Children are confirmed at age 14, and normally start to collect the pieces to make an adult outfit, which is considered as a rite of passage. Traditionally the aim {{would have been to}} complete the outfit by the time a young person was ready to marry and wear the clothes at the ceremony—though it is mainly only men <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> now.|$|E
25|$|This {{style of}} goaltending is {{a blend of}} {{stand-up}} and butterfly style, where the goaltender primarily relies on reaction, save selection, and positioning to make saves. Hybrid goaltenders will usually control rebounds well, deflect low shots with their sticks, will utilize the butterfly, and are generally not as predictable as goaltenders who rely heavily on the butterfly as a save selection. Most players are not pure stand-up or butterfly, but simply tend to prefer stand-up or butterfly over the other. If a player does not have any preferences, he is considered a hybrid goalie. All modern NHL goaltenders generally use some form of this style. Some goalies <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> effectively are Henrik Lundqvist, Ryan Miller, Jaroslav Halák, Jimmy Howard, and Tuukka Rask.|$|E

500|$|Feldman has {{admitted}} in several interviews {{that he has}} been the victim of people who email him to explain psychiatric symptoms, only to divulge eventually that they created it all to fool a doctor. For prolonged cases, he states the impetus for such behavior is the [...] "longing for nurturing, sympathy, care and concern that they feel unable to get in appropriate ways," [...] and that the admiration of forum members is a strong motivator to continue. As manipulation is integral to most cases, the need to control others to feel as if the perpetrator is in control {{of his or her own}} life is apparent, as is the pre-existence of underlying personality disorders. Many people who present factitious disorders crave sympathy and support because it was notably absent in childhood. In a story published in The Village Voice in 2001, a woman recovering from factitious disorder remembered her drive to create conditions that did not exist: [...] "When I'd do something to attract the paramedics and police, I got an adrenaline rush. I believe I got addicted to it. At the time, it didn't occur to me I was hurting anyone but myself." [...] A psychologist who was a member of the support group for premature infants stated in The New York Times article, [...] "People <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> need something. I wonder if it's a metaphor for some other loss she experienced and is playing over and over again in different shapes." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{dangerous}} situations that leads to bear attacks is when a bear perceives a threat to her offspring. Female bears are very defensive of their young, devoting, on their own without any participation of the male bear, many years of their lives just to raise their cubs and teach them to hunt, hence the term [...] "mama bear" [...] to refer to extremely reactive and protective mothers of humans, particularly those <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> without paternal care. While solo bears will usually retreat, a mother bear protecting her cubs is mostly likely to attack any sudden threat. Black bears present something of an exception to this, however, as mother black bears sometimes urge their cubs to climb trees for safety instead of remaining on the ground to protect their young.|$|E
2500|$|Rashi exerted {{a decisive}} {{influence}} on establishing the correct {{text of the}} Talmud. Up to and including his age, texts of each Talmudic tractate were copied by hand and circulated in yeshivas. Errors often crept in: sometimes a copyist would switch words around, and other times incorporate a student's marginal notes into the main text. Because of {{the large number of}} merchant-scholars who came from throughout the Jewish world to attend the great fairs in Troyes, Rashi was able to compare different manuscripts and readings in Tosefta, Jerusalem Talmud, Midrash, Targum, and the writings of the Geonim, and determine which readings should be preferred. However, in his humility, he deferred to scholars who disagreed with him. For example, in Chulin 4a, he comments about a phrase, [...] "We do not read this. But as for those <b>who</b> <b>do,</b> <b>this</b> is the explanation..." ...|$|E

2500|$|Coercive {{behaviour}} of men {{towards the}} opposite sex can be argued to {{be a result of}} male sexual entitlement. Gender stereotypes view men and boys as being the more typically aggressive sex. Subsequently, they may act aggressively towards women and girls in order to increase their chances of submission from them. This is known as male sexual entitlement – the belief that women and girls owe men sex due to society viewing their sexual gratification as more important. This can result in men being more likely than women to view pressuring a woman or girl into sex as acceptable behavior. Examples of Western men’s sexual entitlement include harassing women with thick breasts and their refusal to perform oral sex on women. Non-consensual condom removal has been described as [...] "a threat to [...] bodily agency and as a dignitary harm", and men <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> [...] " [...] justify their actions as a natural male instinct".|$|E
2500|$|Other {{provisions}} {{relating to}} images forbade Christian slave-owners from allowing their pagan slaves {{to keep their}} personal idols, or [...] "if this is impossible to enforce, they must at least avoid the idols and remain pure. [...] If this does not happen, they are alienated from the church" [...] (Canon 41). [...] Canon 60 says [...] "If someone smashes an idol and is then punished by death, {{he or she may}} not be placed in the list of martyrs, since such action is not sanctioned by the Scriptures or by the apostles." [...] Canon 34 says [...] "Candles are not to be burned in a cemetery during the day. [...] This practice is related to paganism and is harmful to Christians. [...] Those <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> are to be denied the communion of the church". [...] Other canons imposed [...] "the rigorous form of fasting" [...] every Saturday (Canon 26), forbade the baptism of chariot racers or stage performers (Canon 62), and many tightly control the reception of former pagan priests into the Christian church and clergy (Canons, 2,3,4,55).|$|E

It is the captain's {{business}} to navigate the ship across the ocean, but {{he has nothing to}} do with directing her when she is going in and out of the harbor." [...] The gentleman then went on to explain that at the entrances of all rivers and harbors there were usually rocks, shoals, sand bars, and other obstructions, some of which were continually shifting their position and character, and making it necessary that they should be studied and known thoroughly by some one who is all the time upon the spot. The men <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> are called pilots. The pilots of each port form a company, and have established rules and regulations for governing all their proceedings. They go out to the mouth of the harbor in small vessels called pilot boats, where they wait, both in sunshine and storm, for ships to come in. When a ship approaches the coast and sees one of these pilot boats, it makes a signal for a pilot to come on board. The pilot boat then sails toward the ship, and when they get near enough they let down a small boat, and row one of the pilots on board the vessel, and he guides the ship in. In the same manner, in going out of port, the pilot guides the ship until they get out into deep water, and then a pilot boat comes up and takes him off the ship. The ship then proceeds to sea, while the pilot boat continues to sail to and fro about the mouth of the harbor, till another ship appears.|$|E
