5|$|Surnames that mention {{animals can}} also be toponymic, the names Horscroft, Horsfall, Horsley and Horstead for example all {{denoting}} people who came from these villages associated <b>with</b> <b>horses.</b> The surname Horseman (1226 onwards) {{on the other hand}} is a metonym for a rider, mounted warrior, or horse-dealer, while the surnames Horse and Horsnail could either be nicknames or metonyms for workers <b>with</b> <b>horses</b> and shoers of horses respectively.|$|E
5|$|Although {{machinery}} {{has replaced}} horses {{in many parts}} of the world, an estimated 100million horses, donkeys and mules are still used for agriculture and transportation in less developed areas. This number includes around 27million working animals in Africa alone. Some land management practices such as cultivating and logging can be efficiently performed <b>with</b> <b>horses.</b> In agriculture, less fossil fuel is used and increased environmental conservation occurs over time with the use of draft animals such as horses. Logging <b>with</b> <b>horses</b> can result in reduced damage to soil structure and less damage to trees due to more selective logging.|$|E

5|$|Congress {{declared}} war in June 1812, and after its adjournment, Johnson returned to Kentucky to recruit volunteers. So many men responded that he chose only those <b>with</b> <b>horses,</b> {{and raised a}} body of mounted rifles. Johnson recruited 300 men, divided into three companies, who elected him major. They merged with another battalion, forming a regiment of 500 men, with Johnson as colonel.|$|E

5|$|Height is not {{the sole}} {{criterion}} for distinguishing horses from ponies. Breed registries for horses that typically produce individuals both under and over 14.2h consider all animals of that breed to be horses regardless of their height. Conversely, some pony breeds may have features in common <b>with</b> <b>horses,</b> and individual animals may occasionally mature at over 14.2h, but are still considered to be ponies.|$|E

5|$|According to Josiffe's account, a {{homosexual}} liaison with Thorpe began that same evening, at Thorpe's mother's home in Oxted, and continued for several years. Thorpe, while acknowledging that a friendship developed, denied any sexual dimension in the relationship. He organised accommodation for Josiffe in London, and a longer-term {{stay with a}} family in Barnstaple, within the North Devon constituency. He paid for advertisements in Country Life magazine, {{in an effort to}} find work <b>with</b> <b>horses</b> for his friend, arranged various temporary jobs, and promised to help Josiffe to realise an ambition to study dressage in France. On the basis of Josiffe's claim that his father had died in an air crash, Thorpe's solicitors investigated whether any money was due, but found that Albert Josiffe was alive and well in Orpington.|$|E
5|$|After 1492, {{a global}} {{exchange}} of previously local {{crops and livestock}} breeds occurred. Maize, potatoes, sweet potatoes and manioc were the key crops that spread from the New World to the Old, while varieties of wheat, barley, rice and turnips traveled from the Old World to the New. There had been few livestock species in the New World, <b>with</b> <b>horses,</b> cattle, sheep and goats being completely unknown before their arrival with Old World settlers. Crops moving in both directions across the Atlantic Ocean caused population growth {{around the world and}} a lasting effect on many cultures. Maize and cassava were introduced from Brazil into Africa by Portuguese traders in the 16th century, becoming staple foods, replacing native African crops.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} in their history, not clearly documented, horses bred in the western regions {{crossbred}} <b>with</b> <b>horses</b> that originated south of the Gulf of Finland. This made the western Finnish horse type larger and better suited to farming and forestry work. The characteristics of the original western Finnish type prevailed, however, even though influenced by outside blood and traces of outside influence could be detected for a long time. Later, this mixed type was further crossbred with larger horses from Central Europe during the Middle Ages. Foreign horses were also brought to Finland during military campaigns, and additional animals were imported to manor houses for driving. The crossbreed offspring of Central European and Finnish horses were larger than their Finnish parents, and even more suited for agricultural work.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{influence}} of the later Habsburg families, who ruled in both Spain and other nations of Europe, the Andalusian was crossbred <b>with</b> <b>horses</b> of Central Europe and the Low Countries and thus was closely related to many breeds that developed, including the Neapolitan horse, Groningen, Lipizzaner and Kladruber. Spanish horses have been used extensively in classical dressage in Germany since the 16th century. They thus influenced many German breeds, including the Hanoverian, Holstein, East Friesian and Oldenburg. Dutch breeds such as the Friesian and Gelderland also contain significant Spanish blood, as do Danish breeds such as the Fredericksborg and Knabstrupper.|$|E
5|$|Folklorist Gary R. Varner has {{suggested}} that the origin of the belief in water horses that preyed on and devoured humans may be a reflection of the human sacrifices once made to appease the gods of water. The association <b>with</b> <b>horses</b> may have its roots in horse sacrifices performed in ancient Scandinavia. Stories of malevolent water spirits served the practical purpose of keeping children away from perilous areas of water, and of warning adolescent women to be wary of attractive young strangers. The stories were also used to enforce moral standards, as they implied that the creatures took retribution for bad behaviour carried out on Sundays. The intervention of demons and spirits was possibly a way to rationalise the drowning of children and adults who had accidentally fallen into deep, fast flowing or turbulent water.|$|E
5|$|Heston and Boyd {{both had}} to learn how to drive a chariot. Heston, an {{experienced}} horseman, took daily three-hour lessons in chariot driving after he arrived in Rome and picked up the skill quickly. Heston was outfitted with special contact lenses to prevent the grit kicked up during the race from injuring his eyes. For the other charioteers, six actors with extensive experience <b>with</b> <b>horses</b> were flown in from Hollywood, including Giuseppe Tosi, who had once been a bodyguard for Victor Emmanuel III of Italy.|$|E

5|$|In September 1899, it {{was clear}} that the crisis in South Africa was likely to turn into war. By 2 October, all {{military}} leave had been cancelled, and urgent preparations were under way to send a large expeditionary force to the Cape, <b>with</b> <b>horses</b> and supplies being requisitioned and mobilised. On 7 October, a proclamation was issued calling out the Army Reserve. Of 65,000 liable men, around 25,000 were intended to be called up for service. The Second Boer War broke out on 11 October.|$|E
5|$|Isolationist Paraguay {{was more}} {{difficult}} to win over. Brazil made the initial overtures, becoming the first country to formally recognise Paraguayan independence in 1844. This soon led {{to the establishment of}} excellent diplomatic relations. The Brazilian ambassador in Paraguay, Pimenta Bueno, became a private councilor to President Carlos Antonio López. A defensive alliance was signed on 25 December 1850 between Brazil and Paraguay, in which López agreed to supply the Empire <b>with</b> <b>horses</b> for its army. But Paraguay refused to contribute troops to fight Rosas, believing that Justo José Urquiza (who had invaded Uruguay in 1839 and in 1845), the ruler of the Argentine Entre Rios province, secretly wished to annex Paraguay.|$|E
5|$|People of {{all ages}} with {{physical}} and mental disabilities obtain beneficial results from association <b>with</b> <b>horses.</b> Therapeutic riding is used to mentally and physically stimulate disabled persons and help them improve their lives through improved balance and coordination, increased self-confidence, and a greater feeling of freedom and independence. The benefits of equestrian activity {{for people with disabilities}} has also been recognized with the addition of equestrian events to the Paralympic Games and recognition of para-equestrian events by the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI). Hippotherapy and therapeutic horseback riding are names for different physical, occupational, and speech therapy treatment strategies that utilize equine movement. In hippotherapy, a therapist uses the horse's movement to improve their patient's cognitive, coordination, balance, and fine motor skills, whereas therapeutic horseback riding uses specific riding skills.|$|E
