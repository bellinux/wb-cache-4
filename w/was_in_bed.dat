5|$|According to his autobiography, it {{was while}} he <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> with a fever that Wallace thought about Thomas Malthus's idea of {{positive}} checks on human population growth {{and came up with}} the idea of natural selection. Wallace said in his autobiography that he was on the island of Ternate at the time; but historians have questioned this, saying that on the basis of the journal he kept at the time, he was on the island of Gilolo. From 1858 to 1861 he rented a house on Ternate from the Dutchman Maarten Dirk van Renesse van Duivenbode. He used this house as a base camp for expeditions to other islands such as Gilolo.|$|E
5|$|In Blessing, Tennessee, Jared Chirp, while {{attempting}} to flee his home, is attacked by rattlesnakes inside his car and killed. Federal agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), after conferring with the completely ordinary Reverend Mackey, go to Reverend Enoch O'Connor's church, Church of God with Signs and Wonders, where Biblical literalism is stressed and snakes are used during his services. As such, O'Connor becomes the prime suspect. Later, a woman named Iris tells Reverend Mackey that she feels guilty because Jared called her on the night he died in order {{to talk to his}} girlfriend, Gracie. Iris, however, refused because Gracie <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed.</b> Later that night, Iris is bitten when her staple remover turns into a snake; she promptly goes into the bathroom to clean up but is killed when snakes appear everywhere in the bathroom.|$|E

500|$|A {{larger than}} life character, Miller {{is the subject of}} many stories, often apocryphal. One story had Don Bradman {{answering}} {{a knock on the door}} late one night to see Miller dressed in a dinner suit. Miller advised Bradman that, as demanded, he <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> at curfew and was now going out. His relationship with Bradman was one riddled with friction and mutual antipathy, [...] "...one a roundhead of massive influence, the other a cavalier and maverick". As Bradman moved from batting hero and team captain to selector and administrator, his influence grew; this [...] "...almost certainly cost Miller any chance of captaining his country".|$|E

Catharine MacKinnon, Dworkin's {{longtime friend and}} collaborator, published a column in the New York Times, celebrating what she described as Dworkin's [...] "incandescent literary and political career", suggested that Dworkin deserved a nomination for the Nobel Prize in Literature, and complained that [...] "lies about her views on sexuality (that she believed intercourse was rape) and her political alliances (that she <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> with the right) were published and republished without attempts at verification, corrective letters almost always refused. Where the physical appearance of male writers is regarded as irrelevant or cherished as a charming eccentricity, Andrea's was reviled and mocked and turned into pornography. When she sued for libel, courts trivialized the pornographic lies as fantasy and dignified them as satire".|$|E

I remember he said to me I was the only person he knew who would set up a white silk tent for him. I was rather surprised when we were driving back to LA on Sunday evening, he stopped at a florist to buy some flowers for his wife." [...] In November 1950, Northrup attempted suicide by taking sleeping pills. Hubbard blamed Klowden for the suicide bid and told her to forget about him and the Foundation, but resumed the affair with her again within a month.|$|E

Upon completion, MGM invited Benchley {{to write and}} perform in a short production inspired by a Mellon Institute study on sleep commissioned by the Simmons Mattress Company. The resulting film, How to Sleep, was filmed in two days, and featured Benchley as both the narrator and sleeper, the latter a role Benchley claimed was [...] "not much of a strain, as [...] <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> most of the time." [...] The film was well received in preview screenings, and promotions took over, with a still from the film being used in Simmons advertisements. The only group not pleased was the Mellon Institute, who did not approve of the studio mocking their study.|$|E

Although he was not gregarious, he formed several close friendships with associates such as Charles Young, Paul Laurence Dunbar, John Hope and Mary White Ovington. His closest friend was Joel Spingarn– a white man– but Du Bois never accepted Spingarn's offer to be on a first name basis. Du Bois was something of a dandy– he dressed formally, carried a walking stick, and walked with an air of confidence and dignity. He was relatively short, standing at , and always maintained a well-groomed mustache and goatee. He enjoyed singing and playing tennis.|$|E

500|$|On 13 April 1943 the {{committee}} of the Chiefs of Staff met and agreed that they thought the plan should proceed. The committee informed Colonel John Bevan – the head of London Controlling Section, which controlled the planning and co-ordination of deception operations – {{that he needed to}} obtain final approval from Churchill. Two days later Bevan met the prime minister – who <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed,</b> wearing a dressing gown and smoking a cigar – in his rooms at the Cabinet War offices and explained the plan. He warned Churchill that there were several aspects that could go wrong, including that the Spaniards might pass the corpse back to the British, with the papers unread. Churchill replied that [...] "in that case we shall have to get the body back and give it another swim". Churchill gave his approval to the operation, but delegated the final confirmation to Eisenhower, the overall military commander in the Mediterranean, whose plan to invade Sicily would be affected. Bevan sent an encrypted telegram to Eisenhower's headquarters in Algeria requesting final confirmation, which was received on 17 April.|$|E
500|$|The Gentlemen, {{called the}} [...] "creepiest villains we've ever done" [...] by series writer Doug Petrie, were {{inspired}} by a nightmare Whedon had as a child, specifically {{one in which he}} <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> and approached by a floating monster. Whedon fashioned The Gentlemen as something from a Brothers Grimm fairy tale, intending them to be frightening to children — monsters who carve out people's hearts, smiling as they do so. Nosferatu, Pinhead from Hellraiser, and Mr. Burns from The Simpsons all served as physical models for The Gentlemen. Elegantly Victorian in costume and demeanor, Whedon found their politeness and grace especially unsettling. Their metallic teeth {{were inspired by}} the intersection of Victorian culture with the height of the Industrial age, an era that Whedon considers [...] "classically creepy". For Buffy studies scholar Rhonda Wilcox, The Gentlemen and their straitjacket-wearing minions, who clumsily flap, gyrate, and crouch as they move, are representative of class disparity and patriarchy: The Gentlemen, with their Victorian suits, move effortlessly to accomplish what they set out to do while their minions, whom Whedon called [...] "footmen", do the [...] "dirty work".|$|E
