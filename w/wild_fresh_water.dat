40|$|Abstract- Characterization of the {{helminth}} parasites of {{wild fish}} has a considerable importance {{from the point}} of view of hygiene and public health, as well as from its taxonomic interest. To study the pathogenecity of parasites in the field of fisheries, require detail knowledge of the parasites inhabiting localities involved. Present study aimed to investigate the intestinal nematodes from the Puntius species inhabiting Nilwala river basin, Sri Lanka and to evaluate their population levels in host populations. Eight host fish species were surveyed and two spirurid nematodes, Camallanus fotedari from Puntius dorsalis and P. titteya and Rhabdochona sarana from P. filamentosus and P. sarana, were recovered. C. fotedari was found inhabiting in low infection levels in its two hosts, and it, however had a relatively high preference to P. dorsalis (20 %) than P. titteya (4. 2 %). Of the two host species of R. sarana, high prevalence, mean intensity and abundance were reported in P. filamentosus (syn. Dawkinsia singhala) compared with those of in P. sarana (syn. Systomus sarana). Occurrence of these two spirurid nematode, C. fotedari and R. sarana, parasitizing in <b>wild</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> fishes is a new records to Sri Lanka...|$|E

Salt-water adapted turtles {{were exposed to}} <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> for 4 d before being returned to salt water. During the initial salt water phase, absolute and relative water flux rates were 1. 2 +/- 0. 1 l d(- 1) and 123. 0 +/- 6. 8 ml kg(- 1) d(- 1), respectively. When turtles were exposed to <b>fresh</b> <b>water,</b> rates increased by approximately 30 %. Upon return to salt water, rates decreased to original levels.

50|$|Changing {{landscape}} {{for the use}} of agriculture has a great effect on the flow of <b>fresh</b> <b>water.</b> Changes in landscape by the removal of trees and soils changes the flow of <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> in the local environment and also affects the cycle of <b>fresh</b> <b>water.</b> As a result, more <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> is stored in the soil which benefits agriculture.

40|$|During glacial periods, {{atmospheric}} CO 2 concentration {{increases and}} decreases by around 15 ppm. At the same time, the climate changes gradually in Antarctica. Such climate {{changes can be}} simulated in models when the AMOC (Atlantic Meridional Oceanic Circulation) is weakened by adding <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> to the North Atlantic. The impact on the carbon cycle is less straightforward, and previous studies give opposite results. Because the models and the <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> fluxes were different in these studies, it prevents any direct comparison and hinders finding whether the discrepancies arise from using different models or different <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> fluxes. In this study we use the CLIMBER- 2 coupled climate carbon model to explore the impact of different <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> fluxes. In both preindustrial and glacial states, the addition of <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> and the resulting slow-down of the AMOC lead to an uptake of carbon by the ocean and a release by the terrestrial biosphere. The duration, shape and amplitude of the <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> flux all {{have an impact on}} the change of atmospheric CO 2 because they modulate the change of the AMOC. The maximum CO 2 change linearly depends on the time integral of the AMOC change. The different duration, amplitude, and shape of the <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> flux cannot explain the opposite evolution of ocean and vegetation carbon inventory in different models. The different CO 2 evolution thus depends on the AMOC response to the addition of <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> and the resulting climatic change, which are both model dependent. In CLIMBER- 2, the rise of CO 2 recorded in ice cores during abrupt events can be simulated under glacial conditions, especially when the sinking of brines in the Southern Ocean is taken into account.
