25|$|Picture {{a series}} of water pipes, fitting into a network. Each pipe is of a certain diameter, so it can only {{maintain}} a flow of {{a certain amount of}} water. Anywhere that pipes meet, the total amount of water coming into that junction must be equal to the amount going out, otherwise we would quickly run out of water, or we would have a buildup of water. We have a <b>water</b> <b>inlet,</b> which is the source, and an outlet, the sink. A flow would then be one possible way for water to get from source to sink so that the total amount of water coming out of the outlet is consistent. Intuitively, the total flow of a network is the rate at which water comes out of the outlet.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{effects of}} treated and {{untreated}} <b>water</b> <b>inlets</b> with macrophytes on {{the improvement of}} water quality and zooplankton community were evaluated in a fish pond with continuous water flow. Water and zooplankton samples were retrieved at four sites during nine months. There were differences (p< 0. 01) between <b>inlet</b> <b>water</b> from fish pond and <b>inlet</b> <b>water</b> from canal with macrophytes, featuring higher concentrations of nutrient load, mainly TAN and TP in the former. The <b>inlet</b> <b>water</b> from fish pond contained a higher number of abundant species (9 species), whilst the water supply from the canal with macrophytes had a greater richness (31 species) of zooplankton species. Results showed that <b>inlet</b> <b>water</b> without macrophytes directly affected {{the characteristics of the}} water column and the dominance of zooplankton species such as Thermocyclops decipiens, and greater abundance of Rotifera species. Since aquatic plants in the <b>inlet</b> <b>water</b> of fish pond analyzed showed lower allochthonous material loads from the previous fish pond, the management adopted with macrophytes may be applied to avoid eutrophication risks, common in farm ponds...|$|R

2500|$|After {{the loss}} of Shuangyu, the smugglers {{scattered}} {{along the coast of}} Zhejiang and Fujian to find good hideouts to trade. The deep <b>water</b> <b>inlet</b> of Zoumaxi (走馬溪, [...] "Running Horse Creek") by the Dongshan Peninsula near the Fujian-Guangdong border was found to be a suitable place for trade since the terrain sheltered the ships from the winds, and the inhabitants of nearby Meiling (梅嶺) had been greatly involved in the illicit trade. On 19 March 1549, Lu Tang and Ke Qiao ambushed two junks in Zoumaxi while they were trading with the Portuguese aboard resulting in 33 deaths and 206 smugglers captured. Among the captured were Li Guangtou and a number of Portuguese men, and Lu Tang had four of the more good-looking Portuguese pretend to be kings of Malacca {{in order to make the}} victory seem more complete. Fearing that the captives might bribe their way out, Zhu Wan executed 96 of the Chinese smugglers using his discretionary powers.|$|E

40|$|When {{searching for}} the optimum {{condenser}} cooling water flow in a thermal power plant with natural draft cooling towers, {{it is essential to}} evaluate the outlet water temperature of cooling towers when the cooling <b>water</b> flow and <b>inlet</b> <b>water</b> temper-ature change. However, the air outlet temperature and tower draft or inlet air ve-locity are strongly coupled for natural draft cooling towers. Traditional methods, such as trial and error method, graphic method and iterative methods are not sim-ple and efficient enough to be used for plant practice. In this paper, we combine Merkel equation with draft equation, and develop the coupled description for per-formance evaluation of natural draft cooling towers. This model contains two in-puts: the cooling <b>water</b> flow, the <b>inlet</b> cooling <b>water</b> temperature and two outputs: the outlet <b>water</b> temperature, the <b>inlet</b> air velocity, equivalent to tower draft. In this model, we furthermore put forward a soft-sensing algorithm to calculate the total drag coefficient instead of empirical correlations. Finally, we design an iterative approach to solve this coupling model, and illustrate three cases to prove that the coupling model and solving approach proposed in our paper are effective for cool-ing tower performance evaluation.
