The film was a US box-office failure and many reviews, particularly those for Ball, were particularly brutal; the movie has a 29% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Time Magazine said, [...] "The movie spans about 20 years, and seems that long in running time [...] [...] [...] Miss Ball has been molded over the years {{into some sort of}} national monument, and she performs like one too. Her grace, her timing, her vigor have all vanished." [...] Time Out London declared she [...] "simply hasn't the drive and steel of a Rosalind Russell, an Angela Lansbury or a Ginger Rogers, all of whom played the part before her," [...] and said of Saks, [...] "When he's not ogling his star in perpetual soft focus and a $300,000 fashion parade, [...] fails to get enough retakes, match his shots, or inject the essential vim." [...] Pauline Kael in The New Yorker wondered, [...] "After forty years in movies and TV, did she discover in herself an unfulfilled ambition to be a flaming drag queen?" [...] The New Republics Stanley Kauffman, though he pointed out that Ball would have made a perfect Mame had she played the role [...] "fifteen years earlier," [...] described her as [...] "too old, too stringy in the legs, too basso in the voice, and too creaky in the joints." [...] Virtually every critic took notice of the heavy-handedness in photographing Ball out of focus, Rex Reed {{going so far as to}} suggest, albeit jokingly, that chicken fat was put over the lens. Some regarded this as evidence that those executives responsible for signing Ball, and Ball herself, knew from the outset that she was too old for her role. In her defense in regards to her lack of singing ability, Ball told one interviewer [...] "Mame stayed up all night and drank champagne! <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> her to sound like? Julie Andrews?" ...|$|E

Then, whimpering again, and at intervals biting the curls, and stopping to look how much was bitten off, 'It's a shame! There never was such a hard case! I shouldn't care so much if it wasn't so ridiculous. It was ridiculous enough to have a stranger coming over to marry me, whether he liked it or not. It was ridiculous enough to know what an embarrassing meeting it would be, and how we never could pretend to have an inclination of our own, either of us. It was ridiculous enough to know I shouldn't like him--how COULD I like him, left to him in a will, like a dozen of spoons, with everything cut and dried beforehand, like orange chips. Talk of orange flowers indeed! I declare again it's a shame! Those ridiculous points would have been smoothed away by the money, for I love money, and want money--want it dreadfully. I hate to be poor, and we are degradingly poor, offensively poor, miserably poor, beastly poor. But here I am, left with all the ridiculous parts of the situation remaining, and, added to them all, this ridiculous dress! And if the truth was known, when the Harmon murder was all over the town, and people were speculating on its being suicide, I dare say those impudent wretches at the clubs and places made jokes about the miserable creature's having preferred a watery grave to me. It's likely enough they took such liberties; I shouldn't wonder! I declare it's a very hard case indeed, and I am a most unfortunate girl. The idea of being a kind of a widow, and never having been married! And the idea of being as poor as ever after all, and going into black, besides, for a man I never saw, and should have hated--as far as HE was concerned--if I had seen!' ...|$|E
