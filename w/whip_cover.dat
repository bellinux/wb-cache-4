6000|$|Mr. Bishopriggs piously {{closed his}} {{available}} eye, {{and held the}} cover firmly on the dish. [...] "For what ye're gaun' to receive, may ye baith be truly thankful!" [...] He opened his available eye, and <b>whipped</b> the <b>cover</b> off again. [...] "My conscience is easy noo. Fall to! Fall to!" ...|$|R
60|$|And {{with this}} final {{expression}} of contempt for Sally's greenness, Aunt Chloe <b>whipped</b> the <b>cover</b> off the bake-kettle, and disclosed {{to view a}} neatly-baked pound-cake, of which no city confectioner need to have been ashamed. This being evidently the central point of the entertainment, Aunt Chloe began now to bustle about earnestly in the supper department.|$|R
6000|$|At Villa Rubein, Herr Paul {{had killed}} the fatted calf for Greta's Fest. When the whole party were assembled, he alone {{remained}} standing; and waving his arm above the cloth, cried: [...] "My dears! Your happiness! There are good things here--Come!" [...] And with a sly look, {{the air of a}} conjurer producing rabbits, he <b>whipped</b> the <b>cover</b> off the soup tureen: ...|$|R
50|$|Exceptions {{to the red}} {{colouring}} {{are those}} carried by the government <b>whips,</b> which are <b>covered</b> in black leather. Discreet black boxes are also available for ministers who need to travel by train.|$|R

[...] Said I to the laddy [...] Driving on the box: [...] "Sir, at Limavaddy." ...|$|R
50|$|Strawberry Festival: Since 1913, the Strawberry Festival {{has been}} a {{tradition}} at Cedar Crest for all incoming students. The entire campus enjoys refreshments including strawberries and <b>whipped</b> cream, chocolate <b>covered</b> strawberries, and strawberry lemonade. The event is held {{on the front lawn}} of the President's home.|$|R
50|$|In 2006 she was {{featured}} on the full-length album Creamy Cocktails & Other Delights with a cover that paid a fun homage to the classic album <b>cover</b> <b>Whipped</b> Cream and Other Delights by Herb Alpert. Her title song from this album was included as the main anthem in the same-sex marriage rights movie, I Want to Get Married.|$|R
50|$|In 1920 a baker from The Hague called Henri van der Zijde took {{up shop in}} {{the same}} street on number 25 and invented a {{variation}} filled with <b>whipped</b> cream and <b>covered</b> with real chocolate, which his heirs see as the first real Bossche Bol. In the twenties Lambermont started selling a chocolate ball much like this one.|$|R
5000|$|An icebox cake (American) or {{chocolate}} ripple cake/log (Australian) is {{a dessert}} consisting {{of whipped cream}} and chocolate wafers. The back-of-the-box recipe on Nabisco Famous Chocolate Wafers indicates that the wafers are stacked to form a log with whipped cream cementing them together, and then the log is laid on its side. A second log is formed and the two are set side-by-side and more <b>whipped</b> cream <b>covers</b> the exterior. The cake is then left overnight in the refrigerator (or [...] "icebox"). The wafers absorb moisture from the whipped cream and the whole can be served in slices. The dessert is usually served by cutting it into slices at a 45-degree angle, so bands of chocolate and cream are visible across each slice. The traditional wafers are the thin and dark Nabisco Famous Chocolate Wafers, {{but they may be}} hard to find in some areas so other cookies are sometimes substituted.|$|R
5000|$|The candy {{is made of}} a <b>whipped</b> nougat filling <b>covered</b> {{with milk}} {{chocolate}}. The nougat chocolate center is first formed into very large slabs, which are cut to size, and after the centers are formed they are coated with milk chocolate through a process called [...] "enrobing" [...] wherein the centers pass through a continuous flowing vertical [...] "sheet" [...] of chocolate while, at the same time, a rotating, chocolate-covered wheel beneath the mesh belt coats {{the base of the}} bar. The bar is then cooled and prepared for wrapping. The candy is made in Chicago, Illinois; Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania; and Newmarket, Ontario.|$|R
2500|$|In 1501, Maximilian {{fell from}} {{his horse and}} badly injured his leg, causing him pain {{for the rest of}} his life. Some historians have {{suggested}} that Maximilian was [...] "morbidly" [...] depressed: From 1514, he travelled everywhere with his coffin. Maximilian died in Wels, Upper Austria, and was succeeded as Emperor by his grandson Charles V, his son Philip the Handsome having died in 1506. For penitential reasons, Maximilian gave very specific instructions for the treatment of his body after death. He wanted his hair to be cut off and his teeth knocked out, and the body was to be <b>whipped</b> and <b>covered</b> with lime and ash, wrapped in linen, and [...] "publicly displayed to show the perishableness of all earthly glory". Although he is buried in the Castle Chapel at Wiener Neustadt, an extremely elaborate cenotaph tomb for Maximilian is in the Hofkirche, Innsbruck, where the tomb is surrounded by statues of heroes from the past. Much of the work was done in his lifetime, but it was not completed until decades later.|$|R
50|$|The joy of {{the reunion}} of the two came to naught when Yingtai told Shanbo he was three months too late. Her father had already betrothed her to the {{frivolous}} son of the powerful and wealthy Ma family. Shanbo, who was already ailing, was deeply grieved. He returned home and his health steadily deteriorated. Several days before her wedding day, he asked to see her again. When his servant returned instead with a token from her, it was the final blow. He sent his servant to Yingtai with a last gift and died. Yingtai was stricken with sorrow and forced her father {{to come to a}} compromise: to allow her to visit Shanbo's tomb on the way to her betrothed's home or she would not marry. At the tomb, she swore her undying love for Shanbo and that if they could not be together in life, she would rather be with him in death. A tornado sprang up and an earthquake split the tomb in two whereupon Yingtai threw herself into it. The <b>whipping</b> winds <b>covered</b> the tomb with sand. After the winds died down, two residual pieces of cloth from Yingtai's mourning clothes transform into two butterflies, and flutter away to the heavens.|$|R
500|$|Larter first {{appeared}} in the media when she portrayed the fictional character of Allegra Coleman in the November 1996 issue of Esquire. The magazine, which billed Coleman as the movies' next dream girl, told of Allegra's relationship with David Schwimmer, how Quentin Tarantino broke up with Mira Sorvino to date her, and how Woody Allen overhauled a film to give her a starring role. When the magazine was published, Esquire received hundreds of phone calls about the non-existent Coleman and various talent agencies sought to represent her, even after the hoax was revealed. Larter herself received a considerable amount of attention after the cover; she received phone calls from morning TV shows and others for interviews. The Esquire cover led Larter to a role on Varsity Blues. One particular scene where Larter's character, Darcy Sears, wears nothing but <b>whipped</b> cream to <b>cover</b> herself has become a media favorite. It has been referenced a number of times in the media including on MTV's Jersey Shore where one character refers to it as the [...] "Varsity Blues outfit". The scene also made Maxim list of Earth-Shattering Nude Scenes at #9.|$|R
50|$|Brooke later {{had a short}} {{marriage}} to a man named Grant Chambers in 1995 after her attempts at blackmailing Ridge into leaving Taylor for her failed, and she put Grant {{in charge of the}} company. In 1998, Taylor became pregnant with Ridge's child; however, she told everyone the baby belonged to Thorne after seeing who she believed to be Ridge in bed with Brooke. In reality, Brooke conned a drunken Ridge into her bed and Ridge rebuked her. Brooke later became interested in Thorne and overcame obstacles with him and his then wife, Macy. Macy was killed in a car accident, which Brooke survived. Thorne and Brooke parted ways, and she turned her attention back to Ridge, who was still married to Taylor. Brooke was later tricked by the Forrester family into traveling to Paris to keep away from the happily married Taylor and Ridge (who had since had twins, Steffy and Phoebe). After she came back, Brooke had an affair with her daughter Bridget's husband, Deacon Sharpe. Bridget was disgusted by this, and later Brooke gave birth to a daughter named Hope Logan {{as a result of the}} scandalous affair. Briefly during the pregnancy, she married a Forrester co-worker <b>Whip</b> Jones to <b>cover</b> up her adulterous affair.|$|R
