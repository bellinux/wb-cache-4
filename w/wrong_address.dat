It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 13, 2011, and was seen by around 7.5 million people during this broadcast. In the episode, Homer feels left out when Marge, Bart, and Lisa join a group of foodies. Their personal blog quickly becomes popular and the trio is invited to a molecular gastronomy restaurant. Feeling pity toward Homer, Marge invites him along. However, after beginning to worry that he will reclaim his position as the parent perceived as the most fun by the children, she sends him to the <b>wrong</b> <b>address.</b> Homer unknowingly arrives at a meth lab, where a gunfight starts as the police burst in.|$|E

Homer, Bart, Lisa, Bourdain, and other famous chefs that have shown up, such as Mario Batali, then jump away from Marge on hop balls, leaving her by herself. Afterwards, Gordon Ramsay appears next to her, using profanity while telling her that she should not have invited Homer.

Rabin came up with the chorus and bridge a few months prior to meeting Squire and White for the first time. Kaye wrote its keyboard introduction, Rabin developed a melody from it, and Anderson developed its counter-melody.|$|E

60|$|The {{smuggling}} trade flourished greatly at that period, {{and there}} were receivers and distributors of smuggled wine, spirits, and other commodities in every town and in very many villages throughout the county {{in spite of its}} distance from the sea-coast. One of his memories is of a blind man of the village, or town as it was then, who was used as an assistant in this business. He had lost his sight in childhood, one eye having been destroyed by a ferret which got into his cradle; then, when he was about six years old he was running across the room one day with a fork it his hand when he stumbled, and falling on the floor had the other eye pierced by the prongs. But in spite of his blindness he became a good worker, and could make a fence, reap, trim hedges, feed the animals, and drive a horse as well as any man. His father had a small farm and was a carrier as well, a quiet, sober, industrious man who was never suspected by his neighbours of being a smuggler, for he never left his house and work, but from time to time he had little consignments of rum and brandy in casks received on a dark night and carefully stowed away in his manure heap and in a pit under the floor of his pigsty. Then the blind son would drive his old mother in the carrier's cart to Bath and call at a dozen or twenty private houses, leaving parcels which had been already ordered and paid for--a gallon of brandy at one, two or four gallons of rum at another, and so on, until all was got rid of, and on the following day they would return with goods to Hindon. This quiet little business went on satisfactorily for some years, during which the officers of the excise had stared a thousand times with their eagle's eyes at the quaint old woman in her poke bonnet and shawl, driven by a blind man with a vacant face, and had suspected nothing, when a little mistake was made and a jar of brandy delivered at a <b>wrong</b> <b>address.</b> The recipient was an honest gentleman, and in his anxiety to find the rightful owner of the brandy made extensive inquiries in his neighbourhood, and eventually the excisemen got wind of the affair, and on the very next visit of the old woman and her son to Bath they were captured. After an examination before a magistrate the son was discharged on account of his blindness, but the cart and horses, as well as the smuggled spirits, were confiscated, and the poor blind man had to make his way on foot to Hindon.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a point prevalent evaluation of the comparative reliability and validity of age-sex registers, practice medical records and family practitioner committee (FPC) registers from five teaching practices. They all exhibited similar levels of acceptable accuracy for patient names, sex and age, but the distribution of <b>wrong</b> <b>addresses</b> varied greatly: practice medical records 3 · 9 per cent, age-sex registers 8 · 2 per cent and FPC registers 17 · 1 per cent. The presence of a patient entry in all three registers was associated {{with a high degree of}} probability (95 · 3 per cent) that this individual would be a bona fide practice patient. The register population inflation rates were FPC records 5 · 5 per cent, practice records 9 · 8 per cent and age-sex registers 10 · 6 per cent, but there were large variations between individual practices. A statistically significant contribution to inflation rates came from the age groups 0 to 1 and 21 to 40 (p< 0 · 0005). The register population deflation rates were minimal. The significance of these findings is discussed and the need for practices to determine the accuracy of their individual age-sex registers is stressed. A convenient and economic method for so doing is suggested. We also suggest ways of making it easier to construct and use age-sex registers, since they can be a most versatile and useful aid to research in general practice...|$|R

40|$|Indexación: Web of Science; Scopus; Scielo. Pap smear {{coverage}} in Chile has gradually decreased {{in the last}} years, from 67 % to 59 %, making it necessary to determine the causes of this decline. Aim: To analyze {{the relationship between the}} characteristics of the cervical cancer screening target population in the public health care system and the percentage of PAP coverage. Material and Methods: This study was carried out in women aged between 25 and 64 years, belonging to a public health care system and registered in any of the eight primary healthcare centers of a Metropolitan Santiago low income community. The analysis considered information from the recruitment database (n = 6, 058) and interviewed women database (n = 1, 042). Results: In 52 % of cases there were difficulties in recruiting women, mainly due to <b>wrong</b> <b>addresses.</b> Among contacted women, 4. 1 % had a hysterectomy or had cervical cancer and 1. 4 % were dead. When analyzing the variable “adherence to cervical cancer screening” in the interviewed women, 76. 8 % reported to comply with the ministerial guidelines. From that group, 20. 5 % reported to attend screening at the private health care system. Seventy seven percent of women who had timely screening visits, reported attending screening periodically every 3 years or less. Conclusions: Pap smear coverage must be analyzed considering the different factors that affect it. Among the latter, the exclusion of some women from the target population and performing the screening in private clinics stand out. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|M. A. (Social Work) Lack of {{appropriate}} facilities for the mildly mentally disabled {{children in the}} black communities of the Witwatersrand {{was a source of}} concern for parents. These parents did not want their children to attend the "training centres for the mentally handicapped children" as they felt their children functioned above the criteria used at these centres. Some parents, as a result, choose to keep their children at home. This study was undertaken to research the hypothesis that mildly mentally disabled children could benefit from educational facilities and programs. Respondents were parents of the affected children and teachers from the training centres in Soweto, East Rand and Alexandra. An exploratory study was conducted. Forty teachers administered the questionnaires and trained interviewers assisted 93 parents to complete their questionnaires. Problems were encountered due to <b>wrong</b> <b>addresses</b> (many houses were then unnumbered in Soweto) and reluctance from some respondents to participate. The results confirmed the hypothesis as both teachers and parents felt that alternative facilities to the training centres were needed for the mildly mentally disabled children, that teachers should be qualified in that special field of teaching, and more contact between teachers and parents was recommended, A multi-disciplinary approach in the treatment program was also an important factor, unfortunately none of the centres had more than three professionals. Social workers were used by other professionals to provide services from the birth of the disabled child as support systems, catalysts and advisers to parents. The social worker's role is to educate, empower, support, mediate, liaise with the external resources and nurture the person to independence and self-reliance...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is the {{optimization}} of logistic processes in the system of forwarding services. This work focuses on a company GLS Czech Republic. The company was formed by grouping several carriers in Germany in 1999 which has further expanded throughout Europe. In March 2005, Hungarian GLS decided {{to establish a branch}} in the Czech Republic and since then, 16 other branches have been built. Nowadays, GLS provides several types of delivering services which can be divided into classical services and services with added value. Classical services include Business-Parcel (of max. 40 kilos) and Express-Parcel (which must be delivered by 12 : 00). Value added services include signed on delivery shipment, collecting shipments and shipment with exact delivery time. The theoretical part deals with interpretation of the concept of logistic, its history and development. It focuses on the terminology such as logistic chain and logistic elements and their use in shipping services, further on transport and finally on shipping itself. The logistic processes in the company were inspected and evaluated. The used methods include observing, structural questionnaires and guided interview. Additional information was obtained from internal documents, especially reports of delivered consignments, audit, internal manuals and emails. The practical part mapped the current situation in the company. Several failings have been found, the biggest one is communication with the switchboard which is insufficient and in some cases non-functional. Other critical parts include labelling, shipping to <b>wrong</b> <b>addresses,</b> payment by credit card, technical condition of vehicles, main transhipment and staff training.
