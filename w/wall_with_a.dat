5|$|The Yale Union Laundry Building, {{also known}} as the Yale Laundry Building, the City Linen Supply Co. Building, Perfect Fit Manufacturing and simply Yale Union (YU), in {{southeast}} Portland, Oregon, is a two-story commercial structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Built largely of brick in 1908, and embellished with Italian Revival and Egyptian Revival decorations, it was added to the register in 2007. Two-story additions in 1927 and 1929 changed the original building into an L-shaped structure that shares a party <b>wall</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> commercial building to the east.|$|E

5|$|The castle {{comprises}} {{a rectangular}} courtyard {{surrounded by a}} curtain <b>wall,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> tower house, or keep, at one corner, and the round Glassin Tower projecting from the opposite corner. The foundations of demolished ranges of buildings remain around {{two sides of the}} courtyard. Of the outer court, only an earth bank shows the position of the walls, with fragmentary remains of a bakehouse the only visible structures.|$|E
5|$|The city of Vijithapura, {{which the}} Mahavamsa {{refers to as}} Vijitha Nagara, had been founded nearly three hundred {{years ago by the}} brother in law of king Panduvasudeva. By the time of the battle, it had become a well-fortified stronghold of Elara. It {{is said to have been}} {{surrounded}} by three moats and a <b>wall</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> height of 18 cubits. The wall had four wrought iron gates on the north, south, east and west. The Rajavaliya describes Vijithapura as a fortress second only to Anuradhapura.|$|E
5|$|Bronze working {{developed}} in Scotland from about 2000 BCE. As elsewhere in Europe, {{it was in}} this period that hillforts of varying size and form were first introduced. Some had timber palisades and others ditches and ramparts. These included the occupation of Eildon hill near Melrose in the Scottish Borders, from around 1000 BCE, which accommodated hundreds of houses on a fortified hilltop. Traprain Law in East Lothian, had a 20-acre enclosure, sectioned in two places west of the summit, made up of a coursed, stone <b>wall</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> rubble core. The occupation of Castle Rock at Edinburgh and Burnswark in Dumfries and Galloway, also date from this time. Additionally, there were much smaller forts that were domestic in scale and which would have housed only one or two families. The function of these forts have been debated, with some stressing their military role and others their importance as symbolic centres of local society.|$|E

5|$|On the 36th lap, Glock's right-rear {{suspension}} failed {{coming out}} of the final corner. He spun through 180 degrees before hitting the pit <b>wall</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> strong rearward impact, with debris flying across the track. The car, pointing the wrong way, rolled to a stop on the grass. A dazed Glock extracted himself before being treated at the medical centre. The safety car was deployed after the accident. When the pit lane opened on lap38, most drivers headed in, including all of the leaders except Hamilton. McLaren believed that Hamilton had enough fuel to stay out, the plan being for him to then rapidly pull away from his heavily-fuelled rivals, after the safety car went in. Hamilton needed to build up enough of a lead to rejoin still in first position, following his final pit stop. This would prove to be very risky, as Massa rejoined in fourth position, fuelled to the finish.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{was formed}} around a court, later called the inner court, {{enclosed}} by a curtain <b>wall</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> circular tower on each corner and a gatehouse at the front; the north-east tower {{was larger than}} the others, perhaps to provide additional defences. Over time the towers acquired their own names: the north-west tower was called the Hazelwell Tower; the north-east the Redcap Tower and the south-west the Lady Tower. The ground fell away sharply on most sides of the castle, but its south and west sides were protected with a wet moat, using a dam fed from a nearby spring using a pipe. The gatehouse had twin towers and a drawbridge.|$|E

Throughout {{the course of the}} video, items such as darts on a dart board, candles, pictures, and even members of the band with their instruments are shown fading in and out. Towards the end of the video, Adam Levine is seen walking through a narrow corridor dragging a guitar with pictures {{on both sides of the}} wall fading in and out. When he reaches the end of the corridor, he is face to face with a <b>wall</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> small light coming out of it and then flings his guitar backwards and then pounds on the wall. The camera then quickly moves to a scene of the band playing and the lights suddenly flickering on.|$|E

5|$|When {{the first}} traffic flowed, crews had not {{finished}} some final tasks, such as painting stripes. Motorists saw a relocation with several mountain cuts built high up the canyon <b>wall,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{view of the}} slide and former lake. The roadbed was not expected to last, as weather conditions had been unfavorable when the asphalt was laid. Two mountain cuts were unstable, requiring several months of work before they could be left unattended. During this time, the state stationed two full-time watches at the cuts, who would close the road while falling rocks were cleared. The cut through Billies Mountain was described by the construction crews as a new, man-made mountain pass.|$|E
5|$|As bronze working {{developed}} from about 2000 BCE, {{there was a}} decline in the building of large new structures, which, with a reduction of the total area under cultivation, suggests a fall in population. From the Early and Middle Bronze Age there is evidence of cellular round houses of stone, as at Jarlshof and Sumburgh on Shetland. At Jarlshof these are oval houses with thick stone walls, which may have been partly subterranean at the earliest period of inhabitation, a technique that provided both structural stability and insulation. There is also evidence of the occupation of crannogs, roundhouses partially or entirely built on artificial islands, usually in lakes, rivers and estuarine waters. They were often constructed of layers of brushwood and rubble. Sometimes they were revetted around the edges with vertical piles and sometimes surfaced with logs of oak. As elsewhere in Europe, hill forts were first introduced in this period, including the occupation of Eildon hill near Melrose in the Scottish Borders, from around 1000 BCE, which accommodated several hundred houses on a fortified hilltop, and Traprain Law in East Lothian, which had a 20-acre enclosure, sectioned in two places west of the summit, made up of a coursed, stone <b>wall</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> rubble core.|$|E
5|$|If {{travelling}} in a North-South direction, the Wicklow Way {{begins in}} Marlay Park, a historic demesne {{on the outskirts}} of Dublin's suburbs laid out in the late 18th century by the La Touches, a family of Huguenot merchants and bankers, and later developed as a public park. The trailhead comprises a map board, beside which is a low <b>wall</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> stone stile through which walkers pass in order to make their first step on the trail. The Way traverses the park, following a wooded shelterbelt along the Little Dargle River, before emerging on the southern side of the park onto College Road. Passing under the M50 motorway, it ascends Kilmashogue Lane and enters the forest recreation area on Kilmashogue mountain. This is the first of many forest plantations, owned by Coillte, that the Wicklow Way passes through. The tree species in this area comprise Sitka spruce, Scots pine and beech. Much of this initial section of the Way is underlain by granite. The trail circles the mountain, emerging onto open moorland near Fairy Castle. This upland heath and bog habitat is dominated by heather, purple moor grass and bog cotton and supports many bird species, including red grouse, meadow pipit and skylark. The Way crosses a saddle between Two Rock mountain and Kilmashogue before descending from a broad ridge between Two Rock and Tibradden Mountain into the valley of Glencullen where it follows the R116 road to the hamlet of Boranaraltry. The road is flanked by hedgerow-bordered farmland. Ascending from Boranaraltry, the trail crests the shoulder of Prince William’s Seat, at which point the Way leaves County Dublin and enters County Wicklow. The habitat here alternates between blanket bog and upland heath. The trail descends {{to the floor of the}} Glencree valley via Curtlestown Wood where it then enters Lackan Wood and crosses the shoulder of Knockree Hill.|$|E

5|$|Stengel, hired {{only days}} before spring training, had but a limited {{opportunity}} to shape his new ballclub. The Dodgers quickly settled into sixth place, {{where they would}} end the season. Stengel, in later years, enjoyed discussing one 1934 game in Philadelphia's Baker Bowl: with Dodger pitcher Boom-Boom Beck ineffective, Stengel {{went out to the}} mound to take out the angry pitcher, who, instead of giving Stengel the baseball, threw it into right field, where it hit the metal <b>wall</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> loud noise. The right fielder, Hack Wilson, lost in thought, heard the boom, assumed the ball had been hit by a batter, and ran to retrieve it and throw it to the infield, to be met by general laughter. Stengel got the last laughs on the Giants as well. The Giants, six games ahead of the Cardinals on Labor Day, dissipated that lead, and with two games in the season were tied with St. Louis—with the final two games against Brooklyn at the Polo Grounds, games played in front of raucous crowds, who well remembered Terry's comments. Brooklyn won both games, while the Cardinals won their two games against the Cincinnati Reds, and won the pennant. Richard Bak, in his biography of Stengel, noted that the victories over the Terry-led Giants represented personal vindication for the Dodger manager.|$|E
