5|$|As of 2016, Line 2 {{was running}} at {{capacity}} with almost 26,000 peak-hour riders. Upgraded signalling <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> more frequent trains and expand peak-hour capacity to almost 33,000 riders by 2031.|$|E

5|$|An {{additional}} two-track {{connection is}} planned between the line toward Lower Manhattan (around 63rd Street) and the IND 63rd Street Line toward Queens using existing bellmouths {{that are at}} 63rd Street and First Avenue. Current plans do not call {{for it to be}} used by regular service, but instead to be used for non-revenue moves and to provide a connection to the Jamaica subway yard. The connection <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> trains to run from the Financial District to Queens if the capacity of the IND Queens Boulevard Line was increased, or if the Queens Bypass was built. Service from Queens via the 63rd Street Tunnel <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> the full capacity of the line south of 63rd Street to be used. Plans include provisions for an extension north under Second Avenue past 125th Street to the Bronx, and an extension south to Brooklyn.|$|E
5|$|Connections {{would be}} made to the BMT Nassau Street Line, the Williamsburg Bridge, and the Manhattan Bridge. The Sixth Avenue Line would also be {{connected}} to the Williamsburg and Manhattan Bridges. The connection between the Nassau Street Line and the Manhattan Bridge south tracks would be eliminated. This <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> thirty additional trains to operate between Midtown Manhattan and Brooklyn.|$|E
5|$|IUPAC {{also has}} a system for giving codes to {{identify}} amino acids and nucleotide bases. IUPAC needed a coding system that represented long sequences of amino acids. This <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> these sequences to be compared {{to try to find}} homologies. These codes can consist of either a one letter code or a three letter code.|$|E

5|$|On January 27, 2010, an {{official}} from the U.S. State Department said that Abdulmutallab's visa was not revoked because federal authorities {{believed that it}} would have compromised a larger investigation. The official, Patrick F. Kennedy, said intelligence officials had told the State Department that letting Abdulmutallab keep his visa <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> a greater chance of exposing the terrorist network.|$|E
5|$|The Dorniers were {{to carry}} twenty 110-lb bombs each {{fitted with a}} fuse that <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> {{function}} if released from 50 feet or higher; the type of bomb previously used by the Staffel had to release from twice this height, making the unit's Do 17s correspondingly more vulnerable to ground fire.|$|E
5|$|The {{line would}} have a track {{connection}} to the IRT Pelham Line at Third Avenue–138th Street {{and there would be}} a branch terminating at Third Avenue–149th Street to permit a transfer to the Third Avenue Elevated in the Bronx. This <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> the elimination of the Third Avenue Elevated south of 149th Street.|$|E

5000|$|The Emery Theatre {{has fallen}} into disuse, {{but there is}} a long-standing {{community}} interest in restoring the historic auditorium as a mid-sized performing venue. A modern restoration of the theatre <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> seating <b>for</b> approximately 1,600 guests.|$|R
5|$|After {{nine days}} {{quartered}} at the capitol, {{the men of}} the 11th New York were moved to the heights near the Insane Asylum to Camp Lincoln. This move <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> easy transport across the Potomac and into Virginia when necessary. While just five miles (8km) from the capitol, the standard of living the men were used to had changed dramatically, as their usual foodstuffs were replaced with beef steak, dry bread, and coffee. Ellsworth wrote to his fiance that they had not had butter in a week.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} two-track connection, tracks ST-1 and ST-2, {{is planned}} between the line toward Lower Manhattan (around 63rd Street) and the IND 63rd Street Line toward Queens using existing bellmouths {{that are at}} 63rd Street and First Avenue. Current plans do not call {{for it to be}} used by regular service, but instead to be used for non-revenue moves, and to provide a connection to the Jamaica Yard maintenance depot. The connection <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> trains to run from the Financial District to Queens if the capacity of the IND Queens Boulevard Line was increased, or if the Queens Super-Express Bypass was built.|$|E
5|$|An {{improved}} {{connection between}} the IRT Lexington Avenue Line and the IRT White Plains Road Line would be built using the tunnel under the Harlem River used by the IRT Pelham Line, and <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> the full use of the capacity on the White Plains Road Line and the Jerome Avenue Line. Eight additional trains per hour would {{be added to the}} White Plains Road Line and fourteen additional trains per hour would be added to the Jerome Avenue Line. The additional service on the Jerome Avenue Line would make use of the third track for express service.|$|E

5|$|Due to a weak mid-level {{anticyclone}} {{over the}} Gulf of Mexico {{that was not}} observed operationally, Mitch began a slow southerly motion on October27, passing very near Guanaja. The NHC had anticipated the movement {{to be part of}} a small loop in the Gulf of Honduras, although the agency noted continued uncertainty. Steadily deteriorating, Mitch weakened below major hurricane intensity late on October28, due to land interaction, upwelling, and possibly an eyewall replacement cycle. On October29, the hurricane made landfall in Honduras, east of La Ceiba, with winds of 80mph (130km/h). Despite being over land, the NHC continued to predict a turn to the north, which <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> restrengthening.|$|E
5|$|Gore's {{financial}} speculations in {{the late}} 1780s significantly multiplied his wealth. In 1788 he and Andrew Craigie, a Boston businessman who had retained Gore for legal services, entered into a secret agreement to purchase Continental securities with a face value of $100,000 in a speculative bid that their value would rise. By late October of that year, the pair had met this goal: Gore had purchased $90,000 worth of paper for about $20,000, and encouraged Craigie to purchase more than the $11,000 he had acquired if his funding <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> it. Gore also purchased Massachusetts war-related debts, and lobbied Massachusetts Congressmen for the U.S. government to assume those as well.|$|E
5|$|Paleontologists have {{proposed}} {{many ways in}} which the sail could have functioned in life. Some of the first to think about its purpose suggested that the sail may have served as camouflage among reeds while Dimetrodon waited for prey, or as an actual boat-like sail to catch the wind while the animal was in the water. Another is that the long neural spines could have stabilized the trunk by restricting up-and-down movement, which <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> a more efficient side-to-side movement while walking.|$|E

5|$|Sound Transit and the King County Council {{signed a}} new joint-operations {{agreement}} in June 2002, leaving King County Metro as {{owners of the}} tunnel and Sound Transit responsible for paying part of the tunnel's debt service at an estimated cost of $65 million. The agreement <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> buses and light rail trains to share the tunnel and its stations beginning in 2009, after a two-year closure for renovations. A separate agreement signed in May 2003 selected King County Metro as the operator of the light rail line.|$|E
5|$|The Pipeline Authorization Act {{required}} the pipeline {{to be able}} to withstand the maximum earthquake ever recorded in the area it was built. When crossing the Denali Fault, Teflon-coated sliders were designed to allow the pipeline to move side-to-side in an earthquake. To protect against forward-and-backward shocks and to allow for thermal expansion, the pipeline wasn't designed as a straight line. Instead, it was intended to be laid in an S-shape, and the bends <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> expansion and movement without breaking.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Piketty, French {{economist}} {{and author of}} the bestselling book Capital in the Twenty-First Century regards taxes on capital as a more favorable option than austerity (inefficient and unjust) and inflation (only affects cash but neither real estates nor business capital). According to his analysis, a flat tax of 15 percent on private wealth would provide the state with nearly a year's worth national income, which <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> immediate reimbursement of the entire public debt.|$|E
