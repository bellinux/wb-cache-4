5|$|After version 1.0 {{had been}} finished, the engine's code name White Engine {{was changed to}} the {{official}} title Crystal Tools. This was not only done to represent {{the company and its}} <b>works</b> <b>better,</b> but also due to the refractive effects of real-life crystals that were meant to symbolize the flexibility of the engine. Over the next few months, the programmers advanced the engine to version 1.1 and added preliminary support for the Wii. In September 2011, Final Fantasy Versus XIII director Tetsuya Nomura announced that his team had replaced Crystal Tools with a proprietary action game engine that was supplemented by the lighting technology of the company's new Luminous Studio engine. Other teams, such as the staff behind Final Fantasy XIII-2, kept using and refining Crystal Tools. For , the engine was adjusted to make it more suitable to games with an open world design.|$|E
5|$|These {{scattering}} methods generally use monochromatic X-rays, {{which are}} restricted to a single wavelength with minor deviations. A broad spectrum of X-rays (that is, a blend of X-rays with different wavelengths) {{can also be used}} to carry out X-ray diffraction, a technique known as the Laue method. This is the method used in the original discovery of X-ray diffraction. Laue scattering provides much structural information with only a short exposure to the X-ray beam, and is therefore used in structural studies of very rapid events (Time resolved crystallography). However, it is not as well-suited as monochromatic scattering for determining the full atomic structure of a crystal and therefore <b>works</b> <b>better</b> with crystals with relatively simple atomic arrangements.|$|E

Direct imaging can be used to accurately measure the planet's orbit around the star. Unlike the majority of other methods, direct imaging <b>works</b> <b>better</b> with planets with face-on orbits rather than edge-on orbits, as a planet in a face-on orbit is observable during the entirety of the planet's orbit, while planets with edge-on orbits are most easily observable during their period of largest apparent separation from the parent star.|$|E

Due to the extreme efforts needed to achieve improvements during synkinesis, Nakamura et al. observed that patients will often fail to reach their desired goal {{because of the difficulty}} of maintaining motivation during training. The desired course of action is to catch the patient shortly after facial nerve trauma and teach the patient biofeedback techniques. This course of action has been experimentally proven to significantly reduce the development of synkinesis.|$|E

25|$|TNF is {{a protein}} that is {{released}} by activated white blood cells, triggering more inflammation, an immune system response and {{more damage to}} the mucosa of the colon because of the immune activation. Certain drugs inhibit TNF, hence reducing inflammation and immune system involvement. Infliximab {{was approved by the}} FDA for treating ulcerative colitis in March 2005. It is usually given as an intravenous infusions at weeks 0,2 and 6 and then every eight weeks thereafter. It is very useful for inducing and maintaining a remission of ulcerative colitis. Infliximab <b>works</b> <b>better</b> when used in combination with immunmodulators such as 6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine, but a corresponding increase in adverse events means that the decision to use one drug or two must be based on an individualized discussion between the patient and their doctor.|$|E

Author Lucille deView was more critical of book. Writing for The Christian Science Monitor, she complained that The Marriages is not as romantic a novel as it could have been. She said that {{the fate of the}} book's mismatched lovers did not interest her, and felt that their love came across as forced instead of passionate. What could have been an emotionally charged romance became [...] "a calculated intellectual game". deView also criticised Lessing's characters, saying that they [...] "have the familiarity of childhood fairy tales with a little Walt Disney thrown in".|$|E
