5|$|Players {{navigate}} the knight {{to collide with}} enemies. The elevation of an enemy {{in relation to the}} player's knight determines the outcome of the collision. If the protagonist is higher than the enemy, the villain is defeated and vice versa. A collision of equal elevations results in the two knights bouncing off each other. A defeated enemy <b>will</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> an egg that falls toward the bottom of the screen, which a player can collect for points. An egg that sits on a platform long enough will hatch into a new knight; if the player does not pick him up, he will gain a new mount and must be defeated again.|$|E

500|$|Unlike other ancient Chinese works, whose allegories {{were usually}} based on {{historical}} legends and proverbs, most Zhuangzi stories {{seem to have}} been invented by Zhuangzi himself. [...] Some are completely whimsical, such as the strange description of evolution from [...] "misty spray" [...] through a series of substances and insects to horses and humans (chapter 18), while a few other passages seem to be [...] "sheer playful nonsense" [...] which read like Lewis Carroll's [...] "Jabberwocky". The Zhuangzi is full of quirky and fantastic characters, such as [...] "Mad Stammerer", [...] "Fancypants Scholar", [...] "Sir Plow", and a man who believes his left arm <b>will</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> a rooster, his right arm <b>will</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> a crossbow, and his buttocks will become cartwheels.|$|E
500|$|In 1962, {{the book}} was {{published}} in Britain. Siriol Hugh-Jones wrote for The Times Literary Supplement, [...] "The Phantom Tollbooth is something every adult seems sure <b>will</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> a modern Alice... The obvious {{guess is that the}} appeal of this sort of writing is directed towards just the sort of adults who derive a perfectly grown-up pleasure from regularly rereading the Alices. As one might expect, it is illustrated by every grown-up's favourite child-like pictures with the built-in sad sophistication, the work of Jules Feiffer." [...] Jennifer Bourdillon reviewed it for The Listener, [...] "This is the story of an imaginary journey, a sort of Pilgrim's Progress of a little boy in his car... One would hardly have thought from the sound of this that it would have so magnetic an appeal, but the brilliant verbal humour and the weird and wonderful characters (the Dodecahedron. the Watchdog, Faintly Macabre) make it that rare delight, a book which parents and children can share." [...] It reached Australia in 1963; The Canberra Times reviewer, J.E.B., deemed it memorable, causing readers to quote from it and leaf through its pages again.|$|E

Similar to the Achtung Baby sessions, Eno worked two-week shifts. The group often gave him in-progress songs to adjust {{and to which}} he could add his own personality. Initially, the band {{did not have a}} clear plan for how they would release the material being written. At the time, Clayton said, [...] "I don't know if what we're doing here is the next U2 album or a bunch of rough sketches that in two years <b>will</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> the demos for the next U2 album." [...] The Edge was a proponent of making an EP of new material to promote the upcoming leg of the tour, describing his mentality as thus: [...] "We've got a bit of time off. We've got some ideas hanging around from the last record, let's do an EP, maybe four new songs to spice the next phase of the tour up a bit. It'll be a fan thing. It'll be cool." ...|$|E
500|$|There was a Ceklin zduhać {{who was so}} {{beaten by}} other zduhaći {{that he had to}} die, and there he was, dying. Various {{remedies}} were brought to him, but he accepted none, because all was in vain. Finally he had everybody ushered out of his house, except for one of his brothers, a famous hero; all were also driven away from the door, to prevent eavesdropping. Then the dying man said to his brother: [...] "I will surely die, if I am not substituted for; and you can do it and save me, if you will have enough strength." [...] The brother, of course, promised that, and the sick man continued: [...] "You will have to go tonight to Mount So-and-so, at three to four hours' walking distance from here, most of the way lying through a dense forest. You will come beneath a stair-like cliff and stop there, and a great fear will seize you. To encourage yourself, take your two pistols and a knife with the silver sheath." [...] "I will also take a musket," [...] added the brother, and the sick man said, [...] "You may take that too, though only as an encouragement, as it will be of no use to you, but you must have the knife." [...] "I can go without any weapon, with a pocket knife, if it is against a single, and with a weapon I can go against a hundred," [...] interrupted the brother again. [...] "Take it easy with your boldness," [...] resumed the sick man, [...] "and by all means take the knife. When you come beneath the cliff, the sky will be cloudless, lit, {{and there will be a}} silence in the air; then you will notice a wisp of cloud coming from the direction of Mount Rumija, and the wind will start to blow. The wisp <b>will</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> an enormous storm cloud that will cover all the sky, and there will come a darkness such as you have never seen before; the wind will blow, whistle, roar, and shriek, as you have also never heard before; the hair will rise on your head so that it will lift your cap, and I fear that you may go mad from horror. And if you persevere, you will see three bulls falling down from the cloud on the earth: a light-haired, a pied, and a dark-haired bull. The latter two will start to beat the former, which is the weakest, because it is already wounded. Make sure to strike the two bulls with the knife; but take care not to cut the light-haired bull; that would be the death of me, as it would be if the two bulls overcame the light-haired bull." ...|$|E
