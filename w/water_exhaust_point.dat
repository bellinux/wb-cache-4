Considering the thermal conductivities of the material, space under the roof coverage will intent to occur thermal discomfort due to Malaysian ambient temperature. The roof plays an important role to ensure the house is in a state insulated from the hot sun and rain where the zinc roofing will radiated by the sun in noon and yet become the heat source for in-house area. Thermal discomfort will result due to zinc highly heat absorbing material property. The space under the covering will experience significant temperature increase proportional to the amount of supplied heat from sunlight radiated to the zinc roof, and will further be aggravated if ventilation is poor. The {{purpose of this study is}} to compare the temperature distribution by two alternatives methods to reduce the temperature inside a zinc-covered house. The main concept of this cooling system is by splashing water throughout the area of the zinc roofing, where heat exchange process will occur upon contact. The process will dissipate heat from the zinc and will increase the water temperature. This research is focusing on the medium (water) re-cooling process by either open <b>water</b> <b>exhausted</b> or radiator system to state that which one will give better heat exchange.

Based on the example of an LNG installation, the potentials of weld overlaying in anti-corrosive protection of parts operating in LNG installations have been described. The weld overlaying technique enables building up of protective coatings, which not only protect material from corrosion resulting from the flow of more or less aggressive medium (e. g. <b>water,</b> <b>exhaust</b> gas) but also increase the performance life of thus “coated” elements due to the improved abrasion wear resistance of weld overlays. The weld overlaying process is equally well suitable in building of new structures as in the repair of damaged or worn out elements of water or power feeding installations...|$|R
40|$|The {{exhaust gas}} plume is an {{important}} and sometimes dominating contributor to the infrared signature of ships. Suppression of the infrared ship signatures has been studied by TNO for the Royal Netherlands Navy over considerable time. This study deals with the suppression effects, which can be achieved using a spray of cold water in the inner parts of the exhaust system. The effects are compared with the effect of cooling with air. A typical frigate size diesel engine serves as an example for gas flow, composition and temperature of the plume. The infrared emission of the cooled an un-cooled exhaust gases is calculated. Both the spectral behaviour and the integrated values over typical bands are discussed. Apart from the signature also some advantages of <b>water</b> <b>exhaust</b> gas cooling for the ship design are discussed...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the predictions obtained using a recently developed ventilation parameter (VP) {{for evaluating the}} ventilation performance which combines the indices for indoor air quality and thermal comfort. This ventilation parameter is used to analyse the changes in ventilation performance with changes {{in the position of}} workstation in a room ventilated using mixing ventilation. Measurements and CFD simulations for different workstation positions have been carried out at different air change rates. The four indices: the removal effectiveness of contaminant and heat, the predicted percentage of dissatisfied for thermal comfort (PPD) and the percentage of dissatisfied (PD) for air quality were obtained and then used to calculate the value of the ventilation parameter (VP). The results show that VP is a comprehensive index for assessing the changes in ventilation performance due to variations of workstation position.
