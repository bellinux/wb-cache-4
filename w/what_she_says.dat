5|$|In her {{arguments}} for republican virtue, Wollstonecraft invokes an emerging middle-class ethos {{in opposition to}} what she views as the vice-ridden aristocratic code of manners. Influenced by Enlightenment thinkers, she believed in progress and derides Burke for relying on tradition and custom. She argues for rationality, pointing out that Burke's system {{would lead to the}} continuation of slavery, simply because it had been an ancestral tradition. She describes an idyllic country life in which each family can have a farm that will just suit its needs. Wollstonecraft contrasts her utopian picture of society, drawn with <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>says</b> is genuine feeling, to Burke's false feeling.|$|E
5|$|Saori, nicknamed , is a {{girl who}} is a fifth grader in Shuichi's class at the {{beginning}} of Wandering Son. She takes an interest in encouraging Shuichi to cross-dress, even {{going so far as to}} buy Shuichi an expensive dress for Shuichi's birthday, which Shuichi later returns, much to her displeasure. Saori finds it difficult to associate with others; she has few friends, though becomes close to Shuichi. She tends to convey what is on her mind and disregards how others may take <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>says.</b> As Saori grows up, she gradually becomes more standoffish and stoic; she even has bad relations with her teachers. Despite her self-centered attitude, she remains popular among her male classmates due to her physical attractiveness. She is a sensitive girl whose temper sometimes gets the better of her when reprimanding bullies that tease Shuichi, because of Shuichi's femininity and cross-dressing. Saori is often emotionally affected by circumstances involving Shuichi, because of her feelings for Shuichi. Saori converts to Christianity partly because of this influence to seek forgiveness for her previous actions, though she only attends mass when feeling guilty about her behavior.|$|E
25|$|Episkoposes are the Overseers of sects of Discordianism, {{who have}} presumably {{created their own}} sect of Discordianism. They speak to Eris {{through the use of}} their pineal gland. It is said in the Principia Discordia that Eris says {{different}} things to each listener. She may even say radically different things to each Episkopos but, all of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>says</b> is equally her word (even if it contradicts another iteration of her word).|$|E

500|$|One {{explanation}} for this continuing popularity is that the Hardy Boys are simple wish fulfillment. Their adventures allow readers to vicariously experience {{an escape from the}} mundane. At the same time, Frank and Joe live ordinary lives when not solving mysteries, allowing readers to identify with characters who seem realistic and whose parents and authority figures are unfailingly supportive and loving. The Hardy Boys also embody an ideal of masculinity: by their very name they [...] "set the stage for a gentrified version of hardiness and constructed hardiness as an ideal for modern American males", part of the [...] "cultural production of self-control and mastery as the revered ideal for the American man." [...] More controversially, to Meredith Wood, the characters embody not just an ideal of masculinity, but an ideal of white masculinity. She tries to argue that [...] "racist stereotypes are ... fundamental {{to the success of the}} Hardy Boys series." [...] In support of this claim, Wood cites <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>says</b> is the replacement of one stereotype (evil Chinese) with another (evil Latin Americans) in the original and revised versions of Footprints Under the Window. She further claims that this is the reason for the popularity of the Applewood Books reprints of the original, unrevised texts rather that the widely cited blandness of the rewrites.|$|E
2500|$|Here Petruchio is {{specifically}} attacking the very function of Katherina's language, vowing {{that no matter}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>says,</b> he will purposely misinterpret it, thus undermining {{the basis of the}} linguistic sign, and disrupting the relationship between signifier and signified. In this sense, Margaret Jane Kidnie argues this scene demonstrates the [...] "slipperiness of language." ...|$|E

McLeroy was known for sowing doubt about the theory of evolution—until he was ousted in 2010 by Thomas Ratliff. McLeroy said: [...] "I think she'll be a great asset. She testified {{all the time when}} I was on the board." [...] Regardless, McLeroy urges Bruner to be [...] "circumspect" [...] in <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>says</b> and writes. [...] "Back when I was on the board there were no tweets by Don McLeroy... There's so much more that you can find about people today than there was back then." ...|$|E
2500|$|With a {{cool and}} {{collected}} manner {{she does not}} suffer fools gladly. Arfwedson attributes a [...] "no filter" [...] complex - she does not think about <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>says</b> or how other perceive her. In turn this paints her as unfeeling, [...] "very matter of fact" [...] and obsessive about work. She appears almost [...] "robotic" [...] {{but that is a}} facade to conceal personal issues. The actress concluded that [...] "I think she has little social awareness and avoids building relationships due to her past experiences." [...] When she debuts on the wards of Holby City, Zosia wants everyone to know how [...] "brilliant" [...] she is.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{the film}} and the play take {{dramatic}} license with the on-air and behind-the-scene details of The Nixon Interviews. [...] Jonathan Aitken, one of Nixon's official biographers who spent much time with the former president at La Casa Pacifica, rebukes the film for its portrayal of a drunken Nixon making a late-night phone call as never having happened and says it is [...] "from start to finish, an artistic invention by the scriptwriter Peter Morgan." [...] Director Ron Howard discussed the scene in detail on his feature commentary for the DVD release, pointing out it was a deliberate act of dramatic license, and while Frost never received such a phone call, [...] "it was known that Richard Nixon, during ...the Watergate scandal, had occasionally made midnight phone calls that he couldn't very well recall the following day." [...] Aitken recalls that [...] "Frost did not ambush Nixon during the final interview into a damaging admission of guilt. What the former president 'confessed' about Watergate was carefully pre-planned. It was only with considerable help and advice from his adversary's team that Frost managed to get much more out of Nixon, in the closing sequences, by reining in his fierce attitude and adopting a gentler approach." [...] Elizabeth Drew of the Huffington Post and author of Richard M. Nixon (2007) noted some inaccuracies, including a misrepresentation {{of the end of}} the interviews, the failure to mention the fact that Nixon received 20% of the profits from the interviews, and <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>says</b> are inaccurate representations of some of the characters. Drew points out a critical line in the movie that is particularly deceptive: Nixon admitted he [...] "'...was involved in a 'cover-up,' as you call it.' The ellipsis is of course unknown to the audience, and is crucial: What Nixon actually said was, 'You're wanting me to say that I participated in an illegal cover-up. No!'" ...|$|E
