5|$|Skorokhod {{function}} {{spaces are}} frequently {{used in the}} theory of stochastic processes because it often assumed that the sample functions of continuous-time stochastic processes belong to a Skorokhod space. Such spaces contain continuous functions, which correspond to sample functions of the <b>Wiener</b> <b>process.</b> But the space also has functions with discontinuities, which means that the sample functions of stochastic processes with jumps, such as the Poisson process (on the real line), are also members of this space.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Wiener</b> <b>process</b> can be {{constructed}} as the scaling limit of a random walk, or other discrete-time stochastic processes with stationary independent increments. This is known as Donsker's theorem. Like the random walk, the <b>Wiener</b> <b>process</b> is recurrent {{in one or two}} dimensions (meaning that it returns almost surely to any fixed neighborhood of the origin infinitely often) whereas it is not recurrent in dimensions three and higher. Unlike the random walk, it is scale invariant.|$|E

25|$|Wiener took a great {{interest}} in the mathematical theory of Brownian motion (named after Robert Brown) proving many results now widely known such as the non-differentiability of the paths. Consequently, the one-dimensional version of Brownian motion was named the <b>Wiener</b> <b>process.</b> It is the best known of the Lévy processes, càdlàg stochastic processes with stationary statistically independent increments, and occurs frequently in pure and applied mathematics, physics and economics (e.g. on the stock-market).|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} {{standard}} probability spaces {{was started by}} von Neumann in 1932 and shaped by Vladimir Rokhlin in 1940. Rokhlin showed that the unit interval endowed with the Lebesgue measure has important advantages over general probability spaces, yet can be effectively substituted {{for many of these}} in probability theory. The dimension of the unit interval is not an obstacle, as was clear already to Norbert Wiener. He constructed the <b>Wiener</b> <b>process</b> (also called Brownian motion) {{in the form of a}} measurable map from the unit interval to the space of continuous functions.|$|E
30|$|If, after further investigation, we {{find that}} <b>Wiener</b> <b>processes</b> are not satisfactory, we might {{consider}} Lévy jump processes (see, e.g., [19]) because these processes are designed to model larger external shocks than <b>Wiener</b> <b>processes.</b> The model we have considered in this paper does not include deterministic changes in glucose levels resulting from eating a meal or exercise or from a large injection of insulin. Inclusion of these changes should greatly improve future models.|$|R

500|$|The [...] <b>Wiener</b> <b>process</b> is a {{stochastic}} process with stationary and independent increments that are normally distributed {{based on the}} size of the increments. The <b>Wiener</b> <b>process</b> is named after Norbert Wiener, who proved its mathematical existence, but the process is also called the Brownian motion process or just Brownian motion due to its historical connection as a model for Brownian movement in liquids.|$|E
500|$|Almost surely, {{a sample}} {{path of a}} <b>Wiener</b> <b>process</b> is {{continuous}} everywhere but nowhere differentiable.

[...] The process arises as the mathematical limit of other stochastic processes such as certain random walks rescaled, which is the subject of Donsker's theorem or invariance principle, also known as the functional central limit theorem.|$|E
500|$|A {{symmetric}} {{random walk}} and a <b>Wiener</b> <b>process</b> (with zero drift) are both examples of martingales, respectively, in [...] discrete and continuous time. For {{a sequence of}} independent and identically distributed random variables [...] with zero mean, the stochastic process formed from the successive partial sums [...] is a discrete-time martingale. In this aspect, discrete-time martingales generalize the idea of partial sums of independent random variables.|$|E

500|$|A Lévy {{process can}} be defined such that its state space is some {{abstract}} mathematical space, such as a Banach space, but the processes in general are often defined so that they take values in Euclidean space. The index set is the non-negative numbers, so , which gives the interpretation of time. [...] Important stochastic processes such as the <b>Wiener</b> <b>process,</b> the homogeneous Poisson process (in one dimension), and subordinators are all Lévy processes.|$|E
500|$|The <b>Wiener</b> <b>process</b> is {{a member}} of some {{important}} families of stochastic processes, including Markov processes, Lévy processes and Gaussian processes. The process also has many applications and is the main stochastic process used in stochastic calculus. It plays a central role in quantitative finance, where it is used, for example, in the Black–Scholes–Merton model. The process is also used [...] in different fields, including the majority of natural sciences as well as some branches of social sciences, as a mathematical model for various random phenomena.|$|E
500|$|Applications and {{the study}} of {{phenomena}} have in turn inspired the proposal of new stochastic processes. Examples of such stochastic processes include the <b>Wiener</b> <b>process</b> or Brownian motion process, used by Louis Bachelier to study price changes on the Paris Bourse, and the Poisson process, used by A. K. Erlang to study the number of phone calls occurring in a certain period of time. These two stochastic processes are considered the most important and central [...] in the theory of stochastic processes, and were discovered repeatedly and independently, both before and after Bachelier and Erlang, [...] in different settings and countries.|$|E

500|$|Random walks are {{stochastic}} {{processes that}} are usually defined [...] as sums of iid random variables or random vectors in Euclidean space, so they are processes that change in discrete time.

There are other various types of random walks, defined so their state spaces can be other mathematical objects, such as lattices and groups, and in general they are highly studied and have many applications in different disciplines.|$|E
500|$|The <b>Wiener</b> <b>process</b> or Brownian motion {{process has}} {{its origins in}} {{different}} fields including statistics, finance and physics.

The work is now considered as an early discovery of the statistical method known as Kalman filtering, but the work was largely overlooked.

In a 1932 paper Kolmogorov derived a characteristic function for random variables associated with Lévy processes. This result was later derived under more general conditions by Lévy in 1934, and then [...] Khinchin independently gave an alternative form for this characteristic function in 1937.
