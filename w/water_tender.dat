This could be used to fill a portable dump tank not immediately adjacent to the <b>water</b> <b>tender,</b> from which another fire engine can draft. Since water movement during dumping relies on gravity, rather than mechanical pressurization, hard suction hose is useful for this task.|$|E

50|$|Three Garratt {{locomotive}} {{classes were}} designed as tank-and-tender Garratts and rarely worked without auxiliary <b>water</b> <b>tenders.</b> The Type X-17 <b>water</b> <b>tenders</b> were originally numbered for these engines {{in the number}} ranges as shown.|$|R
50|$|Type X-17 <b>water</b> <b>tenders</b> {{first entered}} service in 1938, as {{auxiliary}} <b>water</b> <b>tenders</b> to the Class GM 4-8-2+2-8-4 Double Mountain type Garratt steam locomotives which entered {{service on the}} South African Railways in that year.|$|R
25|$|A tanker truck, {{which can}} also {{be known as a}} <b>water</b> <b>tender</b> or water bowser, is a {{specialist}} fire appliance with the primary purpose of transporting large amounts of water to the fire area to make it available for extinguishing operations. These are especially useful in rural areas where fire hydrants are not readily available and natural water resources are insufficient or difficult to exploit.|$|E
25|$|Freight trains use the {{existing}} loop to allow passenger trains to pass {{them on the}} main line. Steam locomotives on special charters that are not stopping in the station also use the loop as a water stop because nearby road access can allow a <b>water</b> <b>tender</b> to reach the line. It also prevents such trains from blocking the main line or a platform at Newbury. All continuing trains using the loop at the racecourse must also travel through the loop on the down platform at Newbury to rejoin the main line.|$|E
25|$|The Alderney Voluntary Fire Brigade has {{a crew of}} 10 {{volunteer}} firefighters, and a {{fleet of}} One Iveco Daily Light <b>Water</b> <b>Tender</b> (Carry's 10.5M ladder), Two Iveco Water Carriers both carry up to 4,500 litres of water each. One Ford Ranger Rapid Response Unit and Two Trailer Units. A new station was officially opened by Lt.-General Sir John Foley, the Lieutenant Governor of Guernsey, on 20 October 2004. Located near Braye Harbour, it gives an average response time of just 9 minutes and includes four appliance bays, a workshop, kit room, mess and a training room. The Alderney Airport Fire and Rescue Service is sometimes called to help with larger conflagrations.|$|E
50|$|Photographs {{from the}} 1940s show the {{original}} <b>water</b> <b>tenders</b> {{with a traditional}} high turret. The <b>water</b> <b>tenders</b> of 1938 had a water capacity of 6750 imp gal and rode on diamond-frame bogies (similar to North American Archbar trucks) with elliptical springs.|$|R
5000|$|When the SAR {{adopted a}} {{computerised}} goods wagon numbering system, the surviving Type X-17 <b>water</b> <b>tenders</b> were allocated {{numbers in the}} range from 30 019 052 to 30 019 125 (short numbers 1905 to 1912) in respect of the 1938 models and in the number range from 30 019 214 to 30 019 672 (short numbers 1921 to 1967) in respect of the 1953 models. <b>Water</b> <b>tenders</b> bearing [...] "X-17" [...] markings have, however, been photographed bearing numbers in the 30 025 xxx number range of the Type X-20 <b>water</b> <b>tenders.</b>|$|R
50|$|Their Type X-17 <b>water</b> <b>tenders</b> had a 6750 imp gal capacity. In {{spite of}} initial criticisms and doubts, the unusual {{arrangement}} of <b>water</b> <b>tenders</b> which had earlier only been {{seen on the}} Kitson-Meyer locomotives of the Cape Government Railways and Central South African Railways in 1903 and 1904, proved to be very effective and was later repeated upon {{the introduction of the}} Classes GMA and GO Garratts. Photographs from the 1940s show the original <b>water</b> <b>tenders</b> with a traditional high turret, later modified to a low flat-topped turret with a hinged hatch and a curved handrail across the tank barrel.|$|R
25|$|South West Water {{supply the}} town with water and sewage services. South Hams District Council is {{responsible}} for waste management. The town's Distribution Network Operator is Western Power Distribution. Currently the town {{along with the rest}} of Devon relies on electricity generated further north from the national grid, although Langage Power Station in Plympton is now generating. The town has two health centres: Ivybridge Health Centre and Highlands Health Centre, both located near the centre of the town. It also has four dentist surgeries: Victoria House Dental Surgery, Fore Street Dental Practice, M L Brown and Highland Dental Practice. Ivybridge is served by Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust and the nearest hospital is Derriford Hospital in Plymouth. South Western Ambulance Service NHS Trust operates in Ivybridge and the rest of the south west; its headquarters are in Exeter. Devon and Cornwall Constabulary serve the town's policing matters and there is a small police station in the centre of the town. Ivybridge has one retained fire station (number 53) on the southern outskirts of town, which is in the west division of Devon as part of Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service. It has a <b>water</b> <b>tender</b> ladder, prime mover, environmental pod and an incident support unit. The fire station used to be closer to the centre of the town.|$|E

5000|$|These {{appliances}} are broadly {{similar to}} the <b>water</b> <b>tender</b> ladders, but carry a different range of equipment, with ladders up to 10.5 m. They are not the primary responder to a road traffic collision - despite carrying hydaulic cutting equipment, the equipment is not as robust or effective as of that carried on a <b>Water</b> <b>Tender</b> Ladder. The water tenders are used to support <b>water</b> <b>tender</b> ladders at property fires and to attend miscellaneous calls.

50|$|This {{class of}} {{apparatus}} {{does not necessarily}} have enough pumping capacity to power large hose lines (like a fire engine), though it utilizes a smaller pump to draft from bodies of <b>water.</b> <b>Water</b> <b>tenders</b> are used {{when there is no}} working fire hydrant within reach of other fire equipment, potentially supplying the fire engine(s) with a very rapid connection. Most <b>water</b> <b>tenders</b> are designed to carry loads of 1000 gallons (approx. 3800 litres) or more. In the US, 1000 gallons is the requirement in the NFPA standards. Some may carry up to or even upwards of 5000 gallons (approx. 19,000 litres) of water - even more with a trailer.|$|R
