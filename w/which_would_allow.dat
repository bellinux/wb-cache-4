5|$|In August 2016, it was {{reported}} that the MTA was looking into an extension of the IRT Nostrand Avenue Line along Flatbush Avenue to Marine Park, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> trains to serve Kings Plaza. Both the Utica Avenue and Nostrand Avenue proposals for extensions to Kings Plaza have been proposed since the 1910s.|$|E
5|$|A Second Avenue trunk line, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> have <b>allowed</b> 34 more {{trains to}} midtown per hour.|$|R

5|$|Smallpeice would, whilst {{working at}} Doulton's, involve himself {{further in the}} ICAEW, {{promoting}} rule changes <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> chartered accountants working in industry {{to sit on the}} ICAEW council, and being eligible to be Fellows of the Institute. This would lead to him serving on the ICAEW council from 1948 to 1957.|$|E
5|$|Train {{frequencies}} {{are primarily}} {{limited by the}} fact that most lines funnel into the Transbay Tube and San Francisco. While a small sections of track in Oakland, Colma, and Daly City are triple- and quadruple-tracked, there are few sidings <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> limited-stop or express trains to pass others.|$|E
5|$|Written by Gareth Roberts. A story idea {{considered}} for the fourth series. During a school trip, the youngsters find an alien in distress and have to help it without revealing its presence {{to the rest of}} their friends. This notion was conceived as a 'Sarah Jane-lite' narrative <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> Elisabeth Sladen a break in production.|$|E
50|$|PNC later {{published}} a list stating <b>which</b> events <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> tailgating; shows drawing a younger audience {{would have no}} tailgating while shows such as Kenny Chesney <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> it.|$|R

50|$|Nothogomphodon {{was unusual}} among therocephalians for its sectorial dentition, a feature it shared with cynodonts and <b>which</b> <b>would</b> have <b>allowed</b> it to shear meat more effectively.|$|R
5|$|In February 2012, Bell {{applied for}} a patent on an {{invention}} which would improve fibre optic communication speeds and assist in transmitting long distances. Although yet to produce any fibre, Bell states his mathematical models show the velocity of light within the fiber can be improved to from 68% to 98% {{of the speed of}} light with lower optical loss and dispersion <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> light pulses to be transmitted for longer distances without being smeared together over time and distance.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Miller had the {{upcoming}} Test series against England in 1946–47 {{to look forward}} to. He therefore approached his employers for two months leave {{so that he could}} travel to the United States to marry Wagner, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> him time to return in preparation for the international series. Vacuum Oil refused, so, with the comfort of job security in England, Miller resigned.|$|E
5|$|Nawaz Sharif {{resigned}} as Prime Minister on 29 July 2017 and nominated his brother Shehbaz Sharif as his successor, but as Shehbaz {{was not a}} member of the National Assembly, he could not be immediately sworn in as Prime Minister. Therefore, Abbasi was chosen by Sharif as a temporary Prime Minister for 45 days, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> two months time for Shehbaz to contest elections from Nawaz's vacated constituency in Lahore, be elected to the National Assembly, and become eligible to hold the office of Prime Minister.|$|E
5000|$|The STIB/MIVB {{had plans}} to make lines 1 and 5 fully {{automatic}} by 2016 <b>which</b> <b>would</b> have <b>allowed</b> {{a significant increase in}} the frequency of trains.|$|R

5|$|On August 31, 2014, a {{large number}} of private {{photographs}} taken by celebrities were posted online due to a compromise of user passwords at iCloud. The images were initially posted on 4chan. As a result of the incident, 4chan announced that it would enforce a Digital Millennium Copyright Act policy, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> content owners to remove material that had been shared on the site illegally, and would ban users who repeatedly posted stolen material.|$|E
5|$|Paleontologists have {{proposed}} {{many ways in}} which the sail could have functioned in life. Some of the first to think about its purpose suggested that the sail may have served as camouflage among reeds while Dimetrodon waited for prey, or as an actual boat-like sail to catch the wind while the animal was in the water. Another is that the long neural spines could have stabilized the trunk by restricting up-and-down movement, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> for a more efficient side-to-side movement while walking.|$|E
5|$|Qatar Radio (QR) is {{currently}} an associate {{member of the}} European Broadcasting Union (EBU), while all competing countries of the Eurovision Song Contest must be active members of the Union. The broadcaster first revealed on 12 May 2009 that {{they were interested in}} becoming active members of the Union, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> the nation to compete in the Contest. Qatar Radio has stated that they hope to join Eurovision by 2011.|$|E

50|$|In 2013 Murphy {{voted in}} support of the Northern Route Approval Act, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> have <b>allowed</b> Congress to {{unilaterally}} approve construction of the Keystone Pipeline without the approval of the Obama administration.|$|R
5|$|Some Canadian and British {{infantry}} divisions {{had been}} temporarily equipped with M7 Priest self-propelled guns for the D-Day landings, {{which had been}} replaced by towed 25-Pounder field guns. Simonds had the Priests converted into Kangaroo Armoured Personnel Carriers, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> infantry to follow the tanks closely on any terrain. Permission was first requested from the Americans, from whom the M7s had been borrowed, to convert them into APCs.|$|E
5|$|The {{first three}} lunar {{missions}} (Apollo 8, Apollo 10, and Apollo 11) used a free return trajectory, keeping a flight path coplanar with the lunar orbit, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> {{a return to}} Earth in case the SM engine failed to make lunar orbit insertion. Landing site lighting conditions on later missions dictated a lunar orbital plane change, which required a course change maneuver soon after TLI, and eliminated the free-return option.|$|E
5|$|The {{planners}} then examined {{whether a}} commando force was feasible {{to accomplish the}} task. An unusually high spring tide was due in March 1942 <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> a light ship to pass over the sand banks in the estuary and approach the docks, bypassing the heavily defended dredged channel. The approach was too shallow for an infantry landing ship, but the planners believed if a destroyer could be lightened it might have a draft shallow enough to enable it to get through.|$|E
5000|$|In 2006, Sizemore {{associate}} Russ Walker introduced Measure 41, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> have <b>allowed</b> [...] "income {{tax deduction}} equal to federal exemptions deduction {{to substitute for}} state exemption credit." [...] It failed 73-37.|$|R
50|$|The {{situation}} of the Catholic Church in the Thirteen Colonies was characterized by an extensive religious persecution originating from Protestant sects, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> barely <b>allow</b> religious toleration to Catholics living on American territory.|$|R
50|$|U.S. Representative Steve Cohen (D-TN9) {{introduced}} H.R. 2449 or The Fresh Start Act of 2011 {{during the}} 112th Congress, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> have <b>allowed</b> certain non-violent offenders to seek expungement of otherwise lifelong felonies.|$|R
5|$|Thomas Piketty, French {{economist}} {{and author of}} the bestselling book Capital in the Twenty-First Century regards taxes on capital as a more favorable option than austerity (inefficient and unjust) and inflation (only affects cash but neither real estates nor business capital). According to his analysis, a flat tax of 15 percent on private wealth would provide the state with nearly a year's worth national income, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> for immediate reimbursement of the entire public debt.|$|E
5|$|Vistara uses Club Vistara as its frequent-flyer program; it {{operates}} as a value based program and awards points {{on the basis of}} money spent on tickets rather that miles travelled by passengers. On 29 January 2015, Vistara announced a partnership agreement with Singapore Airlines (SIA) <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> Club Vistara members to earn and redeem miles with the KrisFlyer program on SIA and Silk Air flights and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|Wells, et al., {{alternately}} {{suggested that}} as a terrane at {{the margin of the}} continent was pushed over the Yellowstone hotspot, it was rifted away from the continent by the upwelling magma, which then formed the Siletzia basalts. This idea was further developed by , who suggested rifting might have been initiated by a change in plate direction, or by kinematic effects as the Kula-Farallon ridge migrated along the continental margin. One such effect is the formation of a slab window (or slab gap) <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> increased upwelling of magma.|$|E
50|$|Some {{controversial}} rejections of Israeli nationals include {{tennis player}} Shahar Pe'er who was denied {{a visa to}} the United Arab Emirates <b>which</b> <b>would</b> have <b>allowed</b> her {{to play in the}} 2009 Dubai Open.|$|R
