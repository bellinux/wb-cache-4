40|$|We {{examine how}} {{shareholder}} activist campaigns affect {{the careers of}} directors of the targeted firms. Using a comprehensive sample of shareholder activism between 2004 and 2011, we find that directors are almost twice as likely to leave over a two-year period if the firm {{is the subject of a}} shareholder activist campaign. While it has been argued that proxy contests are an ineffective mechanism <b>for</b> <b>replacing</b> directors, as <b>they</b> rarely succeed in getting a majority of shareholder support, our results suggest that director turnover takes place following shareholder activism even without shareholder activists engaging in, let alone winning, proxy contests. Performance-sensitivity of director turnover is also higher in the presence of shareholder activism. We also find that director election results matter for director retention: directors are more likely to leave in the year following activism when they receive lower shareholder support. Contrary to consequences on the targeted firm’s board, we find no evidence that directors lose seats on other boards, a proxy for reputational consequences, as a result of shareholder activism...|$|R

A new painting in the gallery is a lost Van Gogh, which Artie thinks is an artifact because [...] "death follows it." [...] Later that night, Jinks and Artie break into the gallery, only to find Stukowski waiting <b>for</b> them. <b>They</b> <b>replace</b> the Van Gogh with one they have copied, then discover the painting is activated by a puff of air after Stukowski sneezes on it and she and Jinks are thrown across the room by a violent wind. The device used to disable the alarm fails, sounding the alarm. Stukowski escapes with the original Van Gogh before the doors shut, leaving Artie and Jinks to be arrested by the police.|$|R
40|$|Erotism plunges human into loneliness” – {{this is an}} {{argument}} put by Georges Bataille in his book Erotism. Isolation resulting from deceptive carnality accompanies heroes of Michel Houellebecq novels as well. This state leads them to feeling of emptiness and emotional burnout. One of the reasons of this state lies in learned carnality. In Bataille’s conception those modeled behaviour can be refered to {{things that are not}} allowed, tabooised and relegated to intimate space. Problems that tire Houellebecq’s heroes end with compulsive behaviours performed by them. Those acts exceed social rules, deepen feeling of alienation and rejection. Men of Houellebecq world can’t name their needs and there <b>for</b> <b>they</b> <b>replace</b> them with needs that are created by consumer society. Fulfillment of those superficial desires unfortunetly doesn’t resolve the problem of isolation, it lingers them into desire that brings with itself repulsion and feelings of guilt...|$|R

His Vice President, John Nance Garner, along with Postmaster General James Farley, {{announced}} their candidacies for the Democratic nomination. When the convention came, Roosevelt sent a message to the convention, saying he would run only if drafted, saying delegates were free to vote for whomever they pleased. The delegates issued 946 votes for Roosevelt, 72 for Farley, and 61 <b>for</b> Garner; <b>they</b> <b>replaced</b> Garner with Henry A.

In the 1940 general election, while Republican Wendell Willkie received six million more votes than the previous Republican candidate (Alfred Landon) had in 1936, Roosevelt still won decisively, taking 38 of 48 states. [...] His supporters cited impending war as a reason for breaking with precedent, while Willkie had run against the principle of a third term. Roosevelt was the first president elected to a third term, and remains the only one to exceed eight years in office.|$|R
