5|$|Bach used {{a rather}} unusual melody by Caspar von Stieler, whereas he based his later chorale cantata on this hymn on the melody by Jacob Regnart. The hymn {{is treated as}} in a chorale fantasia, <b>with</b> <b>string</b> ritornellos between the verses.|$|E
5|$|Since joining Sega Digital Studio in 2006, Eguchi has {{switched}} over {{to almost}} an exclusively orchestral style. On recent projects, he has assisted his fellow co-workers <b>with</b> <b>string</b> and keyboard arrangements, {{in addition to}} writing his own material.|$|E
5|$|Nash's father, who had {{initially}} {{worked as a}} gas stoker, joined the police force in 1913 and served {{in a number of}} postings, including Hamilton in western Victoria, taking his family with him. In Hamilton, Nash attended Loreto Convent and began his interest in sport, practising kicking a football made of newspapers and tied together <b>with</b> <b>string.</b>|$|E

5|$|One of the {{important}} developments following Witten's announcement was Witten's work in 1996 <b>with</b> <b>string</b> theorist Petr Hořava. Witten and Hořava studied M-theory on a special spacetime geometry with two ten-dimensional boundary components. Their work {{shed light on the}} mathematical structure of M-theory and suggested possible ways of connecting M-theory to real world physics.|$|E
5|$|Constructed by the Ruthvens {{after they}} {{acquired}} the castle around 1515, the Ruthven Lodging represents {{the final stage}} of building at Dirleton. In the later part of the 16th century, it served as the main residence of Lady Dorothea, wife of the first Earl of Gowrie, and their 15 children. The three-storey building is constructed, like the Haliburton range, from undressed stone, although the Ruthven Lodging is decorated <b>with</b> <b>string</b> courses, horizontal mouldings running around the walls. The large windows were protected by iron grilles and small gun holes. The rectangular Lodging is immediately {{to the north of the}} de Vaux building, separated by a narrow irregular courtyard, which is accessed via a passage in the ground floor of the Lodging. The remainder of the ground floor was occupied by cellars, with family rooms and bedrooms on the upper floors. The first-floor dining room was paved with patterned floor tiles, and may once have had a painted timber ceiling.|$|E
5|$|The costumes used in {{the show}} drew {{inspiration}} {{from a number of}} sources, such as Japanese and Persian armour. Dothraki dress resembles that of the Bedouin (one was made out of fish skins to resemble dragon scales), and the Wildlings wear animal skins like the Inuit. Wildling bone armor is made from molds of actual bones, and is assembled <b>with</b> <b>string</b> and latex resembling catgut. Although the extras who play Wildlings and the Night's Watch often wear hats (normal in a cold climate), members of the principal cast usually do not so viewers can distinguish the main characters. Björk's Alexander McQueen high-neckline dresses inspired Margaery Tyrell's funnel-neck outfit, and prostitutes' dresses are designed for easy removal. All clothing used is aged for two weeks so it appears realistic on high-definition television.|$|E

25|$|From {{the late}} 1920s, the {{increased}} practicality of electronic instruments influenced composers such as Joseph Schillinger to adopt them. They were typically used within orchestras, and most composers wrote parts for the theremin that could otherwise be performed <b>with</b> <b>string</b> instruments.|$|E
25|$|Some {{solar cooker}} designs are {{affected}} by strong winds, which can slow the cooking process, cool the food due to convective losses, and disturb the reflector. It {{may be necessary to}} anchor the reflector, such as <b>with</b> <b>string</b> and weighted objects like bricks.|$|E
25|$|It is very {{difficult}} to speak of the voice of Callas. Her voice was a very special instrument. Something happens sometimes <b>with</b> <b>string</b> instruments—violin, viola, cello—where the first moment you listen to the sound of this instrument, the first feeling is a bit strange sometimes. But after just a few minutes, when you get used to, when you become friends with this kind of sound, then the sound becomes a magical quality. This was Callas.|$|E

25|$|Regular series {{composer}} Shirō Sagisu scored The End of Evangelion. The film prominently features {{selections of}} Johann Sebastian Bach's music throughout the movie. Episode 25' has the Japanese title Air, being {{named after the}} Air on the G String which is played during the episode. Among the other pieces included are Cello Suite No. 1 in G Major (I. Prélude), Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring (transcribed for piano and later played again <b>with</b> <b>string</b> instruments in the end credits), and Pachelbel's Canon.|$|E
25|$|Breakaway roping – {{an easier}} form of calf roping where {{a very short}} lariat is used, tied lightly to the saddle horn <b>with</b> <b>string</b> and a flag. When the calf is roped, the horse stops, {{allowing}} the calf to run on, flagging {{the end of time}} when the string and flag breaks from the saddle. In the United States, this event is primarily for women of all ages and boys under 12, while in some nations where traditional calf roping is frowned upon, riders of both genders compete.|$|E
25|$|All told, Brahms {{published}} 24 {{works of}} chamber music, including three string quartets, five piano trios, the quintet for piano and strings, Op. 34, and other works. Among his last works were the clarinet quintet, Op. 115, and a trio for clarinet, cello and piano. He wrote a trio for the unusual combination of piano, violin and horn, Op. 40. He also wrote two songs for alto singer, viola and piano, Op. 91, reviving {{the form of}} voice <b>with</b> <b>string</b> obbligato that had been virtually abandoned since the Baroque.|$|E

25|$|If {{the cost}} of {{comparisons}} exceeds {{the cost of}} swaps, {{as is the case}} for example <b>with</b> <b>string</b> keys stored by reference or with human interaction (such as choosing one of a pair displayed side-by-side), then using binary insertion sort may yield better performance. Binary insertion sort employs a binary search to determine the correct location to insert new elements, and therefore performs ⌈log2(n)⌉ comparisons in the worst case, which is O(n log n). The algorithm as a whole still has a running time of O(n2) on average because of the series of swaps required for each insertion.|$|E
25|$|Strauss's {{output of}} works for solo {{instrument}} or instruments with orchestra was fairly extensive. The most famous include two concertos for horn, {{which are still}} part of the standard repertoire of most horn soloists—Horn concerto No. 1 (1883) and Horn concerto No. 2 (1942); the Romanze for cello and orchestra (1883); a Violin Concerto in D minor (1882); the Burleske for piano and orchestra (1885, revised 1889); the tone poem Don Quixote for cello, viola and orchestra (1897); the well-known late Oboe Concerto in D major (1945); and the Duett-Concertino for clarinet and bassoon <b>with</b> <b>string</b> orchestra, {{which was one of}} his last works (1948).|$|E
25|$|His last commercially {{available}} project, Papa Woody, {{was released in}} 1996 under the name Ether Bunny, although it was basically a solo effort. Serving as his personal tribute to the cartoon and jazz music, Vahnke claims to have been more satisfied with his work on Papa Woody than on any Vampire Rodents album. A collaboration with Athan Maroulis called Alchemia, later renamed Obsidian, was planned for release in 1997 but never came into fruition. The overall project {{was described as a}} SBC and LTG approach to The Blue Nile <b>with</b> <b>string</b> orchestra. Also, a completely instrumental Vampire Rodent album was completed the same year, but like the Alcemia/Obsidian project was shelved indefinitely.|$|E
