5|$|A further {{example of}} an {{executive}} decision invalidated by improper purpose {{can be seen from}} Congreve v. Home Office (1976). In that case, the Home Secretary, who had the power to revoke television licences, purported to revoke the licences of people who had pre-empted a rise in licence fees by buying a licence at the old rate before the date when the fees <b>were</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> go up, even though their old licences had not yet expired. The court held that this was an improper exercise of the Home Secretary's discretionary powers. His power to revoke could not be used to raise revenue, and therefore this power had been used for the wrong purpose.|$|E
5|$|About 80% of Manila's 7 million {{residents}} lost power {{due to the}} storm. Low-lying areas of Manila were underwater as strong winds blew away roofs of shacks and uprooted trees. Throughout the city, four deaths happened. One man was electrocuted while another man was crushed by debris. Fifty people were confirmed to have died and 2,089 dwellings were damaged in nearby Bataan after storm surge crashed into the area. Most of the casualties in Bataan <b>were</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> drownings; the city was also the hardest hit by the storm. Throughout the area near Bataan, 10 villages were destroyed. In Pantalan Luma, all but four of the town's 400 huts were destroyed.|$|E

5|$|After {{they left}} The Simpsons, Oakley and Weinstein created Mission Hill. The show {{was plagued by}} promotional issues and was swiftly canceled.

He has since written for The Cleveland Show and Portlandia, without Weinstein. He also served as co-executive producer and writer on Portlandia, sharing a Writers Guild of America Award with his fellow writers in 2013. Oakley is married to fellow writer Rachel Pulido.|$|E
5|$|Among the downsides {{to rapid}} {{industrialization}} was pollution. Brick firing produced {{particulate air pollution}} and paint-making created lead dust, while beer and liquor brewing produced grain swill. The worst pollution was coal dust and smoke, for which St. Louis was infamous by the 1890s. The greatest number of complaints to the St. Louis Board of Health <b>were</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> industries engaged in rendering, which produced noxious fumes. In spite of this, pollution control was hindered {{by a desire to}} promote growth. One of the few controls began in 1880, in which regulations would be enforced strictly in some areas while little in others, thereby encouraging factories to concentrate in industrial districts.|$|E
