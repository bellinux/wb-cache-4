40|$|An {{analytical}} {{comparison of}} the efficiency of solar thermal collector arrays <b>with</b> and <b>without</b> <b>external</b> manifolds is reported. A FORTRAN computer program was written for the computation of the thermal performance of solar thermal collector arrays <b>with</b> and <b>without</b> <b>external</b> manifolds. Arrays constructed from two example solar thermal collectors are computated. Typical external manifold sizes and thermal insulations are presented graphically and are compared with the thermal performance of the collector alone...|$|R

40|$|Using {{a natural}} {{experiment}} {{designed by the}} Italian national test administrator (INVALSI) to monitor test procedures in Italian primary schools, this paper shows {{that the presence of}} an external examiner who monitors test procedures has both a direct and an indirect effect on the measured performance of monitored classes and schools. The direct effect is the difference in the test performance between classes of the same school <b>with</b> and <b>without</b> <b>external</b> examiners. The indirect effect is instead the difference in performance between un-monitored classes in a school with an external examiner and un-monitored classes in schools <b>without</b> <b>external</b> monitoring. We find that having an external examiner in the class reduces the proportion of correct answers by 5. 5 to 8. 6 percent compared to classes in schools with no external monitor. Comparing results of un-monitored classes across schools <b>with</b> and <b>without</b> <b>external</b> examiners, we estimate indirect effects that range between 1. 2 and 1. 9 percent. The size of the overall effect of external supervision varies significantly across regions and it is higher in Southern Italy...|$|R

Numerical results comparing the pointing accuracy of three-axes stabilized, spinning, and dual-spin satellites are presented here.

40|$|The {{effect of}} thermal cycling on the {{microstructure}} and mechanical {{properties of the}} AA 6061 - 20 % SiCw composite was studied under constant stresses. The microstructural evolution of the composite was analyzed using light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy image analysis, and transmission electron microscopy. The tensile behavior was correlated with the microstructural characteristics of the material.

The present investigation highlights the application of mesoporous SBA- 15 as an excellent support for enhancing the selectivity of γ-valerolactone over Ni/SBA- 15 catalysts. Furthermore, this catalytic system is efficient {{for the production of}} γ-valerolactone with molecular H 2 and <b>without</b> <b>external</b> H 2 source (formic acid as a H 2 source).|$|R

50|$|The same {{principles}} of negative feedback control (including {{the ability to}} nullify effects of unpredictable external or internal disturbances) apply to living control systems. The thesis of PCT is that animals and people do not control their behavior; rather, they vary their behavior as their means for controlling their perceptions, <b>with</b> or <b>without</b> <b>external</b> disturbances. This directly contradicts the historical and still widespread assumption that behavior is the final result of stimulus inputs and cognitive plans.|$|R
40|$|We use {{a natural}} {{experiment}} {{to show that}} the presence of an external examiner has both a direct and an indirect negative effect on the performance of monitored classes in standardised educational tests. The direct effect is the difference in the test performance between classes of the same school <b>with</b> and <b>without</b> <b>external</b> examiners. The indirect effect is the difference in performance between un-monitored classes in schools with an external examiner and un-monitored classes in schools <b>without</b> <b>external</b> monitoring.

A Dispersion Relation Preserving concept has been incorporated into both of the numerical schemes. Two dimensional Euler computation of a spatially-developing free shear flow, <b>with</b> and <b>without</b> <b>external</b> excitation, has been performed to demonstrate the capability of numerical schemes developed.

Two examples involving four-level systems <b>with</b> or <b>without</b> <b>external</b> control fields are investigated. Our results show that non-Markovian master equations are capable of exhibiting quantum interference phenomena in a temporal domain that has not fully explored before. In particular, we show that the environmental memory is instrumental in the onset of non-Markovian quantum interference pattern in different time scales...|$|R

Both stent placement and brachytherapy provide comparable palliation to endoscopic chemical ablative therapy but are preferable because of the reduced requirement for reintervention. Other available modalities, such as laser therapy, photodynamic therapy, or chemical ablation, are not recommended for palliation of dysphagia because of a high incidence of complications and recurrent dysphagia...|$|R

For all dopings we find negative differential conductivity at sufficiently {{high electric}} fields.
