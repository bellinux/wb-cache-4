5|$|Between 1860 and 1865 {{southern}} cotton became unavailable {{during the}} Civil War, Harrisburg {{was one of}} the few cities in the Upland South during this time to have woolen mills, making the town an industrial asset early on to Southern Illinois. Several planing mills and flour mills also dotted the city.

5|$|Several {{women were}} lined up as {{possible}} brides for Albert Victor. The first, in 1889, was his cousin Princess Alix of Hesse and by Rhine, {{but she did not}} return his affections and refused his offer of engagement. She would later marry Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, another of Albert Victor's cousins, in 1894. The second, in 1890, was a love match with Princess Hélène of Orléans, a daughter of Prince Philippe, Count of Paris, a pretender to the French throne <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>living</b> in England after being banished from France in 1886.|$|E

5|$|According to Dickens {{specialist}} Trey Philpotts, {{the newest}} arrival was usually placed with the youngest prisoner <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>living</b> alone. A wealthier prisoner could pay his roommate to go away—"buy out the chum"—for half-a-crown {{a week in}} 1818, while the outcast chum would sleep in the tap room or find another room to rent in the prison. The only prisoners not expected to pay chummage were debtors who had declared themselves insolvent by swearing an oath that they had assets worth less than 40 shillings. If their creditors agreed, they could be released after 14days, but if anyone objected, they remained confined to the poor side of the building, near the women's side, receiving a small weekly allowance from the county and money from charity.|$|E
5|$|After his retirement, San Martín {{intended}} {{to live in}} Cuyo. Although the war of independence had ended in the region, the Argentine Civil Wars continued. The unitarians wanted to organize {{the country as a}} unitary state centered on Buenos Aires, and the federals, who preferred a federation of provinces. San Martín had good relations with the federal caudillos and a personal feud with unitarian leader Bernardino Rivadavia, but tried to stay neutral. San Martín's wife, María de los Remedios de Escalada, died in 1823, so he returned to Buenos Aires. He took his daughter Mercedes Tomasa, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>living</b> with her mother's family, and sailed to Europe.|$|E

He was arrested on 5 May 1950, and held in the notorious Sighet prison (alongside three of his brothers — Ștefan Tătărescu included — and his former collaborator Bejan). His son Tudor, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>living</b> in Paris, suffered from schizophrenia after 1950, {{and had to be}} committed to an institution (where he died in 1955). Sandra Tătărescu Negropontes was also imprisoned in 1950, and released three years later, upon the death of Joseph Stalin.|$|E

5|$|Delaney had {{a lifelong}} history of helping others, and once {{paid for the}} funeral of a former teacher whose family could not afford a proper service. On June 29, 1983, Delaney, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>living</b> in nearby Ruston, went with friends to Critter's Creek, an {{amusement}} center at Chennault Park in Monroe, Louisiana. While reportedly discouraging swimming children from venturing too far out in a pond, Delaney dove in to save three children who were screaming for help, floundering in a water hole left by recent construction work. The water hole, which covered two acres and was six feet deep, was not intended for swimming but {{to add to the}} park's aesthetics. Despite his inability to swim, Delaney nevertheless tried to rescue the children. One child managed {{to get out of the}} water without harm and another was taken to an emergency room where he later died; police recovered the body of Delaney and the remaining child. The amusement park has since been closed to the public.|$|E
5|$|Holloway {{was last}} seen by her classmates around 1:30a.m. on Monday, May 30 as she was leaving the Oranjestad bar and nightclub Carlos'n Charlie's.

Holloway had been scheduled to fly home later that day, but did not appear for her return flight. Her packed luggage and passport were found in her Holiday Inn room. Aruban authorities initiated searches for Holloway throughout the island and surrounding waters, but did not find her.|$|E
5|$|In {{these years}} he {{recovered}} the manuscript {{that he and}} Thomas Young had worked in his youth from Young's widow, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>living</b> in Albany, and began to develop it into the work that was published in 1785 as Reason: the Only Oracle of Man. The work was a typical Allen polemic, but its target was religious, not political. Specifically targeted against Christianity, it was an unbridled attack against the Bible, established churches, and {{the powers of the}} priesthood. As a replacement for organized religion, he espoused a mixture of deism, Spinoza's naturalist views, and precursors of Transcendentalism, with man acting as a free agent within the natural world. While historians disagree over the exact authorship of the work, the writing contains clear indications of Allen's style.|$|E

5|$|Losing the undersheriff {{position}} left Wyatt Earp {{without a}} job in Tombstone; however, Wyatt and his brothers were beginning {{to make some money}} on their mining claims in the Tombstone area. In January 1881, Oriental Saloon owner Mike Joyce gave Wyatt Earp a one-quarter interest in the faro concession at the Oriental Saloon in exchange for his services as a manager and enforcer. Gambling was regarded as a legitimate profession, comparable to a doctor or member of clergy, at the time. Wyatt invited his friend, lawman and gambler Bat Masterson, to Tombstone to help him run the faro tables in the Oriental Saloon. In June 1881, Wyatt also telegraphed another friend and gambler from Dodge, Luke Short, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>living</b> in Leadville, Colorado, and offered him a job as a faro dealer.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Rana Bahadur Shah's youth {{had been}} spent in pampered luxury. In 1794 Rana Bahadur came of age, {{and his first}} act was to re-constitute the government, with his uncle, Bahadur Shah, removed from all {{official}} position. In mid 1795, he became infatuated with a Maithili Brahman widow, Kantavati Jha, and married her on the oath of making their illegitimate half-caste son (as per the Hindu law of that time) the heir apparent, by excluding the legitimate heir from his previous marriage. By 1797, {{his relationship with his}} uncle, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>living</b> a retired life, and who wanted to seek refuge in China on the pretext of meeting the new emperor, had deteriorated {{to the extent that he}} ordered his imprisonment on 19 February 1797 and his subsequent murder on 23 June 1797. Such acts earned Rana Bahadur notoriety both among courtiers and common people, especially among Brahmins.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the classic}} account of slaves that escaped on the Underground Railroad was Harriet Beecher Stowe's fictional work, Uncle Tom's Cabin, which relates the story of Eliza Harris, a young slave girl who escaped the South by {{crossing}} the Ohio River on a winter night. Barefooted and carrying her baby, the fictional Eliza was exhausted and nearly dead when she reached safety. After receiving food, clothing, new shoes, and shelter from Stowe's fictional Quaker couple, Simeon and Rachael Halliday, Eliza continued her journey to freedom in Canada. Stow, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>living</b> in the city at the time, was acquainted with the Coffins, {{who may have been}} the inspiration for the Halliday couple in her novel.|$|E

5|$|The Duchess of York's Catholic secretary, Edward Colman, was, in 1678, falsely {{implicated in}} a fictitious plot against the King by Titus Oates. The plot, {{known as the}} Popish Plot, led to the Exclusionist movement, which was headed by Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury. The Exclusionists sought to debar the Catholic Duke of York from the throne. Their {{reputation}} in tatters, the Yorks were reluctantly exiled to Brussels, a domain of the King of Spain, ostensibly to visit Lady Mary—since 1677 the wife of Prince William III of Orange. Accompanied by her not yet three-year-old daughter Isabella and Lady Anne, the Duchess of York was saddened by James's extra-marital affair with Catherine Sedley. Mary's spirits were briefly revived by a visit from her mother, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>living</b> in Rome.|$|E
5|$|The Hungarian {{physicist}} Leó Szilárd, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>living</b> in the United States at the time, {{realized that}} the neutron-driven fission of heavy atoms {{could be used to}} create a nuclear chain reaction that could yield vast amounts of energy for electric power generation or atomic bombs. Such a reaction using neutrons was an idea he had first formulated in 1933, upon reading Ernest Rutherford's disparaging remarks about generating power from his team's 1932 experiment using protons to split lithium. However, Szilárd {{had not been able to}} achieve a neutron-driven chain reaction with neutron-rich light atoms. In theory, if in a neutron-driven chain reaction the number of secondary neutrons produced was greater than one, then each such reaction could trigger multiple additional reactions, producing an exponentially increasing number of reactions.|$|E
5|$|When Puerto Rico {{experienced}} {{a period of}} severe political repression in 1887 by the Spanish governor of the time, Romualdo Palacio (which led {{to the arrest of}} many local political leaders, including Román Baldorioty de Castro), Máximo Gómez, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>living</b> in Panama at the time (at the time, he supervised a laborers' brigade during the construction of the Panama Canal) offered his services to Betances, sold most of his personal belongings to finance a revolt in Puerto Rico, and volunteered to lead any Puerto Rican troops had such revolt occur. The revolt was deemed unnecessary later in the year, when the Spanish government recalled Palacio from office to investigate charges of abuse of power from his part, but Gómez and Betances established a friendship and logistical relationship that lasted until Betances' death in 1898.|$|E

5|$|Anne was {{recalled}} {{to marry}} her Irish cousin, James Butler, {{a young man who}} was several years older than she and <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>living</b> at the English court, in an attempt to settle a dispute over the title and estates of the Earldom of Ormond. The 7th Earl of Ormond died in 1515, leaving his daughters, Margaret Boleyn and Anne St Leger, as co-heiresses. In Ireland, the great-great-grandson of the 3rd earl, Sir Piers Butler, contested the will and claimed the Earldom himself. He was already in possession of Kilkenny Castle – the ancestral seat of the earls. Sir Thomas Boleyn, being the son of the eldest daughter, felt the title belonged to him and protested to his brother-in-law, the Duke of Norfolk, who spoke to King Henry about the matter. Henry, fearful the dispute could be the spark to ignite civil war in Ireland, sought to resolve the matter by arranging an alliance between Piers's son, James, and Anne Boleyn. She would bring her Ormond inheritance as dowry and thus end the dispute. The plan ended in failure, perhaps because Sir Thomas hoped for a grander marriage for his daughter or because he himself coveted the titles. Whatever the reason, the marriage negotiations came to a complete halt. James Butler later married Lady Joan Fitzgerald, daughter and heiress of James FitzGerald, 10th Earl of Desmond and Amy O'Brien.|$|E
5|$|The revolt {{began in}} 1432 when Andrea Thopia {{defeated}} a small Ottoman force in central Albania. His victory encouraged the other {{leaders and the}} revolt spread throughout Albania. Later that year the Ottomans {{lost control of the}} central seaport of Vlorë. Gjergj Arianiti, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>living</b> at the Ottoman court as a hostage, was called by rebels to lead the revolt in his family's domains. In response, he fled from Edirne and returned to Albania. In the winter of 1432, Sultan Murat II gathered around 10.000 troops under Ali Bey, who marched along the Via Egnatia and reached the central valley of Shkumbin, where he was ambushed and defeated by forces under Gjergj Arianiti. His victory prompted the Albanians in the area of Gjirokastër to call upon Depë Zenebishi, who had settled in his estates in Corfu after the Ottoman conquest of the Principality of Gjirokastër, to lead the rebels in the south. After spreading the revolt in nearby areas including Këlcyrë, Zagorie and Pogon his forces besieged the southern city of Gjirokastër, capital of the sanjak of Albania. At nearby Këlcyrë the rebels captured the castle, but the concurrent siege of Gjirokastër was prolonged and Turahan Bey attacked and defeated the troops that surrounded the city in early 1433. Zenebishi himself was captured and executed.|$|E
