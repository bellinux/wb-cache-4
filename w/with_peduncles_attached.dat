40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the incidence and severity of diseases and shelf life of mango under different storage conditions. The {{experiment was}} conducted in Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with three replications. Two varieties of mango, viz., Fazli and Aswina with or without peducnle and four different postharvest treatments, viz., control, hot water, unperforated polythene bag, KMnO 4 in unperforated polythene bag. The postharvest treatments had significant effects on incidence and severity of diseases as all as on the shelf life of mango. The variety Fazli was more susceptible to postharvest disease than Aswina. The highest disease incidence (51. 06 %) was observed in Fazli where as the lowest (44. 22 %) disease incidence was found in Aswina. Postharvest diseases were severe {{at the end of}} the storage period and the maximum disease incidence (100 %) and disease severity (90 %) were recorded in untreated fruits whereas, the minimum disease incidence (77. 08 %) and disease severity (9. 77 %) were noted in fruits wrapped with unperforated polythene bag with KMnO 4. THe postharvest treatments showed highly significant variation on shelf life of mango. The maximum shelf life (15. 04) days was observed in Aswina and the minimum (14. 12 Days) was noted in Fazli. The results revealed that unperforated polythene bag with KMnO 4 caused the longest shelf life (17. 58 Days) followed by unperforated polythene bag and hot water treatment while the shortest shelf life (12. 00 Days) was recorded in untreated fruits. Similarly, mango <b>with</b> <b>peduncle</b> had longer shelf life (15. 12 Days) than that of (14. 04 days) without <b>peduncle.</b> Further, mango <b>with</b> <b>peduncle</b> when treated <b>with</b> KMnO 4 + unperforated polythene bag appeared to be the best for extending shelf life.
