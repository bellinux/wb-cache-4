500|$|The album did not chart {{as well in}} the United States as its predecessor, peaking {{at number}} 148 on the Billboard 200. It was, however, the band's first album to chart on the UK Albums Chart, debuting at number 45. Many of the songs on Leave Home were not {{considered}} by Mickey Leigh to be [...] "radio–friendly" [...] because [...] "Carbona Not Glue" [...] was about Intoxicative inhalant. Joey relates: [...] "We thought we had a lotta songs that should've been hits. If you grew up in the sixties, things would just get played and be hits right off the bat. So we thought since our music was doin' something unique that everyone would pick up on that. What really happened was we were so alien that no one <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> us. And so we wouldn't get played" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Ben Richards. The general plot of India and Pakistan {{on the verge of}} nuclear war is based on actual reports of {{conflict}} between the two nations. The beginning was not originally in the script; Richards wanted to feature a submarine crisis, but the producers were not sure what the crisis would be. They eventually decided to have an Indian submarine [...] "taken hostage" [...] by the Pakistanis. They wanted to add a personal stake towards Tariq, by revealing that members of his family live in Pakistan. The intent was to include and develop a potential relationship between Ros and Lawrence {{to the point where they}} bond during their final scenes before the hotel explosion. They also <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> up on the Harry/Ruth relationship, which was not in the original script; so Ben Richards added the scenes as additional dialogue.|$|E

500|$|Pelé {{is one of}} {{the most}} lauded players in history and is {{frequently}} ranked the best player ever. Among his contemporaries, Dutch star Johan Cruyff stated; [...] "Pelé was the only footballer who surpassed the boundaries of logic." [...] Brazil's 1970 FIFA World Cup-winning captain Carlos Alberto Torres opined; [...] "His great secret was improvisation. Those things he did were in one moment. He had an extraordinary perception of the game." [...] Tostão, his strike partner at the 1970 World Cup; [...] "Pelé was the greatest – he was simply flawless. And off the pitch he is always smiling and upbeat. You never see him bad-tempered. He loves being Pelé." [...] His Brazilian teammate Clodoaldo commented on the adulation he witnessed; [...] "In some countries they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> him, in some they wanted to kiss him. In others they even kissed the ground he walked on. I thought it was beautiful, just beautiful." [...] Former Real Madrid and Hungary star Ferenc Puskás stated; [...] "The greatest player in history was Di Stefano. I refuse to classify Pelé as a player. He was above that." ...|$|E

He attended a news conference to support legislation involving the Violence Against Women Act. Martinez was quoted as saying: [...] "With domestic violence, no one <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> the subject with a 10-foot pole. I {{was interested in the}} issue that a boxer, who dishes out violence, could also be thoughtful and do something and people would listen to someone like me.

[...] "Asylum" [...] served to remind Clark that he cannot save everyone when he fails to stop Lionel from giving Lex electric shock therapy, which ultimately erases seven weeks of Lex’s memory that includes his knowledge that Lionel murdered his own parents. Like season two’s [...] "Ryan", Clark is faced with the reality that he is not [...] "God", and that he will fail to save people from time to time.|$|E

60|$|She hung her head, {{afraid of}} the people they met. He looked {{sideways}} at her as they walked. There was a wonderful close down on her face near the ear that he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch.</b> And a certain heaviness, the heaviness of a very full ear of corn that dips slightly in the wind, that there was about her, made his brain spin.

60|$|One {{evening in}} August he came {{when it was}} raining. He came in with his jacket collar turned up, his jacket buttoned close, his face wet.

Yet he sat and talked with her father and mother, meaninglessly, whilst her blood seethed to anguish in her. She <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> him now, only to touch him.|$|E
60|$|But this pity {{she was not}} {{prepared}} to show him: she wanted to pass right out of his life, to forget once and for all that sense of warmth of the soul, of comfort and of peace which she had felt in his presence on that memorable evening at Brestalou.

60|$|Yet {{he wanted}} something. He was {{happy in the}} wet hillside, that was {{overgrown}} and obscure with bushes and flowers. He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> them all, to saturate himself with the touch of them all. He took off his clothes, and sat down naked among the primroses, moving his feet softly among the primroses, his legs, his knees, his arms {{right up to the}} arm-pits, lying down and letting them touch his belly, his breasts. It was such a fine, cool, subtle touch all over him, he seemed to saturate himself with their contact.|$|E
60|$|Clara was, indeed, passionately in {{love with}} him, and he with her, as far as passion went. In the daytime he forgot her a good deal. She {{was working in the}} same building, but he was not aware of it. He was busy, and her {{existence}} was of no matter to him. But all the time she was in her Spiral room she had a sense that he was upstairs, a physical sense of his person in the same building. Every second she expected him to come through the door, and when he came it was a shock to her. But he was often short and offhand with her. He gave her his directions in an official manner, keeping her at bay. With what wits she had left she listened to him. She dared not misunderstand or fail to remember, but it was a cruelty to her. She <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> his chest. She knew exactly how his breast was shapen under the waistcoat, and she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> it. It maddened her to hear his mechanical voice giving orders about the work. She wanted to break through the sham of it, smash the trivial coating of business which covered him with hardness, get at the man again; but she was afraid, and before she could feel one touch of his warmth he was gone, and she ached again.|$|E
60|$|He {{lived in}} a passion of sensual {{discovery}} with her for some time--it was a duel: no love, no words, no kisses even, only the maddening perception of beauty consummate, absolute through touch. He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> her, to discover her, maddeningly {{he wanted to know}} her. Yet he must not hurry, or he missed everything. He must enjoy one beauty at a time. And the multitudinous beauties of her body, the many little rapturous places, sent him mad with delight, and with desire to be able to know more, to have strength to know more. For all was there.|$|E

They came thronging round her with flushed faces and bright eyes, they wanted to come near her, <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> her, wanted to assure her that for her they were quite prepared to live in any kind of place.

60|$|When {{he lay in}} bed {{he seemed}} still to see her sitting {{in the corner of}} the railway carriage, with the white crochet shawl over her head. He did not know how he was to get through the hours that must pass before his eyes rested on her again. He thought drowsily of her thin face, with its {{delicate}} features, and the greenish pallor of her skin. He was not happy with her, but he was unhappy away from her. He wanted to sit by her side and look at her, he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> her, he wanted... the thought came to him and he did not finish it, suddenly he grew wide awake... he wanted to kiss the thin, pale mouth with its narrow lips. The truth came to him at last. He was in love with her. It was incredible.|$|E
