5000|$|One study {{performed}} a sensitive immuno-histochemical assay on bone marrow aspirates of 20 patients <b>with</b> localized <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer.</b> Three monoclonal antibodies (T16, C26, and AE-1), capable of recognizing membrane and cytoskeletal antigens expressed by epithelial cells to detect tumour cells, {{were used in}} the assay. Bone marrow aspirates of 22% of patients <b>with</b> localized <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer</b> (stage B, 0/5; Stage C, 2/4), and 36% patients <b>with</b> metastatic <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer</b> (Stage D1, 0/7 patients; Stage D2, 4/4 patients) had antigen-positive cells in their bone marrow. It was concluded that immuno-histochemical staining of bone marrow aspirates are very useful to detect occult bone marrow metastases in patients <b>with</b> apparently localized <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer.</b>|$|R
40|$|Androgen {{deprivation}} therapy (ADT) {{has been}} used to treat patients <b>with</b> metastatic <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer</b> for many years. Docetaxel chemotherapy administered to patients <b>with</b> metastatic castrate-resistant <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer</b> has been standard since 2004 with a modest survival benefit. Recent data from two randomised studies (CHAARTED and STAMPEDE) demonstrate that combining ADT with docetaxel in men <b>with</b> hormone-naïve metastatic <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer</b> resulted in an impressive overall survival benefit of more than a year as compared with ADT alone. In a meta-analysis, the consistency of these data was confirmed. On the basis of these data, addition of six 3 -weekly courses of docetaxel to ADT should be considered as standard treatment in chemo-fit patients <b>with</b> hormone-naïve metastatic <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer...</b>|$|R

5|$|From 1977 to 1983, Ford was {{a member}} of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. He first sought the post of Democratic whip in 1988, but lost to California's Alan Cranston, who had held the post since 1977. Ford got a late start in the race, and a New York Times writer opined that he {{overestimated}} his chances of unseating Cranston. Immediately after conceding his loss, he announced he would be a candidate for the position in the next election in 1990. He again faced Cranston in the election, but Cranston withdrew from the race due to a battle <b>with</b> <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer.</b> Ford maintained that he had enough commitments of support in the Democratic caucus to have won without Cranston's withdrawal. When majority leader George J. Mitchell retired from the Senate in 1994, Ford showed some interest in the Democratic floor leader post. Ultimately, he decided against it, choosing to focus instead on Kentucky issues. He supported Christopher Dodd for majority leader.|$|E
5|$|Once the 1999 season started, {{a moment}} of peace {{occurred}} between the fans. Yankees manager Joe Torre returned to Fenway Park for his first game following a battle <b>with</b> <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer.</b> While the managers were exchanging lineup cards, the Boston crowd gave Torre a long standing ovation, to which he tipped his cap. Good relations were seen during the All-Star Game at Fenway Park. Yankee manager Joe Torre, manager for the American League team, replaced starting shortstop Nomar Garciaparra of the Red Sox with Derek Jeter. Garciaparra received a standing ovation from the fans after Jeter came in to replace him (they also embraced each other at this time). Later in the game, {{when he came to}} bat, Jeter gave Garciaparra a tribute by mimicking his batting stance. Nine years later, in a similar fashion, Red Sox manager Terry Francona managed the American League team at the All-Star Game at Yankee Stadium, in the stadium's final season.|$|E
5|$|When New York's long-serving U.S. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan {{announced}} his retirement in November 1998, several prominent Democratic figures, including Representative Charles Rangel of New York, urged Clinton to run for Moynihan's open seat in the Senate election of 2000. Once she decided to run, the Clintons purchased a home in Chappaqua, New York, north of New York City, in September 1999. She became the first First Lady of the United States to {{be a candidate for}} elected office. Initially, Clinton expected to face Rudy Giuliani (the mayor of New York City) as her Republican opponent in the election. Giuliani withdrew from the race in May 2000 after he was diagnosed <b>with</b> <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer</b> and matters related to his failing marriage became public and Clinton instead faced Rick Lazio, a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives representing New York's 2nd congressional district. Throughout the campaign, opponents accused Clinton of carpetbagging, as she had never resided in New York nor participated in the state's politics before the 2000 Senate race.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES To {{analyze the}} {{correlation}} of computed tomography (CT) perfusion parameters blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV), and mean transit time (MTT) <b>with</b> presurgical <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer</b> data. METHODS Ninety-eight patients <b>with</b> biopsy-proven <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer</b> underwent a CT-perfusion scan of the prostate. MTT, BF, and BV were determined and correlated with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, tumor load and Gleason score of transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsy specimens. RESULTS Mean BF was 41. 3 ml/ 100 ml*min(- 1), BV 5. 2 ml/ 100 ml, MTT 8. 7 s. Moderate correlations were observed between Gleason score and BF (0. 35) and between PSA and BF (0. 33) and BV (0. 30).

50|$|Several {{studies have}} {{concluded}} that ADT has demonstrated benefit in patients with metastatic disease, and {{as an adjunct to}} radiation therapy in patients with locally advanced disease. However, in patients <b>with</b> localized <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer,</b> confined to the prostate, ADT has demonstrated no survival advantage, and significant harm, such as impotence, diabetes and bone loss. Even so, 80% of American doctors provide ADT to patients <b>with</b> localized <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer.</b>|$|R
5|$|The political, {{social, and}} {{economic}} crises also touched {{the issue of}} who would succeed Houphouët-Boigny as head of state. After severing ties with his former political heir Philippe Yacé in 1980, who, {{as president of the}} National Assembly, was entitled to exercise the full functions of President of the Republic if the Head of State was incapacitated or absent, Houphouët-Boigny delayed {{as much as he could}} in officially designating a successor. The president's health became increasingly fragile, with Prime Minister Alassane Ouattara administering the country from 1990 onwards, while the president was hospitalised in France. There was a struggle for power, which ended when Houphouët-Boigny rejected Ouattara in favour of Henri Konan Bédié, the President of the National Assembly. In December 1993, Houphouët-Boigny, terminally ill <b>with</b> <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer,</b> was urgently flown back to Côte d'Ivoire so he could die there. He was kept on life support to ensure that the last dispositions concerning his succession were defined. After his family consented, Houphouët-Boigny was disconnected from life support at 6:35am GMT on 7 December. At the time of his death, Houphouët-Boigny was the longest-serving leader in Africa and the third in the world, after Fidel Castro of Cuba and Kim Il Sung of North Korea.|$|E

40|$|<b>Prostate</b> <b>cancer</b> is {{the most}} {{frequent}} and second most lethal cancer in men in the United States. Innate immunity and inflammation may {{increase the risk of}} <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer.</b> To determine the role of innate immunity and inflammation in advanced <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer,</b> we investigated the association of 320 single nucleotide polymorphisms, located in 46 genes involved in this pathway, with disease risk using 494 cases with advanced disease and 536 controls from Cleveland, Ohio. Taken together, the whole pathway was associated <b>with</b> advanced <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer</b> risk (P = 0. 02). Two sub-pathways (intracellular antiviral molecules and extracellular pattern recognition) and four genes in these sub-pathways (TLR 1, TLR 6, OAS 1, and OAS 2) were nominally associated <b>with</b> advanced <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer</b> risk and harbor several SNPs nominally associated <b>with</b> advanced <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer</b> risk.
