40|$|Numerical weather {{predictions}} {{provided by}} <b>world</b> <b>meteorological</b> <b>organizations</b> like ECMWF are unique sources of valuable {{information about the}} meteorological situation on a global scale. This paper introduces a technique to derive the spatial distribution of rainfall rate for a given area and time interval, in terms of complementary cumulative distribution function, PS(R), from {{the knowledge of the}} corresponding total rain amount, Mt, and of the ratio between convective and total rain amounts Ã 9 ̆f. The performance of the method is tested against a large database of radar derived rain field data, from which both the inputs to the algorithm and the associated output PS(R) s are obtained...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been {{considerable}} interest in chlorine-containing trace gases in the atmosphere, particularly in Antarctica because {{of the relationship between}} chlorofluorocarbons and the antarctic ozone hole. All chlorinecontaining trace gases, whether produced by human activities or by natural processes, have a potential for destroying ozone in the stratosphere. This is a complex environmental problem, {{but it is clear that}} manmade chlorine-containing gases are the driving force behind the antarctic ozone hole and, by extension, reductions of stratospheric ozone over other parts of the <b>world</b> [World <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Organization</b> (WMO) 1989, 1991, 1995]. We have taken measurements of the major chlorine-containing gases in Antarctica for more than 20 years, first at Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station and more recently at Palmer Station (64. 46 °S 64. 04 °W). Here we report the results of this work. During recent years, major changes in the concentration of ozone-depleting compounds have taken place in Antarctica because of the Montreal Protocol, which is designed to phase out the production of chlorofluorocarbons and related compounds, to prevent the destruction of the ozone layer (WMO 1995) ...|$|R
