Under the occupation, he refused to collaborate with the German-backed radio and was sacked and arrested. He was sent to Fort Breendonk, a German prison camp near Mechelen. Released in 1941, he was placed under surveillance by the German authorities in Brussels, but succeeded in escaping to Britain via the Zéro network in July 1942 where he joined Antoine Delfosse, minister and commander of the Armée de la Libération (AL) the principal resistance group. He served alongside Delfosse in the Ministry of Justice of the Belgian government in London. He also spoke on Radio Belgique, the French and Dutch language radio station of the BBC broadcast to occupied Belgium. His principal work, however, was in the Commission belge pour l'étude des problèmes d'après-guerre ("Belgian Commission of study of post-war problems"), in which he founded Mission Samoyède which planned to set up radio broadcasting in Belgium soon after the liberation. Following the invasion of Europe by the Allies, {{he returned to the}} continent working as an interpreter and press officer alongside General Henning Linden. His coverage included the liberation of Dachau concentration camp.|$|E

2500|$|After Matthias's income {{increased}} periodically, simultaneously, {{the number}} of mercenaries increased as well. Historical records vary {{when it comes to}} numbers, mainly because it changed from battle to battle and most soldiers were only employed for the duration of combat or a longer conflict. Reckoning the nobility's banners, the mercenaries, the soldiers of conquered Moravia and Silesia, and the troops of allied Moldavia and Wallachia, the King could have gathered an army of 90,000 men. [...] The nobility's participation in the battlefield were ignored by the time their support could have been redeemed in gold later on.

5000|$|However, {{he succeeded}} in pushing new {{taxation}} measures through the National Assembly. In July 1919, Erzberger introduced {{what became known as}} [...] "Erzberger finance reform." [...] The reform pursued two goals. First, it was to give the German federal government supreme authority to tax and spend and thus end the dependence of the central government on the constituent states, as in the former German Empire. Second, Erzberger aimed for a significant redistribution of the tax burden in favour of low- to moderate income households. In July 1919, Kriegsabgaben (<b>war</b> <b>levies)</b> on income and wealth were introduced, as well as the first German inheritance tax. In December 1919, an additional Reichsnotopfer (a one-time [...] "emergency" [...] tax on wealth) was levied, causing outrage among the better-off. In March 1920, a federal income tax followed. Its high tax rates made Erzberger even more unpopular with many on the right.|$|R
