5|$|Sullivan's version added {{women to}} the story; there were no {{significant}} female characters in Stevenson's original. The presence of women (especially Jekyll's fiancée, Agnes Carew) placed Jekyll in traditional social relationships, which made him seem more normal by contemporaneous standards. Hyde behaved lecherously towards Agnes and cruelly towards his landlady, and his behavior towards <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> and later adaptations led to new interpretations of the character. In Stevenson's novella and Sullivan's play, Hyde is said to have committed unspecified crimes. Interpreters began to identify the crimes as sexual, positing sexual repression as a factor in Hyde's characterization. However, Stevenson denied that this was his understanding of the character in his original story.|$|E
5|$|Globally, {{cervical}} {{cancer is the}} fourth commonest cancer amongst women, particularly those of lower socioeconomic status. <b>Women</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> group have reduced access to health care, high rates of child and forced marriage, parity, polygamy and exposure to STIs from multiple sexual contacts of male partners. All of these factors place them at higher risk. In developing countries, {{cervical cancer}} accounts for 12% of cancer cases amongst women and is the second leading cause of death, where about 85% of the global burden of over 500,000 cases and 250,000 deaths from this disease occurred in 2012. The highest incidence occurs in Eastern Africa, where with Middle Africa, cervical cancer is the commonest cancer in women. The case fatality rate of 52% is also higher in developing countries than in developed countries (43%), and the mortality rate varies by 18-fold between regions of the world.|$|E
25|$|To further {{enhance the}} desired pale complexion, women layered white make-up on their faces. This make-up, called Ceruse, {{was made up}} of white lead and vinegar. Women wearing ceruse {{achieved}} the white face, however, the white lead that was used to make it is poisonous. <b>Women</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> time often contracted lead poisoning which resulted in deaths before the age of 50. Other ingredients used as make-up were sulfur, alum, and tin ash. In addition to using make-up to achieve the pale complexion, <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> era were bled to take the color out of their faces.|$|E

They checked and treated women, mainly prostitutes, for venereal diseases. Another important task was the “forensic examination” of <b>women.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> respect, hakimas operated in legal setting.

Throughout the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, and the Netherlands, studies have shown that Russian individuals and organized crime groups are importing women from Russia, Ukraine, the Baltic States, and Central Europe into the Russian sex industry to work in stripping, prostitution, peep and show club services, and massage and escort services, among others.|$|E
25|$|In what {{is thought}} to be an archaic {{survival}} in some versions of Iorwerth it is stated that women are not entitled to act as sureties or to give sureties. Later versions of this rule in Iorwerth state that women were entitled to give sureties, and could therefore enter into contracts, though they were still not allowed to act as sureties. In Colan, Cyfnerth and some of the Latin texts women could give sureties and could under certain circumstances act as sureties. This appears to indicate a gradual improvement in the legal position of <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> respect.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the 18th century, {{caring for}} {{pregnant}} women in Europe was confined exclusively to women, and rigorously excluded men. The expectant mother would invite close female {{friends and family members}} to her home to keep her company. Skilled midwives managed all aspects of the labour and delivery. The presence of physicians and surgeons was very rare and only occurred once a serious complication had taken place and the midwife had exhausted all measures to manage the complication. Calling a surgeon was very much a last resort and having men deliver <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> era whatsoever was seen as offending female modesty.|$|E
25|$|Muslims regard Fatimah as {{a loving}} and devoted daughter, mother, wife, a sincere Muslim, and an exemplar for women. It is {{believed}} {{that she was very}} close to her father and her distinction from other women is mentioned in many hadith. After Khadijah, Muslims regard Fatimah as the most significant historical figure, considered to be the leader (Arabic: Sayyidih) of all <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> world and in Paradise. It is because of her moral purity that she occupies an analogous position in Islam to that Mary occupies in Catholic Christianity. She was the first wife of Ali, whom Sunnis consider the fourth Rashidun caliph and the first infallible Imam (Shi'a doctrine), the mother of the second and third Imams, and the ancestor of all the succeeding Imams; indeed, the Fatimid Caliphate is named after her.|$|E
25|$|A {{representative}} {{study done}} from 2001 to 2002 in Australia found that 1.8% of sexually active people (2.2% men, 1.3% women but no significant sex difference) {{had engaged in}} BDSM activity in the previous year. Of the entire sample, 1.8% men and 1.3% women {{had been involved in}} BDSM. BDSM activity was significantly more likely among bisexuals and homosexuals of both sexes. But among men in general, there was no relationship effect of age, education, language spoken at home, or relationship status. Among <b>women,</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> study, activity was most common for those between 16 and 19 years of age and least likely for females over 50 years. Activity was also significantly more likely for women who had a regular partner they did not live with, but was not significantly related with speaking a language other than English or education.|$|E

2500|$|The film Being John Malkovich {{has many}} Shakespeare allusions, {{including}} {{a scene in}} which Malkovich is shown rehearsing Richard IIIs lines [...] "Was ever <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> humour woo'd? / Was ever <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> humour won?" [...] where Richard is boasting about using power, lies, and crime to seduce Lady Anne. As Visual Cultures professor Lynn Turner notes, this scene anticipates a parallel scene in which Craig uses deceit to seduce Maxine through Malkovich. Mariangela Tempera has noted that the subservience of Lady Anne in the scene contrasts with the self-assertiveness of the actress playing Lady Anne as she seduces Malkovich offstage.|$|R
500|$|In {{politics}} {{the theory}} of patriarchy was complicated by regencies led by Margaret Tudor and Mary of Guise and by {{the advent of a}} regnant queen in Mary, Queen of Scots from 1561. Concerns over this threat to male authority were exemplified by John Knox's The First Blast of the Trumpet Against the Monstruous Regiment of Women (1558), which advocated the deposition of all reigning queens. Most of the political nation took a pragmatic view of the situation, accepting Mary as queen, but the strains that this paradox created may have played a part in the later difficulties of the reign. How exactly patriarchy worked in practice is difficult to discern. Scottish <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> period had something of a reputation among foreign observers for being forthright individuals, with the Spanish ambassador to the court of James IV noting that they were [...] "absolute mistresses of their houses and even their husbands".|$|E
500|$|While {{among the}} wealthy, married women often focused on running the household, lower down in society they {{also worked with}} their husbands.

They had a particular role as shearers in the harvest, forming most of the reaping team of the bandwin. In the Highlands {{they may have been}} even more significant as workers as there is evidence that many men considered agricultural work to be beneath their status and in places they may have formed the majority of the rural workforce. There was a stress on a wife's duties to her husband and on the virtues of chastity and obedience. How exactly patriarchy worked in practice is difficult to discern. Scottish <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> period had something of a reputation among foreign observers for being forthright individuals, with the Spanish ambassador to the court of James IV (r. 1488–1513) noting that they were [...] "absolute mistresses of their houses and even their husbands".|$|E
