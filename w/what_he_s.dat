40|$|Abstract: Biometrics {{represents}} {{a return to}} a natural way of identification: testing someone by <b>what</b> (<b>s)</b> <b>he</b> is, instead of relying on something (<b>s)</b> <b>he</b> owns or knows seems likely to be the way forward. Biometric systems that include multiple sources of information are known as multimodal. Such systems are generally regarded as an alternative to fight a variety of problems all unimodal systems stumble upon. One of the main challenges found in the development of biometric recognition systems is the shortage of publicly available databases acquired under real unconstrained working conditions. Motivated by such need the MobBIO database was created using an Asus EeePad Transformer tablet, with mobile biometric systems in mind. The proposed database is composed by three modalities: iris, face and voice. ...|$|R
40|$|Who is the coach? The {{coach is}} the guy {{running up and down}} {{at the side of the}} {{football}} field trying to extort the win from the team without ever hitting the ball. So <b>what</b> (<b>s)</b> <b>he</b> does? The coach teaches her/his client. The coach deals with the processes and tries to teach her/his client by helping looking behind the processes. To be able to explain this properly, we need to revisit the very basis of system thinking. In this paper we will discuss and somewhat rearrange the layers of systems to reformulate how we see systems to finally make the role of the systemist clear...|$|R
40|$|The tourist {{photographs}} {{everything that}} is a motif of his journey: objects that constitute historical and cultural attractions of the chosen place. Nevertheless, (<b>s)</b> <b>he</b> photographs these things somehow because of his/her duty. There are several circumstances that decide of the specificity of tourists' photographing. Most of all, the tourist takes pictures of himself. He/she desires to have pictures of himself/herself in unusual, magical and famous places. Among different objects, the tourist chose those, which are apt to make impression on people who will see the photographs. Moreover, the tourist brings his/her stereotypes with himself. Already before the departure, (<b>s)</b> <b>he</b> knows <b>what</b> (<b>s)</b> <b>he</b> should see and {{what it will be}} like. He/she already knows what the landscape, monuments, and people will be like. That is why the tourist photographs everything that suits this idea. In the same time, however, the tourist looks for peculiarity, oddness, and exoticism. He/she needs authenticity, but the one (<b>s)</b> <b>he</b> somehow imagined before. He/she also looks for originality and vernacularism. The tourist is oblivious {{of the fact that the}} peculiarity and the alleged authenticity are created and stylised in many ways...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The article {{presents}} some evaluations of four aspects of word length in dif-ferent languages and compares both models and data: distribution, smoothness, word length in sentence, word length in text. A general {{discussion of the}} theoretical back-ground is offered. As is shown, even these four problems require great teams, {{in order to bring}} elementary concepts and decisions. The number of co-authors should not surprise: everybody did <b>what</b> (<b>s)</b> <b>he</b> could. The word has as many properties as we are able to establish conceptually. Some of these properties supported the rise of different disciplines like semantics, mor-phology, dialectology, historical linguistics, etc. Some laws of behaviour of these properties are known, but the number of surprises- possibly concealed behin...|$|R
40|$|The adjunct {{is defined}} as the spatio-temporal and causal {{background}} in which the content ofthe utterance will be correct. The adjunct is not always facultative, even on the syntactic level. Thisis the case, especially when it is a part of a binary system: the removal of one of the two elementsmakes the sentence ungrammatical. In terms of information, the speaker builds his/her utterance bytaking into consideration <b>what</b> (<b>s)</b> <b>he</b> assumes to be the addressee’s knowledge. The spatio-temporalor causal background may be new, but it may be considered by the speaker {{as a part of the}} Theme,and it is placed at the beginning of the utterance. When the background is well known by theaddressee, we may wonder why the speaker needs to repeat it.

40|$|The {{first phase}} in {{developing}} information systems {{is often called}} conceptual modelling phase. The model constructed is the first formal document describing the desired system. The conceptual model must deal with structural and behavioural aspects of the world. The complexity of such a model often prevents a detailed understanding by the customers. One way to estimate if (<b>s)</b> <b>he</b> really gets <b>what</b> (<b>s)</b> <b>he</b> wants are prototype systems constructed by conventional programming. We propose a way to construct prototypes out of formal specifications by means of transformation into a kernel language that can be executed in a suitable distributed runtime environment. We introduce the modelling language, the basic execution mechanism, and the basic architecture of the runtime system. 1 Introduction A large number of software systems {{can be characterized as}} information systems. The purpose of an information system is to realize parts of the world usually called Universe of Discourse (UoD) in a computer [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a model of}} intertemporal preferences where the decision maker evaluates outcomes in terms of gains and losses, in comparison with <b>what</b> (<b>s)</b> <b>he</b> has been accustomed to in the past. More specifically, we examine the properties of a discounted utility model where utility exhibits reference-dependence and loss aversion, and where the reference point follows a single exponential smoothing process. The model predicts and explains the most common anomalies with respect to classical discounted utility theory. Properties are given in terms of impatience, dynamic consistency, and attitude towards variations. In order to demonstrate {{the potential of the}} model, we apply it to the study of an agent's participation in a multi-period relationship. We show that initial participation may require a commitment from the principal regarding future contracts. This leads us to a brief discussion about wage profiles across time and other related subjects...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} learn the nurses' opinion {{concerning}} the work they perform with families {{in the context of}} the Family Health Program and which are the necessary competences to accomplish it. This is an exploratory-descriptive study, of qualitative nature, carried out with 20 nurses who worked at a Family Health Center. The data were collected through a semi-structured interview and the Bardin's referential was used for the analysis of content. The results revealed that the work with families is structured based on the actions and relationships existent between the professionals and the families, because the establishment and maintenance of such relations interfere in the quality of the assistance. Regarding the necessary competences, the importance of the scientific technical knowledge (know-how) and especially the ability to relate with the families and with other team members are emphasized. In addition, commitment, involvement and ethical posture were named, which are aspects easily reached when a person likes <b>what</b> (<b>s)</b> <b>he</b> does...|$|R

40|$|Whom I call 'epistemic reductionists' in {{this article}} are critics of the notion of 'moral luck' that {{maintain}} that all supposed cases of moral luck are illusory; they are in fact cases of what I describe as a special form of epistemic luck, the only difference lying in what we get to know about someone, rather than in <b>what</b> (<b>s)</b> <b>he</b> deserves in terms of praise or blame. I argue that epistemic reductionists are mistaken. They implausibly separate judgements of character from judgements concerning acts, and they assume a conception of character that is untenable both from a common sense perspective and with a view to findings from social psychology. I use especially the example of Scobie, the protagonist of Graham Greene's novel The Heart of the Matter, to show that moral luck is real-that there are cases of moral luck that cannot be reduced to epistemic luck. The reality of moral luck, in this example at least, lies in its impact on character and personal and moral identity. © 2009 Springer Science Media B. V...|$|R
