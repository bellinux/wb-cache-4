5|$|In the 1995 film GoldenEye, Bean portrayed James Bond's nemesis Alec Trevelyan (MI6's 006). He {{played the}} weak-stomached Spence in Ronin (1998), a wife-beating ex-con in Essex Boys (2000), and a malevolent kidnapper/jewel thief in Don't Say a Word (2001). He was also widely {{recognised}} as villainous treasure hunter Ian Howe in National Treasure, {{and played a}} villainous scientist in The Island (2005). In the independent film Far North, he plays a Russian mercenary who gets lost in the tundra and is rescued by an Inuit <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> daughter, whom he later pits against one another.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} law was passed, {{questions}} arose about {{the legal status of}} marriage to non-Spaniards after a Spaniard and an Indian national living in Catalonia were denied a marriage license on the grounds that India did not permit same-sex marriage. However, on 22 July, another judge in Catalonia married a Spanish <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> Argentinian national partner (the first same-sex marriage between women in Spain). This judge disagreed with his colleague's decision and gave preference to the right of marriage over Argentinian law at the time not allowing same-sex marriage.|$|E

50|$|In 1893, Charles Crittenton {{was joined}} in the {{movement}} by pioneering female physician Dr. Kate Waller Barrett. Barrett was famous for her progressive ideas about education <b>and</b> training for <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> tireless advocacy for girls, <b>women</b> <b>and</b> their families.|$|R
5|$|After seeing Nankiwi in the plane, a {{small group}} of Huaorani decided to make the trip to Palm Beach, and left the {{following}} morning, January 7. On the way, they encountered Nankiwi and the girl, returning unescorted. The girl's brother, Nampa, was furious at this, and to defuse the situation and divert attention from himself, Nankiwi claimed that the foreigners had attacked them on the beach, and in their haste to flee, they had been separated from their chaperone. Gikita, {{a senior member of the}} group whose experience with outsiders had taught him that they could not be trusted, recommended that they kill the foreigners. The return of the older <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> account of the friendliness of the missionaries was not enough to dissuade them, and they soon continued toward the beach.|$|E
5|$|Buchanan rarely {{consulted}} Breckinridge {{when making}} patronage appointments, and meetings {{between the two}} were infrequent. When Breckinridge and Buchanan endorsed the Lecompton Constitution, which would have admitted Kansas as a slave state instead of allowing the people to vote, they managed to alienate most Northern Democrats, including Douglas. This disagreement ended plans for Breckinridge, Douglas, and Minnesota's Henry Mower Rice to build {{a series of three}} elaborate, conjoined row houses in which to live during their time in Washington, D.C. In November 1857, after Breckinridge found alternative lodging in Washington, he sold a slave <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> young infant which, according to historian James C. Klotter, probably ended his days as a slaveholder. When Breckinridge did not travel to Illinois to campaign for Douglas's re-election to the Senate and gave him only a lukewarm endorsement, relations between them worsened.|$|E
5|$|Flooding also {{occurred}} in Cuba. Hundreds were evacuated {{their homes in}} four different provinces in Cuba, including 400peasant families in Oriente Province. Near Santiago de Cuba, 25houses were swept away after the Bayamo River overflowed. In the same area, a <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> four sons drowned due to the swollen river. Additionally, a body of a man was recovered near Santa Cruz del Sur. Hundreds of livestock drowned, and telephone and telegraph services were disrupted in many areas. Losses in Cuba were estimated to have reached $100,000. Ella {{had a role in}} the Cuban Revolution as the government troops of Fulgencio Batista y Zaldívar stayed in their barracks during the storm while the rebels made progress under cover of Ella. Later, when the guerrillas heard about Hurricane Fifi on the radio, Che Guevara taught his illiterate comrades that entities like tropical cyclones are named in alphabetical order.|$|E

5|$|In March 1782, 160 Pennsylvania militiamen under Lieutenant Colonel David Williamson rode {{into the}} Ohio Country, {{hoping to find}} the warriors who were {{responsible}} for raids against Pennsylvania settlers. Enraged by the gruesome murder by Indians of a white <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> baby, Williamson's men detained about 100 Christian Delawares at the village of Gnadenhütten. The Christian Delawares (mostly women and children) had returned to Gnadenhütten from Captive Town in order to harvest the crops they {{had been forced to}} leave behind. Accusing the Christian Indians of having aided hostile raiding parties, the Pennsylvanians murdered them all by hammer blows to the head. The Gnadenhutten massacre, as it came to be called, would have serious repercussions for the next American expedition into the Ohio Country.|$|E
5|$|Raya, a young Ukrainian <b>woman,</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> friend Luba {{are sold}} to a Bosnian sex-trafficking ring by a relative. Raya escapes with Irka, another girl forced into prostitution, and they are sent to a women's shelter for victims of human trafficking. While {{investigating}} their case, Kathryn uncovers a large-scale sexual slavery ring utilized by international personnel (including Americans). She persuades Raya and Irka to testify against their traffickers in court, guaranteeing their safety; however, an indifferent UN official drops Irka at the border between Bosnia and Serbia when she cannot produce a passport. A corrupt peacekeeper tips off the traffickers, and Raya is recaptured and tortured. Although rescued from the woods by Kathryn, Irka is too afraid {{to proceed with the}} trial.|$|E
5|$|The main shock hit Bucharest between {{noon and}} 1 p.m. The {{earthquake}} was felt for about 10minutes {{and was so}} violent that all chimneys in the city collapsed. Numerous historical monuments were destroyed, including St. Nicholas Church, Cotroceni Monastery and the 54-meter-high Colțea Tower. The Greek chronicler Dionysius Fotino reported that Prince Constantine Ypsilantis moved {{with his family to}} the Văcărești Monastery because his palace was severely damaged. However, despite the massive damage to buildings, only four deaths were reported: a Jewish <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> baby, an itinerant merchant killed when Colțea Tower collapsed, and one other victim. The death toll may have been so low because the houses were built far apart and surrounded by large yards and gardens, so the buildings' vibrations did not propagate. Also, the building materials—mostly shingle and timber—were light.|$|E
50|$|Murphy's {{success in}} the fight for the Dower Act, along with her work through the Local Council of <b>Women</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> {{increasing}} awareness of women's rights, influenced her request for a female magistrate in the women's court.|$|R

5|$|The town {{suffered}} {{very little}} from the bombing {{runs in the}} Second World War that did damage to many English locations. The worst case in Shrewsbury was in 1940, a <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> two grandchildren were killed when a cottage was destroyed on Ellesmere Road, the only local air raid deaths. Therefore, many of its ancient buildings remain intact and there was little redevelopment in the 1960s and 1970s, which arguably destroyed the character of many historic towns in the UK. However, some historic buildings were demolished {{to make way for}} the brutalist architectural style of the 1960s, though the town was saved from a new 'inner ring road' due to its challenging geography. Two notable examples of 1960s/70s construction in Shrewsbury were demolished in the 2000s — the Telecom Tower on Smithfield Road and the multi-storey car park at St Austin's Friars.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins as}} the protagonist parks {{her car and}} cries {{following}} an argument she has had with her lover. She then leaves the car, walks towards the sea, and lets down her hair. Flashbacks of the <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> lover on the beach are shown. With teary eyes, she heads into the sea as waves break the shore. Back in the car, she imagines her lover holding her hands. The video transitions into color, as Beyoncé's character appears {{on the beach in}} a green dress and holds a rose without its petals, which she later restores. The video then flashes back to black-and-white memories of the woman resting her head on her lover's shoulder. She eventually realizes that she must set her relationship back on the right track. In the end, she drives off with a smile.|$|E

25|$|Firstly, {{steel making}} was a defense industry, so {{they wanted to}} be sure {{national}} security was not endangered. Second, she was a woman, and in those days, people wondered if a <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> delicate cameras could stand up to the intense heat, hazard, and generally dirty and gritty conditions inside a steel mill. When she finally got permission, technical problems began.|$|E
