25|$|Marjorie Barnard met Flora Eldershaw, {{who was a}} {{year ahead}} of her, in her first year at the University of Sydney. Marjorie Barnard wrote of their first meeting as being ot entirely happy. I was the greenest of green 'freshers'. Flora was {{established}} in her second year. Chance had given me the locker immediately above hers. Its untidy contents frequently spilled out into her more ordered domain. My then meager person was continually underfoot, and Flora's brown eyes flashed with indignation more often than they smiled. But within the year <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>close</b> friends. She widened my horizons and quickened my mind. Later this friendship was to withstand what everyone agrees to be the acid test of collaboration in writing.|$|E
500|$|Kasey Kahne, who {{finished}} second, said, [...] "I hung {{with him for}} about three laps running in his kind of dirty air. I was right there. Then he just slowly crept away. It felt good. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>close.</b> That’s a huge improvement. I was pretty happy." [...] "We had a similar [...] issue {{at the start of}} the Pocono race last year where we broke a fuel cable," [...] Hamlin said after the race. [...] "I thought maybe that’s what we did. When I went to take off , it immediately shut off. While it was [...] "a downer, I was pretty confident we weren’t going to have it again. Because Mike [...] never really gave me an alarm we were going to be stretching it on fuel." [...] In the subsequent press conference, Hamlin's crew chief said, ...|$|E
500|$|At 2 pm on 15 March, as Wasp cruised north-eastwards, Morrell records: [...] "Land {{was seen}} from the masthead, bearing west, {{distance}} 3 leagues" [...] (about nine miles, 14km). He did not at the time consider {{that he had made}} a new discovery; he seems to have assumed that he was seeing the east coast of the Antarctic Peninsula, the western coast of which had been explored and given the name [...] "New South Greenland" [...] in 1821, by Robert Johnson, a former captain of the Wasp. [...] Johnson's name for this land was never adopted; in 1831 it was named Graham Land. At the time of Morrell's voyage the geographical character and dimensions of the peninsula were [...] unknown; Morrell's recorded position was in fact far to the east of the peninsula. Morrell's account reads: [...] "At half past [...] <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>close</b> on with the body of land to which Captain Johnson had given the name of New South Greenland". [...] The next few days were spent exploring this supposed coast, which was apparently rich in seal. Some [...] further south, Morrell thought he could see snow-covered mountains.|$|E
50|$|NOTE: 12/27/2015 -- It is {{with great}} regret that the {{leadership}} of Redmoon informs you that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>closing</b> our doors forever.|$|R
5000|$|... "Bit by bit, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>closer</b> to our {{youthful}} {{dream of}} a health-care revolution that would be Arogya-Swaraj — people's health in people's empowered hands".|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{that way}} we can get down till <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>close</b> to the troops round Rangoon, and must then take our chance of getting through them." ...|$|R
2500|$|When Holden died, President Ronald Reagan {{released}} a statement, saying, [...] "I {{have a great}} feeling of grief. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>close</b> friends for many years. What {{do you say about}} a longtime friend - a sense of personal loss, a fine man. Our friendship never waned." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "We knew {{we could}} have played better in that Test [...] The {{fact that we had}} got so close to the Blacks proved <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>close</b> to them in ability, and {{when it came to the}} third Test in Wellington, we had a sense of giving {{everything}} to salvage our reputation. New Zealand had not won a Test match against Australia in Wellington since 1982. Not so long ago, you might think, but let me tell you, that is a lifetime by New Zealand's standards. And what happened that day really angered me. We played as though our lives depended on it; we tackled them as though they were demons; we knocked them back and we kept at them, mercilessly hounding them when they had possession and flattening them in some shuddering tackles. Not surprisingly, it won us the Test, but immediately apparent was the question: why the hell hadn't we played like that in the first two Tests?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>close</b> behind him, and all saw {{the figure}} of a man run quickly across a little piece of sward and {{disappear}} in the shrubbery beyond.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘It is in vain,’ {{returned}} my father. ‘I should but involve {{you in my}} fate. To {{leave this}} land <b>is</b> hopeless: <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>closed</b> in it as men <b>are</b> <b>closed</b> in life; {{and there is no}} issue but the grave.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Only," [...] replied Martin-Roget with a laugh, [...] "that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>close</b> to {{the coast}} of France and that with this {{unpleasant}} but useful north-westerly wind <b>we</b> shall <b>be</b> in Nantes two hours before midnight." ...|$|R
25|$|After {{eight months}} <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>closer</b> {{together}} than ever. Perhaps C. {{will be remembered}} as the great love of my life. Already I have achieved certain heights reached with no other love.|$|R
60|$|It {{was just}} when I {{believed}} <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>close</b> upon {{the spot where}} the Avenger should be stopped, that Jerry came tip-toeing aft, waving his arms to attract our attention.|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} we were so nearly winded that it was {{impossible}} to continue the flight without a breathing spell, and the old man allowed us to halt when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>close</b> upon the city.|$|E
6000|$|He did {{not hear}} us until <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>close</b> upon him, and even after he turned, my mother hesitated, so thin, so hollow-eyed, so changed was he. [...] "Richard, is that you?" [...] she quaveringly asked.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, come on; <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>close</b> to our journey's end. The St. Germain road opens just round this corner, {{and then}} we shall see our way, for the lights will guide us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is in vain," [...] {{returned}} my father. [...] "I should but involve {{you in my}} fate. To {{leave this}} land <b>is</b> hopeless: <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>closed</b> in it as men <b>are</b> <b>closed</b> in life; {{and there is no}} issue but the grave." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That shows <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>close</b> to {{the surface}} of the ground," [...] said he. [...] "If the worst comes to the worst, I fancy we can dig our way upward with our hands." ...|$|R
60|$|The driver {{pushed his}} team to a fast trot, which gait surely covered ground rapidly. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>close</b> behind Colonel Sampson, who, from his vehement gestures, must {{have been engaged in}} very earnest {{colloquy}} with his companions.|$|E
6000|$|... "It wouldn't {{have been}} of any account if we hadn't been chasing a pair of horses of mine that were stolen at Sawyer. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>close</b> behind them, and should have {{overtaken}} them by this time if it hadn't been for this delay." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And how are you?" [...] said Miss Havisham to Camilla. As <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>close</b> to Camilla then, I {{would have}} stopped {{as a matter of}} course, only Miss Havisham wouldn't stop. We swept on, and I felt that I was highly obnoxious to Camilla.|$|E
5000|$|... "Although <b>we</b> <b>are</b> {{separated}} by miles, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>closer</b> together in mutual struggle {{for freedom and}} human brotherhood... there is no basic difference between colonialism and segregation... our struggles are not only similar; {{they are in a}} real sense one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell {{her that}} <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>close</b> at hand, {{and that we}} have {{powerful}} friends," [...] I whispered. [...] "We shall get to see her somehow or other, and if she chooses to return she shall!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think we}} near him! The rough water is helping us, and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>closing.</b> Steer small, fellow; steer small! You see {{the color of}} his {{mouldings}} begins to show, when he lifts on the seas." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Chuzz-flick," [...] {{just one}} arrow came. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>close</b> on the Selenites, {{and they were}} {{standing}} in a crowd, broad, short, and tall together, with a little battery of their shooting implements pointing down the cave. Three or four other arrows followed the first, then their fire ceased.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>close</b> to the door: {{we passed}} it, and I flung a glance into the vestibule. There, sure enough, {{at the head}} of the stairs, was posted my friend of the {{moleskin}} waistcoat, in talk with a confederate by some shades uglier than himself, a red-headed, loose-legged scoundrel in cinder-grey.|$|E
60|$|His words brought anxiety {{into the}} faces of the other hunters. A Russian could mean but one thing—a cruiser. The hunters, never more than roughly aware of the {{position}} of the ship, nevertheless knew that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>close</b> to the boundaries of the forbidden sea, while Wolf Larsen’s record as a poacher was notorious. All eyes centred upon him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] {{answered}} the Wizard, [...] "it <b>is</b> because <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>close</b> {{to the center}} of the earth, where the attraction of gravitation is very slight. But I've noticed that many queer things happen in fairy countries." ...|$|R
60|$|I am {{wandering}} again. Bear {{with the}} unpremeditated enthusiasm of a citizen who only attained years of discretion at her last birthday. We shall soon {{have done with}} Sandwich; <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>close</b> {{to the door of}} the inn.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>closing</b> on the Little Village, {{with her}} {{three million people}} spread out at ease inside her ring of {{girdling}} Main-Traffic lights--those eight fixed beams at Chatham, Tonbridge, Redhill, Dorking, Woking, St. Albans, Chipping Ongar, and Southend.|$|R
60|$|Delamere Court lies a good {{five miles}} from Pangbourne Station, and we drove for that {{distance}} in an open fly. Lord Linchmere sat in deep thought during the time, and he never opened his mouth until <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>close</b> to our destination. When he did speak it was {{to give me a}} piece of information which surprised me.|$|E
60|$|It {{is almost}} {{impossible}} to give any details of that pursuit, which was not brought to an end until <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>close</b> upon the shore of Oneida Lake, because it was all so confusing--more like the wildest kind of a foot-race, wherein each man was trying to gain the lead, and the hindermost frantic with fear.|$|E
6000|$|... 'What did I do? I {{kept all}} the boats together, and {{headed into the}} track of the {{coasting}} steamers. The aggravating thing was the thought that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>close</b> to land {{as far as a}} big steamer was concerned, {{and in the middle of}} eternity as far as regarded a little boat. The sea looks hugeous big from a boat at night.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is very warm," [...] the wub said. [...] "I {{understand}} that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>close</b> to the jets. Atomic power. You have done many wonderful things with it--technically. Apparently, your scientific hierarchy is {{not equipped to}} solve moral, ethical--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think we}} may as well do so," [...] the mate replied [...] "However, their sharp ears are sure to hear us if <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>close</b> inshore, and <b>we</b> dare not go far out or we might lose our {{bearings}} altogether." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We turn here," [...] she directed. [...] "You see, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>close</b> to home now. My uncle {{will be so}} glad to see you, Mr. Maraton, and I cannot {{tell you}} how delighted I am that you are coming to Lyndwood." ...|$|R
