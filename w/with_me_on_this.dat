It’s a real piece of honesty {{for the first time in}} my life. It’s how I genuinely feel about things, and things that myself and my friends have experienced. Nothing was pushed <b>on</b> <b>me,</b> my label was amazing <b>with</b> joining <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> journey. That’s really inspiring for me, because it makes me believe in my own voice.

6000|$|My own {{motive for}} {{opposing}} {{the bill is}} founded on its palpable injustice, and its certain inefficacy. I have seen the state of these miserable men, {{and it is a}} disgrace to a civilized country. Their excesses may be condemned, but cannot be subject of wonder. The effect of the present bill would be to drive them into actual rebellion. The few words I shall venture to offer on Thursday will be founded upon these opinions formed from my own observations on the spot. By previous inquiry, I am convinced these men would have been restored to employment, and the county to tranquillity. It is, perhaps, not yet too late, and is surely worth the trial. It can never be too late to employ force in such circumstances. I believe your Lordship does not coincide <b>with</b> <b>me</b> entirely <b>on</b> <b>this</b> subject, and most cheerfully and sincerely shall I submit to your superior judgment and experience, and take some other line of argument against the bill, or be silent altogether, should you deem it more advisable.

40|$|During {{this year}} and a half I have been taking the Masters degree, and as a {{requirement}} to finish it, I had to do a Dissertation, which I considered to be the biggest obstacle to overcome in my academic life. The journey throughout these last eighteen months has been heavy in terms of workload; still {{there are a lot of}} good things to take from it. One of the most important things was my group of friends, without whom this Masters would have been much more difficult. With them, I was able to transform times of stress, in times of pleasure. So my first acknowledgment goes to them. I would like to dedicate this dissertation to my family. They have supported me financially and given me strength throughout my entire life. Another person that I need to thank is my girlfriend, Francisca, who has always been there for me, giving me unconditional support all the time. I would also like to thank Enrique Miro Sans, from Grupo Damm, who made all of this possible. I thank him for all the time spent <b>with</b> <b>me</b> working <b>on</b> <b>this</b> dissertation, and I will be forever grateful for his help.

40|$|I {{would like}} to thank Etienne Ghys for sharing <b>with</b> <b>me</b> his ideas <b>on</b> <b>this</b> {{question}} and planting the seeds of this paper in me, and my PhD supervisor, Claude Viterbo, for his remarks and advice. Abstract. In this paper, we study a notion of hyperbolicity for holomorphic foliations with 1 -dimensional parabolic leaves, namely the non-existence of holomorphic cylinders along the foliation – holomorphic maps from D n− 1 × C to the manifold sending each {∗} × C to a leaf. We construct a tensor, that is a leaf-wise holomorphic section of a bundle above the foliated manifold, which vanishes on an open saturated set if and only if there exists such a cylinder through each point of this open set. Thanks to this study, we prove that open sets saturated by compact leaves are union of holomorphic cylinders along the foliation. We also give some more specific results and examples {{in the case of a}} compact manifold, and of foliations with one compact leaf or without any compact leaves...|$|R
40|$|Working <b>on</b> <b>this</b> {{special edition}} {{has been a}} {{rewarding}} experience. My colleague, Tony Onwuegbuzie (who has worked <b>with</b> <b>me</b> closely <b>on</b> <b>this</b> special issue), and I put together our “dream table of contents ” last year, and I am proud to report that our final table of contents is virtually {{identical to the original}} table of contents. We have been privileged to work with an outstanding team of authors who are leaders in mixed research. The authors have painstakingly covered an important set of topics that provides a substantial sample of the latest thinking about mixed research. The three major approaches to research can be broadly conceptualized by drawing a continuum and placing the term qualitative research on the left pole, the term quantitative research on the right pole, and placing the term mixed research in the middle. Although Tony Onwuegbuzie and I recommend that mixed research be based on a broad and inclusive definition (Johnson & Onwuegbuzie, 2004; Onwuegbuzie & Johnson, 2006 in this issue) with much of the area in the continuum falling into the domain of mixed research, many other authors have cogently argued for more specific definitions. I believe there is merit to both of these definitional approaches. Regardless of where methodologists place mixed research on the research continuum, {{it is important to recognize}} that the purpose of mixed research is not to replace qualitative research or quantitative research. There will be many times and places where qualitative research will be preferred over mixed and quantitative research, and there will be many times and places where quantitative research will be preferred over qualitative and mixed research. Qualitative research, quantitative research, and mixed research all have much to offer the research community. This special issue is focused on the “middle ” approach (i. e., mixed research). In the first of the nine articles in this special issue...|$|R
60|$|Phil.--I {{will not}} allow you to treat <b>me</b> <b>with</b> ridicule <b>on</b> <b>this</b> point till you have heard {{the second part of}} my tale. Ten years after I had {{recovered}} from the fever, and when I had almost lost the recollection of the vision, it was recalled to my memory by a very blooming and graceful maiden, fourteen or fifteen years old, that I accidentally met during my travels in Illyria; but I cannot say that the impression made upon my mind by this female was very strong. Now comes the extraordinary part of the narrative. Ten years after, twenty years after my first illness, at a time when I was exceedingly weak from a severe and dangerous malady, which for many weeks threatened my life, and when my mind was almost in a desponding state, being in a course of travels ordered by my medical advisers, I again met the person who was the representative of my visionary female, and to her kindness and care I believe I owe what remains to me of existence. My despondency gradually disappeared, and though my health still continued weak, life began to possess charms for me which I had thought were for ever gone; and I could not help identifying the living angel with the vision which appeared as my guardian genius during the illness of my youth.|$|R
60|$|While I {{examined}} my friend's {{wounds and}} readjusted the bandages, my companions cut down two poles. These we {{laid on the}} ground {{parallel to each other}} and about two feet apart, and across them laid our three coats, which we fastened in a rough fashion by means of some strong cords which I fortunately happened to have <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> <b>On</b> <b>this</b> rude litter we laid our companion, and raised him on our shoulders. Peterkin and I walked in rear, each supporting one of the poles; while Makarooroo, being the stoutest of the three, supported the entire weight of the other ends on his broad shoulders. Jack bore the moving better than we had expected, so that we entertained sanguine hopes that no bones were broken, but that loss of blood was all he had to suffer from.|$|E

I simply pointed out to them that they had no arms, and asked if they could get any; and hearing that there were plenty lying useless a few miles away, suggested that those arms would do more good in their hands than stowed away in magazines. Upon their agreeing <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> head, I advised them to proceed in a quiet and orderly way, and to have no rioting or disturbance of any sort. I said that if they, after arming themselves, came to me and still wished to follow me, I would undertake to command them.

60|$|So it was <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> occasion. I {{found there}} was no {{telegraph}} service at all to this place; I found {{there was only one}} weak thread of train-service. Now if this had been the authority of real English religion, I should have submitted to it at once. If I believed that the telegraph clerk could not send the telegram because he was at that moment rigid in an ecstasy of prayer, I should think all telegrams unimportant in comparison. If I could believe that railway porters when relieved from their duties rushed with passion to the nearest place of worship, I should say that all lectures and everything else ought to give way to such a consideration. I should not complain if the national faith forbade me to make any appointments of labour or self-expression on the Sabbath. But, as it is, it only tells me that I may very probably keep the Sabbath by not keeping the appointment.|$|E
