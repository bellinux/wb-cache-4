500|$|The Santa Fe National Forest's rocky {{terrain and}} steep {{inclines}} proved difficult for conventional camera equipment—such as cranes and dollies—which resulted {{in much of}} the film's scenes being shot by the camera operators, who were rigged to aerial ski lifts above the action. [...] "The location <b>we</b> <b>picked</b> was on top of the ski area above 12,000 feet in Santa Fe, and the high altitude made it extremely physically demanding", Schleissler explained. [...] "All our equipment had to be hand-carried into some of our remote locations, which meant we had to limit ourselves to the bare minimum...No one ever hiked to the set empty-handed, including our producers.

500|$|Nelson and {{the band}} {{encountered}} problems in producing {{some aspects of the}} song. According to Champion, [...] "...it was really difficult to record, because it worked at about five or six different tempos. It was a tough choice of choosing which tempo to play, because sometimes it sounded too rushed, and sometimes it sounded as if it was dragging..." [...] The band was trying to get the right tempo, according to Nelson, [...] "because a beat either side of the tempo <b>we</b> <b>picked</b> didn't have the same groove". To improve the song, they recorded this part live and Buckland overdubbed his guitar. They recorded it two or three times until Nelson {{and the band}} were happy at the output. The backing vocals were recorded in the control room of Quadrangle.|$|E

Adams and Gonzalez are credited as songwriters as a result. In August 2012, Cox revealed that he, Carey and Dupri had started working on Carey's then untitled fourteenth studio album, later revealed to be Me. I Am Mariah...

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{investigated the}} effects of age and experience on length perception. A total of 46 {{participants were asked to}} wield and estimate the length of unseen rods by adjusting a movable board to equal their estimate of the reachable distance of the rod. The results demonstrated that (a) participants used the haptic subsystem of dynamic touch to perceive dissimilarities in object length and (b) experience playing racquet sports was more influential than the effect of age in perceptual judgments regarding object length. The results are discussed {{in the context of the}} ecological approach to haptic perception.

Objects are material things, having mass, and mass resists our efforts to displace it. This resistance generates pressure on the hand, pressure that influences the stimulation of receptors in the skin, muscles, and tendons. For this reason, the act of wielding can provide an impression of the spatial dimensions of the object. This type of perception is known as dynamic touch (Gibson...|$|R
