5|$|Bosworth's {{first film}} role came after an open casting call in New York for the {{supporting}} part of Judith in the 1998 film, The Horse Whisperer. The film's producers needed someone <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> an experienced horse rider, leading to Bosworth's successful audition for the role. The film received positive reception from film critics. In 2000, she {{starred in the}} television series drama Young Americans, in which she played Bella Banks. The series, however, was canceled. That same year, she had a small part in the film Remember the Titans. In 2001, Bosworth moved to Los Angeles in hopes of obtaining easier access to auditions and better film parts.|$|E

The honorary command was assigned to Constantin Coandă, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> the military attaché with Russia's Stavka (General Headquarters).

By age 15, her mother and ballet teachers, who were serving as her custodial guardians, fought a custody battle over her. Meanwhile, Copeland, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> an award-winning dancer, was fielding professional offers. The 1998 legal issues involved filings for emancipation by Copeland and restraining orders by her mother.

5|$|Giacomo Meyerbeer's {{early studies}} {{had been in}} Germany, but from 1816 to 1825 he worked in Italy. There he studied opera, then {{dominated}} by Gioachino Rossini, and wrote his own Italian operas, which were moderately successful and also had some performances in other European countries. The success of Il crociato in Egitto (1824) throughout Europe, including at Paris in 1825, persuaded Meyerbeer, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> thirty-three years old, to fulfil at last his ambition to base himself in Paris, and to seek a suitable libretto for an opera to be launched there.|$|E

Slaughter's New York's 28th congressional district was 29 percent African American, and minorities comprised nearly 40 percent of the Democratic primary vote. Charles B.

5|$|Madison {{served with}} the Kentucky militia during the Northwest Indian War. He was a {{subaltern}} in Arthur St. Clair's army in the American defeat at the Battle of the Wabash on November 4, 1791. During the retreat, a soldier named William Kennan found Madison sitting on a log. Kennan was being pursued by Indians and admonished Madison to run, but Madison, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> known to be of frail constitution, stood to reveal {{that he had been}} badly wounded and was bleeding profusely. Kennan quickly retrieved an abandoned horse he had seen; he helped Madison astride the horse, and they both escaped.|$|E
5|$|Neoclassicism which {{relied on}} {{inspiration}} from ancient Greece and Rome, {{was brought to}} Denmark by the French architect Nicolas-Henri Jardin. His countryman, the sculptor Jacques Saly, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> well established in Denmark, persuaded Frederick V that Jardin could complete Frederik's Church after Eigtved's death. Although Jardin {{did not succeed in}} this, he was successful in designing several prestige Neoclassical buildings such as Bernstorff Palace (1759–65) in Gentofte and Marienlyst Palace near Helsingør.|$|E

5|$|Angelina was {{introduced}} as Angelo's daughter {{who had a}} {{dream of becoming a}} successful recording artist.

Angelina developed a crush on Gloria's son, Kevin Fisher, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> engaged to his girlfriend Chloe. Angelina attempted to seduce Kevin, making Chloe hate her. Angelo put Kevin in charge of keeping Angelina safe from her dangerous ex-boyfriend Carmine Basco (Marco Dapper). Devon found out that Angelina sang well only if staring into Kevin's eyes. At Kevin and Chloe's wedding, Angelina told Kevin that she was pregnant with Carmine's child and that they needed to leave town immediately. Kevin ran away with her after shots were fired during the wedding ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Christopher Eccleston was {{the only}} one of the four lead actors <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> an {{established}} television face, having previously co-starred in the ITV crime drama series Cracker. Eccleston first heard about the project while working with Danny Boyle on the film Shallow Grave in the autumn of 1993. Initially, Eccleston had been considered by the production team as a candidate to play Geordie, but he was more interested in playing Nicky, who he saw as a more emotionally complex character. Eccleston was particularly concerned about being able to successfully perform with the Newcastle Geordie accent. He did not even attempt the accent at his audition, concentrating instead on characterisation. He drew inspiration for his performance as the older Nicky from Peter Flannery himself, basing aspects of his characterisation on Flannery's personality. He even wore some of the writer's own colourful shirts.|$|E
