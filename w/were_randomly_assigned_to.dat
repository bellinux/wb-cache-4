5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} and other executive function skills {{are crucial to}} success both in classroom settings and life. A study examining the impact of cognitive intervention for at-risk children in preschool classrooms found that children who received such intervention for {{one to two years}} significantly outperformed their peers. Compared to same-age children who <b>were</b> <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> the control condition (a literacy unit developed by the school district), preschoolers who received intervention achieved accuracy scores of 85% on tests of inhibitory control (self-discipline), cognitive flexibility, and working memory. Their peers in the control (no intervention) condition, on the other hand, demonstrated only 65% accuracy. Educators involved in this study ultimately opted to implement the cognitive skills training techniques instead of the district-developed curriculum.|$|E
25|$|A {{sample of}} 240 {{undergraduate}} business students was randomly split into forty teams (half {{of the teams}} were 4-person and half 8-person) which <b>were</b> <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> either a collocated or distributed setting. The participants were to complete a task that asked them {{to act as a}} board of directors of a winery with an image problem. They were to find and discuss alternatives, and at the end submit their alternative with rationale. Collocated groups worked at a table together, while distributed groups did the same task at separate computers that allowed for electronic, networked communication. The same technology was used by both collocated and distributed groups.|$|E
25|$|Some {{species have}} a sperm {{transplant}} mechanism. Crickets are one such species that can prematurely remove spermatophore after copulation, which terminates sperm transfer. In one study, males <b>were</b> <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> females to create half-sib families {{to determine the}} heritability of spermatophore retention time in females. The researchers {{found that there was}} additive genetic variance in the timing of spermatophore removal by females. These results suggest that the timing of the spermatophore removal is determined partly by genotype and is independent of the quality of a female's mate. This shows no difference between the fitness of females who freely remove the spermatophore and the fitness of females that are forced to accept complete ejaculates.|$|E

500|$|A {{hypothetical}} randomly evolved {{genetic code}} further motivates a biochemical or evolutionary model for its origin. If amino acids <b>were</b> <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> triplet codons, {{there would be}} 1.5×1084 possible genetic codes. This number is found by calculating the number of ways that [...] 21 items (20 amino acids plus one stop) can be placed in 64 bins, wherein each item is used at least once. However, the distribution of codon assignments in the genetic code is nonrandom. In particular, the genetic code clusters certain amino acid assignments.|$|E
500|$|There is {{a common}} notion that sugar leads to hyperactivity, in {{particular}} in children, but studies and meta-studies question or address this issue. Some articles and studies do refer to the increasing evidence supporting the links between refined sugar and hyperactivity. The WHO FAO meta-study suggests that such inconclusive results {{are to be expected}} when some studies do not effectively segregate or control for free sugars as opposed to sugars still in their natural form (entirely unrefined) while others do. One study followed thirty-five 5-to-7-year-old boys who were reported by their mothers to be behaviorally [...] "sugar-sensitive." [...] They <b>were</b> <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> experimental and control groups. In the experimental group, mothers were told that their children were fed sugar, and, in the control group, mothers were told that their children received a placebo. In fact, all children received the placebo, but mothers in the sugar expectancy condition rated their children as significantly more hyperactive. This result suggests that the real effect of sugar is that it increases worrying among parents with preconceived notions.|$|E
2500|$|A {{strategy}} that groups students of varied ability, preparedness, or accomplishment {{in a single}} classroom environment. Usually this terminology is applied to groupings of students in a particular grade, especially in elementary school. For example, students in fifth grade would be heterogeneously grouped in math if they <b>were</b> <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> classes instead of being grouped by demonstrated subject mastery. [...] Heterogeneous grouping is sometimes claimed {{to provide a more}} effective instructional environment for less prepared students.|$|E

A crossover clinical trial is a repeated-measures design in which each patient <b>is</b> <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> a sequence of treatments, including at least two treatments (of which one may be a standard treatment or a placebo): Thus each patient crosses over from one treatment to another.|$|R

50|$|A double-blind, phase 3 {{clinical}} trial in 753 patients with hyperkalemia and underlying chronic kidney disease, diabetes, congestive heart failure, and in patients on renin-angiotensin system blockers compared ZS-9 with placebo.
