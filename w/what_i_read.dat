500|$|At {{the time}} the Watergate scandal broke to the media, Nixon [...] "barely noticed" [...] the reports of a {{break-in}} at the Democratic National Committee headquarters. Later, when asked by the press about Watergate, she replied curtly, [...] "I know only <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> in the newspapers." [...] In 1974, when a reporter asked [...] "Is the press {{the cause of the}} president's problems?", she shot back, [...] "What problems?" [...] Privately, she felt that the power of her husband's staff was increasing, and President Nixon was becoming more removed from what was occurring in the administration.|$|E
500|$|Synge {{joined the}} Dublin Naturalists' Field Club {{and read the}} works of Charles Darwin. He wrote: [...] "When I was about {{fourteen}} I obtained a book of Darwin's.... My studies showed me the force of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>read,</b> [...] the more I put it from me the more it rushed back with new instances and power... Soon afterwards I turned my attention to works of Christian evidence, reading them at first with pleasure, soon with doubt, and at last in some cases with derision." [...] He then continued, [...] "Soon after I had relinquished the kingdom of God I began {{to take up a}} real interest in the kingdom of Ireland. My politics went round... to a temperate Nationalism." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Concentrate and Ask Again" [...] {{featured}} {{guest star}} Omid Abtahi as telepathic Simon Phillips, his only {{credit for the}} series. Guest actor Kevin Corrigan returned as recurring character Sam Weiss. The episode featured guest stars Jody Thompson and Paul Jarrett as the new characters Sara Downey and Warren Blake, respectively. Thompson called the part [...] "the kind of role that actors dream of". She described the episode, [...] "The material was so compelling and perfectly written {{it was a matter}} of not getting in the way of what the creators had created. I’m anxious about how it will come off. Truthfully, I’ve been torturing myself, wondering if I have somehow ruined the beauty of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> in the script".|$|E

500|$|Discussing his onscreen {{relationship}} with Yang, McKidd said: [...] "It's {{not going to}} be easy for them. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> when I read the season premiere, and this is just my take on it, is that it was very much two very analytical people, Owen and Cristina. They're very similar in a way, I think, as people. Two analytical people see each other over a crowded ER room and their eyes meet." [...] On the topic of Yang's triumphs and challenges in the eighth season, Oh said: [...] "It has been an extremely challenging year that has had a lot of ups and downs, both challenging and exhilarating. We would shoot all our scenes for a day or two straight, and that was extremely challenging because emotionally and physically it becomes really exhausting." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1915, Rogers {{began to appear in}} Florenz Ziegfeld's Midnight Frolic. The variety revue began at midnight in the top-floor night club of Ziegfeld's New Amsterdam Theatre, and drew many influential—and regular—customers. By this time, Rogers had refined his act. His monologues on {{the news of the day}} {{followed}} a similar routine every night. He appeared on stage in his cowboy outfit, nonchalantly twirling his lasso, and said, [...] "Well, what shall I talk about? I ain't got anything funny to say. All I know is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> in the papers." [...] He would make jokes about what he had read in that day's newspapers. The line [...] "All I know is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> in the papers" [...] is often incorrectly described as Rogers's most famous punch line, when it was his opening line.|$|E
2500|$|Bill Donohue of the Catholic League {{took a more}} {{sympathetic}} tack regarding the issue: [...] "It’s time for everyone {{to take a deep}} breath," [...] he commented. [...] "I have never met President Gee, but it is clear from <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> that what he said was made in jest. Was it dumb? ... yes. But context and tone matter, as does the frequency of what may be considered an offensive remark: a real bigot is someone who repeatedly, and maliciously, attacks others. Gee is not such a man. Political correctness has gone too far." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an interview, Jim Parsons {{noted the}} writers' response, but added that, in his opinion, Sheldon [...] "couldn't display more traits" [...] of Asperger's. Parsons, who plays Sheldon, has read John Elder Robison's memoir Look Me in the Eye {{about his life}} with Asperger syndrome, and said that: [...] "A {{majority}} of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> in that book touched on aspects of Sheldon". He also stated that [...] "the way [...] brain works, it's so focused on the intellectual topics at hand that thinking he's autistic is an easy leap for people watching the show to make".|$|E
2500|$|According to Cimino, {{he would}} call Washburn while on the road {{scouting}} for locations and feed him notes on dialogue and story. Upon reviewing Washburn's draft, Cimino said, [...] "I came back, and read it and I just could not believe <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>read.</b> It was like {{it was written by}} somebody who was... mentally deranged." [...] Cimino confronted Washburn at the Sunset Marquis in LA about the draft, and Washburn supposedly replied that he couldn't take the pressure and had to go home. Cimino then fired Washburn. Cimino later claimed to have written the entire screenplay himself. Washburn's response to Cimino's comments were, [...] "It's all nonsense. It's lies. I didn't have a single drink the entire time I was working on the script." ...|$|E
2500|$|In contrast, Hotchner {{has said}} that he {{received}} a near final draft of A Moveable Feast in 1959, and that the version Mary Hemingway published is essentially the draft he had read then. In his view, the original 1964 publication is the version that Hemingway intended, and Mary Hemingway did not revise or add chapters on her own initiative, but simply carried out Ernest's intentions. Hotchner describes Hemingway's memoir as [...] "a serious work", that Hemingway [...] "certainly intended it for publication", and contends: [...] "Because Mary was busy with matters relating to Ernest’s estate, she had little involvement with the book.... <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> on the plane coming back from Cuba [...] was essentially what was published. There was no extra chapter created by Mary.|$|E

[...] "But now, instead of finding out <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have <b>read,</b> or <b>what</b> <b>I</b> like, why not tell me <b>what</b> <b>I</b> ought to <b>read</b> and to like? I think I have seen a vast deal of advice to girls about their reading: why shouldn't the girls turn the tables and advise their elders? I often feel the need of advice from girls on all sorts of subjects, and you would find me very grateful, I believe." ...|$|R
2500|$|Early in the 2012 presidential campaign, in June 2011, Romney said, [...] "I don't {{speak for}} the {{scientific}} community, of course, but I believe the world's getting warmer. I can't prove that, but I believe based on <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> {{that the world is}} getting warmer. And number two, I believe that humans contribute to that. I don't know how much our contribution is to that, because I know that there have been periods of greater heat and warmth in the past but I believe we contribute to that. And so I think it's important for us to reduce our emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases that may well be significant contributors to the climate change and the global warming that you're seeing." [...] Four months later, in October 2011, he said, [...] "My view is that we don't know what's causing climate change on this planet. And the idea of spending trillions and trillions of dollars to try to reduce CO2 emissions is not the right course for us." [...] He expressed his opposition to cap and trade plans and to regulation of carbon emissions. In June 2012, Romney's domestic policy advisor Oren Cass told the Los Angeles Times, [...] "He's a supporter of renewable energy, as long as it's anything that would be economically competitive. He doesn't know the extent to which climate change is occurring or that human activity is causing it.... What you won't see are mandates or taxes or regulations that interfere with economic activity." ...|$|E
