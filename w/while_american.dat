British Airways {{said that it was}} attempting to persuade JAL to remain part of Oneworld rather than aligning itself with Delta and SkyTeam, <b>while</b> <b>American</b> CEO Gerard Arpey said that American and Oneworld remained committed to a partnership with Japan Airlines, as long as it remained a major international carrier, and reiterated his encouragement for JAL to stay with Oneworld during ceremonies to welcome Mexicana into the alliance.|$|E
5|$|Bond is recaptured {{after hearing}} {{the details of the}} operation, but he {{subsequently}} seduces Pussy Galore, Goldfinger's private pilot and convinces her to inform the American authorities. Goldfinger's private army break into Fort Knox and access the vault, where Bond fights and kills Oddjob, <b>while</b> <b>American</b> troops battle with Goldfinger's army outside. Bond's plane is hijacked by Goldfinger, but Bond struggles with him, and shoots out a window, creating an explosive decompression, killing Goldfinger.|$|E

50|$|Behind the scenes, Noor's {{involvement}} in politics was sometimes criticized by fundamentalists. In 1984, she supported her husband when he criticized the Americans for their one-sided commitment to Israel, <b>while</b> <b>Americans</b> criticized her for {{siding with the}} Jordanians.|$|R
5|$|Novlene Williams {{participated in}} the second heat of the August 17 {{semifinal}} round, competing against seven other athletes. She placed third in the heat {{with a time of}} 51.06seconds, displacing Bahamian sprinter Christine Amertil (51.51seconds). However, Russia's Anastasia Kapachinskaya ranked second, ahead of Williams (50.30seconds), <b>while</b> <b>American</b> runner Sanya Richards took first (49.90seconds). Of the 24 athletes who progressed to the semifinal round, Novlene Williams ranked 12th. She was the only Jamaican in the event who did not reach the finals.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{consisted}} of American air raids against Japanese military installations on Formosa (Taiwan) {{during the day}} and Japanese air attacks at night against American ships. Japanese losses exceeded 300 planes destroyed in the air, <b>while</b> <b>American</b> losses amounted to fewer than 100 aircraft destroyed and two cruisers damaged. This outcome effectively deprived the Japanese Navy's Combined Fleet of air cover for future operations, which proved decisive during the Battle of Leyte Gulf later in October.|$|E
5|$|Australia, {{along with}} New Zealand, were widely {{recognized}} as the strongest teams in the Oceanian zone. They were the only teams to have won the OFC Nations Cup, and {{the only ones to}} have qualified for the World Cup: Australia had qualified in 1974 and New Zealand in 1982. American Samoa were one of the weakest teams in the world, having lost all of their official international matches since they had joined FIFA in 1998. Prior to the match, Australia was ranked 75th in the FIFA World Rankings, <b>while</b> <b>American</b> Samoa was ranked 203rd, the lowest of all FIFA members.|$|E
50|$|<b>While</b> <b>Americans</b> {{were largely}} {{responsible}} for making summer the high season, a French fashion designer, Coco Chanel, made sunbathing fashionable. She acquired a striking tan {{during the summer of}} 1923, and tans then became the fashion in Paris.|$|R
50|$|Canadian readers tend {{to think}} of Newford as an <b>American</b> city, <b>while</b> <b>Americans</b> usually think of it as Canadian, as it {{incorporates}} elements of both. However, de Lint has stated that he chose to definitively give it the American legal system.|$|R
25|$|<b>While</b> <b>Americans</b> {{turned to}} the new imports in {{increasing}} numbers, AMC continued its struggle at the inefficient and aging Kenosha, Wisconsin facilities—the oldest continuously operating automobile plant in the world, where components and unfinished bodies still had to be transported across the city.|$|R
5|$|Development {{flying and}} route proving with the Comet 3 allowed {{accelerated}} certification {{of what was}} destined to be the most successful variant of the type, the Comet 4. All airline customers for the Comet 3 subsequently cancelled their orders and switched to the Comet 4, which was based on the Comet 3 but with improved fuel capacity. BOAC ordered 19 Comet 4s in March 1955, <b>while</b> <b>American</b> operator Capital Airlines ordered 14 Comets in July 1956. Capital's order included 10 Comet 4As, a variant modified for short-range operations with a stretched fuselage and short wings, lacking the pinion (outboard wing) fuel tanks of the Comet 4. However, because of financial problems and a subsequent takeover by United Airlines, Capital would never operate the Comet.|$|E
5|$|Foreign operas {{were popular}} among the upper-class {{throughout}} the 19th century, while other styles of musical theater included operettas, ballad operas and the opera bouffe. The English operettas of Gilbert and Sullivan were particularly popular, <b>while</b> <b>American</b> compositions had trouble finding an audience. George M. Cohan {{was the first}} notable American composer of musical theater, {{and the first to}} move away from the operetta, and is also notable for using the language of the vernacular in his work. By the beginning of the 20th century, however, black playwrights, composers and musicians were having a profound effect on musical theater, beginning with the works of Will Marion Cook, James Reese Europe and James P. Johnson; the first major hit black musical was Shuffle Along in 1921.|$|E
5|$|Primarily {{the brainchild}} of General Nguyen Chi Thanh, the {{upcoming}} offensive would be timed to provoke a popular general uprising among the South Vietnamese people against the government and its American supporters. Yet prudence required that the South Vietnamese maintain 50 per cent of their forces on standby, <b>while</b> <b>American</b> and allied forces under General William Westmoreland—the Free World Military Forces—remained on full alert. However, despite such measures the fighting at Khe Sanh had largely succeeded in diverting American resources and attention away from Saigon and towards the demilitarized zone, affording the communists the element of surprise.|$|E
50|$|Changes for 1964 {{included}} a new grille, larger rear window and small tailfins giving the car a boxier look from the side. Canadians {{were given the}} choice of a new two-door hardtop, <b>while</b> <b>Americans</b> got the Salon option on the four-door hardtop and post.|$|R
50|$|Often European {{management}} is contrasted to the American or Japanese management culture. <b>While</b> <b>Americans</b> pursue risk more easily, Europeans rather pursue stability leading to less opportunities with fewer financial rewards.

5000|$|The Committee of 100 also visited Secretary Dean Rusk at the State Department {{to demand}} {{enforcement}} of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, limitations on immigration <b>while</b> <b>Americans</b> still lacked jobs, and cessation of diplomatic relations with South Africa and Portugal because of their governments' racist policies.|$|R
5|$|Simpson {{participated in}} the first heat of the August 17 semifinals, which also {{included}} eight athletes. She placed fourth after finishing the race in 11.11seconds. The Bahamas' Sturrup placed behind her (11.22seconds), while the United States' Lauryn Williams placed ahead (11.10seconds). Overall, of the 16 semifinalists, Simpson placed fifth; she placed lower than the other Jamaican athletes in the event during this round, but progressed to the finals. While at the final round, Simpson tied Kerron Stewart for second place, taking the silver medal alongside her {{with a time of}} 10.98seconds. Shelly-Ann Frazer of Jamaica ranked ahead {{of the two of them}} for the gold medal (10.78seconds), <b>while</b> <b>American</b> sprinter Williams ranked behind them (11.03seconds).|$|E
5|$|The Americans, however, had no {{intentions}} {{of letting the}} British Band escape. The Warrior, a steamboat outfitted with an artillery piece, patrolled the Mississippi River, <b>while</b> <b>American</b> allied-Dakotas, Menominees, and Ho-Chunks watched the banks. On August 1, the Warrior arrived {{at the mouth of}} the Bad Axe River, where the Dakotas told the Americans that they would find Black Hawk's people. Black Hawk raised a white flag in an attempt to surrender, but his intentions may have been garbled in translation. The Americans, in no mood to accept a surrender anyway, thought that the Indians were using the white flag to set an ambush. When they became certain that the Natives on land were the British Band, they opened fire. Twenty-three Natives were killed in the exchange of gunfire, while just one soldier on the Warrior was injured.|$|E
5|$|West Gates engines {{were shut}} down <b>while</b> <b>American</b> {{backed out of the}} tangle. West Gate quickly began to settle and the order to abandon ship was issued. The chief {{engineer}} and his assistant, Spencer and Hillery, remained belowdecks long enough to extinguish the boilers and open safety valves to prevent the explosion of the boilers. They finished the task just before the aft bulkhead gave way to the inrushing seawater. Both arrived on deck in time to board lifeboat number 2, which had been held as long as possible for men in the after part of the ship.|$|E
5000|$|The American pair {{defeated}} their Japanese {{rivals in}} the first semi-final, while the Australians beat the Italians in the other.

25|$|European AI {{researchers}} favored Prolog <b>while</b> <b>Americans</b> favored Lisp, reportedly causing many nationalistic {{debates on}} the merits of the languages. Much of the modern development of Prolog came from the impetus of the Fifth Generation Computer Systems project (FGCS), which developed a variant of Prolog named Kernel Language for its first operating system.|$|R
50|$|The {{third day}} of {{competition}} began with the pairs' free skating.

5|$|<b>While</b> <b>American</b> economists quickly {{abandoned}} disequilibrium models, European economists {{were more}} open to models without market clearing. Europeans such as Edmond Malinvaud and Jacques Drèze expanded on the disequilibrium tradition and worked to explain price rigidity instead of simply assuming it. Malinvaud (1977) used disequilibrium analysis to develop a theory of unemployment. He argued that disequilibrium in the labor and goods markets could lead to rationing of goods and labor, leading to unemployment. Malinvaud adopted a fixprice framework and argued that pricing would be rigid in modern, industrial prices compared to the relatively flexible pricing systems of raw goods that dominate agricultural economies. Prices are fixed and only quantities adjust. Malinvaud considers an equilibrium state in classical and Keynesian unemployment as most likely. Work in the neoclassical tradition is confined as a special case of Malinvaud's typology, the Walrasian equilibrium. In Malinvaud's theory, reaching the Walrasian equilibrium case {{is almost impossible to}} achieve given the nature of industrial pricing.|$|E
5|$|With {{the partial}} {{destruction}} of the North Vietnamese logistical system in Cambodia, the U.S. headquarters in Saigon determined that the time was propitious for a similar campaign in Laos. If such an operation were to be carried out, the U.S. command believed, {{it would be best}} to do it quickly, <b>while</b> <b>American</b> military assets were still available in South Vietnam. Such an operation would create supply shortages that would be felt by PAVN/NLF forces 12–18 months later, as the last U.S. troops were leaving South Vietnam and thereby give the U.S. and its ally a respite from a possible communist offensive in the northern provinces for one year, possibly even two.|$|E
5|$|At 08:20 on {{the morning}} of 25 July the Chinese again {{assaulted}} the US Marines on Hill 119 in company strength but were soon halted by American artillery and mortar fire which inflicted heavy losses; skirmishing continued {{for the remainder of the}} day. While no major assaults against Hill 111 occurred, a heavy barrage by the Chinese targeted the position at 11:00. F9F Panthers provided air support to the Marines throughout the day, <b>while</b> <b>American</b> tanks continued to engage Chinese targets in support of the defenders on Hill 111 and Boulder City. Finally, at 13:35 the last of the Chinese infantry were forced off the forward slopes of Boulder City by the US Marines. Chinese casualties were estimated by the Americans to have included another 75 killed and 425 wounded. The Chinese continued to heavily shell the American positions, and by late afternoon 13,500 mortar and artillery rounds had fallen on the sector held by US 7th Marine Regiment. The Americans fired many counter-battery missions in response, firing 36,794 rounds. The ongoing relief of the US 7th Marine Regiment continued throughout the day. Meanwhile, the Australian positions on The Hook were also heavily shelled throughout the day, forcing many of the defenders underground into the network of tunnels then being extended by a team of New Zealand sappers.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, on 27 October the Middlesex {{continued}} the brigade's advance, and {{was involved in}} a sharp fight in the hills west of the river near the village of Yongsong-ni, killing 35 North Koreans and capturing 80 prisoners, <b>while</b> <b>American</b> aircraft destroyed 10 North Korean T-34 tanks and two SU-76 self-propelled guns. The following day the Argylls took over as the lead battalion. Intelligence indicated that the British and Australians were facing the North Korean 17th Tank Brigade, equipped with 20 tanks, and although the North Koreans had suffered heavy casualties during the previous fighting on the Taeryong River, Coad was now forced to adopt more cautious tactics as a result, advancing in shorter bounds and clearing high points en route. With the war considered all but over the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade continued to pursue the North Koreans towards Chongju over the next three days; however, the advance increasingly encountered strong resistance from North Korean infantry dug-in with tanks and self-propelled guns in support as they approached the Yalu River on the Manchurian border.|$|E
