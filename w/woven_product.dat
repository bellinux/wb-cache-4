Various scientists suggest {{a variety of}} methods and technologies of manufacture of blood vessels prostheses. Recently innovative designs of woven implants are actively being developed. The purpose of this scientific work is analyzing all features of the last major innovations in the woven vascular graft design and manufacture of elastic bifurcated tubular implants. Therefore, this study briefly describes the main materials, types and methods of manufacturing vascular prostheses. Practical target is desing of new options of elastic structure of tubular implant and manufacturing of new woven bifurcated tubular vascular implant to ensure the best incorporation of the synthetic implant into total vascular system of the body. Vascular implant is manufactured by woven method as a hollow tube consisting of a main tube and the two branches. This product is manufactured using a special weave. In the process of weaving were used polyester and polyurethane yarns. Innovative <b>woven</b> <b>product</b> has the exellent biomechanical properties: circumferentially and longitudial elastic deformation, modulus of elasticity, tensile strength, no water permeability. In previous studies different solutions were used for implant impregnation and various viscosity and structure were trying to to improve water resistance of impregnated <b>woven</b> <b>product.</b> This woven bifurcated elastic vascular implant was impregnated with a solution of biologically active agents. Additional processing provides zero water permeability of the wall. Elastic membrane was formed on the porous wall of the implant and in the space between the fibers. As a result woven frame and special impregnation created a composite matrix. Such processing of implant also provides better biocompatibility with natural body tissues and the successful integration into blood-vascular system. Natural biological tissues grow into the walls of the implant. Neointima is formed on the inner wall into the lumen of the implant. New design and structure of woven elastic bifurcated implant provides the normal long-term process of hemodynamics. A positive result was confirmed by histological tests...|$|E

Phenomenon of an object does not automatically represents what it looks. To have an appropriate image of an aesthetic object, contemplation, and interpretation of the essence are required. The traditional Balinese <b>woven</b> <b>product</b> has inspired us to have ideas on philosophical values of life. Interrelated vertical and horizontal lines represents the Balinese life concept of “Tri Hita Karana”, meaning a balance between spiritual and material life. This represents a balanced relationship between humans and God, among humans, and between humans and natural environment. The heteroginity of social life keeps moving in space and time that horizontal conflict occur. There are different ideologies, races, languages, cultures, and interests. When understood with extreme fanatism and when individual or group interests supersede public interests, conflicts in social life will occur. Diversity should be understood as potential strength when it is managed wisely and harmoniously to have a mutual understanding, mutual respect and harmonious diversity. Diversity as a concept of life is manifested in a visual language of painting. The complexity of conceptual expression as the interpretation of the phenomena of life is then translated into personal symbols on media. The basic elements of visual arts such as lines, shapes, dots, colors, are processed in such an aesthetic way to have comprehensive. Art of artistict and aesthetic painting...|$|E

40|$|This master's project {{guides the}} {{revitalisation}} of the Wool Equities' weaving mill in Palmerston North {{through the use}} of innovative, creative and industry-led design. It begins with research into the current state of New Zealand's wool industry, value chains, vertical markets and export potential for high quality, luxury woollen products. Global trend research and identification of luxury niche markets provide the international context for the design work. These establish areas of demand for original products that are able to be manufactured viably at the mill, both for interior and apparel fabric exports. Fusion of old and new technologies along with the properties and behaviour of wool go hand-in-hand with weaving knowledge and technical design to form the constructive design basis of this project. Historical and heritage aesthetics are explored through drawings and colour studies at the mill. Motifs are translated into weaving patterns to create unique and original textile pieces that are both contemporary and authentic, with a story behind the design. The project takes an immersive, hands-on approach to learning all the operations at the mill and extending my own knowledge of weaving processes; adapting small-scale samples to commercially viable fabric. The outcome of this project is a range of luxury woollen <b>woven</b> <b>product</b> designs that can be sold to both local and international markets. This will offer long-term commercial opportunities for the mill and promote further development of the business. It will highlight the mill's capabilities to function as a specialty New Zealand weaving company and create innovative new designs.

The main task {{of this study is to}} create new design options for elastic structure of woven hollow tube and to produce vascular implants to ensure the best incorporation of the synthetic implant into total vascular system of the body. Structure of these implants composed of several type textile filaments and special composition of impregnated biomaterials. Implant is manufactured by woven method as a woven hollow tube using special weaves. In the process of weaving were used polyester and polyurethane yarns. Innovative <b>woven</b> <b>product</b> has the necessary biomechanical properties: tensile strength; circumferentially and longitudial elastic deformation; modulus of elasticity. This woven tube is further processed, including impregnation with a solution of biologically compounds.

Natural elastic membrane was formed on the porous wall of the implant and in the space between the fibers. As a result woven frame and special impregnation created a composite matrix. Such impregnation ensures zero hydro permeability of the wall of the woven prosthesis. This factor is especially important during the first hours and days after implantation. In such circumstances, the blood does not leak through the wall and significantly reduces the risk of hemorrhage. Such impregnation of implant also provides better biocompatibility with natural body tissues and the successful integration into the vascular circulatory system.

40|$|A {{laboratory}} test program {{was conducted to}} determine the moisture-suction relationships of geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs). Moisture-suction relationships were determined by combining suction data from pressure plate tests, contact filter paper tests, and relative humidity tests, then fitting water retention curves (WRCs) to the data. WRCs were determined for wetting processes and drying processes in terms of gravimetric moisture content and volumetric moisture content. The effects of GCL type, hydration solution, wet-dry cycles, and temperature on the moisture-suction relationships were analyzed. The three GCLs of the test program consisted of configurations of woven and nonwoven geotextiles reinforced with needlepunched fibers. A geofilm was adhesively bonded to the nonwoven side {{of one of the}} GCL products. The hydration solution tests involved hydrating GCLs with deionized water, tap water, 0. 1 M CaCl 2, or soil water from a landfill cover test plot for a 30 -day conditioning period prior to testing. Cyclic wet-dry tests were conducted on the GCL specimens subjected to 20 wet-dry cycles from 50 % to 0 % gravimetric moisture content prior to testing. Temperature tests were conducted at 2 °C, 20 °C, and 40 °C. GCL type affected moisture-suction relationships. The GCLs with an adhesively-bonded geofilm exhibited lower air-entry suction and higher residual suction than GCLs without a geofilm. The degree of needlepunched fiber pullout during hydration contributed to hysteresis between wetting WRCs and drying WRCs. Hysteresis was high for suction values below air-entry suction and was low for suction values greater than air-entry suction. Cation exchange reduced the water retention capacity for all three GCL types. The saturated gravimetric moisture contents were reduced from approximately 140 % to 70 % for wetting WRCs and 210 % to 90 % for drying WRCs for GCLs hydrated in deionized water compared to CaCl 2 solution. Hysteresis of the nonwoven product decreased from 71 %, to 62 %, to 28 % with respect to deionized water, tap water, and CaCl 2 solution. Hysteresis of the <b>woven</b> <b>product</b> exposed to soil water was 24 % and 0 %, in terms of saturated gravimetric moisture content and saturated volumetric moisture content, respectively. The swell index, Atterberg Limits, mole fraction of bound sodium, and scanning electron microscopy images that were determined of bentonite from the conditioned GCLs indicated that changes in water retention capacity corresponded with cation exchange. Wet-dry cycles and temperature affected the moisture-suction behavior for GCLs. Wet-dry cycles reduced hysteresis and increased the swelling capacity of GCL specimens. Microscopy images indicated that wet-dry cycles caused weak orientation of the clay particles. Increasing temperature resulted in a small decrease in water retention capacity. Results of the test program provided a means for predicting unsaturated behavior for GCLs...|$|E
