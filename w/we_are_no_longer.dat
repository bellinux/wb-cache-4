At the same time, he lamented what he {{perceived}} as poor treatment of the state as disloyal by the Federal government. He cited examples such as the declaration of martial law in the Commonwealth and the suspension {{of the right of}} habeas corpus for its citizens. He answered President Lincoln's contention [...] "that military necessity is not to be measured by Constitutional limits" [...] by warning [...] "If military necessity is not to be measured by Constitutional limits, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> a free people." ...|$|E
500|$|During the 1890s, Walker became {{active in}} politics. [...] Walker's {{activism}} was heightened by {{an incident in}} June 1897 in which residents of Urbana, Ohio, formed a lynch mob, removed a black man named [...] "Click" [...] Mitchell from the town jail, and publicly killed him by hanging. [...] Believing that Ohio's Republican Governor Asa Bushnell had failed to conduct an appropriate investigation into the lynching, Walker and other African Americans in Ohio left the Republican Party and formed the Negro Protective Party. [...] As {{a member of the}} party's Executive Committee, Walker helped organize the party's convention at Columbus, Ohio in September 1897. [...] The party adopted a platform demanding [...] "an immediate recognition of our rights as citizens such as have been repeatedly pledged and as often violated," [...] and declaring an intention [...] "to take immediate political action that we may show to the world that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> the plaything of politicians or chattels for sale to the highest bidder." [...] The party also began publishing [...] "The Negro Protector" [...] as its official organ. [...] When former slave and Republican Party official, Nelson T. Gant, attacked Walker and the Negro Protective Party, Walker responded with an open letter that was published in Ohio newspapers. [...] In the letter, Walker wrote:Notwithstanding N. T. Gant there are many [...] "intelligent Negroes" [...] who will support the Negro protective ticket and will hurl back at him with contempt his insults to their manhood that they are not free to leave the republican party without being branded as [...] "betrayers of their party" [...] and [...] "ungrateful to their Creator and their race." [...] Such fumings are manifestly the strongest evidence of an enslaved mind... Republicans... believe, or make pretense of believing, that the Negro owes eternal allegiance to the G. O. P. no matter what the issue... We shall not trespass further upon your valuable space, except to say that the Negro Protective party will live and its supporters hope never to regret the stand taken for free and independent manhood as a protest against every disregard, from whatever source, of the rights and privileges of the Negro as an American citizen.|$|E

We have feared this. The day before in Barcelona and now in Turku. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> an island". He added: [...] "This act was cowardly and reprehensible. The killing of innocent people is a violation of humanity and of religions' principles. We are however all in the same boat and we must defend humanity so that hate is not answered with hate." ...|$|E

2500|$|Einstein {{proposed}} that spacetime is curved by matter, and that free-falling objects are moving along locally straight paths in curved spacetime. These straight paths are called geodesics. Like Newton's first law of motion, Einstein's theory states {{that if a}} force is applied on an object, it would deviate from a geodesic. [...] For instance, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> following geodesics while standing because the mechanical resistance of the Earth exerts an upward force on us, and we are non-inertial {{on the ground as}} a result. This explains why moving along the geodesics in spacetime is considered inertial.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2014, The Walrus was {{required}} to shut down its unpaid internship programme after the Ontario Ministry of Labour declared that its longstanding practice of not paying interns was in contravention of the Employment Standards Act. The magazine issued a statement justifying its practice of using unpaid labour, saying [...] "We have been training future leaders in media and development for ten years, and we are extremely sorry <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> able to provide these opportunities, which have assisted many young Ontarians—and Canadians—in bridging the gap from university to paid work and in, many cases, on to stellar careers." ...|$|E

On July 27, 2006, {{three years to}} the day of them meeting on a blind date, they were married in Virginia. The footage was taped and later aired on national television. Busch announced on June 30, 2011, [...] "Those in the NASCAR community have been aware for some time now that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> together and we are legally separated".

[...] He said that Catholics accounted for 17.4 percent of the world population—a stable percentage—while Muslims were at 19.2 percent. [...] "It is true that while Muslim families, as is well known, continue to make a lot of children, Christian ones on the contrary tend to have fewer and fewer," [...] the monsignor said. Muslims in 2010 represented as much as 23.4% of the total world population and this is expected to increase to 26.3% by 2030.|$|E
2500|$|Danish {{parliamentary}} speaker Mogens Lykketoft {{was chosen}} as the consensus candidate of WEOG to preside over the assembly.

He said [...] "Things have changed in the past 15 years. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> just fighting extreme poverty brought about by a lack of public services. We are fighting against a new form of poverty, one caused by the unsustainable path of development that we, as a species, have chosen to embark on. The consensus is {{that it is impossible to}} continue without endangering not just ourselves, but future generations as well." [...] Amongst these goals included the end of year United Nations Climate Change Conference, or COP21.|$|E
2500|$|Originally {{the text}} read that God {{has not made}} us like the nations who [...] "bow down to nothingness and vanity, and pray to an {{impotent}} god." ... In the Middle Ages these words were censored, since the church believed they were an insult to Christianity. Omitting them tends {{to give the impression}} that the Aleinu teaches that we are both different and better than others. The actual intent is to say that we are thankful that God has enlightened us so that, unlike the pagans, we worship the true God and not idols. There is no inherent superiority in being Jewish, but we do assert the superiority of monotheistic belief over paganism. Although paganism still exists today, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> the only ones to have a belief in one God.|$|E

2500|$|Harris {{states that}} {{religion}} contains bad ideas, calling it [...] "one {{of the most}} perverse misuses of intelligence we have ever devised". He compares modern religious beliefs to the myths of the Ancient Greeks, which were once accepted as fact but which are obsolete today. In a January 2007 interview with PBS, Harris said, [...] "We don't have a word for not believing in Zeus, {{which is to say}} we are all atheists in respect to Zeus. And we don't have a word for not being an astrologer." [...] He {{goes on to say that}} the term atheist will be retired only when [...] "we all just achieve a level of intellectual honesty where <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> going to pretend to be certain about things we are not certain about".|$|E
2500|$|Epicurus' {{philosophy}} {{is based on}} the theory that all good and bad derive from the sensations of what he defined as pleasure and pain: What is good is what is pleasurable, and what is bad is what is painful. His ideas of pleasure and pain were ultimately, for Epicurus, the basis for the moral distinction between good and evil. If pain is chosen over pleasure in some cases it is only because it leads to a greater pleasure. Although Epicurus has been commonly misunderstood to advocate the rampant pursuit of pleasure, his teachings were more about striving for an absence of pain and suffering, both physical and mental, and a state of satiation and tranquillity that was free of the fear of death and the retribution of the gods. Epicurus argued that when we do not suffer pain, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> in need of pleasure, and we enter a state of ataraxia, [...] "tranquillity of soul" [...] or [...] "imperturbability".|$|E
2500|$|Wilhelm Pauk {{wrote in}} 1931 (Karl Barth Prophet Of A New Christianity) that Kierkegaard's {{use of the}} Latin phrase Finitum Non Capax Infiniti (the finite does not (or cannot) {{comprehend}} the infinite) summed up Barth's system. David G. Kingman and Adolph Keller each discussed Barth's relationship to Kierkegaard in their books, The Religious Educational Values in Karl Barth's Teachings (1934) and Karl Barth and Christian Unity (1933). Keller notes the splits that happen when a new teaching is introduced and some assume a higher knowledge from a higher source than others. But Kierkegaard always referred to the equality of all {{in the world of}} the spirit where there is neither [...] "sport" [...] nor [...] "spook" [...] or anyone who can shut you out of the world of the spirit except yourself. All are chosen by God and equal in His sight. The Expectancy of Faith," [...] Before this faith came, we were held prisoners by the law, locked up until faith should be revealed. So the law was put in charge to lead us to Christ that we might be justified by faith. Now that faith has come, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> under the supervision of the law. You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus, for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise. The Bible – NIV" [...] Galatians 3:23–29; [...] "In the world of spirit to become one’s own master, is the highest – and in love to help someone toward that, to become himself, free, independent, his own master, to help him stand alone – that is the greatest beneficence. The greatest beneficence, to help the other to stand alone, cannot be done directly." [...] "If a person always keeps his soul sober and alert in this idea, he will never go astray in his outlook on life and people or [...] "combine respect for status of persons with his faith." [...] Show no partiality as you hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ. (James 2.1) Then he will direct his thoughts toward God, and his eye will not make the mistake of looking for differences in the world instead of likeness with God.|$|E
