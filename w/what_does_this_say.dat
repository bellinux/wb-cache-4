These changes have given Tenzin Gyatso a new authority in the Tibetan community: he is now the unique and unquestioned leader of the Tibetan cause in the world.

40|$|Excerpt] This book {{considers}} what we {{know about}} treatments for back pain and asks a number of critical questions. Are {{some of the most popular}} treatments really effective? Do they “cure” or even improve the problems they claim to address? If some back pain treatments are ineffective or even harmful, why do patients clamor for them and doctors provide them? Who benefits from the vast back pain industry that’s developed over the past thirty years? Is it patients? Or the doctors, hospitals, and man­ufacturers that produce the technology of back pain therapy? <b>What</b> <b>does</b> all <b>this</b> <b>say</b> about our medical system? Or our efforts to enhance quality, improve safety, and reduce health care costs? How can patients maneuver to help themselves rather than help the medical industry? Will efforts to measure patient satisfaction help deliver safer and more effective treatments or encourage the opposite? In answering these questions, <b>this</b> book <b>does</b> more than describe and analyze the back business. It also explores the complex ways that doctors interact with patients, drug companies, and medical device makers. The results can inadvertently lead to treatments that are inef­fective or even harmful...|$|R
40|$|This {{anthology}} utilizes {{the concept}} of encounters to investigate the linked constructions of identity and difference in modern European history. The articles use representations of others to ask basic questions about identity: how is the encountered group described, and <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> description <b>say</b> about the observer and about the cultural group and discourse that the observer represents? The studies span 150 years and a wide geographical area (Germany, the U. S., Sweden and Russia). Importantly, they also demonstrate how descriptions of the “other” {{vary according to the}} media used. The form in which the representation is placed – in novels, travel literature, web sites, newspapers or World Fairs – affects the way in which its messages on identity and otherness are conceptualised and conveyed. These articles, thus, not only present insights into how the discourses of, e. g., race, Orientalism, educational, gender and class hierarchies affect concepts of “us and the others”. They also show how the medium functions {{as an integral part of}} that message. The book is written by a range of authors ranging from advanced students to professors. It is, accordingly, aimed not only at experts in the field, but also those starting out in identity and cultural studies – serving both as a textbook, and as a work for seasoned scholars looking for recent and innovative investigations in the field of identity studies...|$|R
40|$|Why do we {{care about}} {{prestige}} rankings? <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> preoccupation <b>say</b> about our implicit understanding of prestige {{as a function of}} image and identity? For an academic community in which identity matters, prestige rankings reveal an important dimension of identity in community context. In the case of existing rankings for the emergent iSchools, interdisciplinary growth has rendered the community context incomplete. Exploring indicators of prestige in hiring networks as related to the measures of prestige presented in peer rankings such as US News & World Report (USNWR) rankings provides a new perspective on hiring and identity in the iSchools. This research collected data on the educational pedigrees of 693 full-time faculty at iSchools and constructed a hiring network of institutional affiliations, with connections between the schools based on the institutions from which current iSchool faculty received their PhD degrees. The study quantitatively and qualitatively compares the iSchool hiring network structure to a similar hiring network in the more established academic discipline of Computer Science (CS), and uses regression on network prestige and centrality measures to explain the variance in USNWR ratings. The study projects inclusive prestige ratings for the full CS and iSchool communities, which reveal underlying similarities {{in the structure of the}} two networks. Analysis of additional hiring network features, such as faculty areas of study and self-hiring in the iSchools, demonstrates the interdisciplinary diversity of the emergent field of information and its constituent institutions...|$|R

Are the silent designers [2] — the technology and software — growing louder? Are picture marks mimicking each other? Are graphic marks following trendy solutions?

However, what are the consequences of the transformation in the modus operandi and its result in picture marks evolving solutions? And <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> evolution <b>say</b> about us?

40|$|International audienceIn {{classical}} and dialectal Arabic syntax, linguists identify two opposite genders: masculine and feminine. The latter is linguistically {{marked by the}} morpheme a(t) (called fatha) while the former is considered unmarked {{and there is no}} neuter. The morphosyntactical rule of feminine marking seems to be obvious: it consists of adding a feminine inflection. Yet, this morphosyntactic marking does not apply systematically. Some adjectives do not have any feminine inflections despite describing physiological and psychological female phenomena: for instance, hamel ‘pregnant’, taliq ‘repudiated’, thaib ‘widow’, mourdhi ‘breast feeder’, tamich ‘post- menopausal woman’. This chapter addresses the following two questions: Why does the gender marker disappear in such typical cases relating specifically to female biological states?

40|$|It is important, {{if we are}} to {{know each}} other, that you also know my alphabet, because from the moment I hear your name - and ever after - I will {{associate}} you with a colour. Do not be offended; without it I would have bugger all chance of remembering what your name is. And please do not assume the colour of your name is in some way a reflection of your character: it is nothing more than the outcome of a struggle between the letters that make it up, of which the first will almost always win. Like, I have this friend, Colin, and his name is pink. And when I told him this he looked bemused and said, but he hated pink; <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> <b>say</b> about him? And I hid my irritation with a smile and explained it said nothing about him, other than that his name was made up of a combination of letters that when placed in that order looked pink. I said if he was a Graeme, he would be black-blue with green; if he was a Graham, he would be black-blue with brown; but he was a Colin, and so he was pink, and nothing short of a deed poll would change it. Of course not everyone reacts like Colin, stodgy old stick that he is. It would be easier if they did. Once, when I was in Europe, my alphabet became so strong I could not write postcards. Every time I tried, the colours of the words would clash, and I could not go on. And my 1 st boyfriend, who was with me, said I should go with the urge to make the colours match, that by doing so I would be saying what I really wanted to. He was always saying things like that, {{and most of the time}} I ended up believing him. But not even the Ecstasy we were on could convince me he was right that time. It was all I could do not to say: for Christ's sake, the colours are arbitrary! Months later, when I was coming to terms with the end of our relationship, that incident seemed to sum up everything that was wrong with him and me. I almost passed my current lover up because of that. My alphabet was the first thing he knew about me, and the envy with which he spoke of it annoyed me. Then on Valentine's Day he sent me a song, with the lyrics transcribed in my colours, and I began to understand why he wanted to see what I saw. For all the hours he put in, he could not capture how my alphabet looks to me, the endless variation triggered by the arrangement of its letters into words. For the more I look at a word, the more colours I see. In the first instance, I see one. Within half a second, I see other colours come to life, each struggling for recognition.
