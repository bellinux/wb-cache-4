I was in awe of all these great songs he’d written, and he would play them on the {{acoustic}} guitar really hard, Johnny Ramone style, all six strings. He had this bitter resentment that drenched every step he took and every word that he spoke. His songs were just filled with that envy {{of people that are}} better looking, that are more successful. It was just really inspiring to be around someone that just hated everything that much. It was just great.|$|E
25|$|Into the '60s, I {{was still}} not of a frame of mind {{that we were not}} only making music, we were making history. But I did {{recognize}} the impact because acts were going all over the world at that time. I recognized the bridges that we crossed, the racial problems and the barriers that we broke down with music. I recognized that because I lived it. I would come to the South {{in the early days of}} Motown and the audiences would be segregated. Then they started to get the Motown music and <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> back and the audiences were integrated and the kids were dancing together and holding hands.|$|E
25|$|Matt McCoy, {{a senior}} walk-on, {{is a young}} man that has been working for {{the last three or four}} years. We would {{certainly}} not take a redshirt off Sherrod Harris at this point; it would be unfair for him because he has sat this year with the idea that he'll start the spring as a redshirt freshman. And then Mack (Brown) and I will sit down and discuss the possibility of an emergency situation as we've done in the past; one year Tony Jeffrey worked as quarterback for us because he had played quarterback in high school. So we'll sit down and look at some different options as to which way <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>go.</b> It would certainly be somebody that we think can run the offense and have a limited package for those guys. I don't think we'll need an emergency quarterback, but we'll certainly have a third guy ready.|$|E

500|$|Mr. Arakawa and I {{decided that}} <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> down and simply tell him [...] that we've come {{to tell you}} to your face that we would pay you if we thought we were liable, but we had done our {{homework}} and we were not prepared to pay anything because we hadn't done anything wrong. We just wanted to essentially look him in the face and tell him that. It seemed the honorable thing to do.|$|E
500|$|Chuck's {{father and}} co-pilot. Kazinsky stated Martini hated {{the fact that}} he was cast as Chuck's father, being only 13 years Kazinsky's senior. However, Kazinsky said they {{developed}} a bond while filming, [...] "Because we were working so tight together, we would finish and then <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> out for dinner every night and <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> to the gym together on days off we had… The emotional scene toward the end with the father-son parting, it was very easy for me to play because I had grown to actually genuinely love Max as a man and as a friend." [...] Kazinsky revealed that Herc and Chuck's pet bulldog was del Toro's idea and said, [...] "The dog's name was Max, ironically, and we ended up using Max for so many things. The story was that Herc and Chuck have difficulty communicating, that they communicated via the dog, and all the love that they couldn't show each other they would show the dog." [...] The role was originally written for Ron Perlman, but del Toro decided the scenes between Perlman's Herc and Hunnam's Raleigh [...] "might start to feel like Sons of Anarchy 2.0".|$|E
500|$|Faye Marsay, who {{portrayed the}} Waif, spoke about her scenes and filming with Williams, saying, [...] " [...] I {{think we did}} a month in Belfast before we started shooting. We went into the stunt tent and lived there. It was choreographed like a dance. Maisie is so well coordinated and good at what she does. I'm {{a little bit less}} coordinated and easily pissed off. I would drop the stick down and go, [...] "I can't do it!" [...] And she would {{encourage}} me. She's so supportive. We did a month, and then the day before the cameras turned on, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> through the moves a couple of times so we wouldn't hurt each other. There were a few times we clipped each other. I remember getting her in the stomach really bad one time, and she nearly cut my ear off at one point. It was fun. It was a lot of fun, but we were exhausted as well." ...|$|E

500|$|By late August 2015, {{it became}} a strong {{possibility}} that a new NBL Canada team would be created in Halifax for the 2015–16 season. A new ownership group, led by former Rainmen advisor and CEO of Corporate Research Associates in Don Mills, soon confirmed that the defunct team's reincarnation would compete for the next season. Mills expected a group of 25 shareholders to help start up the organization, many of whom personally paid for the Rainmen's flights and hotels in the last season. He chose to not include Levingston in the ownership group but allowed him to assume the position as the team's general manager. Mills said, [...] "There {{would not be a}} new team in Halifax without Andre. We decided that the only way <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> forward to raise the money was if Andre was part of the solution." [...] Despite this, he preferred to break ties with the Rainmen franchise. It was not disclosed who paid for the $250,000 fee required for a team to register in the NBL Canada.|$|E
500|$|Docter {{noted that}} the film {{reflects}} his friendships with Disney veterans Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston, and Joe Grant (who all died before the film's release and thus the film was dedicated to them). Grant gave the script his approval {{as well as some}} advice before his death in 2005. Docter recalled that Grant would remind him that the audience needed an [...] "emotional bedrock" [...] because of how wacky the adventure would become; here it is Carl mourning for his wife. Docter felt that Grant's personality influenced Carl's deceased wife Ellie more than the grouchy main character, and Carl was primarily based on Spencer Tracy, Walter Matthau, James Whitmore, and their own grandparents, because there was [...] "something sweet about these grumpy old guys". Docter and Jonas Rivera noted Carl's charming nature in spite of his grumpiness derives from the elderly [...] "hav this charm and almost this 'old man license' to say things that other people couldn't get away with [...] It's like how <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> to eat with Joe Grant and he would call the waitresses 'honey'. I wish I could call a waitress 'honey'." ...|$|E
500|$|After dating {{for several}} months, Love and Cobain were married on Waikiki Beach in Honolulu, Hawaii on February 24, 1992. Love wore a satin and lace dress {{once owned by}} actress Frances Farmer, and Cobain wore plaid pajamas. Six months later, on August 18, the couple's only child, a daughter, Frances Bean Cobain, was born. In April 1994, Cobain died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in their Seattle home while Love was in rehab in Los Angeles. During their marriage, and after Cobain's death, Love became {{something}} of a hate-figure among some of Cobain's fans. In reflecting on their relationship, Love said: [...] "I think {{that it looked like}} it was headed for doom, but it didn't feel like it was headed for doom on a daily basis. We went mountain biking; <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> camping. We were damn normal." [...] After his cremation, Love divided portions of Cobain's ashes; she kept some in a teddy bear and some in an urn. Another portion of his ashes was taken by Love to the Namgyal Buddhist Monastery in Ithaca, New York in 1994, where they were ceremonially blessed by Buddhist monks and mixed into clay which was made into memorial sculptures.|$|E

500|$|Caribbean Sound Basin housed three {{separate}} studios and several amenities, including a swimming pool, gym, sauna, photographic studio, and bedroom suites. In contrast to most recording studios, its interior was spacious and exposed to natural light. At the studio complex, Raphael, D'wayne, and Riley recorded extensively {{into the night}} {{and went out to}} enjoy the nightlife, before returning to the studio. They often dimmed the lights, burned incense, and drank wine to set the mood when recording, which D'wayne explained in Musician, [...] "We try to make it real calm and mellow. 'Cause {{you want to be able}} to get into what you're singing." [...] They also immersed themselves in the local dancehall scene and attended late-night block parties that lasted until dawn. D'wayne later recalled his nightlife experiences with the group in Maravel: [...] "We'd heard dancehall, but we didn't really know anything about it before going there. <b>We</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> to these block parties and you could hear them from almost a mile away. You'd just park on the street and walk to the party along with four or five thousand other people, all partying with these giant speakers all over the place. And this happened just about every weekend." ...|$|E
500|$|... "She is enigmatic but I {{must tell}} you I never had a bad {{experience}} because of her enigma. What it was, she explained this once, is that she did this on purpose. The choice she made as an actress was, in playing the outsider in the Ewing family, she actually maintained somewhat of an outsider position with the cast as social equals. She didn't {{do a lot of}} the hanging out social activities that a lot of us did because we were together so much. So in that sense, she was maybe a few percentage points removed from the swirl that was the social center of our group. At least twice a year Larry Hagman and I would go up to Canada – fishing trips, hunting trips, things like that. Steve Kanaly was included in that group, and <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> up together, and Steve and I would take other trips together. We were a group, and Linda Gray was also a member of that group. Victoria was always slightly outside and didn't participate in those things. It was her own choice and she felt it was conducive to her playing the part of Pamela. But the times we were together on the set, waiting for scenes to be shot, in the make-up room and everything, it was nothing but convivial." ...|$|E
2500|$|Eastman {{modified}} cellar scenes featuring {{dialogue between}} Helen and Harry Cooper. According to lead actress Judith O'Dea, {{much of the}} dialogue was improvised. She told an interviewer, [...] "I don't know {{if there was an}} actual working script! <b>We</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> over what basically had to be done, then just did it the way we each felt it should be done". One example offered by O'Dea concerns a scene where Barbra tells Ben about Johnny's death: ...|$|E

5000|$|The Tipp-Kick {{version is}} more anthem-like, as it {{features}} the line [...] "Wir würden nie zum FC Bayern München gehen" [...] (<b>We</b> <b>would</b> never <b>go</b> to FC Bayern Munich) throughout the song, {{not only in}} the end and the emphasis is taken off the I-character (the narrator).|$|R
2500|$|During his {{appearance}} on the comedy late night show Late Night with Conan O'Brien on December 11, 1998, eight days before President Bill Clinton was to be impeached, Baldwin said, [...] "If we were in another country ... we would stone Henry Hyde to death and <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> to their homes and kill their wives and their children. We would kill their families, for what they're doing to this country." [...] Baldwin later apologized for the remarks, and the network explained that it was meant as a joke and promised not to re-run it.|$|E
2500|$|Towards {{the evening}} we bade them adieu and took horse, being {{resolved}} that, {{instead of the}} race which fails us, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> to Epsom When we come there we could hear of no lodging, the town so full, but which was better, I went towards Ashsted, and there we got a lodging in a little hole we could not stand upright in While supper was getting I {{walked up and down}} behind my cosen [...] Pepys's house that was, which I find comes little short of what I took it to be when I was a little boy.|$|E
2500|$|Producer Thom Mount (who is {{part-owner}} of {{the real}} Durham Bulls) hired Pete Bock, a former semi-pro baseball player, as a consultant on the film. [...] Bock recruited {{more than a dozen}} minor-league players, ran a tryout camp to recruit an additional 40 to 50 players from lesser ranks, hired several minor-league umpires, and conducted two-a-day workouts and practice games with Tim Robbins pitching and Kevin Costner catching. Bock made sure the actors looked and acted like ballplayers and that the real players acted convincingly in front of the cameras. He said, [...] "the director would say, 'This is the shot we want. What we need is the left fielder throwing a one-hopper to the plate. Then we need a good collision at the plate.' I would select the players I know could do the job, and then <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> out and get it done".|$|E

2500|$|In {{regard to}} this trend, Raekwon later {{clarified}} [...] "We {{was the first to}} be talking that Cristal shit. I know that for a fact.

And our mission would be like, when we sit at the table, we want the best fuckin' wine they got in the building. We might have asked for some Mo or something and they didn't have it. So we was like [...] "What the fuck is the next best thing, Steve?" [...] And Steve's like 'Give 'em the next best thing.' They came out with Cristal. Me and Ghost liked the bottle, and the name on the bottle was Louie Roederer. I was like, I'm Lou Diamond, Louie Roederer. Me and Ghost is loving how the bottle looked. It cost more than the muthafuckin' other, so we was like, Cristal, nigga! That's our new shit!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Zeitgeist debuted at #2 on the Billboard 200, selling 145,000 {{copies in}} its first week. It also reached the top spots on Billboard's Internet Albums and Rock Albums charts {{in its first}} week, and hit the top 10 in Canada (#1), New Zealand (#1), the United Kingdom (#4), Germany (#7), Australia (#7), and other countries. The album was {{certified}} gold by the RIAA with 500,000 copies shipped as of February 1, 2008. Regarding the album's sales in 2010, Corgan stated that the album [...] "went gold. But people didn't listen to it. I could tell that people weren't listening to the album. In the past if you put out an album, people at least knew the first song. <b>We</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> out and play [...] "Doomsday Clock" [...] and I could tell that they hadn't even listened to it.

2500|$|On 28 September 2017, Erdoğan {{requested}} the U.S. to extradite Gülen {{in exchange for}} American pastor Andrew Brunson, under arrest in Turkey on charges related to Brunson's alleged affiliation with [...] "FETO" [...] (the Gulen movement); Erdogan said, [...] "You have a pastor too. Give him to us.... Then we will try [...] and give him to you...." [...] "You have a pastor too. ... You give us that one and we'll work with our judiciary and give back yours." [...] The Federal judiciary alone determines extradition cases in the U.S. An August 2017 decree gave Erdogan authority to approve the exchange of detained or convicted foreigners with people held in other countries. Asked about the suggested swap on September 28, 2017, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said: [...] "I can’t imagine that <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> down that road. ...
