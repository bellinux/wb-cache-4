All the imagery we wanted—and I had a few set ideas, for instance the cat and the idea of Metropolis.

The label sent messages to Dixon and Easter, which the producers told the band that they would ignore.

Dixon called Boberg [...] "record company clueless", while Easter said [...] "I got along with Jay Boberg OK [...] but now and again he would express an opinion that would make me think, 'holy shit', because it would strike me as really teenage." [...] Buck said he was grateful that Dixon and Easter acted as a buffer between the band and its label. He said that [...] "it got to the point where as much as I respected the guys at I.R.S., <b>we</b> <b>basically</b> tried to record the records so they wouldn't know we were recording them!", and explained that part of the reason why R.E.M. recorded the album so quickly was that the group wanted to finish before representatives from I.R.S. showed up to listen to it.|$|E

2500|$|The {{sound of}} the album was notably {{different}} than Forever as the female vocals and violins had disappeared and the band's focus had shifted away from melody towards more technicality and progressiveness, featuring more complex song structures and time signature changes. Remy Beauchamp elaborated, [...] "Basically, it was over three years between the recordings of both albums so within that time, the music we listen to has changed. Also, we all improved on our instruments... The female vocals are just something we tried a long time ago. The song was actually written in 1994, and then every band started doing it {{so we decided to}} drop it. The violin is not out definitely though, we might be putting some on our next album but for 'Day Into Night', we wanted to have a good heavy album, no extras." [...] Bart said that [...] "the production is much better; we spent 3 months in the studio as opposed to a week and a half... Our budget helped as well - <b>we</b> <b>basically</b> spent ten times the amount that we spent on Forever..." [...] He also said, [...] "One thing that many fans asked about... was why there was no violin. At the time we wanted to distance ourselves from all the bands that filled space in their music with different instruments as opposed to writing good music that stood on its own. We did the violin thing five years ago when the idea was a new concept so we wanted to move in. In face, we did record a violin piece for the album but chose not to include it for the reason above. Too many bands with violins. We wanted Day into Night to be heavy and kick ass and not diluted by association." ...|$|E
