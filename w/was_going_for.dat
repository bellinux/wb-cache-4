5|$|For Halloween II, Zombie {{decided to}} focus more on the {{connection}} between Laurie and Michael, and the idea they share similar psychological problems. Zombie wanted the sequel to be more realistic and violent than its 2007 predecessor. For the characters of Halloween II, it is about change. Zombie wanted to look at how the events of the first film affected the characters. Zombie also wanted to show the connection between Laurie and Michael, and provide a glimpse into each character's psyche. Filming primarily took place in Georgia, which provided Zombie with a tax incentive as well as the visual look the director <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>for</b> with the film. When it came time to provide a musical score, Zombie had trouble finding a place to include John Carpenter's original Halloween theme music. Although Carpenter's theme was used throughout Zombie's remake, the theme was only included in the final shot of this film.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Federer {{captured}} one Grand Slam, a singles {{title at}} the US Open over Briton Andy Murray. Federer {{was defeated by}} Nadal in two Grand Slam finals, at the French Open, and at Wimbledon, when he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>for</b> six straight wins to break Björn Borg's record. At the Australian Open, Federer lost in the semifinals to eventual winner Djokovic, which ended his record of 10 consecutive finals. Later in the year, it was found Federer had been suffering from mononucleosis {{at the start of}} the year, particularly during the Australian Open. He lost twice in Masters Series 1000 finals on clay to Nadal, at Monte Carlo and Hamburg. However, Federer captured three titles in 250-level events at Estoril, Halle, and Basel.|$|E
5|$|Merckx {{looked to}} be heading for a record sixth Tour victory in 1975, but Bernard Thévenet beat him, {{becoming}} the first French winner in seven years. Thévenet won again in 1977; however, he was eclipsed in following years by fellow Frenchman Bernard Hinault, who won consecutive Tours in 1978 and 1979. Hinault won the Tour at his first attempt in 1978; becoming one of 11 cyclists (including Anquetil, Merckx, Hugo Koblet and Fausto Coppi) managed to do so. In 1980, Hinault <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>for</b> a third consecutive win, but had to pull out because of tendinitis, and the Tour was won by Joop Zoetemelk. Hinault returned in 1981 and won that race {{as well as the}} one after that. Hinault sat out the Tour in 1983, and another Frenchman—Laurent Fignon—achieved victory. Fignon won again the following year, beating Hinault; Hinault recovered in 1985 to win his fifth Tour.|$|E

25|$|Against Rajasthan in the 1961–62 Ranji Trophy {{semifinal}} {{he scored}} a hundred in 60 minutes while Bengal <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>for</b> a declaration {{in the second}} innings. At {{the time it was}} believed to be the fastest hundred in Indian cricket, but a 60-minute hundred by Ken Goldie in 1915-16 and a 40-minute one by Ahsan-ul-Haq in 1923-24 have been discovered since then. He scored 58 in the first innings and took seven wickets in the same match. He compiled his highest first class score of 227 for Delhi against Patiala in 1957/58 and also took nine wickets in the same match for 81.|$|E
25|$|Finally assenting {{to place}} him in {{competition}} against fighters {{of his own}} weight class, Pride management put him against French jiu jitsu champion Gilles Arsene in a bout Sakuraba dominated and then against Rickson Gracie protege, Antonio Schembri. With a win over Schembri, it was speculated that Sakuraba might be then groomed for a championship fight in a new weight division for fighters of his size. Sakuraba controlled the fight initially, landing plenty of hits and breaking Antonio's nose, but when he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>for</b> one of his trademark Mongolian chops, Schembri stunned him {{with a series of}} knee strikes (controversially preceded by an illegal headbutt), winning by TKO.|$|E
25|$|The Suns {{entered the}} 2006–07 season with their Eyes on the Prize objective, aiming {{to win the}} first {{championship}} in franchise history. From November 20-December 22, the Suns posted a 15-game win streak, followed almost immediately with a 17-game win streak from December 29-January 28. On March 14, the 49-14 Suns met the 52-10 Dallas Mavericks in a marquee matchup with big implications: both teams were fighting for the top seed in the Western conference and Nash <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>for</b> his third consecutive MVP award against Dirk Nowitzki. Though the Suns won the game in double overtime, the Mavericks would finish with the West's top seed at 67-15, and Dirk would narrowly win the MVP award ahead of Nash.|$|E

25|$|The {{second half}} {{was no better}} for Butler going 6 for 37 to end the game. On the other hand, University of Connecticut came out a little hot. They started how they left off, with a huge three. After that shot fell {{the rest of the}} players on Connecticut started to heat up, {{including}} star, Kemba Walker. Although they didn't go on any huge runs to extend the lead tremendously, they were able to push it up to 14 when they had the score 30-44 with about three to four minutes left in the second half. Butler was able to get within nine making 49-40 but at that point with 1:31 left on the clock it was out of reach with the way their shooting <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>for</b> them. Connecticut's last 8 points were all free throws concluding the game and sealing the deal for the win with a final score of 53-41.|$|E
25|$|Bollinger {{was signed}} up by Chennai Super Kings for the 2010 Indian Premier League. He has been {{included}} in the roster after the Super Kings' all-rounder Jacob Oram confirmed his unavailability for the season due to injury. Bollinger arrived for {{the second half of the}} tournament after the end of the tour of New Zealand. Bollinger is the fourth Australian to play for the Super Kings after Matthew Hayden, Michael Hussey and George Bailey. In his IPL debut, he helped Chennai defend a total of 246 against Rajasthan by taking a catch off Yusuf Pathan which <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>for</b> a six; he backpedalled and caught the ball and had to throw it up in the air before falling over the rope and then rebalancing himself to complete the catch. This earned him an award for the best catch of the match. He delivered a spell of 2/15 from four overs dismissing Shane Watson who got 60 off just 25 balls in a match which the other Chennai bowlers averaged 13 runs per over in contrast to his 3.75. Rajasthan ended their innings at 223.|$|E
25|$|England {{now had to}} win {{the final}} three Tests {{if they wanted to}} regain the Ashes, for which the only {{precedent}} was when Don Bradman made three big centuries in the 1936–37 Ashes series to win 3–2 after being 2–0 down to Gubby Allen's England side. Sydney is a famous spinning wicket, though the three tour matches the MCC had seen lots of runs for few wickets. In the New South Wales game immediately before the Third Test they had made 553/8 with Len Hutton making 150 and Reg Simpson 259 and the fast-medium bowler John Warr took 4/67. As a result the unhappy Brian Close was dropped in favour of Warr, making his debut, and England went into the Test with Doug Wright as the only specialist spinner, supported by the part-time spin of Freddie Brown and Denis Compton. The leg-spinner Eric Hollies had taken 5 wickets (78.60) in his three games at the Sydney Cricket Ground and off-spinner Bob Berry <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>for</b> 4 runs an over in his containment role and were not chosen. Denis Compton was fit again and replaced the ailing John Dewes, but Gilbert Parkhouse stayed in the team thanks to his fighting 28 at Melbourne and 92 against New South Wales. Australia kept the same team from the Second Test, though if they had lost the performances of a few of them would have resulted in their being dropped. For the only time in Lindsay Hassett's career as captain he lost the toss in an Ashes Test and Freddie Brown was able to bat first on another flat batting track.|$|E

Slant Magazines staff members listed [...] "Love On Top" [...] as the 24th best song of the year, with Eric Henderson commenting that [...] "somewhere between [...] copious ballads and its few, hyperventilating dance tracks, Beyoncé strikes a perfect balance with this breezy midtempo tribute to the 1980s." [...] On The Village Voices Pazz & Jop critic year-end list in 2011, [...] "Love On Top" [...] was ranked at number 51.

500|$|Critics lauded the {{development}} of the storyline between Shane and Rick. Writing for Best Week Ever, Dan Hopper stated that it presented a cold and eerie outlook {{on the future of the}} two men. Nate Rawlings of Time evaluated their physical confrontation as [...] "darn good", and Alex Crumb of The Faster Times called it [...] "wholly satisfying". Entertainment Weekly writer Darren Franich commended the fight scene; [...] "The Shane/Rick fight was great, a brilliantly extended scuffle that started out with an air of boys-will-be-boys pettiness but quickly escalated into something genuinely homicidal." [...] Goldman summated on the scene: [...] "Of course, it was also gratifying to finally see that conflict turn physical, with a fight we've been waiting to see for a long time. Rick vs. Shane was appropriately brutal and did a very good job of representing the two men's different tactics—Rick was no doubt a formidable and dangerous guy in a fight, wailing on Shane with a series of punches. But Shane <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>for</b> the kill, using anything he could grab as a weapon, as he shoved a motorcycle onto Rick at one point and then threw a massive wrench at him in an effective, 'Holy S**t!' moment." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music for}} So Beautiful or So What was {{inspired}} by West African blues, which Simon combined with [...] "Indian drumming, Old Hollywood strings and bluegrass harmony singing." [...] The songs employ {{a wide variety of}} samples, including from older blues and gospel recordings. [...] "Love Is Eternal Sacred Light" [...] contains a harmonica sample from Sonny Terry, and [...] "Love and Blessings" [...] lifts from The Golden Gate Jubilee Quartet. Simon did not want to record an ordinary studio album and instead, according to Ramone, wanted [...] "lots of space with lots of atmosphere and feeling ... Rather than go for hugely orchestrated ideas he <b>was</b> <b>going,</b> <b>for</b> example, for overtones in bells and gongs. Or if a sax or a kora comes in, they're there to do something specific, and not to fill in the space." [...] The album's music is also largely devoid of heavy bass (some tracks actually using a baritone guitar instead), and drums are very quiet and reserved. Smith said percussion instruments, including exotic bells, ancient hand bells, and glockenspiels, were Simon's favorite to record with for the album. In using bells to augment the sound, Simon put them behind certain guitar notes to “highlight” the sound, as he wanted the recordings to be devoid of echo; he found that using bells created only a slight echo, with an odd, atmospheric tone that he preferred. Drummer Jim Oblon placed towels over each drums to emphasize the higher-frequency percussive instruments.|$|E

500|$|Krusty's {{appearance}} and design is essentially that of Homer Simpson with clown makeup. Groening said that [...] "The satirical conceit that I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>for</b> {{at the time}} was that The Simpsons was about a kid who had no respect for his father, but worshipped a clown who looked exactly like his father", a theme which became less important as the show developed. One concept initially saw Krusty being revealed as Homer's secret identity but the idea was dropped for being too complex and because the writers were too busy developing the series. There are two instances of the one assuming the identity of the other. In a (non-canonical) Butterfinger commercial, pertaining to a contest for $50,000 to find out who stole Bart's Butterfinger, a captured Homer appears to be the culprit until Maggie pulls off a mask, revealing Krusty. [...] In the episode [...] "Homie the Clown", Homer goes to Clown College and dresses up as and is confused with Krusty. Krusty was originally just a normal man wearing clown makeup, but David Silverman noted that [...] "at some point, we decided he looked [...] all the time." [...] The producers had long discussions about whether or not Krusty would always remain in his clown makeup but eventually decided that it did not matter. The writers had tried showing Krusty's real face a few times in early episodes, but decided that it did not look right, although his real face was seen in [...] "Krusty Gets Busted" [...] and [...] "Like Father, Like Clown". Later episodes made jokes about Krusty's face. In [...] "Homer's Triple Bypass", Krusty reveals that his [...] "grotesque appearance" [...] is the result of multiple heart attacks. Homer remarks that he seems fine, and Krusty replies, [...] "This ain't makeup." [...] In [...] "Bart the Fink", [...] he abandons an idea to sail away with a new identity and swims towards shore, leaving a trail of yellow makeup in his wake and his natural white face underneath. On shore, he shakes off his black hair, revealing his natural green clown hair, and removes his normal-looking fake nose to reveal his natural red bulbous clown nose underneath.|$|E
