40|$|Palladium-catalysed {{coupling}} reactions have gained importance {{as a tool}} for the production of pharmaceutical intermediates {{and to a lesser extent}} also for the production of agrochemicals, flavours and fragrances, and monomers for polymers. In this review only these cases are discussed where it seems highly likely that the technology is or has been used for ton-scale production. We document twelve cases where the Mizoroki-Heck reaction was used to arylate an alkene. In two of these cases allylic alcohols <b>were</b> <b>arylated,</b> leading to the aldehyde or the ketone. The Suzuki reaction has been used mostly to produce biaryl compounds from aryl halides and arylboronic acid derivatives. Twelve processes were recorded. Ortho-tolyl-benzonitrile, a biaryl compound produced via the Suzuki reaction, is used as an intermediate in six different pharmaceuticals all belonging to the Sartan group of blood pressure-lowering agents. The Kumada-Corriu reaction in which an aryl or alkenyl Grignard is coupled to an aryl or alkenyl halide was used nine times. In these {{coupling reactions}} palladium is often replaced by the much cheaper nickel or iron catalysts. The Negishi reaction couples an arylzinc halide with an aryl or alkenyl halide. These reactions are fast and highly selective; the only drawback being the stoichiometric zinc waste. Two cases were found. In one of these it was possible to use only a catalytic amount of zinc (double metal catalysis). The Sonogashira reaction couples a terminal alkyne to an aryl or alkenyl halide. Three cases were found. Acetylene is usually not coupled as such in view of its instability. Instead, trimethylsilylacetylene or the acetylene acetone adduct is used. Finally, one case was found of a palladium-catalysed allylic substitution and one case of a CH-activation reaction to form a benzocyclobutane ring.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} the preparation {{and use of}} diaryliodonium salts. In Project I various unsymmetrical diaryliodonium salts were reacted with three different nucleophiles in order to study the chemoselectivity of the reactions of the salts. The main focus of this project was to gain {{a deeper understanding of}} the underlying factors that affect the chemoselectivity in transition metal-free arylation reactions. They were found to be very nucleophile-dependent. Some nucleophiles were very sensitive to electronic effects, whereas others were sensitive to steric factors. Ultimately, some arenes are never transferred. A very interesting scrambling reaction was also observed under the reaction conditions, where unsymmetrical diaryliodonium salts form symmetrical salts in situ. Project II details the preparation of N-heteroaryliodonium salts via a one-pot procedure. The salts were designed so that the N-heteroaryl moiety was selectively transferred in applications both with and without transition metals. The chemoselectivity was demonstrated by selective transfer of the pyridyl group onto two different nucleophiles. The third project in the thesis discusses the synthesis of alkynyl(aryl) iodonium salts and alkynylbenziodoxolones from arylsilanes. This protocol could potentially be a very useful complement to the existing procedures, in which boronic acids are used. The last part of the thesis (Project IV) describes a C- 2 selective arylation of indoles where diaryliodonium salts were used in combination with hetero-geneous palladium catalysis. This transformation was performed in water at ambient temperature to 50 °C, and tolerated variations of both the indole and the diaryliodonium salt.

50|$|Similar {{zirconium}} complexes can be formed; however, {{substitution of}} the phosphinimide {{must be done}} through {{the addition of the}} lithium salt, as the R3PNSiMe3 method isn’t effective. Sodium cyclopentadienide can be added to a dihalide phosphinimide to add another Cp or a different Cp ring to the metal and displace a halide. Unlike the titanium complex, the addition of two phosphinimide ligands requires a slightly different route. R3PNH reacted with Zr(NEt2)4, followed by substitution of the remaining NEt2 ligands with Cl through the addition of Me3SiCl yields the bis(phsphinimide) (R3PN)2ZrCl2. Comparable to the titanium complexes, the zirconium complexes can <b>be</b> alkylated or <b>arylated</b> through simple substitution. Once alkylated with Me, reaction with THF and B(C6F5)3 produces the cationic complex R3PNZr(Cp)Cl(THF)+.|$|R
