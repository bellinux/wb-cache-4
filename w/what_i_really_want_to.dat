2500|$|Xi Zheng, then an {{assistant}} {{official in the}} palace library, often visited Meng Guang to consult him. When Meng Guang asked him what the crown prince, Liu Xuan, had been learning and reading {{and what he was}} interested in, Xi Zheng replied, [...] "He treats the people around him respectfully. He is very diligent and hardworking. He has the style of a crown prince of ancient times. When he meets people, he shows sincerity, kindness and generosity in everything he says and does." [...] Meng Guang then said, [...] "This is what is expected of every other person. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> know is his level of political wisdom and how good his political skills are." [...] Xi Zheng replied, [...] "The Crown Prince's approach towards life is to focus on winning people's hearts and favour. He won't do what he shouldn't do. He doesn't openly reveal his wisdom. Besides, political skills can only be used under certain circumstances; they cannot be cultivated and learnt in advance." [...] Meng Guang knew that Xi Zheng was trying to careful with his words, so he said, [...] "I like to speak my mind as freely as possible. Every time I openly make criticisms, people will ridicule or hate me for that. Although I sense that you don't like to hear what I say, my words make sense. The Empire is not unified yet. Political skills are crucial in this time and age. While one's mastery of political skills depends on his intellectual abilities, political skills can be learnt and mastered through diligence. This {{has to do with the}} Crown Prince's education. He should be striving to enrich himself with as much knowledge as possible so that he can be like a consultant. He should also sit for written and oral tests like academics and gain some titles. This is a top priority for him." [...] Xi Zheng strongly agreed with him.|$|E
