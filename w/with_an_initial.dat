40|$|Almost-linear systems being introduced, {{the facts}} about the systems were cleared, and it was shown that the almost-linear systems contain linear systems <b>with</b> <b>a</b> non-zero <b>initial</b> state as <b>a</b> sub-class [1]. In this paper, based on the these results of almostlinear systems [1], we will discuss the {{real-time}} realization problem of linear systems <b>with</b> <b>a</b> non-zero <b>initial</b> state, namely, we will treat the problem to obtain the systems by single-experiment. The algorithm for the problem is presented. It {{is well known that}} a usual method to obtain linear systems <b>with</b> <b>a</b> non-zero <b>initial</b> state is solved through two problems. One is the problem to obtain linear systems <b>with</b> <b>a</b> zero <b>initial</b> state and the other is the state estimation problem for the systems <b>with</b> <b>a</b> non-zero <b>initial</b> state [2], that is usually called the observer problem. And the situation of these two problems is very rare in practice. This paper presents a new method to obtain them directly on real-time (equivalently, by a singleexperiment). Therefore, this new method is more useful and practical than usual. ...|$|R

40|$|A unit {{evolution}} step of discrete-time quantum walks {{is determined}} by both a coin-flip operator and a position-shift operator. The behavior of quantum walkers after many steps delicately depends on the coin-flip operator and <b>an</b> <b>initial</b> condition of the walk. To get the behavior, a lot of long-time limit distributions for the quantum walks starting <b>with</b> <b>a</b> localized <b>initial</b> state have been derived. In the present paper, we compute limit distributions of a 2 -state quantum walk <b>with</b> <b>a</b> delocalized <b>initial</b> state, not <b>a</b> localized <b>initial</b> state, and discuss how the walker depends on the coin-flip operator. The initial state induced from the Fourier series expansion, which is called the (α,β) delocalized initial state in this paper, provides different limit density functions from the ones of the quantum walk <b>with</b> <b>a</b> localized <b>initial</b> state.
