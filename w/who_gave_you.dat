This {{would allow the}} studio to advertise American Graffiti as [...] "from the Man <b>who</b> <b>Gave</b> <b>you</b> The Godfather (1972)".

Lucas, Katz and Huyck worked on the third draft together, specifically on the scenes featuring Steve and Laurie.|$|E

2500|$|On 1 November, the {{plotters}} summoned many {{senior officers}} who {{were not involved in}} the plot to the Joint General Staff headquarters at Tân Sơn Nhứt Air Base, on the pretext of a routine lunchtime leadership meeting. Mậu and Đôn organised the invitations and set up the trap. At 13:45, Đôn announced that a coup was taking place. Most of the officers rose to applaud, while those who did not and refused to turn against Diệm were arrested.

2500|$|Creators of Gorillaz, {{musician}} Damon Albarn {{and artist}} Jamie Hewlett, {{began working on}} a new Gorillaz project in November 2007 called Carousel, which evolved into Plastic Beach, the group's third studio album. In the November 2007 issue of Q, when asked what his top priority for 2008 was, Damon Albarn replied [...] "Well, I'm doing the next Gorillaz thing, but it won't be called Gorillaz."

Those were presented as by 'The Who' even though none {{of the members of the}} band were in the movies. I don't think anyone from The Who was in Quadrophenia. But it's the same people working on it, that's the principle." [...] In a July 2008 interview with The Observer he also said, [...] "Gorillaz now to us is not like four animated characters any more— it's more like an organisation of people doing new projects. [...] That's my ideal model— Gorillaz is a group of people <b>who</b> <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> this, and now want to give you new stuff." ...|$|E

Gradishar's hitting ability was a {{sentiment}} echoed in Rick Korch's book, The Truly Great. In it, Tony Dorsett recalled the hit Gradishar gave him in a 1980 game, [...] "I ran a pass pattern and was wide open but Danny White did not see me. I go back to the huddle and tell Danny that I am wide open. I ran the same route again but this time I was almost decapitated. My eyes were only partially open when I hit the ground. Trainers and doctors came running onto the field. They thought I was dead. Hey, I thought I was dead, too." [...] Hall of Fame defensive lineman Dan Hampton remembers asking Walter Payton, [...] "Walter, <b>who</b> <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> the hardest hit you ever took in the NFL?". According to Hampton, Payton replied, [...] "Randy Gradishar, 1978".
