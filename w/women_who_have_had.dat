5|$|Some sexually {{transmitted}} diseases are communicable between women, including human papillomavirus (HPV)—specifically genital warts—squamous intraepithelial lesions, trichomoniasis, syphilis, and herpes simplex virus (HSV). Transmission of specific {{sexually transmitted}} diseases among women {{who have sex with}} women depends on the sexual practices women engage in. Any object that comes in contact with cervical secretions, vaginal mucosa, or menstrual blood, including fingers or penetrative objects may transmit {{sexually transmitted diseases}}. Orogenital contact may indicate a higher risk of acquiring HSV, even among <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> no prior sex with men.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{study was}} done to compare risk factors for HIV/STDs in <b>women</b> <b>who</b> {{reported}} <b>having</b> <b>had</b> sex with both men and <b>women</b> and <b>women</b> <b>who</b> reported <b>having</b> <b>had</b> sex with men only. METHODS: Female participants in a multisite, randomized HIV/STD prevention study in the Seattle area reported both <b>having</b> <b>had</b> sex with {{a man in the}} 3 months before and <b>having</b> at least 1 risk factor for HIV/STDs during the year before the study. Of these <b>women,</b> 38 % <b>who</b> reported ever <b>having</b> <b>had</b> sex with a woman were compared with those <b>who</b> reported <b>having</b> <b>had</b> sex with men only. RESULTS: <b>Women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> sex with both men and women were more likely than <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> sex with men only to report drug use in the 3 months before the study, a greater lifetime number of male partners, a sex partner <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> sex with a prostitute, an earlier age at sexual debut, and forced sexual contact (P <. 01 for all comparisons). <b>Women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> sex with both men and women <b>had</b> a mean of 3. 2 of these 5 risk factors, vs 2. 1 among <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> sex with men only (P <. 001). CONCLUSION: <b>Women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> sex with both men and women were more likely than <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> sex with men only to engage in multiple risk behaviors. Health workers should be aware of bisexual experience among women, since this may be a marker for multiple risk behaviors for HIV/STDs...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveWomen <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> preeclampsia {{demonstrate}} higher {{prevalence of}} metabolic syndrome (MetS), impaired vascular function, and increased sympathetic activity and are {{at increased risk}} of cardiovascular disease. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the effects of 12 weeks of exercise training (70 - 80 % maximum volume of oxygen utilization) in <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> preeclampsia on physical fitness, components of MetS, vasculature, and autonomic functions compared with healthy control subjects. Study DesignOur prospective case-control study included 24 normotensive <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> preeclampsia and 20 control subjects who were matched for age and postpartum interval (all 6 - 12 months after delivery). Before and after training, we measured all components of MetS (ie, BP, lipids, glucose/insulin, and albuminuria), carotid intima media thickness (IMT) and brachial and superficial femoral artery endothelial function that used flow-mediated dilation (FMD). Autonomic activity was quantified with power spectral analysis (low-frequency/high-frequency power [LF/HF] ratio). ResultsAt baseline, <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> preeclampsia demonstrated higher values of most components of MetS. Compared with the control subjects, <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> preeclampsia <b>had</b> increased IMT (580 ± 92 μm vs 477 ± 65 μm, respectively), impaired endothelial function (FMD brachial artery, 5. 3 % ± 2. 2 % vs 10. 8 % ± 3. 5 %, respectively; FMD superficial femoral artery, 4. 9 % ± 2. 1 % vs 8. 7 % ± 3. 2 %, respectively) and increased LF/HF power ratio (2. 2 ± 1. 0 vs 1. 3 ± 0. 4, respectively; all P <. 05). In both groups, exercise training decreased values of most components of MetS and IMT, improved FMD, and concurrently reduced LF/HF. Despite these improvements, vascular and autonomic variables did not normalize by 12 weeks of training in <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> preeclampsia. ConclusionThis study demonstrates that exercise training in <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> preeclampsia and control subjects improves components of MetS, endothelial function, vascular wall thickness, and autonomic control. Nonetheless, trained <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> preeclampsia only reached a cardiovascular status that is comparable with sedentary healthy control subjects...|$|R

25|$|Removal of ovaries causes {{hormonal}} {{changes and}} symptoms similar to, but generally more severe than, menopause. <b>Women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> an oophorectomy are usually {{encouraged to take}} hormone replacement drugs to prevent other conditions often associated with menopause. Women younger than 45 who have had their ovaries removed face a mortality risk 170% higher than women who have retained their ovaries. Retaining the ovaries when a hysterectomy is performed is associated with better long-term survival. Hormone therapy for women with oophorectomies performed before age 45 improves the long-term outcome and all-cause mortality rates.|$|E
