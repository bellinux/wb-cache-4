25|$|Employee {{turnover}} rate {{is a significant}} problem in many industries. According to a 2008 report, {{turnover rate}} among sales people has exceeded 40% annually with similar figures in the US. This is a disadvantage to businesses because replacing labor is extremely costly. The report studied the impact cognitive-behavioral therapy had on 166 financial service sales agents from a major British insurance company which had recently been acquired by a competitive, results-oriented organization. Measurements were based on employee well-being, job satisfaction, productivity and turnover. Major organizational changes lead to {{a substantial number of}} employees quitting. Three months prior to the study, 71% of the participants reported experiencing <b>work-related</b> <b>stress</b> and performing poorly. According to the results, there were major improvement in employees' attributional style, psychological distress, self-esteem, job satisfaction and intention to quit. Symptoms of psychological stress warranting intervention reduced from 37% of the sample to 10% after training. The psychological changes were also accompanied by a 66% reduction in employee turnover rate. Productivity had also improved post two years after training where 65% of the sample had achieved sales figures above the average. This is a significant increase prior to training where 29% of participants were barely performing at acceptable standards.|$|E

25|$|Many {{studies have}} {{reported}} significant psychosocial risk factors for bruxism, particularly a stressful lifestyle, and this evidence is growing, but still not conclusive. Some consider emotional stress {{to be the main}} triggering factor. It has been reported that persons with bruxism respond differently to depression, hostility and stress compared to people without bruxism. Stress has a stronger relationship to awake bruxism, but the role of stress in sleep bruxism is less clear, with some stating that there is no evidence for a relationship with sleep bruxism. However, children with sleep bruxism have been shown to have greater levels of anxiety than other children. People aged 50 with bruxism {{are more likely to be}} single and have a high level of education. <b>Work-related</b> <b>stress</b> and irregular work shifts may also be involved. Personality traits are also commonly discussed in publications concerning the causes of bruxism, e.g. aggressive, competitive or hyperactive personality types. Some suggest that suppressed anger or frustration can contribute to bruxism. Stressful periods such as examinations, family bereavement, marriage, divorce, or relocation have been suggested to intensify bruxism. Awake bruxism often occurs during periods of concentration such as while working at a computer, driving or reading. Animal studies have also suggested a link between bruxism and psychosocial factors. Rosales et al. electrocuted lab rats, and then observed high levels of bruxism-like muscular activity in rats that were allowed to watch this treatment compared to rats that did not see it. They proposed that the rats who witnessed the electrocution of other rats were under emotional stress which may have caused the bruxism-like behavior.|$|E
2500|$|Distress is a {{prevalent}} {{and costly}} problem in today's workplace. About one-third of workers report {{high levels of}} stress. 20-30% of workers in different sectors of the European Union reported in 2007 that they believed <b>work-related</b> <b>stress</b> was potentially affecting their health. Three-quarters of employees believe the worker has more on-the-job stress than a generation ago. In Great Britain, a sixth of the workforce experiences occupational stress every year. Evidence also suggests that distress is the major cause of turnover in organizations. With continued distress at the workplace, workers will develop psychological and physiological dysfunctions and decreased motivation in excelling in their position.

40|$|Background. The {{impact of}} {{psoriasis}} upon {{the quality of}} life contributes significantly to the overall morbidity associated with the disease. An older age at onset of psoriasis and being a man have been associated previously with lower psychosocial morbidity. In order to further evaluate these potentially important mitigating factors, we examined the relation of age and gender on some aspects of psoriasis-related psychosocial morbidity. Methods. Two hundred and fifteen consenting psoriasis patients, representing a wide range of disease severity, were studied. They included 110 men and 105 women, age range 19 – 87 years (age: mean ± SD: 48 · 0 ± 15 · 9 years); all endorsed a list of 30 items (by checking a “Yes” or “No”) pertaining to life events related to psoriasis that they had experienced in the previous one month. The patients self-rated the severity of their psoriasis. The patients were categorized into four age groups of 18 – 29 years (N = 28), 30 – 45 years (N = 77), 46 – 65 years (N = 76), and > 65 years (N = 34), respectively, for the statistical analyses. Results. No age or gender differences in the severity of psoriasis were observed. Patients of both sexes in the 18 to 29 and 30 to 45 year age groups reported more frequent (P < 0 · 05) problems related to both appearance/socialization and occupation/finances, in contrast to patients in the 46 – 65 and over- 65 -year age groups. No gender differences (P < 0 · 05) were observed in the frequency of items related to appearance and socialization; however, men reported greater <b>work-related</b> <b>stresses.</b> Conclusion. Psoriasis has a greater impact upon {{the quality of life}} of patients in the 18 to 45 year age range and affects the socialization of both sexes equally.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Work-related</b> chronic <b>stress</b> is {{a common}} problem among workers. The core {{complaint}} is that the employee feels exhausted, which {{has an effect on}} the well-being and functioning of the employee, and an impact on the employer and society. The employee’s absence is costly due to lost productivity and medical expenses. The usual form of care for <b>work-related</b> chronic <b>stress</b> is coaching, using a cognitive-behavioural approach whose primary aim is to reduce symptoms and improve functioning. Light therapy and pulsed electromagnetic field therapy are used for the treatment of several mental and physical disorders. The objective {{of this study is to}} determine whether coaching combined with light therapy plus pulsed electromagnetic field therapy is an effective treatment for reducing absenteeism, fatigue and stress, and improving quality of life compared to coaching alone. Methods/design The randomized placebo-controlled trial consists of three arms. The population consists of 90 participants with <b>work-related</b> chronic <b>stress</b> complaints. The research groups are: (i) intervention group; (ii) placebo group; and (iii) control group. Participants in the intervention group will be treated with light therapy/pulsed electromagnetic field therapy for 12  weeks, twice a week for 40  min, and coaching (once a fortnight for 50  min). The placebo group receives the same treatment but with the light and pulsed electromagnetic field switched to placebo settings. The control group receives only coaching for 12  weeks, a course of six sessions, once a fortnight for 50  min. The primary outcome is the level of return to work.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the association between <b>work-related</b> moral <b>stress,</b> moral climate and moral sensitivity in mental health nursing. By means of the three scales Hospital Ethical Climate Survey, Moral Sensitivity Questionnaire and Work-Related Moral Stress, 49 participants’ experiences were assessed. The results of linear regression analysis indicated that moral stress was determined to a degree by the work place’s moral climate as well as by two aspects of the mental health staff’s moral sensitivity. The nurses’ experience of ‘moral burden’ or ‘moral support’ increased or decreased their experience of moral <b>stress.</b> Their <b>work-related</b> moral <b>stress</b> was determined by the job-associated moral climate and two aspects of moral sensitivity. Our findings showed an association between three concepts: moral sensitivity, moral climate and moral stress. Despite being a small study, the findings seem relevant for future research leading to theory development and conceptual clarity. We suggest that more attention be given to methodological issues and developing designs that allow for comparative research in other disciplines, as well as in-depth knowledge of moral agency.

40|$|Managerial women {{experience}} {{a number of}} work-related stressors which roduce strain symptoms that function as predictors of their ill-health in organizations. This finding is made from a study that examined the existing relationships among job characteristics symptoms of stress, {{and the development of}} health outcomes (depression, anxiety and physical symptoms) among women in lower and middle management positions in some organizations in Ghana. The stratified and simple random sampling procedure was used to select the study participants which numbered 170 female managers. Data was collected using both questionnaires and interviews, and analyzed using the Occupational Stress Indicator, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale, and the Beck's Anxiety Inventory. It is concluded that since work-related stressors are predictors of women managers' ill-health in the work environment, organizations {{should be aware of the}} stressors in order to be able to guard against the deterioration of job performances of their women managers.

40|$|The Australian higher {{education}} sector has accepted that increasing <b>work-related</b> <b>stresses</b> can {{have a negative impact}} on the quality and productivity of academic life. Workplace stresses can have significant financial impact both on university budgets and the overall economy due to poor decision-making, health issues and accidents resulting from illness. Engineering academics that teach and/or research within {{higher education}} institutions have been reported anecdotally to have a high prevalence of stress. The actual (self-perceived) level however has been largely unquantified. The research reported in this paper was conducted to assess self-perceived stress levels and identify the stress factors within a cohort of engineering academics at the University of Southern Queensland (USQ), a small regionally based Australian university renowned for its distance education. The questionnaire was applied using a mix of validated and non-validated survey instruments and incorporated a set of questions previously applied at the University of Adelaide (UoA). Findings from USQ are broadly in line with those independently reported elsewhere for Australia and the UK, with some minor exceptions. In summary the USQ project indicates that engineering academics have higher perceived stress levels than the validated health threshold, with significant variation based on age, academic type (teaching-research), and for staff with English as a second language. The results from both universities also indicated that there are significant stress contributors related to the pressure to obtain grants and to publish and to the (low) resultant levels of recognition from employers for any success. More specific to distance education providers (such as USQ), there are stress contributors related to servicing and dealing with the external mode of course design, delivery and lecture preparation. ...|$|R

Conceptually, the relationship between stress (as reflected in life events) and distress (as reflected in depressed symptoms) is hypothesized to hold across societies. At the same time, the measures of stress must reflect the social reality of a particular community of society. In the case of urban China, the politically-imposed stratification system arranges individuals and family lives around work units. These work units dictate all aspects of the life of the worker and his or her family, ranging from housing, major purchases, access to local and distance facilities, schooling and employment for children, to retirement pension and funeral expenses. As a result, relationships in the work context are expected to produce stress-inducing conflicts.
