5|$|Blackcurrants {{can grow}} well on sandy or heavy loams, or forest soils, {{as long as}} their {{nutrient}} requirements are met. They prefer damp, fertile but not waterlogged ground and are intolerant of drought. Although the bushes are <b>winter</b> <b>hardy,</b> frosts during the flowering period may adversely affect the yield and cold winds may restrict the number of flying insects visiting and pollinating the flowers. A pH of about 6 is ideal for blackcurrants and the ground can be limed if the soil is too acidic. Planting is usually done in the autumn or winter to allow the plants to become established before growth starts in the spring, but container-grown stock can be planted at any time of year.|$|E

50|$|In {{temperate}} zones, the corms of {{most species}} and hybrids should be lifted in autumn and stored over winter in a frost-free place, then replanted in spring. Some species from Europe and high altitudes in Africa, {{as well as}} the small 'Nanus' hybrids, are much hardier (to at least -15 °F/-26 °C) and can be left in the ground in regions with sufficiently dry <b>winters.</b> 'Nanus' is <b>hardy</b> to Zones 5-8. The large-flowered types require moisture during the growing season, and must be individually staked as soon as the sword-shaped flower heads appear. The leaves must be allowed to die down naturally before lifting and storing the corms. Plants are propagated either from small cormlets produced as offsets by the parent corms, or from seed. In either case, they take several years to get to flowering size. Clumps should be dug up and divided every few years to keep them vigorous.|$|R

This is particularly true {{within the field of}} skeletal regenerative medicine. However, much remains unknown regarding the native origins of MSC, the relative advantages of different MSC populations for bone regeneration, and even the biologic safety of such unpurified, grossly characterized cells. This review will first summarize the initial discovery of MSC, as well as the current and future applications of MSC in bone tissue engineering. Next, the relative advantages and disadvantages of MSC isolated from distinct tissue origins are debated, including the MSC from adipose, bone marrow, and dental pulp, among others. The perivascular origin of MSC is next discussed. Finally, we briefly comment on pluripotent stem cell populations and their possible application in bone tissue engineering. While continually expanding, the field of MSC-based bone tissue engineering and regeneration shows potential to become a clinical reality in the not-so-distant future.

50|$|Anopheles walkeri has a {{multivoltine}} life cycle. It {{produces a}} <b>hardy</b> <b>winter</b> egg which differs morphologically {{from the more}} vulnerable summer eggs by having enlarged floats on the dorsal side. By overwintering in egg form, this species is able to mature through one full larval generation before hibernating adults of other species are able to become active. The multivoltine life cycle means this species is active during both the swampy, open water conditions of early spring, as well as {{later in the year}} after the swampland has become thickened with plant growth. It takes about 10 days to mature through the larval stages and pupate, dependent on temperature and water conditions. Adults will typically mate within a few hours of emergence from their pupated form. The females then begin to seek out a blood meal to provide necessary protein to facilitate egg development. The female will then rest while the eggs develop. Once mature, the eggs are oviposited and the female begins the process all over again, feeding and laying for the 40 days or so that it lives for.|$|R
