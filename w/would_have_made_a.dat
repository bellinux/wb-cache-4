5|$|At this point, the Greeks of Laconia and Arcadia, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of a certain Michael, tried to stop the Franks at the olive grove of Kountouras in northeastern Messenia. Modern scholars have traditionally identified this Michael with Michael I Komnenos Doukas, founder of the Despotate of Epirus, but this identification has been questioned more recently by Raymond-Joseph Loenertz, as the fragile nature of his control over Epirus <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> departure to aid the Moreote Greeks a major and unlikely gamble.|$|E
5|$|Parties {{bringing}} {{judicial review}} must have sufficient {{interest in the}} challenged subject. Professor Mullen therefore {{suggests that it is}} at first glance surprising that standing was not contested: the appellants brought proceedings in their personal capacities, yet had not even been threatened with prosecution. However, he suggests that no challenge was made because the legislation was likely to be challenged at some point and it was more convenient for the Government to have the legal issue decided before the Hunting Act came into force. Moreover, the recent expansion of standing for issues of public interest, such as the validity of an Act of Parliament, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> successful challenge more difficult.|$|E

5|$|Another {{innovation}} {{was the use}} of a dummy head to {{find the}} location of an enemy sniper. The tempting target of a realistic papier-mâché head was raised above the parapet on a stick running in a groove on a fixed board. To increase the realism, a lit cigarette could be inserted into the dummy's mouth and be smoked by a soldier via a rubber tube. If the head was shot, it was dropped rapidly, simulating a casualty. The sniper's bullet <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> hole in the front and back of the dummy's head. The head was then raised in the groove again, but lower than before by the vertical distance between the glasses of a trench periscope. If the lower glass of a periscope was placed before the front bullet hole, its upper glass would be at exactly the same height as the bullet had been. By looking through the rear hole in the head, through the front hole and up through the periscope, the soldier would be looking exactly along the line the bullet had taken, and so would be looking directly at the sniper, revealing his position.|$|E
5|$|Larry Vaughn {{arrives at}} the Brody house before Brody returns home, and informs Ellen {{that he and his}} wife are leaving Amity. Before he leaves, he tells Ellen that he always thought they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> great couple. When Brody and Quint return to sea the {{following}} day, the shark starts ramming the boat, but Quint is able to harpoon it several times. The shark leaps out of the water and onto the stern of the Orca, ripping a huge hole in the aft section and causing the boat to begin to sink. Quint plunges another harpoon into the shark, but as it falls back into the water, his foot gets entangled in the rope, and he is dragged underwater to his death as he drowns. Brody, now floating on a seat cushion, spots the shark swimming towards him and prepares for his death. However, just as the shark gets within a few feet of him, it succumbs to its many wounds, rolls over in the water, and dies before it can kill Brody. The great fish sinks down out of sight, dragging Quint's still entangled body behind it. Brody manages to paddle back to shore on his makeshift float, the lone survivor of the ordeal.|$|E

25|$|Two of {{the further}} designs made by Bücker's Swedish {{engineer}} Anders J.

The Bü 182 Kornett, the last plane designed by Anderson, of which only three were built, also found no support in the Air Ministry of the Reich, even though it combined technical progress and low-cost. The Bü 182 Kornett was a highly innovative model, fitted with a low-priced high-performance engine, that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> good trainer for the Luftwaffe.|$|E

25|$|Having {{defeated}} Olivier Rochus, Marsel İlhan and Evgeny Korolev in the Australian Open, González {{was defeated}} by Andy Roddick in the fourth round in a tense, controversial five-set match lasting 3 hours and 25 minutes. On set point in the fourth set, a Roddick forehand winner was called out which Roddick challenged. Hawk-eye revealed that the ball was in fact in, and Roddick received the set. Gonzalez argued that the point should have been replayed, {{as he had been}} in the right position and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> play on the ball if it had been called in. Gonzalez lost the match, 3–6, 6–3, 6–4, 5–7, 2–6.|$|E
25|$|Some {{historians and}} admirers of Patel such as Rajendra Prasad, the first President of India and {{industrialist}} J. R. D. Tata have expressed {{the opinion that}} Patel <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> better prime minister for India than Nehru. These admirers and Nehru's critics cite Nehru's belated embrace of Patel's advice regarding the UN and Kashmir and the integration of Goa by military action and Nehru's rejection of Patel's advice on China. Proponents of free enterprise cite the failings of Nehru's socialist policies as opposed to Patel's defence of property rights and his mentorship {{of what was to}} be later known as the Amul co-operative project. However, A. G. Noorani, in comparing Nehru and Patel, writes that Nehru had a broader understanding of the world than Patel.|$|E
25|$|From 1814, Keats had two bequests, held {{in trust}} for him until his 21st birthday: £800 willed by his {{grandfather}} John Jennings (about £50,000 in today's money) and {{a portion of his}} mother's legacy, £8000 (about £500,000 today), to be equally divided between her living children. It seems he was not told of either, since he never applied for any of the money. Historically, blame has often been laid on Abbey as legal guardian, but he may also have been unaware. William Walton, solicitor for Keats's mother and grandmother, definitely did know and had a duty of care to relay the information to Keats. It seems he did not. The money <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> critical difference to the poet's expectations. Money was always a great concern and difficulty for him, as he struggled to stay out of debt and make his way in the world independently.|$|E

25|$|Before {{the events}} of the issue, the Zamarons chose Pharon as their new queen and {{recipient}} of the Star Sapphire, but a dissenting group of Zamarons claimed that Ferris <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> superior queen. Angered by the opposition, Pharon travels to Earth and attacks Ferris in retaliation (which was the cause of her aircraft malfunction). Recognizing the attack provokes Ferris to become Star Sapphire again and defend herself. At the conclusion of their duel, Ferris appears to be the victor and leaves to challenge Jordan. Following his defeat, she forces him to travel with her to Zamaron and become her husband. Before the wedding, Jordan discovers that the woman he believed to be Ferris is really Pharon in disguise. Jordan finds the real Ferris living Pharon's life on Xanador, and brings her to Zamaron. He defeats Pharon and returns with Ferris to Earth without her retaining any knowledge of the events that transpired.|$|E
25|$|The {{next decade}} brought the United States Football League (USFL), which played its {{season in the}} spring instead of autumn. After three seasons of play during which it never had {{the same number of}} teams and many franchises moved, it also filed an {{antitrust}} suit it had brought against the NFL. Seeking {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} and damages, USFL v. NFL centered around the NFL's television contracts, and in addition to the financial damages, it also sought to invalidate the league's contracts with at least one of the Big Three television networks that dominated U.S. TV at the time. The jury concluded that the NFL was indeed violating antitrust laws but refused to tear up the broadcast contracts (noting that a last-ditch effort to move the league's season to autumn forced out numerous major market teams that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> television package more appealing) and only awarded a token $3 judgment in the USFL's favor. The failure to secure either objective in the lawsuit, coupled with mounting debts, prompted the USFL to cease operations.|$|E
25|$|The {{approach}} procedure in use for this flight {{in the low}} clouds and low visibility conditions that night required the pilot to fly over the MAC VOR at 3,900 feet, then turn west-northwest to fly out over the water, descend to 1,540 feet and level off within nine miles, then make a left base turn to fly east, back toward the airport (a teardrop procedure turn), and descend for final approach {{with the use of}} the MAC VOR. The pilot was not allowed to descend below 1,540 feet until the turn was completed, and then not below 1,045 feet unless he had the runway in sight. Once the pilot could see the airport from that altitude, he would be allowed to circle and land on the runway of his choice. This is called a circle-to-land manoeuvre, or sometimes a cloud break procedure. The pilot elected to attempt this circling approach to land on runway 29 instead of landing straight in on runway 11, though the reported clouds at the time <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> circling approach impossible at the minimum altitude of 1,045 feet.|$|E

25|$|The {{interpretation}} by Frey & Riess {{became the}} dominant one, but was challenged in 2004 by Sanders, who showed experimentally that, whereas an alternate movement {{might have caused}} excessive pitching, a simultaneous movement would have caused only a slight pitch, {{which could have been}} easily controlled by the hind flippers. Of the other axial movements, rolling could have been controlled by alternately engaging the flippers of the right or left side, and yaw by the long neck or a vertical tail fin. Sanders did not believe that the hind pair was not used for propulsion, concluding that the limitations imposed by the hip joint were very relative. In 2010, Sanders & Carpenter concluded that, with an alternating gait, the turbulence caused by the front pair would have hindered an effective action of the hind pair. Besides, a long gliding phase after a simultaneous engagement would have been very energy efficient. It is also possible that the gait was optional and was adapted to the circumstances. During a fast steady pursuit, an alternate movement would have been useful; in an ambush, a simultaneous stroke <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> peak speed possible. When searching for prey over a longer distance, a combination of a simultaneous movement with gliding would have cost the least energy. In 2017, a study by Luke Muscutt, using a robot model, concluded that the rear flippers were actively employed, allowing for a 60% increase of the propulsive force and a 40% increase of efficiency. The stroke would have been at its most powerful using a slightly alternating gait, the rear flippers engaging just after the front flippers, to benefit from their wake. However, there would not have been a single optimal phase for all conditions, the gait likely having been changed as the situation demanded.|$|E
