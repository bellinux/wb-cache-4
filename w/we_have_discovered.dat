6000|$|... "We might, Robin. Would {{it not be}} wise {{to return}} and let Slagg and Stumps know what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>discovered,</b> and take counsel {{together}} before we act." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{question}} {{of the relationship of}} the three persons, of whose existence <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> traces, was a very interesting one to Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine.|$|R
60|$|Then Leo {{sank back}} into the chair where <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> him bound, and seemed to fall {{into a kind of}} torpor, for of a sudden he grew to look like an old man.|$|R
5000|$|Cleo pushed {{boundaries}} in mainstream publishing with candid articles on topics ranging from sex toys, fantasies and orgasms, to lesbianism and contraception. [...] "We wrote about sex as if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> it", recalls Buttrose.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is Monsieur Lassen, {{the manager}} of Madame, who has caused {{a great deal of}} trouble here," [...] she said. [...] "Madame never trusted him and now <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>discovered</b> that he is a spy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{complications}} {{suggested by}} Josie {{will require a}} lawyer's advice," [...] he said, [...] "and Mr. Conant knows law and can advise us {{how to handle the}} case when <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>discovered</b> where Alora is confined." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We shall {{go without}} till <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>discovered</b> some {{vegetable}} oil or wax to serve us," [...] replied Brother Timon, in a decided tone, which caused Sister Hope to resolve that her private lamp should be always trimmed, if not burning.|$|E
6000|$|... "We can't do it, David," [...] he repeated, [...] "We {{are dressed}} for the tropics. We should freeze to death among the snows and glaciers long before <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> a pass to the {{opposite}} side." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{week later}} {{we were told}} that Guttorm was dying, and {{that he wanted to be}} buried inside the castle; for <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> that the people were what they called Christians, and that they had consecrated ground there.|$|R
60|$|I {{remember}} {{as we sat}} in a Canadian canoe, in a reedy, bush-masked shallow <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> operating out of that pine-shaded Woking canal, how she fell talking {{of the things that}} happened to her before she met me again....|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Colonel, {{if you do}} not mind, I {{should like}} to go to one of the {{provision}} stores at once. Possibly, after what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>discovered,</b> some pretext to stop further examination may be invented, if we wait till tomorrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose," [...] said Beth thoughtfully, [...] "that it {{is because}} <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>discovered</b> for {{ourselves}} the old truth {{that it is more}} blessed to give than to receive. I've always known it, in a way, but I never realized it before." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed we shall," [...] she promised. [...] "Now that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>discovered</b> you we'll {{wear out}} our welcome {{coming to see}} you. Yes, we must go [...] . 'we must tear {{ourselves}} away,' as Paul Irving says every time he comes to Green Gables." ...|$|E
6000|$|Ghak and I {{looked at}} each other. Relief was written upon his countenance and I {{know that it was}} beating {{strongly}} in my heart. At last <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> a tangible clue to the whereabouts of Hooja--and with the clue a guide! ...|$|R
60|$|A {{month later}} the {{atmosphere}} <b>had</b> changed completely. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> how hopeless the German position really was, a discovery which some, though not all, had anticipated, but {{which no one}} had dared reckon on as a certainty. It was evident that <b>we</b> could <b>have</b> secured unconditional surrender if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> determined to get it.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, {{that would}} be too good. Write, that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> a plot on Cyril's part to {{incorporate}} the whole of the African churches (mind and specify Carthage and Hippo) under his own jurisdiction, and to throw off allegiance to the Patriarch of Constantinople, in case of Heraclian's success.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "DEAR DOCTOR: I {{do think}} that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>discovered</b> beyond doubt that [...] the man is an impostor, and that whoever he may be, he is not John [...] Simcoe. When you can spare time, please come round. It is too long [...] to explain." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I think <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>discovered</b> a rough diamond.

60|$|Sank {{with her}} dead freight--sank, and {{snatched}} forever from our power the corpse which <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> almost by a miracle--those jealously-preserved remains, on the safe-keeping of which rested so strangely {{the hopes and}} the love-destinies of two living beings! As the last signs of the ship {{in the depths of}} the waters.|$|R
6000|$|... "Some {{there are}} who claim already to have {{accomplished}} the thing. It is generally supposed that the etherealists {{have quite a}} few among their number who are permanent materializations. It is even said that such is Tario, but that cannot be, for he existed before <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> the full possibilities of suggestion.|$|R
50|$|So, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> just <b>discovered</b> the tensor reps (with density) of the diffeomorphism group.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me," [...] said Audah the Adept, [...] "that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>discovered</b> {{the manner in}} which Coo-ee-oh raised the island. She would burn some sort of magic powder in the basin, utter the magic word, and the pillar would {{lengthen}} out and lift the island with it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Captain Graham," [...] he interrupted, [...] "don't try to understand. I {{will tell}} {{you as much as}} this, if it helps you. Henry's Restaurant will be placed under the closest surveillance, but we wish nothing {{disturbed}} there at the moment until <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>discovered</b> the future plans of Mr. Oscar Fischer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not know, Miss Porter," [...] {{replied the}} young man, [...] "unless <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>discovered</b> a runaway simian from the London Zoo who has {{brought back a}} European {{education}} to his jungle home. What {{do you make of}} it, Professor Porter?" [...] he added, turning to the old man.|$|E
40|$|Warning: <b>We</b> <b>have</b> {{recently}} <b>discovered</b> {{a technical}} {{error in the}} paper cond-mat/ 9504032 and entitled here above, that invalidates part {{but not all of}} our conclusions.

60|$|We {{aimed to}} land {{near the site}} of ancient Ostend. But when we neared the coast we {{discovered}} no indication of any human habitations whatever, let alone a city. After <b>we</b> <b>had</b> landed, <b>we</b> found the same howling wilderness about us that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> on the British Isle. There was no slightest indication that civilized man had ever set a foot upon that portion of the continent of Europe.|$|R
6000|$|... "Further {{investigation}} of the room revealed nothing which could throw any light on the purpose of our inquiry. We examined the clothes, jewelry, and books of the deceased. These we left under lock and key. We also found her dressing-case, which we protected by seals, and took away with us to the Fiscal's office, {{along with all the}} other articles that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> in the room.|$|R
6000|$|... "As sure as may be," [...] he replied; [...] "having only ancient legend {{to support}} my belief. But see how closely, so far, each detail tallies with the world-old story of the hegira of the yellow race. Yes, I am sure that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>discovered</b> the way to their ancient hiding place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is," [...] he said, [...] "a most {{unpleasant}} thing, and {{is known}} to three men only, of whom I am one. We have also arranged that nobody else will chance upon what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>discovered.</b> You see, Ferris is unfortunately connected with you, and his people have had trouble enough already." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{proportion}} as {{the art of}} war {{has increased}} in improvement has the art of preserving peace advanced in equal ratio; and as <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>discovered,</b> {{in this age of}} wonders and inventions, that proclamation is the most formidable engine of war, so have we discovered the no less ingenious mode of maintaining peace by perpetual negotiations.|$|E
60|$|I was {{confident}} that we should find a station in some one of the coves, for I knew that the rookeries of Bering Sea were thus guarded; but Maud advanced the theoryâ€”to prepare me for disappointment, I do believe, if disappointment were to comeâ€”that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> an unknown rookery. She was in very good spirits, however, and made quite merry in accepting our plight as a grave one.|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed a}} good idea. I felt curious myself. We agreed to explore in {{different}} directions, {{returning to the}} summit to report progress. In half an hour we stood together once again. There {{was no need for}} words. The face of one and all of us announced plainly that at last <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> a recess of German nature untarnished by the sordid suggestion of food or drink.|$|R
40|$|Recently {{my colleagues}} and I {{announced}} {{the discovery of a}} remarkable planet orbiting a special kind of star known as a pulsar. Based on the planet's density, and the likely history of its system, we concluded that it was certain to be crystalline. In other words, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>discovered</b> a planet made of diamond. Following the publication of our finding in the journal Science, our research received amazing attention from the worldâ€™s media...|$|R
