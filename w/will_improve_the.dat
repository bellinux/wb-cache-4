5|$|Deep ecology is a {{movement}} founded by Arne Naess that establishes principles {{for the well-being of}} all life on Earth and the richness and diversity of life forms. The movement advocates, among other things, a substantial decrease in human population and consumption along with the reduction of human interference with the nonhuman world. To achieve this, deep ecologists advocate policies for basic economic, technological, and ideological structures that <b>will</b> <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> quality of life rather than the standard of living. Those who subscribe to these principles are obliged to make the necessary change happen. The concept of a billion-year Sustainocene has been developed to initiate policy consideration of an earth where human structures power and fuel the needs of that species (for example through artificial photosynthesis) allowing Rights of Nature.|$|E
5|$|At {{the very}} bottom right corner, two Polish Jews are {{on the edge of}} the scene; the younger (36) one is usually {{described}} as enthralled by the events, watching them with hope, but most analysis focuses on the older man (37), whose hand is making a Sy, git ("that's good") gesture. Interpretation of this figure varies; while some suggest that he express his interest and support for the Constitution, which he sees as a promise of further reforms that <b>will</b> <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> situation of the Jews—the Constitution had not addressed them in any significant way—others put him, or both of the Jews, among the opponents of the Constitution, describing them as frowning and disturbed, gleefully anticipating the end of the Commonwealth, or at least concerned with the liberal reforms. The latter interpretation can be also supported by the fact that Matejko tended to portray Jews in his paintings in negative roles.|$|E

25|$|As {{shown in}} the {{timetable}} from 13 December 2008, capacity constraints meant that through London Bridge there were no northbound Thameslink trains in the morning peak between 07:24 and 09:09, and no southbound Thameslink trains in the evening peak between 16:43 and 18:27. During these times, Brighton line Thameslink trains ran via Herne Hill instead. The present work is designed in part to remedy this situation. It <b>will</b> <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> flow not only of Thameslink services but also of all Southeastern commuter services from Kent into Charing Cross and Cannon Street.|$|E
25|$|Backer/Stabilizer: Backing and {{stabilizer}} {{are often}} used interchangeably to refer to materials, generally non-woven textiles, which are placed inside or under the item to be embroidered. The backing provides support and stability to the garment which <b>will</b> <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> quality of the finished embroidered product. Backings come primarily in two types: cutaway and tear-away. With cutaway, the excess backing is cut {{with a pair of}} scissors. With tear-away, the excess is torn away after the item is embroidered. Additional types of stabilizer can be dissolved by water or heat.|$|E

25|$|Since {{its initial}} construction, very {{little has been}} updated or modified. However, {{intensive}} renovation efforts were begun in 2009 for the upcoming 2010 celebrations. Much of the equipment and machinery is original from the early 20th century. Much of the technological equipment is being updated, especially in the theatre which needs computerized lights, sound systems and other improvements. Other work <b>will</b> <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> acoustics. Upgrades to the theatre will allow for multimedia shows which were not available before. The main hall has had no renovation or upgrade work since it opened in 1934.

This program <b>will</b> <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> quality of life of the population of Porto Alegre by restoring water quality along the west side of Lake Guaíba and directly benefitting more than 700,000 residents through expanded public sanitation services and urban environmental improvement.|$|E
25|$|Behavioural change {{theories}} are attempts {{to explain why}} behaviours change. These theories cite environmental, personal, and behavioural characteristics as the major factors in behavioural determination. In recent years, there has been increased interest {{in the application of}} these theories in the areas of health, education, criminology, energy and international development with the hope that understanding behavioural change <b>will</b> <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> services offered in these areas. Some scholars have recently introduced a distinction between models of behavior and theories of change. Whereas models of behavior are more diagnostic and geared towards understanding the psychological factors that explain or predict a specific behavior, theories of change are more process-oriented and generally aimed at changing a given behavior. Thus, from this perspective, understanding and changing behavior are two separate but complementary lines of scientific investigation.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, when warranted, {{specific}} tests—the mirror test, vasoconstriction examinations, and the Cottle maneuver—are {{included to}} the pre-operative {{evaluation of the}} prospective rhinoplasty patient. Established by Maurice H. Cottle (1898–1981), the Cottle maneuver is a principal diagnostic technique for detecting an internal nasal-valve disorder; whilst the patient gently inspires, the surgeon laterally pulls the patient's cheek, thereby simulating the widening of the cross-sectional area of the corresponding internal nasal valve. If the maneuver notably facilitates the patient's inspiration, that result is a positive Cottle sign—which generally indicates an airflow-correction to be surgically effected with an installed spreader-graft. Said correction <b>will</b> <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> internal angle of the nasal valve and thus allow unobstructed breathing. Nonetheless, the Cottle maneuver occasionally yields a false-positive Cottle sign, usually observed in the patient afflicted with alar collapse, and in the patient with a scarred nasal-valve region.|$|E

Its goal is to prevent suicide among LGBT youth by having gay adults convey the message that these teens' lives <b>will</b> <b>improve.</b> <b>The</b> project has grown rapidly: over 200 videos were uploaded in the first week, and the project's YouTube channel reached the 650 video limit in the next week. The project is now organized on its own website, the It Gets Better Project, and includes more than 50,000 entries from people of all sexual orientations, including many celebrities; the videos have received over 50 million views.|$|E
25|$|The core {{objective}} in {{training to be}} a solo diver is to become as self-sufficient and self-reliant as possible, {{to be able to}} deal with any reasonably foreseeable problems without assistance, and to have the competence, fitness, discipline, skills and equipment that will achieve this result. This requires competence at risk-assessment and the ability to plan dives and select equipment that limit the risks. An additional benefit of these disciplines is that they <b>will</b> <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> safety of buddy diving whenever the competent solo diver pairs up with another diver in a buddy team by reducing the risk of the second diver being exposed to an emergency which they may not be capable of managing. Agencies training solo divers also recommend the self-sufficiency training in their courses for all divers as their diving experience grows, so as to achieve greater safety in all diving—buddy and solo.|$|E
