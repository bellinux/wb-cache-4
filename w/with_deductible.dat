40|$|Abstract. Delta Dental, {{a dental}} {{insurance}} company, bases their rates on past data {{that does not}} include dental plans <b>with</b> <b>deductibles.</b> This is because these plans were not historically common. As more plans incorporate a deductible, the data being used to determine rates should include data <b>with</b> <b>deductibles.</b> To see if this new method would provide a more accurate rate, an analysis of 2001 - 2002 annual data was used in manual pure-premium calculations for given groups, including those <b>with</b> <b>deductibles.</b> The composite rates or premiums were then calculated and compared with the actual premiums charged in 2003. The premiums that were calculated are only slightly greater than those that were actually charged and thus, based on the 2001 - 2002 data, the method Delta Dental currently uses is feasible...|$|R

5000|$|Deductibles are {{typically}} used {{to deter the}} large number of claims that a consumer can be reasonably expected to bear the cost of. By restricting its coverage to events that are significant enough to incur large costs, the insurance firm expects to pay out slightly smaller amounts much less frequently, incurring much higher savings. As a result, insurance premiums {{are typically}} cheaper when they involve higher deductibles. For example, health insurance companies offer plans with high premiums and low <b>deductibles,</b> or plans <b>with</b> low premiums and high deductibles.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects of an uninsurable {{background}} risk (BR) on the demand for insurance (proportional and <b>with</b> <b>deductible).</b> We study both the case of BR uncorrelated with the insurable one and the perfectly correlated one, in a Gaussian world. In order to perform our study, we exploit the new risk measure known as Value at Risk (VaR) and consider insurance contracts which are Mean-VaR efficient. We obtain results which depend on the parameters (moments) of both risks and on the magnitude of loadings charged by the insurance company, instead of depending on the risk attitudes of the insured, such as risk aversion and prudence. We demonstrate that, if loadings are not too high, the demand for insurance increases with positively correlated BR; it decreases with BR negatively correlated if the latter is less risky than the insurable one (in this case it can even go to zero, if loadings are too high); it goes to zero with BR which is negatively correlated and more risky than the insurable one.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{a new way}} {{of reducing}} the major individual tax expenditures: capping the total amount that tax expenditures as a whole can reduce each individual's tax burden. More specifically, we examine the effect of limiting the total value of the tax reduction resulting from tax expenditures to two percent of the individual's adjusted gross income. Each individual can benefit from the full range of tax expenditures but can receive tax reduction only up to 2 percent of his AGI. Simulations using the NBER TAXSIM model project that a 2 percent cap would raise $ 278 billion in 2011. The paper analyzes the revenue increases by AGI class. The 2 percent cap would also cause substantial simplification by inducing more than 35 million taxpayers to shift from itemizing their deductions to using the standard deduction. For any taxpayer for whom the 2 percent cap is binding, a cap would reduce the volume of wasteful spending and the associated deadweight loss. Even for those taxpayers for whom the cap is not binding but who are induced by the cap to shift from itemizing to using the standard deduction, the deadweight loss associated <b>with</b> <b>deductible</b> expenditures would be completely eliminated...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{contributes}} {{to our understanding}} of the determinants of price responses to inclusion in the S&P 500 by providing evidence consistent with capital gains tax planning impacting stock reactions. Tests are conducted on 426 additions from 1978 - 1999. We regress the returns on the first trading day following announcement on a capital gains tax measure and controls. The evidence is consistent with the share prices of appreciated firms being temporarily bid up to compensate individual shareholders for any unanticipated capital gains taxes triggered when they sell to index funds and the share prices of depreciated firms being temporarily diminished when individual shareholders sell because buyers and sellers share the tax savings associated <b>with</b> <b>deductible</b> capital losses. We infer from these findings that in rebalancing their portfolios after S&P 500 additions, index funds share individual shareholders' capital gains taxes (or tax savings) through sales price adjustments. Consistent with temporary price pressure, further analysis shows that much of the price reaction unwinds over the following week's trading. Finding that personal capital gains taxes affect stock returns in a setting that does not bias toward taxes mattering suggests that capital gains tax capitalization may be a pervasive feature in equity valuation. ...|$|E

40|$|Deductibles are {{commonly}} used to tame increasing health care costs. Numerous studies find that higher deductibles reduce health care utilization.

Moreover, we {{take advantage of a}} policy change in 2005 that introduced the higher deductible for the first time.

40|$|In health insurance, a {{traditional}} <b>deductible</b> (i. e. <b>with</b> a <b>deductible</b> range [0,d]) is in theory not {{effective in reducing}} moral hazard for individuals who know (ex-ante) that their expenditures will exceed the deductible amount d, e. g. those with a chronic disease. To increase the effectiveness, this paper proposes to shift the deductible range to [si,siÂ +Â d], with starting point si depending on relevant risk characteristics of individual i. In an empirical illustration we assume the optimal shift to be such that the variance in out-of-pocket expenditures is maximized. Results indicate that for the 10 -percent highest risks in our data the optimal starting point of a [euro] 1000 -deductible {{is to be found}} (far) beyond [euro] 1200, which corresponds <b>with</b> a <b>deductible</b> range of [1200, 2200] or further.

40|$|A {{great deal}} of effort and {{ingenuity}} has been addressed to patching holes in the income tax attributable to realization accounting. A classic instance {{of the problem is}} the headachescreated by capital gains, whereby the taxpayer can choose to postpone recognition of gain and accelerate recognition of loss (known as cherry picking). The inconsistencies resulting from realization accounting are most pronounced than in the taxation of financial instruments, especially requirements for income measurement rules based on realization that are `linear' in the sense that doubling a person's transactions will double the taxable income, and adding one set of transactions to another will result in the sum of the associated income. Under present realization conventions, the tax law cannot be linear because there would then be no limit on tax arbitrage profit via variations on borrowing <b>with</b> <b>deductible</b> interest and lending tax exempt. To focus on the principles, the paper assumes transactions are costless. In that case, it is shown that to deal with the intertemporal aspect requires virtually universal imputation of taxable interest income to basis. To deal with the risk aspect of the problem (lock-in and cherry picking) requires simply that the effective rate of tax on gains and losses be the same (not necessarily equal to the rate on intertemporal returns). A new method is proposed that satisfies the requirements for linear income measurement. It is shown that the retroactive taxation of gain devised by Alan Auerbach is a special case of the new approach (involving a zero effective rate of tax on gains and losses). ...|$|E
40|$|The {{first chapter}} {{examines}} consumer choices {{of health insurance}} contracts. An important innovation in health insurance design is a high-deductible health plan paired with a health savings account (HSA). These contracts aim to control costs by linking insurance coverage with tax incentives for saving, but their rules are highly complex. How consumers perceive the features of these contracts may dampen any cost reduction and produce unintended welfare effects by distorting plan choices. Using a novel administrative dataset linking health insurance choices, medical claims, and saving in HSAs and 401 (k) s from a large U. S. health insurer, I develop and estimate a model that integrates HSA saving <b>with</b> <b>deductible</b> choices. I estimate over two-thirds of the marginal HSA dollar is allocated to reduce the deductible, which counteracts the contract 2 ̆ 7 s cost-control incentives and leads consumers to choose different insurance plans than they would without an HSA. In this setting, using HSA contributions to offset higher deductibles produced no reduction in health care costs. Several counterfactual analyses quantify the welfare implications of using the HSA to finance current costs on moral hazard, plan enrollment and premiums, and the consumption smoothing benefits from insurance. Health insurance contracts that require sophisticated consumer decision-making may work well in theory, but may be less effective and lead to unintended consequences in practice. ^ The second chapter investigates how status affects health by comparing mortality between Gold and Silver medalists in Olympic Track and Field. Contrary to conventional wisdom, winners die over two years earlier than losers. Analysis of individual Census records of each athlete and his parents suggests that income is the key mechanism: losers pursued higher-paying occupations than winners after the Olympics, while parental earnings in childhood were similar. An athlete’s performance relative to expectations plays an auxiliary role, but is much less important than income. The results suggest that how people respond to pivotal life events can produce long-lasting consequences for health. ...|$|E
