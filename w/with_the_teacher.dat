5|$|Sjumandjaja {{was born}} in Batavia on 5 August 1934. The fifth of eight children, Sjumandjaja was ethnically Javanese but soon became {{accustomed}} to the local Betawi culture. He studied Quran reading {{for a period of}} three days, but stopped after numerous disagreements <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher.</b> When he was ten years old, his father died, leaving Sjumandjaja to be raised by his mother. During the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies from 1942 to 1945, he witnessed several forced labourers being beaten to death near his home during the construction of Kemayoran Airport.|$|E
5|$|As Emma, Mary Margaret, and Graham {{search the}} wooded area for John Doe, they {{are joined by}} Henry. Henry {{believes}} that the patient is looking for Mary Margaret. They soon discover the patient lying near the bridge seen in the fairytale flashback, and Mary Margaret revives him. As they take {{him back to the}} hospital, Regina shows up with a woman named Kathryn (Griffith), and states that she is his wife and that the patient's name is David Nolan. This devastates Mary Margaret, as she had begun to develop feelings for the patient. Emma becomes suspicious of Regina's ability to find Nolan's wife and questions why Kathryn never bothered to search for him before. Although Regina claims that past hospital surveillance tapes had David mentioning Kathryn's name in his sleep, Emma still believes that Regina is lying. Later that evening, Emma arrives at Mary Margaret's place and agrees to take up the offer of staying <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher.</b>|$|E
5|$|Researchers in {{the field}} {{advocate}} a teaching style that incorporates group problem-solving activities and demands higher-level thought. According to this process, a teacher initially poses a single question {{in a number of}} ways. Next, students discuss the problem <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> and amongst themselves, asking questions. In forming these questions, students are actively brainstorming and recalling prior knowledge. At this point, the teacher provides specific conditions of the issue discussed, and students must adapt their prior knowledge, along with that of their peers, to generate a solution. Other curriculum designs tailored to young children such as “” incorporate practices which aim to improve students’ capacity to shift and prolong attention as well as think “outside the box” (i.e. generate creative solutions).|$|E

5|$|Waller taught Sunday school {{while in}} his early teens. When he was 15, he {{attended}} Williams College, from which he graduated in 1834. At Williams College, he came near to being expelled after arguing with a teacher. After Williams College, he considered being a lawyer, businessman or government worker. His brother William advised against his becoming a government worker or businessman, {{so he decided to}} become a minister. He attended the Princeton Theological Seminary starting in October 1834 and continuing for three years. Here he also came near to being expelled after a dispute <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> John Breckenridge. He graduated from the Princeton Theological Seminary in 1837 with a Bachelor of Divinity degree. Waller moved to Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania in 1838.|$|E

25|$|Savant agreed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher,</b> {{saying the}} chances were only 1 out of 3 {{that the woman}} had two boys, but 1 out of 2 the man had two boys. Readers argued for 1 out of 2 in both cases, {{prompting}} follow-ups. Finally she began a survey, asking female readers with exactly two children, {{at least one of}} them male, to give the sex of both children. Of the 17,946 women who responded, 35.9%, about 1 in 3, had two boys.|$|E
25|$|Conflicts of {{interest}} can arise when the professional responsibilities {{of a teacher}} are affected, or appear to be affected, by a special personal relationship with a student. These can include showing favoritism towards a student sexually involved <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher,</b> or hostility towards a student due to a past relationship. If a teacher is sexually involved with a student, colleagues may feel pressured to give preferential treatment to the student, such as better marks, extensions on essays, extra help, or academic opportunities. When there are multiple relationships between several staff and students, the possibilities for conflict {{of interest}} are enormous. Even {{if there is no}} favoritism or hostility, it can be perceived by others to be exhibited.|$|E

25|$|A {{study by}} Conklin and Wilkins shows growth and {{advances}} in reading levels among elementary students when using a guided reading approach. Working <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> {{in small groups}} gave students {{a chance to work}} on specific skills, at their reading level. Students gained confidence when reading 'just right' texts. Since they were not struggling with the text they were able to develop vocabulary, reading comprehension skills and oral language skills. Gabl, Kaiser, Long and Roemer found similar results when providing reading intervention in the form of guided reading groups to grade two and grade four students. The results showed an increase in reading fluency and comprehension after using flexible grouping in guided reading.|$|E
25|$|As {{in other}} Buddhist traditions, an {{attitude}} of reverence for the teacher, or guru, is also highly prized. At {{the beginning of a}} public teaching, a lama will do prostrations to the throne on which he will teach due to its symbolism, or to an image of the Buddha behind that throne, then students will do prostrations to the lama after he is seated. Merit accrues when one's interactions <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> are imbued with such reverence in the form of guru devotion, a code of practices governing them that derives from Indian sources. By such things as avoiding disturbance to the peace of mind of one's teacher, and wholeheartedly following his prescriptions, much merit accrues and this can significantly help improve one's practice.|$|E
25|$|The young Luis {{was first}} educated at the Madrid Instituto de San Isídro, a prestigious Jesuit {{establishment}} with long distinguished record; {{it is there}} where he got his baccalaureate and where he made acquaintances, some of them later public figures like Luis Urquijo, marqués de Amurrio. However, it is also at the college where despite his penchant for letters he ran into problems <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> of Retórica y Poética, resulting in Luis’ later lukewarm attitude towards the Jesuits and formal education. At unspecified date he entered Facultad de Derecho at Universidad de Madrid; not averse towards bohemian lifestyle, he befriended the likes of Alejandro Sawa and Ramón Valle Inclán. Date of graduation is not known, apart that it was prior to 1905; at that time he was already practicing law as an intern, to open his own law office later on. In honor of his maternal family Luis got his name changed from Hernando y Larramendi to Hernando de Larramendi y Ruiz.|$|E

25|$|The Jivamukti Yoga {{method of}} {{meditation}} is a mantra form of meditation, and follows a three-step procedure: choose a seat, be still, and focus. The mantra “Let-Go” is taught to all Jivamukti students, {{and provides the}} focus. The practitioner is instructed to align the silent repetition of the mantra with the incoming and outgoing breath. By witnessing the continuous movement of breath through the body and thought through the mind, Jivamukti teaches that the practitioner can eventually let go of identification with the body and mind and come to realize the supreme Self. The Jivamukti method holds realization of the supreme self or enlightenment {{to be the ultimate}} goal of yoga. The class usually begins with Sanskrit chanting; this is followed by detailed meditation instruction and then about 20 minutes of actual sitting practice. Afterwards there is a Q session <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher,</b> and a final closing.|$|E
25|$|The {{composition}} pedagogy {{of moderate}} expressivism {{is characterized by}} a focus on language as a tool for personal rather than social expression, based on the process theory of composition, a belief that the process of writing should be more important than the final product. Further, moderate expressivist pedagogy calls for less grammatical standards and an increased focus on the writer’s process of discovery and expression. W.E. Coles, Jr. suggests that teaching writing should be approached as teaching art, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> serving as facilitator or guide for the student-writer’s free expression; he also calls for classroom practices such as peer-reviews, class discussions, and the absence of grades, in order to best guide the self-identification he sees as crucial to the writing process. Fellow moderate expressivist Donald Murray maintains that writing is a process of discovery and experimentation, a search for truth in a specious world; his manifesto-like essay provides an apt summation of the arguments against the dated pedagogy of CTR. Likewise, Maxine Hairston recognizes the paradigm shift occurring in rhetoric and composition and calls for a non-prescriptive atmosphere in teaching, including less focus on grammar and syntax and, again, more concern with the process of growth experienced by the writer. Peter Elbow reflects moderate expressivist ideals in his claim that audience should be ignored during {{the early stages of the}} writing process, in order to avoid the hindrance of audience expectation and facilitate writer-based rather than reader-based text. Elbow writes, “It’s not that writers should never think about their audience. It’s a question of when.” Simply put, moderate expressivism promotes the notion of process over product, a pedagogy that evolved in the height of the 1960s and in many ways reflects the ideologies of the era in its emphasis on freedom, expression, discovery, and a search for the writer’s authentic self.|$|E
500|$|There are {{two general}} {{education}} academy programs {{offered at the}} school. [...] Both programs, Bridges Academy and Expedition Academy, are for students in grades 9 and 10. [...] Bridges Academy, known simply as [...] "Bridges", focuses on students who are identified in 8th grade as possibly having difficulty transitioning {{to the high school}} setting for academic, social, and/or emotional reasons. [...] In the program, they are able to take required classes in a smaller setting, averaging around 10 students per class, to allow for more one-on-one interaction <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher.</b> Until 2014, students spent the morning part of their day at the Central School annex, returning to the main high school campus at lunch.

30|$|A {{number of}} {{procedures}} {{were used to}} achieve fidelity of implementation. The control condition was regular course instruction, and occurred in the course (Fall 2011) prior to when the intervention was administered (Spring 2012 and Fall 2012). After the control semester was completed, and prior to beginning the intervention, the first author met <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> {{to go through the}} intervention materials. Next, the first author obtained the lecture slides from <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> from <b>the</b> Fall 2011 course, inserted the intervention slides, and sent them back to <b>the</b> <b>teachers.</b> <b>The</b> <b>teachers</b> were contacted again immediately prior to the first intervention session to remind <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> of <b>the</b> protocol. Finally, after the course was finished, the first author met <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> to debrief on their implementation and experiences <b>with</b> <b>the</b> intervention.

500|$|The 1990s {{brought a}} focus on greater {{independence}} for people with disabilities, and more inclusion in mainstream society [...] In schools, {{students with special needs}} were placed in regular classrooms rather than segregated settings, which led to an increased use of AAC as a means of improving student participation in class. Interventions became more collaborative and naturalistic, taking place in the classroom <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher,</b> rather than in a therapy room. Facilitated communication – a method by which a facilitator physically and emotionally supports a person with severe communication needs as they type on a keyboard or letter board – received wide attention in the media and in the field. [...] The question of the authorship made the approach controversial; most of the subsequent research indicated that the facilitators were unknowingly influencing the messages typed. As a result, professional organizations and AAC researchers and clinicians have not typically accepted facilitated communication.|$|E
500|$|During one scene, Wendy tells Stan {{that she}} smelled Ms. Ellen taking a [...] "smelly dump" [...] in the {{bathroom}} {{in an attempt to}} make him less attracted to her. In the original script, Wendy originally told Stan that she had a yeast infection, but Comedy Central censors made Parker and Stone change the line. Parker and Stone said although the network typically provides great leniency in permitting obscene jokes, they often object to lines about female hygiene problems. During a cafeteria scene, a boy visible at a lunch table in the background looks exactly like Craig Tucker, but the color of his hat has been changed to make him appear to be a different character. The idea of Ms. Ellen taking one of the children to dinner came from Parker's real-life experiences. At his school, the children were able to have lunch <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> and principal if they were awarded [...] "Student of the Week". Parker said he went on one of the lunches once and found the experience [...] "really, really creepy" [...] because he had the impression the teacher and principal were having a romantic affair.|$|E
500|$|Garret {{initially}} attended his father's {{school in}} Long Branch. The Hobart {{family moved to}} Marlboro in the early 1850s; Garret {{was sent to the}} village school. [...] Childhood tales of the future vice president describe him as an excellent student in both day and Sunday School, and a leader in boyhood sports. [...] Recognizing Garret's abilities, his father sent him to a well-regarded school in Freehold, but after a disagreement <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher,</b> the boy refused to return; he was sent to Middletown Point Academy, (later known as the Glenwood Institute) a prominent school in Matawan, New Jersey. He also boarded there during the week. [...] He graduated from the academy in 1859 at age 15, but being thought by his parents too young to go to college, remained home for a year studying and working part-time. During this time, he was a school teacher in the Bradvelt School which was the same school as his father's employment. [...] Garret Hobart then enrolled in Rutgers College, from which he graduated in 1863 at age 19, finishing third in his class. [...] He received his diploma from Theodore Frelinghuysen, New Jersey's first major-party vice-presidential candidate, who had run unsuccessfully with Henry Clay in 1844.
