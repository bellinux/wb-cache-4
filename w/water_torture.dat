25|$|Waterboarding {{is a form}} of <b>water</b> <b>torture</b> {{in which}} water is poured over a cloth {{covering}} the face and breathing passages of an immobilized captive, causing the individual to experience the sensation of drowning. Ordinarily, the water is poured intermittently so as to prevent death during torture, however, if the water is poured uninterruptedly it will lead to death by asphyxia with the sensation of drowning, also called dry drowning. Besides death, waterboarding can cause extreme pain, damage to lungs, brain damage from oxygen deprivation, other physical injuries including broken bones due to struggling against restraints, and lasting psychological damage. Adverse physical consequences can manifest themselves months after the event, while psychological effects can last for years.|$|E

The ordeal of water seems to have been frequently used as well as torture, which was not otherwise common in Sweden; torture devices were specially made to be used in this trial, which was conducted in a similar manner to witch trials in other countries where they were more common. A commission of priests was gathered to judge.|$|R
5000|$|Claire Fuentes is an American-born Filipina {{living in}} Manila and {{working as a}} cafe {{entertainer}} {{on the eve of}} the attack on Pearl Harbor. She meets and marries an American soldier, Sgt. John Phillips (Douglas Kennedy), and with her husband, witnesses the Japanese invasion of the Philippines during the siege of Bataan. Her husband is captured, and she watches as he is killed by machine gun fire in the Bataan Death March after he defies the order of a cruel Japanese soldier not to drink from typhoid contaminated water. In retaliation, Phillips uses a handgun to shoot and kill a Japanese soldier. She then joins the anti-Japanese resistance, and in order to obtain intelligence to send back to the United States, she opens a nightclub catering to Japanese officers. Phillips is code named [...] "High Pockets" [...] for her habit of stashing items in her brassiere. She successfully passes useful intelligence on to the American forces and the Filipino underground, but is then discovered, imprisoned, and <b>water</b> <b>tortured</b> by the Japanese. Sentenced to death, she is rescued in the nick of time by American soldiers (one of whom is Cpl. John Boone (Gene Evans)) who storm Bilibid Prison, killing the Japanese guards. In 1951, she is awarded the Medal of Freedom on the recommendation of General Douglas MacArthur.|$|R
5000|$|Men {{and women}} captives [...] {{as well as}} teenage boys, would usually face death by ritual torture. The torture had strong {{sacrificial}} overtones, usually to the sun. [...] Captives, especially warriors, were expected to show extreme self-control and composure during torture, singing [...] "death songs", bragging of one's courage or deeds in battle, and otherwise showing defiance. [...] The torture was conducted publicly in the captors' village, and the entire population (including children) watched and participated. Common torture techniques included burning the captive, which was done one hot coal at a time, rather than the Hollywood-style firewood pyres; cutting with knives, beatings with switches or sticks, and jabs from sharp sticks. Prisoners' fingernails were ripped out. Their fingers were broken, then twisted and yanked by children. Captives were made to eat pieces of their own flesh, and were scalped alive. To make the torture last longer, the Native Americans would revive captives with rest periods during which time they were given food and <b>water.</b> <b>Tortures</b> typically began on the lower limbs, then gradually spread to the arms, then the torso. The Native Americans spoke of [...] "caressing" [...] the prisoners gently at first, which meant that the initial tortures were designed to cause pain, but only minimal bodily harm. By these means, the execution of a captive, especially an adult male, could take several days and nights.|$|R

Houdini's will stipulated that all the effects should be [...] "burned and destroyed" [...] upon Hardeen's death. Hardeen sold much of the collection to magician and Houdini enthusiast Sidney Hollis Radner during the 1940s, including the <b>water</b> <b>torture</b> cell. Radner allowed choice pieces of the collection to be displayed at The Houdini Magical Hall of Fame in Niagara Falls, Ontario. In 1995, a fire destroyed the museum. The <b>water</b> <b>torture</b> cell's metal frame remained, and it was restored by illusion builder John Gaughan. Many of the props contained in the museum such as the mirror handcuffs, Houdini's original packing crate, a milk can, and a straitjacket, survived the fire and were auctioned in 1999 and 2008.|$|E
2500|$|Around 1912, {{the vast}} number of imitators {{prompted}} Houdini to replace his milk can act with the Chinese <b>water</b> <b>torture</b> cell. In this escape, Houdini's feet were locked in stocks, and he was lowered upside down into a tank filled with water. The mahogany and metal cell featured a glass front, through which audiences could clearly see Houdini. The stocks were locked {{to the top of}} the cell, and a curtain concealed his escape. In the earliest version of the torture cell, a metal cage was lowered into the cell, and Houdini was enclosed inside that. While making the escape more difficult – the cage prevented Houdini from turning – the cage bars also offered protection should the front glass break. The original cell was built in England, where Houdini first performed the escape for an audience of one person as part of a one-act play he called [...] "Houdini Upside Down". This was so he could copyright the effect and have grounds to sue imitators, which he did. While the escape was advertised as [...] "The Chinese <b>Water</b> <b>Torture</b> Cell" [...] or [...] "The <b>Water</b> <b>Torture</b> Cell", Houdini always referred to it as [...] "the Upside Down" [...] or [...] "USD". The first public performance of the USD was at the Circus Busch in Berlin, on September 21, 1912. Houdini continued to perform the escape until his death in 1926.|$|E
50|$|Tortures varied: detainees {{were forced}} to stay in uncomfortable {{positions}} („meditation position”) {{for long periods of}} time, sometimes for days on end, sitting up with hands extended, forced to eat hot food without a spoon; they had to drink salty water or made to eat feces or vomit and drink urine. During summer, some were kept with goggles over their eyes, wearing thick clothes and carrying heavy luggage, without <b>water.</b> Some <b>tortures</b> were only meant to humiliate, like having to blow into the light bulb to put it out; some were painted over their faces and made to dance for mockery.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Food and <b>water</b> deprivation-frequent <b>torture</b> methods {{occur for}} a variety of reasons. It may be used as a {{political}} tool or a method of self-harm. To the best of our knowledge, no solid data are available relating the long-term food deprivation and the eye lens, therefore this study aims to clue this relation if any. Rats were food deprived for one, three and six days. The lenses were enucleated where both lipids and proteins were extracted for the analysis. The data showed no specific changes in cholesterol, phospholipids and soluble lens protein contents; this is concomitant with changes in the thermal behavior of lens lipids. It may be concluded that the phase transition behavior and the different lipid microdomains play an essential role in the response of the lens to different food deprivation periods...|$|R
2500|$|In 1983, San Jacinto County, Texas sheriff, James Parker, {{and three}} of his deputies were convicted for conspiring to force confessions. The {{complaint}} said they [...] "subject prisoners to a suffocating <b>water</b> <b>torture</b> ordeal to coerce confessions. This generally included the placement of a towel over the nose and mouth of the prisoner and the pouring of water into the towel until the prisoner began to move, jerk (twitch), or otherwise indicate suffocation and/or drowning". James Parker was sentenced to ten years in prison, and the deputies to four years.|$|E
2500|$|A form {{of torture}} similar to {{waterboarding}} called toca, {{and more recently}} [...] "Spanish water torture", to differentiate it from the better known Chinese <b>water</b> <b>torture,</b> along with garrucha (or strappado) and {{the most frequently used}} potro (or the rack). This was used infrequently during the trial portion of the Spanish Inquisition process. [...] "The toca, also called tortura del agua, consisted of introducing a cloth into the mouth of the victim, and forcing them to ingest water spilled from a jar so that they had the impression of drowning". William Schweiker claims that the use of water as a form of torture also had profound religious significance to the Inquisitors.|$|E

40|$|Child abuse has {{probably}} existed {{as a social}} problem as long as parents and children have lived under the same roof, {{and in recent years}} it has received tremendous attention. Most of the research has focused on etiology rather than treatment, leaving large gaps in our knowledge about remediating abuse. Behavioral scientists have only begun to formulate a conceptual framework from which to work. Many theoretical questions are yet unanswered, particularly the question of what constitutes abuse. Burgess (1978) believes that conceptual problems exist because abuse falls along a continuum of parent-child relationships [...] a continuum that at one end might include verbal punishment (e. g., threats, ridicule) or milder forms of physical punishment (e. g., slap on the hand, spanking), and at the other end include extreme forms of physical punishment that exceed community mores (for example, hitting a child with a closed fist, scalding a child in hot <b>water,</b> <b>torturing</b> or killing a child). Thus, the question [...] where does discipline stop and abuse begin? [...] faces every researcher who must operationally define abuse. Identifying the consequences of abuse in a child's development is another area of inquiry that remains untreated. Most of the literature is filled with the subjective impressions of professionals speculating that abused children become the juvenile delinquents and the child abusers of the future; however, as yet no longitudinal studies have been conducted that compare the developmental outcomes of abused and non-abused children from early childhood to later adulthood. What if there were no differences? How might this influence our approaches to the treatment of abuse? Answers to these and other questions will take years of study. Increased awareness of the problem of child abuse has led to greater efforts to remediate the problem. Treatment efforts with abusive families are still in the initial stages, but, undoubtedly, information from these early programs can be the foundation for future researchers to formulate new, more effective intervention programs. Future researchers should focus on identifying those aspects of existing programs that lend themselves to empirical study and have led to more successful parent-child relationships...|$|R

60|$|Eub.--Yet, {{when all}} is done {{that can be done}} in the work of conservation, it is only {{producing}} a difference in the degree of duration. And from the statements that our friend has made it is evident that none of the works of a mortal being can be eternal, as none of the combinations of a limited intellect can be infinite. The operations of Nature, when slow, are no less sure; however man may for a time usurp dominion over her, she is certain of recovering her empire. He converts her rocks, her stones, her trees, into forms of palaces, houses, and ships; he employs the metals found in the bosom of the earth as instruments of power, and the sands and clays which constitute its surface as ornaments and resources of luxury; he imprisons air by <b>water,</b> and <b>tortures</b> <b>water</b> by fire to change or modify or destroy the natural forms of things. But, in some lustrums his works begin to change, and in a few centuries they decay and are in ruins; and his mighty temples, framed as it were for immortal and divine purposes, and his bridges formed of granite and ribbed with iron, and his walls for defence, and the splendid monuments by which he has endeavoured to give eternity even to his perishable remains, are gradually destroyed; and these structures, which have resisted the waves of the ocean, the tempests of the sky, and the stroke of the lightning, shall yield to the operation of the dews of heaven, of frost, rain, vapour, and imperceptible atmospheric influences; and, as the worm devours the lineaments of his mortal beauty, so the lichens and the moss and the most insignificant plants shall feed upon his columns and his pyramids, and the most humble and insignificant insects shall undermine and sap the foundations of his colossal works, and make their habitations amongst the ruins of his palaces and the falling seats of his earthly glory.|$|R
2500|$|The use of [...] "third degree interrogation" [...] {{techniques}} to compel confession, ranging from [...] "psychological duress such as prolonged confinement to extreme violence and torture", was widespread in early American policing. Lassiter classified the water cure as [...] "orchestrated physical abuse", {{and described the}} police technique as a [...] "modern day variation of the method of <b>water</b> <b>torture</b> that was popular during the Middle Ages". The technique employed by the police involved either holding the head in water until almost drowning, or laying {{on the back and}} forcing water into the mouth or nostrils. Such techniques were classified as [...] "'covert' third degree torture" [...] since they left no signs of physical abuse, and became popular after 1910 when the direct application of physical violence to force a confession became a media issue and some courts began to deny obviously compelled confessions. The publication of this information in 1931 as part of the Wickersham Commission's [...] "Report on Lawlessness in Law Enforcement" [...] led to a decline in the use of third degree police interrogation techniques in the 1930s and 1940s.|$|E
2500|$|During his {{recuperation}} {{from the}} knee injury, Ant {{had stayed in}} New York and Los Angeles and worked with Pirroni on writing new material. This and a further writing session with Pirroni in Paris in late May/early June {{formed the basis of}} Ant's second solo album Strip. [...] The album was recorded at Polar Studios in Stockholm in the late summer of 1983 with Phil Collins as both drummer and producer on both the title track and planned single Puss 'N Boots, with Richard James Burgess adopting the same roles for the non-single album tracks. The single [...] "Puss 'N Boots" [...] reached No.5 on the UK charts, but the BBC banned both the video and the song for the follow-up single [...] "Strip." [...] Despite a vocal cameo performance from former ABBA member Anni-Frid Lyngstad, [...] "Strip" [...] only managed to peak at No.41 before being withdrawn by CBS while the parent album barely scraped the UK Top 20. However, the Strip single fared quite well in America, only narrowly missing out on a US Top 40 hit single. [...] To promote the album, which reached No.65 on the Billboard Top 200 albums, in early 1984 Ant undertook another extensive US tour, some 60 dates in length, starting on 27 January 1984 at the Atlanta Civic Centre in Atlanta in Georgia and lasting until 27 April 1984 at the Irvine Meadow Amphitheatre in Laguna Hills, California. Although UK television performances of Puss N'Boots and Strip had featured a quartet of Ant, Pirroni, Wiczling and Constantinou, the US tour featured the same seven-piece backing band as the previous album's tour, except for Steve King in place of Stewart Van Blandamer on saxophone. The tour shows were also notable for featuring a recreation by Ant of the Chinese <b>Water</b> <b>Torture</b> Cell escapology stunt originally performed by Harry Houdini. [...] In preparation for this, in keeping with the album title, Ant undressed onstage down to a pair of boxer shorts.|$|E

5000|$|The real witch-hunt was not {{to break}} out in Sweden until 1668, but Småland {{was a bit of}} an exception, and it is {{believed}} that {{in the beginning of the}} 17th century there were several, though badly documented, witch trials in Småland that included both the ordeal by <b>water</b> and <b>torture.</b> The reason for this is considered to be the executioner Håkan, who was the official executioner of Jönköping between 1588 and 1638; he claimed to be an expert on this subject. It seems that he was educated abroad, learning about the ordeals by water, the devil's mark and the torture used in witch trials in other countries. In the first year of his employment, a woman who was set free from charges of sorcery, was threatened that if she was ever accused again, Håkan would expose her to the ordeal by water; two years later, he performed this test on two women in Jönköping - possibly the first time this method was used in Sweden - and in 1594, he was highly recommended for having exposed a woman called [...] "German-billa" [...] and making her admit to sorcery.|$|R
