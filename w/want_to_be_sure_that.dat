6000|$|... "My wishes {{have nothing}} to do with it," [...] said Dr. May. [...] "The point is--that I must do right, as far as I can, as well as try to secure your happiness; and I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> you know what you are about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Get on {{with your}} pot-boiler, and leave me alone, Allan," [...] I said. [...] "You do not {{understand}} my difficulties in the least. It is {{simply a matter of}} selection.

6000|$|The {{young fellow}} {{on the back}} seat quietly interposed. [...] "You <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> you've got the cinch on Cavanagh good and square, Sam, or he'll be a-ridin' you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am going," [...] he said, [...] "where {{there is}} just the {{possibility}} of an accident: one never knows. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> that all <b>was</b> well with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, we do much more. We are caretakers, {{watching}} {{over the whole}} world. The owners have left for a time, and we must see that the cities are kept clean, that decay is prevented, that everything is kept oiled and in running condition. The gardens, the streets, the water mains, everything must be maintained as it was eight years ago, {{so that when the}} owners return, they will not be displeased. We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> they will be completely satisfied." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{think some}} of you will fancy this almost too good news to be true, and yet the very news which you want to hear. I {{think some of}} you have been saying as you read this, [...] "All this is blessed and comforting news for poor fellows lying wounded in a hospital, or {{fretting}} their souls away about the wives and children they have left behind; blessed and comforting news; but we want something more than that even. We have to fight and to kill; we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> God's blessing is on our fighting and our killing; {{we have to go}} into battle; and we want to know that there, too, we are doing God's work, and to be sure that God is on our side." ...|$|E

I won't ask {{you to go back}} to the story of your past sufferings; I only <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> I am right about one thing--I mean about what happened at the time when the exploring party was dispatched in search of help. As I understand it, you cast lots among yourselves who was to go with the party, and who was to remain behind. Frank cast the lot to go." [...] She paused, shuddering. [...] "And Richard Wardour," [...] she went on, [...] "cast the lot to remain behind. On your honor, as officers and gentlemen, is this the truth?" ...|$|E

6000|$|A {{study of}} Mr. Ford's mental {{processes}} and acts illustrates the true mind of America. In {{the autumn of}} 1916 Mr. Wilson declared that [...] "the people of the United States {{want to be sure}} what they are fighting about, and they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> they are fighting for the things that will bring the world justice and peace. Define the elements; let us know that we are not fighting for the prevalence of this nation over that, for the ambitions of this group of nations as compared with the ambitions of that group of nations, let us once be convinced that we are called in to a great combination for the rights of mankind, and America will unite her force and spill her blood for the great things she has always believed in and followed." ...|$|E
5000|$|On September 1, 2005, CEO Ed Robertson of BMW Financial Services {{was quoted}} as saying, [...] "In light of the tragedy and {{destruction}} left {{in the wake of}} this natural disaster, we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> our customers affected by Katrina do not experience any additional anxiety over late or missed car payments. ...We will work with each and every one individually [...] - [...] customers with leases and retail contracts alike [...] - [...] to arrive at a suitable arrangement." ...|$|E
50|$|Judaism is not {{currently}} an openly proselytizing religion. Judaism teaches that the righteous {{of all nations}} {{have a place in}} the afterlife. Much like in the other Abrahamic faiths, Jewish law requires the sincerity of a potential convert, but takes it to a much more serious and formal level. In view of the foregoing considerations, most authorities are very careful about it. Essentially, they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> the convert knows what he is getting into, and that he is doing it for sincerely religious reasons. However, while conversion for the sake of love for Judaism is considered the best motivation, a conversion for the sake of avoiding intermarriage is gaining acceptance also.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Amedeo Giorgi applied phenomenological theory to his {{development}} of the Descriptive Phenomenological Method in Psychology in order to overcome certain problems he perceived, from his work in psychophysics, with approaching subjective phenomena from the traditional hypothetical-deductive framework of the natural sciences. Giorgi hoped to use what he had learned from his natural science background to develop a rigorous qualitative research method. Giorgi has thus described his overall project as such: [...] "psychology is nothing like natural sciences... because its sic with human experiences and human phenomena. However I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> our criteria is this: that every natural scientist will have to respect our method. I’m not just trying to satisfy clinicians, or therapists, or humanists, I’m trying to satisfy the most severe criterion — natural scientists... because I anticipate that some day, when qualitative research develops and gets strong, the natural science {{people are going to}} criticize it. And I {{want to be able to}} stand up and say, 'Go ahead, criticize it — but you won’t find any flaws here'." ...|$|E
5000|$|Throughout the book, {{they appear}} as both studiers and {{manipulators}} of humans, particularly Trystin Desoll. Upon attempts to force first contact, they (officially) destroyed one Coalition ship and many, many more rev ships trying to press into their systems. They are now {{engaged in a}} strange sort of alliance with the Coalition. It is not a military alliance, for the Farhkans clearly possess overwhelming power in that area. Nor is it a matter of cooperative technological research. Instead, {{they seem to have}} latched on to the Coalition as the most ethically [...] "advanced" [...] society of humanity, and therefore most worthy of assisting by sharing technology. They cannot just give out the technology immediately, however, instead sharing it in small portions here and there, and in exchange for seemingly strange and unimportant things. Particularly, they have been researching human biology and have been pestering {{men and women of the}} Coalition military about their ethics and the application of their skills and knowledge. They seem to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> the military, which stands to benefit most from Farhkan technology during a war, is composed of people with the wisdom and restraint to use the Farhkan tech carefully.|$|E
40|$|As consultants, {{we should}} be {{constantly}} trying to work ourselves out of a job. Unfortunately, it doesn’t always work out this way. Sometimes, our clients are stuck with a costly resource, a project that is never finished, and one that never quite meets their requirements. As clients, we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> when we engage a consultant we get the type of expertise we need {{and that we can}} (amicably) get rid of the consultant. In this paper, we will discuss both roles- consultant and client- and suggest ways to keep the relationship gourmet and not a food fight...|$|E
60|$|It amazed Kurt, presently, to {{note that}} dawn was at hand. He waited awhile longer, <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> not <b>to</b> meet any {{lingering}} members of the I.W.W. It appeared, indeed, that they had all gone.|$|R

40|$|Reliable {{authentication}} and authorisation {{are crucial}} for both service providers and their customers, where the former {{want to protect}} their resources from unauthorised access and fraudulent use while their customers <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> unauthorised access to their data is prevented. In Grid environments Virtual Organisations (VO) have been adopted {{as a means to}} organise and control access to resources and data based on roles that are assigned to users. Moreover, attribute based authorisation has emerged providing a decentralised approach with better scalability. Up to now UNICORE authentication and authorisation is based on X. 509 -certificates only. In this master thesis we will present two implementational solutions to integrate both role or attribute based authorisation using VOMS and attribute based authorisation using Shibboleth into UNICORE...|$|E
40|$|Fourthly, {{the tragic}} {{situations}} under debate are, fortunately, rare. Yet they cause tremendous turmoil and moral agony. The neonatologist {{who told me}} 'we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> we {{did the right thing}} ' expressed a need for moral confirmation of a medical decision. Debriefing of entire teams after the event may be helpful. However, reinforcement of the decision before its implementation could prevent the need for such debriefing. Campbell is right when he says that 'to apply modern treatments indiscriminately [...] . would be irresponsible' (page 571). Yet, since discernment displayed in current decisions has come more than once under heavy fire, the reasonable thing seems to be to mobilise those moral forces before deciding, rather than facing them after the facts...|$|E
40|$|Clients of storage-as-a-service {{systems such}} as Amazon’s S 3 <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> the files they have {{entrusted}} to the cloud are available now and {{will be available in}} the future. Using protocols from previous work on proofs of retrievability and on provable data possession, clients can verify that their files are available now. But these protocols do not guarantee that the files are replicated onto multiple drives or multiple datacenters. Such tests are crucial if cloud storage is to provide resilience to natural disasters and power outages as well as improving the network latency to different parts of the world. In this paper, we study the problem of verifying that a cloud storage provider replicates the data in diverse geolocations. We provide a theoretical framework for verifyin...|$|E
