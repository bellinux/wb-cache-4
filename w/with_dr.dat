Eight years later, Barry has become a violent patient in a mental institution, refusing to take his medication and insisting that the aliens are coming back for him. He attacks a security guard and steals his gun, taking head psychiatrist Dr. Hakkie hostage before escaping. Barry seeks to return to his original abduction site <b>with</b> <b>Dr.</b> Hakkie, in the hopes that the aliens will take the doctor instead when they return. But since he can't remember where the abduction site is located, Barry heads to a travel agency in Richmond and holds the three clerks hostage along <b>with</b> <b>Dr.</b> Hakkie.|$|E

40|$|Flippases (type 4 P-type ATPases) are {{believed}} to translocate phospholipids from the exoplasmic to the cytoplasmic leaflet in bilayer membranes. Since flippases are structurally similar to ion-transporting P-type ATPases such as the Ca 2 + ATPase, one important question is how flippases have evolved to transport phospholipids instead of ions. We previously showed that a conserved membrane protein, Cdc 50 p, {{is required for the}} ER exit of the Drs 2 p flippase in yeast. However, Cdc 50 p is still associated <b>with</b> <b>Drs</b> 2 p after its transport to the endosomal/TGN membranes, and its function in the complex <b>with</b> <b>Drs</b> 2 p is unknown. In this study, we isolated novel temperature-sensitive (ts) cdc 50 mutants whose products were still localized to endosomal/TGN compartments at the non-permissive temperature. Mutant Cdc 50 proteins colocalized <b>with</b> <b>Drs</b> 2 p in endosomal/TGN compartments, and they co-immunoprecipitated <b>with</b> <b>Drs</b> 2 p. These cdc 50 -ts mutants exhibited defects in vesicle transport from early endosomes to the TGN as the cdc 50 deletion mutant did. These results suggest that mutant Cdc 50 proteins could be complexed <b>with</b> <b>Drs</b> 2 p, but the resulting Cdc 50 p-Drs 2 p complex is functionally defective at the non-permissive temperature. Cdc 50 p may play an important role for phospholipid translocation by Drs 2 p...|$|R
