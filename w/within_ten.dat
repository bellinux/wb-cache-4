5|$|Acquired {{immunodeficiency}} syndrome (AIDS) {{is defined}} in terms of either a CD4+ T cell count below 200 cells per µL or the occurrence of specific diseases in association with an HIV infection. In the absence of specific treatment, around half of people infected with HIV develop AIDS <b>within</b> <b>ten</b> years. The most common initial conditions that alert to the presence of AIDS are pneumocystis pneumonia (40%), cachexia in the form of HIV wasting syndrome (20%), and esophageal candidiasis. Other common signs include recurring respiratory tract infections.|$|E

5|$|Lance Corporal Jose Francisco Jimenez (1946–1969) was {{assigned}} to Company K, 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines, 1st Marine Division. On August 28, 1969, his unit came under heavy attack by North Vietnamese Army soldiers concealed in well-camouflaged emplacements at Quang Nam Province. Jimenez personally destroyed several enemy personnel and silenced an antiaircraft weapon. He then maneuvered to <b>within</b> <b>ten</b> feet of hostile soldiers who were firing automatic weapons from a trench and, {{in the face of}} vicious enemy fire, destroyed the position. As he moved to attack another enemy soldier, he was mortally wounded.|$|E

40|$|In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) {{with three}} generations of fermions, there is a {{stringent}} upper bound on {{the mass of the}} lightest neutral Higgs h, and the mass of the charged Higgs H^+, must be close (<b>within</b> <b>tens</b> of GeV) to the heavier neutral Higgs, H, and the pseudoscalar Higgs A. In this Brief Report, we show that in the four generation MSSM, the upper bound on the h mass is much higher, as high as 400 GeV, and H^+ is generally much heavier than the A, allowing the H^+ -> A W^+ decay, potentially changing search strategies for both the charged Higgs and the pseudoscalar. The H mass, on the other hand, remains <b>within</b> <b>tens</b> of GeV of the charged Higgs mass. Comment: 4 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

5|$|<b>Within</b> <b>ten</b> years, {{another case}} arose, which dealt with fishing rights at Celilo Falls, a {{traditional}} Indian fishing location. Two brothers, Lineas and Audubon Winans, owned property {{on both sides}} of the Columbia River and obtained licenses from the state of Washington to operate four fish wheels. The wheels prevented a significant number of salmon from passing the location. Additionally, the Winans prohibited anyone, whether an Indian with treaty rights or otherwise, from crossing their land to get to the falls.|$|E
5|$|After {{the hostage}} {{exchange}} is agreed, Troilus suggests elopement, but Cressida argues {{that he should}} not abandon Troy and that she should protect her honour. Instead, she promises to meet him <b>within</b> <b>ten</b> days. Troilus spends much of the intervening time on the city walls, sighing in the direction where Cressida has gone. No horses or sleeves, as used by Guido or Benoît, are involved in Troilus' learning of Cressida's change of heart. Instead a dream hints at what has happened, and then the truth is confirmed when a brooch – previously a gift from Troilus to Cressida – is found on Diomedes' looted clothing. In the mean time, Cressida has kept up the pretence in their correspondence that she still loves Troilus. After Cressida's betrayal is confirmed, Troilus becomes ever fiercer in battle.|$|E

5|$|Anheuser-Busch still {{operate a}} large-production brewery in Newark, {{originally}} opened in 1951, {{which is used}} for brewing Budweiser and Rolling Rock. New Jersey offers a limited brewery license for microbreweries and a restricted brewery license for brewpubs.

5|$|As dawn {{broke and}} {{visibility}} cleared, the sailors on Ceylon, Vénus and Victor realised {{that they were}} within sight of Saint Denis on Île Bourbon, and thus vulnerable to counterattack from Rowley's flagship Boadicea. Despite hasty repairs, neither Ceylon nor Vénus were seaworthy by 07:30, when British lookouts on the island spotted the three ships and sent word to Rowley. <b>Within</b> <b>ten</b> minutes, Rowley was at sea, taking 50 volunteers from Africaine to augment his crew. Hamelin made desperate efforts to limp back to Île de France, ordering Victor to tow Ceylon, but progress was slow and strong winds, which did not help the dismasted Ceylon and Vénus, repeatedly broke the tow rope.|$|E

5|$|Despite the storm's extreme intensity, {{it quickly}} began to weaken as it {{approached}} the Philippines on October 6. <b>Within</b> <b>ten</b> hours, the pressure rose to 894 mb (hPa; 26.40 inHg) and later dropped below Category 5 status. That morning, Nora turned more northwesterly {{in response to}} a weakening in a subtropical ridge and an approaching shortwave trough over China. Steady weakening continued over the following days, with the storm brushing the northeastern tip of Luzon, Philippines, with winds of 175ndash&185 km/h (110ndash&115 mph) on October 7. Nora's intensity leveled out around 130 km/h (80 mph) on October 8 as it tracked between the Philippines and Taiwan. After passing within 95 km (60 mi) of Taiwan, Nora turned more northerly before making landfall near Xiamen, Fujian as a minimal typhoon early on October 10. Once onshore, the storm rapidly degenerated into an area of low pressure before dissipating the following day.|$|E
5|$|Development of an endometrial {{hyperplasia}} (overgrowth of endometrial cells) is {{a significant}} risk factor because hyperplasias can and often do develop into adenocarcinoma, though cancer can develop without {{the presence of a}} hyperplasia. <b>Within</b> <b>ten</b> years, 8–30% of atypical endometrial hyperplasias develop into cancer, whereas 1–3% of non-atypical hyperplasias do so. An atypical hyperplasia is one with visible abnormalities in the nuclei. Pre-cancerous endometrial hyperplasias are also referred to as endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia. Mutations in the KRAS gene can cause endometrial hyperplasia and therefore Type I endometrial cancer. Endometrial hyperplasia typically occurs after the age of 40. Endometrial glandular dysplasia occurs with an overexpression of p53, and develops into a serous carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|During the day, Boadicea {{continued}} to close until Victor {{was forced to}} abandon Ceylon and sail in support of Vénus at 15:30. As soon as the French prize crew was removed, Lieutenant Philip Fitz Gibbon, the remaining officer on Ceylon, rehoisted British colours and assumed control of the ship. This allowed Boadicea to sail past the recaptured frigate and engage the French ships directly, reaching Vénus at 16:40. Hamelin recognised that the battered state of his flagship meant {{that he would not}} be able to adequately defend against Rowley's attack and ordered Victor to take news of his defeat back to Port Napoleon.
