5|$|I think, {{and this}} is now with some {{distance}} in listening to the records, but {{on the outside looking}} in with all earnestness I think Soundgarden made the best records out of that scene. I think we were the most daring and experimental and genre-pushing really and I'm really proud of it. And I guess that's why I have trepidation about the idea of re-forming. I don't know what it would mean, or I guess I just have this image of <b>who</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> and I had probably a lot of anxiety during the period of being Soundgarden, as we all did, that it was responsibility and it was an important band and music and we didn't want to mess it up and we managed to not, which I feel is a great achievement.|$|E
5|$|The {{island is}} ruled {{over by a}} king. His name is Epatiana. He is a large, ignorant-looking boy of about 18 summers, {{and is one of}} the worst rowdies on the island, and there is no power to touch him. The first time we met him he was just landing from an {{excursion}} trip to the island of Rimatara, near by. And you need not be told that I was surprised when told that he was the king of the island; for instead of being dressed in a garb of rich apparel of some kind, with a crown about his head, as I had expected, he had nothing whatever on to indicate his supreme power. His costume was composed of a red breech-clout, a red woolen shirt and upon his bare head an old dried up wreath of faded flowers, such as is worn by all rowdies. When we spoke to him about his island, he dropped his head, as he sat upon the sand, and blushingly answered us. We told him <b>who</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> and where we were from, saluted him and left him with very different ideas formed about the king of Rurutu, than we had before meeting him. This was the first monarch of the kind I ever saw, and the first time we were ever under the reign of a king. The island is under the French protection, still it regulates and governs its own affairs, and the French have nothing to say in that respect. The king has judges under him, who make the laws and enforce them while he is in his childhood days.|$|E

The composition {{was influenced by the}} electropop of underground bands in Los Angeles, whose sound The Veronicas were keen to incorporate into their own music. Jessica explained the lyrical content and central theme behind [...] "Hook Me Up": [...] "It's about being tired with where you're at in life and wanting to get away and out for {{just a little bit of}} time-whether it's in a relationship or in life. I guess we went through that a little bit when things started getting full on with us. It went from one extreme, where no one knew <b>who</b> <b>we</b> <b>were,</b> to the complete opposite".|$|E

[...] "After years of hard work, promotion, and nonstop touring, people knew <b>who</b> <b>we</b> <b>were,</b> and listened to what we were saying... it scared {{the shit out of}} us."

Reports by Turkish police confirmed this, stating that Lyashenko had left a suicide note and attempted to cut his arms and wrists before hanging himself. A Turkish police officer, speaking anonymously, said that Lyashenko apologized for killing himself in the note. New York Rangers general manager Glen Sather said of Lyashenko, [...] "Roman was a quality individual who had a positive impact on everyone he touched, {{both on and off the}} ice."

500|$|During {{the first}} half of its first season, Fringe staff and critics noted that the series was still trying to define itself and its characters. The writers worked on {{balancing}} serialized storytelling with standalone plots and had to contend with continuous rewrites and expensive last-minute reshoots. For them, [...] "Safe" [...] marked {{a turning point in the}} series. They turned David Robert Jones into a recurring character and began to give Olivia more of a personal life. Actor Lance Reddick, who portrays Agent Broyles, later explained in an interview how important the episode was to the evolution of the series, [...] "We found <b>who</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> in episode 10, the episode where Olivia got kidnapped... We were trying to hedge our bets and trying to be too many kinds of shows at once. I'm not saying we got rid of the procedural element because each episode still is on a case – a case in terms of the quote-unquote police work — but it's not formulaic, not like the early episodes.

500|$|By {{the fifth}} Test, the Australian team {{was in sight}} {{of being the first}} Australian team to remain unbeaten {{throughout}} a tour of England. [...] Once again, much of the first day was lost to rain. Determined not to lose, Armstrong attempted to delay commencement after the rain and was heckled by English supporters. [...] He told his three main bowlers, [...] "I won't ask you not to get a man out, but as long as Mead (a notoriously slow scoring batsman) remains at the wicket we can't be beaten". [...] In the last three hours of the Test, Armstrong decided to rest his key bowlers and allowed his part-time bowlers to rotate as they pleased and fielders to configure themselves. During this time, Armstrong picked up a newspaper that had been blown across the field and began to read. [...] When asked about this later, Armstrong was said to have replied, [...] "I wanted to see <b>who</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> playing", although this is claimed to be apocryphal. [...] The Australians drew the Test and won the series three–nil, however they could not maintain their unbeaten record, losing by 28runs to an English XI at Eastbourne and again to C. I. Thornton's XI at Scarborough.|$|E
500|$|Although xx {{had been}} highly {{anticipated}} by XL, the album's success exceeded expectations in the press. McDonald said their direction and sound {{would have been}} entirely different had expectations been higher. Croft was [...] "baffled" [...] by the acclaim given to what she viewed as an album they had made [...] "for themselves". Sim had mixed feelings about its success and believed it could affect his songwriting in the future: [...] "This album was done with no expectations. No one knew <b>who</b> <b>we</b> <b>were.</b> When I was writing the songs, I didn't think anyone other than Romy or James would ever actually hear them. Now I know so many people will. I might feel I {{have to be a}} bit more private." [...] At the Mercury Prize ceremony, he said the time since its release has [...] "felt like a haze", but that the event serves as [...] "a moment of clarity". In their acceptance speech, the band announced they would use the £20,000 prize money to build their own studio, where they subsequently wrote and recorded their second album Coexist. When Coexist debuted in September 2012, xx was still on the British chart at number 37 and had sold 446,734 copies in the UK. The following year, it was ranked number 237 on NMEs list of the top 500 albums of all time and named the 74th greatest debut record by Rolling Stone, who found its music radical as [...] "an exercise in restraint, in the artful use of space and silence" [...] during popular music's period of maximalism.|$|E

[...] "Get Sexy", which was selected as the album's lead single, was written by Fred Fairbrass, Richard Fairbrass, Rob Manzoli, Philip Lawrence, Ari Levine, Bruno Mars and produced by the latter three under their stage name The Smeezingtons. Working with The Smeezingtons was described by group member Amelle Berrabah as an [...] "amazing" [...] and [...] "great opportunity". Berrabah also stated in an interview with Bang Showbiz that the song [...] "doesn't sound like anything we have ever done before". On 6 July 2009, Sugababes announced the release date of [...] "Get Sexy" [...] as 31 August 2009. The song premiered on BBC Radio 1 on 7 July 2009 in a show presented by Scott Mills. In an interview for Digital Spy, Buchanan said that the response to the song was great, saying: [...] "From the beginning there's been a real buzz about the track. It's had a great response from so many people, even if they say, 'Forget about the rest of them, this one I love'." [...] Later, on 27 September 2013, Keisha Buchanan said of the Bruno Mars penned song that, [...] "I just didn't feel like that was a representation of <b>who</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> as a band but we didn't, at that point, have a lot of say."

40|$|Knowing <b>who</b> <b>we</b> <b>are,</b> {{and where}} <b>we</b> <b>are,</b> are two {{fundamental}} {{aspects of our}} physical and mental experience. Although the domains of spatial and social cognition are often studied independently, a few recent areas of scholarship have explored the interactions of place and self. This fits in with increasing evidence for embodied theories of cognition, where mental processes are grounded in action and perception. <b>Who</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> might be integrated with where <b>we</b> <b>are,</b> and impact how we move through space. Individuals vary in personality, navigational strategies, and numerous cognitive and social competencies. Here we review the relation between social and spatial spheres of existence in the realms of philosophical considerations, neural and psychological representations, and evolutionary context, and how we might use the built environment to suit <b>who</b> <b>we</b> <b>are,</b> or how it creates <b>who</b> <b>we</b> <b>are.</b> In particular <b>we</b> investigate how two spatial reference frames, egocentric and allocentric, might transcend into the social realm.

2500|$|Switchfoot {{was founded}} in 1996 as Chin Up, {{consisting}} of Jon Foreman and his brother Tim, along with Chad Butler on drums. After playing only a few shows, the band was contacted by music industry veteran Charlie Peacock and eventually signed to his indie label [...] under the current moniker, Switchfoot. Re:think went on to distribute the first three Switchfoot albums, The Legend of Chin, New Way to Be Human, and Learning to Breathe. Because Re:think was bought out by Christian giant Sparrow Records before Switchfoot's first release, however, the band's and Peacock's intentions of being marketed outside of the Contemporary Christian music scene and reaching a wider audience were put on hold. Consequently, the band was mostly marketed to Christian radio and retail outlets early in their careers, a time Jon Foreman has described as when [...] "half of <b>who</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> was lost." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a stark {{contrast}} to his previous films, Shyamalan's name was notably absent from trailers, TV commercials, and marketing signage.

Sony's worldwide marketing and distribution chairman, Jeff Blake, said that [...] "Night is, without a doubt, a world-class filmmaker <b>who</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> thrilled to team up with on this project," [...] but [...] "Together, we decided to focus our campaign on both the action and Will and Jaden given that 'After Earth' is an adventure story of a father and son." [...] Alex Suskind of Moviefone pointed out to Shyamalan that After Earth was not being marketed on the strength of his name unlike his previous projects, to which he responded, [...] "There's such a specific expectation that comes with a name.

[...] Human-rights activists and Palestinians say that the demolitions had also been accompanied by gunﬁre from Israeli snipers. The director of Rafah's hospital, Dr. Ali Moussa said that 240 Palestinians, including 78 children, had been killed since the Al-Aqsa Intifada began in 2001, [...] "Every night there is shooting at houses in which children are sleeping, without any attacks from Palestinians."

We were lulled into {{a false sense of security}} and yet, on the day, we were also intimidated because we didn't play our natural game, preferring instead to sit back and wait for them to come at us. Also, we didn't kick well that day, particularly Michael Lynagh. I hardly saw the ball, and when I did I was clobbered. Not feeling the ball in my hands destroys me anyway; I cannot take it. That day we were more afraid of making a mistake, worrying about <b>who</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> playing against, rather than getting on with our own game.
