40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} meteorological surface and aerological observations at Syowa Station from February 10, 1973 to January 31, 1974. The main subjects of observations, the method, and the equipments {{are the same as}} the previous year. Observed results were regularly sent to <b>World</b> <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Centre</b> in Melbourne via Mawson Station. Some meteorological characteristics of this year are as follows: 1) A long spell of blizzard {{in the first decade of}} April had daily maximum wind speeds exceeding 20 m/s recorded every day for 10 consecutive days. 2) On the early morning of 12 May, air temperature rose up to 1. 4 ℃. This was the highest record for May since observation started at Syowa Station. 3) Gold weather in July and August brought monthly mean temperatures for July and August to the lowest ever observed at Syowa Station. 4) The rate of actual sunshine duration to the possible sunshine in November was 71 %. This value was the largest number for this month at Syowa Station. 5) Sudden warming in the lower stratosphere was observed quasiperiodicaly from early September. A temperature rise in the warming period from 30 October to 6 November was about 30 ℃ at 30 mb pressure level...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} meteorological surface and aerological observations at Syowa Station from February 1, 1972 to February 10, 1973. The main subjects of observations, the method, and the equipments {{are the same as}} the previous year. Observed results (surface observation at 00, 06, 09, 12, 15, 18 GMT and aerological observation at 00 GMT) were sent to <b>World</b> <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Centre</b> in Melbourne via Mawson Station based on the WMO code, and were recorded according to the WMO regulations. Meteorological characters observed this year are as follows: 1) Temperature {{in the first half of}} this year was a little lower than the average but was unusualy high in August and September. 2) Snow accumulation in August and September was larger than in normal years, 3) The sunshine duration in the latter half was extremely shorter than in normal years, arid consequently, the thawing of snow was very slow. 4) Sudden warming in the lowci stratosphere was observed clearly since October 8. For instance, the isotherm of - 50 ℃ was found to shift downward periodically, with a period of 11 or 12 days. 5) A rainbow was observed on the early moring of December 17. 1972. This was the first recoid ever since Syowa Station was opened. Moreover, we carried out observations of drifting snow, total amount of ozone, amount of evaporation, katabatic wind as well as atmospheric ozone, electricity and long wave radiation using a specially desinged radiosonde...|$|R
