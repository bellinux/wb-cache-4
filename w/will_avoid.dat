5|$|Dependent stage – At this stage, {{symptoms}} {{build up}} gradually. Hangover symptoms from excessive drinking may {{be confused with}} withdrawal symptoms. Many addicts will maintain their drinking to avoid withdrawal sickness, drinking small amounts frequently.

5|$|Foxes can {{be found}} only at the fringes of jackal territory. Red foxes and golden jackals share similar diets, with the jackal being three times bigger than the red fox. The red fox <b>will</b> <b>avoid</b> close {{proximity}} with jackals, and fox populations decrease where jackals are abundant. Striped hyenas prey on golden jackals, and three jackal carcasses were found in one hyena den.|$|E
5|$|Although fishers are {{competent}} tree climbers, {{they spend}} most of their time on the forest floor and prefer continuous forest to other habitats. Fishers have been found in extensive conifer forests typical of the boreal forest but are also common in mixed hardwood and conifer forests. Fishers prefer areas with continuous overhead cover with greater than 80% coverage and <b>will</b> <b>avoid</b> areas with less than 50% coverage. Fishers are more likely to be found in old-growth forests. Since female fishers require moderately large trees for denning, forests that have been heavily logged and have extensive second growth appears to be unsuitable for their needs.|$|E
5|$|Complex nests {{are built}} by many ant species, but other species are nomadic {{and do not}} build {{permanent}} structures. Ants may form subterranean nests or build them on trees. These nests {{may be found in}} the ground, under stones or logs, inside logs, hollow stems, or even acorns. The materials used for construction include soil and plant matter, and ants carefully select their nest sites; Temnothorax albipennis <b>will</b> <b>avoid</b> sites with dead ants, as these may indicate the presence of pests or disease. They are quick to abandon established nests {{at the first sign of}} threats.|$|E

5|$|An infant with an anxious-avoidant {{pattern of}} {{attachment}} <b>will</b> <b>avoid</b> or ignore the caregiver—showing little emotion when the caregiver departs or returns. The infant will not explore very much {{regardless of who}} is there. Infants classified as anxious-avoidant (A) represented a puzzle in the early 1970s. They did not exhibit distress on separation, and either ignored the caregiver on their return (A1 subtype) or showed some tendency to approach together with some tendency to ignore or {{turn away from the}} caregiver (A2 subtype). Ainsworth and Bell theorized that the apparently unruffled behaviour of the avoidant infants was in fact a mask for distress, a hypothesis later evidenced through studies of the heart-rate of avoidant infants.|$|E
5|$|Believing Joshua {{will attempt}} another {{break-in}} but <b>will</b> <b>avoid</b> putting innocents in danger, Olivia has Fringe Division statistician Astrid identify three remotely located banks {{and decides to}} investigate them. Olivia finds the bank that Joshua has targeted and discovers his device in a subway tunnel, but he knocks her out before she can investigate further. As he energizes the molecular destabilizer, Fringe Division detects the event and converges on the bank. Matthew eventually finds Joshua, again trying to warn him off, but quickly realizes Joshua has purposely entered the bank to be trapped in the amber. Joshua believes {{this to be the}} only way to force the Fringe team to end their investigation. Matthew escapes the quarantine while Fringe agents Charlie and Lincoln rescue Olivia in time before the amber sets in. Olivia returns to Matthew the next day and confirms the case is closed, but not before collecting a skin sample that, should she ever need it, conclusively proves that it was Matthew in the amber before.|$|E
5|$|In Batesian mimicry, {{the mimic}} {{effectively}} copies the coloration of an aposematic animal, {{known as the}} model, to deceive predators into behaving {{as if it were}} distasteful. The success of this dishonest display depends on the level of toxicity of the model and the abundance of the model in the geographical area. The more toxic the model is, {{the more likely it is}} that the predator <b>will</b> <b>avoid</b> the mimic. The abundance of the model species is also important for the success of the mimic because of frequency dependent selection. When the model is abundant, mimics with imperfect model patterns or slightly different coloration from the model are still avoided by predators. This is because the predator has a strong incentive to avoid potentially lethal organisms, given the likelihood of encountering one. However, in areas where the model is scarce or locally extinct, mimics are driven to accurate aposematic coloration. This is because predators attack imperfect mimics more readily where there is little chance that they are the model species. Frequency dependent selection may also have driven Batesian mimics to become polymorphic in rare cases where a single genetic switch controls appearance, as in the swallowtail butterflies (the Papilionidae).|$|E

5|$|After a varying {{amount of}} {{training}} (at {{least a few}} months), apprentices are eventually made warriors. Another naming ceremony is held, this time to mark the cat as being a full member of the Clan. Warriors are given their own unique suffix that often marks their personality or appearance; for example, ‘Graystripe’ would be named after the grey stripe running down his back, ‘Brokentail’ after the kink in his tail, and ‘Sandstorm’ after her fiery personality. It is extremely rare for warriors to meet another cat with the exact same name, but often a warrior will meet another cat with the same first part of their name, and very often will a warrior meet another cat with the same last part of their name (such as fur, tail, or heart). Once named, warriors hold a vigil at night to protect the clan, {{while the rest of}} the clan is sleeping. After the vigil, warriors are free to move into the warrior’s den, where the majority of the Clan sleeps. The duty of a warrior is to protect and uphold their Clan at all costs. They are able to hunt by themselves, and are generally skilled at defending themselves in battle. Warriors can take a mate, and females can give birth to new kits; if this occurs, the expecting mother, known as a 'queen', <b>will</b> <b>avoid</b> warrior duties for six months before returning to them once her kits are made apprentices. The vast majority of warriors are also chosen to later be mentors to new apprentices. Warriors will remain in this position for the remainder of their life, or until they are old enough to retire.|$|E

5000|$|The Ajivika {{tradition}} combined Saṃsāra {{with the}} premise {{that there is no}} free will, while the Jainism tradition accepted the concept of soul (calling it [...] "jiva") with free will, but emphasized asceticism and cessation of action as a means of liberation from Saṃsāra it calls bondage. The various sub-traditions of Hinduism, and of Buddhism, accepted free <b>will,</b> <b>avoided</b> asceticism, accepted renunciation and monastic life, and developed their own ideas on liberation through realization of the true nature of existence.|$|R

Most patients <b>will</b> <b>avoid</b> discussing pain for many reasons, so this will require logical thinking or communication skills to assess. In advanced lymphedema, there may be the presence of skin changes such as discoloration, verrucous (wart-like) hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis, papillomatosis, and Ulcer (dermatology).|$|E

To avoid tooling costs associated with these components, most manufacturers then tended to design their receivers around a fixed range of frequencies offered, {{which resulted in a}} worldwide de facto standardization of intermediate frequencies.|$|E

Businesses are regularly taken to court for tax evasion. Revenue claim a business will be audited roughly every seven years.|$|E
25|$|If FID forces {{take part}} in combat, one of their first {{activities}} tends to be teaching HN personnel how to call for close air support and artillery fires. The actual fire may come from HN or FID resources, or a combination. One {{of the reasons that}} fire direction is a priority is that experienced FID personnel <b>will</b> <b>avoid</b> firing at unknown targets, or firing at insurgents using civilian shields. Free-fire zones, such as used in Vietnam, can produce new insurgents faster than killing old ones.|$|E
25|$|Steering a ship {{effectively}} requires skills {{gained through}} training and experience. An expert helmsman has {{a keen sense}} of how a particular ship will respond to the helm or how different sea conditions impact steering. For instance, experience teaches a helmsman the ability to correct the rudder in advance of a ship substantially falling off course. This requires the capacity to anticipate the delay between when the helm is applied and when the ship responds to the rudder. Similarly, a skilled helmsman <b>will</b> <b>avoid</b> overcompensating for a ship's movement caused by local conditions, such as wind, swells, currents, or rough seas.|$|E
