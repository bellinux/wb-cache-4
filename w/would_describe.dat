5|$|Denning's {{oldest brother}} Jack was killed near Gueudecourt in 1916. His brother Gordon, who saw {{action in the}} Battle of Jutland, died of {{tuberculosis}} contracted during his Navy service. Denning <b>would</b> <b>describe</b> his dead brothers as the best {{of him and his}} siblings.|$|E
5|$|A {{description}} of thought content <b>would</b> <b>describe</b> a patient's delusions, overvalued ideas, obsessions, phobias and preoccupations. Abnormalities of thought content are established by exploring individuals' thoughts in an open-ended conversational manner {{with regard to}} their intensity, salience, the emotions associated with the thoughts, {{the extent to which the}} thoughts are experienced as one's own and under one's control, and the degree of belief or conviction associated with the thoughts.|$|E
5|$|As a {{technology}} showcase, Valve considered Lost Coast {{to have very}} demanding system requirements. The game runs on computers with specifications lower than what is recommended, albeit without some key features such as high dynamic range. If a non-high-dynamic-range-capable card is used, the developer commentary is changed slightly to reflect this. For example, Valve president Gabe Newell <b>would</b> <b>describe</b> the effects that are seen in a different manner.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the conceptual framework several additional factors enabled the GWA studies. One was the advent of biobanks, which are repositories of human genetic material that greatly reduced the cost and difficulty of collecting sufficient numbers of biological specimens for study. Another was the International HapMap Project, which, from 2003 identified {{a majority of the}} common SNPs interrogated in a GWA study. The haploblock structure identified by HapMap project also allowed the focus on the subset of SNPs that <b>would</b> <b>describe</b> most of the variation. Also the development of the methods to genotype all these SNPs using genotyping arrays was an important prerequisite.|$|E
5|$|My main character, {{the deputy}} head, is a manic git, and he's {{based on a}} guy I never {{actually}} met and is therefore being denigrated terribly. He had already retired by the time I started but I used to get a lift to work from his wife, who still worked there. And she would tell me stories about him with the affectionate disdain of {{anyone who has been}} married for more than a year. In the staff room, all these bitter teachers who hadn't been promoted <b>would</b> <b>describe</b> him as someone who would only briefly consider stopping short of invading Poland if he got the chance. I've since found out that the real man is actually a very nice bloke.|$|E
25|$|A {{valence bond}} theory {{approach}} considering just s and p orbitals <b>would</b> <b>describe</b> the bonding {{in terms of}} resonance between two resonance structures.|$|E

40|$|Several {{points of}} view may be taken {{if we want to}} {{describe}} a dairy farm. An animal nutritionist would focus on the individual animal and describe how feeds are transformed to meat, bones, tissues, skin, hair, embryos, milk, manure etc. A physiologist <b>would</b> further <b>describe</b> the roles of the various organs in this process and how the transformations are regulated by hormones. A biochemist <b>would</b> even <b>describe</b> the basic processes at molecular level...|$|R
25|$|The Schrödinger {{equation}} {{was developed}} principally from the De Broglie hypothesis, a wave equation that <b>would</b> <b>describe</b> particles, {{and can be}} constructed as shown informally in the following sections. For a more rigorous description of Schrödinger's equation, see also Resnick et al.|$|E
25|$|Ajaan Mun and Ajaan Lee <b>would</b> <b>describe</b> {{obstacles}} that commonly occurred in meditation {{but would not}} explain how to get through them, forcing students {{to come up with}} solutions on their own. Additionally, they were generally very private about their own meditative attainments.|$|E
25|$|Autobiographical {{elaboration}} {{is known}} to benefit memory by creating links between the processed stimuli, and the self, for example, deciding whether a word <b>would</b> <b>describe</b> the personal self. Memory formed through autobiographical elaboration is enhanced as compared to items processed for meaning, but not {{in relation to the}} self.|$|E
40|$|Abstract One of {{important}} periods in Indonesian history is physical revolution that’s known as freedom war. The result is change of statecraft on Indonesia. Bases on UUD’ 45 as constitution of state, Indonesia use unity state formation. But, periods Indonesia {{had to use}} federal state formation. These article <b>would</b> <b>described</b> change of state formation from federal back to unity state formation in middle of 1950. Key words: State formation, federal, and unity. ...|$|R
5000|$|In this episode, George {{claims to}} know the best public toilets {{anywhere}} in Manhattan. In the seventh season of Curb Your Enthusiasm, Larry has written the reunion so that George has parlayed this knowledge into an iPhone app called [...] "iToilet" [...] which the fictionalized version of Jerry <b>would</b> <b>described</b> as [...] "An iphone application that leads you via your GPS to the nearest acceptable toilet wherever {{you are in the}} world".|$|R

25|$|Consider {{the case}} of an {{observer}} and a light source moving relative to each other at constant velocity, with a light beam moving from the source to the observer. At the moment of emission, the beam in the observer's rest frame is tilted compared to the one in the source's rest frame, as understood through relativistic beaming. During the time it takes the light beam to reach the observer the light source moves in the observer's frame, and the 'true position' of the light source is displaced relative to the apparent position the observer sees, as explained by light-time correction. Finally, the beam in the observer's frame at the moment of observation is tilted compared to the beam in source's frame, which can be understood as an aberrational effect. Thus, a person in the light source's frame <b>would</b> <b>describe</b> the apparent tilting of the beam in terms of aberration, while a person in the observer's frame <b>would</b> <b>describe</b> it as a light-time effect.|$|E
25|$|The Greeks <b>would</b> <b>describe</b> {{water as}} robust, heavy or light, dry, acidic, pungent, wine-like, etc. One {{of the comic}} poet Antiphanes's {{characters}} claimed that he could recognize Attic water by taste alone. Athenaeus states {{that a number of}} philosophers had a reputation for drinking nothing but water, a habit combined with a vegetarian diet (cf.below). Milk, usually goats' milk, was not widely consumed, being considered barbaric.|$|E
25|$|Portuguese {{phonology}} {{is similar}} to those of languages such as French (especially that of Quebec), the Gallo-Italic languages, Occitan, Catalan and Franco-Provençal, unlike that of Spanish, which {{is similar to}} those of Sardinian and the Southern Italian dialects. Some <b>would</b> <b>describe</b> the phonology of Portuguese as a blend of Spanish, Gallo-Romance (e.g. French) and the languages of northern Italy (especially Genoese), but with a deeper Celtic influence.|$|E

25|$|In 1948, Hitchcock {{cast him}} in Rope, a fictionalized {{account of the}} Leopold and Loeb murder case, which earned mixed reviews, but much {{critical}} praise for Granger. Hitchcock then cast him again in Strangers on a Train, as a tennis star drawn into a double murder plot by a wealthy psychopath, played by Robert Walker. Granger <b>would</b> <b>describe</b> this as his happiest film-making experience, and was deeply saddened by Walker's death shortly after shooting.|$|E
25|$|At the time, Richardson's {{research}} was {{ignored by the}} scientific community. Today, it is considered {{an element of the}} beginning of the modern study of fractals. Richardson's {{research was}} quoted by mathematician Benoît Mandelbrot in his 1967 paper How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Richardson identified a value (between 1 and 2) that <b>would</b> <b>describe</b> the changes (with increasing measurement detail) in observed complexity for a particular coastline; this value served {{as a model for the}} concept of fractal dimension.|$|E
25|$|Unlike benzene, the carbon–carbon {{bonds in}} {{naphthalene}} {{are not of}} the same length. The bonds C1−C2, C3−C4, C5−C6 and C7−C8 are about 1.37 Å (137 pm) in length, whereas the other carbon–carbon bonds are about 1.42 Å (142 pm) long. This difference, established by X-ray diffraction, {{is consistent with the}} valence bond model in naphthalene and in particular, with the theorem of cross-conjugation. This theorem <b>would</b> <b>describe</b> naphthalene as an aromatic benzene unit bonded to a diene but not extensively conjugated to it (at least in the ground state). As such, naphthalene possesses several resonance structures.|$|E
