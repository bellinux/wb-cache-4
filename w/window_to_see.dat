5|$|Back at her apartment, Scully runs a {{background}} check of Doggett on her computer, learning about his background as a former NYPD detective. She feels sick and leaves the computer, and later on calls her mom, Margaret (Sheila Larken). When she realizes her phone is tapped, she looks outside the <b>window</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if anyone is out there. She angrily calls Doggett to protest him monitoring her phone conversations, which he seems genuinely surprised about. She notices a mysterious man and runs into the hall to pursue him, but meets her landlord Mr. Coeben who tells {{her that he had}} seen Mulder.|$|E
25|$|Social {{networks}} are, in many cases, a good {{tool for}} avoiding costly market research. They are the shortest, fastest and most direct {{way to reach}} an audience through a person who, in that specific community, has more credibility than anyone. For example, an athlete ‘delivers’ to their sponsor a consumer base {{of millions of people}} who every day are interested in what they do, what they feel, what they consume. No need to go to a Nikeshop <b>window</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Cristiano Ronaldo’s latest boots. He sells them for you directly via a Tweet.|$|E
500|$|As a boy, {{inventor}} George Escol Sellers knew Eckfeldt; as Sellers's {{father was}} {{partner in a}} firm which sold machinery to the Mint Bureau, Eckfeldt often dined at his house. [...] In the final years both of the 19th century and of Sellers's life, he published his memoirs, including memories of the first Philadelphia Mint. [...] He recalled in 1812 peering through a <b>window</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> cents coined, and Eckfeldt coming into the room to stop the work {{at the end of}} the day. [...] Seeing the young Sellers, he had the boy come in, had him place a cent planchet on the press, and struck it for him. [...] Sellers nearly dropped it because it was so hot, and Eckfeldt reminded him it had been cold when placed in the press. Eckfeldt bade him keep the coin until he learned why the cent had become hot, and then he could spend it on candy.|$|E

500|$|L'Estrange's balloon descended rapidly {{over the}} rooftops of Woolloomooloo, {{slamming}} {{into a house}} near the corner of Palmer Street and Robinson Lane. L'Estrange managed to disentangle himself and fell first onto a chimney then a shed [...] below. He scrambled down from the rooftops to a waiting mob, who whisked him away to Robinson's hotel on the William Street corner and would not let him leave. At the crash site, during an attempt to free the balloon, the escaping gas was ignited when the resident of the house opened a <b>window</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what the commotion was and the gas {{came into contact with}} the open flame of the room's chandelier. The resulting fireball destroyed the balloon, burnt a number of bystanders and was bright enough to [...] "...cast a brief but vivid illumination over the entire suburb". A panicked crush developed as groups tried to both flee from and rush towards the brief, but extremely bright, conflagration while those further away at the launch site assumed L'Estrange had been killed. Several people were injured in the crush or burned by the fire with one lady reportedly being blinded.|$|E
500|$|On Wednesday, March 3, 1993, in Rancho Viejo, Texas, an {{affluent}} community {{just north of}} Brownsville, Fischer woke up early {{to get ready for}} school. Just before 7:00a.m., he went to the garage and reversed his mother's car into the circular driveway at his home at 3 Cortez Avenue. He then walked toward {{the corner of the house}} and grabbed a garden hose to spray water on the car's windows, which were covered in dust. As he sprayed the car, someone came from behind and shot him twice at point-blank range with what would later be identified as a [...]38 Super pistol. One of the shots penetrated his chest and the others his brain. Fischer's mother looked out the <b>window</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what had happened, thinking the noise came from one of the house's palm tree branches falling on the roof, or that the car had backfired. She did not see the car, and thought that perhaps her son had gone to a convenience store to pick up something, but Fischer's brother Eric told her he could see the car parked on the driveway.|$|E

2500|$|About {{a minute}} after the shooting, a woman {{seated next to}} her boyfriend in his car {{on the other side}} of the city park saw a [...] "white male [...] a light-colored, cheap nylon wig" [...] sprint from the park and enter a [...] "small, light-colored" [...] auto, which drove away quickly. [...] "He looks like he just robbed a bank", said the woman, who wrote what she could see of the car's license plate. She was unable to {{determine}} the first two characters, but was certain that the others were either 4-GUR or 4-GVR. Other witnesses included a woman who saw a light car speed away from the park about 20 seconds after the gunshots, and at least two witnesses who described a yellow Volkswagen driving quickly from the neighborhood with its headlights off. A neighborhood resident given the pseudonym Mary Lyons heard the gunshots and Violante's calls for help, and glanced from her apartment <b>window</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a man whom she later positively identified as Berkowitz, who was walking casually away from the crime scene as many others were rushing towards the scene to render aid.|$|E
2500|$|The loss of Attu placed American {{forces in}} between Paramushiro and Kiska, {{allowing}} them to blockade Kiska. United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) aircraft soon began to operate from Attu; USAAF aircraft staging through Attu even made the first airstrike against Paramushiro on 18 July 1943, causing a startled Kawase to wheel his office chair to a <b>window</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what was happening after a string of bombs detonated on a taxiway. The USAAF aircraft on Attu strengthened the blockade of Kiska and {{made it impossible for}} Kawase to send supplies or reinforcements to Kiska in surface ships; only his submarine force made resupply runs there, completing 20 such trips by 9 June 1943. Imperial General Headquarters wanted the Kiska garrison withdrawn so that its troops could be employed in the defense of the Kurile Islands, and ordered Kawase to use his submarines to evacuate them. The pace of American operations in the Aleutians suggested that the Allies would invade Kiska by late July 1943, and Kawase doubted that his submarine force [...] originally 13 submarines, but reduced to eight thanks to combat losses since the Battle of Attu began [...] could complete the 40 to 50 trips necessary to complete an evacuation by then. By 21 June, when Kawase ordered an end to the submarine evacuation operations, the 5th Fleet had lost three more submarines, and Japanese submarines had managed to evacuate only 820 troops, of whom 300 had died in the sinking of the submarines carrying them.|$|E
2500|$|Chan-wook {{stated that}} he named the main {{character}} Oh Daesu [...] "to remind the viewer of Oedipus." [...] In one of the film's iconic shots, Yoo Ji-tae, who played Woo-jin, strikes an extraordinary yoga pose. Park Chan-wook said he designed this pose to convey [...] "the image of Apollo." [...] It was Apollo's prophecy that revealed Oedipus' fate in Sophocles' Oedipus the King. The link to Oedipus Rex is only a minor element in most English-language criticism of the movie, while Koreans have made it a central theme. Sung Hee Kim wrote [...] "Family seen through Greek tragedy and Korean movie – Oedipus the King and Old Boy." [...] Kim Kyungae offers a different analysis, with Dae-su and Woo-jin both representing Oedipus. [...] Besides the theme of unknown incest revealed, Oedipus gouges his eyes out to avoid seeing a world that despises the truth, while Oh Dae-su cuts off his tongue to avoid revealing the truth to his world. More parallels with Greek tragedy include the fact that Lee Woo-jin looks relatively young as compared to Oh Dae-su when {{they are supposed to}} be contemporaries at school, which makes Lee Woo-jin look like an immortal Greek god whereas Oh Dae-su is merely an aged mortal. The incest scene between Lee Woo-jin and his sister is also very striking and beautifully shot, as Greek gods are renown for their incestuous license (e.g. Zeus and Hera, and many more), and the way Oh Dae-Su peeps through the <b>window</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> their incestuous love has an ethereal feel to it, as if he were a lowly mortal in the aether (divine realm of Greek gods) witnessing something which he should not have seen and hence trespassing the boundaries between gods and men, which is another classic act of hubris in Greek tragedy which leads to divine intervention and human punishment. Indeed, throughout the movie Lee Woo-jin is portrayed as an obscenely rich young man who lives in a lofty tower and is omnipresent due to having placed ear bugs on Oh Dae-Su and co, which again furthers the parallel between his character and the secrecy of Greek gods. One could also mention Mido, who throughout the movie comes across as a strong-willed, young and innocent girl, which is not too far from Sophocles' Antigone, Oedipus' daughter, who, though she does not commit incest with her father, remains faithful and loyal to him which reminds us of the bittersweet ending where Mido reunites with Oh Dae-Su and takes care of him in the wilderness (cf Oedipus at Colonus, the second installment of the Oedipus trilogy straightafter Oedipus Tyrannus). Another interesting character is the hypnotist, who, apart from being able to hypnotise people, also has the power to make people fall in love (e.g. Oh and Mido), which is characteristic of the power of Aphrodite, the goddess of love, whose classic act is to make Paris and Helen fall in love before and during the Trojan War.|$|E
