The women formed the Committee for Women's Suffrage (Komitée für das Frauenstimmrecht) to work towards gaining the vote. In 1971 and 1973, referenda failed with the majority blocking enfranchisement. Unable to make headway, in 1981, Marxer and other feminists formed Aktion Dornröschen, which technically means thorny rose, but was a play on words for the German name of the fairy tale [...] "Sleeping Beauty". The women brought a complaint to the Constitutional Court charging that their rights had been abridged. In 1982, the case was dismissed. The government refused to reevaluate the situation, forcing Marxer and 11 other Sleeping Beauty activists to take other action. They traveled throughout Europe speaking about their lack of rights. In 1983, they arrived in Strasbourg, France, where Marxer and the others brought their concerns before the Council of Europe. The move brought criticism at home, for putting the country in the international spotlight, but it was effective. On 2 July 1984, the male voters in Liechtenstein granted full voting rights to women.|$|R

The work aims to answer two research questions: How did Plato and Aristotle perceive the essence of goodness in human life? <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>supposed</b> {{to do in order to}} accomplish human well-being? The first chapter contains a brief summary of ethical ideas of both philosophers. In the following chapters their concepts of areté, soul and goodness are analysed and compared. The comparison supports the fact that both Plato and Aristotle basically agreed on the essence of human goodness. They consider it the sole criterion of human well-being, both of them connect it with moral values and argue that it can be only achived through life in accordance with the virtues. On the other hand, Plato and Aristotle differ from each other in the way how can be such human goodness and well-being achieved. Aristotle's views based on the ethical issues, however, can not be perceived as totally different from those of Plato, but rather as a further elaboration and supplement of his ideas and opinions...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1990 Martin Buber was {{an internationally}} known scholar, teacher, and author whose works covered education, communication, politics, theology, philosophy, counseling, and related fields. The {{purpose of this}} study was to {{discover}} the implications of Buber's philosophy of education for the student services profession. Previous attempts to relate Martin Buber's philosophy to student services were reviewed and a "Buber Primer" of useful terms for the student services professional was presented. The implications of education of character, dialogue, and educator-student relationship for four central questions for the student services profession were addressed: (1) Who are we as professionals?; (2) <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>supposed</b> to do; (3) How?; and (4) Why? Buber proposes that education is essentially the education of character. Student services professionals should define themselves as educators; persons concerned with the development of the whole student. Buber defines dialogue as a seven step process: a turning of the being, confirmation, a sense of empathy, authenticity, common fruitfulness, silence, and commitment. Professional educators are encouraged to engage students in dialogue. Dialogue is defined as the delivery mechanism for developmentally based student services and for the education of character. Buber's concepts were related to the various activities of student services. Martin Buber's philosophy of dialogue and his 'education of character' should enhance the ability of professionals in student services to serve all students more intelligently and effectively. This study concluded that Martin Buber's philosophy belongs both in the vocabulary and the practice of student services...|$|E

40|$|When the Oregon Higher Education Coordinating Commission (HECC) {{was first}} convened {{in the summer}} of 2012 its first topic of {{conversation}} among its members was, “why we here, and <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>supposed</b> to be doing?” The Commission was a body created by legislation but convened with no formal authority, no clearly defined role, no staff, and no budget. The state education agencies such as the Oregon University System (OUS) and the Department of Community Colleges and Workforce Development (CCWD) were barely paying attention. The Commission members were all distinguished education professionals and student activists with a range of experience and expertise, but not household names. No longer does the HECC question its role. Only one original member of the Commission is still serving (Vice Chair Betty Duvall), and the HECC is now acknowledged as the sole state level authority governing (or “coordinating”) all of state higher education, meaning all seven state universities and all seventeen community colleges. Many of the governance functions of the OUS chancellor’s office have been distributed to independent boards (chosen and ratified by the Governor and legislature), and the CCWD has been subsumed within the HECC, no longer an independent state agency with its own policy authority. In the intervening two years, a series of bills passed by the Oregon legislature had conferred nearly all the policy-making authority for state funded higher education on this formerly toothless Commission. HECC now has a staff of over 20 (more than forty if the staff from the other agencies that have been absorbed by HECC are counted) and an annual budget of $ 3. 8 million. HECC’s chair, Tim Nesbitt, and executive director, Ben Cannon, are two of Governor John Kitzhaber’s closest advisors on education, which as much as anything signals this Commission’s importance. In 2012 almost no one expected the HECC to last, much less become the state’s hub for higher education policy.

40|$|Paper-ballot {{elections}} {{may be a}} bit cumbersome {{yet many}} people will agree that the procedures to be followed are sufficiently transparent to all parties involved. The principles for fair elections are clear, and common sense tells people what to look for to detect potential fraud. The process is trans-parent. For computerized elections the principles for fair elections are not all that obvious anymore. In particular, the internet {{turns out to be a}} highway fraught with accidents, where breaches of security and privacy have become all too common. News items reporting on such incidents get to the general public on an almost daily basis. For elections to be considered fair in such hostile environments, new rules and standards need to be set in order to compensate for the lack of transparency. It is helpful to start looking at one of the problems to be solved by any voting system. Namely, the fundamental problem of achieving accuracy and ballot secrecy at the same time-assuming it is agreed that ballot secrecy is an essential ingredient for achieving democracy. Accuracy of the final tally means that it corresponds exactly to the ballots cast by legitimate voters. For instance, when voting by hand-raising it is easy to convince everybody of the correctness of the tally, but then there is no privacy. A common way for internet-based elections these days is to put up a secure web server (plus database) for collecting the votes. Assuming the web server somehow ascertains the identity of voters and allows only one vote per voter, the idea is that the web server will honestly process each ballot by keeping a running total and forgetting who exactly voted what. At the end of the day, a final tally may then be produced. Now suppose someone is not happy with the result, or rather, suppose not everybody believes it is the correct result, and a re-count is demanded. <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>supposed</b> to do? We could show them the records representing the ballots again, and have them check the total. But these records need not have to do anything with the ballots cast by the legitimate voters: to protect the voters ’ privacy all identifying information has been removed. In fact, any audit trail for this type of system would violate ballot secrecy...|$|E
