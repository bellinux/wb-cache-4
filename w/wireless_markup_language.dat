2500|$|Chromium 13.0 was {{released}} on 26 April 2011, with 13.0.748.0 as the initial version. Early versions of Chromium 13 included a menu button to enable users to switch between multiple Google profiles, multi-selection of tabs and an improved omnibox engine. This version also included several minor GUI changes, including a slightly lightened menu bar. By early May 2011 the results of Google's attempts to reduce the file size of Chromium were already being noted. Much of the early {{work in this area}} concentrated on shrinking the size of WebKit, by removing <b>Wireless</b> <b>Markup</b> <b>Language</b> (WML), the Image Resizer, datagrids and the Android build system. The largest Chromium nightly build was 35.3 MB on 15 April 2011, but this was reduced to 29.9 MB by 20 April 2011. Later builds of Chromium and Chrome in mid-May 2011 introduced the optional [...] "compact navigation view", aimed at mobile device users. This view combined the tab and URL/menu bars into one bar, by making the URL bar hide when not in use, thus saving 30 pixels of vertical space.|$|E

50|$|A {{general-purpose}} <b>markup</b> <b>language</b> is a <b>markup</b> <b>language</b> that is {{used for}} more than one purpose or situation. Other, more specialized domain-specific <b>markup</b> <b>languages</b> are often based upon these languages. For example, HTML 4.1 and earlier are domain-specific <b>markup</b> <b>languages</b> (for webpages), and are based on the syntax of SGML, which is a general-purpose <b>markup</b> <b>language.</b>|$|R

Hence the Nokia Services (WAP) browser was the default browser on initial device shipments of this platform.|$|E

50|$|The mobile Web {{primarily}} utilises lightweight pages {{like this}} one written in Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML) or <b>Wireless</b> <b>Markup</b> <b>Language</b> (WML) to deliver content to mobile devices.

50|$|The Extensible User Interface Protocol, or XUP, is a {{proposed}} web standard. XUP is a SOAP-based protocol for communicating {{events in a}} user interface, where the user interface is described by an XML document.

Examples given in the specification for possible user interface languages include XHTML, <b>Wireless</b> <b>Markup</b> <b>Language,</b> and XUL.|$|E

It is argued that a general music <b>markup</b> <b>language</b> should consider more than just CWN. A framework for such a comprehensive general music <b>markup</b> <b>language</b> is proposed.

50|$|<b>Wireless</b> <b>Markup</b> <b>Language</b> (WML), {{based on}} XML, is a markup {{language}} intended for devices that implement the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) specification, such as mobile phones. It provides navigational support, data input, hyperlinks, text and image presentation, and forms, much like HTML (HyperText Markup Language). It preceded {{the use of}} other markup languages now used with WAP, such as HTML itself, and XHTML (which are gaining in popularity as processing power in mobile devices increases).|$|E
5000|$|A WAP gateway sits between mobile devices {{using the}} WAP {{protocol}} and the World Wide Web, passing pages {{from one to}} the other much like a proxy. This translates pages into a form suitable for the mobiles, for instance using the <b>Wireless</b> <b>Markup</b> <b>Language</b> (WML). This process is hidden from the phone, so it may access the page in the same way as a browser accesses HTML, using a URL (for example, [...] ), provided the mobile phone operator has not specifically prevented this.|$|E
50|$|Although conceptually simple, this {{architecture}} is {{not conducive to}} large-scale application development because, inevitably, {{a great deal of}} functionality is duplicated in each JSP. Also, the Model 1 architecture unnecessarily ties together the business logic and presentation logic of the application. Combining business logic with presentation logic makes it hard to introduce a new 'view' or access point in an application. For example, in addition to an HTML interface, you might want to include a <b>Wireless</b> <b>Markup</b> <b>Language</b> (WML) interface for wireless access. In this case, using Model 1 will unnecessarily require the duplication of the business logic with each instance of the presentation code.|$|E
