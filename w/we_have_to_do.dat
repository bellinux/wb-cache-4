25|$|When {{our father}} Adam {{came into the}} garden of Eden, he came into it with a {{celestial}} body, and brought Eve, one of his wives, with him. He helped to make and organize this world. He is MICHAEL, the Archangel, the ANCIENT OF DAYS! about whom holy men have written and spokenHe is our FATHER and our GOD, and the only God with whom <b>WE</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Every man upon the earth, professing Christians or non-professing, must hear it, and will know it sooner or later.|$|E
25|$|The United States {{needed to}} find a vehicle to {{continue}} to contain Saddam because the CIA said all <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is wait six months and Saddam is going to collapse on his own volition. That vehicle is sanctions. They needed a justification; the justification was disarmament. They drafted a Chapter 7 resolution of the United Nations Security Council calling for the disarmament of Iraq and saying in Paragraph 14 that if Iraq complies, sanctions will be lifted. Within months of this resolution being passed—and the United States drafted and {{voted in favor of}} this resolution—within months, the President, George Herbert Walker Bush, and his Secretary of State, James Baker, are saying publicly, not privately, publicly that even if Iraq complies with its obligation to disarm, economic sanctions will be maintained until which time Saddam Hussein is removed from power.|$|E

500|$|The group drew {{inspiration}} from short-lived punk bands like the Fat Sluts, The Lone Reagans and Forbidden Mule, whom Ferguson describes as [...] "like all punk bands... very fast and furious." [...] Much of the band's provocative style emerged from their origins as street performers, where to get people's attention they resorted to outrageous or theatrical tactics—the group would sometimes walk {{into the street and}} stop traffic to get noticed. [...] "Sometimes <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> really ugly or horrendous things to get people's attention, and we're not afraid to do that. We'll hit someone if it gets a bit of discourse going," [...] said McDermott.|$|E
500|$|During the sixties, Kraft was a {{household}} name in America. He appeared {{on the cover of}} the August 27, 1965 issue of Time Magazine, in which he was profiled as the [...] "Conductor in a Command Post". In his interview with Time, Kraft compared himself with namesake Christopher Columbus, displaying what the magazine described as [...] "an almost angry pride" [...] in his work. [...] "We know a lot more about what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> than he did," [...] Kraft said. [...] "And we know where we're going." [...] The article described Kraft's role in the Gemini 5 mission, and drew on Kraft's frequent comparisons of his position as flight director with that of an orchestra conductor.|$|E
500|$|Kennedy {{stepped outside}} and quietly remarked, [...] "We spend $75 {{billion a year}} on armaments and $3 {{billion a year on}} dogs. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> more for these {{children}} that didn't ask to be born into this." [...] Local newspaper editor Cliff Langford, who strongly disliked Kennedy, shouted back that the two senators were being brainwashed. Clark retorted, [...] "Don't worry. We've been brainwashed from the other side." [...] Langford added, [...] "I don't know of anybody starving down here." [...] Kennedy responded, [...] "Step over here and I'll introduce you to some." [...] Clark reassured the reporters that he and Kennedy were not observing conditions in the Delta to [...] "find fault," [...] but rather [...] "just {{to see if we can}} do anything about it." ...|$|E

500|$|Pascu parted with Divertis in 2007. At the time, he {{indicated}} that {{he could no longer}} handle their tight schedule. The break was not total, though, since Pascu continued to appear on Animat Planet. In a 2007 interview, reflecting on that show's impact, he stated, [...] "I'm not much of a fan of political humor. I simply like the impromptu kind of humor [...] If [...] happens to be political, it is because that is what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in this series." [...] In 2012, he asserted that his break with political humor was definitive, and against the consensus in Divertis—in 2007, Pascu noted there was already a disagreement between him and Toni Grecu. Shortly after his departure, a conflict between Grecu and the other Divertis actors broke Divertis into competing halves.|$|E
500|$|In February 2011, McGuinness {{said that}} the album was almost {{complete}} and had a tentative release date of May 2011, although he noted that Songs of Ascent {{was no longer the}} likely title. The Songs of Ascent project ultimately did not come to fruition and has not been released; its evolution and apparent abandonment are examined in the book The Greatest Albums You'll Never Hear. Bassist Adam Clayton said, [...] "We thought there was more material left over from No Line... we now feel a long way from that material." [...] The dance-centric album was ultimately aborted as well; Clayton said, [...] "The work we did with RedOne was very, very exciting. But again, I'm not sure it was the essence of what U2 is good at... <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what we do best and we have to focus on that, and the work we did with Danger Mouse came closest to that." [...] Guetta clarified that he was not involved in the dance project and had only discussed a possible collaboration with Bono.|$|E
500|$|Marburger {{responded to}} {{criticism}} of his support for Bush administration policies in 2004, stating [...] "No one will know my personal positions on issues as long as I am in this job. I am here {{to make sure that}} the science input to policy making is sound and that the executive branch functions properly with respect to its science and technology missions." [...] On the topic of stem cell research, he in 2004 said that stem cells [...] "offer great promise for addressing incurable diseases and afflictions. But I can’t tell you when a fertilized egg becomes sacred. That’s not my job. That’s not a science issue. And so whatever I think about reproductive technology or choice, or whatever, is irrelevant to my job as a science adviser." [...] However, in February 2005, in a speech at the annual conference of the National Association of Science Writers, he stated, [...] "Intelligent design is not a scientific theory.... I don't regard intelligent design as a scientific topic". Also In 2005, he told The New York Times that [...] "global warming exists, and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something about it." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Lewis, {{the song}} was conceptualised when the singer was {{experiencing}} a stressful time in her personal life when she visited her friend and co-writer of the song, Ryan Tedder in Denver, Colorado. The aim of the trip was to visit Tedder and his family, as well as conceive ideas and themes for material to be included on Glassheart. Lewis stated {{that she did not}} want to sing a ballad which would make her [...] "more sad", therefore they decided to work on an upbeat dance song instead. She asked Tedder: [...] "Can you give me a song where I can just dance and jump around?", to which he replied [...] "What about this?" [...] as he played a beat which Lewis found [...] "hypnotic". Despite being in a raw form, Lewis was impressed with the song's beat, and said [...] "Yes! <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this." [...] The collaboration with Tedder marks the third album of Lewis' on which the pair have worked together. They first collaborated on Lewis' debut studio album, Spirit (2007), on the songs [...] "Bleeding Love" [...] and [...] "Take a Bow". Tedder also co-wrote songs on Lewis' second studio album, Echo (2009), [...] "Happy", [...] "You Don't Care" [...] and [...] "Lost then Found", a collaboration with the group Tedder is a member of, OneRepublic. In addition to the title track on Glassheart, Lewis and Tedder collaborated on the song [...] "Favourite Scar".|$|E
500|$|Perot {{participated in}} the first of three presidential debates for the 1992 election, on October 11 in Clayton, Missouri, along with George Bush and Bill Clinton. It {{was the first time that}} a third party {{candidate}} was involved in a national televised debate since John B. Anderson in 1980, and was the first presidential debate to ever feature three candidates. During the event, Perot discussed a wide range of issues including the budget deficit, education and drug use, and proclaimed that as president, he would eliminate the influence of lobbyists. He also had a few memorable quips. When asked to address detractors' criticism of his lack of government experience, he remarked: [...] "Well, they've got a point. I don't have any experience running up a $4 trillion debt." [...] When discussing what would happen if one of his opponents won, he commented: [...] "then they will have heard the harsh reality of what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> I'm not playing Lawrence Welk music here tonight." [...] After the debate, three out of four polls declared Perot as the winner. The average of all four showed Perot at 37% followed by Clinton with 30% and Bush with 18%, but election polls still showed Perot in third with 14%, far behind both Bush and Clinton. His running mate, James Stockdale, participated in a Vice Presidential debate in Atlanta, with fellow Vice Presidential nominee Al Gore and Vice President Dan Quayle. Largely unknown to the general public, Stockdale memorably opened the debate by unexpectedly asking the philosophical question, [...] "Who am I? Why am I here?" [...] He was unprepared to deal with some of the substantive issues raised, and his struggling performance may have damaged the Perot campaign.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2008, Kiribati {{officials}} asked Australia and New Zealand {{to accept}} Kiribati citizens as permanent refugees. Kiribati {{is expected to}} be the first country to lose all its land territory to global warming. In June 2008, the Kiribati President Anote Tong said that the country has reached [...] "the point of no return." [...] He added, [...] "To plan for the day when you no longer have a country is indeed painful but I think <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that." ...|$|E

5000|$|A week later, Yahoo! {{agreed to}} settle with {{affected}} Chinese dissidents, paying them undisclosed compensation. Yang stated, [...] "After {{meeting with the}} families, it was clear <b>to</b> me what <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> make this right for them, for Yahoo, and for the future." [...] That week, Yang established the Yahoo! Human Rights Fund, a fund to provide [...] "humanitarian and legal support" [...] to online dissidents.|$|R
2500|$|Nothing threatens America, it's far away. But Eastern Europe {{countries}} will place themselves under {{the threat of}} total annihilation. Only they themselves will be to blame. Because we cannot allow missiles and planes to be aimed at Russia from their territories. We have to destroy them {{half an hour before}} they launch. And then <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> carpet bombing so that not a single launch pad remains or even one plane. So -- no Baltics, no Poland. Let NATO immediately ask for negotiations with our Foreign Ministry. Then we'll stop. Otherwise well have to teach them the lessons of May 1945." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a ComputerWorld {{interview}} Espuelas said, [...] "What <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is remain absolutely {{focused on}} giving our users {{the best possible}} experience, and giving our partners and advertisers a mutually profitable relationship. We're really looking forward, not backwards. All of this competition has stimulated the market in a very dramatic fashion, in terms of marketing, in terms of growing the market, {{in terms of the}} attention of advertisers, partners and Wall Street. So we see it very positively. We just need to make sure we're never satisfied with ourselves, and we're not. We can always be better and faster and more efficient." ...|$|E
2500|$|In all {{the above}} {{examples}} {{the case of}} the subject of the infinitive is governed by the case requirements of the main verb and [...] "the infinitive is appended as a third argument" [...] (Concerning the second and third examples, in modern linguistic terms <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with an object control construction). As fas as the two first are concerned, traditionally this construction is sometimes called (in Latin terminology) dativus cum infinitivo or genitivus cum infinitivo (dative with the infinitive or genitive with the infinitive respectively) and {{is considered to be a}} case attraction, the dative or genitive being used instead of a predicate in the accusative: see also below.|$|E

5000|$|DeBartolo affirms this, saying: [...] "I {{tried to}} run the 49ers like a family rather than a business. I viewed the players and myself really, basically, as a partnership. Our goal was to win the Super Bowl every year, and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that together." ...|$|R
5000|$|In a 1990 interview, Flora said, [...] "Burl Ives was a troublemaker. His wife handled his {{affairs and}} if you forgot some da-da-da, {{she was on the}} phone to the {{president}} of Columbia. I don’t know whether <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this over again or what." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "We're on {{a mission}} to kind of make a name for ourselves", Dallas nose tackle Russell Maryland said. [...] "People said {{a couple of years ago}} that our defense was like a three-ring circus out there. Now we're out to prove that we're the {{greatest}} show on earth." [...] "We just don't get any credit", added safety Ray Horton, describing a defense that did not have any Pro Bowl selections. [...] "We come up and do what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Hey, we've won 12 games! Other higher-ranked defenses are at home right now. So it's not like we're riding the coattails of our offense." ...|$|E
2500|$|We are {{describing}} {{the area of}} a rectangle, with the width times the height, and we are adding the areas together. [...] Each rectangle, {{by virtue of the}} mean value theorem, describes an approximation of the curve section it is drawn over. Also [...] need not be the same for all values of i, or in other words that the width of the rectangles can differ. [...] What <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is approximate the curve with n rectangles. [...] Now, as the size of the partitions get smaller and n increases, resulting in more partitions to cover the space, we get {{closer and closer to the}} actual area of the curve.|$|E
2500|$|... "Friendship with Jesus Christ" [...] is a {{frequent}} theme of his preaching. He stressed that on this intimate friendship, [...] "everything depends." [...] He also said: [...] "We are all called to open ourselves to this friendship with God... speaking to him as to a friend, the only One who can make the world both good and happy... That is all <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is put ourselves at his disposal...is an extremely important message. It is a message that helps to overcome what can be considered the great temptation of our time: the claim, that after the Big Bang, God withdrew from history." [...] Thus, in his book Jesus of Nazareth, his main purpose was [...] "to help foster [...] {{the growth of a}} living relationship" [...] with Jesus Christ.|$|E
60|$|Of course all {{danger was}} now past.
