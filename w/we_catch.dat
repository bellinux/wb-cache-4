25|$|Sampling schemes may {{be without}} {{replacement}} ('WOR'—no element can be selected {{more than once}} in the same sample) or with replacement ('WR'—an element may appear multiple times in the one sample). For example, if <b>we</b> <b>catch</b> fish, measure them, and immediately return them to the water before continuing with the sample, this is a WR design, because we might end up catching and measuring the same fish more than once. However, if we do not return the fish to the water (e.g., if we eat the fish), this becomes a WOR design.|$|E
25|$|Habitus is {{somewhat}} reminiscent of preexisting sociological {{concepts such as}} socialization, but habitus also differs from the more classic concepts in several important ways. Firstly, a central aspect of the habitus is its embodiment: Habitus does not only, or even primarily, function {{at the level of}} explicit, discursive consciousness. The internal structures become embodied and work in a deeper, practical and often pre-reflexive way. An illustrative example might be the 'muscle memory' cultivated in many areas of physical education. Consider the way <b>we</b> <b>catch</b> a ball - the complex geometric trajectories are not calculated; it is not an intellectual process. Although it is a skill that requires learning, it is more a physical than a mental process and has to be performed physically to be learned. In this sense, the concept has something in common with Anthony Giddens' concept of practical consciousness.|$|E
500|$|Reviews for season 3 of House of Cards {{were mostly}} positive. However, a few critics found the Underwood {{character}} was becoming repetitive: the critical {{consensus on the}} review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes held that, [...] "Season three introduces intriguing new political and personal elements to Frank Underwood's character, even if it feels like {{more of the same}} for some." [...] Ed Power of The Daily Telegraph wrote, [...] "Everyone in House of Cards has an agenda - a secret twitching in the attic. The thrill, and the horror, may lie in the degree to which <b>we</b> <b>catch</b> reflections of real life in its dark, cool contours." ...|$|E

60|$|One night <b>we</b> <b>catched</b> {{a little}} {{section of a}} lumber raft--nice pine planks. It was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long, and the top stood above water six or seven inches--a solid, level floor. We could see saw-logs go by in the {{daylight}} sometimes, but we let them go; we didn't show ourselves in daylight.|$|R

500|$|Before {{leaving town}} after Congress adjourned in March 1865, Stevens privately urged Lincoln {{to press the}} South hard militarily, though the war was ending. [...] Lincoln replied, [...] "Stevens, {{this is a pretty}} big hog we are trying to catch and to hold when <b>we</b> <b>catch</b> him. [...] We must take care that he does not slip away from us." [...] Never to see Lincoln again, Stevens left with [...] "a homely metaphor but no real {{certainty}} of having left as much as a thumbprint on Lincoln's policy.” On the evening of April 14, 1865, Lincoln was assassinated by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth. [...] Stevens did not attend the ceremonies when Lincoln's funeral train stopped in Lancaster; he was said to be ill. Trefousse speculated he may avoided the rites for other reasons. [...] According to Lincoln biographer Carl Sandburg, Stevens stood at a railroad bridge and lifted his hat.|$|E
2500|$|Voice {{production}} started {{six months}} before the game's beta release. The voice production team were given the script 90% complete to work with. [...] "There were a few changes made during recording, but most of the remaining 10 percent will be dealt with in our pickup session," [...] O'Farrell said, [...] "The pickup session is right {{at the end of the}} project, where <b>we</b> <b>catch</b> performance issues, tutorial lines, verbal hints, and anything else that we might have overlooked." [...] A game the size of Knights of the Old Republic would typically take seven weeks to record; two weeks of recording all-day and all-night meant LucasArts were able to record all voices in five weeks. Actors were recorded one at a time, as the non-linear nature of the game meant it was too complicated and expensive to record more than one actor at a time.|$|E
2500|$|Lü Meng {{was from}} Fupo County (富陂縣), Runan Commandery (汝南郡), {{which is located}} {{southeast}} of present-day Funan County, Anhui. His family migrated {{to the south of}} the Yangtze River when Lü Meng was young. Lü Meng lived with his brother-in-law, Deng Dang (鄧當), who served as a military officer under Sun Ce. When he was 14 or 15, he secretly followed Deng Dang to the battles against the Shanyue tribes. Deng Dang was shocked to see his teenage brother-in-law in battle, so he scolded Lü Meng and warned him to stop. Lü Meng refused to listen so Deng Dang told Lü Meng's mother about this. When she wanted to punish him, Lü Meng said, [...] "It is difficult to survive in poverty. If we can prove ourselves through hard work, then wealth will come eventually. How can <b>we</b> <b>catch</b> the tiger cub if we don't enter the tiger's den?" [...] Lü Meng's mother sighed and let him have his way.|$|E

An' we saw fish in the lakes among the mountains. There are lots o' them lakes--small things some o' them--in all the gullies, and fish in most o' them; but we had neither lines nor hooks, so <b>we</b> <b>catched</b> none." ...|$|R

2500|$|Organized {{crime was}} just one of many subversive {{elements}} impacting unions. Communism and unethical employee behavior also played significant roles. When a pro-Soviet United Electrical Workers group, led by Jim Lustig, attempted to gain access to secret intelligence and suppress production on a missile being produced by an S.W. Farber plant set for Korea (to match the Soviet Chinese rocket [...] "mangling" [...] U.S. troops), Barasch worked with the employees to eliminate this communist element from the union. Pro-soviet union leaders, clearly threatened, were reported as telling workers at the plant [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>catch</b> any of you sons of bitches playing around with that AFL union, you'll be sorry for it." [...] Barasch also helped organize and participated in the Crusade for Freedom as one of a few select individuals who released 17 balloons at a 1951 ceremony on Bedloes Island to win trade union support for the freedom project in Europe, promoting freedom for countries under Communist power. The following evening, Brigadier General David Sarnoff, chairman of the Greater New York Crusade for Freedom, spoke at a convention of the Allied Trades Council and encouraged New York unions to make the Crusade for Freedom [...] "the greatest labor movement our nation has ever known." [...] Barasch responded in kind, noting [...] "the decision to place the Crusade on the convention's agenda {{is a reflection of the}} deep-felt concern of our membership over the current global struggle for men's minds." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Gambia, President Yahya Jammeh has led {{the call}} for {{legislation}} that would set laws against homosexuals that would be [...] "stricter than those in Iran", {{and that he would}} [...] "cut off the head" [...] of any gay or lesbian person discovered in the country. News reports indicated his government intended to execute all homosexuals in the country. In the speech given in Tallinding, Jammeh gave a [...] "final ultimatum" [...] to any gays or lesbians in the Gambia to leave the country. In a speech to the United Nations on 27 September 2013, Jammeh said that [...] "omosexuality in all its forms and manifestations which, though very evil, antihuman as well as anti-Allah, is being promoted as a human right by some powers", and that those who do so [...] "want {{to put an end to}} human existence". In 2014, Jammeh called homosexuals [...] "vermins" [...] by saying that [...] "We will fight these vermins called homosexuals or gays the same way we are fighting malaria-causing mosquitoes, if not more aggressively". He also went on to disparage the LGBT by saying that [...] "As far as I am concerned, LGBT can only stand for Leprosy, Gonorrhoea, Bacteria and Tuberculosis; all of which are detrimental to human existence". In 2015, in defiance of western criticism Jammeh intensified his anti-gay rhetoric, telling a crowd during an agricultural tour: [...] "If you do it [...] I will slit your throat—if you are a man and want to marry another man in this country and <b>we</b> <b>catch</b> you, no one will ever set eyes on you again, and no white person can do anything about it." ...|$|E
