25|$|Phenolics or phenol {{formaldehyde}} (PF) – high modulus, relatively heat resistant, and excellent fire resistant polymer. Used for insulating parts in electrical fixtures, paper laminated products (e.g. Formica), thermally insulation foams. It is a thermosetting plastic, with the familiar trade name Bakelite, {{that can be}} molded by heat and pressure when mixed with a filler-like <b>wood</b> <b>flour</b> or can be cast in its unfilled liquid form or cast as foam (e.g. Oasis). Problems include the probability of moldings naturally being dark colors (red, green, brown), and as thermoset {{it is difficult to}} recycle.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{processability}} of the composites {{made up of}} {{wood and}} a matrix of thermoplastic materials was experimentally and numerically investigated for six different proportions of <b>wood</b> <b>flours.</b> To {{take account of the}} enclosed gas volume responsible for inflation of the thermoplastic composite membrane, which contributes significantly to the strength and stiffness of a thermoplastic composite structure, we considered a thermodynamical approach to express external work in terms of a closed volume. The pressure load is thus deduced from the thermodynamic law of the Redlich-Kwong real gas. The viscoelastic behavior of the Lodge model is considered. The Lagrangian formulation together with the assumption of the membrane theory is used in the finite element implementation. Moreover, the air flow influence on the inflation of bubble is analyzed for six different proportions of <b>wood</b> <b>flours</b> in the HDPE material.

2500|$|Henry Ford {{promoted}} the soybean, helping to develop uses for it both {{in food and}} in industrial products, even demonstrating auto body panels made of soy-based plastics. Ford's interest led to two bushels (120 pounds) of soybeans being used in each Ford car, as well as products like the first commercial soy milk, ice cream and all-vegetable nondairy whipped topping. The Ford development of so-called soy-based plastics {{was based on the}} addition of soybean flour and <b>wood</b> <b>flour</b> to phenol formaldehyde plastics. A prototype vehicle, colloquially titled the [...] "Soybean Car", was built in 1941 out of such plastics.|$|E
2500|$|The first plastic {{based on}} a {{synthetic}} polymer was made from phenol and formaldehyde, with the first viable and cheap synthesis methods invented in 1907, by Leo Hendrik Baekeland, a Belgian-born American living in New York state. Baekeland was looking for an insulating shellac to coat wires in electric motors and generators. He found that combining phenol (C6H5OH) and formaldehyde (HCOH) formed a sticky mass and later found that the material could be mixed with <b>wood</b> <b>flour,</b> asbestos, or slate dust to create strong and fire resistant [...] "composite" [...] materials. The new material tended to foam during synthesis, requiring that Baekeland build pressure vessels to force out the bubbles and provide a smooth, uniform product, as he announced in 1909, in {{a meeting of the}} American Chemical Society. Bakelite was originally used for electrical and mechanical parts, coming into widespread use in consumer goods and jewelry in the 1920s. [...] Bakelite was a purely synthetic material, not derived from living matter. It was also an early thermosetting plastic.|$|E
2500|$|Kirkcaldy {{became a}} centre for iron {{founding}} and linen manufacturing—specialising in coarser material (i.e. sailcloth). Although {{when the market}} for sail cloth started to dip, Michael Nairn for instance began to focus more towards floorcloth, which he started to produce in his new purpose built Scottish floorboard factory at Pathhead Sands, famously nicknamed [...] "Nairn’s folly" [...] for what would become universally known as linoleum. Linoleum was first introduced by the Scottish Linoleum Company (later Barry, Ostlere and Shepherd), due to the expired patent of Frederick Walton in 1877. Although the Michael Nairn & Co Ltd have since become famous, for their Trade Mark and being the world producers of the cloth. The cloth made from cork, <b>wood</b> <b>flour</b> and linseed oil, saw production conicide with the jute mills of Dundee - with some already present in the town, particularly the West Bridges Mill in Linktown. This made Kirkcaldy easily recognisable from the queer-like smell of the odour {{of one of the}} principal ingredients, linseed oil. The Nairns, as a family, became philanthropists bequeathing land for public and commercial use, {{over the course of several}} decades, as [...] "good deeds" [...] to the citizens of Kirkcaldy, with examples such as two public parks (Beveridge and Ravenscraig) and a museum, art gallery and library complex. Other industries such as coal, pottery, flour, malt, printing, light electrical engineering and furniture manufacturing flourished. Carpets, whose production coincided with linoleum, were also made in the town for a brief time by the firm Victoria Carpets until they moved their production to Kidderminster in 1901. The burghs of Pathhead, Linktown, Gallatown and Sinclairtown were also officially merged into the royal burgh of Kirkcaldy in 1876.|$|E

30|$|The raw {{materials}} of the WPCs {{used in this}} research were building wood waste and recycled plastic (polyolefin). The ratio of <b>wood</b> <b>flours</b> to polyolefin [polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP)] was about 55 : 45 (w/w). About 5  % of compatibilizers and pigments were added. But any photo stabilizers such as UV absorbers (UVA) or hindered amine light stabilizers (HALS) were not added because of easy generation of chalking. Test specimens {{used in this study}} were made by the extrusion method. Sanding was then carried out {{on the surface of the}} WPCs to give the appearance of wood. The specimens with a size of 145 – 174 (longitudinal) ×  70 (width) ×  7  mm (thickness) were prepared from the 30  mm thick commercial hollow decks. Polyethylene reference samples, PE-RS (Japan weathering test center [17, 18]), were prepared to evaluate the oxidation–degradation of polyolefin in WPCs. The PE-RS were exposed outdoors at the same sites that were used for the WPCs outdoor exposure tests.|$|R
