5|$|Double Dash {{was first}} shown at E3 2001 as a seven-second video clip. The clip {{featured}} Mario and Luigi driving their karts on a bump mapped 3D surface with no background. At the time, it <b>was</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> development, {{and the working}} title of the game was simply Mario Kart. In April 2003, Nintendo released the first pictures and details of the game, as well as revealing the title to be Mario Kart: Double Dash!!. At E3 2003, a playable demo of the game was available. New features, such as having two characters drive one kart, had been implemented. An updated demo with some new additions was shown at the Games Convention in August 2003. In September, Nintendo held a Gamers' Summit for the press, in which a nearly complete and more sped up version of Double Dash was displayed. The Gamers' Summit also announced the North American release date to be November 17, 2003.|$|E
5|$|The Flames {{entered the}} 2010 NHL Entry Draft without a {{selection}} {{in the first}} two rounds. They would have picked 13th overall, however that pick was traded to the Phoenix Coyotes as part of a 2009 trade for Olli Jokinen. Their second round pick went to the Chicago Blackhawks as part of a 2008 deal in which Calgary acquired Rene Bourque. The Flames' first selection <b>was</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> the third round, a pick acquired from the Columbus Blue Jackets in exchange for Anton Stralman. They selected Max Reinhart with that pick. His father Paul was also a former Flames draft pick. Calgary made one trade at the draft, sending their sixth round pick (163rd overall) to the Sharks in exchange for goaltender Henrik Karlsson.|$|E

25|$|A {{constant}} {{increase in}} traffic {{and the beginning}} of the passenger jet era called for a significant expansion of the airport. In the meantime, a plan to build a residential and business district called Novi Beograd on the location of the airport was introduced. The officials decided therefore that a new international airport should be built near the village of Surƒçin to the west. The last flight to depart from the old airport <b>was</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> 1964.|$|E
25|$|Van Beers started life as {{a teacher}} of Dutch {{language}} and literature, first at Mechelen, then at Lier, and in 1860 was appointed a professor of both at the Athenaeum (high school) in Antwerp, where he had also been a sub-librarian in the communal library. Van Beers as a teacher <b>was</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> the field, with Hendrik Conscience, Willems and others, when the Flemish movement began. He composed a Dutch grammar (1852), which, in enlarged editions, still holds the field, and a volume of selections from Dutch authors, both books being so much appreciated that the Belgian government made them text-books in the public schools.|$|E

25|$|Jensen had {{a lifelong}} {{interest}} in classical music and <b>was,</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> his life, {{attracted by the}} idea of becoming a conductor himself. At 14, he conducted a band that won a nationwide contest held in San Francisco. Later, he conducted orchestras and attended a seminar given by Nikolai Sokoloff. Soon after graduating from Berkeley, he moved to New York, mainly to be near the conductor Arturo Toscanini. He was also deeply interested in the life and example of Gandhi, producing an unpublished book-length manuscript on his life. During Jensen's period in San Diego he spent time working as a social worker with the San Diego Department of Public Welfare.|$|E
25|$|Bach {{held the}} {{position}} of Thomaskantor (director of church music) in Leipzig from 1723. During his first year, beginning with the first Sunday after Trinity, he had written a first cycle of cantatas for the occasions of the liturgical year. In his second year he composed a second annual cycle of cantatas, which was planned to consist exclusively of chorale cantatas, each based on one Lutheran chorale. As Easter <b>was</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> 1725, there was no fourth Sunday after Epiphany that year. In 1735, shortly after the first performance of his Christmas Oratorio, Bach seems to have desired to fill this void and complete his cycle of chorale cantatas. For the Bach scholar Christoph Wolff {{it is evident that}} Bach reprised the second cycle in 1735, performing the new cantata between , for the third Sunday after Epiphany and , for Septuagesima.|$|E
25|$|At Kansas, Johnson gambled {{by staying}} {{out on the}} last round of pit stops, and held off Harvick and Earnhardt again to win his third race at Kansas and of the season. In winning, he {{established}} a Cup record of 23 wins on 1.5-mile tracks, taking what was both his 200th top five and his 300th top ten finish. At Charlotte, he spun out on two occasions. The first time <b>was</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> the race while running 16th coming out of turn 4 but he was lucky to avoid hitting anything. He wasn't so lucky on the second spin late in the race; while running fifth, he spun out again {{at exactly the same}} place, and hit the wall in pit road, causing some nose damage. Those spin-outs would leave him with a 40th-place finish. He rebounded the following week with a win at Dover, and also became one of four drivers to have won 10 or more races at one track. This gave him a total of 74 career wins, two fewer than Dale Earnhardt's 76.|$|E

500|$|On 26 January 1931 Nash {{was called}} for {{throwing}} in a match for Tasmania against Victoria at Launceston. He later claimed that the throw was deliberate and came out of frustration with his fielders. The call for throwing <b>was</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> the innings but Nash was able {{to recover from the}} incident to take 5/76 out of Victoria's total of 524. Earlier in the same match Nash opened the batting and made 110, his highest first-class score. It has been speculated by cricket historian Bernard Whimpress that Nash's decision to throw the ball may have been regarded by selectors as [...] "part of a parcel of anti-social behaviours which told against regular selection" [...] for either Australia or Victoria.|$|E
500|$|Already {{during the}} {{national}} convention, the Youth of the Progress Party agreed {{to form an}} informal [...] "thinking group" [...] for disenfranchised members. P√•l Atle Skjervengen <b>was</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> declaring an interest in forming a new, libertarian party. Those who resigned from the parliamentary group initially declared a lack of motivation {{to form a new}} party, and they also rejected the possibility of joining another party. They would instead vote according to the 1993 party program. Either way, in a parliamentary context they were known as independents for the remainder of their term. They did discuss the possibility of forming a [...] "support group" [...] which would help the four parliamentarians with practical issues. Odd Magnar Brub√¶k contributed advice on an informal basis from time to time. With some time passed since the Bolkesj√∏ convention, it was decided to hold a formal conference to form a support group in mid-June. Organizations in Akershus and Buskerud already existed, under the names of Fridemokratene Akershus and Buskerud Liberale Forum.|$|E
500|$|English theologian Richard Holt Hutton {{summarized}} the poem as Tennyson's [...] "friendly {{picture of the}} insatiable craving for new experience, enterprise, and adventure, when {{under the control of}} a luminous reason and a self-controlled will." [...] The contemporary poet Matthew Arnold <b>was</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> observing the narrative irony of the poem: he found Ulysses' speech [...] "the least plain, the most un-Homeric, which can possibly be conceived. Homer presents his thought to you just as it wells from the source of his mind: Mr. Tennyson carefully distils his thought before he will part with it. Hence comes ... a heightened and elaborate air." [...] A bit later, journalist and apologist Gilbert Keith Chesterton saw Ulysses as a [...] "tribute to Christianity" [...] as getting {{to the heart of the}} remarkable difference between the outlook of Antiquity and the Christian-shaped modern one, remarking: [...] "The poet reads into the story of Ulysses the conception of an incurable desire to wander. But the real Ulysses does not desire to wander at all. He desires to get home." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Monkey Gone to Heaven"'s main {{theme is}} environmentalism. The song mainly deals with man's {{destruction}} {{of the ocean and}} [...] "confusion of man's place in the universe". [...] "On one hand, it's [...] this big organic toilet. Things get flushed and repurified or decomposed and it's this big, dark, mysterious place", Black later said, [...] "It's also a very mythological place where there are octopus's gardens, the Bermuda Triangle, Atlantis, and mermaids." [...] Francis came up with the song's hook, [...] "this monkey's gone to heaven", long before the song itself was written. The line itself forms a basis for the song, which revolves around man's relationship with the divine and environmentalism. After Francis set the developing lyrics to music, he rushed to lead guitarist Joey Santiago's apartment to play it to him. Santiago later commented on the nascent performance: [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> the morning, I was still so tired. [...] 'Hey Joe, I need to come over. I need to show you something.' [...] It was awesome, really good. He had the 'If man is five' part there, and he was laughing. [...] It was hilarious".|$|E
500|$|... 343 {{started with}} a staff of roughly a dozen people, but grew to nearly 200 through {{development}}. Halo 4s development team included former employees of more than 25 triple-A studios. Prospective employees could not be told {{they were going to be}} working on Halo 4. [...] "We had people who we hired who hated Halo because of 'X,'" [...] said Frank O'Connor, 343 Industries' franchise development director. [...] "But what that really meant was, 'I feel like this game could be awesome because of 'Y input' that I'm going to bring into it. I want to prove it, and I'm passionate about proving it.' So we ended up with a bunch of people who were genuinely passionate about the product. That is a huge advantage, and that helped in hiring and forming our team." [...] This rapid hiring and growth occurred during development of the game, creating issues; because the team was committed to a delivery date, Halo 4 executive producer Kiki Wolfkill said that the team was forced to make [...] "necessary mistakes", with production difficulties and a team inexperienced with working together contributing to development difficulties. Nine months before shipping, the developers restructured the game's production pipeline and gave individual teams more control due to bottlenecks in development. [...] With so many developers from different backgrounds, forging a common goal and company culture was different. Creative director Josh Holmes recalled that an [...] "epiphany moment" [...] that proved the team was headed in the right direction <b>was</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> development, when the team completed a section of the game that was [...] "very traditional [...] ". Despite positive feedback from testers, 343 Industries discarded the prototype as too traditional, but felt that it showed the team could work together.|$|E
