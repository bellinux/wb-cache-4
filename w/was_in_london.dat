Although she began her archival research hoping to prove Edmond's assertion that the elder Martin was the Shakespeare engraver, Schlueter concludes that the newly discovered evidence actually supports the younger.|$|E

5|$|The MAUD Committee reports {{urged the}} {{co-operation}} with the United States should be {{continued in the}} research of nuclear fission. Charles C. Lauritsen, a Caltech physicist working at the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>London</b> during this time and was invited to sit in on a MAUD meeting. The committee pushed for rapid development of nuclear weapons using gaseous-diffusion as their isotope separation device. Once {{he returned to the}} United States, he was able to brief Vannevar Bush, the director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), concerning the details discussed during the meeting.|$|E

5|$|The first Guardian {{video was}} shot on {{a digital camera}} by an {{investment}} fund manager from New York who <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>London</b> on business, and who attended the protests out of curiosity. On his way to Heathrow airport, {{he realized that the}} man he had filmed being assaulted was the man who had reportedly died of a heart attack. At that point, 2 am on 7 April, he passed his footage to The Guardian, which published it on its website that afternoon. The newspaper passed a copy to the IPCC, which opened a criminal inquiry.|$|E
5|$|After the KCA raised {{sufficient}} funds, in February 1929 Kenyatta {{sailed to}} Britain from Mombasa. Grigg's administration could not legally prevent Kenyatta's journey but instructed London's Colonial Office not {{to meet with}} him. Arriving in London, Kenyatta initially stayed at the West African Students' Union premises in West London, where he met Ladipo Solanke. He then lodged with a prostitute; both this and Kenyatta's lavish spending brought concern {{from members of the}} Church Mission Society. His landlord subsequently impounded his belongings due to unpaid debt. In the city, Kenyatta met with W. McGregor Ross at the Royal Empire Society, with Ross briefing him on how best to deal with the Colonial Office. Kenyatta became friends with Ross' family, and accompanied them to social events in Hampstead. He also contacted anti-imperialists active in Britain, including the League Against Imperialism, Fenner Brockway, and Kingsley Martin. Grigg <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>London</b> at the same time and, despite his opposition to Kenyatta's visit, agreed to meet with him at the Rhodes Trust headquarters in April. At the meeting, Kenyatta raised the land issue and the exile of Thuku, with the atmosphere between the two being friendly. However, following the meeting Grigg got Special Branch to begin monitoring Kenyatta.|$|E
5|$|After the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660, Scotland regained its kirk, {{but also}} the bishops. Under the Rescissory Act 1661, {{legislation}} was revoked back to 1633, removing the Covenanter gains of the Bishops' Wars. But an act passed later the same day renewed the discipline of kirk sessions, presbyteries and synods, suggesting that a compromise was possible. The restoration of episcopacy was proclaimed by the Privy Council of Scotland on 6 September 1661. James Sharp, minister of Crail, who <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>London</b> to represent {{the interests of the}} Resolutioners, changed sides and accepted the position of Archbishop of St. Andrews. He was consecrated along with Robert Leighton as Bishop of Dunblane and two other bishops. Soon an entire bench of bishops had been constructed. During the parliamentary session of 1662 the Church of Scotland was restored as the national church and all office-holders were required to renounce the Covenants. Church ministers were forced to accept the new situation or lose their livings. Up to a third, at least 270, of the ministry refused. Many ministers chose voluntarily to abandon their own parishes rather than wait to be forced out by the government. Most of the vacancies occurred in the south-west of Scotland, an area particularly strong in its Covenanting sympathies. Some of the ministers also took to preaching in the open fields in conventicles, often attracting thousands of worshippers.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{opted to}} field an {{unchanged}} lineup for the Second Test at Lord's, {{the home of}} cricket. Before the match, Barnes wagered £8 at 15/1 on himself to score a century, and trained especially diligently in the lead-up to the Lord's fixture. He was motivated because the Australian Board of Control had given his wife rare permission to attend the match, and the refusal of the authorities at Lord's {{to allow him to}} practise there when he <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>London</b> a year earlier; Barnes saw a strong personal performance as an ideal response to what he regarded as a snub. On the first morning, Bradman won the toss and elected to bat, and Barnes continued his run of low scores since the First Test. The first over bowled by Bedser to Barnes was watchfully played to complete a maiden. The debutant Alec Coxon opened the bowling with Bedser and removed Barnes for a duck in his second over, caught by Len Hutton at short fine leg. Barnes tried to knock the short delivery through square leg but misjudged the pace of the wicket and played his shot too early, mishitting the ball to Hutton, and leaving Australia at 1/3. They eventually reached 350 and bowled England out for 215 early on the third day.|$|E
5|$|B-29s {{began to}} arrive over Yawata at 00:38 local {{time and the}} attack on the city lasted almost two hours. Only 15 of the American {{aircraft}} were able to aim their bombs visually as the city was blacked out and obscured by smoke or haze; the other 32 bombed by radar. Two further B-29s bombed Laoyao harbor and another five struck targets of opportunity; overall 107 tons of bombs were dropped during the raid. After the first bombs were released regular updates on the operation were transmitted to the Twentieth Air Force's headquarters in Washington, from where they were relayed to Arnold who <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>London</b> at the time. The raiders were met with heavy but inaccurate anti-aircraft fire and the searchlights stationed around Yawata were not effective. The 4th Air Regiment achieved the only kill of the night when one of its fighters shot down a B-29. The Regiment's other aircraft struggled to make contact with the bombers and achieved few interceptions.|$|E
5|$|Born in Northamptonshire, England, Richardson {{originally}} {{served with}} the British Army's Royal Regiment of Artillery as a non-commissioned officer before being transferred to New Zealand to instruct artillery units there. He eventually resigned from the British Army and was commissioned an officer in New Zealand's military. He <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>London</b> {{at the time of}} the outbreak of the First World War and served in the Siege of Antwerp and the Gallipoli Campaign with the Royal Naval Division. He then transferred to the New Zealand Expeditionary Force and served as its administrator in the United Kingdom. He continued to serve in the military until his retirement with the rank of major general. In March 1923, he was appointed Administrator of Western Samoa and served in this capacity for five years. Towards the end of his time in Samoa, he ineffectually dealt with increasing civil unrest in the country. Retiring in 1928, he returned to New Zealand and became involved in local body politics in Auckland until his death in 1938.|$|E

5|$|Gandhi, at age 22, {{was called}} to the bar in June 1891 and then left London for India, where he learned {{that his mother had}} died while he <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>London</b> and that his family had kept the news from him. His {{attempts}} at establishing a law practice in Bombay failed because he was psychologically unable to cross-examine witnesses. He returned to Rajkot to make a modest living drafting petitions for litigants, but he was forced to stop when he ran foul of a British officer. In 1893, a Muslim merchant in Kathiawar named Dada Abdullah contacted Gandhi. Abdullah owned a large successful shipping business in South Africa. His distant cousin in Johannesburg needed a lawyer, and they preferred someone with Kathiawari heritage. Gandhi inquired about his pay for the work. They offered a total salary of £105 plus travel expenses. He accepted it, knowing that it would be at least one year commitment in the Colony of Natal, South Africa, also a part of the British Empire.|$|E
5|$|In {{the post-war}} period, {{following}} {{the invention of}} long-playing records, Tosca recordings were dominated by Maria Callas. In 1953, with conductor Victor de Sabata and the La Scala forces, she made the recording for EMI which for decades has been considered {{the best of all}} the recorded performances of the opera. She recorded the role again for EMI in stereo in 1964. A number of Callas's live stage performances of Tosca were also preserved. The earliest were two performances in Mexico City, in 1950 and 1952, and the last <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>London</b> in 1965. The first stereo recording of the opera was made in 1957 by RCA Victor. Erich Leinsdorf conducted the Rome Opera House orchestra and chorus with Zinka Milanov as Tosca, Jussi Björling as Cavaradossi and Leonard Warren as Scarpia. Herbert von Karajan's acclaimed performance with the Vienna State Opera was in 1963, with Leontyne Price, Giuseppe Di Stefano and Giuseppe Taddei in the leading roles.|$|E
5|$|On 16 February 1722, Cantillon married Mary Mahony, {{daughter}} of Count Daniel O'Mahony—a wealthy merchant and former Irish general—spending {{much of the}} remainder of the 1720s travelling throughout Europe with his wife. Cantillon and Mary had two children, a son who died at an early age and a daughter, Henrietta, who would go on to marry William Howard Earl of Stafford in 1743. Although he frequently returned to Paris between 1729 and 1733, his permanent residence <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>London.</b> In , his residence in London was burned to the ground, and it is generally assumed that Cantillon died in the fire. While the fire's causes are unclear, the most widely accepted theory is that Cantillon was murdered. One of Cantillon's biographers, Antoine Murphy, has advanced the alternative theory that Cantillon staged his own death to escape the harassment of his debtors, appearing in Suriname under the name Chevalier de Louvigny.|$|E

5|$|After Becket's {{election}} as archbishop, Foliot was nominated to the Diocese of London, {{to which he}} was translated on 6March 1163. His nomination had been put forward by the king, who wrote to the pope stating that Foliot would be more accessible as an adviser and confessor if he <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>London,</b> rather than in Hereford on the Welsh Marches. Becket wrote to Foliot urging him to accept the translation. His transfer was confirmed by Pope Alexander III on 19 March 1163 and Foliot was enthroned at London on 28April 1163. Papal confirmation was required because the movement of bishops from one see to another was still frowned on at this time. The medieval chronicler Ralph de Diceto, who was a canon at London, states that the cathedral chapter at St Paul's Cathedral, London, the cathedral of the London diocese, approved of Foliot's selection. Becket was unable to attend Foliot's enthronement, and Foliot did not make a profession of obedience to the archbishop, arguing that he had already sworn an oath to Canterbury when he became Bishop of Hereford, and thus no further oath was required. The issue was sent to the papacy, but the pope refused to be pinned down to an answer. Foliot then attempted to make London independent of Canterbury by reviving Pope Gregory I's old plan for an archbishopric at London. Foliot proposed either to have London raised to an archdiocese along with Canterbury, or to have London replace Canterbury as the archiepiscopal seat for the southern province. Foliot did though support Becket in the latter's attempt to prevent the Archbishop of York having his archiepiscopal cross borne in procession before him when visiting the province of Canterbury.|$|E
