5|$|Because it {{catered to}} gay people, the bar became a {{flashpoint}} for the nascent homophile movement. The Black Cat <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> {{of a legal}} fight {{that was one of}} the earliest court cases to establish legal protections for gay people in the United States. Despite this victory, continued pressure from law enforcement agencies eventually forced the bar's closure in 1964.|$|E

5|$|Galileo's {{discovery}} {{proved the}} importance of the telescope as a tool for astronomers by showing that there were objects in space to be discovered that until then had remained unseen by the naked eye. More importantly, the discovery of celestial bodies orbiting something other than Earth dealt a blow to the then-accepted Ptolemaic world system, which held that Earth <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of the universe and all other celestial bodies revolved around it. Galileo's Sidereus Nuncius (Starry Messenger), which announced celestial observations through his telescope, does not explicitly mention Copernican heliocentrism, a theory that placed the Sun {{at the center of the}} universe. Nevertheless, Galileo accepted the Copernican theory.|$|E
5|$|Janet (stylized as janet.) is {{the fifth}} studio album by American {{recording}} artist Janet Jackson, released on May 18, 1993, by Virgin Records America. Prior to its release, Jackson <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of a high-profile bidding war over her recording contract. In 1991, her original label A sought to renew her contract, while others, such as Atlantic, Capitol, and Virgin all vied to sign her. After meeting with Virgin owner Richard Branson, she signed with the label. The contract was worth an astronomical $40 million dollars, making her the world's then-highest paid musical act.|$|E

5|$|Hampered by terrible pain in {{his left}} knee during the 1960–61 NHL season, Plante was sent down to the minor league Montreal Royals. Torn {{cartilage}} was found in his knee, and the knee was surgically repaired {{during the summer of}} 1961. The next season Plante became only the fourth goaltender to win the Hart Memorial Trophy – he also won the Vezina Trophy for the sixth time. The 1962–63 season was unsettling for Plante. His asthma had worsened, and he missed most of the early season. His relationship with his coach, Toe Blake, continued to deteriorate because of Plante's persistent health problems. Later, Plante <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of a major controversy when he claimed that net sizes in the NHL were not uniform, thus giving a statistical advantage to goaltenders playing for the Chicago Black Hawks, Boston Bruins, and New York Rangers. His claim was later confirmed {{as the result of a}} manufacturing error.|$|E
5|$|In the 1920s, the old Butler Wright house {{became the}} golf house. It <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of the club's {{sporting}} operations, originally holding a pro shop, dining room, bar, and bedrooms. In 1931, it was refurbished with more showers and dressing rooms, {{an addition to}} the locker room to double its space and increase the lounge space, an enlarged kitchen, a new women's locker room and sitting room, a larger dining veranda, an enclosed porch on the northwest corner of the building, and a new porch on the building's east side. The club's first pool was constructed adjoining the house in 1930, necessitating the construction of the showers and dressing rooms. The building was demolished in 1967.|$|E
5|$|Martha was {{described}} as being friendly, feisty and fun loving. Martha's appearance has evolved throughout her time in the show: she was initially a tomboy who loved sport, but she later became a stylish woman. Upon her return in March 2005, Martha's storylines saw her surviving a helicopter crash, having an abortion and a miscarriage, battling alcoholism, being {{diagnosed with breast cancer}} and becoming a widow after her husband was shot. In a controversial storyline Martha worked as a pole dancer; the scenes were criticised by the broadcasting regulator for their content. Whilst playing Martha, Gordon <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of a number of personal scandals, which put her future in the show in doubt. In January 2010, it was announced that Gordon was leaving the show and Martha departed on 9 June 2010.|$|E

5|$|The first {{room from}} the {{corridor}} was the living room, with a wainscot, pilasters, cornice, and door and window frames all of Spanish cedar, and a mantelpiece imported from an Italian chateau. Walls are paneled in green silk, mirroring the rug and furnishings. In its early history, the walls were inlaid with embossed Italian leather. The drawing room, {{sometimes referred to as}} the music room, salon, or parlor <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>center,</b> with paneled walls in ivory white and gold, with gilded moldings and ornaments. There are richly interlaced panels above the doorways with paintings inserted in them. The mantle dates to around 1700, and is of mottled purple and white marble, and has a built-in mirror above it. The room has richly gilt chandeliers hanging from ornamental reliefs in the otherwise plain ceiling. Furniture was of tapestry and gold, with a light rug and yellow and gold curtains at the windows and doors.|$|E
5|$|This {{family of}} white horses {{produced}} Old King in 1908, a dark-eyed white stallion that {{was purchased by}} Caleb R. and Hudson B. Thompson. Old King was bred to Morgan mares to produce a breed of horse known today as the American White Horse. A grandson of Old King, Snow King, <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of the first major study of the dominant white coat color in horses, conducted in 1969 by Dr. William L. Pulos of Alfred University and Dr. Frederick B. Hutt of Cornell. They concluded, based on test matings and progeny phenotype ratios, that the white coat was dominantly inherited and embryonic lethal in the homozygous state. Other factors, such as variations in expressivity {{and the influence of}} multiple genes, may have influenced the progeny ratios that Pulos and Hutt observed. The white coat of the American White Horse has not yet been mapped.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} factor was the {{development in the}} late 18th and early 19th centuries of museums with large natural history collections. These museums received specimens from collectors {{around the world and}} served as centers for the study of comparative anatomy and morphology. These disciplines played key roles {{in the development of a}} more technically sophisticated form of natural history. One of the first and most important examples was the Museum of Natural History in Paris, which <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of many of the developments in natural history during the first decades of the 19th century. It was founded in 1793 by an act of the French National Assembly, and was based on an extensive royal collection plus the private collections of aristocrats confiscated during the French revolution, and expanded by material seized in French military conquests during the Napoleonic Wars. The Paris museum was the professional base for Cuvier, and his professional rival Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. The English anatomists Robert Grant and Richard Owen both spent time studying there. Owen would go on to become the leading British morphologist while working at the museum of the Royal College of Surgeons.|$|E

5|$|The squash {{house was}} {{constructed}} around 1920, completed in 1931, and was demolished between 2011 and 2013. It was {{located near the}} Logan Riding Ring, on the club's south entrance road. It was two stories high, five bays wide and nine bays deep, and was stucco-covered with a flat roof. There were two entrances on the main (south) facade, one at ground level and another on the balcony. The entrances had double wooden doors, paneled below and glazed above. All of the building's windows consisted of wood-framed, paired casement windows with brick sills. A veranda with Tuscan piers extended {{the length of the}} main facade, interrupted by a two-bay-wide, one-bay-deep projection east of the main entrance. The building's interior contained a doubles court, two singles courts, a reception room, locker rooms, showers, and a spectators' gallery seating 150. Across the road from where the building stood is an outdoor riding ring enclosed by a rough rail fence. To the west of the building's site, standing alone in the tall grass, is a 16th-century post-and-lintel stone element, which <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of the stage of a 1,500-seat outdoor Greek amphitheater {{that was part of the}} Shepard estate and was since dismantled.|$|E
