50|$|A clothes <b>line</b> or <b>washing</b> <b>line</b> is {{any type}} of rope, cord, or twine that has been {{stretched}} between two points (e.g. two sticks), outside or indoors, above {{the level of the}} ground. Clothing that has recently been washed is hung along the line to dry, using clothes pegs or clothespins. <b>Washing</b> <b>lines</b> are attached either from a post or a wall, and are frequently located in back gardens, or on balconies. Longer <b>washing</b> <b>lines</b> often have props holding up sections in the middle due to the weight of the usually wet clothing.|$|R

5000|$|In 1928, Jacobson, as {{publicity}} {{director at}} Universal Pictures, created the Laemmle Novelties, {{a series of}} thirteen one-reel-silent films. Jacques Rollens directed. Surprising for the time, the films had no beautiful faces. In Wooden Soldier the characters are toys. The heroine of Rag Doll is just what the title implies and Wax Figures reveals the astounding adventures {{of a group of}} store window dummies. Monkey Shines sees life {{through the eyes of a}} pair of monkeys at the zoo. In <b>Wash</b> <b>Line</b> Romance a <b>wash</b> <b>line</b> is the title character; the people who wear what is hanging on the <b>wash</b> <b>line</b> do not appear except as hands and feet. The hero of Prodigal Pup is a dog. Other titles in the series: Footprints, Faces, Bottles, Handicapped, Shadows, Daydreams, and Half Holiday.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} focused on portal car wash lines and associated processes, control systems, SCADA control systems and visualization, communication between master PLC and SCADA system. The thesis contains research concerning this topic, laboratory example design and its realization. Reader will become acquainted with SCADA systems and ControlWeb which also belongs to the SCADA systems group. Detailed description of the designed program along with its features, control design using PLC and virtual model of the car <b>wash</b> <b>line</b> controlled by the PLC is also {{to be found in}} this work. Both of these two parts have been developed using ControlWeb. Regarding the complexity, the laboratory example was designed only as a demonstration, which differs from a real life solution. All the operations associated with the model are represented only as memory entries inside the PLC, no physical input output operations have been performed here. However, the designed control program is ready to be used in real physical model, the financial side would be significant...|$|E
40|$|The Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, in {{collaboration}} with Oxford University, has developed a European environmental classification for the assessment and monitoring of {{effects of climate change}} on biodiversity at different spatial scales. The classification was constructed using various multivariate techniques from the database for 5500 half by half degree cells for the wider European window, developed by the University of East Anglia (UEA) for the TIGER programme. A statistical rule set created from the classification allows any cell size down to 1 x 1 km to be allocated to one of the 64 classes from its climate and altitude characteristics. Currently, this procedure has been used at its original resolution of half by half degree cell size across Europe and at a 10 x 10 km cell size across Great Britain. A number of climate change scenarios from different climate models provided by UEA have been assessed using the allocation procedure. By using the outputs from these climate models, the predicated movement of climate classes can be determined throughout Europe and at higher resolution for Great Britain. At the European scale, the greatest predicted changes in environmental diversity occur in Iberia and around the Mediterranean fringe. These areas show substantial decreases in the diversity of the region indicated by a fall in the number of classes present mainly due to the extension of two arid classes. The other major changes are in Northeast Europe where large uniform classes were sensitive to the scenarios but the implications are more difficult to determine. Using the half x half degree resolution, major changes can be seen in Great Britain with areas north and west of the Severn / <b>Wash</b> <b>line</b> becoming more oceanic where as those to the south and east becoming more continental. When the same scenarios are imposed in Great Britain using the 10 x 10 km resolution a new climate class was identified as being present whose distribution is centred in eastern Denmark. This is because the half by half degree cells smooth local variation. Two hyper-oceanic classes also extended to the east with implications biodiversity. The different scenarios show climate classes with continental affinities moving into Britain agreeing with other results from the TIGER programme. This ability to draw on classes from outside the immediate domain is an important feature of this classification when carrying out assessment at a local scale. Within Great Britain particular areas are seen {{to be sensitive to the}} predicted change when using the higher resolution e. g. the Cairngorm plateau is affected by the extension of oceanic classes. Such changes have important implications for vegetation, habitats and biodiversity. Isolated populations of plants at the edge of their distribution are likely to be affected by such changes because there are no refuges to retreat to. Further implications of the scenarios will be considered in conjunction with the recent empirical evidence of climate change. Further applications of the classification will also be discussed...|$|E
50|$|The name, Die Wasgoedlyn (The <b>Washing</b> <b>Line),</b> {{was chosen}} for two reasons. The first being that a <b>washing</b> <b>line</b> (in literal terms) is not usually {{a place where you}} would take your guests. It is usually in your {{backyard}} where things are a lot less presentable than the front (street view) of your house. In the same vain Die Wasgoedlyn attempts to unearth these raw performances of artists in a space (mentally and physically) that they take comfort in - in which {{they do not have to}} pretend. The second reason is that on a <b>washing</b> <b>line</b> you'll find a large variety of items, from work-shirts to church-blouses, patched socks, vest with holes in it, underwear from Jockey, petticoats, etc. Die Wasgoedlyn is as much about putting the artist in their most natural surrounding as it is about surrounding them with other artists - enabling the somewhat mystical bond between creatives to flourish resulting in instinctive collaborations.|$|R

Objectively, they are no worse than previous weapons but they hint at a dark Sci-fi future of unseen forces, undetected robots in the sky waiting to strike. The Freestone Drone is an artist’s response to drones. However, George Barber’s Freestone Drone is an unusual drone, he can talk - like Thomas the Tank engine. And like Thomas too, he disobeys orders and causes confusion and delay. The Freestone Drone has a conscience too. The Freestone Drone is a lyrical reaction to the apprehension that drones are eliciting worldwide.
