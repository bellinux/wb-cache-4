40|$|Abstract: With AS 7799 {{accreditation}} {{and certification}} schemes now firmly in place, the AS 7799 standard may ultimately become a benchmark against which all organizations will be measured. In addition, {{the number of}} organizations that employ wireless technology in their businesses has significant increased {{in the last few}} years. However, there is little research about wireless security under AS 7799. There are several article about the vulnerability of WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy), a <b>wireless</b> <b>protocol.</b> This motivates us to study the wireless security compliance in the standard. In this study, we carried out experiments to test if theoretical attacks against WEP, a <b>wireless</b> <b>protocol,</b> work in the real world.
