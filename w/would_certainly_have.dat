5|$|Her qualities were {{portrayed in}} {{literature}} when Lady Rosebery was {{reputed to be}} the model for Marcella Maxwell in Mrs Humphry Ward's novels Marcella (1894) and Sir George Tressady (1909). The author lived at Stocks close to Lady Rosebery's home at Mentmore and <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> known her, while in the books Marcella's house is based on Hampden House, also in Buckinghamshire.|$|E
5|$|Language and {{personal}} names provide some difficulties. The former {{is an important}} indicator of culture but {{there is very little}} direct evidence for its use in specific circumstances during the period under consideration. Pictish, Middle Irish and Old Norse <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> been spoken and Woolf (2007) suggests that a significant degree of linguistic balkanisation took place. As a result, single individuals often appear in sources under a variety of different names.|$|E
5|$|This {{refers to}} the Seven Sleepers, the Catholic legend of seven Christian {{children}}, persecuted for their faith {{during the reign of}} the Roman emperor Decius, who fled to the shelter of a cave where they slept for more than 200 years. Donne, one of six or seven children and a baptised Catholic during a time of strong anti-Catholic sentiment from both the populace and the government, <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> been familiar with the story.|$|E
50|$|It {{was heavily}} implied that had Charmaine been brought {{back into the}} boardroom, she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> been fired.|$|R
60|$|Had he {{fallen to}} the rocky bottom he <b>would</b> most <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> been killed.|$|R
5000|$|Abu Sufyaan {{thought to}} himself, [...] "By Allaah! I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>certainly</b> lied <b>had</b> I not feared {{being called a}} liar." ...|$|R
5|$|Galba {{may have}} chosen to award Halotus the lucrative procuratorship {{for any number of}} reasons; during his reign, Galba was known for making often unpopular {{political}} and economical actions, supposedly for what was, at least in Galba's mind, the financial health of the city. Halotus' great rise in status, and his subsequent prosperity, may have been in some way beneficial in Galba's eyes. Less specifically, the move <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> had some degree of benefit for Galba in some way, whether indirectly, or directly, economically or financially.|$|E
5|$|On 7 May {{he became}} the 107th non-commissioned officer to receive his CFS certificate. He passed as Second Class Flier. He {{was good enough to}} be {{selected}} as an instructor and took his first pupil after having flown only nine hours of solo flight himself. Two of his pupils included the future ace and 56 Squadron colleague Geoffrey Hilton Bowman and Mick Mannock. Soon afterwards, while teaching a student in the Airco DH.1 in which they were flying, the aircraft entered a dangerous spin. McCudden narrowly avoided a crash, pulling up feet above the ground. An impact <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> killed them both.|$|E
5|$|While Maud is {{described}} in the book as an attractive young woman, not a deformed monster, Uncle Silas is carefully written and plotted, and it is almost certain that Le Fanu explicitly intended a comparison between Maud's situation and {{the legend of the}} wealthy woman living in isolation and desired only for her money. Le Fanu spent his entire life in Dublin and was editor and proprietor of the Dublin University Magazine, and <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> been familiar with the legends of the pig-faced woman, and in particular the case of Griselda Steevens.|$|E
60|$|The usual quiet {{glance at}} Anteek {{had such an}} effect on that youth that he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>certainly</b> {{exploded}} <b>had</b> he not been struck by an idea which displaced all tendency to laugh.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't take it--it's yours by right, Diana. You {{sent the}} story in and made the alterations. I--I <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> never <b>have</b> sent it. So you must take the check." ...|$|R
60|$|JOURNALIST. Not at all, sir. We {{felt that}} you <b>would</b> almost <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> good reasons {{of your own}} which would put the matter in quite a {{different}} light.|$|R
5|$|Asad's {{resolution}} in confronting the khagan, and the wise strategic choice of making Balkh his residence, paid off, and {{allowed him to}} salvage a situation that, {{in the wake of}} several defeats {{at the hands of the}} Turgesh, appeared seemingly hopeless—indeed, Caliph Hisham is said to have been incredulous at the first news of Asad's victory. The victory at Kharistan consolidated the Arab position in Khurasan, and particularly in Tokharistan, where the local rulers <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> gone over to the Turgesh if the latter had won or remained unopposed. Conversely the defeat diminished the prestige of Suluk, and may possibly have played a role in his assassination early in 738, although rivalries between the Turgesh, fanned by the Chinese court, were more directly responsible for it. The Turgesh khaganate then collapsed into infighting, and stopped being a serious threat to Arab interests in the area. As a result, the Battle of Kharistan is considered a turning point for the Arab fortunes in Central Asia.|$|E
5|$|Bede {{sometimes}} {{included in}} his theological books an {{acknowledgement of the}} predecessors on whose works he drew. In two cases he left instructions that his marginal notes, which gave {{the details of his}} sources, should be preserved by the copyist, and he may have originally added marginal comments about his sources to others of his works. Where he does not specify, it is still possible to identify books to which he must have had access by quotations that he uses. A full catalogue of the library available to Bede in the monastery cannot be reconstructed, but it is possible to tell, for example, that Bede was very familiar with the works of Virgil. There is little evidence that he had access to any other of the pagan Latin writers—he quotes many of these writers but the quotes are almost all {{to be found in the}} Latin grammars that were common in his day, one or more of which <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> been at the monastery. Another difficulty is that manuscripts of early writers were often incomplete: it is apparent that Bede had access to Pliny's Encyclopedia, for example, but it seems that the version he had was missing book xviii, as he would almost certainly have quoted from it in his De temporum ratione.|$|E
25|$|Orthography. The {{spelling}} of {{many words}} {{differs from the}} classical, which Jordanes <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> known. For example, Grecia replaces Graecia; Eoropam, Europam; Atriatici, Adriatici.|$|E
50|$|In addition, as {{the solitary}} eagles have been merged into Buteogallus, the prehistoric Amplibuteo <b>would</b> almost <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> to be merged herein too, {{as it is}} hardly {{distinct}} from Harpyhaliaetus.|$|R
60|$|Dias {{was very}} pleased when, on coming up that morning, he heard of what had happened. He quite agreed that the other men <b>would</b> almost <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> taken to the mountains.|$|R
6000|$|The {{two young}} people greeted each other affectionately, and {{momentarily}} blocked the Dover Street Tube exit in doing so. The adjective [...] "old" [...] was misleading. Their united ages <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> not <b>have</b> totalled forty-five.|$|R
25|$|He <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> {{played in}} the 1900 tour to England, {{probably}} as captain, but he was serving in South Africa, {{taking part in the}} Second Boer War. He joined the 20th Brigade, becoming a Major in the Royal Artillery, but fell ill and never saw service.|$|E
25|$|A snowball Earth has {{profound}} implications in {{the history}} of life on Earth. While many refugia have been postulated, global ice cover <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> ravaged ecosystems dependent on sunlight. Geochemical evidence from rocks associated with low-latitude glacial deposits have been interpreted to show a crash in oceanic life during the glacials.|$|E
25|$|Aradobo – {{based on}} either Joseph Johnson, the first {{publisher}} to employ Blake as a copy-engraver, {{or one of}} the book seller Edward brothers (James, John and Richard). In 1784, James and John had opened a book shop in Pall Mall, with Richard as their apprentice, and Blake <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> been familiar with the shop.|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{think the}} fact that the {{president}} of the Republic was here was important. I think it was good he decided to come. If he hadn't come, Turkey <b>would</b> almost <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> won".|$|R
5000|$|... {{the company}} had {{neglected}} to commission a HAZOP (HAZard and OPerability) analysis of the heat exchange system, which <b>would</b> almost <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> highlighted the risk of tank rupture caused by sudden temperature change; ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are right. As I was saying, {{but for us}} the {{privilege}} of smiting Comrade Cyclone Al. Wolmann under the fifth rib on Friday night <b>would</b> almost <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> been denied to him." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{body parts}} of the large lepidosaurian in the stomach had been made more {{digestible}} by biting them into pieces. According to Dal Sasso & Maganuco the hatchling <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> been incapable of achieving this and they considered it a strong indication of parental care as it was improbable the animal had by chance encountered a carcass neatly ripped apart into easily swallowed bits by predators or scavengers.|$|E
25|$|Csonka claims that, as {{he walked}} away from the huddle, he told Pisarcik he would not take the ball if he went through with it. It is not known whether the quarterback heard him or not, however. McVay's headphones, which {{normally}} allowed him to communicate with Pisarcik and Gibson, were not working properly at that point either. McVay has since stated that he <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> overruled Gibson had he heard what was coming.|$|E
25|$|Though he {{has managed}} to remain clean and sober for {{extended}} periods in recent years, Osbourne has frequently commented on his former wild lifestyle, puzzled at how he has survived 40years of drug and alcohol abuse. Upon being fired from Black Sabbath in 1979, Osbourne spent the next three months locked in his hotel room taking vast amounts of alcohol and other drugs all day, every day. He claims that he <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> died if his future wife Sharon had not offered to manage him as a solo artist.|$|E
5000|$|Fifty-seven {{people were}} killed during the {{eruption}}. [...] Had the eruption occurred one day later, when loggers {{would have been at}} work, rather than on a Sunday, the death toll <b>would</b> almost <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> been much higher.|$|R
50|$|Mary S. Hall {{believes}} that Har's name {{is derived from}} Jacob Bryant's A New System or Analysis of Antient Mythology (1776), where Bryant conflates the Amazonian deities Harmon and Ares with the Egyptian deity Harmonia, wife of Cadmus. Blake had engraved plates for the book in the early 1780s, so he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> been familiar with its content.|$|R
5000|$|By Sept. 1944, Speer was {{disillusioned with}} the war, the Nazi Party and Hitler himself. Yet, at his trial, Speer states, [...] "If Hitler had had any friends, I <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{been one of}} his close friends." [...] Despite being {{one of the few people}} to stay close to Hitler until the end, he [...] "undercut" [...] Hitler's {{scorched}} earth policy to prevent the complete destruction of Germany and occupied territories.|$|R
25|$|The Scottish army's {{casualties}} went unrecorded as it {{was composed}} largely of historically nameless infantry soldiers, {{but there was one}} very significant loss: Andrew Moray. The defeat of Surrey at the Battle of Stirling Bridge was the zenith of Moray’s campaign against King Edward. He was not a skilled soldier by accident. The training for knighthood that he had received would have equipped him, as a baron's son, with the skills to fulfill a leadership role in Scotland's feudal host and <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> included the skills to lead and direct large groups of soldiers on the battlefield.|$|E
25|$|When the {{earthquake}} hit, the third {{game of the}} 1989 World Series baseball championship was about to begin. Because of the unusual circumstance that both of the World Series teams (the San Francisco Giants and Oakland Athletics) were based in the affected area, many people had left work early or were staying late to participate in after work group viewings and parties. As a consequence the normally crowded freeways contained unusually light traffic. If traffic had been normal for a Tuesday rush hour, injuries and deaths <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> been higher. The initial media reports failed {{to take into account}} the game's effect on traffic and initially estimated the death toll at 300, a number that was corrected to 63 in the days after {{the earthquake}}.|$|E
25|$|However, in {{the early}} Gothic revivalist period of 1838–40, when the chapel for Abney Park was designed, {{the use of the}} gothic style <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> {{conveyed}} a 'high church' note in conventional architectural circles. This implies that Collison and Hosking may have used the style as a deliberate architectural counterpoise to what some critics saw as their 'non western' or 'non Christian' style of entranceway ('Egyptian Revival'). Those who interpreted the chapel's gothic affiliations in this contemporary way, might therefore have considered the chapel to contribute 'balance' to the cemetery's entrance ensemble, underpinning the cemetery company's overall philosophy of nondenominational harmony, and reflecting the ecumenical leanings of Isaac Watts who had lived at the parkland estate a century before.|$|E
5000|$|The ... {{result of}} the {{injunction}} was that BBC Radio One ceased playing Shoes and what <b>would</b> almost <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> been a Top Ten record languished in the lower regions of the Top Fifty for a week before dropping out.|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} kings did not reign {{over the}} southern kingdom, and they <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> not <b>have</b> been honored with a tumulus ceremony in Jerusalem; if any ceremonies were held for them, {{they would have}} transpired in the north (near Bethel, Tirzah, or Samaria).|$|R
5000|$|Prince Friedrich of Hesse and by Rhine (1870-1873). Died {{before his}} third {{birthday}} of bleeding {{on the brain}} resulting from a fall from a third-story window (which <b>would</b> almost <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> been fatal {{even if he had}} not had haemophilia).|$|R
