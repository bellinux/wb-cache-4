In addition, officials set up tents to house 40,000homeless persons. Meanwhile, city officials appealed for additional food, medicine, and construction materials. Gerald Ford, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> U.S. president, agreed to provide aid for victims of Hurricane Liza; the first of which arrived late on October2, containing food and construction materials.

5|$|The {{design of}} a federally-supported {{residential}} school system relied on the expert advice of several prominent Canadian and British statesmen. Sir Peregrine Maitland, a British soldier and colonial administrator, first proposed boarding schools in 1820, believing that civilizing Indigenous children, rather than adults, {{was the best way}} to influence cultural change. Residential schools focused on imparting industry and knowledge were proposed again in 1845 in a report that had been commissioned by Governor General Charles Bagot, entitled Report on the affairs of the Indians in Canada. Referred to as the Bagot Report, it is seen as the foundational document for the federal residential school system. It was supported by James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin, who had been impressed by industrial schools in the West Indies, and Egerton Ryerson, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> Chief Superintendent of Education in Upper Canada.|$|E

5|$|The {{resulting}} album, titled Dark Days, {{was released}} in the United States and Japan in July 2001, through Artistdirect and EMI, while it {{was released in}} Europe, through Locomotive Music, a year later. Rather than releasing the album under his own name, McKagan readopted the Loaded moniker. They announced three dates at the House of Blues taking place in Anaheim, California, Las Vegas, Nevada, and West Hollywood, California (where they were joined onstage by Slash) in November 2001, adding Mike Squires and Jeff Rouse, who replaced Dederer, to the lineup on lead and bass guitar, respectively, while Feveyear performed keyboards and percussion.

5|$|To succeed Davis, the Covent Garden board chose Bernard Haitink, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> musical {{director}} of the Glyndebourne Festival. He was highly regarded for the excellence of his performances, though his repertory was not large. In particular, he was not known as an interpreter of the Italian opera repertoire (he conducted no Puccini and only five Verdi works during his music directorship at Covent Garden). His tenure began well; a cycle of the Mozart Da Ponte operas directed by Johannes Schaaf was a success, and although a Ring cycle with the Russian director Yuri Lyubimov could not be completed, a substitute staging of the cycle directed by Götz Friedrich was well received. Musically and dramatically the company prospered into the 1990s. A 1993 production of Die Meistersinger, conducted by Haitink and starring John Tomlinson, Thomas Allen, Gösta Winbergh and Nancy Gustafson, was widely admired, as was Richard Eyre's 1994 staging of La traviata, conducted by Solti and propelling Angela Gheorghiu to stardom.|$|E
