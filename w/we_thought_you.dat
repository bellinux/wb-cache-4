500|$|Settling in London, Geldray took up British citizenship, {{and worked}} {{on a number of}} BBC radio programmes, such as Workers' Playtime, Melody Magazine and Forces' All-Star Bill. In 1951 he {{provided}} the musical interludes for a new BBC series Crazy People, a comedy show that starred Harry Secombe, Peter Sellers, Spike Milligan and Michael Bentine. Crazy People changed its name for subsequent series to The Goon Show and Geldray was a regular performer in the remaining nine series. The show followed a successful format of a vague plot interspersed by two musical performances; the BBC were using the same structure for a number of radio series, including It's That Man Again (ITMA). In The Goon Show, the musical segments were taken up by Geldray and The Ray Ellington Quartet, with Geldray also playing [...] "Crazy Rhythm" [...] for the play-out music. On occasions Geldray was given lines to perform, although he felt uncomfortable doing so, and his lack of acting ability became a long-running joke within the programme. Geldray was also the butt of some of the Goons jokes and humour: he was referred to throughout the programmes as [...] "Conk", on account of his nose, and his performances were often humorously dismissed by the announcer Wallace Greenslade, with such comments as: [...] "That was Mr Max Geldray playing a harmonica. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> ought to know what it was, anyhow." ...|$|E
500|$|... 8701 was {{recorded}} in the United States, in the cities of Los Angeles, New York, Minneapolis and Atlanta. The album's production was handled by several producers including The Neptunes, Jermaine Dupri, P. Diddy—who had produced the majority of Usher's previous album, My Way—Babyface, Kevin [...] "She'kspere" [...] Briggs, Mike City, Bryan Michael Cox and Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis. Both Jam and Lewis were asked by Usher's mother, and then manager, to contribute to 8701s production, during the 2000 MTV Music Awards. According to Jam, his mother had said [...] "Oh my God, Usher's got this track and <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> guys would be perfect to produce it". Several months later, Jam and Lewis produced the song [...] "Separated", along with multi-platinum producers Ric Atari & Daron Jones (who also wrote the record) to which the producers then turned in to L.A. Reid, who liked the track, {{and asked them to}} produce more. Following this, Usher asked both producers to create a song similar to their 1985 [...] "Tender Love", performed by R vocal group Force MDs. Though he wanted it to be his own unique record, which contains a small similarity, to which Jam and Lewis created [...] "Can U Help Me". Following the completion of 8701, Jam and Lewis were sent back to the studio by Reid to revamp the album's second single [...] "U Remind Me", explaining [...] "we already know he can dance, and he's got the style and that whole thing. But I want people to just go, he can sing.|$|E
2500|$|In 2016, Lovely Warren, {{the mayor}} of Rochester, put a red, white and blue sign next to Anthony's grave the day after Hillary Clinton {{obtained}} the nomination at the Democratic National Convention; the sign stated, [...] "Dear Susan B., <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> might {{like to know that}} for the first time in history, a woman is running for president representing a major party. 144 years ago, your illegal vote got you arrested. It took another 48 years for women to finally gain the right to vote. Thank you for paving the way." [...] The city of Rochester put pictures of the message on Twitter and requested that residents go to Anthony's grave to sign it.|$|E

2500|$|There remains {{uncertainty}} {{as to the}} two sides' {{capability to}} have carried on the conflict much longer. Collins told Hamar Greenwood after signing the Anglo-Irish Treaty: [...] "You had us dead beat. We could not have lasted another three weeks. When we were told of the offer of a truce we were astonished. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> must have gone mad". However he stated on the record that [...] "there will be no compromise and no negotiations with any British Government until Ireland is recognised as an independent republic. The same effort that would get us Dominion Home Rule will get us a republic." [...] At no time had the Dáil or the IRA asked for a conference or a truce.|$|E
2500|$|In 216, Cao Cao {{launched}} another {{campaign to}} attack the southeastern warlord Sun Quan, leading to the Battle of Ruxu in 217. Lady Bian, Cao Pi, Cao Rui and Princess Dongxiang all followed Cao Cao on the campaign, but Lady Zhen remained in Ye because she was sick. When Cao Pi and Lady Zhen's children returned to Ye in late 217 after the campaign, Lady Bian's attendants were {{surprised to see that}} Lady Zhen was very cheerful. They asked, [...] "Lady, you've not seen your children for about a year. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> would miss them and be worried about them, but yet you're so optimistic. Why is that so?" [...] Lady Zhen laughed and replied, [...] "Why should I be worried when (Cao) Rui and the others are with Madam (Lady Bian)?" ...|$|E

6000|$|Wyndham bowed. [...] "We value your {{friendship}} and particularly your honesty and tact. There {{is a matter}} <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> might arrange for us." ...|$|E

6000|$|They both {{rolled on}} to their feet in an untidy sort of manner, when we came in, and said, 'Halloa, Murdstone! <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> were dead!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is indeed}} Geoffrey Vickars!" [...] Sir Francis Vere exclaimed. [...] "Why, Geoffrey, what miracle is this? <b>We</b> have <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> dead these six years, {{and now we}} find you transmuted into a Spanish don." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We are {{out for a}} spin on our wheels," [...] said Ida, [...] "and we {{are very}} thirsty. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> perhaps <b>you</b> would be kind enough {{to give us a}} drink of water." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Sancho!" [...] Cortez exclaimed, as Roger ran up. [...] "Is it <b>you?</b> <b>We</b> all <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> {{had fallen}} in the fight on the causeway. I am {{glad to see that}} you are safe. How did you escape?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "If <b>we</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> were a traitorous German, {{we might}} have left you to shift for yourself," [...] added Randy. [...] "Although maybe I wouldn't have had the heart to do that, either," [...] he added, on second thought.|$|R
6000|$|... "Was--was {{that what}} you meant, that day <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> dying, when you said to me--for it was to me you spoke, to me alone--that it was better so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Before we go further, Miss Bulstrode," [...] said Jack Herring, [...] "it will {{be best to}} {{tell you}} that all along <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> were your brother, dressed up as a girl." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, sure," [...] assented Jacob cordially. He felt {{a little}} dazed.
