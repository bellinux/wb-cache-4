5000|$|There {{are also}} {{stand-alone}} small hole drilling EDM machines with an x-y axis {{also known as}} a super drill or hole popper that can machine blind or through holes. EDM drills bore holes with a long brass or copper tube electrode that rotates in a chuck with a constant flow of distilled or deionized water flowing through the electrode as a flushing agent and dielectric. The electrode tubes operate like the wire in wire-cut EDM machines, having a spark gap and wear rate. Some small-hole drilling EDMs are able to drill through 100 mm of soft or through hardened steel in less than 10 seconds, averaging 50% to 80% wear rate. Holes of 0.3 mm to 6.1 mm can be achieved in this drilling operation.

40|$|Assured {{safety and}} {{operational}} reliability of post-tensioned concrete components {{of nuclear power}} plants are of great significance to the public, electric utilities, and regulatory agencies. Prestressing tendons provide principal reinforcement for containment and other structures. In {{this phase of the}} research effort, the feasibility of developing a passive surveillance system for identification of ruptures in tendon wires was evaluated and verified. The concept offers high potential for greatly increasing effectiveness of presently-utilized periodic tendon condition surveillance programs. A one-tenth scale ring model of the Palo Verde nuclear containment structure was built inside the Structural Laboratory. Dynamic scaling (similitude) relationships were used to relate measured sensor responses recorded during controlled <b>wire</b> <b>breakages</b> to the expected prototype containment tendon response. Strong and recognizable signatures were detected by the accelerometers used. It was concluded that the unbonded prestressing tendons provide an excellent path for transmission of stress waves resulting from wire breaks. Accelerometers placed directly on the bearing plates at the ends of tendons recorded high-intensity waveforms. Accelerometers placed elsewhere on concrete surfaces of the containment model revealed substantial attenuation and reduced intensities of captured waveforms. Locations of wire breaks could be determined accurately through measurement of differences in arrival times of the signal at the sensors. Pattern recognition systems to be utilized in conjunction with the proposed concept will provide a basis for an integrated and automated tool for identification of wire breaks...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study numerically the {{mechanical}} behaviour of wire ropes, particularly {{the influence of}} the geometrical configuration on the overall stiffness of the cables. Modelling the behaviour of a cable is a difficult problem, given the complexity of the geometrical layout, contact phenomena occurring among wires and possible yielding of the material. For this reason we pursue a “hierarchical beam approach”, to substitute recursively, at each cabling stage, the bundle of wires with an equivalent single strand, having the characteristics computed from the previous level. We consider the first two levels of the bundle hierarchy and investigate the case of longitudinal stretching, as a representative application of the method for the problem at hand. To this aim, we perform a certain number of numerical experiments on a bundle of wires, by varying their twist pitches. In this way we compose a set of data to train suitable Artificial Neural Networks, so that, given the twist pitches and the applied longitudinal displacement in input, the ANNs give us the longitudinal reaction force, the bundle axial rotation or the overall axial stiffness. These results can be used “directly” to search for geometrical configurations that offer a significant improvement in stiffness, assuming that a higher stiffness will reduce strand bending and <b>wires</b> <b>breakage.</b> Furthermore, they can be used to obtain the characteristics of the single, equivalent beam that we need for our approach...|$|R

5000|$|In wire {{electrical}} {{discharge machining}} (WEDM), also known as wire-cut EDM and wire cutting, a thin single-strand metal wire, usually brass, is fed through the workpiece, submerged in a tank of dielectric fluid, typically deionized water. Wire-cut EDM is typically used to cut plates as thick as 300mm and to make punches, tools, and dies from hard metals that are difficult to machine with other methods. The wire, which is constantly fed from a spool, is held between upper and lower diamond guides. The guides, usually CNC-controlled, move in the x-y plane. On most machines, the upper guide can also move independently in the z-u-v axis, giving rise to the ability to cut tapered and transitioning shapes (circle on the bottom, square at the top for example). The upper guide can control axis movements in x-y-u-v-i-j-k-l-. This allows the wire-cut EDM to be programmed to cut very intricate and delicate shapes. The upper and lower diamond guides are usually accurate to 0.004 mm, and can have a cutting path or kerf as small as 0.021 mm using Ø 0.02 mm wire, though the average cutting kerf that achieves the best economic cost and machining time is 0.335 mm using Ø 0.25 mm brass wire. The reason that the cutting width is greater than the width of the wire is because sparking occurs from the sides of the wire to the work piece, causing erosion. This [...] "overcut" [...] is necessary, for many applications it is adequately predictable and therefore can be compensated for (for instance in micro-EDM this is not often the case). Spools of wire are long — an 8 kg spool of 0.25 mm wire is just over 19 kilometers in length. Wire diameter can be as small as [...] and the geometry precision is not far from ± [...] The wire-cut process uses water as its dielectric fluid, controlling its resistivity and other electrical properties with filters and de-ionizer units. The water flushes the cut debris away from the cutting zone. Flushing {{is an important factor in}} determining the maximum feed rate for a given material thickness.Along with tighter tolerances, multi axis EDM wire-cutting machining centers have added features such as multi heads for cutting two parts at the same time, controls for preventing <b>wire</b> <b>breakage,</b> automatic self-threading features in case of <b>wire</b> <b>breakage,</b> and programmable machining strategies to optimize the operation.Wire-cutting EDM is commonly used when low residual stresses are desired, because it does not require high cutting forces for removal of material. If the energy/power per pulse is relatively low (as in finishing operations), little change in the mechanical properties of a material is expected due to these low residual stresses, although material that hasn't been stress-relieved can distort in the machining process.The work piece may undergo a significant thermal cycle, its severity depending on the technological parameters used. Such thermal cycles may cause formation of a recast layer on the part and residual tensile stresses on the work piece. If machining takes place after heat treatment, dimensional accuracy will not be affected by heat treat distortion.|$|E

40|$|Cables play an {{important}} role in cable-stayed systems, but are vulnerable to corrosion and fatigue damage. There is a dearth of studies on the fatigue damage evolution of corroded cable. In the present study, the acoustic emission (AE) technology is adopted to monitor the fatigue damage evolution process. First, the relationship between stress and strain is determined through a tensile test for corroded and non-corroded steel wires. Results show that the mechanical performance of corroded cables is changed considerably. The AE characteristic parameters for fatigue damage are then established. AE energy cumulative parameters can accurately describe the fatigue damage evolution of corroded cables. The failure modes in each phase as well as the type of acoustic emission source are determined based on the results of scanning electron microscopy. The waveform characteristics, damage types, and frequency distribution of the corroded cable at different damage phases are collected. Finally, the number of broken <b>wires</b> and <b>breakage</b> time of the cables are determined according to the variation in the margin index...|$|R

Eight process {{parameters}} namely pulse-on time, pulse-off time, peak current, spark gap set voltage, wire feed, wire tension, water pressure, pulse peak voltage and servo feed are varied to study {{their effect on}} surface roughness and <b>wire</b> <b>breakage.</b> The experiments are conducted using one-factor-at-a-time approach. Moreover, a few random experiments are also carried to study the phenomenon of <b>wire</b> <b>breakage</b> precisely. The study revealed that surface roughness is directly affected by the pulse-on time, pulse-off time, peak- current, spark gap set voltage and wire tension.

40|$|Background: Tension-band wiring {{with metal}} wires is a {{commonly}} used technique to treat transverse patella fractures. <b>Wire</b> <b>breakage</b> and migration may potentially cause complications or morbidities such as nerve irritation or skin impingement. The need of extra wound or surgery for implant removal may be required. We hypothesize that the breakage of patellar tension-band wires {{is related to}} the patient's age and the length of time after fracture fixation. Methods: We retrieved and analysed our 11 years records (from January 1, 2000, to May 31, 2011). The inclusion criteria were: (1) patients with transverse patella fracture treated with tension-band plus cerclage wiring technique, (2) with their metal wires removed in our hospital, (3) unilateral patella fracture, (4) wire removal not due to infection, (5) wire removal after complete fracture union, (6) no fracture distal pole or partial patellectomy with protective wire loop, and (7) known exact date of the initial fracture fixation surgery. We reviewed the reasons of wire removal, the presence of broken or migrated wires upon implant removal, and the time lapse from fracture fixation to removal of wire. Results: A total of 59 cases were recruited and studied. A total of 28 patients had intact wires and 31 patients had broken wires upon implant removal. For the age of patients at fracture fixation, there was no statistically significant difference between the intact wire group and the broken wire group. However, for the length of time from fracture fixation to implant removal, the difference was statistically significant between the two groups of patients. It suggested that the risk of <b>wire</b> <b>breakage</b> increases with time after patellar tension-band wiring. If 12 months was used as a cut-off time, there was a statistically significant association between the duration from fracture fixation to implant removal and the presence of broken wire. There were seven cases of wire migration among the 31 patients with broken wires, and two of them needed an extra open wound at popliteal fossa for implant removal. Conclusions: The risk of patellar tension-band <b>wire</b> <b>breakage</b> was associated with increase time lapse from fracture fixation, but not the patients' age upon fracture fixation. The risk of <b>wire</b> <b>breakage</b> significantly increases after 12 months from the fracture fixation. <b>Wire</b> <b>breakage</b> can lead to further morbidities or complications. Routine removal of wire loops may be indicated. Future prospective longitudinal long-term studies may be required...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the results of bipolar hemiarthroplasty using calcar replacement stem for comminuted intertrochanteric fracture in elderly patients. Materials and Methods: Between March 1998 and March 2008, the clinical records of 79 cases who were older than 75 years of age and underwent bipolar hemiarthroplaty, using calcar replacement stem with figure of eight and cerclage wiring, were reviewed. Their mean age was 82. 4 years(75 - 92 years) and the mean follow-up period was 68 months(24 - 92 months). Results: The mean postoperative Harris hip score was 82. 1 (62 - 92), and preoperative walking ability was recovered in 56 cases(71 %). Bony ingrowth fixation was achieved in 70 cases(89 %), and fibrous stable fixation was in 9 cases(11 %). Stress shields were revealed in 21 cases(27 %). Nonunion of trochanter was found in 3 cases(4 %), and <b>wire</b> fixation <b>breakages</b> were in 3 cases after bony union. The mean duration of bony union was 16. 3 weeks(12 - 38 weeks). Aseptic loosening was observed in 1 case and protrusio acetabuli were in 2 cases.

40|$|Knotted wire fences are {{fabricated}} on specialised machines. The {{input material}} is typically galvanised steel wire. However, {{the quality of the}} input wire used by the Fence Producer is beyond control of the Machine Manufacturer. The problem is that <b>wire</b> strand <b>breakages</b> have been reported during fabrication and subsequent field erection. This is an issue for the Fence Producer because of the lost productivity, and the potential for reputation (brand) damage for both the Manufacturer and Producer. While existing standards do exist for wire, even wire that meets these standards is known to fail during fence fabrication. Thus {{there is a need to}} better understand how the quality of wire affects the manufacturability of fences, and to identify, or if necessary create, a test for wire quality that is able to be conducted by Fence Producers. In this research, samples were obtained from known good and failed fences and wire coils, and subjected to a variety of physical and metallurgical tests. These were then statistically examined and compared to the known fate of the fence, to determine the sensitivity of the test. Four potential tests were evaluated: Tensile strength (UTS), ductility, 3 -point bending, microstructural, impact energy, plus a fifth novel new test called linear torsional ductility (LTD). From these tests, it was evident that the linear torsional ductility test was the most sensitive and reliable indicator for wire quality.

40|$|The ever {{increasing}} demand of silicon solar cells in PV industry calls for minimizing the material loses (kerf) during Si wafer slicing. The currently employed abrasive slicing methods {{are capable of}} slicing similar to 350 mu m thick wafers. Recent research efforts have put forward wire-EDM as a potential method. This work presents an extensive experimentation to understand the parametric effects that give ultra thin wafer while minimizing the kerf-loss and maximizing the slicing rate. Ultra thin wafers of size 130 - 150 mu m were fabricated using wire-EDM while controlling the input energy by avoiding <b>wire</b> or wafer <b>breakage.</b> The kerf-loss was reduced by similar to 50 % (121 mu m) while maintaining a high slicing rate of 1. 05 mm/min.

An increase in open voltage and a decrease in servo voltage increase the slicing rate in frontal direction and cause a decrease in slicing rate in the lateral direction, consequently decreasing the kerf-loss.

40|$|A novel {{technique}} of drawing wire, i. e., dieless wire drawing, {{is described in}} which no conventional reduction dies are used. The wire is passed through a unit having stepped parallel bores filled with polymer melts, the smallest bore diameter being greater than the initial nominal wire diameter. The technique {{eliminates the need for}} a leader <b>wire,</b> prevents <b>breakage</b> during start-up, and eliminates the use of conventional reduction dies and, hence, the problem of die wear. An analysis has been developed for predicting the produced wire sizes for given drawing speeds, the pressure distribution within the unit and the drawing load during the drawing process. The performance of the drawing process is effected by means of the plasto-hydrodynamic action of the polymer melt within the unit. Heat is generated by mechanical dissipation during the drawing process. The effect of this upon the performance of the process is considered by coupling the energy equation into the analysis and allowing the polymer viscosity to be dependent on temperature. Agreement between the theory and experiment is found to be close. To further investigate the performance of the drawing process, an extensive experimental study has been undertaken, in which parameters such as drawing speeds, the temperature of the polymer and type of polymers are varied. Based on the theoretical and experimental results, a microcomputer-based control system for the dieless wire drawing process has been designed and built. A method with which the percentage reduction in area of the wire can be measured on line is proposed. Wires of desired qualities in terms of consistency in diameter over long lengths, or uniform change in area of the wire, are capable of being produced from the new system. A self-tuning controller for determinisic systems is proposed, which has the same structure as a conventional PID controller. The new self-tuning PID controller is based on a generalised self-tuning controller with pole assignment for deterministic systems. Simulation and experimental studies for several examples indicate that the new controller performs well and can be further improved to provide a fundamental method of tuning a PID controller. </p...|$|R
5000|$|The canal was {{designed}} for tub-boats which were 26 by 6.5 ft. The inclines at Thornfalcon, Wrantage and Ilminster were double-acting inclines, consisting of two parallel tracks, each containing a six-wheeled caisson, in which the boats floated. A chain linked the two caissons together, passing round a horizontal drum situated {{at the top of}} the incline. Power for the movement of the boats was provided by over-filling the top caisson, the extra weight causing that caisson to descend and the other to rise. Because the majority of traffic passed up the canal, and a boat displaces its own weight in water (Archimedes' principle), considerably more water passed down the incline than up it. However, the system was still more economical than using locks, and a large new Chard Reservoir supplied the necessary water. The incline at Chard Common was quite different, consisting of a single track, with the tub-boats being carried on a cradle with four wheels. Power was supplied by a Whitelaw and Stirrat water turbine, with a 25 ft head, which used [...] of water per minute. Boats were raised 86 ft in a wheeled cradle up a slope of 1:10.

40|$|Significant {{technological}} advancement of wire {{electrical discharge machining}} (WEDM) process has been observed in recent times {{in order to meet the}} requirements of various manufacturing fields especially in the production of parts with complex geometry in precision die industry. Taper cutting is an important application of WEDM process aiming at generating complex parts with tapered profiles. <b>Wire</b> deformation and <b>breakage</b> are more pronounced in taper cutting as compared with straight cutting resulting in adverse effect on desired taper angle and surface integrity. The reasons for associated problems may be attributed to certain stiffness of the wire. However, controlling the process parameters can somewhat reduce these problems. Extensive literature review reveals that effect of process parameters on various performance measures in taper cutting using WEDM is also not adequately addressed. Hence, study on effect of process parameters on performance measures using various advanced metals and metal matrix composites (MMC) has become the predominant research area in this field. In this context, the present work attempts to experimentally investigate the machining performance of various alloys, super alloys and metal matrix composite during taper cutting using WEDM process. The effect of process parameters such as part thickness, taper angle, pulse duration, discharge current, wire speed and wire tension on various performance measures such as angular error, surface roughness, cutting rate and white layer thickness are studied using Taguchi’s analysis. The functional relationship between the input parameters and performance measures has been developed by using non-linear regression analysis. Simultaneous optimization of the performance measures has been carried out using latest nature inspired algorithms such as multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) and bat algorithm. Although MOPSO develops a set of non-dominated solutions, the best ranked solution is identified from a large number of solutions through application of maximum deviation method rather than resorting to human judgement. Deep cryogenic treatment of both wire and work material has been carried out to enhance the machining efficiency of the low conductive work material like Inconel 718. Finally, artificial intelligent models are proposed to predict the various performance measures prior to machining. The study offers useful insight into controlling the parameters to improve the machining efficiency...|$|R

The voltage, machined feed rate and wire speed were manipulated to find the best combination of WEDM machining parameters. The results show that the surface roughness values increased with increasing of voltage and it’s create higher energy on machining zones and create deeper and wider crates on machined surface. A smoother surface can be achieved by lowering the machine feed rate speed and wire speed can be ignored since it not affected on the microstructure of machined surface. As the conclusion machining process can work efficiently by controlling the machining parameters at an optimal value to avoid the risk of <b>wire</b> <b>breakage</b> when the machining process is being carried out onto a workpiece...|$|E

Decreasing servo voltage results in narrow spark gap {{which results in}} large ionization of spark gap and hence more melting of work material, as a result machining rate increases as shown in Fig.  2 c. Highest machining rate is obtained corresponding to Ton: 118  µs; Ip: 150  A; Toff: 35  µs; SV: 30  V. Increasing the value of Ton, Ip and decreasing Toff and SV beyond these limits, discharge energy increases enough to cause <b>wire</b> <b>breakage.</b>|$|E
