25|$|The saddle {{eventually}} branched {{off into}} different designs {{that became the}} modern English and <b>Western</b> <b>saddles.</b>|$|R
50|$|For a time, Parr and {{his friends}} were {{enthusiastic}} and accomplished polo players, albeit on cow ponies with <b>western</b> <b>saddles.</b>|$|R
25|$|Before a {{horse show}} or other competition, the rider should take extra care {{to clean the}} saddle and polish all metal parts, {{including}} the D-rings, stirrups, stirrup bars and nailheads on an English saddle; and the buckles, dees, and ornamental silver on a <b>Western</b> <b>saddle.</b>|$|E
25|$|Bronc riding – {{there are}} two {{divisions}} in rodeo, bareback bronc riding, where the rider rides a bucking horse holding onto a leather surcingle or rigging with only one hand, and saddle bronc riding, where the rider rides a modified <b>western</b> <b>saddle</b> without a horn (for safety) while holding onto a braided lead rope attached to the horse's halter.|$|E
25|$|The modern <b>Western</b> <b>saddle</b> was {{developed}} from the Spanish saddles that were brought by the Spanish Conquistadors {{when they came to}} the Americas. These saddles were adapted to suit the needs of vaqueros and cowboys of Mexico, Texas and California, including the addition of a horn that allowed a lariat to be tied or dallied for the purpose of holding cattle and other livestock.|$|E
25|$|Cruppers are {{not common}} on <b>western</b> <b>saddles,</b> but some English saddles are {{designed}} with crupper rings, particularly those designed to fit mules.|$|R
25|$|Cowboy polo uses rules {{similar to}} regular polo, but riders compete with <b>western</b> <b>saddles,</b> {{usually in a}} smaller arena, using an {{inflatable}} rubber medicine ball.|$|R
25|$|Trick (or stunt) riding saddles {{are similar}} to <b>western</b> <b>saddles</b> and have a tall metal horn, low front and back, {{reinforced}} hand holds and extended double rigging for a wide back girth.|$|R
25|$|The most {{noticeable}} feature of western style riding {{is in the}} saddle, which has a substantial tree that provides greater support to horse and rider when working long hours in the saddle. The <b>western</b> <b>saddle</b> features a prominent pommel topped by a horn (a knob used for dallying a lariat after roping an animal), a deep seat and a high cantle. The stirrups are wider and the saddle has rings and ties that allow objects to {{be attached to the}} saddle.|$|E
500|$|The saddle {{with a solid}} framework, or [...] "tree", {{provided}} a bearing surface to protect the horse from {{the weight of the}} rider, but was not widespread until the 2nd century AD. However, it made a critical difference, as horses could carry more weight when distributed across a solid saddle tree. A solid tree, the predecessor of today's <b>Western</b> <b>saddle,</b> also allowed a more built-up seat to give the rider greater security in the saddle. The Romans are credited with the invention of the solid-treed saddle.|$|E
2500|$|In the Western {{world there}} are two basic types of saddles used today for horseback riding, usually called the English saddle and the [...] "Stock" [...] Saddle. The best known stock saddle is the American <b>western</b> <b>saddle,</b> {{followed}} by the Australian Stock Saddle. [...] In Asia and throughout the world, there are numerous saddles of unique designs used by various nationalities and ethnic groups.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} {{of design and}} optional equipment elements that were influenced by geographic region, history, use and the body types of horses bred in a given area. Certain stylistic elements seen on some, but not all <b>western</b> <b>saddles</b> include: ...|$|R
50|$|Buckstitching {{is often}} found on {{items such as}} cowboy boots, <b>western</b> <b>saddles,</b> and other leather {{products}} associated with the American frontier. It is {{an alternative to the}} whipstitch, the running stitch, the saddle stitch, the round braid, loop lacing, and appliqué lacing.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} {{of participants in the}} parade are essentially members of the Crow Nation, dressed in traditional wear with eagle feathers, warbonnets, old-time <b>saddles,</b> <b>western</b> <b>saddles,</b> reservation hats, and extravagant beadwork. The beadwork of the Crow Nation is among the most technically proficient in the world.|$|R
2500|$|Bronc riding - {{there are}} two {{divisions}} in rodeo, bareback bronc riding, where the rider is only allowed to hang onto a bucking horse with a type of surcingle called a [...] "rigging"; and saddle bronc riding, where the rider uses a specialized <b>western</b> <b>saddle</b> without a horn (for safety) and hangs onto a heavy lead rope, called a bronc rein, which {{is attached to a}} halter on the horse.|$|E
2500|$|Strap {{parts of}} the saddle, such as the stirrup leathers, billets (on an English saddle) and latigo (on a <b>western</b> <b>saddle)</b> also need conditioning, but it varies by climate. [...] In a dry climate, failure to oil straps may result in {{cracking}} and weakening of the leather, and they can snap or break. [...] In a more humid climate, too much oil may weaken the leather. [...] Properly conditioned leather is neither brittle nor floppy in texture and flexibility.|$|E
2500|$|On an English saddle, leathers {{are quite}} thin, {{only about one}} inch wide. [...] On a <b>western</b> <b>saddle,</b> they are very heavy, three to four inches wide on the side closest to the horse, and even wider, {{expanded}} into a decorative [...] "fender" [...] on the outside (which also protects the rider's legs from the sweat of the horse). [...] Stirrup leathers on other saddle designs fall in between the extremes represented by the English and western saddles.|$|E
50|$|Riders {{typically}} wear western shirts, jeans or show pants, and cowboy boots. Chaps {{are allowed}} {{but not always}} worn. Cowboy hats are traditionally worn, but some riders may choose to wear equestrian helmets. Horse tack typically consists of <b>western</b> <b>saddles,</b> western-style bridles, and saddle blankets. Either a curb or snaffle bit may be used.|$|R

50|$|Endurance saddle: Lighter {{weight than}} most <b>western</b> <b>saddles,</b> often without a horn, has {{a tree that}} spreads the rider's weight out over a large area of the horse's back, thus {{reducing}} pounds per square inch. Often has stirrups hung slightly farther forward, to allow rider {{to get off the}} horse's back when traveling at faster speeds. Designed for long rides at faster speeds than a trail saddle.|$|R
2500|$|Though a <b>western</b> <b>saddle</b> {{is often}} {{considerably}} heavier than an English saddle, {{the tree is}} designed to spread out {{the weight of the}} rider and any equipment the rider may be carrying so that there are fewer pounds per square inch on the horse's back and, when properly fitted, few if any pressure points. [...] Thus, the design, in spite of its weight, can be used for many hours with relatively little discomfort to a properly conditioned horse and rider.|$|E
2500|$|Riders {{must use}} a <b>western</b> <b>saddle</b> and a curb bit, and may only use {{one hand to}} hold the reins while riding. Two hands are allowed if the horse is ridden in a snaffle bit or hackamore, which are only {{permitted}} for use on [...] "junior" [...] horses, defined differently by various breed associations, but usually referring to horses {{four or five years}} of age and younger. Horses are not allowed to wear a noseband or cavesson, nor any type of protective boot or bandage, except during some tests that require a reining pattern.|$|E
2500|$|Western saddles are saddles {{originally}} designed to be used on horses on working cattle ranches in the United States. Used today {{in a wide variety}} of western riding activities, they are the [...] "cowboy saddles" [...] familiar to movie viewers, rodeo fans, and those who have gone on tourist trail rides. The <b>Western</b> <b>saddle</b> has no padding of its own, and must be used with a saddle blanket or pad in order to provide a comfortable fit for the horse. [...] It also has sturdier stirrups and uses a [...] cinch rather than a girth. [...] Its most distinctive feature is the horn on the front of the saddle, originally used to dally a lariat when roping cattle.|$|E

50|$|Both {{blankets}} and pads are used with <b>western</b> <b>saddles,</b> the Australian Stock Saddle and other saddle designs {{with a solid}} tree that covers many square inches of a horse's back. The standard stock pad is square or slightly rectangular, and is designed to show under the saddle, providing both protection and style. These pads come in many colors and designs, and at horse shows may be color-coordinated to the rider's attire.|$|R

The rider {{with his back to}} the camera has a lasso around a brown steer's head, and the other rider has a lasso around the steer's heels. A third man stands off to the left, watching. All three men are wearing cowboy hats and both riders are using <b>western</b> <b>saddles.</b> An arena and fencing are visible in the background...|$|R
2500|$|Saddles were {{improved}} upon {{during the}} Middle Ages, as knights needed saddles that were stronger and offered more support. [...] The resulting saddle {{had a higher}} cantle and pommel (to prevent the rider from being unseated in warfare) and was built on a wooden tree that supported more weight from a rider with armor and weapons. This saddle, a predecessor to the modern <b>Western</b> <b>saddle,</b> was originally padded with wool or horsehair and covered in leather or textiles. [...] It was later modified for cattle tending and bullfighting {{in addition to the}} continual development for use in war. [...] Other saddles, derived from earlier, treeless designs, sometimes added solid trees to support stirrups, but were kept light for use by messengers and for horse racing.|$|E
2500|$|The {{needs of}} the cowboy's job {{required}} different tack than was used in [...] "English" [...] disciplines. Covering long distances, and working with half-wild cattle, frequently at high speeds in very rough, brushy terrain, meant the ever-present danger of a rider becoming unseated in an accident miles from home and support. Thus, the most noticeable equipment difference is in the saddle, which has a heavy and substantial tree (traditionally made of wood) to absorb the shock of roping. [...] The <b>western</b> <b>saddle</b> features a prominent pommel topped by a horn (a knob used for wrapping a lariat after roping an animal), a deep seat and a high cantle. Depending on the local geography, tapaderos ("taps") cover {{the front of the}} stirrups to prevent brush from catching in the stirrups.|$|E
2500|$|The stirrup of a <b>western</b> <b>saddle</b> is more {{difficult}} to remove or replace than the English stirrup and therefore, unless damaged or a different style is desired, the same stirrups usually are kept on {{for the life of the}} saddle itself. [...] The tread is mostly flat, but may be curved at the sides to some degree. [...] The branches are wide at the bottom and narrow at the top, where they are joined by a heavy dowel of wood, or rod of metal. [...] The stirrup leather loops under the rod and a [...] "keeper," [...] a strap with a buckle that wraps around the front and back of the stirrup leather, keeps the stirrup in place. [...] Western stirrups are generally made of leather-covered wood, others of steel, aluminum, or even very strong fiber-reinforced plastic.|$|E

The horse on the right has a star on its forehead. The man on the right is wearing chaps. A fenced arena and another horse are visible in the background. This {{photograph}} was taken at a Loyd Jinkins cutting event...|$|R
50|$|Center fire is {{the rigging}} design placed {{closest to the}} center of the saddle. Historically, it {{replaced}} the full rigging. Center fire rigging is located halfway between the cantle and the fork and was always single-rigged. This type is rarely seen on <b>western</b> <b>saddles</b> today, but was used during the 1800s, and notably on the McClellan saddle of the U.S. Army. The Pony Express saddle also had center fire rigging.|$|R
