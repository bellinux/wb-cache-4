For example, in row L (from LEMON), the ciphertext L appears in column A, which is the first plaintext letter. Next <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> row E (from LEMON), locate the ciphertext X which is found in column T, thus T is the second plaintext letter.|$|E

500|$|Speaking for MTV News, Jay-Z {{responded to}} Braxton's claims: [...] "I wouldn't {{want to take}} it from her. I don't even think like that. My first thought would be, 'Maybe I could call her up, maybe I could get on that record.' The most obvious [...] is it's neither one of our records. It's not like you made an {{original}} idea. She's not in hip-hop, but it happens in hip-hop often. <b>We</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> sample the same thing and my record came out first. I'm sorry. What can I do?" [...] He went on saying that if he had known they were both planning to sample the same Tupac song, he would have arranged a duet with her.|$|E
500|$|While light {{comedy and}} satire might have {{established}} Yiddish theater as a commercially successful medium, it was Goldfaden's higher aspirations for it that eventually earned him recognition as [...] "the Yiddish Shakespeare." [...] As a man broadly read in several languages, he was {{acutely aware that}} there was no Eastern European Jewish tradition of dramatic literature – that his audience was used to seeking just [...] "a good glass of Odobeşti and a song." [...] Years later, he would paraphrase the typical Yiddish theatergoer of the time as saying to him: [...] "We don't go to the theater to make our head swim with sad things. We have enough troubles at home... <b>We</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the theater to cheer ourselves up. We pay up a coin and hope to be distracted, we want to laugh from the heart." ...|$|E
500|$|Films such as Laughing Sinners, Safe in Hell, The Devil is Driving, Merrily <b>We</b> <b>Go</b> <b>to</b> Hell, Laughter in Hell, and The Road to Ruin were provocative {{in their}} mere titles. Studios marketed their films, {{sometimes}} dishonestly, by inventing suggestive tag lines and lurid titles, even {{going so far}} as to hold in-house contests for thinking up provocative titles for screenplays. Commonly labeled [...] "sex films" [...] by the censors, these pictures offended taste in more categories than just sexuality. According to a Variety analysis of 440 pictures produced in 1932–33, 352 had [...] "some sex slant", with 145 possessing [...] "questionable sequences", and 44 being [...] "critically sexual". Variety summarized that [...] "over 80% of the world's chief picture output was … flavored with bedroom essence." [...] Attempts to create films for adults only (dubbed [...] "pinking") wound up bringing large audiences of all ages to cinemas.|$|E

500|$|In 1932, Grant {{played a}} wealthy playboy {{opposite}} Marlene Dietrich in Blonde Venus, directed by Josef von Sternberg. Grant's role {{is described by}} William Rothman as projecting the [...] "distinctive kind of nonmacho masculinity that was to enable him to incarnate a man capable of being a romantic hero". Grant found that he conflicted with the director during the filming and the two often argued in German. He played a suave playboy type {{in a number of}} films: Merrily <b>We</b> <b>Go</b> <b>to</b> Hell opposite Frederic March and Sylvia Sidney, Devil and the Deep alongside Gary Cooper, Charles Laughton and Tallulah Bankhead, Hot Saturday opposite Nancy Carroll and Randolph Scott, and Madame Butterfly with Sidney. According to biographer Marc Eliot, while these films did not make Grant a star, they did well enough to establish him as one of Hollywood's [...] "new crop of fast-rising actors".|$|E

[...] Minaj took to her Twitter, asking fans who {{they would like to}} see portray her love interest in the video. Minaj was interviewed on the set of [...] "Your Love" [...] by MTV News while wearing a pink and purple kimono as a geisha for the video. In the interview, Minaj said, [...] "We wanted to have geisha themes, samurai themes, stuff like that. I wanted to tell a love story. It's just kinda liking a guy, where he's not really for you to like — the forbidden fruit — and me and this other girl happen to like him and <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> war." [...] The video premiered July 21, 2010 on MTV.com. Actor Michael Jai White portrays Minaj's love interest in the video.|$|E
500|$|As soon as Starr {{arrived in}} Delhi he asked Evans {{to take him}} to a doctor because of a {{reaction}} to an inoculation: [...] "When we arrived at the local hospital, I tried to get immediate treatment for him , to be told curtly by the Indian doctor, 'He is not a special case and will have to wait his turn.' So off <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> pay a private doctor ten rupees for the privilege of hearing him say it will be all right". Also there at the same time were Mia Farrow, her sister Prudence and brother John, Donovan, Gyp [...] "Gypsy Dave" [...] Mills, Mike Love, jazz flautist Paul Horn, journalist Lewis H. Lapham, film-maker Paul Saltzman, socialite Nancy Cooke de Herrera, actors Tom Simcox and Jerry Stovin, and dozens of others, all Europeans or Americans. Despite speculation, Shirley MacLaine did not attend and Lennon, who had thought of bringing Yoko Ono, decided against it.|$|E

500|$|As part of {{the secrecy}} campaign, Benedict Cumberbatch denied that he was playing Khan during interviews, {{describing}} Harrison as simply a terrorist with his own purposes, as well as [...] "someone that's activated and manufactured in a way by Starfleet, and it's a scene that has {{come back to haunt}} him." [...] He discussed the character's moral ambiguity saying it fit the adage [...] "one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter," [...] adding parallels to the current world order [...] "whether it's U.S. foreign policy or the actions of some terrorists." [...] Into Darkness writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman added that they used the character of Khan not just for his popularity with the fandom—"It’s so easy to fall into the trap of doing something because you {{think people are going to}} love it. You must come up with what the movie can be on its own and then, if it turns out the villain maybe can be Khan, then you can do it. But you can’t start there."—but for fitting the sequel's theme of [...] "how far will <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> exact vengeance and justice on an enemy that scares us." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Casting Crowns' lead vocalist Mark Hall, {{the concept}} for Come to the Well is the song [...] "The Well". Hall wrote the song {{based on the}} Biblical story of [...] "woman at the well {{and the fact that}} she was {{standing}} there talking to Jesus about water and Jesus was talking to her about water, but they weren't talking about the same water". Hall noted that, in his life, [...] "when I come to Jesus, I've already got my well figured out, I've already got what I think is going to sustain me, I just need him to sprinkle some magic Jesus dust on it and make it work. We have our wells figured and we want Jesus to fix our wells, but our wells are really holes in the ground". Hall argued that instead of using that approach, Christians should [...] "start with Jesus, then <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the world", and said that approach is what the album is about. In writing the album, Hall worked with outside songwriters Steven Curtis Chapman, Matthew West, and Tom Douglas on several tracks; he received writing credit on eleven out of the album's twelve tracks, the exception being [...] "Face Down", which was penned by Hector Cervantes and Marc Byrd.|$|E
500|$|The 2013 World Championships in Athletics, held at Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium in August 2013, were {{overshadowed by}} {{comments}} and protests over {{the law by}} athletes. After winning a silver medal at the event, U.S. runner Nick Symmonds stated that [...] "whether you're gay, straight, black, white, we all deserve the same rights. If there's anything I can do to champion the cause and further it, I will, shy of getting arrested." [...] Swedish athletes Emma Green Tregaro and Moa Hjelmer painted her fingernails in rainbow colors as a symbolic protest. However, Tregaro was forced to re-paint them after they were deemed a political gesture that violated {{the rules of the}} IAAF. In response, she re-painted them red as a symbol of love. Russian pole vaulter Yelena Isinbaeva criticized Tregaro's gesture as being disrespectful to the host country, stating in a press conference that [...] "we have our law which everyone has to respect. When <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> different countries, we try to follow their rules. We are not trying to set our rules over there. We are just trying to be respectful." [...] After Isinbaeva's remarks were characterized as being homophobic, she argued that her choice of words had been misinterpreted by the media, and that she was against the discrimination of gays.|$|E

500|$|In 2010, McAdams starred {{with her}} The Family Stone co-star Diane Keaton and Harrison Ford in the comedy Morning Glory. She played a {{television}} producer attempting {{to improve the}} poor ratings of a morning television program. The film was billed as a starring vehicle for McAdams. She initially felt she was unsuited to the role saying, [...] "I'm not funny. So I said, 'if you need me to be funny, {{you might want to}} look somewhere else'". The film's director Roger Michell had a number of dinners with McAdams and persuaded her to join the cast. Since working with Keaton, McAdams has described her as a mentor figure. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said McAdams [...] "gives the kind of performance <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the movies for" [...] while Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times felt she played [...] "as lovable a lead as anyone since Amy Adams in Junebug" [...] in an otherwise [...] "routine" [...] movie. Lou Lumenick of the New York Post was impressed by [...] "her gift for physical comedy", as was Varietys Andrew Barker. While Manohla Dargis of The New York Times felt she [...] "plays her role exceptionally well" [...] and is [...] "effortlessly likable", it called on Hollywood to give her parts [...] "worthy" [...] of her talent. [...] "Ms.McAdams has to rely on her dimples to get by. She does, but she could do better." [...] The film was a modest commercial success, grossing $58million worldwide from a production budget of $40million. McAdams later expressed her disappointment that the film failed to find a larger audience.|$|E
500|$|The Beatles flew to India in February 1968, {{to visit}} the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's ashram (after first meeting him on 24 August 1967, at the London Hilton hotel). Evans arrived in India {{a few days earlier}} to inspect the ashram, but as soon as Starr got off the plane, he demanded that Evans find a doctor, as his {{inoculation}} shots were causing him pain. Evans: “When we arrived at the local hospital, I tried to get immediate treatment for him , to be told curtly by the Indian doctor, 'He is not a special case and will have to wait his turn.' So off <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> pay a private doctor ten rupees for the privilege of hearing him say 'It will be all right'." [...] Evans wrote in his diary on 17 February 1968: [...] "The press really tried kicking down the gates into the Ashram, the Indian people on the Ashram called me half way through, but as soon as an Indian reporter told me [...] "No bloody foreigner is going to stop me in my own country", I cooled it." [...] Evans' diary says that he enjoyed his time in India: [...] "It's hard to believe that a week has already passed. I suppose the peace of mind and the serenity one achieves through meditation makes the time fly," [...] and that he also enjoyed the food, unlike Starr, who had brought a suitcase full of baked beans with him. After leaving India, Harrison and Evans flew to New York, visiting Bob Dylan and The Band, who were rehearsing at their Big Pink house/studio, in Woodstock.|$|E
