40|$|The ML {{programming}} language restricts type polymorphism to occur {{only in the}} "let-in" construct and requires every occurrence of a formal parameter of a function (a -abstraction) {{to have the same}} type. Milner in 1978 [Mil 78] refers to this restriction, which was adopted to help ML achieve automatic type inference, as a serious limitation. We show that this restriction can be relaxed enough to allow universal polymorphic abstraction without losing automatic type inference. In other words, the language may allow occurrences of a formal parameter to have types that are substitution instances of a generic type.

40|$|The {{objective}} of multiple description coding (MDC) is to encode a source into multiple bitstreams supporting multiple quality levels of decoding. In this paper, we only consider the two description case, where the requirement {{is that a}} high-quality reconstruction should be decodable from the two bitstreams together, while lower, but still acceptable, quality reconstructions should be decodable from {{either of the two}} individual bitstreams. This paper describes techniques for meeting MDC objectives in the framework of standard transform-based image coding through the design of pairwise correlating transforms. The correlation introduced by the transform helps to reduce the distortion when only a single description is received, but it also increases the bit rate beyond that prescribed by the rate-distortion function of the source. We analyze the relation between the redundancy (i. e. the extra bit rate) and the single description distortion using this transform-based framework. <b>We</b> also <b>desc</b> [...] ...|$|R

We describe a simple expected case optimization, when implemented in the NetBSD kernel, improves reassembly performance to 34 instructions (i 386) per fragment if the fragments arrive in FIFO order. IPv 6 disallows router fragmentation but does allow the use of hop-by-hop fragmentation and reassembly at routers to make links with small MTU sizes appear to have larger sizes. Our reassembly algorithm {{can be used to}} implement an efficient form of hop-by-hop reassembly. While hop-by-hop reassembly is conventionally used only to ensure that the MTU of a link is at least 1500 bytes, we show that we can considerably improve end-to-end TCP performance by using hopby -hop reassembly to effectively increase link MTU sizes. Experiments using TCP over a two hop path show an improvement of 42 % using hop by hop reassembly across a 1500 byte link to make its effective MTU 9180 bytes. <b>We</b> also <b>desc</b> [...] ...|$|R

While the class of max-weight type algorithms {{are known to be}} throughput optimal for this problem, they typically incur undesired delay performance. In this paper, we propose the Delay-Efficient SCheduling algorithm (DESC). DESC is built upon the idea of accelerating queues (AQ), which are virtual queues that quickly propagate the traffic arrival information along the routing paths. DESC is motivated by the use of redundant constraints to accelerate convergence in the classic optimization context. <b>We</b> show that <b>DESC</b> is throughputoptimal. The delay bound of DESC can be better than previous bounds of the max-weight type algorithms which did not use such traffic information. We also show that under DESC, the service rates allocated to the flows converge quickly to their target values and the average total “network service lag ” is small. In particular, when there are O(1) flows and the rate vector is of Θ(1) distance away from the boundary of the capacity region, the average total “service lag ” only grows linearly in the network size...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION. Cirrhosis is tipically {{associated}} with a hyperdynamic pattern, similar to sepsis. Although microcirculatory disturbances are common in sepsis, {{they have not been}} well studied in cirrhosis. OBJECTIVES. To study the relationship between muscular microvascular function and the levels of mean arterial pressure (MAP) in critically ill patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis. METHODS. Thenar muscle oxygen saturation (StO 2) and muscle tissue hemoglobin index (THI) were continuously measured by a tissue spectrometer (InSpectraTM Model 650, Hutchinson Technology Inc, MN) in decompensated cirrhotic patients. In 35 patients, 27 (77 %) male, 56 [49 - 62] years, median APACHE II score on ICU admission 17 [16 - 20], and SOFA score on the day of enrolment 10 [8 - 13]; 23 patients (65 %) were Child Pugh C. Vaso-occlusive tests (VOT) (upper limb ischemia induced by a rapid pneumatic cuff inflation around the upper arm) were performed for all of them within 24 hours from ICU admission. The following variables were recorded: StO 2, THI, the slope of the decrease in StO 2 during the occlusion (desc slope; %/sec), the slope of the increase in StO 2 following the ischemic period (asc slope; %/sec), and muscle O 2 consumption (nirVO 2) expressing in arbitrary units using the following formula: - (Descending Slope) * [(Basal THI + Min THI/ 2) ]. We also pre-defined patients' categories as those receiving or not vasopressor agents (VP) or in those having a mean arterial pressure (MAP) = or > 70 mmHg. Data are presented as median [ranges] and count (percentage). RESULTS. Of the 35 patients, 21 (60 %) were in severe sepsis/septic shock and 22 (63 %) patients were treated with vasopressors (noradrenaline or terlipressin). ICU mortality was 49 %. Median MAP was 76 [68 - 81] mmHg. NIRS values showed high StO 2 (84. 3 [80 - 88]%, and normal THI values (10. 7 [8. 7 - 13]), altered desc slope (- 0. 19 [- 0. 25 -(- 0. 14) ] and asc slope 1. 27 ([0. 79 - 2. 03]) values. There was no correlation between MAP (range: 50 - 107 mmHg) and NIRS variables in the global cohort of patients. Nevertheless, we found a weak although significant correlation between asc slope and MAP among patients without VP (r 2 = 0. 07; p = 0. 04). In this subgroup of patients, StO 2 was significantly lower in those (n= 4) with MAP = 70 [50 - 70] mmHg when compared to the others (n= 9) [72 - 107 mmHg] (78 [62 - 81] vs. 86 [81 - 90], p= 0. 02), with a trend also for lower asc slope (p= 0. 07). On the other hand, among patients with MAP > 70 mmHg, <b>we</b> found lower <b>desc</b> slope (- 0. 16 [- 0. 19 /- 0. 14] vs. - 0. 25 [- 0. 28 /- 0. 14], p= 0. 01) and nirVO 2 (90 [71 - 104) vs. 143 [115 - 189], p = 0. 02) among those treated with VP when compared to those without VP. CONCLUSIONS. In decompensated cirrhotic patients, tissue oxygen saturation is related to MAP, unless they are treated with VP. The presence of shock and/or the use of vasopressors may influence microvascular reactivity and muscle oxygen consumption, especially when MAP is higher than 70 mmHg. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|Codes which {{attain the}} sphere packing bound are called perfect codes. The most {{important}} metrics in coding theory on which perfect codes are defined are the Hamming metric and the Johnson metric. While for the Hamming metric all perfect codes over finite fields are known, in the Johnson metric it was conjectured by Delsarte in 1970 's {{that there are}} no nontrivial perfect codes. The general nonexistence proof still remains the open problem. In this work we examine constant weight codes as well as doubly constant weight codes, and reduce the range of parameters in which perfect codes may exist in both cases. We start with the constant weight codes. We introduce an improvement of Roos' bound for one-perfect codes, and present some new divisibility conditions, which are based on the connection between perfect codes in Johnson graph J(n,w) and block designs. Next, we consider binomial moments for perfect codes. We show which parameters can be excluded for one-perfect codes.

40|$|Because {{of their}} {{long-term}} self-renewal ability and functional multi-lineage differentiation capacity, {{stem cells are}} highly attractive c andidates for many applications. Both embryon ic and adult stem cells have been explored as ther apeutic strategies {{in the context of}} tissue regene ration. Over the years, it has become clear that a dult stem cells also possess a wide rang e of immune and inflammation modulating properties. Many research groups have studied the immunologi cal behavior of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in v itro and their role as an adoptive immune reg ulatory cell population in several immune-related disorders. Nowadays, other adult adheren t stem cell populations have been characterized an d are being considered to exhibit more potenc y compared to MSCs. Recently, human multipote nt adult progenitor cells (hMAPCs) have thoroughly been studied and {{have been shown to be}} clear ly distinct from hMSCs. In contrast to hMSCs, hMAP Cs can be expanded for a significantly longer time ¨and – besides mesenchymal cell types & ndash; also differentiate into functional end othelium in vitro and in vivo. Clinical-grade prod uction of MAPCs has been achieved and, curren tly, this proprietary large-scale expanded stem ce ll product (MultiStem®) is being evaluated as¨ an allogeneic ‘off-the-shelf’ stem cel l product in the clinic in the fields of regenerat ive medicine for cardiovascular (acute myocardial¨ infarction; AMI) and neurological diseases (i schemic stroke) and as immunotherapy in immun e-associated disorders [graft-versus-host disease¨ (GvHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell tr ansplantation (HSCT), solid organ transplantation¨ and autoimmunity). Even though administ ration of clinical-grade hMAPCs appears to be ¨safe and well-tolerated, and leads to benefi cial (preliminary) clinical results, data regardin g their immunological behavior in vitro are s carce. A better understanding of the exact immune¨ regulatory mechanism would be very valuable t o optimize future clinical studies on the immunotherapeutic function of hMAPCs and of adult stem cel ls in general. In the presented manuscript, in con tinuation of a former project in this specific res earch line, we addressed the issue by investi gating the reciprocal interaction between (clinica l-grade) hMAPCs and immune cells of a functional h uman immune system in vitro. Given the fact t hat cytotoxic immune effector cells play a cr ucial role in immune homeostasis and in the p athogenesis of some autoimmune diseases, ¨we analyzed the influence of (clinical-grade) hMAPCs on the phenotype and functionality of nat ural killer (NK) cells and CD 8 + cytotoxic T cells¨ (CTLs). The first specific objective of this ¨research was to explore the immunogenic and immun e modulatory properties of (clinical-grade) hMAPCs, with regard to functional cytotoxic responses of ¨NK cells and T cells. More specific, it was quest ioned whether these stem cells of alloge neic origin could act as stimulators, as fore ign target cells or as modulators of NK cells and CTLs. We showed that hMAPCs are not able to induce an antigen-specific ‒ a nd only a minimal anti-CD 3 -redirected ‒ CTL response in vitro. Furthermore, allogene ic hMAPCs were insensitive to antigen-sp ecific CTL-mediated lysis and to killing by r esting KIR-mismatched NK cells, despite expression ¨of some ligands (PVR and ULBP- 2 / 5 / 6) of activatin g NK cell receptors (respectively DNAM- 1 and NKG 2 D). On the other hand, IL- 2 -preactiv ated NK cells efficiently lysed allogeneic hMAPCs. ¨However, increased MHC class I expression af ter IFN-γ-pretreatment of hMAPCs did not res ult in higher MHC-I-dependent allorecognition by C TLs and reduced hMAPC susceptibility to preac tivated NK cell-mediated killing, by shifting the¨ balance towards MHC-I-associated inhibitory N K cell signalling. These results indicate low ¨immunogenicity of (clinical-grade) hMAPCs in vitr o, and suggest that survival of hMAPCs in viv o will primarily be dictated by the inflammat ory status and the cytokine balance in the local microenvironment. Secondly, we proved that hMA PCs exert strong immune suppressive effects, as th ey are able to suppress alloreactive CTL prol iferation and IL- 2 -induced expansion of allogeneic ¨NK cells. The suppressive effect on NK cell proliferation is dose- and IDO-dependent, and is m ore pronounced for hMAPCs than for hMSCs ¨from the same donor. In addition, we observed a reduced cytotoxic function of restin g NK cells and activated CTLs (in an ant igen-specific and anti-CD 3 -redirected cytotoxicity ¨system) in the presence of allogeneic third-party ¨hMAPCs during the lytic effector phase. hMAP Cs also directly and dose-dependently impaired ind uction of CTL cytotoxicity during their priming phase (alloantigen-induced or polyclonal a ctivation) by interfering with their perforin expression. On the other hand, in contrast t o their inhibitory effect on NK cell prolifer ation, hMAPCs had no influence on the intrins ic cytotoxic properties of NK cells during th e IL- 2 -mediated activation phase. Because of compe tition between hMAPCs and K 562 cells as targe t cells for IL- 2 -activated NK cell-mediated k illing, we could not conclude if hMAPCs influ ence the killer function of IL- 2 -activated NK cells during their effector phase. Taken together, our observations imply that (clinical-grade) hMA PCs impair both proliferative and cytotoxic NK and T cell responses, resulting in a lower immun e response in vitro. The second specific goa l of this thesis was to further elaborate the immune modulatory mechanism of (clinical-gra de) hMAPCs and to identify responsible immune ¨regulatory factors and pathways. We demonstrated¨ that the mode of action is multifactorial and ¨depends on the studied immune effector response. ¨ In case of proliferation suppression, we coul d ascribe a partial role to IDO for hMAPC-med iated impairment of NK cell proliferation, in line ¨with previously obtained results for T cell¨ expansion inhibition. In contrast, we could n ot identify a single responsible soluble factor (IDO, PGE 2, IL- 10 and TGF-β) in NK ce ll cytotoxicity suppression. Transwell experiments showed contact-dependency of hMAPCs to¨ exert their suppressive function on T cell cytotox icity. Until now, as is the case for NK cells, we did not detect a single responsible ¨contact-dependent mechanism in hMAPC-mediated T c ell cytotoxicity suppression. Though, <b>we</b> <b>desc</b> ribed for the first time hMAPC expressio n of galectin- 1 and ligands of the immun e inhibitory PD- 1 pathway (PD-L 1 / 2) and¨ of the Fas-mediated apoptosis pathway (FasL). Functional blocking studies however did not confirm the latter two pathways as suppressiv e candidates in CTL function inhibition by hMAPCs. With regard to the suppressed T cell phenoty pe, we observed that the presence of hMAPCs does n ot result in T cell apoptosis or anergy and t hat T cells retain their memory response duri ng a secondary immune reaction after removal¨ of hMAPCs. However, hMAPCs largely disturb th e activation marker expression of T cells. In ¨hMAPC-modulated T cells, CD 69 expression was ¨clearly and persistently increased, in both CD 8 -¨ and CD 8 + T cell populations. Moreover, HLA-DR ¨and CD 25 (IL- 2 Rα) upregulation were signifi cantly decreased in the presence of hMAPCs. hMAPCs ¨downregulated CD 25 expression to a lower ext ent on CD 8 T cells and shifted those cells p ossibly towards a regulatory phenotype. In conclusion, we have provided evidence that (cl inical-grade) hMAPCs are low immunogenic ¨and have potent immunosuppressive effects in ¨vitro on NK cells and CTLs. In addition, we have¨ contributed to a better understanding of the¨ complex immunomodulatory mechanism. Based on these findings, we can state that the rationa le for therapeutic use of hMAPCs or its clinical-g rade counterpart MultiStem as an off-the-shel f adoptive cell population in the context of¨ immune-related disorders is legitimate. These data may represent an extensive co ntribution to the current knowledge and, in combination with the results of future phase II/III ¨trials using MultiStem, will lead to an intriguing continuation of stem cell-based resear ch for immunotherapy. nrpages: 136 status: publishe...|$|E
