5|$|In Oklahoma, {{moisture}} from the storm, combined with a slow-moving cold front, produced heavy rainfall across the state, peaking at 8.98inches (228mm) in Courtney. Due to below normal precipitation {{by as much as}} 5 to 10inches (127 to 255mm), flooding was localized and overall minimal. Near Medford, the rainfall lead to 2feet (0.6m) deep flooding on U.S. Highway 81, forcing its closure. The rainfall was <b>welcome</b> <b>in</b> the state, and lessened the rainfall deficit.|$|E
5|$|Season one {{revolves}} around two main events: Coach Eric Taylor beginning {{as head coach}} and the injury and paralysis of star quarterback Jason Street {{in the first game}} of the season. Coach Taylor's career depends on his ability to get the Dillon Panthers to the state championship, despite the loss of Street. If the team suffers a losing streak, he knows his family will no longer be <b>welcome</b> <b>in</b> Dillon.|$|E
5|$|Taylor {{remained}} at Monterrey until late November 1847, {{when he set}} sail for home. While he would spend the following year {{in command of the}} Army's entire western division, his active military career was over. In December he received a hero's <b>welcome</b> <b>in</b> New Orleans and Baton Rouge, and his popular legacy {{set the stage for the}} 1848 presidential election.|$|E

5|$|The new reign was {{supported}} by the Whigs, who were mostly staunch Protestants. The Tories were suspected of supporting the Catholic Pretender James Francis Edward Stuart. George I rewarded the Whigs by forming a Whig government; at his <b>welcome</b> <b>in</b> Queen's House at Greenwich, he conversed with the Whigs but not with the Tories. Sarah approved of his choice of Whig ministers.|$|E
5|$|These two {{results were}} enough to advance Ireland to the Super 8 stage of the tournament.In their final group stage game, the West Indies beat them by eight wickets. In the Super 8 stage, they lost their four matches against England, South Africa, New Zealand, Australia, and Sri Lanka, but {{recorded}} a 74-run victory against Test playing nation Bangladesh, the 9th ranked team in the world. The team received a heroes' <b>welcome</b> <b>in</b> Dublin.|$|E
5|$|Within days of Operation Berlin, the British {{returned}} to a heroes' <b>welcome</b> <b>in</b> England. A list of 59 decorations was quickly published for the 2,000 men who had returned and an investiture ceremony for the division was held at Buckingham Palace in December. Decorations for the 6000 who had not returned were not published until September 1945 and numbered only 25.|$|E

5|$|According to Packer, {{another common}} theme in Gordimer's novels is the choices {{ordinary}} {{people who live}} in oppressive regimes are forced to make. Literary critics Turgeon and Carli Coetzee explain that when she realises that whites are not always <b>welcome</b> <b>in</b> the anti-apartheid liberation movements, Rosa repudiates her father's struggle and leaves the country. Marsh-Lockett says that part of Rosa's struggle is forging her own identity, and this decision to rebel against her dead father is a bold step, although she does return later to South Africa to become a committed activist and ultimately a political prisoner. But, according to Coetzee, what Rosa achieves is what her father never could: to have a life of her own while still remaining politically committed.|$|E
5|$|After the Oppenheimer controversy, Teller became ostracized by {{much of the}} {{scientific}} community, but was still quite <b>welcome</b> <b>in</b> the government and military science circles. Along with his traditional advocacy for nuclear energy development, a strong nuclear arsenal, and a vigorous nuclear testing program, he had helped to develop nuclear reactor safety standards as {{the chair of the}} Reactor Safeguard Committee of the AEC in the late 1940s, and in the late 1950s headed an effort at General Atomics which designed research reactors in which a nuclear meltdown would be impossible. The TRIGA (Training, Research, Isotopes, General Atomic) has been built and used in hundreds of hospitals and universities worldwide for medical isotope production and research.|$|E
5|$|Continuing to emphasise good {{relations}} with the white settlers, in August 1963 Kenyatta met with 300 white farmers at Nakuru. He reassured them that they would be safe and <b>welcome</b> <b>in</b> an independent Kenya, and more broadly talked of forgiving and forgetting the conflicts of the past. Despite his attempts at wooing white support, he did not do the same with the Indian minority. Like many indigenous Africans in Kenya, Kenyatta bore a sense of resentment towards this community, despite the role that many Indians had played in securing the country's independence. He also encouraged the remaining Mau Mau fighters to leave the forests and settle in society. However, throughout Kenyatta's rule, many of these individuals would remain unemployed, with unemployment being one of the most persistent problems facing his government.|$|E

5|$|Pierce {{was finally}} {{allowed to return}} to Concord in late December 1847. He was given a hero's <b>welcome</b> <b>in</b> his home state and issued his {{resignation}} from the Army, which was approved on March 20, 1848. His military exploits elevated his popularity in New Hampshire, but his injuries and subsequent troubles in battle led to accusations of cowardice which would long follow him. He had demonstrated competence as a general, especially in the initial march from Vera Cruz, but his short tenure and his injury left little for historians to judge his ability as a military commander.|$|E
5|$|Since its {{founding}} Nea Salamina sought to develop friendly {{relations with the}} Turkish Cypriots in Famagusta, and Turkish Cypriots (including Siekkeris, Nita and Moustafa) played during the early 1950s. When the team joined the CFA, it played against Turkish teams (including Demir Sports, Gençlik Gücü and the Mağusa Türk Gücü) in the second division. When Turkish Cypriot clubs began withdrawing from CFA tournaments of CFA in late 1955, the club tried to convince them to continue and Turkish players remained <b>welcome</b> <b>in</b> Nea Salamina. In 1962 Kallikas {{was transferred to the}} club, and in 1970 Neziak (of Turkish origin) was also transferred. In 2004 Turkish Cypriots Imam and Oulousoi were transferred to Nea Salamina, the first Turkish Cypriot footballers in the CAF in thirty years.|$|E
5|$|Wagner's {{involvement}} in left-wing politics abruptly ended his <b>welcome</b> <b>in</b> Dresden. Wagner was active among socialist German nationalists there, regularly receiving such guests as the conductor and radical editor August Röckel and the Russian anarchist Mikhail Bakunin. He was {{also influenced by}} the ideas of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Ludwig Feuerbach. Widespread discontent {{came to a head}} in 1849, when the unsuccessful May Uprising in Dresden broke out, in which Wagner played a minor supporting role. Warrants were issued for the revolutionaries' arrest. Wagner had to flee, first visiting Paris and then settling in Zürich where he at first took refuge with a friend, Alexander Müller.|$|E

5|$|Although Morgan {{had been}} ordered to {{eradicate}} piracy from Jamaican waters, he continued his friendly relations with many privateer captains, and invested in some of their ships. Zahedieh estimates that there were 1,200 privateers operating in the Caribbean at the time, and Port Royal was their preferred destination. These had a <b>welcome</b> <b>in</b> the city if Morgan received the dues owed to him. As Morgan was {{no longer able to}} issue letters of marque to privateer captains, his brother-in-law, Robert Bindloss, directed them to the French governor of Tortuga to have a letter issued; Bindloss and Morgan received a commission for each one signed. Morgan was not entirely friendly to pirates and privateers; in 1681 he ordered an attack on Dutch buccaneer Jacob Evertson, capturing many of his crew (though Evertson escaped) and advertising the capture publicly.|$|E
5|$|In 1909 Harold Oliver {{moved to}} Lyrup, South Australia {{and started a}} farm growing fruit. During this time, he captained the Lyrup {{football}} team. In 1909, after never previously winning a game, the Lyrup football club won the local riverland league premiership. They subsequently traveled to Mildura where they lost twice to the home team. The Mildura Cultivator praised Oliver's marking and kicking reporting that it {{was as good as}} anyone who had played at the ground. An umpire at the game from Melbourne told Harold that he would be <b>welcome</b> <b>in</b> Melbourne to play football if he wanted to. At the end of 1909 Oliver was contemplating moving to Queensland to join his sister in the state but two friends, the Musgrave brothers, who played for West Suburbans in Adelaide suggested he come down and visit.|$|E
5|$|In February 2013, {{planning}} permission for the redevelopment was granted. The {{cost of the}} project was estimated to be around £29.2million, of which £25.2million would come from government funding. It was initially planned for the work to begin in September 2013. Two months later however, Crusaders began legal proceedings against the redevelopment. The club called for the process to be judicially reviewed, believing it to be against European Union competition laws and also a form of State aid towards Linfield. When Crusaders played Linfield at Windsor Park at the end of April, their club officials were allegedly informed {{that they would not be}} <b>welcome</b> <b>in</b> the directors box or the boardroom during the game – an apparent reaction to Crusaders' legal challenge of the stadium redevelopment. In a hearing that took place on 22 May 2013, Crusaders' request was granted. It was ruled that it was a possibility for the redevelopment to be classed as state aid towards Linfield. The aspect of the challenge concerning competition law however, was dismissed.|$|E
