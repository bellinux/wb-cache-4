5|$|Arthur Fiacco, a cellist, {{arrived at}} Carriage House first. He <b>was</b> <b>dressed</b> in formal {{black and white}} attire, having {{traveled}} from an afternoon concert. Fiacco {{was surprised to find}} there were no scores written for the musicians to play; he then wrote a part based on riffs Francis had shown him. The violinists, Corinne Metter and Karen Karlsrud, also followed the directions of Francis and Norton. Another cellist, Ann Rorich, credited on the album and single, was sent home; according to Fiacco he doubled her parts.|$|E
5|$|He <b>was</b> <b>dressed</b> in {{a strange}} way. A šajkača was pulled {{to the front of}} his head and almost {{completely}} covered his forehead. His eyebrows were hardly visible. Under its weight, the ears seemed to have collapsed. He wore a kind of long, black coat, covered in mud and held in place by a string. He used another piece of string for a belt, and from it hung a pot for boiling water, a tea strainer, a canteen, and other useful things. He walked slightly bent forward, followed everywhere by the noise of the things clashing at his waist.|$|E

5|$|Naughty Dog based Drake's {{appearance}} and personality on daredevil Johnny Knoxville, actor Harrison Ford, and {{the heroes of}} pulp magazines, novels and films. To make him relatable, the character <b>was</b> <b>dressed</b> {{in jeans and a}} T-shirt, and given an everyman persona; he is strong-willed, and often jokes and quips. The designers focused on giving him realistic reactions to his environment; for example, he stumbles while running, barely clears objects during leaps, and recognizes the absurdity of the situations in which he finds himself.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the first episode, Wishology includes references from three recent films: The Matrix, The Lord of the Rings, and Harry Potter. In Timmy's first trilogy wish, Timmy—under his alias Teo—is dressed as Neo from The Matrix, while his school teacher, Mr. Crocker, <b>is</b> <b>dressed</b> as Neo's antagonist, Agent Smith. Timmy dodges Mr. Crocker's lasers in a style similar to that seen in The Matrix. [...] After doing so, he jumps off a building and lands on, and crushes, a Volkswagen New Beetle.

In the third, Harry Potter-themed trilogy wish, where everyone is in a Quidditch match, Timmy <b>is</b> <b>dressed</b> as the film's main character, Harry Potter, Vicky <b>is</b> <b>dressed</b> like Voldemort, and Poof {{takes the form of a}} quidditch snitch.|$|R

5|$|Shiina, {{given name}} unknown, {{otherwise}} {{referred to by}} his nickname , is another adult friend of Shuichi and Yoshino. He was Yuki's classmate in elementary school, and he eventually became her boyfriend after her transition. Unlike Yuki, Shiina had many friends in school. He generally just watches over Shuichi and Yoshino with Yuki, but he sometimes does bold and unexpected things, such as grabbing Yoshino's crotch when he first meets Yoshino because he feared that, because Yoshino <b>was</b> <b>dressed</b> as a boy at the time, Yuki might be having an illicit affair with Yoshino.|$|E
5|$|After {{the audio}} launch, the {{positive}} {{reception of the}} song Chinni Chinni Aasalu prompted the makers to release a video featuring {{the making of the}} song. Shot in the backdrop of a village, the song featured Nagarjuna dressed as a farmer while Shriya Saran <b>was</b> <b>dressed</b> as an innocent villager. On the other hand, the video showcased the recording of the song by Shreya Ghoshal. The video too received positive response. A still featuring Chaitanya and Samantha in an intimate sequence from the flashback was re-tweeted many times by the fans and Telugu film websites. A short teaser, 31 seconds long, was unveiled on 13 May 2014, in which Samantha was seen speaking about Nageshwar continuously at a doctors' check up and the montage of the film's male leads being played side by side.|$|E
5|$|Around {{this time}} he adopted his famous style of dressing, {{consisting}} of a knee-length one-piece Kafni robe and a cloth cap. Ramgir Bua, a devotee, testified that Sai Baba <b>was</b> <b>dressed</b> like an athlete and sported 'long hair flowing down {{to the end of}} his spine' when he arrived in Shirdi, and that he never had his head shaved. It was only after Baba forfeited a wrestling match with one Mohiddin Tamboli that he took up the kafni and cloth cap, articles of typical Sufi clothing. This attire contributed to Baba's identification as a Muslim fakir and was a reason for initial indifference and hostility against him in a predominantly Hindu village.|$|E
5000|$|Episode 6: The catwalk was {{all about}} embodying {{specific}} emotions brought out by the clothing. The female models <b>were</b> <b>dressed</b> in deep scarlet clothing and had to portray sensuality and [...] "fire", while the male models <b>were</b> <b>dressed</b> in white and had to embody [...] "ice", or smoothness.|$|R

5|$|Brezhnev rarely {{appeared}} in public during 1982. The Soviet government claimed that Brezhnev was not seriously ill, but {{admitted that he}} was surrounded by doctors. He suffered a severe stroke in May 1982, but refused to relinquish office. On 7 November 1982, despite his failing health, Brezhnev was present standing on Lenin's Mausoleum during the annual military parade and demonstration of workers commemorating the anniversary of the October Revolution. The event would also mark Brezhnev's final public appearance before dying three days later after suffering a heart attack. He was honoured with a state funeral, which was followed with a five-day period of nationwide mourning. He was buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis in Red Square. National and international statesmen from around the globe attended his funeral. His wife and family attended; his daughter Galina Brezhneva outraged spectators by not showing up in sombre garb. Brezhnev on the other hand <b>was</b> <b>dressed</b> for burial in his Marshal's uniform, along with all his medals.|$|E
5|$|For {{slow motion}} scenes like with bullets and drops of water, twin Phantom {{high-speed}} cameras were used which filmed 200 frames per second. A fight scene with Wesker and Chris in the Resident Evil 5 game was recreated shot-by-shot {{for the film}} and the Phantom cameras were used to create Wesker's superhuman speed which took about two days to film. The added size and weight of the 3D cameras meant the filmmakers {{were not able to}} use existing equipment such as Steadicam rigs. Instead the camera operator worked on a Segway to achieve the look of a Steadicam shot. Much of the action scenes were shot in front of a green screen. A 1983 Yak-52 was used throughout the film by Jovovich and Larter. Stunt pilot Martin Mattes <b>was</b> <b>dressed</b> like Jovovich and flew the plane for the camera.|$|E

By 20 August he was well enough to travel, so {{he was sent to}} hospital in Hungary and eventually back to Germany, where he recovered in hospital in Meissen. In October he received promotion to Leutnant der Reserve and was recommended for, but did not receive, the Iron Cross, first class. At his father's request, Hess was transferred to a hospital closer to home, arriving at Alexandersbad on 25 October.|$|E
2500|$|Boys {{take part}} in the procession, playing {{different}} roles associated with Christmas. Some may <b>be</b> <b>dressed</b> {{in the same kind of}} white robe, but with a cone-shaped hat decorated with golden stars, called stjärngossar (star boys); some may <b>be</b> <b>dressed</b> up as [...] "tomtenissar" [...] (Santa's elves), carrying lanterns; and some may <b>be</b> <b>dressed</b> up as gingerbread men.

5|$|I've {{always been}} drawn to her story. More than anything, drawn to her {{commitment}} to what she believed in. In the face of death, she did not back down. And that is a theme that resonates with me. And women need female role models like that. There's not a lot. I mean, she was {{burned at the stake}} after leading her country to victory, after defeating the English. I mean, the idea that instead of celebrating her, they called her a heretic because she <b>was</b> <b>dressed</b> like a boy, and how could this person, this one girl, be so victorious and so clever to have the strategy and knowledge to wage, and win, a war? There must be something wrong with her. OK, she's a witch. Now we have to destroy her. And she didn't back down, and I admire that.|$|E
5|$|James, {{under her}} real name, debuted in WWE on the October 10, 2005 episode of Raw as a face, under the gimmick of WWE Women's Champion Trish Stratus' biggest fan.

The storyline included a Halloween costume contest, in which James <b>was</b> <b>dressed</b> like Stratus and helped Stratus retain the Women's Championship in a Fulfill Your Fantasy battle royal at Taboo Tuesday by eliminating herself and Victoria {{at the same}} time. James even began utilizing Stratus' signature finishing moves as her own during matches. James later became the number one contender for the WWE Women's Championship on December 12, by defeating Victoria in a match to determine who would face Stratus at New Year's Revolution. Subsequently, the storyline between James and Stratus developed into a lesbian angle, after James kissed Stratus under a sprig of mistletoe.
