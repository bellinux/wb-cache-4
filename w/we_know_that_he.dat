5|$|Æthelbert was {{instrumental}} in forming a library at York, which was probably the largest contemporary collection of books {{to be found in}} Europe outside of Rome. Alcuin mentions several Latin and Greek classical authors, as well as the Fathers and other Christian writers that formed the 8th century canon. Æthelbert, in his search for books, travelled far, and <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> visited Rome among other places. Alcuin's poem Versus lists 41 different authors, including some who wrote in Hebrew. He taught both the trivium as well as the quadrivium, plus how to figure the dates of church festivals and natural science.|$|E
5|$|Less {{is known}} of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the {{historical}} Stefan Lochner believe {{he was born in}} Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major city occasion. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40.|$|E
25|$|By 1094, {{when he is}} attested in the synod that {{condemned}} Leo of Chalcedon, Opos {{had risen}} to the dignity of protoproedros. From a seal <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> later rose further to protonobelissimos, and in a manuscript that belonged to him, he is finally recorded as megas doux. Opos is last attested in 1097, during the First Crusade, when he was tasked with preventing the forces of a certain count, Raoul, from crossing the Bosporus, and even engaged in battle with the Crusaders.|$|E
60|$|The Professor began groping {{among his}} apparatus. <b>We</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was looking for}} his purse.|$|R
60|$|David did {{not move}} from his post near the three burglars, but he turned toward Alice and looked at her. <b>We</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had tender {{feelings}} toward the girl, and I think <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did not approve of her being there.|$|R
6000|$|... 'First, {{there was}} a rumour that {{sickness}} was upon him. Next, <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> lay sick in the Palace. A very great multitude stood outside the Palace by night and by day, in the rain {{as well as the}} sun, waiting for news.|$|R
25|$|Aimé De Mesmaeker {{is a rich}} businessman; <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> owns {{a private}} jet (until Gaston destroys it) and that his oldest {{daughter}} drives an Alfa Romeo. His precise line of business is unknown, but he is repeatedly lured into the offices of Spirou by Fantasio or Prunelle in order to sign some lucrative contracts (see below). De Mesmaeker has developed a deep loathing for Gaston and by extension his colleagues. His frequent visits allow Franquin to satirise business rituals, as Dupuis's employees shower him with attention, complimentary drinks, cigars but De Mesmaeker almost inevitably ends up storming out of the offices, swearing never to set foot in them again, {{passed out on the}} floor or even in hospital due to Gaston's catastrophic blunders.|$|E
25|$|His enemies exaggerated his faults; e.g. his {{supposed}} miserliness. In fact, {{it seems}} that his thriftiness {{was the result of}} long years spent in obscurity (when his income was uncertain and scanty) rather than part of his character, because he could also be generous. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> helped his nephew Jean-François when he came to Paris and also helped establish the career of Claude-Bénigne Balbastre in the capital. Furthermore, he gave his daughter Marie-Louise a considerable dowry when she became a Visitandine nun in 1750, and he paid a pension to one of his sisters when she became ill. Financial security came late to him, following the success of his stage works and the grant of a royal pension (a few months before his death, he was also ennobled and made a knight of the Ordre de Saint-Michel). But he did not change his way of life, keeping his worn-out clothes, his single pair of shoes, and his old furniture. After his death, it was discovered that he only possessed one dilapidated single-keyboard harpsichord in his rooms in Rue des Bons-Enfants, yet he also had a bag containing 1691 gold louis.|$|E
500|$|The philosopher Frank J. Leavitt {{has argued}} that the method Bates {{described}} would be difficult to test scientifically due to his emphasis on relaxation and visualization. Leavitt asked [...] "How can we tell whether someone has relaxed or imagined something, or just thinks that he or she has imagined it?" [...] In regards to the possibility of a placebo trial, Leavitt commented [...] "I cannot conceive of how we could put someone in a situation where he thinks he has imagined something while <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has not." ...|$|E
60|$|One of our Minute Boys {{had been}} killed outright, and lay on his face upon the ground within {{a few feet of}} where I stood. How long he had been there no one could say; but <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was alive when we were rejoicing over the first repulse.|$|R
5000|$|American Crossroads {{was accused}} of having {{conflicts}} of interest {{over the role of}} Carl Forti. American Crossroads defended Forti, telling Politico, “Carl is a contract employee with American Crossroads. He has other clients. <b>We</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had other clients. But clearly, none of us are gonna be involved personally in the presidential campaign.” ...|$|R
60|$|We gave a gasp, for <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> must die, and ran {{as hard as}} {{we could}} towards him. In three seconds it had ended, but not as we thought. Khiva, the Zulu boy, saw his master fall, and brave lad as he was, turned and flung his assegai {{straight}} into the elephant's face. It stuck in his trunk.|$|R
500|$|Although he did {{not often}} write or speak about it, Tolkien {{advocated}} {{the dismantling of the}} British Empire and even of the United Kingdom. In a 1936 letter to a former student, Belgian linguist Simonne d'Ardenne, he wrote, [...] "The political situation is dreadful... I have the greatest sympathy with Belgium—which is about the right size of any country! I wish my own were bounded still by the seas of the Tweed and the walls of Wales... we folk do at least know something of mortality and eternity and when Hitler (or a Frenchman) says 'Germany (or France) must live forever' <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> lies." ...|$|E
500|$|Cresswell drew {{praise from}} manager Billy Davies during 2004–05, [...] "Richard is very capable {{of that and}} it is {{important}} that we keep creating chances for Cressy as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will put the ball in the back of the net", although he admitted the team were over reliant on Cresswell's goals. He enjoyed his best goal return in 2004–05, top scoring for Preston with 21 goals in 52 appearances. This helped Preston reach the 2005 Championship play-off Final, where they were beaten 1–0 by West Ham United at the Millennium Stadium. Cresswell played poorly in the first half, but had a number of chances on goal during the second half.|$|E
500|$|Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir {{has been}} {{described}} as possibly Bach's first surviving cantata. [...] For it to be the first, it has to be assumed not only that it predates other cantatas written in Mulhnausen (<b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wrote at least one other there), but also {{that there is not a}} surviving cantata from his previous post at Arnstadt. It seems likely that Bach was composing choral music at Arnstadt. Although Bach was only 22 when he took up the appointment at Mühlhausen, the performance of a work of his own composition appears to have been part of the selection process. [...] Recent scholarship suggests that another surviving cantata Nach dir, Herr, verlanget mich, BWV 150 could have been composed at Arnstadt.|$|E
6000|$|... "We <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a sailor," [...] the Inspector went on, {{dropping}} {{again into}} his sing-song monotone, [...] "by the extraordinary agility needed {{to climb up}} the thirty feet of bare brick wall to the window--a landsman could not have climbed more than twenty; the fact <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was from the East Indies <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> from the peculiar knot about his victim's neck. <b>We</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had a wooden leg----" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "The truth!" [...] he echoed hoarsely. [...] "Don't <b>we</b> all <b>know</b> <b>that?</b> Don't <b>we</b> all <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is to {{give you}} your rights, that you are coming--" ...|$|R
500|$|This {{should not}} be {{confused}} with a value of 0. [...] A null value indicates a lack of a value - a lack of a value is not the same thing as a value of zero in the same way that a lack of an answer is not the same thing as an answer of [...] "no". [...] For example, consider the question [...] "How many books does Adam own?" [...] The answer may be [...] "zero" [...] (<b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> owns none) or [...] "null" [...] (we do not know how many he owns). [...] In a database table, the column reporting this answer would start out with no value (marked by Null), and it would not be updated with the value [...] "zero" [...] until we have ascertained that Adam owns no books.|$|E
2500|$|Because of Arbuthnot's own {{insistence on}} not being recognized, it is {{difficult}} to speak definitively of his literary significance. [...] Dr. Johnson describes him as the 'most universal genius' and <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was at the heart of}} many of the greatest satires of his age. He was a conduit and source for a great many of the finest literary accomplishments for over half a century of writing, but Arbuthnot was zealous that he not receive credit.|$|E
2500|$|Little {{is known}} of Pagondas's life. [...] He is {{mentioned}} by Pindar as having been born to a noble Theban family, and <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was in his early}} sixties at Delium. [...] He was evidently a fiery and persuasive speaker, purportedly moving the disparate Boeotian contingents to unify and attack their Athenian enemies through rhetoric alone. [...] Apart from a brief mention by Thucydides, however, there is very little extant information about Pagondas or his life. [...] He seems to have appeared and abruptly disappeared solely for the Battle of Delium.|$|E
5000|$|He ain't {{mad at the}} niggas <b>that</b> shot him; <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> where they're at. He {{knows who}} shot him. If you ask him, he knows, and {{everybody}} in the street knows, and he's not stepping to them, because <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> not gonna {{get away with that}} shit. To me, that's some real sucker shit. Be mad at everybody, man; don't be using niggas as scapegoats. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> a nice guy from New York. All shit aside, Tupac is a nice, good-hearted guy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dartrey is a {{brilliant}} person," [...] she admitted, [...] "but <b>we</b> all <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is not a practical politician. The battle is between you and Horlock." ...|$|R

2500|$|Scholar Park Honan, in Shakespeare, A Life (1998), concurs {{with the}} view that Shakespeare's biblical {{references}} are essentially conformist, alluding to {{his use of the}} Bishop's Bible in his plays and religious activity in Protestant circles. However, critics of the former point say that Church attendance cannot be taken as a conclusive proof because attendance at Protestant churches was mandatory in the epoch. Hence, Callaghan concludes that [...] "we may not know decisively if Shakespeare was a Catholic, but crucially, neither do <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a stalwart Protestant." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dr. Griffin's {{conspicuous}} army {{service in}} Southern California combined with his sterling personal qualities no doubt {{contributed to his}} rapid rise to leadership in civic and business affairs in Los Angeles, and to his acquisition of a large surgical practice within a few years. Although memorial statements about his career say that he sought new treatments and was not hesitant to discard old methods, we have no specifics as {{to the meaning of}} these generalities and we have no information about his experience with vascular surgery. In any case, <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> sided with [...] [...] [...] [...] timid colleagues and advised against removing the sponge. Assuming that it was not already too late to make a difference, we must conclude that it was Griffin's opinion that sealed the fate of James King of William.|$|E
2500|$|The I Modi {{prints are}} highly pornographic and {{accompanied}} sonnets by Pietro Aretino. They were allegedly created by Giulio Romano as {{paintings in the}} Vatican after a dispute with Pope Clement VII, and the engraver Marcantonio Raimondi published them. The publication caused a furore in Rome, and the pope ordered that all copies be destroyed. [...] As such, there is no known original printing of I Modi in existence. [...] What has survived {{is a series of}} fragments in the British Museum, two copies of a single print, and a woodcut copy from the 16th century. [...] Waldeck claimed to have found a set of tracings of the I Modi prints in a convent near Palenque in Mexico. [...] His story is dubious because there is no such convent. However, <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> saw the fragments now in the British Museum because the fragments can be matched to his drawings.|$|E

6000|$|... "When Mr. Moorsby {{gave the}} order I ran forward. I saw a biggish man {{standing}} {{with his hands in}} the pockets of his pea-jacket. He seemed to be looking on, and was not at work; but, thinking <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might be a leader, me and Harry Wilkens ran at him and seized him. It was not until afterwards <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was Mr. Julian Wyatt. After we had caught him I handed him over to Wilkens, and that is all I know about him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You were mortified, and I was surprised," [...] he went on, [...] "when Mr. Winterfield {{dropped his}} {{acquaintance}} with you. <b>We</b> now <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> acted like an honorable man." ...|$|R

5000|$|Another {{survivor}} of Operation Sombra, Juan Jouvé, described Masetti {{in the following}} way."I never talked about his personal life. <b>We</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had a wife and kids because he mentioned them once. On one occasion he referred to himself in third person. Still, I didn't know who he was, and the photos that they showed me later bore little resemblance to him. When I met him {{he had a big}} black, almost blue, beard. It was hard to get close to him, he was an imposing man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{windows of}} the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That fatal night Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled {{by the smell of}} the strong Indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke. She left her room, therefore, and came into mine, where she sat for some time, chatting about her {{approaching}} wedding. At eleven o'clock she rose to leave me, but she paused at the door and looked back.|$|R
