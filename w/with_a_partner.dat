5|$|Aikido {{techniques}} are usually {{a defense against}} an attack, so students must learn to deliver various types of attacks {{to be able to}} practice aikido <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>partner.</b> Although attacks are not studied as thoroughly as in striking-based arts, sincere attacks (a strong strike or an immobilizing grab) are needed to study correct and effective application of technique.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Hammond {{resigned}} from Marsham's; {{his wife was}} homesick, leading Hammond to plan a business in South Africa <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>partner.</b> However, after moving to Durban, they realised they had insufficient money. He took a job with Denham Motors in Durban, where {{he was forced to}} work much harder than in England. He lost his job in 1959 when the firm went out of business, and the Hammond family again found themselves in financial trouble.|$|E

His brother was Sir Douglas Cameron, who also went into politics, serving in the Ontario Legislature and as Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba. John {{attended}} school in Hawkesbury and Renfrew and in 1871 became a merchant at Vankleek Hill, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>partner</b> in the firm Cameron & Mode General Merchants. In 1876, he went west and relocated to Winnipeg, Manitoba to establish Cameron & Company general merchants, where he remained until 1881.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of group sex composition on individual effort at a feminine task. A simple sewing task was used. Effort was operationalized as the proportion of trials exceeding median practice performance. It was predicted that subjects would work less hard <b>with</b> <b>a</b> female <b>partner</b> when their partner's gender was congruent with traditional sex roles. As predicted, men performed significantly better <b>with</b> <b>a</b> male <b>partner</b> than <b>with</b> <b>a</b> female <b>partner.</b> Contrary to prediction, women performed significantly better <b>with</b> <b>a</b> female <b>partner</b> than <b>with</b> <b>a</b> male <b>partner.</b> Discussion focused on the likelihood of different motivational mechanisms operating for men and women, and on the implications of the findings...|$|R
5|$|Family {{issues were}} {{significant}} concerns for lesbians when gay activism became more vocal in the 1960s and 1970s. Custody issues in particular were of interest since often courts would not award custody to mothers who were openly homosexual, {{even though the}} general procedure acknowledged children were awarded to the biological mother. Several studies performed {{as a result of}} custody disputes viewed how children grow up with same-sex parents compared to single mothers who did not identify as lesbians. They found that children's mental health, happiness, and overall adjustment is similar to children of divorced women who are not lesbians. Sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex roles of children who grow up with lesbian mothers are unaffected. Differences that were found include the fact that divorced lesbians tend to be living <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>partner,</b> fathers visit divorced lesbian mothers more often than divorced nonlesbian mothers, and lesbian mothers report a greater fear of losing their children through legal means.|$|E
5|$|Gee (Yaphet Kotto) tells Pembleton (Andre Braugher), an {{excellent}} detective but a lone wolf, {{that he must}} work <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>partner.</b> Pembleton ends up investigating {{the death of a}} 65-year-old man with rookie detective Bayliss (Kyle Secor). Bayliss initially believes the death to be a heart attack, but Pembleton correctly determines it is a murder because the man's car is missing. Police later arrest a man named Johnny (Alexander Chaplin) who is found driving the dead man's car. During an interrogation, Pembleton fools Johnny into waiving his Miranda Rights, then sneakily persuades him into confessing to the murder. Bayliss, although convinced of Johnny's guilt, nevertheless questions the ethics of Pembleton's approach, prompting Pembleton to yell angrily at him {{in front of the other}} officers. The episode ends with Bayliss responding to his first homicide as the primary detective: the brutal murder of an 11-year-old girl named Adena Watson.|$|E
5|$|The next year, {{he began}} {{printing}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>partner,</b> William Seres; the two based their {{operations at the}} parish of St Sepulchre in London. Day and Seres specialised in religious works, such as those by Robert Crowley, which were largely related to theological controversies of the time. The Protestant Reformation was advancing rapidly, and the laws against the publication of heretical works were being relaxed. In 1548, ten of the twenty works {{that the two men}} published were devoted to criticizing the Catholic belief of transubstantiation. One of those publications, a satirical poem by Luke Shepherd titled Iohn Bon and Mast Person, almost landed Day in jail. Day and Seres also translated important works of Continental Protestantism for the English market, notably Herman von Wied's A Simple and Religious Consultation in 1547.|$|E

40|$|Adolescent {{dating and}} sexual {{activity}} are consistently associated with risk for depression, yet the pathways underlying this association remain uncertain. Using data on 1, 551 sibling pairs (ages 13 – 18) from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, {{the current study}} utilized a sibling comparison design to assess whether adolescent dating, sexual intercourse <b>with</b> <b>a</b> romantic <b>partner,</b> and sexual intercourse <b>with</b> <b>a</b> nonromantic <b>partner</b> were associated {{with higher levels of}} depressive symptoms independent of familial factors. Results indicated that adolescent dating, in and of itself, was not associated with depressive symptoms. The association between depressive symptoms and sexual activity <b>with</b> <b>a</b> romantic <b>partner</b> was fully accounted for by between-family genetic and shared environmental confounds. In contrast, sexual activity <b>with</b> <b>a</b> nonromantic <b>partner</b> was significantly associated with both mean levels of depressive symptoms and clinically severe depression, even within sibling dyads. This relationship was greater for younger adolescents (� 15 years). These results are consistent <b>with</b> <b>a</b> growing body of research demonstrating that relationship contexts may be critical moderators of the psychosocial aspects of adolescent sexual experiences...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of group members' relative task ability on the relationship between group sex composition and member task motivation. Male and female subjects performed a simple motor task <b>with</b> <b>an</b> opposite-sex <b>partner,</b> <b>a</b> same-sex <b>partner,</b> or no partner. Partners had higher, equal, or lower task ability than subjects. When the partner was more able than the subject, both sexes did more work <b>with</b> <b>an</b> opposite-sex <b>partner</b> than when working individually, whereas subjects <b>with</b> <b>a</b> same-sex <b>partner</b> did no more work than individual controls. Group sex composition did not affect member motivation when the partner was equally or less able. These findings disconfirmed several models of the sex composition-motivation relationship. They supported an esteem maintenance model which holds that both sexes place greater value on demonstrating competence to opposite-sex partners than to same-sex partners...|$|R
