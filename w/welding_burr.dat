40|$|AbstractResults of the {{research}} of a stress-deformed state of elements of the stamp to improve tool life in hot stamping of vibration-damping spring ends are described. Some non-theoretical studies using Solid Works software Simulation (SWS), based on the finite elements method (FEM) were carried out after the construction of matrices. It allowed estimating a situation occurring during the deformation process. The results of {{the research}} and testing show that {{the formation of the}} ends of billets with the method of the volumetric hot surface treatment without a <b>welding</b> <b>burr</b> for a single blow is impossible. The innovative technology features a spring coiling program with automatic positioning of rolled ends, hardening with a fast-moving stream of water using industrial robots in the space-surface hardening of the bar...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{strengthen}} or repair the welded structural members or fatigue damaged areas, various surface treatment {{methods such as}} grinding, shot peening and/or hammer peening are commonly employed among other methods available. While the weld toe grinding method is known to give 3 ~ 4 times of fatigue strength improvement, this improvement may significantly vary according to weld bead shapes and loading modes. In this context, a series of fatigue tests is carried out for three types of test specimens that are typically found in ship structures. <b>Weld</b> <b>burr</b> grinding is carried out using an electric grinder in order to remove surface defects and improve weld bead profiles. The test results are {{compared with the same}} type of test specimen without applying the fatigue improvement technique in order to obtain a quantitative measure of the fatigue strength improvement. Moreover, structural stress method is employed {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the method in evaluating the fatigue strength improvement of welded structures...|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} uses for flame {{cleaning}} {{rather than just}} to remove rust and mill scale. It is also used as a removal tool for paints, bad <b>welds,</b> <b>burrs,</b> mechanical wear (scraping, cuts, gouges and more) along with other surface imperfections.The process of flame cleaning is not anything new and does not require any extra equipment than what would {{be found in a}} typical metal shop. It is just an oxygen-fuel torch that is used parallel with the surface to melt and blow off any blemishes that the operator wants to eliminate. Shown in the adjacent diagram, the surface is blasted with the oxygen-fuel torch across the surface versus the orthodox use of the flame as a cutting or gouging tool. Though the equipment is the same, the flame used in cleaning is drastically reduced to prevent excess removal of the surface. Various kinds of fuel can be run with the oxygen, for example acetylene.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{the effect of the}} weld bead {{geometry}} on the fatigue strength of a joint, mainly focusing on geometry change due to post-weld grinding. The <b>weld</b> toe <b>burr</b> grinding usually has a positive effect on the fatigue strength; however, excessive material removal at the weld throat can decrease its strength. This effect was experimentally evaluated and compared with proper numerical estimations. By means of the numerical evaluations of the effective stress, obtained by the implicit gradient method, the estimation of the geometric component of the grinding process is possible. With this procedure, it is possible to analyse a real joint, geometrically modelled by laser scanner acquisition, and also to assess the excessive net section reduction in a grinding operation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} fatigue {{behaviour}} of thin AlMgSi 1 aluminium alloy weldments and {{the improvement in}} fatigue strength due to post-weld treatments. Several fatigue tests were performed using two distinct types of thin welded joints, T and single lap, manufactured using a 6 xxx series aluminium alloy, and the efficiency of fatigue life improvement techniques, such as post-weld heat treatment and <b>weld</b> toe's <b>burr</b> dressing, was studied. Both the post-weld heat treatment and the burr dressing produced a fatigue strength improvement. This fact is discussed, for both geometries, {{in the context of}} the initiation and propagation phases contribution to total fatigue life. Finally, several fatigue tests were performed under variable amplitude block loading using T 6 post-weld heat-treated single lap joints, and the correspondent fatigue lives were compared with the predictions of Miner's rule.
