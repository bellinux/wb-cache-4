40|$|The lack of {{reliable}} stock assessment for numerous exploited stocks in West Africa often results from poor-quality data, high multi-specificity of captures, and {{the heterogeneity of}} exploitation methods. However, many signs of overexploitation exist, particularly for demersai resources, highlighting {{the urgent need for}} a more quantitative and comprehensive evaluation of these resources. This study aims to show how, in such a context of poor-quality data and high uncertainty, a multi-method approach for stock assessment can generate a consistent diagnosis of the condition of a resource. As a case study, several methods were combined to assess the stock status of the <b>white</b> <b>grouper</b> Epinephelus aeneus, a flagship species in West Africa that is exploited by industrial and small-scale fisheries in Mauritania. These were estimation of abundance indices using delta generalised linear models; a biomass production model using a pseudo-equilibrium method and including an environmental effect of upwelling intensity; a dynamic biomass production model fitted in a Bayesian framework also including an environmental effect; and an age-structured model based on a modified pseudo-cohort analysis. Sensitivity analyses were performed for most of these assessment methods.

40|$|The {{growth and}} {{reproductive}} biology of the <b>white</b> <b>grouper,</b> Epinephelus aeneus, were studied in captive fish {{to determine its}} potential for aquaculture. About 250 fish were captured by fishermen along the Mediterranean coast and maintained in 16 m 3 concrete tanks supplied with sea water in a flow-through system. The captive fish fed readily on dry pellets supplemented with chopped frozen fish and gained an average of 3. 3 g/day during the initial growth phase (0. 5 - 1. 5 kg), and 11. 3 g/day during the secondary growth phase (1. 5 - 3. 0 kg). Using ovarian biopsies, the sexual development of 17 females was closely monitored for 3 years, and for 1 year in an additional 47 females. In adult females held in captivity, the oocytes reached {{the final stages of}} vitellogenesis, however, final oocyte maturation, ovulation and spawning did not occur. Sustained release of [-Ala 6,Pro 9 NEt]-GnRH from implanted devices was highly effective in inducing ovulation, but did not result in natural spawning. Repeated implantations resulted in 2 – 3 ovulations per reproductive season, which lasted from April through September. The ovulated females were manually stripped and the eggs were artificially fertilized, resulting in millions of fertilized eggs and larvae. The average fecundity per female was 242 343 eggs (kg BW) − 1 yr− 1. In some of the young females, early vitellogenesis did not lead to the final stages of vitellogenesis. Instead, the vitellogenic oocytes underwent rapid atresia. Monitoring individual fish demonstrated that E. aeneus is a protogynous hermaphrodite, changing sex from female to male, confirming reports by other authors. Sex inversion occurred both spontaneously and after implantation with 17 α-methyltestosterone.

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{identifying}} the food web of the red mullet, Mullus barbatus {{in order to understand}} how it is affected by trawling disturbance. To achieve this objective: a) the main features of the red mullet habitat were investigated; b) the food web of this habitat was studied in two no-trawl areas and in two areas open to trawling. The working hypothesis is that trawling affects the biochemistry of the sediment and the trophic structure of the benthic assemblage. It was predicted: a) less biomass, smaller size and higher production rate in the benthic assemblages of protected gulfs; b) higher average trophic level for both the red mullet and its predators in protected gulfs; c) a diet shift driven by the mechanical disturbance of trawling. The results achieved confirmed our hypotheses and allowed us to characterize {{for the first time the}} trophic web structure in the red mullet habitat in the study area. Results also allowed us to compare the trophic level of red mullet of different sizes using two independent techniques, stable isotopes of nitrogen and gut contents. The average trophic level of the red mullet was higher and the energy consumption per unit of biomass larger in the protected gulfs. Species with a trophic level higher than the red mullet and therefore its potential predators were few and the most important were the <b>white</b> <b>grouper,</b> Epinephelus aeneus, the pandora, Pagellus erythrinus and the common torpedo, Torpedo torpedo...|$|E
40|$|Background: Several {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} clinical benefits of fish consumption for the cardiovascular system. These effects are attributed to the increased amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids in these foods. However, the concentrations of fatty acids may vary according to region. Objective: The goal {{of this study was}} to determine the amount of,cholesterol and fatty acids in 10 Brazilian fishes and in a non-native farmed salmon usually consumed in Brazil. Methods: The concentrations of cholesterol and fatty acids, especially omega- 3, were determined in grilled fishes. Each fish sample was divided in 3 sub-samples (chops) and each one was extracted from the fish to minimize possible differences in muscle and fat contents. Results: The largest cholesterol amount was found in <b>white</b> <b>grouper</b> (107. 6 mg/ 100 g of fish) and the smallest in badejo (70 mg/ 100 g). Omega- 3 amount varied from 0. 01 g/ 100 g in badejo to 0. 900 g/ 100 g in weakfish. Saturated fat varied from 0. 687 g/ 100 g in seabass to 4. 530 g/ 100 g in filhote. The salmon had the greatest concentration of polyunsaturated fats (3. 29 g/ 100 g) and the highest content of monounsaturated was found in pescadinha (5. 98 g/ 100 g). Whiting and boyfriend had the best omega- 6 /omega 3 ratios respectively 2. 22 and 1. 19, however these species showed very little amounts of omega- 3.

40|$|In Senegal, a {{significant}} decrease in catches indicates that many demersal fish stocks are being overexploited. The <b>white</b> <b>grouper</b> Epinephelus aeneus, locally known as the 'thiof', is exploited by both small-scale and industrial fisheries. A 28 -year database of E. aeneus catches along the Senegalese coast provided by the Centre for Oceanographic Research of Dakar-Thiaroye, and size at maturity measured in Dakar (Senegal) from monthly samples in 2010, were used to analyse changes in population structure in the area over the past 37 years. Catches from the northern fishing areas were lower than those from the southern fishing areas, and decreased steadily during the period (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, D = 0. 243, p = 0. 0002). The individual mean weight of catches decreased from 1974 to 2010 (linear regression, r(2) = 0. 40, n = 37) and only 60 % of the individuals were mature. The calculated sizes at maturity were 49 cm total length (TL) for females and 55 cm for males, and the optimal length of capture for a sustainable fishery was 96 cm, but only 0. 03 % of E. aeneus caught reached this length. Most of the catch consisted of juveniles; the larger reproductive individuals had disappeared. The number of individuals caught decreased significantly between 1974 and 2010 (1974 - 1983, r(2) = 0. 98, n = 74 674; 1984 - 1993, r(2) = 0. 95, n = 96 696; 1994 - 2003, r(2) = 0. 93, n = 12 619; 2004 - 2010, r(2) = 0. 91, n = 12 887), whereas the length range remained the same (10 - 110 cm TL). Biological indicators clearly showed that E. aeneus stocks in Senegal are overexploited and the species is now endangered. Immediate active management of fishing pressure is needed, therefore, to maintain E. aeneus populations in the area. Our results suggest a minimum size of < 50 cm should be introduced and that fishing effort should be reduced...|$|E
