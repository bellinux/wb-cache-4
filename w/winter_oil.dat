Genotype and environment effects on seed quality traits (sensorial, nutritional and physical) were studied in chickpea dry grain. Twenty genotypes were grown in winter and spring sowings over two campaigns in four different locations in southern Spain. Significant differences were observed in oil, acid detergent fiber (ADF) and protein content between sowing times (S). In <b>winter,</b> <b>oil</b> and ADF content were higher, while protein content was lower. Although, in general, highly significant variation was detected for genotype (G), environment (E) and single interactions (GE, GS and ES), the genotype effect was stronger for ADF, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), oil, starch and protein content, and for physical and sensory traits (r 2 > 27 %). In contrast, environment {{played an important role}} in variation in the content of amylose and amylopectin (r 2 = 71. 7 %). No high relationships were found between the sensory and nutritional or physical characteristics studied. In general, our results suggest a high genetic gain for seed quality in nutritional, physical and sensory traits in chickpea. Genotypes with good seed sensory quality should be selected in the final stages of the breeding program, because it is not feasible to evaluate very large numbers of samples. However, in some cases, moderate correlations were found between sensory and either nutritional or physical traits. Therefore, indirect selection to increase the frequency of genes for sensory traits in an early stage should be considered.

We evaluated the response of different apple cultivars (Golden Delicious, Gala, Fuji, Granny Smith and Jonagold) grown on M 9 rootstock with different dormancy-management practices. The trials were carried out between 2004 and 2006 in a tropical mountain area (Tigray, Ethiopia), where chilling conditions are poor with the aim of improving and synchronizing the bud break and the blossoming period of these apple cultivars. Two-year-old well-feathered trees were planted in two experimental trial sites in it randomized complete block design. Trees were subjected to the following treatments in two sets of experiments: one defoliation per year only; two defoliations per year, one defoliation followed by 1 % hydrogen cyanamide (Dormex) treatment; one defoliation followed by 2 % Dormex treatment; one defoliation followed by 40 % winter oil; one defoliation followed by 0. 5 % Dormex and 2 % winter oil; and a control with no defoliation or dormancy breaking treatments. The result show positive effects of the dormancy breaking agents oil the productivity of the trees after defoliation, with comparable results for the effectiveness of both Dormex and <b>winter</b> <b>oil.</b> There were On statistically significant differences between the Dormex closes. The defoliation treatment alone Was not sufficient to break dormancy for the cultivars Golden Delicious, Granny Smith or Gala but showed promising results with dormancy breaking Jonagold.

40|$|Fruit {{quality is}} the result of a complex {{interaction}} of management and environmental factors. By understanding the impact of environment, culture, harvesting, handling and storage on fruit quality, growers should be able to improve both average qualities in their crop as well as improving the proportion of fruit in the highest quality grade. Whilst management practices such as pruning, training, and crop regulation methods contributed widely for development of quality fruit. The relationships between apple rootstock-scion are important and provide a basis for selecting the best graft combination for particular environmental conditions and high fruit quality. Because these interaction influences chilling requirements for bud-break, water relations, nutrient uptake, plant size, blossoming, time for fruit set, fruit quality and yield efficiency. Also, both the degree and timing of pruning can affect crop load, fruit size, and fruit quality. Pruning during the dormant winter period resulted in better fruit quality than when pruning was delayed until after fruit set. Early thinning had a positive effect on fruit quality, resulting in larger, firmer fruit with higher sugar levels. However, all these parameters are directly or indirectly affected by the environment. Responses of apple fruit to different environmental conditions (temperature, rainfall, relative humidity of the atmosphere and various soil types) was given prior consideration before starting fruit culture in some location. Even though growing conditions (environmental and cultural factors) influence cultivar performance, this can be well compensated by different cultural practices required for appropriate orchard management such as tree training and pruning, use of artificial dormancy breaking chemicals (Dormex, <b>Winter</b> <b>oil</b> and others) to promote flowering and fruit setting as well as for better yield of cultivars by overcoming the influence of fluctuating temperature that would result in incomplete or partial chilling. Cultivar introduction must be based on its temperature requirements (i. e. low, medium or high) for successful orchard establishment. In most of the tropical highland conditions where apple is growing, introducing low-chill cultivar is recommended for quality fruit production because these cultivars are easily satisfied by the existing low temperature and able to tolerate temperature fluctuation in most of the highland areas. Alternatively, medium chill-requiring cultivars were supposed to grow when supported by hand defoliation followed by dormancy breaking agents better yield with good fruit quality. This review mainly focuses on increasing awareness of the impact of environmental influence on apple fruit tree physiology and how to find out solutions for effective orchard management practices in Ethiopia/tropical highlands for quality and sustainable fruit production.

Attempts to change the constructions and materials of the weeding tools have not decisively improved the selectivity and more intelligent methods capable of controlling only the weeds are therefore needed. The first step in that direction was the introduction of electronic steering systems for automatic guidance of inter-row hoes. They are based on image analysis of the crop row, and the technology {{is considered to be a}} kind of platform for the development of more advanced systems for robotic weeding in the rows of row crops, such as sugar beets, maize, and most vegetables. However, recent studies have shown that such an ambition may be difficult to fulfil because weed plants growing right beside the crop plants are the most harmful ones in terms of suppressing the crop plants. Whether any computer-based system would be able to guide a cutting device with sufficient accuracy and speed to remove those weeds in a practical situation in row crops seems questionable. Hence, other projects have been started with a view to avoid this challenge, trying to look for less complicated methods with more short-termed prospects of being applicable in practice. Steaming the soil prior to crop establishment and in bands corresponding to crop rows appears to have some potential in that context since an almost complete intra-row weed control can be achieved without affecting the crop.

40|$|Summary Seed is {{the basic}} and most {{critical}} input for seed propagated agricultural crops: seed quality and seedling vigour determine plant establishment, growth and development in both natural and agricultural ecosystems. Seed quality and seedling vigour are mainly determined by the interactions of the following three components: genetic background, physiological quality and the environmental conditions during seed set, seed ripening, storage, seed germination and early seedling development. In the past, many efforts {{have been made to}} improve seed germination and seedling vigour by optimizing physiological and environmental factors (non-genetic factors); however, the paradigm has shifted to investigate genetic factors and to use these to improve crop performance by plant breeding. The aim of this thesis is to unravel the genetics of seed germination and seedling vigour under different conditions in Brassica rapa, using a systems genetics approach. Studies in many crop species have reported that seed germination and seedling vigour traits are governed by many genes and are strongly affected by environmental conditions. As salinity stress is becoming {{one of the most important}} abiotic stresses affecting crop growth and yield, we studied the genetics of seed germination and seedling vigour under neutral and salt stress conditions. For a number of crops, it has been established that larger seed size and higher seed weight indicate more reserve food and contribute positively to seedling establishment. Therefore, our hypothesis for this thesis is that transcriptional regulation of genes during seed development determines the composition and content of seed reserves, and that these seed reserves play a major role in seed germination and seedling growth, especially at the heterotrophic stage under optimal and sub-optimal conditions.  B. rapa is an extremely diverse Brassica species which includes, besides many diverse leafy vegetable types and turnips, also oilseed crops. Brassica seeds are of high economic importance for several reasons. They are the starting point of the life cycle of the crop, but also they are directly used as sources of vegetable oil or condiments. At present, B. napus is the most important source of vegetable oil worldwide, but B. rapa is often used for introgression breeding to broaden its narrow genetic base resulting in genetic improvements. Therefore, the acquired knowledge is also useful for the scientific community and plant breeders working in B. napus and other Brassica species. In Chapter 2 we evaluated the genetic diversity of a B. rapa core collection of 168 accessions representing different crop types and geographic origins. Using the Bayesian cluster analysis software STRUCTURE, we identified four subpopulations: subpopulation 1 with accessions of Indian origin, spring oil, yellow sarson and rapid cycling; subpopulation 2 consisting of several types from Asian origins: pak choi, <b>winter</b> <b>oil,</b> mizuna, mibuna, komasuna, turnip green, oil rape and Asian turnip; subpopulation 3, which included mainly accessions of Chinese cabbage and subpopulation 4 with mostly vegetable turnip, fodder turnip and brocoletto accessions from European origin. The geographical distribution of the accessions was very much congruent with genetic, metabolic and morphological diversity. This initial study was followed by association studies for secondary metabolites from the tocopherol and carotenoids pathways, using the population structure of these four subpopulations as a correction term to control for spurious marker-trait associations (Chapter 2). Additionally, we used a machine learning approach, Random Forest (RF) regression, to find marker-trait associations. We chose the RF approach as it can handle large numbers of variables (markers, metabolites, transcript abundance) in combination with relatively small sample sets of accessions, to show its perspectives for application to the increasing amounts of data available through the different ~omics technologies. In our analysis, the markers showing significant association with metabolites identified by the RF approach overlapped with markers obtained from association mapping. Those markers could potentially be used for marker-assisted selection (MAS) in breeding for these secondary metabolites in different morphotypes or sub-populations. Knowledge of genetic distance as evaluated in this chapter allowed the choice of parents to create a segregating population for QTL analyses by maximizing genetic variation between the parents. In Chapter 4, a doubled haploid (DH) population from a cross of genetically diverse morphotypes of B. rapa, an oil-type yellow sarson (YS 143) and a vegetable pak choi (PC 175) (Chapter 2), was used to evaluate the genetic basis of seed germination and seedling vigour traits under both non-stress and salt stress conditions. The yellow sarson parent had larger seed size and higher thousand-seed weight than the pak choi parent, and displayed earlier onset, higher uniformity in germination, faster germination and maximum germination, and higher root- and shoot- lengths and biomass under both non-stress and salt stress conditions. Positive correlations of thousand-seed weight with earliness, speed and uniformity of germination and maximum germination percentage, supports that larger seeds germinate earlier, faster, more uniformly and to a higher maximum germination percentage than smaller seeds. Thus, we conclude that yellow sarson had higher seed quality and seedling vigour than pak choi. However yellow sarson also contributed negative alleles to seed germination, as illustrated by its allele of the QTL at A 05 which decreases the uniformity of seed germination. In addition we also observed that yellow sarson seedling growth was more affected by salt stress than pak choi. All traits were scored over the DH population, and this clearly showed transgressive variation for most traits. Eight QTL hotspots were identified for seed weight, seed germination, and root and shoot lengths. A QTL hotspot for seed germination on A 02 co-located with a homologue of the FLOWERING LOCUS C (BrFLC 2) genes and its cis-acting expression QTL (cis-eQTL). FLC 2 (BrFLC 2 in B. rapa) is an important repressor of flowering time in both A. thaliana and B. rapa and recently, FLC 2 was reported for its pleiotropic effect on seed germination in A. thaliana. A QTL hotspot on A 05 with salt stress specific QTL co-located with the FATTY ACID DESATURASE 2 (BrFAD 2) gene and its cis-eQTL. Besides the role of FAD 2 in fatty acid desaturation, the up-regulation of this gene was associated with enhanced seed germination and hypocotyl elongation under salinity in B. napus (BnFAD 2) and A. thaliana (FAD 2). We observed epistatic interactions between the QTL hotspots at the BrFLC 2 and BrFAD 2 loci, and between other QTL hotspots. Seed development is regulated by many dynamic metabolic processes controlled by complex networks of spatially and temporally expressed genes. Therefore, morphological characteristics and the transcriptional signatures of developing seeds from yellow- and brown/black-seeded genotypes were studied to get to know the timing of key metabolic processes, to explore the major transcriptional differences and to identify the optimum stage for a genetical genomics study for B. rapa seed traits (Chapter 3). This is the first study of genome-wide profiling of transcript abundance during seed development in B. rapa. Most transcriptional changes occurred between 25 and 35 days after pollination (between the bent-cotyledon stage and the stage when the embryo fully fills the seed), which is later than in the related species B. napus. A weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) identified 47 gene modules with different co-expression patterns, of which 17 showed a genotype effect, 4 modules a time effect during seed development and 6 modules both genotype and time effects. Based on the number of genes in gene modules, the predominant variation in gene expression was according to developmental stages rather than morphotype differences. We identified 17 putative cis-regulatory elements (motifs) for four co-regulated gene clusters of genes related to lipid metabolism. The identification of key physiological events, major expression patterns, and putative cis-regulatory elements provides useful information to construct gene regulatory networks in B. rapa developing seeds and provides a starting point for a genetical genomics study of fatty acid composition and additional seed traits in Chapter 5. Since Brassica seeds are sources of vegetable oil, genetic studies of the gene regulatory mechanisms underlying lipid metabolism is of high importance, not only in relation to seed and seedling vigour, but also for Brassica oilseed breeding. In Chapter 5, an integrative approach of QTL mapping for fatty acids composition and for transcript abundance (eQTL) of genes related to lipid metabolism, together with gene co-expression networks was used to unravel the genetic regulation of seed fatty acid composition in the DH population of B. rapa. In this study, a confounding effect of flowering time variation was observed on fatty acid QTLs (metabolite level) at linkage group A 02 and of seed colour variation on eQTLs (transcript level) at linkage group A 09. At A 02, fatty acid QTLs from 2009 seeds co-locate with the genetic position of a gene-targeted marker for BrFLC 2, its cis-QTL, and a major flowering time QTL. Flowering time variation is very obvious in this DH population and the BrFLC 2 gene at A 02 (16. 7 cM) is the major regulator of flowering time, with a non-functional allele in the yellow sarson parent. When QTL analysis was performed on seeds from 2011, from DH lines that flowered synchronously due to staggered sowing, this fatty acid QTL hotspot disappeared. The 2011 seed lot was used for further analysis combining fatty acid QTLs with eQTLs in this study. On A 09, a large trans-eQTL hotspot was co-localized with a major seed colour QTL, in the region where the causal gene, the bHLH transcription factor BrTT 8, was cloned. The role of this gene in seed colour development was functionally proven in B. rapa. As the yellow sarson and pak choi parents of this population have contrasting seed coat colour (Chapter 3) the DH lines segregated for seed colour. When seed colour variation was used as a co-variate in our statistical model, we could exclude its confounding effect on eQTL mapping. We compared the fatty acid QTL and eQTL results from the analyses before and after seed colour correction and later discuss the results from the analysis after correction. The distribution of major QTLs for fatty acids showed a relationship with the types of fatty acids: linkage group A 03 contained major QTLs for monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), A 04 for saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and A 05 for polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Using a genetical genomics approach, eQTL hotspots were found at major fatty acid QTLs on A 03, A 04 and A 05 and on A 09. Finally, an eQTL-guided gene co-expression network of lipid metabolism related genes showed major hubs at the genes BrPLA 2 -ALPHA, BrWD- 40, a number of seed storage protein genes and a transcription factor BrMD- 2, suggesting essential roles of these genes in lipid metabolism. Several genes, such as BrFAE 1, BrTAG 1, BrFAD 2, BrFAD 5, BrFAD 7, which were reported as important genes for fatty acid composition in seeds in other studies of related species, had relatively lower degrees of connection in the networks. However their cis-eQTLs co-localized with specific fatty acid QTLs, making them candidate genes for the observed variation. We hypothesize that these play a role in modifying fatty acid content or composition across genotypes, rather than playing essential roles in the pathway itself. These results suggest the need of a global study of lipid metabolism rather than a strict focus on the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway per se. This study gives a starting point for understanding the genetic regulation of lipid metabolism, by identification of a number of key regulatory genes, identified as major hub genes, and candidate genes for fatty acid QTLs. In the final chapter (Chapter 6) we summarize and critically discuss the relationships among phenotypic traits, metabolites and expression variation as well as the co-localization of QTLs from these different levels. In this thesis, we developed methodology to integrate transcriptomics and metabolomics data sets and to construct gene regulatory networks related to major fatty acids, and found a set of (possible) candidate genes involved in lipid metabolism. In the future, we recommend to integrate the genome-wide transcriptome data set with all major seed metabolites and phenotypic data on seed and seedling vigour to directly link all three components: transcriptome, metabolome and phenotypic traits, and ultimately expand the knowledge on the genetic regulation of seed metabolites, seed quality and seedling vigour in B. rapa to other Brassica species...|$|E
5000|$|When winter biking, some cyclists {{regularly}} lubricate {{the chain}} {{with a wet}} lubricant. An Ottawa winter biking website states that lubricant [...] "...may have to be reapplied daily in slush conditions", due {{to the presence of}} water and road salt on streets. The OBLP states that winter cyclists use a [...] "thickish lube" [...] on their chain and derailleurs. An Ottawa bike website states that there is a downside to using oil lubricants: [...] "oil lubes are a quick and dirty way to keep your bicycle running in <b>winter,</b> because <b>oil</b> doesn’t freeze and it does displace water - thus preventing freezing. However, oil collects a lot of dirt and debris - wearing your bicycle’s components faster." [...] The city of Toronto states that some <b>winter</b> cyclists <b>oil</b> the freewheel and put [...] "...a drop of oil {{at the end of each}} wheel spoke" [...] to reduce rusting. A Torontoist article states that winter cyclists [...] "wipe down their bike riding, paying special attention to the brakes, which can corrode easily. And then clean and lubricate the chain" [...] with a wet, oil-based lubricant. The OBLP states that some winter cyclists wash off their bike, to get grime and salt off the components. Some car washes and indoor parking garages have high-pressure hoses that can be used.|$|R
40|$|In two field trials, {{the use of}} treated {{domestic}} sewage effluent or ground water for growing three <b>oil</b> <b>winter</b> crops (rape, <b>oil</b> lettuce and flax) and two cereal winter crops (wheat and barley) were explored. The pertinence of reusing biologically treated {{domestic sewage}} effluent in farming practices were assessed {{in terms of both}} parasitic load and potential toxic elements inside. Results exhibited that all tested growth characters and yield components for plants irrigated with biologically treated sewage effluent far exceeded those for plants irrigated with ground water. The content of potential toxic elements in oil, seeds, grains grown in plots irrigated with exclusive treated domestic sewage effluent were almost {{more or less the same}} as those met in harvests irrigated with ground water. Enteric pathogens were ascertained in harvests irrigated with sole treated domestic sewage effluent...|$|R
40|$|A Brassica rapa {{collection}} of 239 accessions, {{based on two}} core collections representing different morphotypes from different geographical origins, is presented and its use for association mapping is illustrated for flowering time. We analyzed phenotypic variation of leaf and seed pod traits, plant architecture, and flowering time using data collected from three field experiments and evaluated the genetic diversity {{with a set of}} SSR markers. The Wageningen University and Research Centre (WUR) and the Vavilov Research Institute of Plant Industry (VIR) core collections had similar representations of most morphotypes, as illustrated by the phenotypic and genetic variation within these groups. The analysis of population structure revealed five subgroups in the collection, whereas previous studies of the WUR core collection indicated four subgroups; the fifth group identified consisted mainly of oil accessions from the VIR core collection, <b>winter</b> <b>oils</b> from Pakistan, {{and a number of other}} types. A very small group of summer oils is described, that is not related to other oil accessions. A candidate gene approach was chosen for association mapping of flowering time with a BrFLC 1 biallelic CAPS marker and a BrFLC 2 multiallelic SSR marker. The two markers were significantly associated with flowering time, but their effects were confined to certain morphotypes and (or) alleles. Based on these results, we discuss the optimal design for an association mapping population and the need to fix the heterogeneous accessions to facilitate phenotyping and genotyping...|$|R
50|$|For single <b>winter</b> grade <b>oils,</b> {{the dynamic}} {{viscosity}} is measured at different cold temperatures, specified in J300 {{depending on the}} viscosity grade, in units of mPa·s, or the equivalent older non-SI units, centipoise (abbreviated cP), using two different test methods. They are the Cold Cranking Simulator (ASTMD5293) and the Mini-Rotary Viscometer (ASTM D4684). Based on the coldest temperature the oil passes at, that oil is graded as SAE viscosity grade 0W, 5W, 10W, 15W, 20W, or 25W. The lower the viscosity grade, the lower the temperature the oil can pass. For example, if an oil passes at the specifications for 10W and 5W, but fails for 0W, then that oil must be labeled as an SAE 5W. That oil cannot be labeled as either 0W or 10W.|$|R
50|$|The {{sole member}} of the TRPA sub-family, TRPA1, {{contains}} 14 N-terminal ankyrin repeats and is believed {{to function as a}} mechanical stress sensor. It is expressed in the dorsal root ganglion, trigeminal ganglion, and hair cells. The temperature sensitivity of TRPA1 is highly disputed, with some reports claiming that it is activated by noxiously cold stimuli and others disputing such a claim. TRPA1 is known to be activated by compounds capable of forming covalent chemical bonds with the protein's cysteins like isothiocyanates, which are the pungent chemicals in substances such as mustard oil and wasabi and Michael acceptors such as cinnamaldehyde in cinnamon, amongst numerous other substances. Non-covalent activators of TRPA1 also exists, such as methyl salicylate in <b>winter</b> green <b>oil</b> and the synthetic compound PF-4840154.|$|R
50|$|Since the {{encyclopedia}} article {{was published in}} 1911, there have been significant changes. Few Irish cattle now come in, the area is still famed for cattle, more commonly continental breeds,with most slaughtered in Scotland, and in particular a good local abattoir capacity. Spring Barley is the predominant crop, and in lowland <b>Winter</b> Wheat, <b>Oil</b> Seed Rape & Potatoes would be more common than oats. There is also a significant area of carrots grown. With no slaughter capacity in Scotland the pig industry is diminishing but still {{a very important part}} of the North East economy. Farm sizes are perhaps still relatively smaller than UK but there are some significant agribusinesses in Aberdeenshire. Few farmers raise horses, though horses are more common, kept by private owners & specialists, than in any other area of Scotland.|$|R

40|$|Summary. The paper {{discusses}} {{an influence}} of hydrocarbon fuels and biofuels properties on self-ignition delay period in AD 3. 152 UR engine. The period significantly affects the combustion speed, {{the rate of}} pressure and temperature increase, easy engine starting and other engine per-formance characteristics. It also influences the emission values of basic toxic components such as CO, HC, NOx, PM in exhaust gases. The values of self-ignition delay period were determined when the engine was fuelled by EKODIESEL PLUS 50 hydrocarbon fuel (environmentally friendly <b>winter</b> diesel <b>oil)</b> and FAME (Fatty Acid Methyl Esters) plant fuel, made of plant or animal oils fatty acids methyl esters. Investigations into the engine were conducted in an engine test house equipped with a system for measuring pressures and other fast changing values. In investigations the engine was operated under load conditions at the maximum torque speed n = 1400 rpm and rated power speed n = 2000 rpm. The analysis of results was {{made on the basis}} of averaged pressures in indicator diagrams taken on 100 engine work cycles...|$|R
