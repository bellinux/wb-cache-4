25|$|Carmen Jones was a CinemaScope {{motion picture}} {{that had begun}} {{shooting}} within the first 12 months of Twentieth Century Fox's venture in 1953 to CinemaScope Technicolor as its main production mode. The historical costume drama, the western and the war film had filled Fox's production schedule and this all-black musical drama based on an established and popular opera <b>would</b> <b>surely</b> <b>be</b> a box-office success, as proved true. Carmen Jones was released in October 1954, exactly one year and one month after Fox's first CinemaScope venture, the Biblical epic The Robe, had opened in theatres.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the war, Featherston drifts for a short while, before joining the newly created Freedom Party. Featherston establishes himself as head propagandist, and eventually becomes its leader, aided by Party member Ferdinand Koenig. With his raw energy and humble origins, Featherston has little trouble whipping up support from much of the Confederate populace, and it seems by the early 1920s that he <b>would</b> <b>surely</b> <b>be</b> leading the country. But with the assassination of President Wade Hampton V in June 1922 by a Party stalwart, the Freedom Party suffers a sudden and near-total collapse as a political force.|$|E

500|$|Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun called [...] "Party" [...] {{the most}} {{throwaway}} moment on 4. Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "the promisingly named 'Party' [...] {{turns out to}} be a slow-jam invitation to an after-work mixer with light refreshments." [...] Chicago Sun-Timess Thomas Conner complimented the harmonies [...] "scooping, gliding multi-tracked harmonies that almost make moot the idea of a Destiny's reunion." [...] Gil Kaufman of MTV News was also positive, writing that [...] " [...] unlike the at-points frantic 'Run the World (Girls)' [...] takes its time, lyrically and musically, with Beyoncé luxuriating over her vocals and singing about the beauty of nice and slow." [...] Describing [...] "Party" [...] as [...] "a proudly retro slice of R", James Reed of The Boston Globe wrote that the song is [...] "an irresistible summer jam that I haven't been able to stop humming for a week straight."

500|$|Nosanchuk {{gave his}} final {{statement}} to the court first. Speaking for the defence, he reminded the jury {{that every one of}} the doctors speaking on Lamb's behalf had originally been engaged by the state and that Yaworsky was the only one not employed in the public sector. He conceded that the defendant's actions were senseless and violent, but stressed that if found {{not guilty by reason of}} insanity, Lamb would stay in custody and could be kept in psychiatric care for the rest of his life if necessary. He argued that Lamb's actions on the evening of 25 June 1966 clearly made no sense and asked the jury to carefully consider them: the victims were not known to Lamb; Lamb made no attempt to disguise himself; Lamb acted alone; Lamb had nothing to gain from the act; Lamb inexplicably diverted his fire from the original group to a shadow in a doorway; Lamb then chose another house at random and threatened to kill the occupant, then left without doing anything; Lamb made no attempt to hide the weapon, leaving it in a nearby field where it <b>would</b> <b>surely</b> <b>be</b> found; then, finally, the boy simply went home to bed as if nothing had happened. Was this, Nosanchuk asked, the behaviour of a premeditated killer, or of a profoundly disturbed young man who did not appreciate what he was doing? ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{question}} is not whether the response to the subpoena may be introduced into evidence at his criminal trial.

2500|$|The van was {{commonly}} {{said to be}} all-black, but {{the section}} above the red stripe was metallic gray. The angle of the rear spoiler {{can also be seen}} to vary on different examples of the van within the series. Additionally, some versions of the van have a sunroof, whereas others, typically those used for stunts (and including the one displayed in the aforementioned Cars of the Stars Motor Museum) do not. This led to continuity errors in some episodes, such as in the third season's [...] "The Bells of St. Mary's", in a scene where Face (his double) jumps from a building onto the roof of the van with no sunroof. Moments later, in an interior studio shot, Face climbs in through the sunroof. Also, in many stunts where the van <b>would</b> <b>surely</b> <b>be</b> totaled, other makes have been used, such as a black Ford Econoline with red hubcaps painted to simulate the original red turbine mag wheels.|$|E

God, however, replied (in the words of [...] ) that [...] "Whoever keeps the fig-tree shall eat its fruit; and whoever waits on the master shall be honored." [...] The sons of Moses sat idly by and did not study Torah, but Joshua served Moses and showed him great honor, rose {{early in the morning}} and remained late at night at the House of Assembly, and arranged the benches and spread the mats. As he had served Moses with all his might, he was worthy to serve Israel, and thus God in [...] directed Moses to [...] "take Joshua the son of Nun" [...] as his successor.|$|E
2500|$|Lloyd's {{career was}} not all laughs, however. [...] In August 1919, while posing for some promotional still {{photographs}} in the Los Angeles Witzel Photography Studio, he was seriously injured holding a prop bomb thought merely to be a smoke pot. It exploded and mangled his hand, causing him to lose a thumb and forefinger. [...] The blast was severe enough that the cameraman and prop director nearby were also seriously injured. Lloyd was {{in the act of}} lighting a cigarette from the fuse of the bomb when it exploded, also badly burning his face and chest and injuring his eye. [...] Despite the proximity of the blast to his face, he retained his sight. As he recalled in 1930, [...] "I thought I <b>would</b> <b>surely</b> <b>be</b> so disabled that I {{would never be able to}} work again. I didn't suppose that I would have one five-hundredth of what I have now. Still I thought, 'Life is worth while. Just to be alive. I still think so." ...|$|E

2500|$|Though demonstrations {{against the}} Iraq war and {{subsequent}} occupation have continued none has matched {{this day in}} terms of size. One explanation for this that has been suggested is that people have become disillusioned with marching as a political tactic because {{of the failure of}} these demonstrations to achieve their explicit aim. In 2006 three years after this day, in an article arguing for people to attend a further march, Mike Marqusee put forward two counter arguments to this. Firstly he claimed that it was too soon to judge the long-term significance of the demonstrations noting that [...] "People {{who took part in the}} non-cooperation campaigns in India in the 20s and 30s had to wait a long time for independence." [...] and that [...] "There were eight years of protest and more than 2 million dead before the Vietnam war came to an end". Secondly, he claimed that while the effect of marching may be uncertain, the effect of not marching <b>would</b> <b>surely</b> <b>be</b> to make it more likely that the occupation would continue.|$|E
2500|$|At Mytilene, however, {{time was}} rapidly running {{out for the}} Peloponnesians {{to come to the}} rescue. [...] A Spartan representative, Salaethus, had been smuggled into the city in a trireme {{at the end of the}} winter with news of the relief scheme, and had taken command of the {{defenses}} there in anticipation of the fleet's arrival. [...] Food supplies in the city, however, were exhausted at some point early in the summer, and, since the fleet had yet to materialize, Salaethus was forced to gamble on a breakout attempt. [...] Hoplite armor was issued to all the citizens, most of whom heretofore had only served as light troops, in preparation for this attempt. Once the people were thus armed, however, they refused to obey the government and demanded that the authorities distribute any remaining food supplies, threatening to come to terms with the Athenians on their own if this was not done. [...] Realizing that they could not prevent this, and that a peace concluded without their involvement <b>would</b> <b>surely</b> <b>be</b> fatal to them, the members of the government contacted the Athenian commander and surrendered, on the condition that none of the Mytileneans should be imprisoned, enslaved, or executed until representatives from the city had presented their case at Athens.|$|E
2500|$|In {{one case}} he sent Xu Fu, a Zhifu islander, with ships {{carrying}} hundreds {{of young men}} and women in search of the mystical Penglai mountain. They were sent to find Anqi Sheng, a 1,000-year-old magician whom Qin Shi Huang had supposedly met in his travels and who had invited him to seek him there. These people never returned, perhaps because they knew that if they returned without the promised elixir, they <b>would</b> <b>surely</b> <b>be</b> executed. Legends claim that they reached Japan and colonized it. It is also possible that the book burning, a purge on what could be seen as wasteful and useless literature, was, in part, an attempt to focus the minds of the Emperor's best scholars on the alchemical quest. Some of the executed scholars were those who had been unable to offer any evidence of their supernatural schemes. This may have been the ultimate means of testing their abilities: if any of them had magic powers, then they would surely come back to life when they were let out again. Since the great emperor was afraid of death and [...] "evil spirits", he had workers build a series of tunnels and passageways to each of his palaces (he owned over 200), because traveling unseen would supposedly keep him safe from the evil spirits. Qin Shi Huang was said to have died by drinking mercury, believing it to be an elixir of immortality.|$|E
