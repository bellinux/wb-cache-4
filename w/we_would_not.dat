5|$|It has {{not been}} said of any people on the earth that the moon was {{observed}} that night such {{that it could be}} stated that it was not split. Even if this had been reported from many different places, so that one would have to exclude the possibility that all agreed upon a lie, yet, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> accept this as proof to the contrary, for the moon is not seen in the same way by different people... An eclipse is visible in one country but not in the other one; in one place it is total, in the other one only partial.|$|E

2500|$|Producer Eric Manes explained, [...] "Without Iraqis as the directors, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> {{have seen}} Iraq {{and its people}} only through the filter of Western eyes. <b>We</b> {{certainly}} <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have had the access or the emotional intimacy that was captured in the film." ...|$|R

25|$|Were {{it not for}} his unremitting labors, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> {{think of}} Gibbon as having written a great autobiography; rather, we would {{think of him as}} a {{historian}} who tried to write an autobiography but failed.|$|E
25|$|Centrality indices {{have two}} {{important}} limitations, one obvious {{and the other}} subtle. The obvious limitation is that a centrality which is optimal for one application is often sub-optimal for a different application. Indeed, if this were not so, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> need so many different centralities.|$|E
25|$|The Meissner {{effect is}} {{distinct}} from this—it is the spontaneous expulsion which occurs during transition to superconductivity. Suppose we have a material in its normal state, containing a constant internal magnetic field. When the material is cooled below the critical temperature, we would observe the abrupt expulsion of the internal magnetic field, which <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> expect based on Lenz's law.|$|E
6000|$|As {{they were}} going into the house together, Leo said: [...] "I think <b>we</b> <b>would</b> better <b>not</b> let our elders read this book of Morselli's. It's too {{disturbing}} for them--don't you think so?" ...|$|R

25|$|The erasures were {{sporadic}} and haphazard, {{with only}} the more visible and accessible images of Hatshepsut being removed; had it been more complete, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> now have so many images of Hatshepsut. Thutmose III may have died before these changes were finished {{and it may be}} that he never intended a total obliteration of her memory. In fact, we have no evidence to support the assumption that Thutmose hated or resented Hatshepsut during her lifetime. Had that been true, as head of the army, in a position given to him by Hatshepsut (who was clearly not worried about her co-regent's loyalty), he surely could have led a successful coup, but he made no attempt to challenge her authority during her reign and, her accomplishments and images remained featured on all of the public buildings she built for twenty years after her death.|$|E
25|$|Of the 27 {{books in}} the New Testament, 14 have been {{attributed}} to Paul; 7 of these are widely considered authentic and Paul's own, while the authorship of the other 7 is disputed. The undisputed letters are considered the most important sources since they contain what everyone agrees to be Paul's own statements about his life and thoughts. Theologian Mark Powell writes that Paul directed these 7 letters to specific occasions at particular churches. As an example, if the Corinthian church had not experienced problems concerning its celebration of the Lord's Supper, today <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> know that Paul even believed in that observance or had any opinions about it one way or the other. He asks if we might be ignorant of other matters simply because no crises arose that prompted Paul to comment on them.|$|E
25|$|To see why exotic {{matter is}} required, {{consider}} an incoming light front traveling along geodesics, which then crosses the wormhole and re-expands {{on the other}} side. The expansion goes from negative to positive. As the wormhole neck is of finite size, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> expect caustics to develop, at least within {{the vicinity of the}} neck. According to the optical Raychaudhuri's theorem, this requires a violation of the averaged null energy condition. Quantum effects such as the Casimir effect cannot violate the averaged null energy condition in any neighborhood of space with zero curvature, but calculations in semiclassical gravity suggest that quantum effects may be able to violate this condition in curved spacetime. Although it was hoped recently that quantum effects could not violate an achronal version of the averaged null energy condition, violations have nevertheless been found, so it remains an open possibility that quantum effects might be used to support a wormhole.|$|E

60|$|We were silent, and, {{upon the}} {{reflection}} to which our silence invited us, {{we found that}} <b>we</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>not</b> ourselves think of the image we had invoked. We preferred {{to take up the}} question at another point.|$|R
50|$|After {{attending}} Orthros and Divine Liturgy at age 15 {{he later}} recalled: We knew {{from that moment}} that <b>we</b> <b>would</b> probably <b>not</b> go anywhere else...It was so evident that something really took place...the Holy Spirit transforming the bread and wine.|$|R
25|$|The {{fact that}} the {{chromatic}} number of the plane {{must be at least}} four follows from the existence of a seven-vertex unit distance graph with chromatic number four, named the Moser spindle after its discovery in 1961 by the brothers William and Leo Moser. This graph consists of two unit equilateral triangles joined at a common vertexx. Each of these triangles is joined along another edge to another equilateral triangle; the vertices y and z of these joined triangles are at unit distance from each other. If the plane could be three-colored, the coloring within the triangles would force y and z to both have the same color as x, but then, since y and z are at unit distance from each other, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have a proper coloring of the unit distance graph of the plane. Therefore, at least four colors are needed to color this graph and the plane containing it. An alternative lower bound {{in the form of a}} ten-vertex four-chromatic unit distance graph was discovered at around the same time by Solomon W. Golomb.|$|E
25|$|As the war progressed, with no hope {{of joining}} the {{rebellion}} due to power of the Royal Navy (in the letter he had addressed to Bermudians soliciting the theft of the gunpowder, George Washington had written <b>We</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> wish to in volve you in an Opposition, in which from your Situation, we should be unable to support you: – We knew not therefore to what Extent to sollicit your Assistance in availing ourselves of this Supply), with increasing numbers of American loyalists in Bermuda (such as the privateer Bridger Goodrich), and with their economic opportunities dwindling, Bermudians overcame their sympathies for their erstwhile countrymen and unleashed their privateers (which, {{by the middle of}} the 18th century already outnumbered those of any of the mainland colonies) upon American shipping. The Bermudian effectiveness was such that, when the US sued British privateers for wrongful seizures in British courts, following the war, a sizable part of the damages they were awarded were to have come from Bermudians, like Hezekiah Frith (although, with the local authorities tasked with collecting these damages being in sympathy with the defendants, most of these damages were never paid).|$|E
500|$|The {{series was}} {{successfully}} nominated in 2009, {{but failed to}} merit an award. Mark Hentemann, executive producer and showrunner of Family Guy said of the nominating process, [...] "We had internal discussions in the writers' room, {{and it seemed like}} we were much more akin to the other primetime comedies than we were to children's shows in animation. We assumed <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> get anywhere, and so it was a great surprise when we got the nomination." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{the atomic}} bombing of Hiroshima, on August 6, 1945, Agnew, along with Alvarez and Johnston, flew as a {{scientific}} observer in The Great Artiste, piloted by Charles Sweeney, which tailed the Enola Gay as the instrumentation aircraft. [...] Agnew later recalled, [...] "After we dropped our gauges I remember we made a sharp turn to the right so that <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> {{get caught in the}} blast – but we still got badly shaken up by it." [...] He brought along a movie camera and took the only existing movies of the Hiroshima event as seen from the air.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the 2003 {{invasion}} of Iraq, Moran told an anti-war audience in Reston, Virginia, that if [...] "it {{were not for}} the strong support of the Jewish community for this war with Iraq, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be doing this. The leaders of the Jewish community are influential enough that they could change the direction of where this is going, and I think they should". This brought criticism from many of his own party, including, among others, Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle and Senator Joe Lieberman. Nancy Pelosi, who was House Minority Leader at the time, remarked that [...] "Moran's comments have no place in the Democratic Party." ...|$|E
500|$|Overall, Walker concludes, [...] "Posterity {{may have}} {{overestimated}} {{the importance of}} extra-musical thought in Liszt's symphonic poems. <b>We</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> want to be without his prefaces, of course, nor any other that he made {{about the origins of}} his music; but we should not follow them slavishly, {{for the simple reason that}} the symphonic poems do not follow them slavishly either." [...] Hugh MacDonald concurs that Liszt [...] "held an idealized view of the symphonic poem" [...] as being evocative rather than representational. [...] "He only rarely achieved in his symphonic poems the directness and subtle timing that narrative requires," [...] MacDonald explains; he generally focused more on expressing poetic ideas by setting a mood or atmosphere, refraining on the whole from narrative description or pictorial realism.|$|E
6000|$|Having thus {{disposed}} of our superfluous gear we arranged the kit we five--Sir Henry, Good, myself, Umbopa, and the Hottentot Ventvögel--were {{to take with}} us on our journey.

500|$|The {{episode was}} among four other episodes {{submitted}} by the Family Guy production team for consideration of an Emmy Award nomination, in the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series category. [...] "And I'm Joyce Kinney" [...] was submitted, along with [...] "Halloween on Spooner Street", [...] "Road to the North Pole", [...] "New Kidney in Town" [...] and [...] "Trading Places". The series was successfully nominated in 2009, but failed to merit an award.

500|$|Protests {{were also}} raised to another scene. When Aladdin is {{attacked}} by the tiger Rajah on the palace balcony, Aladdin quietly says a line that some people reported hearing as [...] "Good teenagers, take off your clothes," [...] which they considered a subliminal reference to promiscuity. However, according to the commentary track on the 2004 DVD, while Musker and Clements did admit Scott Weinger ad-libbed during the scene, they claimed [...] "we did not record that, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> record that," [...] and said the line was [...] "Good tiger, take off and go..." [...] and the word [...] "tiger" [...] is overlapped by Rajah's snarl. [...] After the word tiger, a second voice can be heard which has been suggested was accidentally grafted onto the soundtrack. [...] Because of the controversy, Disney removed the line on the DVD release.|$|E
500|$|Primo Levi {{suggested}} Anne Frank {{is frequently}} {{identified as a}} single representative {{of the millions of}} people who suffered and died as she did because [...] "One single Anne Frank moves us more than the countless others who suffered just as she did but whose faces have remained in the shadows. Perhaps it is better that way; if we were capable of taking in all the suffering of all those people, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be able to live." [...] In her closing message in Müller's biography of Anne Frank, Miep Gies expressed a similar thought, though she attempted to dispel what she felt was a growing misconception that [...] "Anne symbolises the six million victims of the Holocaust", writing: [...] "Anne's life and death were her own individual fate, an individual fate that happened six million times over. Anne cannot, and should not, stand for the many individuals whom the Nazis robbed of their lives... But her fate helps us grasp the immense loss the world suffered because of the Holocaust." ...|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} that lingers among {{the families and}} other Canadians is if Air India Flight 182 had been an Air Canada flight with all fair-skinned Canadians, would the government response have been different?
