The animators worked closely with executive producer Paul Tibbitt, creator Stephen Hillenburg, and creative director Vincent Waller to ensure the cartoon characters were properly translated into three-dimensional puppets. Hillenburg and Tibbitt provided hands-on feedback on the production on a weekly basis. [...] "They'd check out the weeklies and {{go back and forth}} <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>on</b> the various gags [...] It was really a pleasurable experience when they came to visit, because we come from the same planet. It all felt very easy and natural," [...] Walsh said.|$|E

While Ocasek and Orr split vocal duties on past albums, Ocasek sings lead on all the tracks from Move Like This. In a Rolling Stone interview, Ocasek said, [...] "I was aware that on half of the new songs, Ben would have done better than I did. But we never wanted anybody from the outside."

500|$|The {{producers}} and writers initially formed a general {{plan for the}} show {{through the end of}} a third season, after reading the screenplays for upcoming MCU films. In May 2016, Chloe Bennet likened {{the end of the third}} season to [...] "the end of the first book of S.H.I.E.L.D. ... the end of something bigger and the beginning of a whole new tone for the show." [...] She elaborated that [...] "the storylines that we started at the beginning of season 1 really wrapped up at the end of season 3. We've had some major losses of people who have been <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>on</b> the show since season 1. From the table read to the first day on set, there's definitely a new energy of the show" [...] moving forward. The series was moved to the later timeslot of 10 pm for the fourth season. Jed Whedon said the writers hoped to [...] "skew a little darker because of" [...] this change, with Loeb adding that [...] "It absolutely offers opportunities. I don't know that it changes things all that dramatically [...] I mean, at the end of the day, Marvel is always going to make shows that run somewhere between PG-13 and PG-16. We're not going to be making Deadpool anytime soon on [...]" [...] Marvel [...] "had a long talk with ABC about what can we get away with, so to speak" [...] in the new timeslot, which led to the inclusion of Ghost Rider in the season over one of Marvel's Netflix series, because Marvel felt [...] "that this character was right to tell [...] stories right now" [...] and having him on S.H.I.E.L.D. aided that because [...] "it was so unexpected". Loeb hoped that the combination of the later timeslot and the introduction of Ghost Rider would lead to some viewers who had stopped watching the series over the previous seasons giving it another chance.|$|E

Shortly after her article was deleted, Save the Children rejected Hopkins' claim that she had [...] "spent time" [...] with the crew of one of their ships. [...] "Nor will she set sail <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>on</b> any of our rescue missions", they stated. The deleted Mailonline article was her only contribution to the planned series.|$|E

2500|$|However, as {{recently}} as the first week of March, Chávez called upon Obama to follow the path to socialism, which he termed as the [...] "only" [...] way out of the global recession. [...] "Come with us, align yourself, come <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>on</b> the road to socialism. This is the only path. Imagine a socialist revolution in the United States", Chávez told a group of workers in the southern Venezuelan state of Bolívar. He said that people were calling Obama a [...] "socialist" [...] for the measures of state intervention he is taking to counter the crisis, so it would not be too far-fetched to suggest that he might join the project of [...] "21st century socialism" [...] that the Venezuelan leader is heading.|$|E

Kelly later wrote that he was disappointed in the video, [...] "this one looked like an ad for coffee or sheets... had worked <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>on</b> a couple of videos previously ... that had turned out really well.

On one occasion, I was rehearsing the Mikado overture when I noticed that one of the double-basses was plucking the strings in the opening bars.

Instead he'd appear at the appointed hour for his match, then vanish back into the night without saying a word to anyone. We'd all stay around giving autographs to the fans before {{moving on to the next}} city. Not Pancho. On court, he was totally professional as well as a fantastic player." [...] In a 2005 interview, Ted Schroeder commented on Gonzales's intense demeanor both on and off the court, [...] "We hardly ever spoke a civil word to one another, yet we were friends. He was a very prideful man, not proud, prideful. When you understood that, you understood him.|$|E
2500|$|Germany and the Soviet Union {{discussed}} {{entering into}} an economic deal throughout early 1939. During {{spring and summer}} 1939, the Soviets negotiated a political and military pact with France and Britain, {{while at the same}} time talking with German officials about a potential political Soviet–German agreement. [...] On April 7, Soviet diplomat Georgii Astakhov stated to the German Foreign Ministry that there was no point in continuing the German–Soviet ideological struggle and that the two countries could come to an agreement. Ten days later, Soviet ambassador Alexei Merekalov met with German State Secretary Ernst Weizsacker and presented him a note requesting speedy removal of any obstacles for fulfillment of military contracts signed between Czechoslovakia and the USSR before the former was occupied by Germany. According to German accounts, at the end of the discussion the ambassador stated [...] "there exists for Russia no reason why she should not live <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>on</b> a normal footing. And from normal the relations might become better and better." [...] Other sources claim that it could be an exaggeration or inaccurate recounting of the ambassador's words. Immediately after the meeting, the Soviet ambassador had been withdrawn to Moscow and never returned to Germany.|$|E
2500|$|In 1948, the U.S. State Department {{published}} {{a collection of}} documents recovered from the Foreign Office of Nazi Germany, that formed a documentary base for studies of Nazi-Soviet relations. This collection contains the German State Secretary's account on a meeting with Soviet ambassador Merekalov. [...] This memorandum reproduces the following ambassador's statement: [...] "'there exists for Russia no reason why she should not live <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>on</b> a normal footing. And from normal the relations might become better and better." [...] According to Carr, this document is the first recorded Soviet step in the rapprochement with Germany. The next documentary evidence is the memorandum on the May 17 meeting between the Soviet ambassador and German Foreign Office official, where the ambassador [...] "stated in detail {{that there were no}} conflicts in foreign policy between Germany and Soviet Russia and that therefore {{there was no reason for}} any enmity between the two countries." [...] The third document is the summary of the May 20 meeting between Molotov and German ambassador von der Schulenburg. [...] According to the document, Molotov told the German ambassador that he no longer wanted to discuss only economic matters, and that it was necessary to establish a [...] "political basis", which German officials saw as an [...] "implicit invitation." [...] The last document is the German State Office memorandum on the telephone call made [...] on June 17 by Bulgarian ambassador Draganov. In German accounts of Draganov's report, Astakhov explained that a Soviet deal with Germany better suited the Soviets than one with Britain and France, although from the Bulgarian ambassador it [...] "could not be ascertained whether it had reflected the personal opinions of Herr Astakhov or the opinions of the Soviet Government".|$|E

2500|$|On April 7, a Soviet diplomat {{visited the}} German Foreign Ministry stating {{that there was}} no point in {{continuing}} the German-Soviet ideological struggle and that the countries could conduct a concerted policy. Ten days later, the Soviet ambassador Alexei Merekalov met Ernst von Weizsäcker, the number two man at the Auswärtiges Amt and presented him a note requesting speedy removal of any obstacles for fulfillment of military contracts signed between Czechoslovakia and the USSR before the former was occupied by Germany. According to German accounts, at the end of the discussion, the ambassador stated [...] "'there exists for Russia no reason why she should not live <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>on</b> a normal footing. And from normal the relations might become better and better." [...] though other sources admit that it could be an exaggeration or inaccurate recounting of the ambassador's words. Immediately after that, the Soviet ambassador had been withdrawn to Moscow and never returned to Germany. According to Ulam, future conversations on the topic in Berlin were believed to continue with lower level officials working under the cover of a Soviet trade mission. Starting on 14 April 1939 and continuing right up to August 1939, the German embassy in London received anonymously copies of British diplomatic cables to and from Moscow, detailing London's attempts to have the Soviet Union join the anti-German [...] "peace front". The Foreign Office's diplomatic telegrams were selectively edited to make it sound like that Anglo-Soviet relations were far better than they actually were, and that the talks were going much better than what was the case. The German ambassador to the court of St. James, Herbert von Dirksen judged the cables credible and passed them along in his reports to Berlin. As the Germans could not break the Foreign Office's codes nor did the Abwehr have an agent with access to the Foreign Office's codes, these intercepted cables were not the work of German intelligence. In fact, these cables that sent to the German embassy in London were the work of the NKVD, which had broken the British codes, and seeking to pressure the Reich to come to terms with the Soviet Union [...]|$|E
