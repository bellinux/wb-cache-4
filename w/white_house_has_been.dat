The <b>White</b> <b>House</b> collection of vermeil tableware, previously only {{on display in the}} Vermeil Room, was also utilised for arrangements.

40|$|This article puts {{in context}} why President of the United States of America George W. Bush {{has been unable}} to rally American support for his {{strategy}} to stabilize and transform Iraq. Since the summer of 2003, when Iraqis started to challenge the authority of the Anglo-American occupation, the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> on the defensive, while American support for post-war efforts has dwindled. While developments in Iraq have affected the strategy’s execution, the main problem is the president’s inclination to oversimplify the challenges American troops and diplomats are facing in Iraq, inviting criticism from journalists, experts on nation-building and lawmakers. In many ways, declining approval of Bush’s handling of Iraq results in the public’s lack of confidence that the president and his advisors will be able to accomplish its goals in Iraq. To test this argument, the article analyzes the president’s address to the nation, delivered primetime on June 28, 2005, showing how Americans are not convinced of the soundness of Bush’s strategy...|$|E
40|$|The <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{a symbol}} of American {{democracy}} since its construction in 1800. It was intended by the builders to be {{a symbol of}} the people's access to and participation in their governance. However, in its 200 year history The People's House has gone from open to all visitors to closed to the general public. The participatory nature of American democracy and the awareness of both early and contemporary citizens of their ability to shape and develop the republic have created a complicated and often tension-filled relationship between the representatives of government and those being governed. That relationship has been exhibited and shaped through the security and visitation policies of the White House, with the level of public access to the building often corresponding to the level of approved public interaction with the government during a given political administration. The attitude of the people and those in power towards White House public access reveal their attitudes towards larger ideas such as the appropriate amount of the people's participation in government. This study seeks to better understand themes such as American democracy and the people's struggle to take ownership of their government by exploring three major factors in White House openness: the political agendas of the presidents, the public's attitudes towards their use of White House space and the security of the president...|$|E
40|$|Genre {{specific}} features {{are subject to}} changes due to external factors such as internationalisation and globalisation; (Candlin and Gotti 2004; Cortese and Duszak 2008) but are also due to internal dynamics. This study focuses on evolving aspects of disciplinary discourses recording the transformations undergone by domain-specific genres with particular reference to examining processes of genre variation, evolution and contamination within institutional communication. By genre analysis we aim to describe language use in professional and institutional settings (Bhatia 2004). Within this general framework our focus is on a specific genre of political communication, i. e. the White House press briefing. The briefings are the meetings with the press held by the White House Press Secretary, through which the White House delivers official information and announcements about the President’s daily schedule, explains the administration’s decisions and policies, responds to criticism, provides commentary on current events, and answers the questions posed by the press (Kumar 2007, 235). As reported {{by a number of}} presidency scholars (Perloff 1998; Kumar 2007), the importance of communication and media relations at the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> steadily growing throughout the 20 th century, and nowadays “the president and the news media jointly occupy center stage” (Perloff 1998, 58). The aim {{of this study is to}} explore discoursal aspects of this institutional genre through an investigation of its phraseological clusters with a view to identifying changes in the individual podium’s strategies related to shifting roles according to communicative strategic needs...|$|E
