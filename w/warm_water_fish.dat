40|$|Executive summary We {{measured}} the biological condition of streams in the South Fork Tenmile Creek watershed, Greene County, Pennsylvania {{to evaluate a}} petition to redesignate those streams from High Quality <b>Warm</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Fishes</b> to <b>Warm</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Fishes.</b> We sampled benthic macroinvertebrate fauna at 6 sites within those streams using Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) protocol and compared them to 2 sites sampled concurrently in a nearby PA DEP Exceptional Value reference stream. Based on biological condition scores 5 of 6 sites achieved High Quality status. In fact, half of the sites sampled achieved biological condition scores necessary to merit Exceptional Value status. At one site that did not achieve biological condition scores necessary for High Quality status, we found evidence that restoration could quickly restore the stream to High Quality status, and that factors contributing to impairment were both temporary and reparable through simple implementation of PA DEP prescribed Best Management Practices. Our results contrast {{with that of a}} previous study conducted for the petitioner, which did not find that any of the streams achieved High Quality status...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} 125 years {{numerous}} invasive {{species have been}} introduced into Lake Tahoe. In recent {{years there has been}} an invasion of <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> <b>fishes</b> including largemouth bass [Micropterus salmoides (Lacepède, 1802) ], and bluegill [Lepomis macrochirus (Rafinesque, 1820) ]. These species threaten to displace and decrease native fish populations, and reduce nearshore water clarity. It is believed, with the help of climate change increasing lake temperature, these species are spreading to other areas from established populations on the south shore. Our objective was to determine current distribution and the potential impacts of <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> nonnative <b>fishes.</b> Snorkel surveys were conducted bi-weekly from May to November 2006 and electrofishing was conducted four times within the snorkel survey period at locations where <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> species are already established. Snorkel surveys and electro-fishing revealed that 57 % of monitored sites contained <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> nonnative <b>fish</b> species. At electro-fish sites, number of native fish decreased with increasing nonnative fish species. Comparing historical and current diet data of natives and nonnatives indicated the latter are consuming the same diet items that native fish consumed historically. As a result, where nonnative and native fish habitats overlap, predation on and competition with native fish is likely. Current distributions of nonnative species found during this study are where the next established populations can be expected if their spread is no...|$|R

40|$|Swamps are one {{of those}} types of lentic water bodies, which form links between {{terrestrial}} and aquatic ecosystems. Dehadrai and Tripathi (1976) have characterized these water bodies as waterlogged, shallow water areas with a loose peaty bottom, rich in decaying organic matter retaining water either periodically or shrinking or drying summer months. There are numerous water bodies, including swamps, present in Bangladesh. But all of these water bodies are not used for scientific fish culture. To meet the increasing protein demand and to solve the unemployment problem in Bangladesh, swamps {{should be used for}} fish culture scientifically. This may also be helpful to destroy the habitat of many biological vectors such as mosquitoes. Rahman et al. (1998) reported that swamps are suitable for fish culture in Bangladesh. The bacterial load in swamp water remains undetermined in Bangladesh. A wide range of bacterial flora is abundant in water and associated with fish diseases.

Since previous studies have suggested that the species richness measure is likely not to reflect shifts in community composition from upland specialist to lowland generalist fish species, we conducted a preliminary investigation {{of the relationship between the}} relative abundance of highland endemic and upland restricted fish species and stream temperature. A significant negative relationship exists between increasing temperature and the relative abundance of highland endemic and upland restricted fish species.
