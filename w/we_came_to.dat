5|$|When <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> {{record it}} in the studio we {{struggled}} because there was something just not quite right about it and I wasn't happy about where we'd left it and where we were happy to leave it and we couldn't put our finger on what it was {{and so it was}} a really nice day one day, me and Chris were just trying, I was actually just trying to record bass at the time and me and Chris were just sitting down trying to brainstorm it and work out what was wrong and so I started trying to just do a few different bass lines and stuff. Between the two of us we came up with just this kind of groove, which stays on the same note as opposed to change, it's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and it made it roll along in a much more fluid way. It was a bit mechanical before and it's just interesting how something small like that can really change the whole vibe of a song. It was just nice because from there on it was one of our favourite tracks and it almost didn't get on the record but it's now one of our favourite tracks.|$|E

Monteux later recalled [...] "Debussy was behind me when we played L'après midi d'un faune {{because he did not}} want anything in his score to be changed on account of the dancing.

500|$|As Christmas approached, Loyalists came to Trenton {{to report}} the Americans were {{planning}} action. [...] American deserters told the Hessians that rations were being prepared for an advance across the river. Rall publicly dismissed such talk as nonsense, but privately in letters to his superiors, {{he said he was}} worried about an imminent attack. He wrote to Donop that he was [...] "liable to be attacked at any moment". Rall said that Trenton was [...] "indefensible" [...] and asked that British troops establish a garrison in Maidenhead (now Lawrenceville). [...] Close to Trenton, this would help defend the roads from Americans. His request was denied. As the Americans disrupted Hessian supply lines, the officers started to share Rall's fears. One wrote, [...] "We have not slept one night in peace since <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> this place." [...] On December 22, 1776, a spy reported to Grant that Washington had called a council of war; Grant told Rall to [...] "be on your guard".|$|E
500|$|The {{films of}} Paul Thomas Anderson have been {{compared}} to it. Variety compared There Will Be Blood to the film and called it [...] "one that rivals Giant and Citizen Kane in our popular lore as origin stories about how <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> be the people we are." [...] The Master has been called [...] "movieland's only spiritual sequel to Citizen Kane that doesn't shrivel under the hefty comparison" [...] and the film's loose depiction of L. Ron Hubbard has {{been compared to}} Citizen Kanes depiction of Hearst. The Social Network {{has been compared to}} the film for its depiction of a media mogul and by the character Erica Albright being similar to [...] "Rosebud". The controversy of the Sony hacking before the release of The Interview brought comparisons of Hearst's attempt to suppress the film. The film's plot structure and some specific shots influenced Todd Haynes's Velvet Goldmine. Abbas Kiarostami's The Traveler has been called [...] "the Citizen Kane of the Iranian children's cinema." [...] The film's use of overlapping dialogue has influenced the films of Robert Altman and Carol Reed. Reed's films Odd Man Out, The Third Man (in which Welles and Cotten appeared) and Outcast of the Islands were also influenced by the film's cinematography.|$|E
500|$|According to {{historian}} John Barry, William Arnold was {{banished from}} Hingham {{for reasons that}} were not religious, {{but he does not}} give the actual reason, nor does he cite any sources. [...] Years later, Arnold's son Benedict recorded in the family record: [...] "Memm. [...] <b>We</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> Providence to Dwell the 20th of April, 1636. [...] per me Bennedict Arnold." [...] He was using the name Providence loosely, since Providence Plantation had not yet been founded. The Arnolds initially settled with Roger Williams at Seekonk near the western edge of Plymouth Colony where Rehoboth is today. [...] William Arnold stated in 1659: [...] "for as much that I was one that the very first day entred [...] with some others upon the land of providence, and so laid out my money to buy and helpe pay for it". [...] The settlers could not remain in Seekonk because, if they did, Plymouth would be harangued by Massachusetts for harboring its fugitives. [...] Plymouth governor Edward Winslow gently urged Williams to move with his fellow settlers across the Seekonk River into the lands of the Narragansetts. [...] Most historians agree that it was about June 1636 when the small group of settlers moved across the river and settled {{on the bank of the}} Moshassuck River at a place which Williams named Providence Plantation.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{generally}} well received by fans and critics alike. Variety magazine criticized the episode for [...] "using reworked concepts", but praised {{the production and}} noted its potential. Of the acting, Variety stated, [...] "Duchovny's delineation of a serious scientist {{with a sense of}} humor should win him partisans, and Anderson's wavering doubter connects well. They're a solid team...". Variety also praised the writing and direction: [...] "Mandel's cool direction of Carter's ingenious script and the artful presentation itself give TV sci-fi a boost." [...] The magazine concluded, [...] "Carter's dialogue is fresh without being self-conscious, and the characters are involving. Series kicks off with drive and imagination, both innovative in recent TV." [...] Entertainment Weekly noted that Scully [...] "was set up as a scoffing skeptic" [...] in the pilot but progressed toward belief throughout the season. After the airing of just four episodes, the magazine called The X-Files [...] "the most paranoid, subversive show on TV", noting the [...] "marvelous tension between Andersonwho is dubious about these eventsand Duchovny, who has the haunted, imploring look of a true believer". Keith Phipps, writing for The A.V. Club, praised the episode, rating it an A. He felt that the episode's premise worked well to [...] "set a template" [...] for future episodes, and noted that the chemistry between Duchovny and Anderson was [...] "already there" [...] from the outset. Matt Haigh, writing for Den of Geek, reviewed the episode positively, praising the chemistry between the lead roles and the quality of the script. In 2012, SFX named it the tenth best TV pilot in the science fiction and fantasy genre, saying that it [...] "brought us everything <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> expect from the show". The plot for [...] "Pilot" [...] was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 1995 by Les Martin, under the title X Marks the Spot.|$|E
