The assumptions made included the planetoid and ring particles being spherical, and all particles having equal radii between 2.5 and 10m. Depending on parameters, the simulations involved between 21 million and 345 million particles interacting with each other through gravity and collisions. The goal of the simulations was to assess under <b>what</b> <b>conditions</b> the rings remain stable, that is do not cluster into few bigger bodies.|$|E

25|$|After {{observing that}} most civil-military theory {{assumes that the}} {{civilian}} and military worlds must necessarily be separate, both physically and ideologically, Rebecca L. Schiff offered a new theory—Concordance—as an alternative. One of the key questions in Civil-Military Relations (CMR) theory {{has always been to}} determine under <b>what</b> <b>conditions</b> the military will intervene in the domestic politics of the nation. Most scholars agree with the theory of objective civilian control of the military (Huntington), which focuses on the separation of civil and military institutions. Such a view concentrates and relies heavily on the U.S. case, from an institutional perspective, and especially during the Cold War period. Schiff provides an alternative theory, from both institutional and cultural perspectives, that explains the U.S. case as well as several non-U.S. civil-military relations case studies.|$|E
25|$|After a person, {{program or}} {{computer}} has successfully been identified and authenticated {{then it must}} be determined what informational resources they are permitted to access and what actions they {{will be allowed to}} perform (run, view, create, delete, or change). This is called authorization. Authorization to access information and other computing services begins with administrative policies and procedures. The policies prescribe what information and computing services can be accessed, by whom, and under <b>what</b> <b>conditions.</b> The access control mechanisms are then configured to enforce these policies. Different computing systems are equipped with different kinds of access control mechanisms—some may even offer a choice of different access control mechanisms. The access control mechanism a system offers will be based upon one of three approaches to access control or it may be derived from a combination of the three approaches.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} Fall of 1997, Wesley Aaron Shafer, Jr., {{was found guilty}} of, inter alia, murder. During the {{sentencing}} phase, Shafer's counsel argued that Simmons required the trial judge to instruct the jury that under South Carolina law, a life sentence carries no possibility of parole. The prosecution responded that because the state did not plan to argue to the jury that Shafer would be a danger in the future, no Simmons instruction was required. During deliberations, the jury asked under <b>what</b> <b>conditions</b> someone convicted of murder could become available for parole. The trial judge stated that parole eligibility or ineligibility was not a matter for the jury's consideration. Ultimately, the jury recommended {{the death penalty and}} the judge imposed the sentence. In affirming, the South Carolina Supreme Court held that Simmons generally did not apply to the State's sentencing scheme because an alternative to death other than life without the possibility of parole existed.|$|E

25|$|The Inca state drew its taxes {{through both}} tax in kind and corvée labor drawn from {{lineages}} and administered through a bureaucracy composed largely of local nobility. The corvée labor force {{was used for}} military operations as well as public works projects, such as roads, aqueducts, and storage buildings known as tampu and qollqa. There were parallel institutions of lineage-based colonies known as mitmaqkuna, which produced goods for the state and provided strategic security in newly acquired areas, and yanakuna, which were retainers with labor obligations to higher members of the state. Lands belonging to the Sapa Inca, the state church, and to panaqas (lineages descending from individual Sapa Incas according {{to the principle of}} split inheritance) were often vertical arrayed to access a variety of resources. Indeed, it has been widely suggested that the terraces at Moray were testing grounds for determining which crops would grow under <b>what</b> <b>conditions</b> in order to more efficiently exploit ecozones.

500|$|Director Neil Marshall {{lived near}} {{the ruins of}} Hadrian's Wall, a Roman {{fortification}} built to defend England against Scotland's tribes. The director fantasised about <b>what</b> <b>conditions</b> would cause the Wall to be rebuilt and imagined a lethal virus would work. Marshall had also visualised a mixture of medieval and futuristic elements: [...] "I had this vision of these futuristic soldiers with high-tech weaponry and body armour and helmets—clearly from the future—facing a medieval knight on horseback." [...] The director favoured the English/Scottish border as the location for a rebuilt wall, finding the location more plausible than a lengthy boundary between the United States and Canada. Additionally, Scotland is the home to multiple castles, which fit Marshall's medieval aspect.|$|E

500|$|The second chapter, [...] "The Great Experiment", {{continues}} {{the examination of}} Stone Age progress {{by looking at the}} advancements in hunting. Wright uses the term [...] "progress trap" [...] to refer to innovations that create new problems for which the society is unable or unwilling to solve, or inadvertently create conditions that are worse than what existed before the innovation. For example, innovations in hunting during the Stone Age allowed for more successful hunts and consequently more free time during which culture and art were created (e.g. cave paintings, bone carvings, etc.), but also led to extinctions, most notably of megafauna. As smaller and smaller game were hunted to replace larger extinct animals, the hunts became less successful and culture declined. Agriculture, and subsequently civilisations, independently arising in multiple regions at about the same time, ~10,000 years ago, indicates to Wright that [...] "given certain broad conditions, human societies everywhere will move towards greater size, complexity and environmental demand". The chapter title refers to the human experience which Wright sees as a large experiment testing <b>what</b> <b>conditions</b> are required for a human civilisation to succeed.|$|E
500|$|The {{dominant}} {{question for}} shale oil production is under <b>what</b> <b>conditions</b> shale oil is economically viable.

[...] The various attempts to develop oil shale deposits have succeeded only when the shale-oil production cost in a given region {{is lower than the}} price of petroleum or its other substitutes. According to a survey conducted by the RAND Corporation, the cost of producing shale oil at a hypothetical surface retorting complex in the United States (comprising a mine, retorting plant, upgrading plant, supporting utilities, and spent oil shale reclamation), would be in a range of $70–95 per barrel ($440–600/m3), adjusted to 2005 values. [...] Assuming a gradual increase in output after the start of commercial production, the analysis projects a gradual reduction in processing costs to $30–40 per barrel ($190–250/m3) after achieving the milestone of [...] The United States Department of Energy estimates that the ex-situ processing would be economic at sustained average world oil prices above $54 per barrel and in-situ processing would be economic at prices above $35 per barrel. [...] These estimates assume a return rate of 15%. [...] Royal Dutch Shell announced in 2006 that its Shell ICP technology would realize a profit when crude oil prices are higher than $30per barrel ($190/m3), while some technologies at full-scale production assert profitability at oil prices even lower than $20per barrel ($130/m3).|$|E
500|$|Discussions with Russia on NATO {{concessions}} {{in return}} for Russian President Vladimir Putin's attendance had been underway for some months before the summit, and intensified as the summit date drew closer. On May 17, {{in the run-up to}} the NATO summit, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer indicated in a speech that Putin signalled that he might honor the summit with his presence if [...] "the conditions will be right". It is unclear <b>what</b> <b>conditions</b> were under discussion, but it is speculated that Putin's conditions included an enhanced Russian role in NATO decision-making through the NATO-Russia Council (NRC), NATO acceptance of Russia's continued military presence in Moldova and Georgia (the withdrawal of these troops was an obligation Russia had assumed at the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe's (OSCE) 1999 Istanbul summit); a move of NATO members to ratify that same treaty and to place the three Baltic states, that joined NATO in March 2004, under military restrictions. As Putin did not receive satisfaction in discussions ahead of the NATO summit - at least not to the extent that he hoped, he refused to attend the meeting. When NATO officials indicated that Putin would probably not attend the summit, Russia's Foreign Affairs Minister Sergei Lavrov reacted on the same day (June 2) by stressing the importance that Moscow attaches to enhancing its role in NRC and that Russia had not declined the invitation to attend the NRC meeting. Due to the replacement of Putin by Lavrov, the meeting was not held at the level of the Heads of State and Government (as normally would be the case), but at the level of foreign ministers.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 1690s, London {{had only one}} officially countenanced theatre company, the [...] "United Company", badly managed and with its takings bled off by predatory investors ("adventurers"). To counter the {{draining}} of the company's income, the manager Christopher Rich slashed the salaries and traditional perks of his skilled professional actors, antagonising such popular performers as Thomas Betterton, the tragedienne Elizabeth Barry, and the comedian Anne Bracegirdle. Colley Cibber wrote in his autobiography that {{the owners of the}} United Company, [...] "who had made a monopoly of the stage, and consequently presumed they might impose <b>what</b> <b>conditions</b> they pleased upon their people, did not consider that they were all this while endeavouring to enslave a set of actors whom the public… were inclined to support." [...] Betterton and his colleagues set forth the bad finances of the United Company and the plight of the actors in a [...] "Petition of the Players" [...] submitted to the Lord Chamberlain. This unusual document is signed by nine men and six women, all established professional actors, and details a disreputable jumble of secret investments and [...] "farmed" [...] shares, making the case that owner chicanery rather than any failure of audience interest was {{at the root of the}} company's financial problems. Barely veiled strike threats in the actors' petition were met with an answering lock-out threat from Rich in a [...] "Reply of the Patentees", but the burgeoning conflict was pre-empted by a suspension of all play-acting from December until March 1695 on account of Queen Mary's illness and death. During this interval, a cooperative actors' company took shape under the leadership of Betterton and was granted a Royal [...] "licence to act" [...] on 25 March, to the dismay of Rich, who saw the threat too late.|$|E
