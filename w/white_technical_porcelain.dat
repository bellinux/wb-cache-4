40|$|Abstract In this study, the {{production}} of a <b>technical</b> <b>porcelain,</b> for the ceramic dielectric applications by using economical natural raw materials, was investigated. The basic porcelain composition was selected consisting of 30 wt% kaolin, 45 wt% potash-feldspar and 25 wt% quartz. The obtained phases in the sintered samples were investigated by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis, and scanning electron microscopy images. It has been confirmed by these techniques that the main crystalline phases were quartz and mullite. Dielectric measurements of <b>technical</b> <b>porcelains</b> have been carried out at 1 kHz from room temperature to 200 °C. The dielectric constant, loss factor, dielectric loss tangent, and resistivity of the porcelain sample sintered at 1160 °C were 22 - 25, 0. 32 - 1. 80, 0. 006 - 0. 07, and 0. 2 - 9 x 1013 &# 937;. cm, respectively. The value of dielectric constant was significantly high when compared to that of conventional porcelains which did not exceed generally 9...|$|R

The two companies intensified this partnership in the area of technical ceramics in 1936, resulting in the foundation of Rosenthal Isolatoren GmbH, also known as RIG.|$|R
50|$|Reconstructed {{from scratch}} {{as of the}} 1920s, modern Turgutlu is, in {{addition}} to a productive agricultural sector, also an important industrial base structured under a Chamber of Industry founded in 1926. It is home to the production installations of Tukaş, {{one of the most prominent}} producers of canned food (principally vegetables and fruits) in Turkey, as well as to BMC (Turkey), the Turkish branch of the motor vehicle giant BMC, active principally in commercial vehicles, trucks and buses. The town's industrial sector as a whole displays as high a degree of dynamism as its agricultural production, with many small- and medium-sized enterprises active in various fields. Also Seramiksan, one of the leading tile manufacturers of Turkey specialized in the production of ceramic wall and floor tiles, glazed and <b>technical</b> <b>porcelain</b> tiles, has their production installations in Turgutlu.|$|R

40|$|Optical hazing of {{expensive}} <b>technical</b> <b>porcelain</b> tiles is principally caused by isolated {{problems in the}} industrial polishing process that often occur unexpectedly. As such, the percentage of affected packaged tiles depends on {{the time for the}} problem to be recognised and fixed. Quality control is unlikely to detect optical hazing as the viewing conditions are unsuitable. While {{only a small percentage of}} defective polished <b>technical</b> <b>porcelain</b> tiles might be packaged, they are unlikely to be detected until after they are installed. It is unrealistic to expect that whole batches of tiles can be laid out and very carefully inspected under appropriate viewing conditions before installation. Optical hazing of cheaper residential porcelain tiles can also be due to its high porosity. Nanocoatings or waxes are typically used to provide stain protection, filling any pores opened by the polishing, as well as any microcracking induced by inappropriate processing conditions 1. Where tiles are covered by a waxy coating, any optical hazing is likely to remain undetectable until after the tiles have been installed. Whole batches of polished residential porcelain tiles may be defective. Tile fixers cannot be made responsible for quality control as they will rarely install tiles under circumstances where the optical hazing will be detected. Although some manufacturers use glossmeters as a quality control measure, these instruments are insufficiently precise: too much light is internally refracted within the glass component of the tile surface. The only realistic option is to install appropriate artificial vision equipment at the end of the polishing train in order to detect any problem as soon as it has occurred. The University of Pisa has conducted extensive research into the optical phenomena associated with the polishing and surface modification of stones, using several different analytical techniques. This theoretical understanding has led to various prototype devices, and the granting of patents. A novel scanning reflectometer is now being commercially developed, with one production line model and another for use in the plant or laboratory. Now that we can measure optical hazing, we should be able to reach a consensus as to what is unacceptable, so that we can develop acceptance standards, and adopt quality classifications. Since the reflectometer can be used to control and optimise polishing processes and effectively correlates surface roughness and reflectance, it might also have some potential applications with respect to slip resistance assessment...|$|R

2500|$|As Duke {{worked against}} the drive, Sloan aimed to {{organize}} a union free of political influence {{and focused on the}} inclusion {{of a wide variety of}} employees. He believed that winning the election required involving all individuals in the “collective struggle.” [...] Although the focus on unity clouded the racially charged, anti-segregation sentiments of the first drive, workers believed it might eventually give them union representation. Depoliticizing the drive meant refraining from methods that could offend <b>white</b> <b>technical</b> or clerical workers as well as including some secretaries and many white workers in unionization efforts. [...] Prevented from publicizing individual [...] grievances because they were centered on race, the second drive failed to generate as much support as the first. As a result, while Sloan was able to gather support from a wide variety of individuals and avoid divisive politics, the urgency and motivation that characterized the 1974-1976 drive was absent in the second. [...] In the end, Duke’s intimidation schemes and the general lack of spirit undermined the drive. By February 16, 1979, workers rejected the union in a 995-761 vote, resulting in a margin four times the size of that in 1976.|$|R
