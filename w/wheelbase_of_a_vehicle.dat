5000|$|The <b>wheelbase</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{equals the}} {{distance}} between its front and rear wheels. At equilibrium, the total torque of the forces acting on a vehicle is zero. Therefore, the wheelbase {{is related to the}} force on each pair of tires by the following formula: ...|$|E
50|$|Wheel {{unloading}} can {{be caused}} by twist in the track. This can arise if the cant (crosslevel, or superelevation) of the track varies considerably over the <b>wheelbase</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle,</b> and the vehicle suspension is very stiff in torsion. In the quasi-static situation it may arise in extreme cases of poor load distribution, or on extreme cant at low speed.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>wheelbase</b> <b>of</b> 1400mm {{supported}} <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> length <b>of</b> 2300 mm. The {{width and}} height were respectively 1350 mm and 1450 mm.

40|$|In {{this second}} paper, we first show how to {{estimate}} the <b>wheelbase</b> length <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> using line metrology in video. We then address the vehicle fingerprinting problem using vehicle silhouettes and color invariants. We combine the acoustic metrology and classification results discussed in Part I with the video results to improve estimation performance and robustness. The acoustic video fusion is achieved in a Bayesian framework by assuming conditional independence of the observations of each modality. For the metrology density functions, Laplacian approximations are used for computational efficiency. Experimental results are given using field data.

25|$|A speed table (or {{flat top}} hump or raised {{pedestrian}} crossing) is {{designed as a}} long speed hump with a flat section in the middle. Speed tables are generally {{long enough for the}} entire <b>wheelbase</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> passenger car to rest on top. The long, flat design allows cars to pass without slowing as significantly as with speed humps or cushions. Because they slow cars less than similar devices, speed tables are often used on roads with typical residential speed limits.|$|R
5000|$|In {{road vehicle}} design, Cab forward, {{also known as}} Cab-over, COE (Cab Over Engine), or forward control, is <b>a</b> body style <b>of</b> truck, bus or van that has a {{vertical}} front or [...] "flat face", with the cab sitting above the front axle. This body design allows for a more compact configuration. For example, the Jeep Forward Control model {{was the first time}} the payload (or pickup box) length - 9 ft with the tailgate up - exceeded the <b>wheelbase</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> truck.|$|R
50|$|It had <b>a</b> <b>wheelbase</b> <b>of</b> 93 in, <b>a</b> track <b>of</b> 61 (front) and 63 (rear), and <b>a</b> weight <b>of</b> 822 lb {{with twin}} cam engine.|$|R

5000|$|Though {{automotive}} restoration {{is commonly}} {{defined as the}} reconditioning <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> [...] "from original condition {{in an effort to}} return it to like-new condition," [...] There are many styles <b>of</b> which <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> can be restored, any of which can be performed at the discretion, desire, or taste <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> owner or restorer.|$|R
50|$|The wagons without hand brakes had <b>a</b> <b>wheelbase</b> <b>of</b> 3,000 mm, <b>a</b> {{length over buffers}} of 6,600 mm {{and their}} unladen weight was 7.3 tonnes. The open wagons with a brakeman's cab had <b>a</b> <b>wheelbase</b> <b>of</b> 3,300 mm, their length over buffers was 7,300 mm and their unladen weight was 8.6 tonnes.|$|R

30|$|Because <b>a</b> <b>vehicle’s</b> {{trajectory}} is in two-dimensional plane, it {{is complex}} to determine the running distance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> directly. The traffic operations are approximate to be in one dimension. Therefore, the time interval is multiplied by the average speed at time t and t +  1 so as to obtain the running distance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> between the time t and t +  1.|$|R
50|$|In transport, driver {{visibility}} is {{the maximum}} distance {{at which the}} driver <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> can see and identify prominent objects around the vehicle. Visibility is primarily determined by weather conditions (see visibility) and by <b>a</b> <b>vehicle's</b> design. The parts <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> that influence visibility include the windshield, the dashboard and the pillars. Good driver visibility is essential to safe road traffic.|$|R
50|$|In outdoor parking lots, GPS {{can be used}} to {{remember}} the location <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> (some apps saves location automatically when turning off the car when a smartphone breaks communication with <b>a</b> <b>vehicle's</b> Bluetooth connection). In indoor parking lots, one option is to record one's Wi-Fi signature (signal strengths observed for several detectable access points) {{to remember}} the location <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle.</b>|$|R
50|$|Roll rate is {{analogous}} to <b>a</b> <b>vehicle's</b> ride rate, but for actions that include lateral accelerations, causing <b>a</b> <b>vehicle's</b> sprung mass to roll about its roll axis. It is expressed as torque per degree of roll of the vehicle sprung mass. It is influenced by factors including {{but not limited to}} vehicle sprung mass, track width, CG height, spring and damper rates, roll center heights of front and rear, anti-roll bar stiffness and tire pressure/construction. The roll rate <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> can, and usually does, differ front to rear, which allows for the tuning ability <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> for transient and steady state handling. The roll rate <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> does not change the total amount of weight transfer on the vehicle, but shifts the speed at which and percentage of weight transferred on a particular axle to another axle through the vehicle chassis. Generally, the higher the roll rate on <b>an</b> axle <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vehicle,</b> the faster and higher percentage the weight transfer on that axle.|$|R
