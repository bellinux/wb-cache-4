5|$|Like most European nations the Scots in {{this period}} began to covert from the bow to {{gunpowder}} firearms. Handguns were present in Scottish armies in small numbers from the fifteenth century and there are increasingly frequent references to handguns and arquebus in records. An account of the Scottish vanguard at Haddon Rig in 1542 suggests that half the troops were missile men and half of those were arquebusiers. Equal proportions of missile to melee troops {{seems to have been}} an aim of Scottish commanders for most of the century, although it was not always possible in the field. The main source of firearms were the French, <b>who</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> extensively rearmed the Scottish after the English invasions of the Rough Wooing.|$|E

In an evening speech on election day, Verhofstadt conceded defeat {{and asked for a}} new generation to lead the VLD; he was to step down as prime minister after formation of a new government. However, the formation of a new government was complicated, and in the end, CD politician Yves Leterme failed to bring about a new government.|$|E

Casualties of these fights, excluding Indians and the outlaws <b>who</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been left where slain or hanged and buried wherever expedient, were interred at the city cemetery; an example is Texas Ranger Captain Michael E. van Buren, who died in 1851 as a result of wounds suffered during a fight with Indians.|$|E
25|$|From 1850 on, small {{communities}} established themselves in elsewhere in Azerbaijan. Soon {{the community of}} Baku counted {{the largest number of}} believers in the region and in 1860 obtained official recognition from the authorities. The community recognized the newly announced position of Bahá'u'lláh. Soon there was more public awareness and some favor from leaders of the broader community {{and at the same time}} the Bahá'í community of Baku broadened its communication with other Bahá'í communities in Russia, Turkey and Ashkhabad and did much work printing materials in Turkish. The most publicly recognized member of the community approaching 1900 was Musa Nagiyev, one of Azerbaijan's richest citizens of the times though there were many public figures before and after <b>who</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> admired the religion or even been members of it.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the most}} {{intriguing}} evidence of early domestication comes from the Botai culture, found in northern Kazakhstan. The Botai culture was a culture of foragers <b>who</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> adopted horseback riding in order to hunt the abundant wild horses of northern Kazakhstan between 3500–3000 BCE. Botai sites had no cattle or sheep bones; the only domesticated animals, in addition to horses, were dogs. Botai settlements in this period contained between 50–150 pit houses. Garbage deposits contained tens to hundreds of thousands of discarded animal bones, 65% to 99% of which had come from horses. Also, there has been evidence found of horse milking at these sites, with horse milk fats soaked into pottery shards dating to 3500 BCE. Earlier hunter-gatherers who lived in the same region had not hunted wild horses with such success, and lived for millennia in smaller, more shifting settlements, often containing less than 200 wild animal bones.|$|E

25|$|Apart from writing, the {{fundamental}} priestly sciences were arithmetics and calendrics. Within the social {{group of the}} priests at court, it had by Classical times become customary to deify the numbers {{as well as the}} basic day-unit, and – particularly in the south-eastern kingdoms of Copan and Quirigua – to conceive the mechanism of time as a sort of relay or estafette in which the 'burden' of the time-units was passed on from one divine numerical 'bearer' to the next one. The numbers were personified not by distinctive numerical deities, but by some of the principal general deities, who were thus seen to be responsible for the ongoing 'march of time'. The day-units (k'in) were often depicted as the patrons of the priestly scribes and diviners (ah k'in) themselves, that is, as Howler Monkey Gods, <b>who</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been conceived as creator deities in their own right. In the Postclassic period, the time-unit of the katun was imagined as a divine king, as the 20 named days still are among the traditional 'day-keepers' of the Guatemalan Highlands. On a more abstract level, the world was assumed to be governed by certain fundamental numbers, first of all the numbers 13 and 20 that, multiplied, defined both the mantic day count and, on a vast scale, the amount of time elapsed before the first day (5 Imix 9 Kumk'u) of the Long Count.|$|E
500|$|However, Dyson was not {{the first}} to advance this idea.

500|$|Carrick {{was located}} in the Firth of Clyde, in the Irish Sea region far from the main centres of Scottish and Anglo-Norman {{influence}} lying to its east and south-east. Carrick was separated from Kyle {{in the north and}} north-east by the River Doon, and from Galloway proper by Glenapp and by the adjacent hills and forests. There were three main rivers, the Doon, the Girvan and the Stinchar, though most of the province was hilly, meaning that most wealth came from animal husbandry rather than arable farming. The population of Carrick, like that in neighbouring Galloway, consisted of kin groups governed by a [...] "chief" [...] or [...] "captain" [...] (cenn, Latin capitaneus). Above these captains was the Cenn Cineoil ("kenkynolle"), the [...] "kin-captain" [...] of Carrick, a position held by the mormaer; it was not until after Donnchadh's death that these two positions were separated. The best recorded groups are Donnchadh's own group (known only as de Carrick, [...] "of Carrick") and the Mac Cennétig (Kennedy) family, <b>who</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> provided the earldom's hereditary stewards.|$|E

[...] Actor Rob James-Collier, who played Liam Connor in the soap, has deemed Betty to be one of Coronation Streets two best characters, alongside Jack Duckworth (Bill Tarmey). He explained: [...] "Betty Driver, who plays Betty can have no {{more than a couple of}} lines in a scene, but she’ll steal it off all the other actors with just a comedy reaction.
