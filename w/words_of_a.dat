5|$|The main medieval Germanic {{cognates}} (<b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> common origin) of elf are Old Norse alfr, plural alfar, and Old High German alp, plural alpî, elpî (alongside {{the feminine}} elbe). These words {{must come from}} Common Germanic, the ancestor-language of English, German, and the Scandinavian languages: the Common Germanic forms must have been *ɑlβi-z and ɑlβɑ-z.|$|E
5|$|As a young man, Lincoln was a {{religious}} skeptic, or, in the <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> biographer, an iconoclast. Later in life, Lincoln's {{frequent use of}} religious imagery and language might have reflected his own personal beliefs or {{might have been a}} device to appeal to his audiences, who were mostly evangelical Protestants. He never joined a church, although he frequently attended with his wife. However, he was deeply familiar with the Bible, and he both quoted and praised it. He was private about his beliefs and respected the beliefs of others. Lincoln never made a clear profession of Christian beliefs. However, he did believe in an all-powerful God that shaped events and, by 1865, was expressing those beliefs in major speeches.|$|E
5|$|The cantata was {{commissioned}} by the minister {{of one of the}} churches in Mühlhausen, the city where Bach worked at the time. It was possibly written for a special occasion. The text is based on Luther's German version of Psalm 130 and also incorporates the <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> chorale. Bach's music integrates melodies from the chorale into larger structures. Bach also shows his interest in counterpoint, something which was characteristic of him throughout his career.|$|E

5|$|Through his freemason {{contacts}} with Pierre Maurice Glayre, Piattoli won {{the confidence of}} Poland's King Stanisław August Poniatowski, becoming his agent in Paris and, {{by the end of}} 1789, his private secretary and librarian, although without any official title. Acting as a sort of cultural aide, Piattoli, who had strong ties to the reformist and often anti-royal opposition, became an important link between the reformers—Ignacy Potocki in particular—and the king. In the <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Swedish diplomat, L. Engstrom, he was “like a tireless spring”, constantly mediating between the two factions.|$|E
5|$|After Andromeda there {{followed}} {{a period of}} several years in which Mantua made little use of Monteverdi's services. Duke Ferdinando died on 26 October 1626 and was succeeded by Don Vincenzo, who became Duke Vincenzo II. Early in 1627 Striggio approached Monteverdi with a request for theatrical music, possibly for the festivities that would celebrate Vincenzo's accession. Monteverdi replied offering three options: first, Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda ("The Battle of Tancred and Clorinda"), a setting from Torquato Tasso's epic poem Gerusalemme liberata ("Jerusalem Delivered"), which had been performed at the 1624 Venice Carnival; secondly, a setting from another part of Tasso's poem, covering the story of the sorceress Armida and her abandonment by the Christian hero Rinaldo; finally, he offered to set the <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new play by Giulio Strozzi, Licori finta pazza inamorata d'Aminta, about a woman who feigns madness for the sake of love. Monteverdi sent Striggio a copy of Strozzi's play on 7 May 1627; Striggio liked it and instructed Monteverdi to begin the music.|$|E
25|$|When {{it is not}} {{possible}} for a law to be authentically interpreted, recourse must be had to what is called magisterial, or doctrinal, interpretation, for which rules of law have been formulated. The <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> law must be understood according to their usual signification, unless it is certain that the legislator intended them to be taken in another sense, or the rules of law dictate another interpretation. In all interpretations, however, the meaning of the words is to be preferred which favours equity rather than strict justice. The provisions of a previous statute are not presumed to be changed beyond the express meaning of the <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new law. No <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> law are ever presumed to be superfluous. In interpreting a law the words must be considered in their context. When the <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> law are doubtful the presumption is in favour of the subjects, not of the lawgiver.|$|E

50|$|In linguistics, conversion, {{also called}} zero derivation, is <b>a</b> kind <b>of</b> <b>word</b> {{formation}} involving the creation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> (<b>of</b> <b>a</b> new <b>word</b> class) from <b>an</b> existing <b>word</b> (<b>of</b> <b>a</b> different <b>word</b> class) without {{any change in}} form, which is to say, derivation using only zero. For example, the noun green in golf (referring to a putting-green) is derived ultimately from the adjective green.|$|R
