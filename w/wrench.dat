5|$|At Union Station, {{the cars}} are loaded onto a train car {{with the help of}} <b>Wrench.</b> Steve arrives shortly {{thereafter}} and after bribing <b>Wrench,</b> is surprised to find Charlie and the others waiting for him. Steve brandishes a gun and demands his gold back, but Mashkov arrives; Charlie explains that he has offered Mashkov part of the gold and Steve in exchange for helping with security protection. Steve is punched in the face by Stella before being taken away by Mashkov, who reveals he will be tortured and killed. The group boards the train as it departs to New Orleans, and celebrate in John's honor. The epilogue shows them all having used their share of the gold for their own desired purposes; Handsome Rob purchases an Aston Martin Vanquish, Left Ear buys a mansion in southern Spain, while Napster buys a powerful stereo capable of blowing a woman's clothes off. Meanwhile, Charlie takes John's advice about finding someone he wants {{to spend the rest of}} his life with, and he and Stella travel to Venice together.|$|E
40|$|Sprag handle <b>wrenches</b> {{have been}} {{proposed}} for general applications in which conventional pawl-and-ratchet <b>wrenches</b> and sprag and cam "clickless" <b>wrenches</b> are now used. Sprag handle <b>wrenches</b> are so named because they would include components that would function both as parts of handles and as sprags (roller locking/unlocking components). In comparison {{with all of the}} aforementioned conventional <b>wrenches,</b> properly designed sprag handle <b>wrenches</b> could operate with much less backlash; in comparison with the conventional clickless <b>wrenches,</b> sprag handle <b>wrenches</b> could be stronger and less expensive (because the sprags would be larger and more easily controllable than are conventional sprags and cams) ...|$|R

Adjustable coach <b>wrenches</b> for the odd-sized nuts of wagon wheels were manufactured in England and exported to North America in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. The mid 19th century began to see patented <b>wrenches</b> which used a screw to narrowing or widening the jaws, including patented monkey <b>wrenches.</b>|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, {{back in the}} restaurant, the {{waitress}} returns to find the woman missing. Believing that the woman has left without paying the bill, she angrily crumples and throws the woman's comic book into a bin. This makes the hero's two opposing racers reappear, armed with a large pipe <b>wrench.</b> The racers smash the looking glass with the pipe <b>wrench,</b> trapping {{the woman in the}} comic book. The hero punches one of the thugs and retreats with the woman into a maze of paper. Arriving at a dead end, he tears a hole in the paper wall so that the woman can escape as the menacing opposing racers close in on him. The woman, now back in the real world and found lying beside the bin to the surprise of restaurant guests and staff, retrieves the comic from the bin and runs home, where she attempts to smooth out the creases to learn what happens next.|$|E
5|$|Placement of the implant: The implant screw {{is placed}} {{and can be}} self-tapping, {{otherwise}} the prepared site is tapped with an implant analog. It is then screwed into place with a torque controlled <b>wrench</b> at a precise torque {{so as not to}} overload the surrounding bone (overloaded bone can die, a condition called osteonecrosis, which may lead to failure of the implant to fully integrate or bond with the jawbone).|$|E
5|$|Chris Brandkamp {{produced}} most of {{the ambient}} and incidental sounds in the game. To make sure the sounds fit, Brandkamp {{had to wait until}} the game's visuals were placed in context. Sound effects were drawn from unlikely sources; the noise of a fire in a boiler was created by driving slowly over stones in a driveway, because recordings of actual fire did not sound like fire burning. The chimes of a large clock tower were simulated using a <b>wrench,</b> then transposed to a lower pitch.|$|E

Because steam sterilization processes like an autoclave are applied to the dental torque <b>wrenches</b> and the length of time in use presents stress on the material, fatigue can occur.|$|R
5|$|Domnall's rise {{to power}} in the Kingdom of Dublin took place in 1075, after the {{expulsion}} of the reigning Gofraid mac Amlaíb meic Ragnaill, King of Dublin by the latter's overlord, Toirdelbach Ua Briain, King of Munster. The circumstances surrounding Domnall's accession are uncertain. He may have collaborated with Gofraid to <b>wrench</b> the kingdom from {{the grip of the}} Uí Briain, or he may have been installed in the kingship by Toirdelbach himself, and ruled under the latter's overlordship. Whatever the case, Domnall died within the year, and Toirdelbach placed his own son, Muirchertach, upon the throne.|$|E
5|$|Carrion, fungi, fruits such as chokecherry (Prunus virginiana), {{and seeds}} are also eaten. Two grey jays were seen eating slime mold (Fuligo septica) near Kennedy Hot Springs in the Glacier Peak Wilderness, Washington. This {{was the first}} report of any bird {{consuming}} slime mold in the field. Risk and energy expenditure are factors in food selection for the grey jay, which selects food {{on the basis of}} profitability to maximize caloric intake. Increased handling, searching, or recognition times for a preferred food item lowers its profitability. Grey jays <b>wrench,</b> twist, and tug food apart, unlike other birds known as jays (such as the blue jay, Cyanocitta cristata), which grasp and hammer their food. Grey jays commonly carry large food items to nearby trees to eat or process for storage, possibly as defense against large scavengers.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{entered the}} Americas through Beringia, and {{evidence}} documents {{their interactions with}} Columbian mammoths. Tools made from Columbian mammoth remains have been discovered in several North American sites. At Tocuila, Mexico, mammoth bones were quarried 13,000 years ago to produce lithic flakes and cores. At the Lange-Ferguson Site in South Dakota, the remains of two mammoths were found with two 12,800-year-old cleaver choppers made from a mammoth shoulder blade; the choppers {{had been used to}} butcher the mammoths. At the same site, a flake knife made from a long mammoth bone was also found wedged against mammoth vertebrae. At Murray Springs, archaeologists discovered a 13,100-year-old object made from a mammoth femur; the object is thought to be a shaft <b>wrench,</b> a tool for straightening wood and bone to make spear-shafts (the Inuit use similar tools).|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1981 Chapter 1 Growth and Survival of Root-Wrenched Douglas-fir Seedlings Root <b>wrenching</b> of {{seedlings}} (severing {{the roots}} 15 cm below the soil surface) was investigated as a nursery practice to improve {{growth and survival}} of field-planted Douglas-fir from six local seed sources in the Pacific Northwest. At lifting, shoots of <b>wrenched</b> seedlings were shorter, lighter, and had smaller diameters than those of unwrenched seedlings. Among seedlings from four of the seed sources, <b>wrenching</b> resulted in significantly lighter taproots but did not significantly affect lateral root and total root weights. There {{were no significant differences}} between these measurements among <b>wrenched</b> and unwrenched seedlings from the other two sources. Mainly because of lighter shoots, shoot-root ratios were smaller for <b>wrenched</b> than for unwrenched seedlings. In no case did root <b>wrenching</b> improve field height growth or survival after one year, and among four of the sources shoot growth was significantly less than that of unwrenched seedlings. Chapter 2 Water Relations of Root-wrenched Douglas-fir Seedlings Root <b>wrenching</b> was investigated as a nursery practice to precondition Douglas-fir seedlings to droughty field conditions. <b>Wrenching</b> shocked the seedlings while in the nursery, lowering plant water potential and transpiration rate. After planting, however, <b>wrenched</b> and unwrenched seedlings transpired at equal rates when exposed to stress with osmotic solutions of Polyethylene Glycol 1000 and under field conditions. Throughout exposure in pots to a drought simulating the Pacific Northwest summer drought, <b>wrenched</b> and unwrenched seedlings did not differ in plant water potential, leaf relative water content, or seedling condition. However, all <b>wrenched</b> seedlings of four seed sources reflushed in the middle of the drought and had significantly fewer active roots than unwrenched seedlings. Among the four seed sources used, differences in ability to withstand drought were apparent...|$|R

5|$|The men torment the {{bound and}} gagged Sally while Leatherface, now {{dressed as a}} woman, serves dinner. Leatherface and the {{hitchhiker}} bring down Grandpa (John Dugan), one of the desiccated bodies from upstairs. He is revealed to be alive when he sucks blood from a cut on Sally's finger. They decide that Grandpa, the best killer in the old slaughterhouse, should kill Sally. He tries to hit her with a hammer but is too weak. In the ensuing confusion, she breaks free, leaps through a window, and flees to the road. Leatherface and the hitchhiker give chase, but the latter is run over and killed by a passing truck. Armed with his chainsaw, Leatherface attacks the truck when the driver stops to help; the driver knocks down Leatherface with a pipe <b>wrench,</b> causing the chainsaw to cut his leg. The driver flees, and Sally escapes {{in the back of}} a passing pickup truck as Leatherface dances maniacally in the road with his chainsaw.|$|E
5|$|The mob lit garbage on {{fire and}} stuffed it through the broken windows as the police grabbed a fire hose. Because it had no water pressure, the hose was {{ineffective}} in dispersing the crowd, and seemed only to encourage them. When demonstrators broke through the windows—which had been covered by plywood by the bar owners to deter the police from raiding the bar—the police inside unholstered their pistols. The doors flew open and officers pointed their weapons at the angry crowd, threatening to shoot. The Village Voice writer Howard Smith, in the bar with the police, took a <b>wrench</b> from the bar and stuffed it in his pants, unsure if {{he might have to}} use it against the mob or the police. He watched someone squirt lighter fluid into the bar; as it was lit and the police took aim, sirens were heard and fire trucks arrived. The onslaught had lasted 45minutes.|$|E
5|$|A {{year later}} in the United States, Charlie learns that Steve has resurfaced under a new {{identity}} and is laundering the gold through a Ukrainian jeweler named Yevhen to finance his lavish lifestyle in Los Angeles. Charlie gathers the team, and also recruits John's daughter Stella, a skilled private safe cracker, offering her {{the chance to get}} revenge on Steve for her father's death. They stake out Steve's mansion, and Stella, disguising herself as a cable technician, is able to map out its interior, allowing them to determine the location of Steve's safe containing the bullion. Coincidentally, Steve, unaware of Stella's identity, offers {{to go out on a}} date with her. Charlie devises a plan using explosives to blow the safe while Stella is on the date with Steve, using three heavily modified Mini Coopers to transport the gold out of the mansion. Charlie enlists the help of Skinny Pete for the explosives and <b>Wrench</b> to make the modifications on the cars. However, on the night of the planned heist, they find Steve's neighbors are having a party, and the explosives would draw their attention, and they abandon the plan. Stella inadvertently gives away her identity to Steve by using similar phrases her father used, but the team arrives to help protect her. Steve is shocked they survived but taunts them that he has the upper hand.|$|E

5|$|BioShock is a first-person shooter with {{role-playing}} game customization and stealth elements, and {{is similar}} to System Shock 2. The player takes the role of Jack as he is guided through Rapture towards various objectives. The player collects various weapons and plasmids as they work their way through enemy forces. The player can switch between one active weapon and one active plasmid at any time, allowing them to find combination attacks that can be effective against certain enemies, such as first shocking a Splicer then striking them down with a <b>wrench.</b> Weapons are limited by ammunition that the player collects; many weapons have secondary ammo types {{that can be used}} instead for additional benefits, such as bullets that inflict fire damage. Plasmid use consumes a serum called EVE which can be restored using EVE syringes collected by the player. The player has a health meter that decreases when they take damage. The player can restore their health with medical packs found throughout Rapture. If the player's health reduces to zero, they will be regenerated at the last Vita-Chamber that they passed with limited amounts of health and EVE. A patch for the game allows players to disable these Vita-Chambers, requiring players to restart a saved game if the character dies.|$|E
5|$|Coronation Street aired {{a special}} live episode to {{celebrate}} the sixtieth anniversary of ITV. In the episode Callum and Kylie's sister-in-law Sarah Platt (Tina O'Brien) argue inside the Platt's home. Callum attacks Sarah, overpowers her and threatens her life. Kylie walks in on the struggle and hits Callum {{over the head with}} a <b>wrench.</b> Her actions left Callum bloody and dead on her kitchen floor. The live episode concluded with David returning home to the fatal scene. He decides to help Kylie and Sarah to conceal Callum's murder. He wraps the body up and puts him down a manhole in their garage. The following episode features the trio plotting to dispose of Callum's body in a public space. An ongoing conversion of the garage in a bedroom extension poses a problem and they need to move quickly, but a series of events ruin their plans. Kylie and David are physically sick when they first try to remove the body from the manhole. They are later interrupted by a visit from the police who investigate Callum's abandoned car. Gail then hires Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas) to cover up the manhole with concrete, unaware Callum is concealed inside.|$|E
25|$|A socket <b>wrench,</b> more {{commonly}} referred to as a ratchet, is a type of <b>wrench,</b> or tightening tool, that uses separate, removable sockets to fit many different sizes of fittings and fasteners, most commonly nuts and bolts.

25|$|The pipe <b>wrench,</b> or Stillson <b>wrench,</b> is an {{adjustable}} <b>wrench</b> used for turning soft iron {{pipes and fittings}} with a rounded surface. The design of the adjustable jaw allows it to rock in the frame, such that any forward pressure on the handle tends to pull the jaws tighter together.

25|$|A torque <b>wrench</b> {{is a tool}} used to {{precisely}} apply a specific torque to a fastener such as a nut or bolt. It is usually {{in the form of}} a socket <b>wrench</b> with special internal mechanisms. It was invented by Conrad Charles Bahr in 1918. However, it wasn't until much later on March 16, 1937, that Bahr received U.S. patent #2,074,079 for the invention of the torque <b>wrench.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{contribution}} {{of this paper}} is the expansion of the range of possibilities in the analysis, planning, and control of contact tasks.

Unfortunately, because of the problem of frictional indeterminacy, it is usually not enough to determine the set of <b>wrenches</b> consistent with achieving a contact mode. Some of the computed <b>wrenches</b> may also be consistent with other undesirable contact modes. However, set operations on the cones returned by our algorithm can be designed to find the <b>wrenches</b> consistent only with desired contac...|$|R
