50|$|Many {{consumers}} {{have also been}} reporting problems when attempting to obtain <b>warranty</b> <b>repair</b> or replacement on tools that are covered by the full lifetime warranty. Sears' official position is that the warranty should be honored, {{and much of the}} problem may lie with individual sales associates. In some cases Sears no longer sells particular Craftsman tools, (tape measures, and wood clamps are two examples), making it impossible to replace a tool sold with a lifetime warranty with a similar Craftsman tool that will continue the warranty.|$|E
5000|$|Eventually, in 1971, {{the cost}} to cover <b>warranty</b> <b>repairs</b> became too high for Standel to endure, so CMI (distributor of the Standel and Gibson brands) covered the cost, {{and in doing so}} {{acquired}} controlling interest in the company. By 1972, the Standel brand was replaced by SG Amplifiers (for [...] "Standel Gibson") manufactured in the Standel factory at 4918 Santa Anita Ave., El Monte, California, as the SG Systems brand (often miscalled [...] "SG System"). The SG line was a hybrid design (solid-state preamp, tube power amp) developed by Bob Crooks, and reminiscent of the original Standel hybrid designs of 1963.|$|R

50|$|While the Daihatsu powertrains were {{considerably}} {{more expensive than}} the British units, Alejandro DeTomaso stated that this was more than paid for by lowered warranty claims. In 1984 he said that <b>warranty</b> <b>repairs</b> were down by 70% when Japanese-engined Minis were compared with the BL-engined ones. His biggest problem was that his service network had become overstaffed {{as a result of the}} higher quality engines. To be honest, this surfeit of servicing staff may have also been a result of steadily declining production numbers (down from the forty-thousands in the late seventies to the mid-teens by 1984/1985), something which De Tomaso tried to ameliorate by offering a more luxurious and customisable product than did their main competitor Fiat.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} main types of service {{contracts}} offered. The first {{is offered by}} the manufacturer through the dealership and is usually good at any dealership in the US that has that same franchise. When <b>warranty</b> <b>repair</b> work is required, the dealer submits a claim to the manufacturer and is reimbursed for the repair less the deductible paid by the consumer. Under this type of service agreement there is usually no incentive for the dealer {{to do anything but}} repair the car as reimbursement from the manufacturer is usually profitable.|$|E

50|$|The Curta Type I {{was sold}} for $125 {{in the later}} years of production, and the Type II was sold for $175. While only 3% of Curtas were {{returned}} to the factory for <b>warranty</b> <b>repair,</b> a small, but significant number of buyers returned their Curtas in pieces, having attempted to disassemble them. Reassembling the machine was more difficult, requiring intimate knowledge of the orientation of, and installation order for, each part and sub-assembly, plus special guides designed to hold the pieces in place during assembly. Also, many identical looking parts, each with slightly different dimensions, required test fitting and selection as well as special tools to adjust tolerances.|$|E

25|$|All tolls {{charged by}} SCBL are {{revenue for the}} consortium. Toll {{increases}} are indexed to inflation and regulated by the federal government. The consortium has rarely commented upon the profitability of the bridge, but during the structure's 10th anniversary, {{it was revealed that}} there had been a 30% cost overrun in construction ($330 million), The consortium is forced to cover this out of toll revenue since the federal government ferry subsidy is used to pay for the original tendered price ($1 billion). Operating costs for the bridge have also proven expensive, with <b>warranty</b> <b>repairs</b> for asphalt adherence and the complete replacement of all bridge deck lighting cutting into profits. Toll revenues have fallen over 30% since the bridge opened, largely because of declining tourism traffic and domestic travel and currently range from $25 to $30 million annually. After expenses in 2003, the consortium received a year-end dividend of $2.6 million.|$|R
