5|$|By September, {{the game}} was still unfinished, and almost every Williams {{programmer}} assisted in meeting the deadline for the AMOA trade show. The evening before the trade show, the arcade cabinets were delivered for display. The developers, however, forgot to create an attract mode—an automated sequence designed to entice an audience to play—for the game, and began working on it that night. Early the next morning, the team created the final EPROM chips for the mode and installed them in cabinets. The chips, however, did not work and the designers made additional attempts to correct the problem. Once the attract mode was operational, Jarvis and the team returned to their homes {{to prepare for the}} show. After the show, the developers expanded the game to allow users to play indefinitely. The display model featured five levels, which the team felt <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>enough</b> because of the game's difficulty. Most Williams employees could not progress past the third level and Jarvis's score of 60,000points seemed unbeatable to them. The developers decided it was best to be prepared for players that might exceed their expectations and added more levels that repeated.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{the early}} 1990s, the Northwest Highway ran as a two-lane road (one lane in each direction) {{parallel}} to the former Chicago & North Western rail line (Union Pacific Railroad after April 1995). The distance between {{the road and the}} railroad is relatively constant in the state—roughly 60feet (18.2meters), assuming a two-lane road and impediment-free alignment. This distance <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>enough</b> to hold a 40-foot (12.2meter) bus.|$|E
25|$|Sixth seeded St. John's {{took on the}} {{eleventh}} seeded Ivy League champion Princeton. The Tigers had won their last 21 games, the nation's third longest win streak. While Princeton stayed close early, only down 15–12 at one time, they missed 15 of their next sixteen shots while St. John's pulled out to a sixteen-point halftime lead. The two teams played roughly evenly the second half, but the halftime lead <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>enough</b> and the Red Storm prevailed 65–47.|$|E

In the general classification after three distances, he ranked number 2, {{but in the}} final 10K race he skated 12:57.97 which <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>enough</b> to pass Jonathan Kuck who was leading the overall classification before the start. Kuck ended number 2, Håvard Bøkko third. It also was Kramer's 8th consecutive championship title in European and World allround championship, another unprecedented feat.|$|E
25|$|Carolina's defense {{shut down}} the Eagles offense, only {{allowing}} a field goal and holding Donovan McNabb to just 10 of 22 completions for 100 yards. Rookie cornerback Ricky Manning intercepted McNabb three times, while the Panthers defense recorded {{a total of five}} sacks. McNabb also sustained a lower-rib injury early in the game but stayed in until the second half. Although Carolina's offense only scored 14 points, it <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>enough</b> for the team to earn their first trip to the Super Bowl with a 14–3 win. For the Eagles, it was their third straight NFC Championship Game loss.|$|E

Isma'il Pasha told Gordon that he wished to expand Equatoria into the rest of Uganda, with the ultimate aim of absorbing the entire Great Lakes region of East Africa into the empire that Isma'il wanted to build in Africa. Baker's annual salary as governor of Equatoria had been £10,000 Egyptian pounds (which was about US$1 million in today's money) and Ismail was astonished when Gordon refused that salary, saying that £2, 000/year <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>enough</b> for him.|$|E

25|$|In the 1980s, a {{committee}} {{was set up}} to get La Tinta to municipality status but these pioneers confronted serious problems, including death threats and had to desist. A new committee was formed in 1987, {{but it was not until}} 1999 that the group directed by José Gilberto Artola Choc accomplished the new designation. The reasons they argued to get their independent status were the distance that Panzós was from La Tinta -30km, approximately- the increase in economic activity in La Tinta -and the decay in Panzós after the Verapaz Railroad ceased operations in the 1960s-, the population <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>enough</b> to get the municipality designation and the lack of support that Panzós gave La Tinta.|$|E
25|$|Justice Scalia {{argued that}} the Court thought the {{precedent}} established in the Gerstein case in regards to issues associated with warrantless arrests <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>enough</b> in determining when probable cause is determined for suspects. He also {{argued that the}} court disregarded the guarantees the Fourth Amendment outlined in regards to holding people in custody. Finally, Justice Scalia argued that the Court’s further interpretation of the Gerstein case to mandate that law enforcement must determine probable cause in a set amount of time was unnecessary; he {{felt that it was}} completely unrelated to clearing arrest-related administrative affairs or assigning a judge to the suspect’s case. He also felt that the probable cause determination for suspects arrested without a warrant should be less strict.|$|E
25|$|After a {{scoreless}} first quarter, the Badgers {{jumped to}} a 10–0 lead after freshman running back Montee Ball scored from 10 yards out. Then, {{in a scene}} reminiscent of Iowa's effort at Penn State three weeks earlier, the Hawks rattled off 20 unanswered points, while the defense intercepted Wisconsin QB Scott Tolzien three times. Also similar to the win over Penn State, Tolzien was picked off two times on Wisconsin's final drives that threatened to put Wisconsin in the game again. Unlike that night, Iowa was not trailing in the 4th quarter, they took a 17–10 lead early in the 4th and nearly scored once more up 20–10 in the red zone, but couldn't convert a 4th down. Despite this, the 10-point lead <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>enough</b> for the Hawkeyes to win.|$|E

25|$|Fish was {{of great}} {{importance}} to most of Scandinavia, and particularly so was the herring fishing in the Limfjord and Oresund. The great shoals of herring migrating from the Atlantic into the Baltic to feed were funnelled through certain narrow points and were caught in huge numbers. The amount of fish caught <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>enough</b> to feed the local population and allowed for huge exports of smoked, and especially salted, fish. Great herring markets were organized in southern Scandinavia, most notably at Skanör in Scania, {{which was in the}} Middle Ages part of Denmark. From this market alone, merchant vessels of the Hanseatic League, the powerful medieval confederation of northern German cities, exported upwards of over 100,000 barrels of salted herring during many decades of the Late Middle Ages. Of equal, or even greater importance was cod, often fished on the North Sea and Atlantic, dried to make stockfish, and imported as an important staple, particularly during fast and Lent. Many freshwater fish were also of great dietary or economic importance, such as salmon, eel, pike and bream.|$|E

According to the plan of German general Karl Ludwig von Phull, the Russian troops {{under the command of}} Count Michael Barclay de Tolly had to face the Grande Armée in the Vilnius region; the remaining troops under general Pyotr Bagration would launch an attack to the French southern flank and rear. However, Phull's plan soon proved to be a fatal mistake, as the enormous Grande Armée <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>enough</b> to separate and crush both Russian armies at the same time. Furthermore, the participation of Tsar Alexander I as commander caused more chaos in the Russian army. The Russian forces which were massed along the Polish frontier were obliged to fall back {{in the face of the}} swift French advance.|$|E
500|$|As {{well as the}} harp, Forbes was an {{accomplished}} public reciter; {{in the summer of}} 1930, he won the Scots Verse recital contest at the Aberdeen Music Festival, and was paid by Beltona to make a series of recordings of the poems of Charles Murray. After returning from Paris, he led a troupe of Scottish country dancers – the [...] "Dancers of Don", that he had formed together with Isabella Mitchell. By this time, Forbes's heart was set on studying medicine. However, his father refused to fund his studies, arguing that since there <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>enough</b> work to be done managing the estate, {{there was no need for}} him to study further. Ewan resolved to fund his own studies, aiming to put aside £1,000 to cover the costs. In 1933, he studied under the psychologist Leonhard Seif in Munich, living with the British novelist Phyllis Bottome. Whilst there, he witnessed the German elections which brought the Nazi Party into power, and heard Adolf Hitler speak.|$|E
500|$|Given {{the task}} of {{overhauling}} the Cardinals by owner Gussie Busch (and specifically to unload Templeton), Herzog was looking to trade Templeton when he was approached by Padres General Manager Jack McKeon at the 1981 baseball winter meetings. While McKeon had previously told Herzog that Smith was untouchable in any trade, the Padres were now so angry at Smith's agent Gottlieb that McKeon was willing to deal. [...] McKeon and Herzog agreed in principle to a six-player trade, with Templeton for Smith as the centerpiece. It was then that Padres manager Dick Williams informed Herzog that a no-trade clause had been included in Smith's 1981 contract. Upon learning of the trade, Smith's initial reaction was to invoke the clause and stay in San Diego, {{but he was still}} interested to hear what the Cardinals had to say. While the deal for the players beside Templeton and Smith went through, Herzog flew to San Diego to meet with Smith and Gottlieb over the Christmas holiday. Smith later recalled that, [...] "Whitey told me that with me playing shortstop for the St. Louis Cardinals, we could win the pennant. He made me feel wanted, which was a feeling I was quickly losing from the Padres. The mere fact that Whitey would come all the way out there to talk to us <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>enough</b> to convince me that St. Louis was the place I wanted to be." ...|$|E

Philadelphia was coming off of a 20–17 overtime win over the Green Bay Packers, that included quarterback Donovan McNabb's 28-yard pass to Freddie Mitchell on a famous play known as [...] "4th and 26". This was the third consecutive NFC Championship Game appearance for Philadelphia, and thus they were heavily favored to win. But Carolina's defense only allowed a field goal and held McNabb to just 10 of 22 completions for 100 yards. Ricky Manning also intercepted McNabb 3 times. Although Carolina's offense only scored 14 points, it <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>enough</b> for the team to earn their first trip to the Super Bowl with a 14–3 win.|$|E
