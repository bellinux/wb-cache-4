The constant flow of escapees fleeing the Spanish-held territories to find refuge with the Itza was a drain on the workforce managed by the encomienda system.|$|E

5|$|From {{the sixth}} century, Scotland {{experienced}} {{a process of}} Christianisation, traditionally seen as carried out by Irish-Scots missionaries, including St Ninian, St Kentigern and St Columba {{and to a lesser}} extent those from Rome and England. However, Gilbert Markus highlights the fact that most of these figures were not church-founders, but were usually <b>were</b> <b>active</b> <b>in</b> areas where Christianity had already become established, probably through gradual diffusion that is almost invisible in the historical record.

5|$|From {{the turn}} of the century, gang warfare persisted in the Whitechapel and Aldgate areas of London between groups of Bessarabians and {{refugees}} from Odessa, and various revolutionary factions <b>were</b> <b>active</b> <b>in</b> the area. One event, the Tottenham Outrage of January 1909, by two revolutionary Russians in London—Paul Helfeld and Jacob Lepidus—was an attempt to rob a payroll van, which left two dead and twenty injured. The event used a tactic often employed by revolutionary groups in Russia: the expropriation or theft of private property to fund radical activities.|$|E

5|$|In {{the time}} of Nero, {{senators}} were still primarily from Rome {{and other parts of}} Italy, with some from the Iberian peninsula and southern France; men from the Greek-speaking provinces of the East began to be added under Vespasian. The first senator from the most eastern province, Cappadocia, was admitted under Marcus Aurelius. By {{the time of}} the Severan dynasty (193–235), Italians made up less than half the Senate. During the 3rd century, domicile at Rome became impractical, and inscriptions attest to senators who <b>were</b> <b>active</b> <b>in</b> politics and munificence in their homeland (patria).|$|E

5|$|Tapestry {{production}} {{began with}} design. The designs, or cartoons were typically executed on paper or parchment, {{put together by}} qualified painters, then sent to weavers, often across a great distance. Because cartoons could be re-used, craftsmen often worked on source material that was decades old. As both paper and parchment are highly perishable, few of the original cartoons survive. Once a design was agreed upon its production might be farmed out among many weavers. Looms <b>were</b> <b>active</b> <b>in</b> all the major Flemish cities, {{in most of the}} towns and in many of the villages.|$|E
5|$|The Latin American lesbian {{movement}} {{has been the most}} active in Mexico, but has encountered similar problems in effectiveness and cohesion. While groups try to promote lesbian issues and concerns, they also face misogynistic attitudes from gay men and homophobic views from heterosexual women. In 1977, Lesbos, the first lesbian organization for Mexicans, was formed. Several incarnations of political groups promoting lesbian issues have evolved; 13 lesbian organizations <b>were</b> <b>active</b> <b>in</b> Mexico City in 1997. Ultimately, however, lesbian associations have had little influence both on the homosexual and feminist movements.|$|E
