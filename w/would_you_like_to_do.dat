40|$|Suppose you had {{unexpectedly}} {{received some}} money, for instance a gift or a lottery prize. What <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the money? Why the action {{you chose to}} do is of much importance to you? What {{would you like to}} achieve by that action? This is a simple illustration of the generic level of consumer decision making, henceforth the generic level. It {{is important to note that}} neither money nor unexpec- tedness defines the generic level. Although there are plenty of examples of receiving a windfall, gifts and lottery prizes being two of them, the generic level also concerns situations when expectations rule. For example, people may expect to receive a bumper bonus, an extra profit, a tax return, gain excessive money from a pre- vious budget, or even to inherit some valuable assets from their beloved parents. To a certain degree, people in such situations must ponder of the different ways to utilize the money. The defining features of the generic level concern the mental processes of decision making in which an individual is trying to allocate a consumer resource into different cate- gories of activities (Van Veldhoven & Groenland, 1993) ...|$|E
40|$|From August 2009 until January 2010, Gemma {{met with}} {{patients}} and their doctors, talking to them about their lives and {{what they saw as}} important to their own identity. She first conducted an informal interview with each person, for about an hour. Psychiatrists were asked questions such as “What inspired you to become a psychiatrist?” “What are your interests outside of your job?” “What do you have in common with your patient?” Patients’ questions included “How is your experience as a patient?” “Can you tell me about your life before you where a patient?” “What <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> when you are out of hospital?” “How would you describe your relationship with your psychiatrist?” After a break, Gemma would draw the individual directly onto copper plate, afterwards asking them to imagine what kind of images and ideas {{they would like to see}} in the portrait. This process, resulting in prints in which each person is surrounded by these images and ideas, aimed to move away from traditional written or verbal clinical encounters between patient and doctor towards building an image of the individual formed by what they choose to disclose. For example, “Dr F has a wonderful relationship with her patient (Patient C). Her patient attributes her full recovery to meeting Dr F. When I asked what they had in common she replied “So much! I have just been luckier in my life experiences. ” She is a lover of nature and finds peace when walking or cycling in the countryside or by the sea. She loves elephants, wild animals and birds. ...|$|E
