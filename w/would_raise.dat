5|$|In 1860 {{he became}} organist at Magdalen College, Oxford, {{initially}} {{for a period}} of six months, at a salary of £120 per year. His duties included playing for services, training the choir and leading them on Fridays, a day on which the organ was not used. A new organ had been installed five years earlier that was ideal for developing his talent. He proved satisfactory in the post, and his contract was made permanent. He was permitted to study for a degree as long as it did not interfere with his duties, and he chose {{to do so in the}} expectation that it <b>would</b> <b>raise</b> his social status. He gained his BA in 1864 and his MA two years later and was keen to proceed to his Mus Doc, which <b>would</b> <b>raise</b> his standing within the university.|$|E
5|$|National Park Service {{officials}} {{criticized the}} construction of the Admiral Clarey bridge fearing that by connecting road traffic to the mainland, the increased flow of island visitors <b>would</b> <b>raise</b> the level of theft of historical artifacts from the USS Arizona and other memorials on or around Ford Island.|$|E
5|$|Chico {{pledged to}} hire 2,000 police {{officers}} {{but did not}} offer specifics on how he <b>would</b> <b>raise</b> the funds. He opposed making the school board an elected body, and he favored extending the school day and school year. Chico picked up endorsements from unions that represented, among others, police officers, firefighters, laborers, painters, operating engineers, iron workers, roofers, and sheet metal workers.|$|E
50|$|On Adolphe's death, his son William IV {{came to the}} throne, {{and married}} the Catholic Infanta Marie Anne of Portugal. The {{marriage}} agreement stipulated that all male children <b>would</b> be <b>raised</b> Protestant, and all females <b>would</b> be <b>raised</b> Catholic. The couple had six daughters, and thus the ruling house of Luxembourg became Catholic.|$|R

5|$|Oklahoma President David Boren wrote {{a letter}} to Big12 {{commissioner}} Kevin Weiberg asking for the loss to be erased from Oklahoma's record, something that Weiberg did not support. Weiberg did say that he <b>would</b> <b>raise</b> concerns about the Pac-10 policy of using their own officials for inter-conference games in Pac-10 stadiums. Bob Stoops said that he may cancel the 2008 game scheduled at Washington if the Pac-10 officiating policy is not changed.|$|E
5|$|On March 5, 1735, George Mason III {{died when}} his boat capsized while {{crossing}} the Potomac. His widow Ann <b>would</b> <b>raise</b> their son George (then 9) and two younger siblings as co-guardian with lawyer John Mercer. She selected property at Chopawamsic Creek (today in Prince William County, Virginia) as her dower house and there {{lived with her}} children and administered the lands that her elder son would control upon reaching his 21st birthday.|$|E
5|$|The Antarctic sheet is {{the largest}} known single mass of ice. It covers almost 14 million km2 and some 30 million km3 of ice. Around 90% of the fresh water on the planet's surface is held {{in this area and}} if melted <b>would</b> <b>raise</b> sea levels by 58 metres. The continent-wide average surface {{temperature}} trend of Antarctica is positive and significant at >0.05°C/decade since 1957.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, {{early in}} his term, Kaine pressed the General Assembly to support a {{legislative}} package to ease severe traffic congestion by spending about $1 billion annually for highway construction, repairs to aging roads, mass transit, and other transportation projects. The money <b>would</b> <b>raised</b> through increases in taxes and fees that <b>would</b> have <b>raised</b> an estimated $4 billion in revenue over four years. The Democratic-controlled Senate supported the plan, but the Republican-controlled House was ultimately unwilling to approve the taxes necessary {{to carry out the}} project, however, and the effort failed even after a special session of the Legislature was called over the transportation-funding stalemate.|$|R

5|$|The duckers of Aylesbury {{would buy}} eggs from the breeders, or {{be paid by}} a breeder to raise the ducks on their behalf, and <b>would</b> <b>raise</b> the ducklings in their homes between November and August as a {{secondary}} source of income. Duckers were typically skilled labourers, who invested surplus income in ducklings. Many of the tasks related to rearing the ducks would {{be carried out by}} the women of the household, particularly the care of newly hatched ducklings.|$|E
5|$|The {{estimated}} construction cost did {{not include}} the R$38.1million required for adding temporary bleachers, which were removed after the World Cup was over. They were set on one of the sides and on the north and south ends. The addition of the bleachers <b>would</b> <b>raise</b> the stadium's capacity up to 72,000 seats, but would necessitate the relocation of VIP areas and television equipment reducing capacity. Corinthians paid for additional temporary infrastructure required exclusively for the World Cup, which was estimated to cost between R$60million and 100million.|$|E
5|$|City {{officials}} announced on August 6 that Mayor de Blasio would {{push for a}} tax on wealthy New York City residents {{to help pay for}} necessary improvements in the subway. The proposal would tax New York City residents that make more than $500,000 and for married couples with incomes above $1 million. The proposal <b>would</b> <b>raise</b> between $700 million to $800 million, with $250 of it going for half-priced MetroCards for 800,000 riders at or below the poverty line, a shift from de Blasio's previous stance. To go into effect, {{it would have to be}} approved by the New York State Legislature. This proposal was criticized by Governor Cuomo and MTA Chairman Joe Lhota for not providing money soon enough, the State Legislature does not go back into session until January 2018.|$|E

5|$|Contact with {{extraterrestrial}} civilizations <b>would</b> <b>raise</b> legal questions, such as {{the rights}} of the extraterrestrial beings. An extraterrestrial arriving on Earth might only have the protection of animal cruelty statutes. Much as various classes of human being, such as women, children, and indigenous people, were initially denied human rights, so might extraterrestrial beings, who could therefore be legally owned and killed. If such a species were not to be treated as a legal animal, there would arise the challenge of defining the boundary between a legal person and a legal animal, considering the numerous factors that constitute intelligence.|$|E
5|$|From {{the moment}} Thriller was released, it set the {{standard}} for the music industry: artists, record labels, producers, marketers and even choreographers. The music video was ahead of its time and it is considered a monumental one—not only in Jackson's career, but also in the history of pop music. Epic Records' approach to creating a song and video that would appeal to the mass market ended up influencing the way that professionals now market and release their songs. John Landis's production of a mini-movie, rather than the usual short music video, <b>would</b> <b>raise</b> the bar for other directors and producers.|$|E
5|$|In 1761, Russian polymath Mikhail Lomonosov {{observed}} an arc {{of light}} surrounding {{the part of}} Venus off the Sun's disc {{at the beginning of}} the egress phase of the transit and concluded that Venus has an atmosphere. In 1940, Rupert Wildt calculated that the amount of CO2 in the Venusian atmosphere <b>would</b> <b>raise</b> surface temperature above the boiling point for water. This was confirmed when Mariner 2 made radiometer measurements of the temperature in 1962. In 1967, Venera 4 confirmed that the atmosphere consisted primarily of carbon dioxide.|$|E

5|$|On November 7, Ralston {{called a}} meeting with company and union leaders to begin {{negotiations}} to resolve the strike. The temporary solution was that all workers {{who had not been}} involved in violence could return to work, the company <b>would</b> <b>raise</b> wages by five percent, recognize the union, guarantee a minimum weekly salary, and Thorpe and national union leaders would immediately leave the state. The union and company agreed to later submit all grievances to the Indiana Public Service Commission for arbitration, and agreed that their decisions would be final. The arrangement was submitted to a workers' vote and was approved unanimously; the strike ended at 6:00 pm.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Katherine's words, {{the view}} {{had been for}} Rowe {{to act as a}} {{surrogate}} mother; she would give the baby to Jackson as a friendly favor and he <b>would</b> <b>raise</b> it. Jackson intended to issue a statement following the birth that the identity of the mother was a secret, {{in the same way that}} the identities of many surrogates are protected. Katherine's involvement, however, influenced Jackson to call Rowe and ask her to meet him in Australia, where he was staying, as soon as she could. There, the entertainer announced his plans for them to wed the next day.|$|E
5|$|Representative William McKinley and Senator Nelson W. Aldrich {{framed the}} McKinley Tariff that <b>would</b> <b>raise</b> the tariff even higher, {{including}} making some rates intentionally prohibitive. At Secretary of State James Blaine's urging, Harrison {{attempted to make}} the tariff more acceptable by urging Congress to add reciprocity provisions, which would allow the President to reduce rates when other countries reduced their rates on American exports. The tariff was removed from imported raw sugar, and sugar growers in the United States were given a two cent per pound subsidy on their production. Even with the reductions and reciprocity, the McKinley Tariff enacted the highest average rate in American history, and the spending associated with it contributed to {{the reputation of the}} Billion-Dollar Congress.|$|E

50|$|For example, the U.S. Congressional Budget Office {{estimated}} that the payroll tax (levied on all wage earners) has a higher multiplier (impact on GDP) than does the income tax (which is levied primarily on wealthier workers). In other words, raising the payroll tax by $1 {{as part of an}} austerity strategy would slow the economy more than <b>would</b> <b>raising</b> the income tax by $1, resulting in less net deficit reduction.|$|R

5|$|Rogers {{learned from}} {{questioning}} the prisoners that a French and Indian war party {{had just arrived}} at Carillon, and that the two forts were garrisoned by a thousand regulars. Concerned that the escaped sleds <b>would</b> <b>raise</b> the alarm, Rogers immediately ordered a return to their last camp. His council disapproved of the return by the same route (a violation of Rogers' own ranging guidelines), but he overruled them, citing the need for speed and the deep snow.

5|$|The Bush {{campaign}} advertised {{across the}} U.S. against Democratic candidates, including Bush's emerging opponent, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry. Kerry and other Democrats attacked Bush on the Iraq War, and {{accused him of}} failing {{to stimulate the economy}} and job growth. The Bush campaign portrayed Kerry as a staunch liberal who <b>would</b> <b>raise</b> taxes and increase the size of government. The Bush campaign continuously criticized Kerry's seemingly contradictory statements on the war in Iraq, and argued that Kerry lacked the decisiveness and vision necessary for success in the War on Terror.|$|E
5|$|The CCRC finally {{rejected}} the application in April 2012 in a 109-page report, which said the submission had not identified any new evidence or legal argument that <b>would</b> <b>raise</b> the real {{possibility of the}} Court of Appeal overturning the conviction. In November 2012 the High Court turned down Bamber's application for a judicial review of that decision. The following year di Stefano was sentenced in the UK to 14 {{years in prison for}} having fraudulently presented himself as a lawyer.
