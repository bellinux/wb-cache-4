5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 2000s (decade), the {{increased}} Indian gaming that McCain had helped bring about was a $23billion industry. He was twice chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, in 1995–1997 and 2005–2007, and his Committee helped expose the Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal. By 2005 and 2006, McCain was pushing for amendments to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act that <b>would</b> <b>limit</b> creation of off-reservation casinos, as well as limiting the movement of tribes across state lines to build casinos.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi {{believed}} that swaraj {{not only can}} be attained with non-violence, it can be run with non-violence. Military is unnecessary, because any aggressor can be thrown out using the method of non-violent non-co-operation. While military is unnecessary in a nation organised under swaraj principle, Gandhi added that a police force is necessary given human nature. However, the state <b>would</b> <b>limit</b> the use of weapons by the police to the minimum, aiming for their use as a restraining force.|$|E

In {{a parliamentary}} decision in 2004 {{it was decided to}} opt for the open European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) as a data transmission standard, which is used by all other police TETRA systems in Europe, but this was later changed by the directorate to the proprietary TETRA Enhanced Data Service (TEDS) owned by Motorola. The latter <b>would</b> <b>limit</b> the number of supplies and would increase the investment costs.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} his life, Caesar {{began to}} prepare for a war against the Parthian Empire. Since his absence from Rome <b>would</b> <b>limit</b> his ability to install his own consuls, he passed a law which allowed him to appoint all magistrates in 43 BC, and all consuls and tribunes in 42 BC. This {{transformed}} the magistrates from representatives of the people to representatives of the dictator.|$|E
5|$|Proposals in January 2013 {{to improve}} the bus service to the airport {{involving}} turning emergency lanes into bus lanes on the freeway and the Bolte Bridge and putting SkyBus on a myki fare, were challenged by CityLink operator Transurban, because it <b>would</b> <b>limit</b> its toll revenue, and by Melbourne Airport, because it would reduce its car parking profits.

5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{listed the}} pyjama shark as Near Threatened, citing its small {{distribution}} {{and a recent}} increase in fishing pressure on small sharks in the region. However, {{there is no evidence}} to suggest that its population has declined. There are no specific conservation measures in place for this species, though its range encompasses two marine reserves. The South African Sea Fisheries Research Institute is considering legally decommercializing the pyjama shark, which <b>would</b> <b>limit</b> the degree to which it can be targeted by commercial fisheries.|$|E
5|$|A {{knee injury}} <b>would</b> <b>limit</b> Comminges to just two {{appearances}} during the 2009–10 season, missing {{nine months of}} first-team action {{as a result of}} the injury. He had suffered the injury during training at the club after teammate Jay Bothroyd fell awkwardly onto Comminges, causing his knee ligament to detach. Comminges originally attempted to continue training but was ordered not to by manager Dave Jones on the advice of club doctors, who later discovered the severity of the injury. Comminges' contract was initially due to expire at the end of the season but, having suffered the injury, he was offered a six-month extension by the club until January 2011 in order to regain fitness and improve his chances of finding a new club. His appearance as a 90th-minute substitute in a 3–1 away victory at Plymouth Argyle on 18 August 2009 would ultimately be his last for the club.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the tribes}} made {{progress}} {{in implementing the}} Hathaway plans with the paper and timber companies, Krulitz ceased to support the proposal when {{the full extent of}} the required federal appropriations became clear. Krulitz was replaced with Eric Jankelassistant for intergovernmental affairs to Interior Secretary Cecil Andruswith whom Tureen had previously negotiated the settlement to the Narragansett land claim in Rhode Island. Tureen and Jankelalong with Donald Perkins, a lawyer for the paper and timber companiesnegotiated a solution whereby $30 million of the settlement funds would come from various programs in the federal budget. That settlement was presented to the Maine congressional delegation in August 1979, but they refusal to endorse it until the Maine legislature had approved it. Governor Langley, in turn, refused to accept any deal that <b>would</b> <b>limit</b> the state's jurisdiction over the tribes.|$|E

5|$|Flying at {{low level}} {{provided}} protection against fighters as well. Radars {{of the era}} {{did not have the}} ability to look down; if the radar were aimed down to detect targets at a lower altitude, the reflection of the ground would overwhelm the signal returned from a target. An interceptor flying at normal altitudes would be effectively blind to bombers far below it. The interceptor could descend to lower altitudes {{to increase the amount of}} visible sky, but doing so <b>would</b> <b>limit</b> its radar range in the same way as the missile sites, as well as greatly increasing fuel use and thus reducing mission time. The Soviet Union would not introduce an interceptor with look-down capability until 1972 with the High Lark radar, and even this model had very limited capability.|$|E
5|$|For the 2010–11 season, the Rockets {{said they}} <b>would</b> <b>limit</b> Yao to 24 minutes a game, with no plan to play him on {{back-to-back}} nights. Their {{goal was to}} keep Yao healthy in the long term. On December 16, 2010, {{it was announced that}} Yao had developed a stress fracture in his left ankle, related to an older injury, and would miss the rest of the season. In January 2011, he was voted as the Western Conference starting center for the 2011 All-Star Game for the eighth time in nine seasons. Injured All-Stars are usually required to attend the All-Star functions and to be introduced at the game, but Yao was not in Los Angeles because of his rehabilitation schedule after his surgery. Yao's contract with the Rockets expired {{at the end of the}} season, and he became a free agent.|$|E
5|$|In early February Amundsen began organising the depot-laying {{journeys}} {{across the}} Barrier, {{in preparation for}} the following summer's assault on the pole. Supply depots laid in advance at regular intervals on the projected route <b>would</b> <b>limit</b> the amount of food and fuel that the South Pole party would have to carry. The depot journeys would be the first true tests of equipment, dogs and men. For the first journey, to begin on 10February, Amundsen chose Prestrud, Helmer Hanssen and Johansen to accompany him; 18dogs would pull three sledges. Before leaving, Amundsen left instructions with Nilsen regarding Fram. The ship was to sail to Buenos Aires for reprovisioning, before undertaking a programme of oceanographic work in the Southern Ocean and then returning to the Barrier as early as possible in 1912.|$|E

5|$|Rocksteady {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} a sequel before development of Arkham Asylum had concluded, developing ideas for both the story and setting so the games' narratives could be effectively connected; a secret room was hidden in the asylum warden's office in Arkham Asylum containing hints of how the sequel would progress, including blueprints for the Arkham City prison; the blueprints are quite similar to its final layout in Arkham City. The original idea was to take the game out of the asylum setting and onto the streets of Gotham City while retaining the level of design detail put into the asylum. To that end they wanted to include locations from the Batman mythos that were notable and meaningful to the character, instead of a series of generic streets; Rocksteady was initially unsure how technical considerations <b>would</b> <b>limit</b> the scope of this idea.|$|E
5|$|Sejmiks {{were usually}} {{held in a}} large, open field. The nobility would elect a {{presiding}} officer (marszałek sejmiku: sejmik marshal), whose role was analogous to the marshal of the sejm at national Sejms. (This term has been revived since 1999, but it now refers to {{the chairman of the}} voivodeship executive board rather than the presiding officer of the sejmik itself.) While the sejmiks were originally convened by the king, soon a loophole was exploited: the sejmiks <b>would</b> <b>limit</b> the number of issues discussed, using that as a pretext to reconvene later at a time chosen by the marshal. Voivodes and starosts also had the ability to convene some sejmiks. Until the reforms of the Constitution of 3 May, all the nobility residing in the territory that was holding a sejmik were eligible to participate in the sejmik.|$|E
5|$|The Alversund Bridge was a toll bridge {{which was}} {{paying for the}} debt {{accumulated}} in its construction. By 1968, the debt would be paid off, but the Norwegian Public Roads Administration launched a plan whereby the tolls {{would continue to be}} collected and used to finance a bridge across Salhusfjorden. This was opposed by a group of locals, who brought the issue to the courts, claiming it to be illegal, as a bridge would never be built. Both Oslo District Court and Eidsivating Court of Appeal concluded that the tolls were legal, and the issue was rejected by the Supreme Court. Protests were also raised against the use of a pontoon bridge, as it <b>would</b> <b>limit</b> the vessel size and thus the commercial development in the inner parts of the fjord.|$|E

5|$|The Xbox 360 {{does not}} have support for Steamworks.

Valve attributes the inability to use Steamworks on the Xbox 360 to limitations in the Xbox Live regulations of the ability to deliver patches and new content. Valve's Erik Johnson stated that Microsoft requires that new content must be certified and validated before distribution, which <b>would</b> <b>limit</b> the usefulness of Steamworks' delivery approach.|$|E
5|$|The conversion, said Belhaven, {{would enable}} James Francis Edward's {{accession}} to the English throne upon William III's death. The Queen-Regent was not swayed by Belhaven's argument, so a compromise was reached: James Francis Edward, if he became King, <b>would</b> <b>limit</b> {{the number of}} Roman Catholic priests in England and promise not to tamper with the established Church of England. In exchange, the confederate Lords would do all {{in their power to}} block the passing of the Hanoverian succession in Scottish parliament. When, in March 1702, William III died, Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat, declared for James Francis Edward at Inverness. Soon after, Lovat travelled to the court-in-exile at Saint-Germain, and begged the Queen-Regent to allow her son to come to Scotland. Lovat intended to raise an army of 15,000 soldiers in Scotland, to seize the throne for James Francis Edward. Mary refused to part with James Francis Edward, and the rising failed. Mary's regency ceased with her son's reaching of the age of 16.|$|E
5|$|The team {{considered}} {{utilizing the}} PlayStation Move controller for casting spells in the game, {{in a similar}} fashion {{to the use of the}} touchscreen in the DS version, though ultimately decided against it as it <b>would</b> <b>limit</b> the potential sales. The battle system was revised over ten times, in order to achieve something new and unique. For about a year of development, the battle system used a turn-based system, though this was ultimately changed when the team felt that it was not fun for players. The team eventually merged turn-based combat and action elements, popular in Japanese and Western regions, respectively, in order to appeal to both regions.|$|E
