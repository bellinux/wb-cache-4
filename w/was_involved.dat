It is hypothesized that nonspecific types of DNA damage <b>are</b> <b>involved</b> in the induction of an ongoing process we know as carcinogenesis. Several genes could <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> in maintaining this process. Our recent results suggest that c-myc and c-fos could <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> {{in the early stages}} of carcinogenesis, as they are affected by anticarcinogenic protease inhibitors in a manner that corresponds to the way in which protease inhibitors suppress malignant transformation...|$|R
