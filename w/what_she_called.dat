25|$|In {{her book}} {{she wrote about}} issues such as racial mixing, immigration, {{the role of women}} in {{politics}} and Islam. The book also contained a section attacking <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>called</b> the mixing of genes and praised previous generations who, she said, had given their lives to push out invaders.|$|E
25|$|In 1837, Palmer {{experienced}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>called</b> entire sanctification. She began {{leading the}} Tuesday Meeting for the Promotion of Holiness. At first only women attended these meetings, but eventually Methodist bishops and other clergy members began to attend them also. In 1859, she published The Promise of the Father, {{in which she}} argued in favor of women in ministry, later to influence Catherine Booth, co-founder of the Salvation Army. The practice of ministry by women became common but not universal within {{the branches of the}} holiness movement.|$|E

5000|$|Besides ethical hedonism and the Bonobo Way, Block {{promotes}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>calls</b> “Pleasure Sex”, {{sex that}} is recreational, healthful, relationship-oriented or celebratory {{as opposed to}} reproductive. <b>She</b> also advocates <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>calls</b> “Faith-Based Sex” and “Blue Values”. Cara Jepsen {{put it this way}} in the Illinois Entertainer: [...] "Dr. Susan Block's HBO specials expose inhibited Middle America to the idea that it's OK to discuss—and enjoy—sex...” ...|$|R
500|$|The {{conviction}} {{that she was}} at the center of plots and counter-plots became a feature of Eddy's life. She believed that several students were using <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>called</b> [...] "malicious animal magnetism," [...] or evil thought, against her. (She also referred to it as An. Mag., Mes., M.A.M., m.a.m., mesmerism, malicious mesmerism, animal magnetism, mental malpractice, malicious malpractice, and mental influence.) ...|$|E
500|$|Three years later, writer Annette Carson, in {{her book}} Richard III: The Maligned King (2008), {{independently}} {{came to the conclusion}} that his body probably lay under the car park. She joined forces with Langley and Ashdown-Hill to carry out further research, in the course of which she found <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>called</b> a [...] "smoking gun"—a medieval map of Leicester showing the Greyfriars Church at the north end of what was now the car park.|$|E
500|$|In 1950, Heyer {{began working}} on <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>called</b> [...] "the magnum opus of my latter years", a medieval trilogy {{intended}} to cover the House of Lancaster between 1393 and 1435. She estimated that she would need five years to complete the works. Her impatient readers continually clamored for new books; to satisfy them and her tax liabilities, Heyer interrupted herself to write Regency romances. The manuscript of volume one of the series, My Lord John, was published posthumously.|$|E

40|$|Our aim in {{this essay}} is to {{critically}} examine Iris Young’s arguments in her important posthumously published book against <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>calls</b> the liability model for attributing responsibility, {{as well as the}} arguments that she marshals in support of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>calls</b> the social connection model of political responsibility. We contend that her arguments against the liability model of conceiving responsibility are not convincing, and that her alternative to it is vulnerable to damaging objections...|$|R

500|$|In an August 2012 {{press conference}} {{regarding}} the AWU affair, Gillard {{was critical of}} The Australian newspaper for writing about her connection to the affair and of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>called</b> [...] "misogynist nut jobs on the internet". Gillard {{said that she had}} been [...] "the subject of a very sexist smear campaign". In early October, the Opposition Leader's wife, Margie Abbott, accused the Gillard Government of a deliberate campaign to smear Tony Abbott, on gender issues.|$|E
500|$|Pat Nixon {{felt that}} the First Lady should always set a public example of high virtue {{as a symbol of}} dignity, but she refused to revel in the trappings of the position. When {{considering}} ideas for a project as First Lady, Pat refused to do (or be) something simply to emulate her predecessor, Lady Bird Johnson. She decided to continue <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>called</b> [...] "personal diplomacy", which meant traveling and visiting people in other states or other nations.|$|E
500|$|In December 2015, Lee {{posted a}} cover of [...] "Baby Did a Bad Bad Thing" [...] by Chris Isaak, which she stated was {{originally}} intended {{to appear on the}} album produced by Lillywhite in 2010. She also further explained that the original album did not share any of the same tracks that the version produced by Raskulinecz had, as the record company rejected these recordings. Lee said she used her frustration with being forced to start over to write <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>called</b> [...] "(Evanescence's) heaviest album." ...|$|E

500|$|Although Czolgosz {{repeatedly}} denied Goldman's involvement, {{the police}} held her in close custody, subjecting her to <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>called</b> the [...] "third degree". She explained her housemates' distrust of Czolgosz, {{and it became}} clear that she had not had any significant contact with the attacker. No evidence was found linking Goldman to the attack, and she was released after two weeks of detention. Before McKinley died, Goldman offered to provide nursing care, referring to him as [...] "merely a human being". [...] Czolgosz, despite considerable evidence of mental illness, was convicted of murder and executed.|$|E
500|$|But I'm a Cheerleader is {{not only}} about sexuality, but also gender and the social {{construction}} of gender roles. One {{of the ways in which}} Babbit highlighted <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>called</b> the artificiality of gender construction was by using intense blues and pinks in her production and costume design. Chris Holmlund in Contemporary American Independent Film notes this feature of the film and calls the costumes [...] "gender-tuned." [...] Ted Gideonse in Out magazine wrote that the costumes and colors of the film show how false the goals of True Directions are.|$|E
500|$|In doing {{research}} for her proposed novel Show Boat, writer Edna Ferber spent several {{weeks on the}} James Adams Floating Palace Theatre in Bath, North Carolina, gathering material about a disappearing American entertainment venue, the river showboat. In a few weeks, she gained <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>called</b> a [...] "treasure trove of show-boat material, human, touching, true". Jerome Kern {{was impressed by the}} novel and, hoping to adapt it as a musical, asked the critic Alexander Woollcott to introduce him to Ferber in October 1926. Woollcott introduced them that evening during the intermission of Kern's latest musical, Criss Cross.|$|E

500|$|British author Georgette Heyer {{essentially}} {{invented the}} Regency romance in 1935 {{with the publication}} of Regency Buck, and her early Regencies were quite successful. In 1950 she began to work on <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>called</b> [...] "the magnum opus of my latter years", a medieval trilogy intended to cover the House of Lancaster between 1393 and 1435. To earn income, she periodically interrupted her research to write additional Regency romances; Lady of Quality, published in 1972, was the last of them, and the last of her novels to be published during her lifetime. Heyer suffered a stroke in July 1973 and was in ill health until her death the following year.|$|E
500|$|While {{running the}} shop, David wrote another {{full-length}} book, Spices, Salt and Aromatics in the English Kitchen (1970). It {{was her first}} book in a decade and {{the first of a}} projected series on English cookery to be called [...] "English Cooking, Ancient and Modern". She had decided to concentrate on the subject while recuperating from her cerebral haemorrhage in 1963. The book was a departure from her earlier works and contained more food history about <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>called</b> [...] "the English preoccupation with the spices and the scents, the fruit, the flavourings, the sources and the condiments of the orient, near and far".|$|E
500|$|Dareka no Manazashi was {{positively}} received in Japan, and attracted particular interest once available on YouTube. Megumi Sawai of RocketNews24 quoted <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>called</b> typical online {{comments on the}} film, all of which described the emotional impact it had: [...] "It was very good, and deeply emotional." [...] "Hopelessly, I was reduced to tears." [...] Sawai herself credited the film for the high quality of the art, and its message, saying {{it reminded her of}} the [...] "bonds between family members, which remain unchanged even as the form of a family changes". ASCII.jp said that [...] "even young viewers can be moved by sympathy" [...] after watching it, but that its greatest emotional impact might be for older audiences.|$|E

United States State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said that the US was [...] "very concerned by recent violence surrounding protests" [...] of the 14th and 15th. In a 15 February appeal, Amnesty International called the Bahraini authorities to stop using what it called [...] "excessive force" [...] against protesters, to put all security forces' members who had used excessive force on trial and [...] "to respect and protect the right of freedom expression, movement and assembly in Bahrain".|$|E
500|$|Georgette Heyer is {{best known}} for writing romantic stories set in the Regency era, but her body of work {{encompassed}} many different historical periods, including the English Civil War and the Middle Ages. One of her favoured periods centred on the House of Lancaster's peak of power, between 1393 and 1435. In 1950, Heyer began working on <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>called</b> [...] "the magnum opus of my latter years", a medieval trilogy intended to cover the House of Lancaster during that period. She estimated that she would need five years to complete this project. Her impatient readers continually clamoured for new books, however; to satisfy them and her tax liabilities, Heyer interrupted herself to write Regency romances, such as April Lady (1957) and Charity Girl (1970).|$|E
