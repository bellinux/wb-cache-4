Some critics find that these poets share some formal traits (including an {{interest}} in traditional poetic forms) {{as well as a}} willingness to engage with the difficult political situation in Northern Ireland. Others (such as the Dublin poet Thomas Kinsella) have found the <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a Northern school to be more hype than reality, though this view is not widely held.|$|E
25|$|Episode 32 of MythBusters {{investigates the}} urban legend of an {{affordable}} jet pack or rocket pack {{that can be}} built from plans purchased on the Internet. Extensive modifications {{were made by the}} MythBusters team due to vagueness in the plans and because of the infeasibility of the specified engine mounting system. The jet pack produced by the MythBusters had two ducted fans powered by ultralight-type piston engines. (Fans complained that the use of piston engines destroyed the <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the pack's being truly based on jets, by which, presumably, they meant self-contained gas turbines.) They found it was not powerful enough to lift a person off the ground, and was expensive to build. The plans specified a Rotax 503 ultralight engine, but they intended to use the more powerful and lighter Rotax 583 engine before a similar lighter unnamed engine was substituted.|$|E
25|$|When her great-uncle's sole heir, Sarah Lockwood Winchester, {{the widow}} of his son William Wirt Winchester, died in September 1922, part of the multi-million dollar estate was left to Olive Winchester. Additionally, Winchester was the {{beneficiary}} of 25% of a substantial estate of her maternal great uncle, Levi Merrick Stewart (born December 10, 1827 in Corinna, Maine; died May 3, 1910 in Minneapolis, Minnesota). Following these inheritances, in 1922 Winchester provided the funds to build a home for Wiley at Northwest Nazarene College. According to Ingersol, Throughout her tenure at Northwest Nazarene, Winchester taught her specialties: Biblical language and literature. But she also grew interested in the <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> religious education in the local church, and at Northwest Nazarene she developed and taught the initial courses in religious education. She spurred further interest in that emerging discipline by contributing frequent articles on religious education to church papers and curriculum resource manuals.|$|E

She explained in an interview, [...] "This <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the perfect {{woman of the}} ‘50s is what the title song is about... There was no possibility of being something different, and that, in turn, created a prototype {{of a woman who}} was mediocre." ...|$|E

Joyce called a Flecktones show a [...] "musical free-for-all, embracing the band's recorded material and venturing off into the great unknown the next."

500|$|Over the years, Barbree {{has stated}} that he has stayed away from sensationalizing the space program, or those {{associated}} with it, and commented {{that he would not}} put some items that could be considered harmful into his newest book, stating [...] "The <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the book is not to hurt somebody." [...] Barbree attempts to illustrate this in his memoir by telling of a private investigator who approached him with an audio tape which allegedly contained proof of an extramarital affair involving an astronaut.

5000|$|I {{was quite}} {{surprised}} when {{management and the}} record company wanted me to make an album. I thought it was quite daunting. There {{were a couple of}} tunes I liked - 'Suzannah's Still Alive,' 'Lincoln County' - but it had to feel right, and it didn't feel right. I did a few songs in a demo studio and I knocked out three or four songs, {{and one of them was}} 'Creeping Jean,' and I started to get very depressed about the <b>whole</b> <b>idea.</b> One <b>of</b> the last songs I recorded then was 'I'm Crying,' so you can tell what frame of mind I was in.|$|R

We are strongly persuaded that, {{in order to have}} a better understanding of the behaviour of the economy as a <b>whole,</b> the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> capitalism as a self-sustained balanced system should be abandoned. This work addresses two main tasks. First, it attempts to retrace the seminal contributions on endogenous business cycle theory, devoting particular attention to Keynesian and Classical/Marxian models. Second, we develop a model able to encompass, at the same time, Keynesian and Marxian drivers of fluctuations. What we obtain is an important interpretive puzzle...|$|R
500|$|Schwab {{comments}} in a 2004 interview regarding the number 86 {{in the band}} name: [...] "The generation before us used that phrase to describe when they would reject or remove something...Project 86 is like the <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> being rejected, or separate, or not going along with the current." [...] The group did not travel much initially; they decided to hone their sound and live performances before embarking on tours. In 1997, Project 86 was voted {{one of the top}} independent acts of the year by HM magazine readers. At Tomfest the same year, their performance was a big hit and Tooth & Nail Records, became interested and subsequently signed them.|$|E
500|$|EastEnders: E20 was {{conceived}} by executive producer Diederick Santer {{as part of}} EastEnders 25th anniversary celebrations. Described as the [...] "naughty little brother or sister to the main show", it was devised {{in a bid to}} target younger viewers and to develop and nurture new talent. Executive producer John Yorke, who oversaw the show, and is also controller of BBC drama production and new talent, said [...] "Fundamentally the <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the show is it's a training ground for new talent, be that acting, writing, composing, remixing, everything. The fact is because it's online, we can take risks." [...] Nevertheless, the makers said they knew they had to get it right because [...] "the eyes of the World Wide Web would be watching." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{they began}} working on the song, Carey began to {{incorporate}} other lyrics into the chorus, {{trying to make the}} song relatable to the AIDS epidemic that was in full force in the mid-1990s. Additionally, Mariah's sister Alison Carey had been diagnosed with HIV in 1988 when she was 27, an event that ruined their relationship and tore them apart. Carey has stated that she wrote the song hoping that all her fans that have lost someone could relate to [...] "One Sweet Day" [...] and maybe help ease the pain of the loss. Carey described the song as [...] " [...] <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> when you lose people that are close to you, it changes your life and changes our perspective." ...|$|E

30|$|The NRED {{algorithm}} provides fairness {{based on}} the estimated size of a distributed queue. Its performance is mainly dependent on two parameters; the time interval Tinterval, {{and the weight of}} the queue Wq. Proper selection of these two parameters is key to the success of NRED. On the <b>whole,</b> the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> QE & FF is quiet promising, and simulation results show that the FF mechanism can improve the throughput of UDP, but also that there is high variance in the round trip time (RTT) of TCP with the FF mechanism. Thus, TCP fails to perform better due to this high variance in RTT.|$|R
500|$|Commerce Square {{was praised}} for its design of two towers {{surrounding}} a plaza. The Philadelphia Inquirer said [...] "Its most positive aspect {{is that it}} avoids the developers' cliches of atriums and shopping malls and makes a real urban place. It expresses great confidence in Philadelphia, and even more important, in the <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> living in cities." [...] Renowned Philadelphia urban planner Edmund N. Bacon praised Commerce Square and its plaza by saying [...] " [...] sensitivity for urban design is beautifully demonstrated by his design for the lobby level, including the splendid garden, of Commerce Square at 20th and Market streets, which I think {{will prove to be}} one of the finest commercial projects to be built in this century." ...|$|E
500|$|The band's third album, Fables of the Reconstruction (1985), {{demonstrated}} {{a change in}} direction. Instead of Dixon and Easter, R.E.M. chose producer Joe Boyd, {{who had worked with}} Fairport Convention and Nick Drake, to record the album in England. The band members found the sessions unexpectedly difficult, and were miserable due to the cold winter weather and what they considered to be poor food; the situation brought the band to the verge of break-up. The gloominess surrounding the sessions ended up providing the context for the album itself. Lyrically, Stipe began to create storylines in the mode of Southern mythology, noting in a 1985 interview that he was inspired by [...] "the <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the old men sitting around the fire, passing on...legends and fables to the grandchildren".|$|E
500|$|Millard also noted, [...] "Not a lot {{of songs}} mention the {{foundation}} of what we believe in. The whole idea that Christ was born of a virgin, he died on the cross, he rose again. Just {{the basic principles of}} Christianity". He also commented that [...] "the song kind of takes us there, I say 'kind of' because the first line used to be talking about until a child was born, but it was instantly a Christmas song... but it does, the first verse goes through talking about how we were completely separated until the cross, basically." [...] Regarding the chorus of the song, Millard said [...] "the <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the chorus and the sense that it brings in, with the tons of voices singing, is the fact that there's a day thats going to come when we are going to worship and be as one." ...|$|E
40|$|Team {{creation}} {{is a process}} of continually solving creative problems. It is a complicated process in which team members need to generate and implement idea until creative task is complicated. Now a great deal of research focuses on how to stimulate team members to generate more ideas. Very little research is about how to manage the <b>whole</b> process <b>of</b> <b>idea.</b> In order to support team creation, we design an idea management system (IMS) which can manage the <b>whole</b> process <b>of</b> <b>idea.</b> IMS has three main functions which are creative idea recognition, idea selection and idea evolution and visualization. C reative idea recognition is to recognize whether an idea is creative and valuable or not using latent semantic analysis; idea selection is to select the m ost appropriate idea stage by stage; idea evolution and visualization is to realize visualization <b>of</b> <b>idea</b> evolution process based on our idea evolution model. </p...|$|R

500|$|Lillywhite {{believed}} that the African influences had not translated well onto the album, remarking: [...] "It's a pity because the <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> Morocco as a big idea was great. When the big idea for U2 is good, that is when they succeed the most, but I don't think the spirit of what {{they set out to}} achieve was translated. Something happened that meant it did not come across on the record." [...] The Edge concurred, admitting that the group erred by [...] "starting out experimental and then trying to bring it into something that was more accessible". He added, [...] "I think probably we should have said, 'It's an experimental work. That's what it is.'"

500|$|... "Nobody's Off the Hook" [...] {{is written}} about the singer-songwriter Teddy Thompson, a {{longtime}} friend of Wainwright's. Citing Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, and Mahler as influences, Wainwright stated the string arrangements were his first attempt at writing chamber music. [...] "Between My Legs", which Wainwright wrote about a [...] "boy [...] was infatuated with named Tommy Hotpants", is a [...] "fantasy about being able to save your object of desire when the apocalypse comes, and bring him to some sort of hidden paradise." [...] The last 30 seconds of the song contains the opening notes of the title song from Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical The Phantom of the Opera, along with a dramatic spoken word part by Siân Phillips. According to Wainwright, [...] "Rules and Regulations" [...] was originally written as a slow ballad for Robert Wilson, and is about the perspective of [...] "someone who looks at athletes, but who is not an athlete". [...] "Not Ready to Love" [...] is Wainwright's [...] "surrender to the <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> being loved and being able to maintain a relationship." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2004, [...] "Bangla Desh" [...] {{was played}} {{during the final}} episode of the BBC {{television}} series Himalaya with Michael Palin, in which Palin travels south from Bhutan to Bay of Bengal and reflects on Bangladesh's struggle for independence. Writing for Blender magazine in April that year, Paul Du Noyer described the song as a [...] "fine 1971 single". In the 2005 [...] "Beatles Solo" [...] edition of NME Originals, Adrian Thrills rated [...] "Bangla Desh" [...] second among Harrison's [...] "ten solo gems" [...] (behind [...] "What Is Life"), referring {{to it as a}} [...] "jazz-blues-rock shuffle" [...] that [...] "set the template for Band Aid". Writing in The Cambridge Companion to the Beatles in 2009, Michael Frontani said that with his Bangladesh relief effort, Harrison [...] "pioneered the <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the charity album and single, {{as well as of the}} rock concert fundraiser".

50|$|Organic {{architecture}} is also translated into the all inclusive nature of Frank Lloyd Wright's design process. Materials, motifs, and basic ordering principles continue to repeat themselves throughout {{the building as}} a <b>whole.</b> The <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> organic architecture refers {{not only to the}} buildings' literal relationship to the natural surroundings, but how the buildings' design is carefully thought about {{as if it were a}} unified organism. Geometries throughout Wright's buildings build a central mood and theme. Essentially organic {{architecture is}} also the literal design of every element of a building: From the windows, to the floors, to the individual chairs intended to fill the space.
