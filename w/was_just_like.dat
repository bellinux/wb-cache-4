5|$|At {{the end of}} the day, man, I'm just tired, and old, and bald, and fat, and grouchy, and bored. You know? So I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>like,</b> I'm {{going to}} make this record, and do this stupid Ozzfest thing, and tell a bunch of stupid jokes in front {{of a lot of people}} at Download, then I'm just going to fuck off for a while. The bigger this gets, the less I care, to the point where I just need to go spend some time with my family. I don't wanna bastardise Strapping and all these other {{projects}} by doing it for the money. Strapping was about the big middle finger, and it still is, but I don't think it needs to go any further than this.|$|E

You have to turn this into music. You have to try, at least. I was so embarrassed by just everything. I just didn’t {{want to be that}} person that just went down after all of that. A lot of the time in the sessions, they weren’t letting me write. They were giving me tracks and doing it all. I was like, Why am I here? Then I got the perfect {{combination}} of people to really support me and make me feel confident. It was an amazing awakening. I walked into the session and I was like, You gotta know, I don’t care about anything except the truth right here.|$|E

In addition, she cannot return to work until she is done with her training. Liz, however, cannot handle life without work, as she needs the stress. Her attitude changes when she meets one of her neighbors, Emily (Elizabeth Marvel). She understands how Liz feels because she <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> Liz and tells her there are better ways to live. Liz hangs out with Emily and her friends (Mary Catherine Garrison, Kerry Butler, and Christina Gausas), who spend majority of their time getting spa treatments and going shopping. Liz gets {{so caught up in}} their lifestyle that she forgets to watch her show, The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS). Not wanting to come back to work—as she is intrigued by her new friends' lifestyle—Liz sexually harasses her counselor, Jeffrey Weinerslav (Todd Buonopane). She goes back to hanging out with Emily and her friends, but soon discovers that they are a Girl Fight Club, which disappoints Liz. In order for her to get out, Liz needs to fight them.|$|E

Lugnvik was incorporated into the city in 1954 and Östersund <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> the rest of Jämtland affected by the Rehn-Meidner-model, though {{not in the same}} way. The Swedish Keynesian politic was launched in order to improve the mobility of the labour force. Jämtland was struck hard by this when the people moved from the countryside to cities, from inland to coast and from the north to the south. As an urban area Östersund was affected by the Million Programme and urban districts like Körfältet were created.|$|E
