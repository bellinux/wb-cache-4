In {{addition}} to eventually releasing his own albums on the label, he initially used {{the company as}} an avenue for collaboration with other musicians. He wanted Dark Horse {{to serve as a}} creative outlet for artists, as Apple Records had for the Beatles. Harrison explained: [...] "Most of the stuff <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> I produce". Eric Idle commented: [...] "He's extremely generous, and he backs and supports all sorts of people that you'll never, ever hear of." [...] The first acts signed to the new label were Ravi Shankar and Splinter, whose album Harrison produced, which provided Dark Horse with their first hit, [...] "Costafine Town". Other artists signed by Dark Horse include Attitudes, Henry McCullough, Jiva, and Stairsteps.|$|E

On March 1, at the Spartanburg, South Carolina poll, Hunter {{finished}} a close third in a statistical tie with McCain and Giuliani. The showing impressed Spartanburg Republican Gerald Emory who referred to Hunter as, [...] "a true Ronald Reagan conservative that we can support." [...] The following month he won the Anderson County, South Carolina straw poll and tied for second place in both the Greenwood County and Pickens County straw polls. Hunter thanked the counties for their support, which he claimed provided [...] "a huge boost." [...] He added, [...] "t is clear our message of maintaining a strong national defense, securing our border without amnesty, holding China accountable on trade, and protecting life are resonating with the voters. Our campaign is one of issues, not flash and expense. We don't have a jet or an army of consultants and paid staff. We do have the conservative message that is true. In the end, that <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> Americans want." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{his time}} with TSR, Gygax had often {{mentioned}} the mysterious Castle Greyhawk which formed the centre of his own home campaign. But despite all of his written output over the previous 30 years, Gygax had never published details of the castle. In 2003, Gygax {{announced that he was}} again partnering with Rob Kuntz to publish the original and previously unpublished details of Castle Greyhawk and the City of Greyhawk in 6 volumes, although the project would use the rules for Castles and Crusades rather than D. As Gygax wrote in an on-line forum: [...] "I have laid out a new schematic of castle and dungeon levels based on both my original design of 13 levels plus side adjuncts, and the 'New Greyhawk Castle' that resulted when Rob and I combined our efforts and added a lot of new levels too. From that Rob will draft the level plans for the newest version of the work. Meantime, I am collecting all the most salient feature, encounters, tricks, traps, etc. for inclusion on the various levels. So the end result <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> is essentially the best of our old work in a coherent presentation usable by all DMs, the material having all the known and yet to be discussed features of the original work that are outstanding... I hope." [...] Since Wizards of the Coast, which had bought TSR in 1997, still owned the rights to the name [...] "Greyhawk", Gygax changed the name of Castle Greyhawk to [...] "Castle Zagyg", a reverse homophone of his own name, and also changed the name of the nearby city to [...] "Yggsburgh", a play on his initials [...] "E.G.G." ...|$|E
500|$|Safran {{called the}} second season more cohesive, {{mirroring}} the first season and [...] "... keep the two-storyline structure". In an interview, he confirmed that the structure would be [...] "a little bit of flash-forward, but the majority <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> I like to call the present". According to Safran, the producers aimed at a more-mature, darker second season which would be [...] "less confusing" [...] to viewers. Safran had plotted an upcoming plot point as the first season ended, which saw Alex clearing her name, getting fired by the FBI and receiving a job offer by the CIA director. He revealed that the season-two storyline would focus on the contrasting work ethics of the FBI and the CIA. Safran elaborated {{about the differences between}} the FBI and CIA, saying: [...] "We're very interested {{in the fact that the}} FBI's so much about being honest, truthful and living up to your badge. And the CIA is the opposite. You succeed if you can deceive. So it's going to be interesting to see. It's like a funhouse mirror of what we've seen". He announced that the series would switch to a single timeline after the fourteenth episode. Safran said that {{the second season}} always intended to adopt a single timeline after the resolved storyline and the aftermath of the hostage crisis, adding [...] "When we broke Season 2, we knew we were going to go to one timeline, because it’s about the [...] event, and then it’s about what happens after the event. And you can’t flashback to the Farm after the crisis is over". He said that the change was also due to viewer complaints that the first season's dual timeline was confusing.|$|E

Consider a paraboloid subject to two line constraints that intersect at a single point. As the only feasible solution, this point is obviously a constrained extremum.

2500|$|The {{introduction}} of the GIDC diagnosis into the DSM-III in 1980 was preceded by numerous US studies and treatments on feminine boys beginning {{as early as the}} 1950s and 1960s, most prominently by John Money and Richard Green at the Johns Hopkins Hospital and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The prevention of transsexuality and / or homosexuality was explicitly stated as the goal of many of these studies: [...] "My focus <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> we might consider the prevention of transsexualism." [...] Bryant notes that feminine boys were not a new phenomenon at this time; however, the public emergence of adult transsexual women (male to female) in the 1950s was new and created a number of problems for psychologists, motivating some to undertake efforts at preventing their further emergence. Meyerowitz chronicles the deep disagreements which erupted between psychologists and physicians after Christine Jorgensen's public gender transition, namely over whether transsexuals should be permitted to align their bodies with their inner identities or whether their inner identities must be brought in line with their bodies. At the time, transsexual women were beginning to publish first-person narratives which highlighted their awareness of their femininity at a young age and Bryant notes that some clinicians and researchers thus turned their attention to feminine boys, constructing sissies as a new [...] "medicalized patient and research population." ...|$|E
2500|$|John S. Carlile of transmontane Alleghany County, like Willey an Unconditional Unionist, {{stressed}} that western Virginians {{were committed to}} slavery as “essential to American liberty.” But he would not run away from devotion to the Union. “This government that we {{are called upon to}} destroy has never brought us anything but good. No injury has it ever inflicted on us. No act has every been put upon the statute book of our common country, interfering with the institution of slavery in any shape, manner or form, that was not put there by and with the consent of the slave-holding States of this Union…” If Virginia joined the Confederacy, the North would no longer be bound by the Constitution to stand by slavery and slave-holding states, and it would join with England, France and Spain to extinguish slavery everywhere. Thomas Jefferson's grandson, George Wythe Randolph, now a Richmond lawyer, made a secessionist speech, observing that although the Republicans had captured the United States Government “in strict accordance with Constitutional forms”, it was merely sectional. “The Government, then…is constitutionally revolutionized, and requires a counter-revolution to restore it.” But “Let [...] go with us into a Southern Confederacy, and receive protection from Northern industry, and they <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> they ought to be—the manufacturers and miners of a great [...] nation.” We should go into the Confederacy, “we are told it will bring war.

God called to Moses from the bush, and Moses answered: [...] "Here I am." [...] God told Moses not to draw near, and to take off his shoes, for the place on which he stood was holy ground. God identified as the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, reported having seen the Israelites' affliction and heard their cry, and promised to deliver them from Egypt to Canaan, a land flowing with milk and honey. God told Moses that God was sending Moses to Pharaoh to bring the Israelites out of Egypt, but Moses asked who he was that he should do so. God told Moses that God would be with him, and after he brought them out of Egypt, he would serve God on that mountain. Moses asked God whom he should say sent him to the Israelites, and God said [...] "I <b>Will</b> <b>Be</b> <b>What</b> I Will Be" [...] ( [...] , Ehyeh-Asher-Ehyeh), and told Moses to tell the Israelites that [...] "I Will Be" [...] ( [...] , Ehyeh) sent him.
