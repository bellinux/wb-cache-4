25|$|It {{has been}} shown that <b>a</b> cuff <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> bladder occludes blood flow at a lower {{pressure}} level than <b>a</b> cuff <b>with</b> <b>a</b> narrower bladder.

Lower pressures, and associated lower pressure gradients, may reduce the risk of pressure-related injuries to the patient. Furthermore, Estebe et. al demonstrated that <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> tourniquet cuff is less painful than a narrow cuff if inflated at lower pressures and at these lower pressures it is still effective at occluding blood flow.|$|R
