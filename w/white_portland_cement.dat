25|$|<b>White</b> <b>Portland</b> <b>cement</b> {{or white}} {{ordinary}} Portland cement (WOPC) {{is similar to}} ordinary, grey, Portland cement in all respects, except for its high degree of whiteness. Obtaining this colour requires high purity raw materials (low Fe2O3 content), and some modification to the method of manufacture, a.o. a higher kiln temperature required to sinter the clinker {{in the absence of}} ferric oxides acting as a flux in normal clinker. As Fe2O3 contributes to decrease the melting point of the clinker (normally 1450°C), the white cement requires a higher sintering temperature (around 1600°C). Because of this, it is somewhat more expensive than the grey product. The main requirement is to have a low iron content which should be less than 0.5wt.% expressed as Fe2O3 for white cement, and less than 0.9wt.% for off-white cement. It also helps to have the iron oxide as ferrous oxide (FeO) which is obtained via slightly reducing conditions in the kiln, i.e., operating with zero excess oxygen at the kiln exit. This gives the clinker and cement a green tinge. Other metallic oxides such as Cr2O3 (green), MnO (pink), TiO2 (white), etc., in trace content, can also give colour tinges, so for a given project it is best to use cement from a single batch.|$|E

40|$|Background and Aim: Furcal {{perforation}} has a {{great impact}} on prognosis of endodontic treatments, requiring immediate and proper intervention. Gray MTA is applied as material of choice in repairing perforations. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the repair of mechanical furcal perforations, histologically using <b>white</b> MTA and <b>Portland</b> <b>cement</b> and compare them with gray MTA. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, second to fourth mandibular and maxillary premolar teeth of five dogs received endodontic treatment, then the furcation area of the teeth were perforated and repaired as follow: gray MTA in group 1, white MTA in group 2, <b>Portland</b> <b>cement</b> in group 3 and cotton pellet in group 4 (control). Animals were controlled for 4 months and sacrificed using an over dosage of sodium thiopental intravenous injection and perfusion of 10 % formaldehyde. Chi-square and Fisher exact tests were used to compare hard tissue formation between groups and between each two groups, respectively. Non-parametric Kruskall Wallis and Dunn procedure were also used to compare degree of inflammation among groups and between each two groups, respectively. Results: Gray MTA had more favorable results (90. 9 % hard tissue formation and only 9. 1 % severe inflammation) but the difference between gray MTA, <b>white</b> MTA and <b>Portland</b> <b>cement</b> was not statistically significant. Conclusion: The difference between gray MTA, <b>white</b> MTA and <b>Portland</b> <b>cement</b> groups was not statistically significant for degree of inflammation and hard tissue formation. In conclusion both <b>white</b> MTA and <b>Portland</b> <b>cement</b> can be used instead of gray MTA to repair perforations in accordance to esthetic considerations...|$|R

2500|$|Portland cement is {{the most}} common type of cement in general use around the world as a basic {{ingredient}} of concrete, mortar, stucco, and non-specialty grout. It was developed from other types of hydraulic lime in England in the mid 19th century, and usually originates from limestone. It is a fine powder, produced by heating limestone and clay minerals in a kiln to form clinker, grinding the clinker, and adding small amounts of other materials. [...] Several types of Portland cement are available. The most common, called ordinary Portland cement (OPC), is grey in colour, but <b>white</b> <b>Portland</b> <b>cement</b> is also available.

The interaction of osteoblasts with filling materials is critical in healing of surgical lesions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the morphology and adhesion of human osteoblasts (MG- 63 cell line) in contact with IRM, gray MTA, <b>white</b> MTA and <b>Portland</b> <b>cement</b> (PC) as root end filling materials. Materials and Methods: In this in vitro study, human osteoblasts of osteosarcoma were provided from the cell bank of Iran Pasteur Institute, and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium. Test materials were mixed according to the manufacturer's instructions and placed in contact with osteoblast cells. After the first, third and seventh days discs of materials with grown cells were fixed and examined by scanning electron microscopy. Results: Results showed that after 7 days most of the osteoblasts were attached to the surface of both gray and white MTA and PC and appeared flat or round, however cells adjacent to IRM were round without any adhesion and spread. Conclusion: Based on the results of this study, human osteoblasts have a favorable response to gray and <b>white</b> MTA and <b>Portland</b> <b>cement</b> compared to IRM...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the antimicrobial activity of different root-end filling materials - Sealer 26, Sealapex with zinc oxide, zinc oxide and eugenol, <b>white</b> and gray <b>Portland</b> <b>cement,</b> <b>white</b> and gray MTA-Angelus, and gray Pro Root MTA - against six different microorganism strains. The agar diffusion method was used. A base layer was made using Müller-Hinton agar (MH) and wells were formed by removing the agar. The materials were placed in the wells immediately after manipulation. The microorganisms used were: Micrococcus luteus (ATCC 9341), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538), Escherichia coli (ATCC 10538), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Candida albicans (ATCC 10231), and Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 10541). The plates were kept at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion and then incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. Triphenyltetrazolium chloride 0. 05 % gel was added for optimization, and the zones of inhibition were measured. Data were subjected to the Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn tests at a 5 % significance level. The results showed that all materials had antimicrobial activity against all the tested strains. Analysis of the efficacy of the materials against the microbial strains showed that Sealapex with zinc oxide, zinc oxide and eugenol and Sealer 26 created larger inhibition halos than the MTA-based and <b>Portland</b> <b>cements</b> (P < 0. 05). On the basis of the methodology used, it may be concluded that all endodontic sealers, MTA-based and <b>Portland</b> <b>cements</b> evaluated in this study possess antimicrobial activity, particularly the endodontic sealers...|$|R
40|$|This study {{compared}} {{the resistance of}} Triclinic-C 3 S, grey (OPC) and <b>white</b> (WOPC) <b>Portland</b> <b>cement</b> paste to decalcification induced by accelerated leaching in concentrated ammonium nitrate solutions. Paste microstructure was studied with scanning and backscattering electron microscopy (SEM and BSEM) and nitrogen BET surface area techniques. Ca 2 + leached content was quantified by ICP, XRD and FTIR techniques were used to study phase mineralogy. The conclusions drawn from the findings were that calcium leaching-induced decay in the cementitious materials studied (C 3 S, OPC and WOPC), accelerated by immersion in ammonium nitrate, affected the main calcium phases in the samples (CH, C–S–H gel and ettringite), i. e., both the anhydrous and the hydrated phases. The present study showed that the Ca/Si ratio of C–S–H gels declines on a gradient from the sample core outward. Specimen surface area and nanoporosity rose in cementitious materials after Ca leaching-induced decay and subsequently declined {{as a result of}} the collapse of the structure of the hydrated cement, and in particular of the C–S–H gel. C 3 S paste was impacted more quickly and intensely by leaching than the WOPC and OPC pastes.

50|$|<b>White</b> <b>Portland</b> <b>cement</b> {{is used in}} {{combination}} with white aggregates to produce white concrete for prestige construction projects and decorative work. White concrete usually {{takes the form of}} pre-cast cladding panels, since it is not economical to use white cement for structural purposes. <b>White</b> <b>Portland</b> <b>cement</b> is also used {{in combination}} with inorganic pigments to produce brightly colored concretes and mortars. Ordinary cement, when used with pigments, produces colors that may be attractive, but are somewhat dull. With white cement, bright reds, yellows and greens can be readily produced. Blue concrete can also be made, at some expense. The pigments may be added at the concrete mixer. Alternatively, to guarantee repeatable color, some manufacturers supply ready-blended colored cements, using white cement as a base. The whiteness of WOPC is measured as the powdered material having a reflectance value ("L value") in excess of 85%. A particular success in the use of WOPC and added pigments is monocouche renders.|$|E

5000|$|<b>White</b> <b>Portland</b> <b>cement</b> differs {{physically}} from gray cement only {{in terms}} of its color. Its setting behavior and strength development are essentially the same as that expected in gray cement, and it meets standard specifications such as ASTM C 150 and EN 197. In practice, because much white cement is used in pre-cast concrete products, it is commonly made to a high-early strength specification such as ASTM C 150 Type III. This aids concrete manufacturers' production rate. Higher potential strength also helps to counteract the strength-diminishing effects of pigment addition. In addition to the usual specifications, manufacturers guarantee the whiteness of the product, typically in terms of a reflectance measurement, such as L*a*b L-value, or tristimulus. In the latter case, because off-color white cement tends to be greenish, the Tri-Y (green) value is used.
