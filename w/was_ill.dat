5|$|According to {{the retired}} senior U.S. {{intelligence}} official speaking to Hersh, bin Laden <b>was</b> <b>ill</b> at this point, financially supported by some within Saudi Arabia, and {{kept by the}} ISI to better manage their complex relationship with Pakistani and Afghan Islamist groups. According to the official, retired CIA officials {{emphasized the importance of}} bin Laden's courier to the press, because they were nervous over torture scrutiny and possible prosecution.|$|E
5|$|Boycott's {{regiment}} {{transferred to}} Belfast {{shortly after his}} arrival. Six months later, it was sent to Newry before marching to Dublin, where it remained for a year. In 1852, Boycott married Anne Dunne in StPaul's Church, Arran Quay, Dublin. He <b>was</b> <b>ill</b> between August 1851 and February 1852 and sold his commission the following year, but decided to remain in Ireland. He leased a farm in County Tipperary, where he acted as a landlord on a small scale.|$|E

5|$|In February 1779, Lafayette reached Paris. For disobeying {{the king}} {{by going to}} America, he was placed under house arrest for eight days. This was merely face-saving by Louis XVI; Lafayette was given a hero's welcome and was soon invited to hunt with the king. As the American envoy <b>was</b> <b>ill,</b> Benjamin Franklin's {{grandson}} presented Lafayette with the gold-encrusted sword commissioned by the Continental Congress.|$|E
5|$|Personal {{problems}} {{continued to}} multiply. By 1925, Carin's mother <b>was</b> <b>ill.</b> The Görings—with difficulty—raised {{the money in}} the spring of 1925 for a journey to Sweden via Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Danzig (now Gdańsk). Göring had become a violent morphine addict; Carin's family were shocked by his deterioration. Carin, who <b>was</b> <b>ill</b> with epilepsy and a weak heart, had to allow the doctors to take charge of Göring; her son was taken by his father. Göring was certified a dangerous drug addict and was placed in Långbro asylum on 1 September 1925. He was violent {{to the point where he}} had to be confined to a straitjacket, but his psychiatrist felt he was sane; the condition was caused solely by the morphine. Weaned off the drug, he left the facility briefly, but had to return for further treatment. He returned to Germany when an amnesty was declared in 1927 and resumed working in the aircraft industry. Hitler, who had written Mein Kampf while in prison, had been released in December 1924. Carin Göring, ill with epilepsy and tuberculosis, died of heart failure on 17 October 1931.|$|E
5|$|Potter {{continued}} to publish children's books with Warnes and used her sales profits {{and a small}} legacy from an aunt to buy Hill Top, a working farm of 34 acres (13.85ha) in the Lake District in July 1905. On 25 August, Potter's fiancé and editor Norman Warne died suddenly; she became very depressed and <b>was</b> <b>ill</b> for many weeks, but rallied to complete the last few tales she had planned or discussed with him.|$|E

Following Wangenheim's death in 1915, Count von Wolff-Metternich was designated his successor. He had little contact with the expedition.|$|E
5|$|The Chief Constructor, Sir Edward Reed, <b>was</b> <b>ill</b> so {{the design}} of this ship was {{entrusted}} to his assistant and brother-in-law, Nathaniel Barnaby, himself a future Chief Constructor. For reasons that have not survived, the Admiralty required that Penelope to be a ship of unusually shallow draught, possibly {{in light of the}} operations in the shallow Baltic Sea during the Crimean War of 1854–55.|$|E

5|$|After {{teaching}} at the University of Washington from 1910 to 1912, Morgan completed a Ph.D. in chemistry at the University of Chicago in 1914. Stieglitz supervised her dissertation. She {{may have been the}} only married woman to have received a Ph.D. in chemistry in {{the first few years of}} the 20th century. Despite the fact that married women were not generally welcome on university faculties (female professors were usually expected to resign when they married), Stieglitz agreed to write a recommendation letter for Morgan for a position at the University of Illinois. Stieglitz noted in his letter that the university should overlook Morgan's marital status because her husband <b>was</b> <b>ill</b> at the time.|$|E
5|$|After {{the battle}} of Quetzaltepeque, Villa Real was still short on food and Mazariegos <b>was</b> <b>ill.</b> He sent his brother to the capital of New Spain to ask for help, and then retreated to Copanaguastla against the protests of the town council, which was left to defend the fledgling colony. By now, Nuño de Guzmán was {{governor}} in Mexico, and he despatched Juan Enríquez de Guzmán to Chiapa as end-of-term judge over Mazariegos, and as alcalde mayor (a local colonial governor). He occupied his post for a year, during which time he attempted to reestablish Spanish control over the province, especially the northern and eastern regions, {{but was unable to}} make much headway.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the rebels}} were {{defeated}} in Surabaya, rebel forces campaigning {{in the interior}} of Central and East Java had more success. The rebel campaign culminated in the fall of the capital Plered in June 1677. The king <b>was</b> <b>ill,</b> and distrust among the royal princes prevented organized resistance. The king fled west with the crown prince and his retinue, allowing the rebels to enter and plunder the capital with little fighting. The rebels then withdrew to Kediri, taking the royal treasury with them.|$|E

5|$|Anne <b>was</b> <b>ill</b> for 15 {{months after}} the birth of her {{youngest}} son, Edgar. She bore Henrietta in 1669 and Catherine in 1671. Anne never recovered from Catherine's birth. Ill with breast cancer, she died on 31 March 1671. On her deathbed, her two brothers Henry and Laurence tried to bring an Anglican priest to give her communion, but Anne refused and she received viaticum of the Catholic Church. Two days after her death, her embalmed body was interred in the vault of Mary, Queen of Scots, at Westminster Abbey's Henry VII Chapel. In June 1671, Anne's only surviving son Edgar died of natural causes, followed by Catherine in December, leaving Mary and Anne as the Duke of York's heiresses.|$|E
5|$|As {{a member}} of the old Conservative {{government}} Cave left office on 23 January 1924. He was replaced by Lord Haldane, who was serving for a second time and was sworn in on 25 January. Haldane was in favour of the creation of a Ministry of Justice, and although Schuster was privately against it he suggested that he would have accepted the responsibilities of such a Ministry on the condition that it remained under his control as the Lord Chancellor's Office was. Haldane <b>was</b> <b>ill,</b> however, and the Labour government lasted only ten months thanks to the publishing of the Zinoviev Letter, and no large-scale reforms such as the creation of a Ministry of Justice were ever pushed through.|$|E
5|$|At {{least one}} Baron sat {{to hear a}} case, with {{convention}} insisting on a maximum of four Barons after the rule of Edward IV; as a mere convention, it was occasionally broken. When one Baron <b>was</b> <b>ill</b> or otherwise unable to sit it was felt appropriate to appoint a fifth, as in 1604 when Baron Sotherton <b>was</b> <b>ill,</b> and in 1708, when Baron Smith was called to Edinburgh to be a temporary Chief Baron of the Scottish Exchequer. In 1830 a fifth Baron was permanently added to relieve court congestion; at the same time, a fifth judge {{was added to the}} Court of Common Pleas and King's Bench. The First Baron was the Chief Baron of the Exchequer; if the Chancellor and Treasurer were unavailable, he {{was the head of the}} court. When he was also absent the Second Baron took charge, and so on; in one case in 1659, the Fourth Baron was the only judge available. The Second, Third and Fourth Barons were known as puisne Barons; initially treated as individual offices, after the time of James I the order was determined by the judges' seniority. Unlike in the Court of King's Bench, the different positions did not equate to different degrees of power; each Baron had an equal vote in decisions.|$|E

He denies that he <b>is</b> <b>ill,</b> but they take no notice, kill him, and have a feast. Exactly the same procedure is followed by a woman's closest female friends when it is a woman who <b>is</b> <b>ill.</b> They sacrifice and eat anyone who reaches old age, but it is unusual for anyone to do so, because they kill everyone who falls ill before reaching old age." ...|$|R

5|$|Because works {{critical}} of {{the leadership of the}} Chinese regime are considered sensitive, Gui always kept his work projects secret; he kept his movements to himself and his telephone calls were re-routed through foreign countries. He went a long period without entering China; he did not visit his father when the latter <b>was</b> <b>ill,</b> and did not return to China for his father's funeral. Media sources reported that Gui had published about half of the popular books written on Bo Xilai. When Bo was caught in the political fallout from the Wang Lijun incident in 2013, Gui reaped a financial benefit of HK$10million from the surge in book sales. Gui's publishing financed his property acquisitions in Hong Kong and Germany, including a seaside retreat in Pattaya, Thailand.|$|E
5|$|British Admiral George Brydges Rodney, who {{had been}} {{tracking}} de Grasse around the West Indies, was alerted to the latter's departure, but was uncertain of the French admiral's destination. Believing that de Grasse would return {{a portion of his}} fleet to Europe, Rodney detached Rear Admiral Sir Samuel Hood with 14 ships of the line and orders to find de Grasse's destination in North America. Rodney, who <b>was</b> <b>ill,</b> sailed for Europe {{with the rest of his}} fleet in order to recover, refit his fleet, and to avoid the Atlantic hurricane season.|$|E

This was the exact situation that had unfolded in the Worcestershire and MCC matches when Australia fielded their first-choice team; Harvey did not play and Brown batted out of position in the middle order. There was a chance of Harvey receiving a last-minute call-up when Barnes <b>was</b> <b>ill</b> with food poisoning in the week {{leading up to the}} Test, but the opener recovered.|$|E
