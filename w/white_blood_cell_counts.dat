25|$|Some leukemia {{patients}} {{do not have}} high <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>counts</b> visible during a regular blood count. This less-common condition is called aleukemia. The bone marrow still contains cancerous white blood cells which disrupt the normal production of blood cells, but they remain in the marrow instead of entering the bloodstream, {{where they would be}} visible in a blood test. For an aleukemic patient, the <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>counts</b> in the bloodstream can be normal or low. Aleukemia can occur in any of the four major types of leukemia, and is particularly common in hairy cell leukemia.|$|E

40|$|Background High <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>count</b> at {{presentation}} is an unfavorable prognostic factor for treatment outcome in intermediate cytogenetic risk acute myeloid leukemia. Since {{the impact of}} <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>count</b> on outcome of subgroups defined by the molecular markers NPMc(+) and FLT 3 -internal tandem duplication (ITD) is unknown, we addressed this issue. Design and Methods We studied the effect of <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>count</b> on outcome in a clinically and molecularly well-defined cohort of 525 patients with acute myeloid leukemia using these molecular markers. In addition, since an increased <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>count</b> {{has been associated with}} an increased FLT 3 -ITD/FLT 3 (wild-type) ratio, we investigated whether the effect of <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>count</b> on outcome could be explained by the FLT 3 -ITD/FLT 3 ratio. Results This analysis revealed that <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>count</b> had no impact on outcome in patients with the genotypic combinations 'NPMc(+) without FLT 3 -ITD' and 'NPM 1 wild-type with or without FLT 3 -ITD'. In contrast, <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>count</b> {{had a significant impact on}} complete remission rate (P= 0. 034), event-free survival (P= 0. 009) and overall survival (P Conclusions Our results demonstrate that both high <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>count</b> and FLT 3 -ITD/FLT 3 ratio are prognostic factors in patients with acute myeloid leukemia with the genotypic combination 'NPMc(+) with FLT 3 -ITD'...|$|R

25|$|Originally {{intended}} as a model planned community, Love Canal served as a residential area before being purchased by Hooker Chemical Company, now Occidental Chemical Corporation. After its sale to the local school district, Love Canal attracted national attention for the public health problem originated from the massive dumping of toxic waste on the grounds. This event displaced numerous families, leaving them with long-standing health issues and symptoms of high <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>counts</b> and leukemia. Consequently, the federal government passed the Superfund law. The resulting cleanup operation under the Superfund law demolished the neighborhood, wrapping up in 2004.|$|E
25|$|Blood {{tests in}} PNH show changes {{consistent}} with intravascular hemolytic anemia: low hemoglobin, raised lactate dehydrogenase, raised bilirubin (a breakdown product of hemoglobin), and decreased levels of haptoglobin; {{there can be}} raised reticulocytes (immature red cells released by the bone marrow to replace the destroyed cells) {{if there is no}} iron deficiency present. The direct antiglobulin test (DAT, or direct Coombs' test) is negative, as the hemolysis of PNH is not caused by antibodies. If the PNH occurs in the setting of known (or suspected) aplastic anemia, abnormal <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>counts</b> and decreased platelet counts may be seen at this. In this case, anemia may be caused by insufficient red blood cell production in addition to the hemolysis.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that mammalian species which invest in longer sleep times are investing in the immune system, as species with the longer sleep times have higher <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>counts.</b> Mammals born with well-developed regulatory systems, such as the horse and giraffe, tend to have less REM sleep than the species which are less developed at birth, such as cats and rats. This appears to echo the greater need for REM sleep among newborns than among adults in most mammal species. Many mammals sleep for a large proportion of each 24-hour period when they are very young. The giraffe only sleeps 2 hours a day in about 5–15 minute sessions. Koalas are the longest sleeping-mammals, about 20–22 hours a day. However, killer whales and some other dolphins do not sleep during the first month of life. Instead, young dolphins and whales frequently take rests by pressing their body next to their mother’s while she swims. As the mother swims she is keeping her offspring afloat to prevent them from drowning. This allows young dolphins and whales to rest, which will help keep their immune system healthy; in turn, protecting them from illnesses. During this period, mothers often sacrifice sleep for the protection of their young from predators. However, unlike other mammals, adult dolphins and whales are able to go without sleep for a month.|$|E
25|$|The {{first use}} of small-molecule drugs to treat cancer {{was in the early}} 20th century, {{although}} the specific chemicals first used were not originally intended for that purpose. Mustard gas was used as a chemical warfare agent during World War I and was discovered to be a potent suppressor of hematopoiesis (blood production). A similar family of compounds known as nitrogen mustards were studied further during World War II at the Yale School of Medicine. It was reasoned that an agent that damaged the rapidly growing white blood cells might have a similar effect on cancer. Therefore, in December 1942, several patients with advanced lymphomas (cancers of the lymphatic system and lymph nodes) were given the drug by vein, rather than by breathing the irritating gas. Their improvement, although temporary, was remarkable. Concurrently, during a military operation in World War II, following a German air raid on the Italian harbour of Bari, several hundred people were accidentally exposed to mustard gas, which had been transported there by the Allied forces to prepare for possible retaliation in the event of German use of chemical warfare. The survivors were later found to have very low <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>counts.</b> After WWII was over and the reports declassified, the experiences converged and led researchers to look for other substances that might have similar effects against cancer. The first chemotherapy drug to be developed from this line of research was mustine. Since then, many other drugs have been developed to treat cancer, and drug development has exploded into a multibillion-dollar industry, although the principles and limitations of chemotherapy discovered by the early researchers still apply.|$|E

2500|$|Anemia {{is common}} in {{children}} with SLE and develops in about 50% of cases. Low platelet and <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>counts</b> {{may be due to}} the disease or a side effect of pharmacological treatment. People with SLE may have an association with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (a thrombotic disorder), wherein autoantibodies to phospholipids are present in their serum. Abnormalities associated with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome include a paradoxical prolonged partial thromboplastin time (which usually occurs in hemorrhagic disorders) and a positive test for antiphospholipid antibodies; the combination of such findings have earned the term [...] "lupus anticoagulant-positive".

In a typical population, chromosomal damage affects 1% of people. Other studies were unable to find harm. The United States National Research Council (NRC) surveyed Love Canal health studies in 1991. The NRC noted the major exposure of concern was the groundwater rather than drinking water; the groundwater [...] "seeped into basements" [...] and then led to exposure through air and soil noted several studies {{reported higher levels of}} low-birth weight babies and birth defects among the exposed residents with some evidence the effect subsided after the exposure was eliminated. The National Research Council also noted a study which found exposed children were found to have an [...] "excess of seizures, learning problems, hyperactivity, eye irritation, skin rashes, abdominal pain, and incontinence" [...] and stunted growth. Voles in the area were found to have significantly increased mortality compared to controls (mean life expectancy in exposed animals [...] "23.6 and 29.2 days, respectively, compared to 48.8 days" [...] for control animals). New York State also has an ongoing health study of Love Canal residents. In that year, the Albert Elia Building Co., Inc., now Sevenson Environmental Services, Inc., was selected as the principal contractor to safely re-bury the toxic waste at the Love Canal Site.|$|E
