5|$|The {{regional}} ORCA {{card was}} introduced as an integrated smart card for transit {{agencies in the}} Puget Sound region on April 20, 2009, allowing users to load monthly passes and value through an e-purse <b>web</b> <b>interface.</b> The card also allowed free transfers within a two-hour period between transit agencies of equal value, with the difference for higher fare subtracted from the e-purse or prompting for cash. While initially available for no fee, effective March 1, 2010 a $5 cost was added when ordering a standard adult or youth ORCA card. CT removed their paper transfers on January 1, 2010 after the ORCA card made them obsolete.|$|E

Our design extends the Android Framework, and enables developers to create easily secure <b>web</b> <b>interfaces</b> for their applications. To motivate our work, we perform an in-depth study of the security of <b>web</b> <b>interfaces</b> embedded in consumer electronics devices, uncover significant vulnerabilities in all the devices examined, and categorize the vulnerabilities. We demonstrate how our framework’s security mechanisms prevent embedded applications from suffering the vulnerabilities exposed by our audit. Finally we evaluate the efficiency of our framework in terms of performance and security. ...|$|R

40|$|User Interfaces {{have gone}} a major {{transformation}} since 1970 s, {{all this was}} possible because of the advances in HCI and related technologies. The Principles of User Interface design has contributed much to the change {{that we see in}} the present day user interfaces and predominantly the <b>web</b> <b>interfaces</b> of various websites. This paper presents the various General Principles of User Interface Design and their relevance for present day <b>web</b> <b>interfaces</b> with full length analysis. Each principle is investigated over five different types of <b>web</b> <b>interfaces</b> with 30 different websites per type. The various properties that contribute to the principles have been investigated thoroughly and their statistical values are reported in their entirety...|$|R
40|$|Embedded {{devices are}} {{becoming}} more widespread, interconnected, and web-enabled than ever. However, recent studies showed that these devices are far from being secure. Moreover, many embedded systems rely on <b>web</b> <b>interfaces</b> for user interaction or administration. Unfortunately, web security {{is known to be}} difficult, and therefore the <b>web</b> <b>interfaces</b> of embedded systems represent a considerable attack surface. In this paper, we present the first fully automated framework that applies dynamic firmware analysis techniques to achieve, in a scalable manner, automated vulnerability discovery within embedded firmware images. We apply our framework to study the security of embedded <b>web</b> <b>interfaces</b> running in Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) embedded devices, such as routers, DSL/cable modems, VoIP phones, IP/CCTV cameras. We introduce a methodology and implement a scalable framework for discovery of vulnerabilities in embedded <b>web</b> <b>interfaces</b> regardless of the vendor, device, or architecture. To achieve this goal, our framework performs full system emulation to achieve the execution of firmware images in a software-only environment, i. e., without involving any physical embedded devices. Then, we analyze the <b>web</b> <b>interfaces</b> within the firmware using both static and dynamic tools. We also present some interesting case-studies, and discuss the main challenges associated with the dynamic analysis of firmware images and their <b>web</b> <b>interfaces</b> and network services. The observations we make in this paper shed light on an important aspect of embedded devices which was not previously studied at a large scale. We validate our framework by testing it on 1925 firmware images from 54 different vendors. We discover important vulnerabilities in 185 firmware images, affecting nearly a quarter of vendors in our dataset. These experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach...|$|R
