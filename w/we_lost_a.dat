500|$|Late {{at night}} on July 28, 1962, Costa {{was killed in a}} car crash, {{involving}} no other vehicles, on New York's Westside Highway at 72nd Street. He was survived by his wife and four children. This loss to music was summarized years later in the liner notes to one of his recordings: [...] "No pianist with his combination of strength, humor, and drive has developed in the sixties or seventies, and as the years go by it becomes more apparent that <b>we</b> <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> unique creative musician". In his eight-year recording career, Costa appeared on more than 100 albums. He never recorded a solo album.|$|E
500|$|I {{remember}} {{not just}} because it was a win, but also because it was a big fight right into the last night. Fabrizia reminded me the other night that we had a problem with the brake pads, so <b>we</b> <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> lot of time. We finished three days rallying (with one day to go), night and day, 32 seconds in front of Ari Vatanen. We drove the last special stage for the night, came back to the hotel and I could not sleep at all, four hours {{in front of me and}} no sleep. Then I arrive at the special stage, it's about 42km long, and I look at Fabrizia and I said [...] "OK, we forget everything, and we are at the first stage of the rally again, because one of us will crash." [...] And so Ari hit a rock, and we won the rally.|$|E
500|$|President Obama {{said that}} Kennedy's death marked the [...] "passing of an {{extraordinary}} leader" [...] and that he and First Lady Michelle Obama were [...] "heartbroken" [...] to learn of his passing, while Vice President Biden said [...] "today <b>we</b> <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> truly remarkable man," [...] and that Kennedy [...] "changed the circumstances of {{tens of millions of}} Americans". Mitt Romney, former Massachusetts Governor and Kennedy's opponent in the 1994 senate race, called Kennedy [...] "the kind of man you could like even if he was your adversary" [...] and former First Lady Nancy Reagan said she was [...] "terribly saddened". [...] She went on, [...] "Given our political differences, people are sometimes surprised how close Ronnie and I have been to the Kennedy family.... I will miss him." [...] Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, the President pro tempore of the Senate, issued a statement on Kennedy's death in which he said [...] "My heart and soul weeps at the loss of my best friend in the Senate, my beloved friend, Ted Kennedy." [...] (Byrd had broken down on the Senate floor and cried uncontrollably when Kennedy's cancer diagnosis was made public the previous year.) Upon his death, his sister Jean is the only one still living of the nine Kennedy siblings.|$|E
2500|$|Utah senator Orrin Hatch {{paid tribute}} to Wiesel in a speech on the Senate floor the {{following}} week, where he said that [...] "With Elie's passing <b>we</b> have <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> beacon of humanity and hope. <b>We</b> have <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> hero {{of human rights and}} a luminary of Holocaust literature." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Made {{with these}} hands. I {{added a few}} more raisins yesterday, to speed things up a bit. There is much virtue in your raisin. And, talking of {{speeding}} things up, for goodness' sake {{try to be a}} bit more punctual to-morrow. <b>We</b> <b>lost</b> <b>an</b> hour of good daylight to-day." ...|$|R
60|$|Then we {{saw what}} the trouble was--at some time or other we had drifted {{down the wrong}} side of an island and {{followed}} a sluggish branch of the Rhone not frequented in modern times. <b>We</b> <b>lost</b> <b>an</b> hour and a half by it and missed one of the most picturesque and gigantic and history-sodden masses of castellated medieval ruin that Europe can show.|$|R
500|$|The song {{begins with}} Knowles singing: [...] "I feel weak / We've {{been here before}} / 'Cause I feel we keep {{going back and forth}} / Maybe it's over, maybe we're through / But I {{honestly}} can say I still love you." [...] The introduction is skeletal as it contains only atmospheric synthesizers and insistent drum tapping, which have been further described as [...] "warbly [...] lighthearted". Throughout the song, the swaths of reverb occasionally pierce through the production. In the pre-chorus lines, Knowles sings: [...] "Maybe it's over, maybe we're through, but I honestly can say I still love you / Maybe we reached a mountain peak and there’s no more left to climb / and maybe <b>we</b> <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> magic piece and we're too blind to find" [...] while her vocals are followed by background sounds. The beat steadily grows from the verses to the bridge and, finally, to the chorus, with pounding drums coming into the loop during the refrain as Knowles sings: [...] "Let’s start over / Let's give love their wings / Let’s start over / Stop fighting bout the same old thing". As she belts the high notes and the drum beats continue to catch up, she urges her man to [...] "give love another life". During the bridge, Knowles sings: [...] "I know I called you selfish / But that’s a lie", over a simple piano line.|$|E
2500|$|Lubbock {{attorney}} George Gilkerson {{said that}} Carr was [...] "an outstanding person, {{a pillar of}} integrity, and [...] likely won't ever see someone like him again. [...] think <b>we</b> <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> giant of a lawyer and a very true advocate. He was very well thought of -- even by his foes." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Soka Gakkai's {{subsidiary}} organizations {{also have}} social influence. [...] The Min-on Concert Association is {{a subsidiary of}} the Soka Gakkai which Ikeda established in 1963. [...] It claims to sponsor over 1100 concerts each year. It has sponsored tours by international artists such as the La Scala Opera Company, about which Ikeda told Min-on's director that he [...] "wanted average [...] Japanese people to see first class art, even if <b>we</b> <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> lot of money".|$|E

2500|$|Nicknamed la Faucheuse (the Grim Reaper), Betsen's finest {{moment came}} during the 2002 Six Nations Championship, in the match against , when his {{relentless}} man-marking of Jonny Wilkinson eventually resulted in the fly-half's replacement and {{paved the way for}} a 20–15 victory. Later, England's coach, Clive Woodward, said of Betsen: [...] "“He is the only player that I can say was the single-handed reason <b>we</b> <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> match." [...] France {{went on to win the}} Grand Slam and Betsen was named France's International Player of the Year. He was an automatic selection for the 2003 Rugby World Cup and scored France's only try in the semi-final loss to England.|$|E
2500|$|Gilmour later said, [...] "When {{we first}} started playing World Series Cricket, I think <b>we</b> <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> lot of friends ... not player-wise, I don't think ... the players are OK. It's the {{officials}} that take a bit of swaying again... There were officials with the cricket association who I regarded as good friends and I had drinks with them whenever I was in Sydney or whenever they were in Newcastle. And they started treating me and the other players in WSC like lepers. I {{think that was the}} most hurtful thing of all. It was something that they didn't go along with and they just couldn't handle it".".|$|E
2500|$|Additionally, {{those within}} the {{political}} spectrum that offered their condolences included Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, {{who said that he}} [...] "convey my heartfelt condolences {{to the members of the}} bereaved family and countless fans and admirers of Shri Rajesh Khanna." [...] INC President Sonia Gandhi also expressed her sorrow. Regional political leaders who offered their condolences included Chief Minister of West Bengal Mamata Banerjee, who said: [...] "Rajesh Khanna was always a symbol of romance. His smiling face and the ability to connect with people at ease had made him popular. <b>We</b> <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> big pole star in the film world today." [...] As well as Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar who added that [...] "his death has caused irreparable loss to Hindi cinema." ...|$|E
50|$|Jack {{suffered}} {{very little}} for he didn't live long. I saw Jack {{soon after he}} was hit. With calmness, serenity and complacency, Jack said, 'The New York Giants <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> good man.' <b>We</b> all <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> good man.|$|R
6000|$|... "But what do {{you want}} to know for?" [...] asked Nunez. [...] "I suppose {{somebody}} on shore has built a fire. Is there any good stopping for that? <b>We</b> have <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> lot of time already." ...|$|R

I think that if you were to describe this recruiting class, they are a big, athletic bunch of athletes who can run and hit. They are also good students. I am really putting an emphasis on guys who can be successful in life, and who have goals that they want to achieve... We have 15 local-area players. There are some others that we would have liked to have, but you are never going to get all of them. We put a lot of stock in trying to recruit the local-area kids." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Brethren," [...] cried Ithiel, {{in answer}} to the {{challenge}} of one who was set to watch the entry, [...] "I bring back to you her whom <b>we</b> <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> while ago, the lady Miriam." ...|$|E
60|$|We made {{no great}} gain, however, by this victory, for <b>we</b> <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> camel and gained a horse. I {{paid for the}} lost camel, and sent for another; but I {{did not go to}} fetch it myself: I had had enough of that.|$|E
40|$|Alfred Goodman Gilman died on 23 December, after a {{protracted}} battle with pancreatic cancer. <b>We</b> <b>lost</b> <b>an</b> extraordinary scientist, academic leader, and “mensch. ” Al pioneered {{our understanding of}} the biochemical mechanisms that drive signal transduction and (with Martin Rodbell) shared the 1994 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine {{for his role in the}} discovery of heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins). He went on to describe the basic design of G protein-mediated cellular signaling circuits that regulate an enormous number of physiological responses and are the targets of a large fraction of today's drugs...|$|R
50|$|You have to {{put things}} in proportion. These are small war crimes. All told, if we take all the massacres and all the executions of 1948, we come to about 800 who were killed. In {{comparison}} to the massacres that were perpetrated in Bosnia, that's peanuts. In comparison to the massacres the Russians perpetrated against the Germans at Stalingrad, that's chicken feed. When you {{take into account that}} there was a bloody civil war here and that <b>we</b> <b>lost</b> <b>an</b> entire 1 percent of the population, you find that we behaved very well.|$|R
5000|$|A year ago, Dragotin Kette {{passed away}} in Ljubljana and some {{newspapers}} reported that <b>we</b> had <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> very talented poet. Few realized {{that the young man}} that had died was the biggest talent we have had since Prešeren.|$|R

Nothing unpleasant occurred until noon, with the exception of Doctor Foxey's brown silk umbrella and white hat becoming entangled in the machinery while he was explaining to a knot of ladies the construction of the steam- engine. I fear the gravy soup for lunch was injudicious. <b>We</b> <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> great many passengers almost immediately afterwards.' ...|$|E
60|$|The {{music of}} a donkey awoke us {{early in the}} morning, and we rose up and made ready for a pretty {{formidable}} walk--to Italy; but the road was so level that we took the train.. <b>We</b> <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> {{good deal of time}} by this, but it was no matter, we were not in a hurry.

6000|$|It is now forty-six {{years since}} <b>we</b> <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> child,(285) and he who [...] has now passed {{away from our}} eyes, leaves to us only blessed [...] recollections.
