There were only 27 U.S. cities with wastewater treatment works by 1892, most of them [...] "treating" [...] <b>wastewater</b> through <b>land</b> <b>application.</b> Of these 27 cities, 26 had separate sanitary and storm water sewer systems, thus facilitating wastewater treatment, {{because there was no}} need for large capacitites to accommodate wet weather flows. Furthermore, there was a belief that the diluted combined wastewater was not harmful to receiving waters, due to the natural dilution and self-purifying capacity of rivers, lakes and the sea. In the early 20th century a debate evolved between those who thought it was in the best interest of public health to construct wastewater treatment facilities and those who believed building them was unnecessary. Nevertheless, many cities began to opt for separate sewer systems, creating favorable conditions for adding wastewater treatment plants in the future.|$|R

40|$|Interest {{in the use}} of {{non-traditional}} {{waste management}} systems is increasing. This research determines the feasibility of using free water surface constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment on dairy and swine operations in northern Indiana. Research was conducted on a 16 -cell in parallel constructed wetland system at the Purdue University Animal Sciences Swine Research Complex, a 3 -cell in parallel constructed wetland system at Norwood Farms, Inc., and a 2 -cell in series constructed wetland system at Tom Brothers Dairy. All sites are in the northern third of Indiana. Data were collected from Norwood Farms in 1993 and 1994, and from Purdue University and Tom Brothers in 1994 and 1995. Constructed wetlands may be used as components in total animal waste management systems. These systems reduce levels of nutrients in wastewater, reducing the amount of land needed for final disposal of <b>wastewater</b> through <b>land</b> <b>application.</b> Reductions in carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand, fecal coliform bacteria, total suspended solids, phosphates, total phosphorus, ammonia-nitrogen, and total nitrogen have been achieved with both dairy and swine wastewater. Constructed wetland systems require that raw wastewater be pretreated in lagoons, or similar separation systems, to remove solids from the waste stream. Operators must perform routine system maintenance and follow year-round management plans for wetland systems to be successful. Chemical tracers show that unlined systems, placed on farms where soils have low hydraulic conductivity, pose little threat to groundwater contamination. Designs that incorporate multiple cells in series are recommended. Alternating areas of open water with vegetated areas within wetland systems should improve treatment of ammonia-nitrogen and phosphates. An initial open water area should be used if influent suspended solids levels are above 500 mg L- 1. ...|$|R

However, the use of inappropriate irrigation practices could result in a serious contamination risk to plants, soils, and groundwater with sewage water. This research was initiated in view to the increasing danger of vegetable crops and groundwater contamination with pathogenic bacteria due to <b>wastewater</b> <b>land</b> <b>application.</b> The research was designed to study: (1) the effect of treated wastewater irrigation on the yield and microbial contamination of the radish plant under field conditions; (2) contamination of the agricultural soil profile with fecal coliform bacteria. Effluent from a domestic wastewater treatment plant (100 %) in Jeddah city, Saudi Arabia, was diluted to 80 % and 40 % with the groundwater of the experimental site constituting three different water qualities plus groundwater as control. Radish plant was grown in two consecutive seasons under two drip irrigation systems and four irrigation water qualities. Upon harvesting, plant weight per ha, total bacterial, fecal coliform, fecal streptococci were detected per 100 g of dry matter and compared with the control. The soil profile was also sampled at an equal distance of 3 cm from soil surface for fecal coliform detection. The results indicated that the yield increased significantly under the subsurface irrigation system and the control water quality compared to surface irrigation system and other water qualities. There was a considerable drop in the count of all bacteria species under the subsurface irrigation system compared to surface irrigation. The bacterial count/g of the plant shoot system increased as the percentage of wastewater in the irrigation water increased. Most of the fecal coliform bacteria were deposited in the first few centimeters below the column inlet and the profile exponentially decreased with increasing depth...|$|E
40|$|Land {{application}} of wastewater {{can have the}} effect of treating effluent as well as disposing of it. In addition, nutrients and irrigation water can be recycled for the use in agriculture and forestry. Therefore, land application is an economical means of water reuse and effluent disposal. However, if inappropriately planned and managed, it can have negative impacts on the environment. Site selection is particularly crucial when planning a <b>wastewater</b> <b>land</b> <b>application</b> scheme. An appropriate site selection ensures the technical and economic feasibility of such a scheme and helps reduce environmental impacts and risks. In addition, social and economic aspects need to be considered for the site selection. The present study aimed at identifying potential sites for the land {{application of}} the effluent of the Christchurch City Wastewater Treatment Plant. The analysis was carried out using a GIS, which enabled an efficient combination of all factors influencing the suitability of a site, and included the area of Christchurch City and its three adjacent districts; Waimakariri, Selwyn and Banks Peninsula. To ensure technical feasibility, environmental sustainability, social acceptability and economic viability a number of factors had to be considered for the site selection. These include the following: Slope, climate, soil type, soil pH, soil depth, land use, distance to groundwater, distance to surface waters, and distance to dwellings. Raster layers of these factors were overlaid in the GIS. This resulted in the elimination of all areas that are unsuitable for land application and the identification of candidate areas. A digital layer was created showing the candidate areas in the study area. Four potential sites were identified from the candidate areas to highlight the relative suitability between the sites. A rating system using numeric values was used to assess and screen the candidate areas and the potential sites. The rating was based on five of the above mentioned suitability factors and the distance between site and plant...|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{regulatory}} agencies often face difficult challenges {{in trying to}} resolve conflicts involving populations impacted by neighboring facility operations. Problems are particularly complex when issues involve nuisance conditions or aesthetics because the insult is subjective and difficult to quantify. Often, there are no clear regulatory paths forward to resolve concerns. A food processing plant in southwest Idaho obtained the necessary state and county permits to utilize a <b>wastewater</b> <b>land</b> <b>application</b> process to treat plant effluent. Private property owners registered numerous complaints concerning odors associated with system operations. The Idaho Division of Environmental Quality (IDEQ) investigated those complaints and held public meetings to gather input. A citizen advisory group was established {{to work with the}} agency in trying to resolve the concerns. Meetings were held to facilitate dialogue geared towards problem solving. The company undertook steps to try and improve the situation. After a period of time, many of the advisory group members felt that progress had been made and were no longer demanding that the facility be shut down. The state regulatory agency received a new waste water land application permit from the facility for review and processing. The use of a citizen advisory group involving stakeholders to resolve environmental conflicts can be a productive exercise if managed well. More importantly, it can lead to a long term solution that will minimize future resource requirements as well as provide a sense of ownership in an effective outcome. The problem was to review how the process through which the subject citizen advisory group evolved and attempt to identify discreet stages that the group passed through during the attempts at environmental conflict resolution. The subject study demonstrated the efficacy of using this approach to resolve environmental conflict. Changes in the attitudes and perceptions of groups members were observed {{during the course of the}} interactions.

The most advanced treatment technologies, as well as, the most representative methods and indicator organisms are necessary to ensure public safety. The goal of this dissertation is to assess advanced Bardenpho wastewater treatment technologies in regards to virus removal, suggest the most appropriate viral indicators of human fecal contamination and/or treatment process controls, and develop an updated method for enumerating Ascaris ova viability in land applied biosolids. Appendix A evaluates the incidence of 11 different virus types in sewage throughout a 12 -month time period, and their subsequent reduction via advanced Bardenpho treatment processes. This study showed that wastewater treatment facilities utilizing advanced Bardenpho for secondary treatment are more effective at reducing viruses in wastewater than facilities utilizing conventional aeration basin and trickling filter processes. Appendix B develops a new method for determining the viability of Ascaris ova in land applied biosolids.

40|$|The {{application}} of municipal <b>wastewater</b> to <b>land</b> for treatment and disposal, or "land farms, " {{was one of}} the earliest forms of wastewater treatment technology. There has been renewed interest in using these systems in arid regons worldwide to supplement and reuse dwindling water resources. However, arid regions present complex challenges to the use of <b>land</b> <b>application</b> systems. Many arid regions (for example, Egypt and US/Mexico border) are located in areas that lack infrastructure support and cannot afford expensive treatment technologies.

Over 71, 000 individual samples from 1967 - 2010 were analyzed. Each sample station was cataloged using GIS coverages as being either upstream or downstream of a permitted <b>wastewater</b> discharge or <b>land</b> <b>application</b> systems (LAS). Generally, over the period of record, sites downstream of permitted wastewater facilities show higher Total Phosphorus statewide. Total Nitrogen values are split between north Georgia (Ecoregions 68, 67, 66, and 45) and south Georgia (Ecoregions 75 and 65). In north Georgia, Total Nitrogen appears to be greater in downstream sites, whereas the trend is unclear in south Georgia. Decadal trends for each Ecoregion were also analyzed. Generally a declining trend was observed for Total Phospohrus, whereas Total Nitrogen was flat or increasing. Sponsored by: Georgia Environmental Protection Division U. S.

40|$|The {{environmental}} impact of the livestock sector in North-East Italy directly affects water (nitrates accumulation and eutrophication). Through the “Nitrate Directive” (91 / 676 /EEC), the EU aims to reduce water pollution caused or induced by nitrates from agricultural sources. Disposal of animal wastewater is a common problem among local farmers. Land spreading is the usual disposal method but requires sufficient land area {{in close proximity to}} the farm. Problems associate with animal <b>wastewater</b> treatment and <b>land</b> <b>application</b> has prompted an urgency to find alternative treatment systems that are technically feasible and economically viable. Hybrid constructed wetlands (HCW) are being considered as an alternative method for livestock wastewater disposal which could reduce the amount of land necessary for terminal <b>land</b> <b>application.</b> This work presents the results of monitoring a full-scale hybrid wetland system operating on a swine farm. The HCW system was composed of three vertical-subsurface flow wetlands (VF) in parallel with a total area of 30 m 2, followed by one horizontal-subsurface flow wetland (HF) connected in series (100 m 2). During the experimentation (2010 - 2012), HCW operated under different conditions: seasonal variations (temperature), pollutants concentrations, hydraulic loading rate (HLR), hydraulic retention time (HRT), feeding mode and operational regimes. During the first period (April 2010 -July 2010) the system was loaded with 5 m 3 /d of pre-treated piggery wastewater and VF system worked like a “biological filter”. During the second period (October 2010 -April 2011), the system was loaded with 5 m 3 /d of raw piggery wastewater, a sequential batch (feed-stay-drain-rest) feed mode in VF system was used. To determine if winter climate conditions influence treatment effectiveness, during the third period (May 2011 -July 2012) the system was loaded with 1. 7 m 3 /d of synthetic wastewater. VF system was fed with sequential batch mode with two different operational regimes. Overall concentration reduction obtained by HCW system for COD ranged from 46 to 56 %, for total nitrogen from 40 to 54 %, for ammonia nitrogen from 43 to 60 %, for nitric nitrogen from 21 to 55 %, for total phosphorus from 32 to 35 % and for orthophosphate from 24 to 34 %...|$|R

Tracer f 2 penetrated into groundwater together with the front of percolating primary effluent and was not observed to concentrate on the upper soil layers. The tracer virus concentration in a 60 -foot (about 18. 3 -m) -deep observation well directly beneath the wastewater application area began to increase within 48 h after application to the soil. The tracer level in this well stabilized after 72 h at a level of approximately 47 % of the average applied concentration. Indigenous enteroviruses and tracer f 2 were sporadically detected in the groundwater at horizontal distances of 600 feet (about 183 m) from the application zone. Laboratory soil adsorption studies confirmed the poor virus adsorption observed at the site. This was especially true on surface soils when contained in wastewater. Enteric indicator bacteria were readily concentrated on the soil surface by filtration on the soil surface mat. However, during tracer f 2 virus tests, comparison studies with fecal Streptococcus revealed that bacteria capable of penetrating the surface were able to migrate into the groundwater.

In the Bocas del Toro Province of Panama (and similar locations in the world), composting latrines have been built in many of the indigenous communities in the area. They are a form of dry or ecological sanitation and are designed to produce an end product that can be used as a soil amendment for agricultural purposes. The issue is that many of these latrines are not working as designed and do not go through the composting process. Instead, they may act as incubators for harmful pathogens, such as Ascaris lumbricoides (roundworm).

We will refer {{to all of these}} organizations as the “petitioners. ” Specifically, the petitioners requested that EPA place an immediate moratorium on the <b>land</b> <b>application</b> of sewage sludge by taking the following actions: (1) freeze the issuance of new National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits authorizing the <b>land</b> <b>application</b> of bulk sewage sludge; (2) rewrite and reissue NPDES permits to require a method of sewage sludge disposal other than <b>land</b> <b>application</b> to replace all NPDES permits currently in force that allow the <b>land</b> <b>application</b> of bulk sewage sludge; and (3) initiate rulemaking to change the Part 503 Sludge Rule promulgated under the authority of the Clean Water Act (CWA) at 40 CFR 503 to eliminate <b>land</b> <b>application</b> as an acceptable practice for sewage sludge disposal. This letter constitutes EPA’s determination on the issues raised in the petition. EPA has carefully evaluated the information provided in the petition, as well as other sources of information, and has concluded that the facts do not support a moratorium on <b>land</b> <b>application</b> of sewage sludge. Based on the information below, the Agency is denying the petition. Statutory and Regulatory Backgroun...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Capstone Project was to provide initial {{recommendations}} regarding OWASA‘s future sustainability efforts, primarily focusing on the evaluation of impacts, challenges and opportunities associated with OWASA‘s management of the treated biosolids that are generated during the wastewater treatment process. Our project deliverables consist of three parts: 1. An analysis of the health effects associated with the <b>land</b> <b>application</b> of biosolids 2. An in-depth evaluation of pretreatment and post-treatment technologies and alternatives to biosolids <b>land</b> <b>application</b> 3. Interviews with community members, public figures, and top biosolids researchers The potential health effects associated with the <b>land</b> <b>application</b> of biosolids constitute a topic that Carrboro and Chapel Hill community members are very concerned with. Therefore, an initial literature review was completed to determine how detrimental the <b>land</b> <b>application</b> of biosolids really is to public health. Our group found that {{there is very little}} known about the health effects of biosolids <b>land</b> <b>application,</b> either in the short or long-term. Because the health risks associated with <b>land</b> <b>application</b> are unknown, we recommend that OWASA look into treatment technologies that further reduce pathogens and pollutants in biosolids...|$|R
