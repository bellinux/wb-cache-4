Despite the ubiquitous use of video coding techniques, {{it is interesting to note}} that a closed form rate-distortion characterization for video coding is not available in the literature.

The concept of conditional motion estimation is used to derive the closedform expression for rate-distortion region <b>without</b> <b>losing</b> its <b>generality.</b> Conditional motion estimation offers an elegant means to analyze the rate-distortion trade-offs and demonstrates the viability of achieving the bounds derived.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{response}} to difficulties reported in applying feedforward neural networks (NNs) to seasonal data. The solution we propose is a modified network model which is pruned and optimised by means of Differential Evolution methods. The problem for NNs in the case of seasonality lies in the so-called 'universal approximation' property, which underpins the use of MLP networks as a vehicle for flexible non-linear regression. Our view is that seasonality is best modelled by using sinusoids, which permit the use of more powerful analytical tools <b>without</b> <b>losing</b> any <b>generality</b> as compared with dummy variables. However, the actual theorems supporting NN approximation specifically relate to functions possessing suitable properties of smoothness, in which case {{it is not surprising that}} NNs have difficulty with seasonality. Only a very 'short' sinusoid would be smooth enough. Our suggested solution is to transform the input variable so that instead of using a time variable alone we have sinusoids as inputs. In theoretical terms, this helps restore the approximation property, as can also be seen in our examples, which also serve to illustrate the strength of Differential Evolution methods...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a continuous-time mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model for short-term scheduling of multi-stage multi-product batch plants. The model determines the optimal sequencing and {{the allocation of}} customer orders to non-identical processing units by minimizing the earliness and tardiness of order completion. This is a highly combinatorial problem, especially when sequence-dependent relations are considered such as the setup time between consecutive orders. A common approach to this scheduling problem relies on the application of tetra-index binary variables, i. e. (order, order, stage, unit) to represent all the combinations of order sequences and assignments to units in the various stages. This generates {{a huge number of}} binary variables and, as a consequence, much time is required for solutions. This paper proposes a novel formulation that replaces the tetra-index binary variables by one set of tri-index binary variables (order, order, stage) <b>without</b> <b>losing</b> the model's <b>generality.</b> By the elimination of the unit index, the new formulation requires considerably fewer binary variables, thus significantly shortening the solution time.

In {{the absence of a}} real MRI scan, pseudo MRI (i. e., associated headmodel and sourcemodel) is often approximated from an available standard MRI template or pool of MRI scans considering the subject's digitized head surface. In the present study, we approximated two types of pseudo MRI (i. e., associated headmodel and sourcemodel) using an available pool of MRI scans with the focus on MEG source imaging. The first was the first rank pseudo MRI; that is, the MRI scan in the dataset having the lowest objective registration error (ORE) after being registered (rigid body transformation with isotropic scaling) to the subject's digitized head surface. The second was the averaged rank pseudo MRI that is generated by averaging of headmodels and sourcemodels from multiple MRI scans respectively, after being registered to the subject's digitized head surface. Subject level analysis showed that the mean upper bound of source location error for the approximated sourcemodel in reference to the real one was 10 ± 3 mm for the averaged rank pseudo MRI, which was significantly lower than the first rank pseudo MRI approach. Functional group source response in the brain to visual stimulation in the form of event-related power (ERP) at the time latency of peak amplitude showed noticeably identical source distribution for first rank pseudo MRI, averaged rank pseudo MRI, and real MRI. The source localization error for functional peak response was significantly lower for averaged rank pseudo MRI compared to first rank pseudo MRI.
