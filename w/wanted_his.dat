5|$|Beechwood Theater, {{a replica}} of the Little Theater on Broadway, was {{included}} in Wells Bosworth's design of the primary school building because Vanderlip particularly <b>wanted</b> <b>his</b> own theater. Beechwood Theater, with 256 gold velvet seats, was designed by Winthrop Ames around 1917. Details were closely examined upon construction; the lighting equipment, the scene lofts and fly gallery, and the dressing rooms were well-designed and state-of-the-art. The stage floor was designed especially for dancing, and the acoustics and theater proportions made varieties of productions possible.|$|E
5|$|Early in the 1934 season, Ruth openly campaigned {{to become}} the Yankees manager. However, the Yankee job was never a serious possibility. Ruppert always {{supported}} McCarthy, who would remain in his position for another 12 seasons. Ruth and McCarthy's relationship had been lukewarm at best, and Ruth's managerial ambitions further chilled their relations. By {{the end of the}} season, Ruth hinted that he would retire unless Ruppert named him manager of the Yankees. When the time came, Ruppert <b>wanted</b> <b>his</b> slugger to leave the team without drama or hard feelings.|$|E

5|$|In {{designing}} the game mechanics, Naka {{was inspired by}} Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto, whose games he had enjoyed playing years earlier. Admiring the simplicity of Miyamoto's mechanics in complex environments, Naka decided that Sonic would be controlled with only a directional pad for movement and a single button for jumping. He also <b>wanted</b> <b>his</b> creation to be more action-oriented than the Mario series; while playing Super Mario Bros., he had wondered why the levels could not be cleared more quickly.|$|E
5|$|In ecclesiastical affairs, Hugh {{attended}} the 1163 Council of Tours {{that was held}} by Pope Alexander III. In 1179 he {{attended the}} Lateran Council at Rome. It was {{while he was there}} that he became involved in the conflict between the king of Scots and the chapter of St Andrews over the election of the bishop of St Andrews. The king <b>wanted</b> <b>his</b> chaplain, another Hugh, and the chapter wanted John the Scot. The pope ordered Puiset to compel the king to obey, but in 1183 the controversy was solved by a compromise.|$|E

5|$|Krishna Dhun Ghose <b>wanted</b> <b>his</b> sons {{to enter}} the Indian Civil Service (ICS), an elite {{organisation}} comprising around 1000 people. To achieve this it was necessary that they study in England {{and so it was}} there that the entire family moved in 1879. The three brothers were placed in the care of the Reverend W. H. Drewett in Manchester. Drewett was a minister of the Congregational Church whom Krishna Dhun Ghose knew through his British friends at Rangapur.|$|E
5|$|Not all, one suspects, were yielded willingly to Æthelwold's {{grasping}} representatives... Æthelwold obviously <b>wanted</b> <b>his</b> monasteries to be centres {{of spiritual}} power, an aim {{he sought to}} fulfil by making them the home of as many saints as possible. Undoubtedly too he was anxious to remove relics from the guardianship of secular communities to a reformed monastic environment. But ultimately even more vital was the link between cult and territorial possession, focused on the saint's role as protector and spiritual lord of his community.|$|E
5|$|On August 8, 1993, Wallace's {{longtime}} girlfriend {{gave birth}} to his first child, T'yanna. Wallace had split with the girlfriend for some time before T'yanna's birth. Wallace <b>wanted</b> <b>his</b> daughter to complete her education, despite being {{a high school dropout}} himself. Wallace said that if his mother had promised him what he promised his daughter, everything she wanted, Wallace would have been not only a graduate but also {{at the top of his}} class. He continued selling drugs after the birth to support his daughter financially. Once Combs discovered this, he forced Wallace to quit.|$|E

5|$|The {{consequences}} of the decree for composers were harsh. Shostakovich {{was among those who}} were dismissed from the Conservatory altogether. For Shostakovich, the loss of money was perhaps the largest blow. Others still in the Conservatory experienced an atmosphere that was thick with suspicion. No one <b>wanted</b> <b>his</b> work to be understood as formalist, so many resorted to accusing their colleagues of writing or performing anti-proletarian music.|$|E
5|$|While {{he would}} not appoint any Democrats, Taylor <b>wanted</b> <b>his</b> cabinet to reflect the nation's diverse interests, and so apportioned the seats geographically. He also avoided {{choosing}} prominent Whigs, sidestepping such obvious selections as Clay. He saw Crittenden as a cornerstone of his administration, offering him the crucial seat of Secretary of State, but Crittenden insisted on serving out the Governorship of Kentucky {{to which he had}} just been elected. Taylor settled instead on Senator John M. Clayton of Delaware, a close associate of Crittenden's.|$|E
5|$|Aditya Chopra <b>wanted</b> <b>his</b> father, Yash Chopra, to {{make another}} film and {{approached}} him with the concept for Jab Tak Hai Jaan. Shah Rukh Khan was their first choice {{for the role of}} Samar Anand, due to his long-standing relationship with the production house and the Chopra family. Khan, who was working on other projects at that time, was unavailable for the shooting schedule so it was changed. As in his previous productions, Yash Chopra wanted to introduce a fresh pairing in Jab Tak Hai Jaan and chose Katrina Kaif to star with Khan. Anushka Sharma was cast in a supporting role to complete her three-film contract with Yash Raj Films, with whom she had worked on many previous projects. Though casting was quickly completed, shooting was delayed because the lead actors were busy with other projects.|$|E

5|$|After the Second Punic War, {{there was}} a great {{increase}} in income inequality. While the middle class was drafted to serve in increasingly long campaigns, their farms and homesteads fell into bankruptcy. And with Rome's great military victories, vast numbers of slaves were imported into Italy. In the middle of the second century BC, the tribunate of Tiberius Gracchus led to a breakup of the long-standing norms of the republican constitution. Graccus' legislation effectively established a parallel administration challenging the socio-political power of the old aristocracy and establishing a precedent that the popular assemblies could vote themselves whatever they <b>wanted.</b> <b>His</b> younger brother, Gaius Gracchus, further challenged the Senate's political preeminence, by threatening it with new judicial procedures. The Senate's violent reaction against both the Gracchi, which led to their deaths, also served to legitimise the use of violence for political ends.|$|E
5|$|Benedetto Pistrucci {{was born}} in Rome on 24 May 1783, second child and son of Federico Pistrucci, Senior Judge of the High Criminal Court under the papal government, and Antonia (née Greco). His elder brother Filippo {{displayed}} artistic tendencies from a young age, but Benedetto showed mainly a disinclination to study. Federico Pistrucci <b>wanted</b> <b>his</b> sons to follow in his footsteps {{and sent them to}} Latin schools. Benedetto began his education in Bologna, where the family had property, but the Pistrucci family was forced to move to Rome in 1794 when Napoleon invaded Italy, and the boys were enrolled in the Roman College.|$|E
5|$|Cameron <b>wanted</b> <b>his</b> {{pitch for}} Daly to {{finalize}} {{the deal and}} had his friend Lance Henriksen show up to the meeting early dressed and acting like the Terminator. Henriksen, wearing a leather jacket, fake cuts on his face, and gold foil on his teeth, kicked {{open the door to}} the office and then sat in a chair. Cameron arrived shortly after which relieved the staff from Henriksen's act. Daly was impressed by the screenplay and Cameron's sketches and passion for the film. In late 1982, Daly agreed to back the film with help from HBO and Orion. The Terminator was originally budgeted at $4 million and later raised to $6.5 million. Hemdale, Pacific Western Productions and Cinema '84 have been credited as production companies after the film's release.|$|E

5|$|Chapman and Douglas Adams wrote a {{pilot for}} a TV series in 1975, Out of the Trees, but it {{received}} poor ratings after being broadcast {{at the same}} time as Match of the Day and only the initial episode was produced. In 1978, Chapman co-wrote the comedy film The Odd Job with McKenna, and starred as one of the main characters. Chapman <b>wanted</b> <b>his</b> friend Keith Moon to play a co-lead role alongside him, but Moon could not pass an acting test, so the part went to David Jason who had previously appeared on Do Not Adjust Your Set with Pythons Idle, Jones, and Palin. The film was moderately successful.|$|E
5|$|Chiranjeevi <b>wanted</b> <b>his</b> brother Nagendra Babu to work {{in films}} after graduating from college. To gain {{experience}} in film production, Babu worked at the Geetha Arts company. He started a company named Anjana Productions after his mother K. Anjana Devi. He planned to make an unconventional film without considering Chiranjeevi's on-screen image as an action hero. After watching Sankarabharanam (1980) and Sindhu Bhairavi (1985), Babu approached Chiranjeevi's mentor K. Balachander to direct his maiden production venture. They worked together on Idi Katha Kaadu (1979) and 47 Rojulu (1981); he played the antagonist in both films. Balachander agreed to direct the film; he chose the concept of national integration and rural development after watching Anna Hazare developing Ralegan Siddhi, a village in Maharashtra. He was also inspired by a retired Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer's act of adopting his village in West Godavari district.|$|E

After intense lobbying by Supervisors Milk and Silver, as well as State Assemblyman Willie Brown, Moscone announced on November 26, 1978, that he would not be reappointing Dan White to the seat he had vacated.|$|E
