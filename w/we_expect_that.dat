25|$|The arms of spiral galaxies rotate {{around the}} galactic centre. The {{luminous}} mass density of a spiral galaxy decreases as one goes from the centre to the outskirts. If luminous mass {{were all the}} matter, then we can model the galaxy as a point mass in the centre and test masses orbiting around it (similar to the solar system). From Kepler's Second Law, <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> <b>that</b> the rotation velocities will decrease with distance from the centre, similar to our solar system. This is not observed. Instead, the galaxy rotation curve remains flat as distant from the centre as the data is available.|$|E
25|$|Strictly speaking, the theorem only {{applies to}} a class of {{mathematical}} functions having a Fourier transform that is zero outside of a finite region of frequencies. Intuitively <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> <b>that</b> when one reduces a continuous function to a discrete sequence and interpolates back to a continuous function, the fidelity of the result depends on the density (or sample rate) of the original samples. The sampling theorem introduces {{the concept of a}} sample rate that is sufficient for perfect fidelity for the class of functions that are bandlimited to a given bandwidth, such that no actual information is lost in the sampling process. It expresses the sufficient sample rate in terms of the bandwidth for the class of functions. The theorem also leads to a formula for perfectly reconstructing the original continuous-time function from the samples.|$|E
25|$|Suppose that a Brownian {{particle}} of mass M {{is surrounded}} by lighter particles of mass m which are traveling at a speed u. Then, reasons Smoluchowski, in any collision between a surrounding and Brownian particles, the velocity transmitted to the latter will be mu/M. This ratio is {{of the order of}} 10−7cm/s. But we also have to take into consideration that in a gas there will be more than 1016 collisions in a second, and even greater in a liquid where <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> <b>that</b> there will be 1020 collision in one second. Some of these collisions will tend to accelerate the Brownian particle; others will tend to decelerate it. If there is a mean excess of one kind of collision or the other to be of the order of 108 to 1010 collisions in one second, then velocity of the Brownian particle may be anywhere between 10 and 1000cm/s. Thus, even though there are equal probabilities for forward and backward collisions there will be a net tendency to keep the Brownian particle in motion, just as the ballot theorem predicts.|$|E

2500|$|Many in the {{scientific}} community were critical of Nye's decision to participate in the event, claiming it lent undue credibility to the creationist worldview. The Biologos Foundation, an organization promoting the compatibility of science and religion, released a statement advocating evolutionary creation, maintaining the position [...] "that you don't have to choose. You don't have to give up Christian faith in order to accept the best, most compelling science. <b>We</b> <b>expect</b> <b>that</b> we'll agree with most of what Bill Nye will say about the science of evolution.

We believe that Jesus is the Son of God, that he died for our sins and rose from the dead, and that the Bible is the authoritative word of God." [...] Others expressed concern that Nye's relative lack of familiarity with evolution [...] his formal training is in mechanical engineering [...] and inexperience in debates might lead some to conclude that Ham won the debate. [...] "I am by no means an expert on most of this," [...] Nye later admitted, but added, [...] "In this situation, our skeptical arguments are not the stuff of Ph.Ds.

[...] In preparation for the event, Nye had lunch with scientists who specialize in evolutionary theory and traveled to Oakland, California, to meet with the staff of National Center for Science Education (NCSE), an advocacy group for teaching evolution. In an op-ed for CNN, Nye answered critics, saying, [...] "In short, I decided to participate in the debate because I felt it would draw attention to the importance of science education here in the United States."
