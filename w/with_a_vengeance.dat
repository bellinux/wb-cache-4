5|$|Having {{acquired}} major personal {{success and}} pop culture influence playing John McClane in Die Hard, Willis reprised {{his role in}} the sequels Die Hard 2 (1990) and Die Hard <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>Vengeance</b> (1995). These first three installments in the Die Hard series grossed over US$700 million internationally and propelled Willis to the first rank of Hollywood action stars.|$|E
5|$|Willis has {{appeared}} in four films with Samuel L. Jackson (National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1, Pulp Fiction, Die Hard <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>Vengeance,</b> and Unbreakable) and both actors were slated {{to work together in}} Black Water Transit, before dropping out. Willis also worked with his eldest daughter, Rumer, in the 2005 film Hostage. In 2007, he appeared in the thriller Perfect Stranger, opposite Halle Berry, the crime/drama film Alpha Dog, opposite Sharon Stone, and reprised his role as John McClane in Live Free or Die Hard. Subsequently, he appeared in the films What Just Happened and Surrogates, based on the comic book of the same name.|$|E

5|$|Ibira {{initially}} pictured Karas as {{a horror}} story <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>vengeance</b> theme. It had a simple plot {{similar to the}} manga, Dororo. The protagonist karas is on a quest, slaughtering mikuras to recover the body parts of his murdered lover. Until he recovers all the parts, he assembles them into a katana to kill the mikuras. The final version of Karas {{was more of a}} superhero action story, and originally intended for three leading heroes in the same vein as the Japanese period drama, Sanbiki ga Kiru!. The characters Otoha, Nue, and the human detective Kure were the leads but the final version primarily focused on Otoha. The presentation of Karas differs in several ways from typical anime. The show maintains a serious tone and never indulges in slapstick, exaggerated facial expressions, or super deformed characters. It avoids heavy expositions. Dialogue tends to be short and viewers have to infer what is going on based on very little presented information. The team had left out substantial amounts of information from the show, printing them in a booklet of the final DVD package.|$|E
5|$|Penn State {{received}} the opening kickoff, {{and on their}} first play from scrimmage, featured six offensive linemen (albeit unsuccessfully, as Bill Belton rushed for a one-yard loss), before driving down the field on a 13-play, 75-yard drive that culminated with Belton rushing for a five-yard touchdown; he carried the load on the drive, rushing the ball eight times for 36 yards. Penn State would never relinquish that lead. Purdue subsequently went three-and-out, and Penn State responded with another long drive (10 plays, 66 yards) that again culminated with a rushing touchdown, this time from Zach Zwinak on a one-yard run, his tenth touchdown of the season, becoming the 16th Penn State player to eclipse 10, and the first since 2008, when both Evan Royster and Daryll Clark did. Purdue's ensuing drive ended {{in the second quarter}} when quarterback Danny Etling threw a two-yard touchdown pass to Justin Sinz, making the score 14–7 Penn State. Bill Belton lost a fumble on Penn State's next drive, but Purdue turned the ball over right back to Penn State when Jordan Lucas intercepted an Etling pass. Zwinak rushed for his second one-yard touchdown of the game on the ensuing possession. The Nittany Lions scored once more in the first half, via an eight-yard pass from Christian Hackenberg to Adam Breneman, but on the ensuing kickoff, Purdue's Raheem Mostert scored a touchdown on a 100-yard return, thus ending the first half with a score of 28–14, Penn State holding the advantage. Purdue came out of halftime <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>vengeance,</b> driving down the field for 84-yards, ultimately pulling within 7 points on an 11-yard rush by Etling. The first field goal of the game occurred on Penn State's subsequent drive, a 29-yarder from Sam Ficken putting the Nittany Lions ahead 31–21. The Boilermakers turned the ball over again on their next drive, and Penn State capitalized when Zwinak rushed for his third touchdown of the game. Purdue turned the ball over on downs their final drive of the third quarter, though Hackenberg threw an interception giving Purdue an opportunity early in the fourth quarter; again, a fumble eliminated any chance of a scoring drive coming to fruition, and Penn State went up 45–21 when Hackenberg rushed for a 4-yard touchdown to culminate an 11-play, 74-yard drive that encapsulated over a third of the fourth quarter, and ended with 4:27 to play. That would be the final scoring drive of the game, which Penn State won by the aforementioned score, 45–21.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} {{season was}} not as impressive, but he returned to form <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>vengeance</b> in 1906, hitting 1,206 first-class runs at 43.07, with another innings of 165 against Oxford among his three centuries. That winter he visited New Zealand with MCC: he did relatively little with the bat, only twice passing 50 in 11 innings, but he did take his maiden wicket when he dismissed Wellington's Harold Monaghan.|$|E
25|$|CCK and General Wang needed credibility, and fast. They {{found it}} by moving against {{high-profile}} figures, {{under the protection}} of the Chiang family name. Among those arrested were Du Wei-ping, the son of “Big Ears” Du Yuesheng, the senior-most Green Gang triad boss; “Rice Tiger” Wan Moulin, a close associate of Du; and the managers of several industrial establishments owned by former prime minister (and CCK's uncle) T. V. Soong. Ultimately, the effort failed and the regulations were lifted by end-October and hyperinflation returned <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>vengeance.</b>|$|E
25|$|He {{played on}} in {{domestic}} cricket for {{another couple of}} seasons, although without any outstanding success, before bowing out with a game against Trinidad and Tobago in the 1998–99 Busta Cup. Ironically, his first-innings bowling performance {{was one of his}} most economical: his 10 overs went for only 19. However, the second innings was a different story as his no-ball problem returned <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>vengeance.</b> He sent down 12 of them in the space of seven wicketless overs, and with that he left the first-class game for good.|$|E

[...] Wayne Reimer, rating the album two stars at Jesus Freak Hideout, says, [...] "what we have here in Truer Living... is <b>an</b> honest mess, <b>with</b> real passion and no-holds-barred faith-filled lyrics, but unfortunately a sub-par performance."

25|$|At {{this point}} Hick was {{averaging}} 53 in first-class cricket, but the 13 innings he played {{after his return}} in late July produced only 246 runs, leaving him with a season's average of just 33.50, his worst showing since the dark days of 1991. 2004, however, saw him return to form <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>vengeance,</b> his 1,589 first-class runs (at 63.56) his best aggregate since 1990 and the lowest of his four centuries being 158, and he was picked for the FICA World XI team in three one-day games against New Zealand in January 2005, these matches having List A but not ODI status.|$|E
25|$|Yardy {{made his}} Sussex debut in an early-season NatWest Trophy game against Hertfordshire in May 1999, {{although}} it was not a very successful way to begin his career: opening the batting, he was lbw for nought and went for 14 from two wicketless overs. He also played a one-day game against Sri Lanka A, again with little success, and though he played a few games the following year it was only in 2001 that he became anything like a regular in the side. He played ten games in 2002, but only seven in total over the next two years, before returning <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>vengeance</b> in 2005.|$|E
25|$|But {{the group}} bounced back <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>vengeance</b> with their 2nd album La Grasa de las Capitales. It was well {{received}} by the specialist press, and would cement their status as the most popular band of their time. Serú Girán's third album Bicicleta (1980) was tepidly received at first, but in time would be considered the band's best work. Both albums departed from the symphonic rock of the first LP, the music turning more visceral and 'simple' with less arrangement and pomp. Serú Girán would not be isolated in this trend, as slowly Argentine rock was writing the final chapters in its symphonic and progressive period.|$|E
50|$|Another {{focus of}} the season is Xander's {{relationship}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> former <b>vengeance</b> demon named Anya Jenkins, who becomes infatuated with him due to him making her feel human and Xander returns these feelings as she makes him feel like a man. Anya tries to get Xander off her mind but their feelings are developed and they begin a relationship.|$|R

25|$|After Unicorn Records {{declared}} bankruptcy, Black Flag {{were released}} from the injunction, and returned <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>vengeance,</b> starting {{with the release of}} My War. The album was both a continuation of Damaged, and a vast leap forward. While the general mood and lyrics continue in the confrontational and emotional tone of Damaged, the album would prove influential to grunge music as the decade progressed. Lacking a bass player, Ginn played bass guitar, using the pseudonym Dale Nixon. On the May 1, 2007 episode of his radio program Harmony in My Head, Rollins reported that one of Ginn's favorite albums during this era was Mahavishnu Orchestra's Birds of Fire (1973), and opined that John McLaughlin's guitar work influenced Ginn.|$|E
25|$|Kant {{himself did}} not see himself as a relativist, and was aiming to give {{knowledge}} a more solid basis, but as Richard J. Bernstein remarks, reviewing this same critique of Gadamer:Once we begin to question {{whether there is a}} common faculty of taste (a sensus communis), we are easily led down the path to relativism. And this is what did happen after Kant - so much so that today it is extraordinarily difficult to retrieve any idea of taste or aesthetic judgment that is more than the expression of personal preferences. Ironically (given Kant's intentions), the same tendency has worked itself out <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>vengeance</b> with regards to all judgments of value, including moral judgments.|$|E
25|$|Fitzpatrick {{began to}} {{distance}} himself from Foster when his membership in the Communist Party became public knowledge. Foster and the CP, on the other hand, had enough influence within the CFL to be able to dominate the founding convention with representatives of various organizations, some of them existing only on paper. When the CP appeared to have taken over this new party, Fitzpatrick walked out, leaving the CP with a stillborn organization. From that point forward Fitzpatrick campaigned against TUEL and the AFL began expelling communists from its ranks <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>vengeance.</b> The Party likewise split the Minnesota-Farmer Labor Party and repudiated any common work with La Follette. After a disastrous showing in the 1924 elections, the Party dismantled the Federated Farmer-Labor Party it had created.|$|E

25|$|Fleury {{returned}} to the net after the lock-out season <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>vengeance,</b> putting {{some of the best}} marks of his career in the shortened season. He finished with a record of 23–8, tying him for fourth in the league, while his save percentage and goals against average continued to place him in the top half of starting goaltenders. His playoff troubles continued, however; after posting a shutout in his playoff game, he was less than impressive in following starts, leaving backup Tomáš Vokoun to start {{for the remainder of the}} 2013 playoffs. The Penguins promising 2012–13 season ended abruptly with a 4–0 loss to the Boston Bruins in the Eastern Conference Finals. After the season, however, Penguins officials confirmed that Fleury remained the team's starting goaltender.|$|E
25|$|Wooden's team {{repeated}} {{as national}} champions in 1965 with Gail Goodrich, Kenny Washington, and Doug McIntosh, when the Bruins upended Dave Strack's Michigan team 91–80 in the final. Goodrich shared Player of the Year honors with Princeton's Bill Bradley. The 1966 squad was denied {{a chance at}} a triple crown, finishing second to Oregon State in the Athletic Association of Western Universities (now the Pac-12). UCLA was ineligible to play in the NCAA tournament that year, because in those days only conference champions were guaranteed a bid to the tournament. The Bruins' 1967 incarnation returned <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>vengeance</b> with sophomore star Alcindor, reclaiming not only the conference title, but the national crown with another 30–0 season, and then retaining it every season but one until Wooden's retirement immediately following the 1975 NCAA championship.|$|E

The Revs were ousted early in the 2008 playoffs, but were back <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>vengeance</b> in 2010 when they won the Atlantic League Championship, the first professional baseball title the city had won since the 1969 York Pirates of the Eastern League. The Revs took home the trophy again in 2011, winning back-to-back championships and becoming just the second team in league history to accomplish the feat.

[...] About the character of Paula, Shriver deplores that the [...] "apologetic, alternatingly gushy and beseeching style seems artificially female—like a man's idea of a woman's voice. This is disconcerting, since Swift has crafted persuasive female characters before. But Paula is female <b>with</b> such <b>a</b> <b>vengeance</b> that she borders on parody. This woman is dull, trying, and signally incapable of ponying up the sharp lines and insightful asides that make a novel enjoyable along the way. Maybe we should let her keep her secret." ...|$|R
