25|$|Across the world, it {{is common}} for people to sleep in the same bed as one another after copulation. Humans are {{more likely to engage in}} sexual {{activity}} at night, so therefore night-time brings the highest danger of infidelity. Due to females investing more in the relationship (Parental investment), women therefore receive more benefits from sleeping with their mate during the night. Keeping close proximity with a partner acts as a mate guarding technique as it minimises the likelihood of unfaithfulness by the male, and also assures their partner of her fidelity. As a result of the paternal confidence, the male is also more likely to stay and provide resources. In one study it was found that 73.7% of participants said that females are more likely to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> together after sexual intercourse. Mate guarding is a very likely explanation to this, but it may also have the benefits of increasing the female's protection, potentially from male poachers.|$|E

The New York Times later reported that [...] "in some ways, [...] was happy" [...] for the magazine's error, and quoted him as saying, [...] "I feel very lucky about all of that. It really opened up a new readership to me, and a very loyal one." [...] In a 2002 interview, Chabon added, [...] "If Mysteries of Pittsburgh is about anything {{in terms of human}} sexuality and identity, it's that people can't be put into categories all that easily." [...] In [...] "On The Mysteries of Pittsburgh," [...] an essay he wrote for the New York Review of Books in 2005, Chabon remarked on the autobiographical events that helped inspire his first novel: [...] "I had slept with one man whom I loved, and learned to love another man so much that it would never have occurred to me to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> with him." ...|$|E

So when he says it, she considers her options, weighs them up." ...|$|E

2500|$|With {{regard to}} {{relationships}} and her sexuality, Fox {{said that she}} has a general distrust and dislike of men, and that the perception of her as a [...] "wild and crazy sexpot" [...] is false because she is asocial and has only been sexually intimate with her [...] "childhood sweetheart" [...] and Brian Austin Green; she stated that she would rather stay at home instead of going out, and emphasized that she cannot have sex with someone she does not love. She is bisexual, and said she believes that [...] "all humans are born with the ability to be attracted to both sexes". [...] "I have {{no question in my mind}} about being bisexual," [...] Fox stated.

2500|$|In 2004 Michael said [...] "I used {{to sleep}} with women quite {{a lot in the}} Wham! days but never felt it could develop into a {{relationship}} because I knew that, emotionally, I was a gay man. I didn't want to commit to them but I was attracted to them. Then I became ashamed that I might be using them. I decided I had to stop, which I did when I began to worry about AIDS, which was becoming prevalent in Britain. Although I had always had safe sex, I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> with a woman without telling her I was bisexual. I felt that would be irresponsible. Basically, I didn't want to have that uncomfortable conversation that might ruin the moment, so I stopped sleeping with them." [...] In the same interview, he added : [...] "If I wasn't with Kenny , I would have sex with women, no question". He said he believed that the formation of his sexuality was [...] "a nurture thing, via the absence of my father who was always busy working. It meant I was exceptionally close to my mother", though he stated that [...] "there are definitely those who have a predisposition to being gay in which the environment is irrelevant." ...|$|E
