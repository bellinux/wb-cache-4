5|$|Each {{district}} has fashion trends that affect gameplay. By wearing pins or clothing {{from the more}} popular brands in that district, items' effects will be improved; wearing the least fashionable items <b>will</b> <b>do</b> the opposite, and items from brands in between are not affected. However, the player can increase a brand's popularity in one district by repeatedly fighting battles in that district while wearing items of that brand. The player can enter shops to buy new pins, clothes, and food items that are gradually consumed during battles to improve the characters' basic attributes.|$|E
5|$|First the {{machines}} <b>will</b> <b>do</b> {{a lot of}} jobs for us and not be super intelligent. That should be positive if we manage it well. A few decades after that though the intelligence is strong enough to be a concern. I agree with Elon Musk and some others on this and don't understand why some people are not concerned.|$|E
5|$|IQ classifications from IQ testing are not {{the last}} word on how a test-taker <b>will</b> <b>do</b> in life, nor are they the only {{information}} to be considered for placement in school or job-training programs. There is still a dearth of information about how behavior differs between persons with differing IQ scores. For placement in school programs, for medical diagnosis, and for career advising, factors other than IQ must also be part of an individual assessment.|$|E

5|$|The {{black stork}} has {{a wider range}} of calls than the white stork, its main call being a chee leee, which sounds like a loud inhalation. It makes a hissing call as a warning or threat. Displaying males produce a long series of wheezy raptor-like {{squealing}} calls rising in volume and then falling. It rarely indulges in mutual bill-clattering when adults meet at the nest. Adults <b>will</b> <b>do</b> so as part of their mating ritual or when angered. The young clatter their bills when aroused.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the first}} {{programme}} to allow the public to cast {{a leading role in}} a West End show, and it was initially criticised.

The series also led to versions and similar series abroad.|$|E

5|$|Cockfighting {{is said to}} be the world's oldest spectator {{sport and}} may have {{originated}} in Persia 6,000 years ago. Two mature males (cocks or roosters) are set to fight each other, and <b>will</b> <b>do</b> so with great vigour until one is critically injured or killed. Breeds such as the Aseel were developed in the Indian subcontinent for their aggressive behaviour. The sport formed part of the culture of the ancient Indians, Chinese, Greeks, and Romans, and large sums were won or lost depending on the outcome of an encounter. Cockfighting has been banned in many countries during the last century on the grounds of cruelty to animals.|$|E
5|$|In God, Power and Evil: A Process Theodicy, {{published}} in 1976, David Ray Griffin criticised Augustine's reliance on free will {{and argued that}} it is incompatible with divine omniscience and omnipotence. Griffin argued in later works that humans cannot have free will if God is omniscient. He contented that, if God is truly omniscient, then he will know infallibly what people <b>will</b> <b>do,</b> meaning that they cannot be free. Griffin argued that the human will could not oppose God's will, if God is omnipotent. He proposed that original sin as Augustine conceived it must itself be caused by God, rendering any punishment he wills unjust.|$|E
5|$|The {{real issue}} is that it moves the moral center more towards the obscene. That it becomes more normal to be more sexually promiscuous, because they are bombarded with imagery that is loaded with innuendo, and that is seen as normal, even preferred... if girls and women find their {{identity}} and self-worth in the approval of people, they <b>will</b> <b>do</b> {{whatever it takes to}} become popular and loved. When stars like Rihanna, who blast sexuality, are thrust into the limelight, girls tend to think that is the way for them to be valuable. God tells us that we are fearfully and wonderfully made... bearing His image. Rihanna is selling a lie.|$|E
