2500|$|The {{enabling}} legislation {{passed by the}} legislature was carefully constructed to avoid clashes {{if at all possible}} and to create an aura of legality in the process. To avoid conflicts with Unionists, it allowed importers to pay the tariff if they so desired. Other merchants could pay the tariff by obtaining a paper tariff bond from the customs officer. They would then refuse to pay the bond when due, and if the customs official seized the goods, the merchant would file for a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> <b>replevin</b> to recover the goods in state court. Customs officials who refused to return the goods (by placing them under the protection of federal troops) would be civilly liable for twice the value of the goods.

According to the abolitionist paper the Liberator, Shaw said that it was a federal matter and the Constitution and the laws of Congress “were to be obeyed, however disagreeable to our natural sympathies or views of duty.” ...|$|R

50|$|In many cases, parties {{initiating}} a replevin action will elect not to gain immediate {{possession of the}} collateral or other wrongfully-held property and will instead file the replevin action without posting a bond. Once service of process is achieved, the defendant will likely be required to attend a court hearing on a specific date, then the parties' rights to possession will be adjudicated. A plaintiff creditor can typically prevail in the case by offering testimony and business records showing the borrower/defendant's obligation to pay, and default in payment. The Court will thereafter issue a judgment and authorize issuance of a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> <b>replevin,</b> which is served by a sheriff's deputy, working in conjunction with persons hired or employed by the creditor to take the collateral or other property into its possession.

40|$|Plaintiff {{insurance}} company paid {{the owner of}} a stolen automobile full value for his loss, and received in return the certificate of title with a proper assignment thereon. Later, having found the automobile in the possession of the defendant, a purchaser from a thief, plaintiff sued out a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> <b>replevin</b> without first obtaining a new certificate of title in its own name. Held: because of his failure to obtain a new certificate of title in his own name, the plaintiff failed to sustain the burden of proving ownership in a replevin action. It is a well-established rule of law that the plaintiff in a replevin action must bring the action on the strength of his own title, prior possession or right to possession. Here, because the plaintiff had failed to apply for a new certificate of title “within three days after delivery” of the automobile as required by Nebraska statute, the defendant was able to prove that title remained in the original owner...|$|E
