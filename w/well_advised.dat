25|$|Cultural {{differences}} between Muslim majority Turkey and predominantly Christian majority Europe {{play an important}} part in the entire debate on Turkish accession to the European Union. In an analysis, based on the World Values Survey, the social scientists Arno Tausch and Almas Heshmati {{came to the conclusion that}} a robust measurement scale of global economic, political and social values and Turkey's place on them wields only a very qualified picture of Turkey's place on the maps of global values. The study, which is based on 92,289 representative individuals with complete data in 68 countries, representing 56.89% of the global population, looks at hard-core economic values in the countries concerned. From nine dimensions for the determination of the geography of human values, based on a promax factor analysis of the available data, six factor analytical scores to calculate a new Global Value Development Index were used, which combines: avoiding economic permissiveness; avoiding racism; avoiding distrust of the army and the press; avoiding the authoritarian character; tolerance and respect; and avoiding the rejection of the market economy and democracy. Turkey is ranked 25, ahead of several EU member countries. But there are still considerable deficits concerning the liberal values components, which are very important for an effective democracy. The deficits, the study argues, suggest that the Turkish state, Turkish civil society and European decision makers would be <b>well</b> <b>advised</b> to continue to support civil society and secular democracy in Turkey.|$|E

500|$|There is some {{diversity}} of opinion {{as to the}} origin of the names Pleione and Pleiades. There are three possible derivations of note. Foremost is that both names come from the Greek word πλεῖν, (pr. ple'-ō), meaning [...] "to sail". This is particularly plausible given that ancient Greece was a seafaring culture and because of Pleione's mythical status as an Oceanid nymph. Pleione, as a result, is sometimes referred to as the [...] "sailing queen" [...] while her daughters the [...] "sailing ones". Also, the appearance of these stars coincided with the sailing season in antiquity; sailors were <b>well</b> <b>advised</b> to set sail only when the Pleiades were visible at night, lest they meet with misfortune.|$|E
500|$|Many Byzantines {{feared the}} Crusade, a view {{endorsed}} by the numerous acts of vandalism and theft practiced by the unruly armies as they marched through Byzantine territory. Byzantine troops followed the Crusaders, attempting to police their behaviour, and further troops were assembled in Constantinople, ready to defend the capital against any acts of aggression. This cautious approach was <b>well</b> <b>advised,</b> but still the numerous incidents of covert and open hostility between the Franks and the Greeks on their line of march, for which it seems both sides were to blame, [...] precipitated conflict between Manuel and his guests. Manuel took the precaution – which his grandfather had not taken – of making repairs to the city walls, and he pressed the two kings for guarantees concerning the security of his territories. Conrad's army {{was the first to}} enter the Byzantine territory in the summer of 1147, and it figures more prominently in the Byzantine sources, which imply that it was the more troublesome of the two. Indeed, the contemporary Byzantine historian Kinnamos describes a full-scale clash between a Byzantine force and part of Conrad's army, outside the walls of Constantinople. The Byzantines defeated the Germans and, in Byzantine eyes, this reverse caused Conrad to agree to have his army speedily ferried across to Damalis on the Asian shore of the Bosphoros.|$|E

As late as Spring 2010 he was still unknown, but began to be noticed in mid April. In late April, Syracuse offered him a scholarship. That spring NBA Top 100 Camp Director Dave Telep, invited him to the camp based on his dominant first half performance of {{the first game of the}} Fort Wayne, Indiana Spiece Fieldhouse event.
