5|$|Bruce's {{earnings}} from his offices {{had made him}} a <b>wealthy</b> <b>man,</b> even {{by the standards of}} his patrons. This wealth allowed him to purchase the Balcaskie estate in 1665, and to extend the house and gardens. In 1675 he purchased the larger estate of Loch Leven, Kinross, from the Earl of Morton, which brought him the hereditary sheriffdom of Kinross-shire. In the late 1670s Bruce took on his first architectural projects for entirely new houses.|$|E

5|$|He {{returned}} to Sweden in 1768, a <b>wealthy</b> <b>man</b> and lived {{the rest of}} his life in Swedish high society, writing minor essays about his travels as member of the Royal Swedish Academies of Sciences and Music. He married Lovisa Ulrika Lüning and bought the Godegård Manor and several ironworks, which he renovated and improved. When Grill died in 1792, his wife took over his business and ran the ironworks and factories.|$|E

40|$|Many {{observers}} believe that <b>wealthy</b> <b>men</b> play a disproportionate {{role in the}} continuing spread of HIV/AIDS infection in sub-Saharan Africa through their involvement in informal exchange relationships, where money and gifts (referred to as “transfers”) are given {{to a range of}} nonmarital sexual partners. In this case, <b>wealthier</b> <b>men</b> are riskier sexual partners because they can afford to give larger transfers, which {{have been found to be}} negatively associated with condom use. Alternatively, <b>wealthier</b> <b>men</b> might have greater incentives to practice safe sex at later stages of the epidemic, or <b>wealthier</b> <b>men</b> might match with female partners who have particularly strong preferences for condom use. Accordingly, economic status would be positively associated with condom use. I use survey data from urban Kisumu, Kenya, to investigate the various mechanisms through which economic status is associated with sexual risk behavior. My results show that wealth is positively associated with transfers; however, wealth is uncorrelated with condom use. The characteristics of wealthier men’s female partners also do not differ from the characteristics of poorer men’s partners. I conclude that <b>wealthier</b> <b>men</b> have stronger preferences for condom use, which offsets the negative effect of larger transfers that they give to their sexual partners. ...|$|R

5|$|Castle Acre Castle {{was built}} by William de Warenne, the Earl of Surrey, in the manor of Acre during the 1070s. William was a Norman lord who had {{accompanied}} William the Conqueror in the conquest of England in 1066; he was rewarded with extensive estates across England. Acre was already an Anglo-Saxon estate centre {{and at the time}} of the invasion was owned by a <b>wealthy</b> <b>man</b> called Toki, but he was quickly replaced by Frederick, a Flemish lord and William's brother-in-law. When Frederick died around 1070, William acquired control of the manor, which formed part of his massive land holdings across the region.|$|E
5|$|Gundamma {{is a rich}} widow who ill-treats her {{stepdaughter}} Lakshmi, a selfless {{person who}} is reduced to working as a maid. Gundamma has a daughter Saroja and a son Prabhakar. Prabhakar {{is in love with}} Saroja's friend Padma. Gundamma has a half-brother Ghantaiah, a cunning but weak milk vendor. Ghantaiah wants Gundamma to marry off Saroja to his criminal son Bhoopati. To achieve this goal without the knowledge of Gundamma, he spoils every marriage proposal Saroja receives. Saroja's arrogance and Lakshmi's courteous attitude indirectly help Ghantaiah. Gundamma decides to marry off Lakshmi to a vagabond and Saroja to the son of Ramabhadraiah, a <b>wealthy</b> <b>man</b> living in a faraway town.|$|E
5|$|In 1599, a {{partnership}} {{of members of}} the company built their own theatre on the south bank of the River Thames, which they named the Globe. In 1608, the partnership also took over the Blackfriars indoor theatre. Extant records of Shakespeare's property purchases and investments indicate that his association with the company made him a <b>wealthy</b> <b>man,</b> and in 1597, he bought the second-largest house in Stratford, New Place, and in 1605, invested in a share of the parish tithes in Stratford.|$|E

5|$|After {{years of}} frustration, Honório Hermeto (or Paraná as he became known) had largely recouped the {{prestige}} he had formerly possessed among his peers. He had liquidated his uncle's domestic slave trading business {{and used the}} proceeds to become a coffee plantation owner in 1836. The land he acquired was located in the hills between Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais. Although Paraná staunchly opposed {{the abolition of the}} transatlantic African slave trade, the importation of slaves was abolished in 1850 by the Eusébio de Queirós Law. The ban on slave imports seems to have had no impact over Paraná's private affairs; by 1852, he had become a very <b>wealthy</b> <b>man.</b> He also married his son Honório to a niece of Rodrigues Torres, thus establishing a link between his family and the province of Rio de Janeiro's planter aristocracy.|$|E
5|$|Anthony {{passed on}} both the castle and a {{considerable}} fortune to his son, yet another Sir Edward Hungerford, in 1657. After his marriage, Edward enjoyed an income of around £8,000 (£1,110,000) a year, making him a very <b>wealthy</b> <b>man.</b> Edward lived a lavish lifestyle, however, including giving a huge gift of money to the exiled Charles II shortly before his restoration to the throne, and later entertaining the royal court at Farleigh Hungerford Castle in 1673. Edward later fell out with the king over the proposal that the Roman Catholic James II should succeed to the throne on Charles's death, and after {{the discovery of the}} Rye House Plot in 1683 the castle was searched by royal officials looking for stocks of weapons that might be used in a possible revolt.|$|E
5|$|At {{its height}} {{during the period}} of Ravalomanana's presidency, Tiko {{provided}} direct salaried employment to between 1,000 and 3,000 staff and indirect employment to over 10,000. The group was the largest dairy producer in the country and a leader in the national agribusiness sector. The success of his enterprises made Ravalomanana a <b>wealthy</b> <b>man.</b> In the mandatory self-disclosure of wealth submitted to the High Constitutional Court in 2000 by all presidential candidates, Ravalomanana declared ownership of 27 properties valued at over two billion Malagasy francs. He owned 90 per cent of Tiko Inc., 80 per cent of Tiko Agri and 50 per cent of Tiko Oil Products, a portfolio worth 13.1 billion Malagasy francs, and declared 77 million Malagasy francs in annual revenues. Vivier (2007) demonstrates that the valuation of Ravalomanana's holdings and his annual revenue in particular were significantly underestimated.|$|E

5|$|In 1606 Adam Mort {{bought the}} manor house and land in Astley. He was a <b>wealthy</b> <b>man</b> {{who built the}} first Astley Chapel as a chapel of ease for the parish church in Leigh. The chapel was consecrated in 1631, the year that he died. He built a grammar school that stood for over 200years until 1833, when it was {{demolished}} and rebuilt. Adam Mort's grandson, also Adam, rebuilt Damhouse in 1650 and his initials are carved in the plaque over the front door. The stone and timber structure was named from the stream which was dammed to supply water to a waterwheel powering a corn mill near the house. It is possible the hall was once surrounded by a moat.|$|E
5|$|In 1858, he {{accepted}} a teaching {{position at the}} ICY's preparatory school for boys. White furthered his interests in mathematics during his teaching stint at the institute. He became a lecturer on the subject while {{a member of the}} mathematics committee of the Banneker Institute, also becoming a proficient chess player in his leisure time. His exceptional skills with figures and calculations led to different business ventures: he was an agent for the Anglo-African weekly newspaper (1860–1861) and Pine and Palm (1860–1862). In 1861, he became a representative at the Haitian Bureau of Emigration, empowering him with the transfers of funds for free blacks who sought to move to Haiti, via New York. As a result of his different ventures, White became a relatively <b>wealthy</b> <b>man</b> at a young age.|$|E
5|$|In October 1929, {{the firm}} {{completed}} a huge grain elevator, with capacity of 7,000,000 bushels (246,670 cubic meters), at Port Arthur. The Depression, however, devastated the grain industry, with falling prices and little demand for exported grain. There was no {{demand for more}} grain elevators, as the existing elevators contained unsold grain, further driving prices down. Howe's company managed to survive on pre-existing government contracts, but these eventually expired and the staff of 175 had decreased to five by 1933. On the first business day of 1934, Howe's sole remaining partner resigned from the firm. Although Howe remained a <b>wealthy</b> <b>man,</b> his business prospects were few, {{and he decided to}} seek another line of work.|$|E
