30|$|Test-takers with a {{high level}} of test {{motivation}} exhibit more effort to answer questions correctly and thoroughly and demonstrate more commitment to completing all test items than test-takers with lower levels of test motivation (Baumert and Demmrich 2001). Consequently, ambiguities arise in the interpretation of test scores: It is unclear whether performance on a test is the result of having the necessary ability and/or the result of (missing) test motivation. Hence, misinterpretation of test scores may occur when influence factors are not considered or misidentified (Wise and DeMars 2005). For example, it is difficult to determine whether test items are ignored due to a low level of test motivation alone or whether other factors are at play and whether responses to test items are mere guesses <b>without</b> <b>any</b> <b>significant</b> <b>effort</b> being made (Knekta 2017).|$|R
40|$|Formally {{institutionalized}} party {{organization is}} usually considered {{a prerequisite for}} the development of programmatic linkages between parties and voters. However, this paper shows that political parties in South Korea have succeeded in stabilizing interparty competition through programmatic linkages <b>without</b> making <b>any</b> <b>significant</b> <b>efforts</b> to build a formal organizational base. In fact, {{it could be argued that}} Korea is a “partyless” democracy, as political parties get easily captured by the interests of ambitious politicians, thus failing to establish themselves as independent actors. The paper therefore makes a more general argument about the concept of party system institutionalization: We need to rethink the current practice of aggregating the different attributes of party system institutionalization into a single scale, as these attributes do not seem to be connected in a linear fashion...|$|R
