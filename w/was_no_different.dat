5|$|The {{area around}} Goodison Park when built was a dense area full of terraced housing, and Goodison Avenue behind the Park End stand <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>different.</b> Oddly housing was built {{right into the}} stand itself (as shown on old {{photographs}} of Goodison and in programmes). The club had previously owned many of the houses {{on the road and}} rented them to players. One of the players to live there, Dixie Dean later had a statue erected in his honour near the Park End on Walton Lane.|$|E
5|$|Historian David Detzer {{has argued}} that the fame that {{surrounds}} the 11th New York is misplaced. During its time in service, the 11th New York Regiment saw little fighting compared to other well-known regiments such as the 69th New York, 20th Maine, and 28th Massachusetts. The 11th New York was often overshadowed by the 73rd New York, also known as the Second Fire Zouaves, which fought at Antietam, Gettysburg, and Appomattox. In addition, Ellsworth failed to consider that the New York City fire companies from which his troops were drawn often competed against each other at blazes. The cohesion he sought in firefighters did not exist and would not be created when they joined the regiment. In that respect, 11th New York <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>different</b> than many regiments, North and South.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Congress {{passed the}} Line Item Veto Act, which allowed the {{president}} to cancel items from an appropriations bill (a bill authorizing spending) once passed into law. The statute was challenged the following year. The matter rapidly reached the Supreme Court, which struck down the law as violating the Presentment Clause of the Constitution, which governs {{what the president is}} permitted to do with a bill once it has passed both houses of Congress. Scalia dissented, seeing no Presentment Clause difficulties and feeling that the act did not violate separation of powers. Scalia indicated he felt that authorizing {{the president to}} cancel an appropriation <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>different</b> from allowing him to spend an appropriation at his discretion, which had long been accepted as constitutional.|$|E

5|$|Just as {{the first}} half was {{dominated}} by both defenses, the second <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>different</b> with both Alabama and LSU only managing a pair of field goals. Alabama's came in the third on a 46-yard Cade Foster score and LSU's came in the fourth on a 30-yard Alleman score. In the overtime period, Foster missed a 52-yard field goal attempt and Alleman connected on a 25-yard attempt to give the Tigers the 9–6 victory. Both defenses held each offense to less than 300 yards of total offense with each having a pair of interceptions. With the loss, Alabama dropped to 4–8 all-time in overtime games and brought Alabama's all-time record against the Tigers to 45–25–5.|$|E
5|$|The Restoration, {{along with}} {{a return to the}} pre-war Laudian church and the passing of the Act of Uniformity in 1662, posed few {{problems}} for the sympathetic and quickly reformed Brasenose; only one fellow left without agreeing. For some, nominal allegiance to the new regime was the order of the day, supported by a weary college. The Restoration period was one of disciplinary laxity across the university; Brasenose <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>different,</b> with some of its students taking part in riots. Yate was instituted as successor – and somewhat retrospectively as predecessor – to Greenwood; six of the thirteen fellows that had been expelled returned; other personnel in the college were replaced. The period saw a rejuvenation of teaching in the University as a whole and a new cache of new thinkers, including Brasenose's Petty.|$|E
5|$|The lawyers {{argued the}} case before the Appellate Division in Brooklyn on October 21, 1927. On December 9, the Appellate Division affirmed the trial court's judgment, 3–2. Albert H. F. Seeger wrote the {{majority}} opinion for the five justices hearing the case, and was joined by Justices William F. Hagarty and William B. Carswell. Seeger {{had been born in}} Stuttgart and came to the United States as a child; he had been elected to the Supreme Court in 1917 and was elevated to the Appellate Division by Governor Al Smith in 1926. Aged 68 at the time of Palsgraf, he could serve only two more years before mandatory retirement. Justice Seeger ruled that the finding of negligence by the jury was supported by the evidence, and speculated that the jury might have found that helping a passenger board a moving train was a negligent act. He wrote that while the set of facts might be novel, the case <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>different</b> in principle from well-known court decisions on causation, such as the Squib case, in which an explosive (a squib) was lit and thrown, then was hurled away repeatedly by people not wanting to be hurt until it exploded near the plaintiff, injuring him; his suit against the man who had set the squib in motion was upheld. The majority also focused on the high degree of duty of care that the LIRR owed to Palsgraf, one of its customers.|$|E

The initial number of officers and {{men for the}} PCs commissioned by the United States Navy was almost 24,000, yet a total of 50,000 actually served due to transfers, hospitalizations, etc. PC-552 <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>different.</b>|$|E
25|$|Though aided immensely by the Angevins, {{the lords}} of Montferrat {{had never been}} known for loyalty to a cause or party and William <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>different,</b> abandoning Charles soon after his success, {{probably}} fearful of the king's rising power in northern Italy and of being encircled by an Angevin state.|$|E
25|$|Many college traditions have {{disappeared}} and been forgotten, {{much to the}} chagrin of most alumni.

Marriage is not distinguished from birth, except for the names of sons- and daughters-in-law, and the terminology treats relatives through marriage to <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>different</b> from relatives through birth.|$|R

25|$|Thiele and Ladiges' {{arrangement}} remained current {{only until}} 1999, when George's {{treatment of the}} genus for the Flora of Australia series of monographs was published. This was essentially a revision of George's 1981 arrangement, which took into account some of Thiele and Ladiges' data, but rejected their overall arrangement. With respect to B.ser.

25|$|It further {{indicates}} that Braham was {{very conscious of}} his market, more so than he was for the purity of his art.

However similar arguments against other musicians of Jewish origin were however also later to be given specific anti-Jewish spins in continental Europe.|$|E
25|$|It {{has also}} been argued that level of detail used in the {{narrative}} describing Paul's travels suggests an eyewitness source. In 1882 Hobart claimed that the vocabulary used in Luke-Acts suggests its author may have had medical training, but this assertion was challenged by an influential study by Cadbury in 1926 that argued Luke's medical terminology <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>different</b> than terminology used by other non physician authors such as Plutarch.|$|E

25|$|By the early/mid-1990s, some of McTavish's {{storytelling}} received {{criticism for}} being gimmick-driven (i.e. multiple dual roles, bomb plots). Reports soon surfaced that Behr and McTavish were having conflicts about storylines {{and the direction}} of the series. After the O.J. Simpson trial preempted daytime television programs throughout late 1994 and into 1995, many soaps saw their ratings decline, and All My Children <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>different.</b> When Megan McTavish was fired from her head writing post in the spring, former head writer Lorraine Broderick was tapped by Behr to lead the team once again.|$|E
