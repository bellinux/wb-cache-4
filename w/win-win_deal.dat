40|$|In {{the context}} of a current project at Carleton University to create {{creating}} a deal-making platform, this article presents the results of a recent review of the literature to determine: What is a good deal? This is question is asked {{from the perspective of the}} stakeholders in the development of a software-based collaboration tool that is designed to help streamline deal development between members. The stakeholders include the creators, the users, and the investors. We answer this question by examining several streams in the literature, all centered on understanding deals and deal-making processes. These streams explore the concept of a <b>win-win</b> <b>deal,</b> how value may be seen differently, and the group processes involved in deal making. A key contribution from this review suggests that deal goodness can be separated based on a Me-We construct: the impact to each and every stakeholder of the deal and the impact to the entire collective (not just the deal stakeholders). This implies one can separate the platform management problem into actor-centric (Me) and linkage-centric (We) domains. This is consistent with the notion of players balancing their self interest with the other stakeholders in the deal (Me-We). This is also consistent with the prospect of managing ecosystem health based on player and network-based metrics...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} few months, I have {{embarked}} upon a plan to reduce my electrical & gas energy consumption. I must admit that I was already thinking of doing so {{in the face of}} a very high energy bill after Christmas, but the requirements for this essay meant that I could combine saving money with getting coursework done which seems like a <b>win‐win</b> <b>deal.</b> This essay summarises my progress, the realisations that I have made and how hidden energy consumption is so easy to miss. Background Like most people, unless it affects me in the pocket with a “wow ” factor (as in, “wow that’s more expensive than I thought”), I don’t much consider how I consume energy. Sure, one knows that a disposable plastic bottle requires however many kilograms of fossil fuels, or a glass bottle so many kilojoules for processing & transporting the silica, but one does not realise just how much they are or indeed how important (or not) such a consumption might be. After all, consuming a lot of renewable energy might even be worse in the big picture than a small amount of non‐ renewable energy, but our price mechanism does not show any of the “back story”. I did however get “wowed ” with our first electricity & gas bill from Scottish Gas, especially with historically high energy prices thanks mostly due to deregulation of the energy market in the UK. We, like most students, live in rented accommodation and so cannot change our utilities provider nor make structural improvements to our hous...|$|E
40|$|This {{internship}} {{report is}} submitted in a partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Business Administration, 2006. Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 66). Electronic goods/appliances market in Bangladesh has an outstanding potentiality to grow. In domestic or households sector the electronic appliances has become a need rather than a want. With the acceleration of economic activities, the investment from local and abroad has enhanced greatly. As a result the number of business entities has increased to a great extent. Here TEL (Transcom Electronics Limited) comes to play with its products for business purpose. TEL's Institution Business Department is dedicated to those business house's needs for electronic appliances. TEL is operating in many different industries and serving different clients. These clients of corporate arena deserve some different treatment {{than that of the}} households. They are bulk buyers and demand for an extra something that will create a <b>Win-Win</b> <b>deal</b> for the both of the parties. Now, business houses buy electronics products for two basic reasons. One is for trade promotion. That counts consumer promotion campaign and dealer promotion both. The other one is for office, factory or other infrastructure facility use. When they buy it for trade promotion specially consumer promotion their motive is different than that of the office purpose purchase. Some cases they are extremely brand loyal, and to some cases they look for the cheapest product in the market. Thus it is a large growing market of more than five thousand crores taka. The evidence of economic performance shows that it could grow up to thousand crore by the next decade. A. R. M Ridwanul KarimB. Business Administratio...|$|E

40|$|Urban renewal in the Netherlands {{has become}} a matter of ‘networking’. Housing associations, Dutch social landlords, became financially {{independent}} in the 1990 s and have a responsibility in urban renewal. It is a joint responsibility in which local authority, social landlord and tenants are dependent on each other. This situation is rather new and needs some getting used to, as the two case studies show. The paper concludes that taking account of the complexity of networks could improve the chances of gaining support for problem definitions and solutions. This would result in agreement about goals and <b>win–win</b> package <b>deals</b> for actors, and ultimately in ‘more’ progress in urban renewal. OTB Research Institut...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} probe Africa 2 ̆ 7 s and China’s {{historical}} trajectory regarding economic development. It analyzes China 2 ̆ 7 s and Africa 2 ̆ 7 s creative leap, {{particularly since the}} millennium, into a new paradigm, {{a new way of}} economic relationship totally different from that with the West. The focus is on analyzing China’s heavy economic investment in Africa {{based on the assumption that}} the relationship is mutually beneficial rather than being exploitative as some scholars suggest. The hypothesis draws from Decision Theory’s concept of a Zero-Sum Game. It is understood that in a two partnered non-zero sum game theory, one partner’s gain or loss does not necessarily result in the other partner’s loss or gain. In other words, a non-zero-sum game depicts the winnings and losses of all partners as not adding up to zero but rather as a <b>win-win</b> <b>deal</b> for both. The same scenario explains China’s heavy involvement in contemporary African economic development and the latter’s ready acceptance of the Middle Kingdom’s gargantuan investment ventures in Sub-Sahara Africa that pales those of former colonial countries and all highly developed democratic regimes of the West. This paper provides data for Chinese investment in Africa and its concomitant spinoffs for both stake holders. It highlights the economic development gains in Sub-Sahara Africa since the millennium, how much of it was spawned by China’s heavy investment, and what China expects in return. It also draws attention to great power rivalries that have ruffled the feathers of former colonial powers and other Western countries that construe the entire enterprise as a Sino-imperialist venture. The paper then tries to fetter out the cost-benefit to both partners in terms of Chinese investment in contrast to Beijing’s dire need for Africa’s abundant natural resources to keep running its unprecedented growth that has already made it the largest global economy purchasing power parity (ppp) wise, surpassing what had been hitherto an unchallenged economic powerhouse, the United States of America...|$|E
40|$|After {{years of}} {{multiple}} crises, the EU 27 should re-energise the European project. This third NPE report, {{which is the}} culmination of five years of work reflecting more than 120 national and transnational debates throughout Europe, argues that the EU 27 should have the political will and courage to agree on an ambitious but realistic <b>win-win</b> package <b>deal</b> to overcome deadlocks and counter the danger of a more regressive, nationalistic, closed, illiberal and authoritarian Europe, the greatest challenge we are currently facing. The New Pact for Europe (NPE) initiative – launched in 2013 and steered by the King Baudouin Foundation, Bertelsmann Stiftung, Open Society Initiative for Europe and the European Policy Centre, supported by Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, Open Estonia Foundation, the BMW Foundation and the Network of European Foundations – aims to rebuild trust through national and transnational dialogue and develop new common ground on the way forward for the European Union...|$|R
