5|$|Writing {{about life}} in Victorian Cambridge, Gwen Raverat (granddaughter of Charles Darwin) {{describes}} the 'sport' of Stinkhorn hunting: In our native woods there grows a kind of toadstool, called in the vernacular The Stinkhorn, though in Latin it bears a grosser name. The name is justified, for the fungus can be hunted by the scent alone; and this was Aunt Etty's great invention. Armed with a basket and a pointed stick, and wearing special hunting cloak and gloves, she would sniff her way round the wood, pausing here and there, her nostrils twitching, when she {{caught a whiff of}} her prey; then at last, with a deadly pounce, she would fall upon her victim, and poke his putrid carcass into her basket. At the end of the day's sport, the catch was brought back and burnt in the deepest secrecy on the drawing-room fire, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> locked; because of the morals of the maids.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} evaluates whether lifting <b>the</b> trawl <b>doors</b> and sweeps from the seabed can reduce bycatch in shrimp trawl fisheries. We {{carried out a}} catch {{comparison}} and catch ratio analysis between two gear setups, one <b>with</b> <b>the</b> trawl <b>doors</b> and sweeps at the seabed (the traditional way) and <b>the</b> other <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> and sweeps lifted. The study was carried out on American plaice. The results showed that when fishing <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> and sweeps at the seabed, the gear is significantly more efficient at catching flatfish. <b>The</b> gear setup <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> and sweeps at the seabed captures between 50 % and 70 % more American plaice than <b>the</b> gear setup <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> and sweeps lifted. This difference is significant for sizes between 10 and 36 cm. Further, this efficiency is size dependent and increases <b>with</b> fish size. <b>The</b> results obtained are encouraging for the shrimp fishing industry as lifting <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> and sweeps from the seabed could help mitigate fish bycatch problems, and reduce bottom impact. Further studies are recommended to investigate if lifting <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> and sweeps from the seabed is equally efficient at reducing bycatch of other species, and if it also affects the shrimp catches...|$|R

After his left eardrum is ruptured by Beowulf, Grendel shrinks in size and attempts to escape.

25|$|Returning to Italy, {{the most}} celebrated doors {{are those of the}} Battistero di San Giovanni (Florence), which {{together}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> frames are all in bronze, the borders of the latter being perhaps the most remarkable: the modeling of the figures, birds and foliage of the south doorway, by Andrea Pisano (1330), and of the east doorway by Ghiberti (1425–1452), are of great beauty; in the north door (1402–1424) Ghiberti adopted the same scheme of design for the paneling and figure subjects in them as Andrea Pisano, but in the east door the rectangular panels are all filled, with bas-reliefs, in which Scripture subjects are illustrated with innumerable figures, these being probably the gates of Paradise of which Michelangelo speaks.|$|E

25|$|At {{the height}} of Hitchcock's success in 1956, he was also asked to {{introduce}} a set of books with his name attached. The series was {{a collection of short}} stories by popular short-story writers, primarily focused on suspense and thrillers. These titles included Alfred Hitchcock's Anthology, Alfred Hitchcock Presents: Stories to be Read <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Door</b> Locked, Alfred Hitchcock's Monster Museum, Alfred Hitchcock's Supernatural Tales of Terror and Suspense, Alfred Hitchcock's Spellbinders in Suspense, Alfred Hitchcock's Witch's Brew, Alfred Hitchcock's Ghostly Gallery, Alfred Hitchcock's A Hangman's Dozen, Alfred Hitchcock's Stories Not For the Nervous and Alfred Hitchcock's Haunted Houseful. Hitchcock himself was not actually involved in the reading, reviewing, editing or selection of the short stories. Some notable writers whose works were used in the collection include Shirley Jackson (Strangers in Town, The Lottery), T. H. White (The Once and Future King), Robert Bloch, H. G. Wells (The War of the Worlds), Robert Louis Stevenson, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Mark Twain and the creator of The Three Investigators, Robert Arthur. In a similar manner, Hitchcock's name was licensed for a digest-sized monthly, Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine, which has been published since 1956.|$|E

500|$|After Fram was {{anchored}} to ice in an inlet in the south-eastern {{corner of the}} Bay, Amundsen selected a site for the expedition's main hut, [...] from the ship. Six teams of dogs were used to move supplies to the site, as work on erecting the hut began. Bjaaland and Stubberud laid the foundations deep into the ice, levelling the sloping ground. Because the prevailing winds came from the east, the hut was erected on an east-west axis, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> facing west; {{in this way the}} wind caught only the shorter eastern wall. The roof was in place by 21January, and six days later the hut was complete. By then a large supply of meat—including 200seals—had been brought to the base, for use by the shore party and to be laid in depots before the journey to the pole.

Huskisson tried to clamber into the carriage, but those inside failed to reach him to pull him in. Holmes, still pressed against the carriage, shouted [...] "For God's sake, Mr Huskisson, be firm", but Huskisson grabbed the door of the carriage.

[...] Under its terms, the tribes ceded most {{of what is now}} Ohio for American settlement, recognized the United States (rather than Great Britain) as the ruling power in the region, and turned ten chiefs over to the U.S. government as hostages until all white prisoners were returned in guarantee. This, along with the recently signed Jay Treaty, which provided for the British withdrawal from pre-Revolutionary War forts in the region it had not yet relinquished, solidified U.S. sovereignty over the Northwest Territory.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, the thrall girl {{went from}} one tent {{to the other}} and had sexual {{intercourse}} with the men. Every man told her: [...] "Tell your master that I did this because of my love to him". In the afternoon, they moved the thrall girl to something that looked like a door frame, where she was lifted on the palms of the men three times. Every time, the girl told them what she saw. The first time, she saw her father and mother, the second time, she saw all her relatives, and the third time she saw her master in the afterworld. There, it was green and beautiful and together with him, she saw men and young boys. She saw that her master beckoned for her. By using intoxicating drinks, they thought to put the thrall girl in an ecstatic trance that made her psychic and through the symbolic action <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> frame, she would then see into the realm of the dead.
