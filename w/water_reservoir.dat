40|$|The Upper Silesian Agglomeration is {{the most}} industrialized area in Poland {{and one of the}} most in Europe. It is {{situated}} in the eastern part of the Upper Silesia and covers nearly 1500 km 2. This region is highly diverse in terms of the spatial structure. There are lots of <b>water</b> <b>reservoirs</b> besides built-up areas and industrial facilities. Many of them have also significance for nature. <b>Water</b> <b>reservoirs</b> in the Upper Silesian Agglomeration function under anthropogenic conditions. <b>Water</b> <b>reservoirs</b> have a different size and the genesis. This kind of occurrence conditions influences the water reservoirs` state. There are mainly <b>water</b> <b>reservoirs</b> of anthropogenic character in a study area. A lot of <b>water</b> <b>reservoirs</b> are strictly connected with coal exploitation in this region. Unfortunately, the number of <b>water</b> <b>reservoirs</b> in the cities of the Upper Silesian Agglomeration has lately decreased. Reservoirs are eliminated as a result of changes in industry, progressive land development, changes in environmental conditions. In this paper we present the results of the number of <b>water</b> <b>reservoirs</b> analysis in Katowice, Sosnowiec and Chorzów over the period 1993 - 2014. Field studies and analysis of topographic maps show a decrease in the number of <b>water</b> <b>reservoirs</b> in this region by tens of percent...|$|R

5|$|Birket Israel (trans. Pool of Israel) also Birket Israil or Birket Isra'in, {{abbreviated}} from Birket Asbât Beni Israìl (trans.

Along with his {{military}} decorations, he was honoured with a Gold Medal by the Aéro-Club de France, and a Bronze Medal and Diploma by the Aero Club of America. The town of Toogoolawah, Queensland, commemorated {{him in the}} name of its airport, and the national capital of Canberra remembered him with Dallas Place. His home town of Mount Morgan has dedicated a <b>water</b> <b>reservoir</b> in his honour; its Historical Society Museum holds his medals, uniform, and sword, as well the propeller from one of his planes.|$|E
5|$|Another pitfall trap form {{unrelated}} to the Sarraceniaceae family are the urns of bromeliad leaves that are formed when leaves are tightly packed together in a rosette, collecting water and trapping insects. Unlike Brocchinia reducta, which has been proven to produce at least one digestive enzyme and can therefore be considered carnivorous, the epiphytic Catopsis berteroniana has little evidence supporting the claims that it is carnivorous. It is able to attract and kill prey and the trichomes {{on the surface of}} the leaves can absorb nutrients, but so far no enzyme activity has been detected. It may be that this plant also relies on an internal food web for soft tissue digestion. The same could be said for Paepalanthus bromelioides, though it is a member of Eriocaulaceae and not a bromeliad. It also forms a central <b>water</b> <b>reservoir</b> that has adaptations to attract insects. It, like C. berteroniana, produces no digestive enzymes.|$|E
5|$|Archeological {{evidence}} for {{agriculture in the}} Sangam age has been retrieved from sites such as Mangudi, Kodumanal and Perur, which have yielded charred remains of seeds of crops like rice, millets including pearl millets, pulses and cotton. It has been deduced that agriculture most likely involved dry farming, with additional irrigation for cotton and rice; mixed cropping {{seems to have been}} undertaken to replenish the nitrogen in the soil—this also suggests a spread of labour and knowledge of different sowing and harvesting techniques. The presence of cotton seeds indicates the production of a crop aimed at craft production, which is also attested by finds of cotton and spindle whorls at Kodumanal. Remains of structures that resemble an artificial <b>water</b> <b>reservoir</b> have been located at different sites. In Arikamedu, a few terracotta ring-wells were found {{at the bottom of the}} reservoir; it has been suggested that the ring wells were to assure the supply of water during the dry season.|$|E
40|$|The abrupt {{changes in}} the streamflow and {{sediment}} load at nine hydrological stations of the Pearl River basin were systematically analysed by using the simple two-phase linear regression scheme and the coherency analysis technique. Possible underlying causes were also discussed. Our study results indicated that abrupt {{changes in the}} streamflow occurred mainly in the early 1990 s. The change points were followed by significant decreasing streamflow. Multiscale abrupt behaviour of the sediment load classified the hydrological stations into two groups: (1) Xiaolongtan, Nanning and Liuzhou; and (2) Qianjiang, Dahuangjiangkou, Wuzhou, Gaoyao, Shijiao and Boluo. The grouped categories implied obvious influences of <b>water</b> <b>reservoirs</b> on the hydrological processes of the Pearl River. On the basis of analysis of the locations and the construction time of the <b>water</b> <b>reservoirs,</b> and also {{the time when the}} change points occurred, we figured out different ways the <b>water</b> <b>reservoirs</b> impacted the hydrological processes within the Pearl River basin. As for the hydrological variation along the mainstream of the Pearl River, the <b>water</b> <b>reservoirs</b> have considerable influences on both the streamflow and sediment load variations; however, more influences seemed to be exerted on the sediment load transport. In the North River, the hydrological processes seemed to be influenced mainly by climate changes. In the East River, the hydrological variations tended to be impacted by the <b>water</b> <b>reservoirs.</b> The study results also indicated no fixed modes when we address the influences of <b>water</b> <b>reservoirs</b> on hydrological processes. Drainage area and regulation behaviour of the <b>water</b> <b>reservoirs</b> should be taken into account. The results of this study will be of considerable importance for the effective water resources management of the Pearl River basin under th...|$|R

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 18th century, horse-drawn coaches {{became much}} more common in Canterbury, which lay at the centre of a new turnpike road system. This {{required}} extensive changes to the city streets and gateways, which were typically too narrow to be easily navigated by these vehicles. By 1779, Northgate and Burgate had been destroyed to allow wider entrances for the city. Riding Gate was demolished in 1782, but in 1791 the local citizen James Simmons built a new, brick archway on the old foundations, which was rapidly occupied by a new house, blocking most of the gateway. An iron bridge was later built over the site of Riding Gate. The Worth Gate was demolished in 1791 and reused in a local garden, a new entrance being built in its place. Newingate's drum towers were used as a <b>water</b> <b>reservoir</b> for the city, and the gatehouse was not demolished until 1801. Sections of the wall were cut away to allow new roads to be built; the walls near St Radiguns's Public Baths were demolished in 1794 and the city wall around London Gate was demolished around 1800.|$|E
5|$|Just before Stamford, the Great North Road, now {{labelled}} the A1, {{crosses the}} river, and a pumping {{station on the}} north bank at Stamford Meadows has pumped large quantities of water to the Rutland <b>Water</b> <b>reservoir</b> since its construction in 1975. Stamford was the lowest {{point at which the}} river could be forded so the Roman Ermine Street crossed the Welland there. The A16 road crosses the river by a three-arched stone bridge designed by Edward Browning in 1845. Below it, Albert Bridge is made of iron with stone piers, and was erected by Stamford Town Council in July 1881, to replace an earlier bridge which was washed away in a flood. Beyond Stamford, the river passes the site and ruins of the Benedictine St Leonard's Priory. Hudd's Mill marks {{the point at which the}} Stamford Canal left the river. The present mill building dates from 1751 and 1771. The River Gwash, which the canal crossed on the level, joins from the north, and the remains of the canal follow the river on its north bank. Below Uffington, the county border follows the old course of the river, first to the south to Tallington and then to the north, while the main course now flows along the Maxey Cut to Peakirk. The old course consists of two streams, fed by sluices from the Maxey Cut, which meander to The Deepings. The eastern stream supplied power to Lolham and Maxey mills, while the western stream did the same for Tallington Mill, which dates from around 1700, West Deeping mill, and Molecey's mill, which still retains its seventeenth-century undershot waterwheel, modified in the 19th century to Poncelet's improved design, and the only surviving waterwheel of its type in Lincolnshire. At the western edge of Market Deeping the two streams join, and they are also joined by the Greatford Cut, which has carried the diverted waters of the West Glen river since the early 1950s.|$|E

40|$|Methane is a {{non-toxic}} colourless gas {{created by}} decomposition of organic materials in anaerobic environments. Such processes {{take place at}} bottoms of rivers, dams and <b>water</b> <b>reservoirs.</b> The gas is then released to atmosphere where it contributes to the greenhouse effect. The aim of this thesis is to measure the ebullition flux of methane from selected <b>water</b> <b>reservoirs</b> Vranov and Vír (representing typical <b>water</b> <b>reservoirs</b> in the temperate area), analyze factors affecting ebullition, and compare the ebullition flux among these two reservoirs. The data were obtained via device Simrad EK 60 split beam, preprocessed in software Sonar 5, and subsequently analyzed in statistical software R. While {{there is a great}} degree of variability of ebullition flux within segments of individual <b>water</b> <b>reservoirs,</b> the total ebullition flux is comparable in both <b>water</b> <b>reservoirs</b> (Vranov: 3, 90 ml·m- 2 ·d- 1, Vír: 4, 22 ml·m- 2 ·d- 1) and not significantly different from each other (p = 0, 40). When analyzing possible factors affecting ebullition; the water depth and the distance from the dam, it is necessary to take into account that these two variables are highly correlated which may hinder our ability to separate their effects. Indeed, in both Vranov and Vir the effects of these variables, while significant when studied [...] ...|$|R
