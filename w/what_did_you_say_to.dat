6000|$|... "But <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> him? {{you said}} something. You did not, at any rate, bid him {{remember}} {{that he was a}} poor labouring man, and that you were a lady of high rank." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Excuse me, I {{see what}} a person of colossal ignorance and {{simplicity}} can do. The idea of your going and intruding on a party of strangers, that way, and talking for half an hour; why I {{never heard of a}} man in his right mind doing such a thing before. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{believe she}} ever went out hunting {{in her life}} before she saw you. You mounted her,--and gave her a horse,--and took her out,--and brought her home. Everybody at Mistletoe knew all about it. My brother and the Duchess were told of it. It {{was one of those}} things that are plain to {{everybody}} as the nose on your face. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> her when you were coming home in that postchaise?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> him? tell me {{what you}} said to him. He was my own son, my only son. He was stubborn, and self-willed, but still he was my son; and his words were sweeter to me than music, and his face was {{brighter}} to me than the light of heaven. If you made him happy before he died, I will kneel down and worship you," [...] and joining her skinny hands together, she laid them upon Agatha's knees. [...] "Come, sweetest, {{tell me what}} answer you made my poor boy when he told you that he loved you." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{stay where}} you are," [...] she said imperiously, [...] "we'll throw them overboard--when we've <b>done</b> with them. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> Captain?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{stay where}} you are," [...] she said imperiously; [...] "we’ll throw them overboard—when we’ve <b>done</b> with them. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> captain?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Now if {{all this}} can be done in the key of tragedy and philosophic comedy, it can, I have always contended, be done in the key of farcical comedy; and Overruled is a trifling {{experiment}} in that manner. Conventional farcical comedies are always finally tedious because the heart of them, the inevitable conjugal infidelity, is always evaded. Even its consequences are evaded. Mr. Granville Barker has pointed out rightly that if the third acts of our farcical comedies dared to describe the consequences that would follow from the first and second in real life, they would end as squalid tragedies; and in my opinion they would be greatly improved thereby even as entertainments; for I have never seen a three-act farcical comedy without being bored and tired by the third act, and observing {{that the rest of the}} audience were in the same condition, though they were not vigilantly introspective enough to find that out, and were apt to blame one another, especially the husbands and wives, for their crossness. But it is happily by no means true that conjugal infidelities always produce tragic consequences, or that they need produce even the unhappiness which they often do produce. Besides, the more momentous the consequences, the more interesting become the impulses and imaginations and reasonings, if any, of the people who disregard them. If I had an opportunity of conversing with the ghost of an executed murderer, I have no doubt he would begin to tell me eagerly about his trial, with the names of the distinguished ladies and gentlemen who honored him with their presence on that occasion, and then about his execution. All of which would bore me exceedingly. I should say, [...] "My dear sir: such manufactured ceremonies do not interest me in the least. I know how a man is tried, and how he is hanged. I should have had you killed in a much less disgusting, hypocritical, and unfriendly manner if the matter had been in my hands. What I want to know about is the murder. How did you feel when you committed it? Why did you do it? <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> yourself about it? If, like most murderers, you had not been hanged, would you have committed other murders? Did you really dislike the victim, or did you want his money, or did you murder a person whom you did not dislike, and from whose death you had nothing to gain, merely for the sake of murdering? If so, can you describe the charm to me? Does it come upon you periodically; or is it chronic? Has curiosity anything to do with it?" [...] I would ply him with all manner of questions to find out what murder is really like; and I should not be satisfied until I had realized that I, too, might commit a murder, or else that there is some specific quality present in a murderer and lacking in me. And, if so, what that quality is.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well argued, Beth," [...] said Uncle John, approvingly. [...] "I couldn't {{have put}} the case better myself. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> Silas Watson?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What! Don't {{smoke or}} drink! That's queer. Wish I {{could say the}} same. Mighty {{expensive}} habits. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> your name was?" ...|$|R
