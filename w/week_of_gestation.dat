40|$|Background: Fetal brain {{development}} is a complicated process that continues throughout pregnancy. Fetal sulcus development has typical morphological features. Assessment of fetal sulcus development to understand the cortical maturation and development by prenatal ultrasound has become widespread. This study aimed to explore a reliable method to assess cortical sulcus and to describe the normal sonographic features of cortical sulcus development in the human fetus between 18 and 41 <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> <b>gestation.</b> Methods: A cross-sectional {{study was designed to}} examine the fetal cortical sulcus development at 18 – 41 <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> <b>gestation.</b> Ultrasound was used to examine the insula, sylvian fissure (SF), parieto-occipital fissure (POF), and calcarine fissure (CF). Bland-Altman plots were used for assessing the concordance, and the intraclass correlation coefficient was used for assessing the reliability. Results: SF images were successfully obtained in 100 % of participants at 22 <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> <b>gestation,</b> while the POF images and CF images could be obtained in 100 % at 23 <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> <b>gestation</b> and 24 <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> <b>gestation,</b> respectively. The SF width, temporal lobe depth, POF depth, and the CF depth increased with the developed <b>gestation.</b> The width <b>of</b> uncovered insula and the POF angle decreased with the developed <b>gestation.</b> By 23 <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> <b>gestation,</b> the insula was beginning to be covered. Moreover, it completed at 35 <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> <b>gestation.</b> The intra- and inter-observer agreements showed consistent reproducibility. Conclusions: This study defined standard views of the fetal sulcus as well as the normal reference ranges of these sulcus measurements between 18 and 41 <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> <b>gestation.</b> Such ultrasonographic measurements could be used to identify fetuses at risk of fetal neurological structural disorders...|$|R
