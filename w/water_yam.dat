In their outrigger canoes they carried food staples from home including rice, plantains, taro, and <b>water</b> <b>yam.</b> Sugarcane, ginger, sweet potatoes, pigs and chickens were also probably brought to Madagascar by these first settlers, along with coconut and banana. The first concentrated population of human settlers emerged along the southeastern coast of the island, although the first landfall may have been made on the northern coast. [...] Upon arrival, early settlers practiced tavy (swidden, [...] "slash-and-burn" [...] agriculture) to clear the virgin coastal rainforests for the cultivation of crops. They also gathered honey, fruits, bird and crocodile eggs, mushrooms, edible seeds and roots, and brewed alcoholic beverages from honey and sugar cane juice.|$|E

50|$|Yam crop {{begins when}} whole seed tubers or tuber {{portions}} are planted into mounds or ridges, {{at the beginning}} of the rainy season. The crop yield depends on how and where the setts are planted, sizes of mounds, interplant spacing, provision of stakes for the resultant plants, yam species, and tuber sizes desired at harvest. Small-scale farmers in West and Central Africa often intercrop yams with cereals and vegetables. The seed yams are perishable and bulky to transport. Farmers who do not buy new seed yams, usually set aside up to 30% of their harvest for planting the next year. Yam crops face pressure from a range of insect pests and fungal and viral diseases, as well as nematode. Their growth and dormant phases correspond respectively to the wet season and the dry season. For maximum yield, the yams require a humid tropical environment, with an annual rainfall over 1500 mm distributed uniformly throughout the growing season. White, yellow, and <b>water</b> <b>yams</b> typically produce a single large tuber per year, generally weighing 5 to 10 kg.|$|R

The people of this community are known to speak the Urhobo language fluently. They are mainly pastoral and prefer to live within the reach of their immediate or extended family. The people are majorly sustenance farmers though some still do commercial farming. The historical antecedent of trading in this community was majorly by Barter. Agricultural products like food-crops e.g. <b>water</b> <b>yams</b> could be exchanged for Okra. Although with time, cowries, came to be adopted as the medium of exchange {{before the advent of}} the present legal tender of naira.Okpara market day was held every four days. It was called Edewor and nobody was expected to go to farm on that day. Most farmers harvested their crops during harvest period, on a day to the market with a view to taking them to the market place the following day. There was also hawking in the streets on ordinary days. Kokori traders patronized Okpara Market. While many Okpara people patronized Kokori Central Market.

50|$|Because it {{has become}} {{naturalized}} throughout tropical South America, Africa, Australia, the southeastern U.S., D. alata has many different common names from these regions. In English alone, aside from purple yam, other common names include greater yam, Guyana arrowroot, ten-months yam, <b>water</b> <b>yam,</b> white yam, winged yam, or simply yam. In other cultures and languages it is known variously as ratalu or violet yam in India, rasa valli kilangu (இராசவள்ளிக்கிழங்கு) in Tamil, dandila (දන්දිල) in Sinhala, thuppa genasu (ತುಪ್ಪ ಗೆಣಸು) in Kannada, thoona or soona kerungu (ತೂ/ಸೂಣ ಕೆರುಂಗು) in Tulu, kondfal (कोंदफळ) in Marathi, kachil (കാച്ചില്) in Malayalam, and khoai mỡ in Vietnam.

40|$|Scarcity of seed, pest and {{diseases}} are major constraints to yam production. Tissue culture techniques of meristem culture combined with heat therapy {{have been used}} to produce high-yielding virus-tested plantlets of root crops, which are later multiplied through micropropagation. However, the micropropagation rate is low in yam. We investigated in vitro, the rate of production of new nodes at some Plant growth regulator regimes applied at specific growth phases of yam. Three concentrations each of uniconazole-p (UP), gibberellic, jasmonic (JA) and naphthalene acetic (NAA) acids were applied at single node and primary nodal complex (PNC) formation phases in a split-plot design using two genotypes each of white and <b>water</b> <b>yams.</b> Number of nodes per plantlet was recorded after 16 weeks. The number of new nodes varied significantly with genotype by growth phase interaction and the main effect of PGRs. After 16 weeks, the control, 1. 7 µM UP and 0. 03 µM JA had highest means of 7, 9 and 8 nodes per plantlet compared to 2 - 3 nodes in the GA treatments. Thus, 4, 900, 8, 100 and 6, 400 plantlets can be obtained in I year from a 100 -node plant. In D. alata genotypes, addition of PGRs at PNC doubled the number of nodes per plantlet relative to addition at single node stage, while the effect of stage varied with genotype in D. rotundata. There is an important role for GA and its inhibitor-UP on the rate of yam micropropagation. Optimum multiplication rates can be achieved if the right PGR is applied at a standardized growth phase of a particular genotype. Earliness of genotypes seems to be a major factor that will determine the timing of application of PGRs. Peer Revie...|$|R

Corals of every shape and hue were there; some resembling sunflowers and mushrooms; others, cabbages from an inch to three feet in diameter: while a third bore a striking likeness to the rose. The hillsides were typical of tropical climate; large flocks of parrots, monkeys in great variety, wild-mango and orange groves—a superb scene of plants and flowers of every description, glowing in vivid tints of purple, red, blue, brown, and green—but not the so-much-needed supply of water and provisions.|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{study the}} effect of yam in Taiwan, which is a {{commonly}} used Chinese medicine, on hepato-nephrotoxicity in rats. METHODS: Crude <b>water</b> extract of <b>yam</b> (Dioscorea alata L), was used to treat rats with an acute toxicity induced by acetaminophen (APAP) challenge. RESULTS: The pharmacological and biochemical studies showed the extract of yam had {{the effect of}} kidney secureness and liver fortification (P < 0. 01).

The extract of yam also possessed a good protection against the inflammation of central vein and necrosis of liver tissue. CONCLUSION: The liver and kidneys are originated from the same source. Pathologically, deficiency of the life essence in the kidney may lead to the blood deficiency in the liver. The results showed that the yam could prevent the damages of the Ever and kidneys, thus preserving their functions.
