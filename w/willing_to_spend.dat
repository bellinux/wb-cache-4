5|$|Nestlé Purina Petcare is a St. Louis, Missouri-based {{subsidiary}} of Nestlé. It produces and markets pet food, treats and litter. Some of its pet food brands include Purina Pro Plan, Purina Dog Chow, Friskies, Beneful and Purina ONE. The company {{was formed in}} 2001 by combining Ralston Purina, which was acquired by Nestlé for $10.3 billion, with Nestlé's Friskies Petcare Company. As consumers became <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> more money on their pets, the company grew. As of 2012, it is the second-largest pet food company globally and {{the largest in the}} United States.|$|E
5|$|BK Chicken Fries are a {{fried chicken}} product {{sold by the}} {{international}} fast-food restaurant chain Burger King. At {{the time of their}} introduction in 2005, the company had intended Chicken Fries to be one of their larger, adult oriented products made with higher quality ingredients than their standard menu items. Additionally, the product further targeted the snacking and convenience food markets with a specific packaging design that was intended to be easier to handle and fit into automotive cup holders. The product was part of a series of product introductions designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated fare and present a larger, meatier product that appealed to 24- to 36-year-old adult males. Along with this series of larger, more complex group of menu products, the company intended to attract a larger, more affluent adult audience who would be <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> more on the better quality products. They were discontinued in the United States in 2012, but continued to be sold in some markets, such as Italy. In August 2014, they were reintroduced for a limited time offering (LTO) in North America, leading to their permanent re-addition to the menu in March 2015 in over 30 countries globally.|$|E

25|$|The TenderCrisp {{sandwich}} {{is part of}} {{a series}} of sandwiches designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated, adult oriented fare and present a larger, meatier product that appeals to adults in the 24–36 years age bracket. Along with the TenderGrill and Angus sandwiches, these products are intended to bring in a larger, more affluent adult audience who will be <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> more on the better quality products.|$|E
25|$|Included in the {{new line}} was the Sirloin Steak Sandwich, a single oblong patty made of chopped steak served on a sub-style, sesame seed roll.

25|$|As {{far back}} as the 1970s, {{international}} fast food restaurant chain Burger King has attempted to introduce a premium line of burgers. These sandwiches are part of a system which eventually became known as the barbell strategy; a plan designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated, adult-oriented fare along with products that are more value-oriented. This program is intended to bring in a larger, more affluent adult audience who will be <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> more on the better quality products on one side while maintaining a lower cost value menu dedicated to a more cost-conscious audience on the other. The hope is that the customers would be drawn in initially for the lower prices of the value-menu and upgrade to the more expensive products, upping overall sales.|$|E

25|$|The {{relationship}} between Britain and America {{was at a}} breaking point when Buddington salvaged Resolute. They were {{on the brink of}} their third war. President Franklin Pierce addressed Congress to say he had ceased to have diplomatic relations with Britain. He closed the British embassies and sent the ambassadors home. Tensions continued to mount. Suddenly one of the most vocal hawks, Senator James Murray Mason, from Virginia, proposed a bill in Congress for the government to buy Resolute, refurbish her, and sail her back to Britain as a present. The bill passed, authorizing more than $40,000 for the work, and President Pierce signed it into law. Resolute was sent to the Brooklyn Navy Yard, where she underwent a complete refit, and Commander Henry Hartstene USN, sailed her back to Britain, arriving at Spithead on December 12, 1856. After Resolute was towed to Cowes so that the Queen and Prince Albert could tour her, Captain Harstene presented the ship to Queen Victoria as a gesture of peace and good-will on December 17, 1856. Soon the talk of war ceased, and the gift of Resolute was seen as instrumental in the easing of these tensions. Henry Grinnell, a New York merchant and ship owner who had grown up in New Bedford, had supported the purchase of Resolute to be used as the gift, and both he and Lady Franklin had hoped the Navy would use the ship for a new search for Sir John Franklin's expedition. However, by 1856 the Royal Navy was no longer <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> money on what they now believed would be a fruitless search. It was impossible to believe that any of the Franklin men could still be alive eleven years after they entered the Arctic. Belcher's abandonment of four seaworthy ships was the last straw. Nor was the Navy willing to let Lady Franklin use Resolute for a privately funded search. Britain could not risk losing Resolute after the important role the ship had played in smoothing the turbulent waters between her and America. Resolute stayed in home waters until she was taken to the breaker's dock at Chatham Dockyard in 1879.|$|E
500|$|For {{the last}} few decades the Burnside Fountain has been in disrepair. A 1986 {{inventory}} of public memorials in Worcester, compiled by the municipal parks and recreation department, listed the fountains problems as [...] "chipped stone, water system, bronze surface corrosion, rust staining, litter," [...] and the Smithsonian Art Inventories Catalog surveyed the fountain in September 1994 and listed its condition as [...] "treatment urgent." [...] With the one-hundredth anniversary of the Burnside Fountain coming in 2012, there has been renewed interest in restoring the fountain. Restoration estimates run between USD $40,000 to $60,000, which is more than the city is <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend.</b> Probably because of this, there are no official plans to restore the fountain, as of June 2012.|$|E
500|$|The writing effort changed {{direction}} when director Sidney Franklin {{fell ill}} and {{was removed from}} the production. Zimbalist offered the project to William Wyler, who had been one of 30 assistant directors on the 1925 film, in early 1957. Wyler initially rejected it, considering the quality of the script to be [...] "very primitive, elementary" [...] and no better than hack work. Zimbalist showed Wyler some preliminary storyboards for the chariot race and informed him that MGM would be <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> up to $10 million, and as a result Wyler began to express an interest in the picture. MGM permitted Wyler to start casting, and in April 1957, mainstream media outlets reported that Wyler was giving screen tests to Italian leading men, such as Cesare Danova.|$|E

500|$|The Hot Rock {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. AllMusic reviewer Steve Huey said that The Hot Rock [...] "isn't quite as immediately satisfying as its two brilliant predecessors, {{but it does}} reward those <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> time absorbing its nervy introspection and moodiness". Huey also praised the band's use of dynamic tempo changes within the album's songs. Wendy Mitchell, writing for CMJ New Music Monthly, felt that the band [...] "has matured into the musical equivalent of a twentysomething; still {{holding on to the}} energy of its youth, but exploring new options". The A.V. Club writer Stephen Thompson opined that The Hot Rock [...] "lacks the blaze-of-glory freshness of its justly acclaimed predecessors, [...] but [...] works just fine on its own as a terrific, explosive, and fun rock record".|$|E
500|$|Prices of durians are {{relatively}} high {{as compared with}} other fruits. For example, in Singapore, the strong demand for high quality cultivars such as the D24(Sultan), and Musang King (Mao Shan Wang) has resulted in typical retail prices of between S$8 to S$15 (US$5 to US$10) per kilogram of whole fruit. With an average weight of about , a durian fruit would therefore cost about S$12 to S$22 (US$8 to US$15). The edible portion of the fruit, known as the aril and usually {{referred to as the}} [...] "flesh" [...] or [...] "pulp", only accounts for about 15–30% of the mass of the entire fruit. Many consumers in Singapore are nevertheless quite <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> up to around S$75 (US$50) on a single purchase of about half a dozen of the favoured fruit to be shared by family members.|$|E

Nash was fired {{at the end of}} the season, with Steve Patterson assuming the general manager role in addition to his duties as president. In addition, the team had a poor relationship with the management of the Rose Garden, frequently complaining of a [...] "broken economic model." [...] It was widely speculated by the end of the year that Paul Allen would sell the team, and the team was offered for sale that summer, with several groups expressing interest. However, Allen was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> money and urged Pritchard to make draft-day trades. He subsequently took the team off the market.|$|E
500|$|The {{introduction}} of the Specialty Sandwich [...] line {{was one of the}} first attempts by a major fast food chain to target a specific demographic, in this case adults aged between 18 and 34 years, members of which were presumably <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> more on a higher quality product. Included in the new line was the Original Chicken Sandwich, a ham and cheese sandwich, a roast beef sandwich, a new fish sandwich called the Long Fish Sandwich, and a new burger called the Sirloin Steak Sandwich. The ham and cheese sandwich replaced an earlier version ham and cheese sandwich called the Yumbo that was served hot and was the size of a hamburger. In 1981 the chain tested a veal parmigiana sandwich in limited areas of the United States and took it national in 1982. It was also sold in New England as part of limited time offering (LTO) in 1988.|$|E
500|$|On {{his return}} to the United States after the June 1939 IOC session in London, Brundage {{systematically}} set about becoming a major collector of Asian art. The unsettled conditions caused wealthy Chinese to sell family heirlooms, and prices were depressed, making it an opportune moment to collect. He bought many books on Asian art, stating in an interview that a [...] "major library is an indispensable tool". After the US entered World WarII, stock owned by Japanese dealers in the United States was impounded; Brundage was able to purchase the best items. Dealers found him <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> money, but knowledgeable and a hard bargainer. Brundage rarely was fooled by forgeries, and was undeterred by the few he did buy, noting that in Asian art, fake pieces were often a thousand years old. In his 1948 article on Brundage for Life, Butterfield noted that [...] "his collection is {{regarded as one of the}} largest and most important in private hands in this country".|$|E

500|$|Getty's {{response}} to these issues was interventionist. [...] During his first budget, he targeted spending at the province's struggling agricultural sector, including a $2 billion loan program meant to address high interest rates. [...] His government tried to stimulate the energy sector by making loan guarantees to Husky Oil ($380 million) and Syncrude ($200 million) for new and expanded capital projects. [...] The government also provided a $55 million guarantee—in addition to a $20 million loan—to Peter Pocklington's Gainers meat-packing plant; when Pocklington defaulted on the loan, the government seized, and eventually closed, the plant. [...] This incident and others contributed to a perception that Getty's administration was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> public money to support large businesses, {{but that it was}} indifferent to the struggles of labour (the Gainers loan had initially been made after the government brokered a labour settlement favourable to the plant's management). In 1986 the price of oil bottomed at $US10 a barrel. Getty responded by providing the oil industry with $250 million in incentives and royalty cuts. By the end of 1986 Alberta had granted another nine-month cut from 12% to 1% in royalties at the Suncor oilsands.|$|E

[...] Frank said in an objection in a case at the Court of the United States District Court Northern District of Ohio of the CCAF, [...] "while the Center focuses on bringing objections to unfair class action settlements, it makes no effort to engage in quid pro quo settlements to extort attorneys, and has never settled an objection. The Center analyses complaints from consumers aggrieved by class actions settlement notices to determine whether a settlement is objectionable under the law because it favors attorneys over class members." ...|$|E
