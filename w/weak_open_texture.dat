40|$|AbstractThe paper {{investigates the}} nonsymbolic {{algebraic}} semantics {{of the weak}} bisimulation congruences on finite pi processes. The weak bisimulation congruences are studied both in the absence and {{in the presence of}} the mismatch operator. Some interesting phenomena about the open congruences are revealed. Several new tau laws are discovered and their relationship is discussed. The contributions of the paper are mainly as follows: 1. It is proved that Milner's three tau laws fail to lift a complete system for the strong open congruence to a complete system for the <b>weak</b> <b>open</b> congruence in the absence of both the mismatch operator and the restriction operator. A fourth tau law is proposed to deal with the match operator under the prefix operation. It is shown that for this calculus a complete system for the strong open congruence extended with all the four tau laws is complete for the <b>weak</b> <b>open</b> congruence. 2. It is verified that the four tau laws are also enough for the <b>weak</b> <b>open</b> congruence of the pi calculus without the mismatch operator. A complete system using distinctions is given. 3. It is pointed out that the standard definition of the <b>weak</b> <b>open</b> congruence gives rise to a bad equivalence relation {{in the presence of the}} mismatch operator. Two alternatives are proposed. These are the late open congruence and the early open congruence. Their difference is similar to that between the weak late congruence and the weak early congruence.

40|$|We are {{researching the}} problem of <b>open</b> <b>texture</b> in legal {{reasoning}} and how it leads {{to the evolution of}} legal ontologies. Concepts in law are open-textured, they can’t be uniquely matched to common sense concepts which describe real-world events. The argumentation that occurs in many legal cases is about the meaning of legal concepts. These legal concepts evolve through this argumentation. Our aim is to build computational models of this legal reasoning. We argue for the importance of ontologies for meta-knowledge in modelling this argumentation. We also argue that this work has relevance for ontology matching. 1 Legal Reasoning and <b>Open</b> <b>Texture</b> Legal reasoning is {{not simply a matter of}} identifying the subsumptions between legal concepts and real-world concepts.

Although there is considerable research effort dedicated to improve TSVs testing, no much attention has been paid to weak defects, especially to <b>weak</b> <b>open</b> defects (resistive opens) causing small delays.

40|$|This chapter {{begins by}} showing how EC {{consumer}} law is undergoing the opposing trend of centralisation and decentralisation. Whereas the maximum harmonisation character of recent consumer protection directives {{points to a}} direction of ever more centralised and open–textured rule–making, decentralisation is at play as far as enforcement is concerned (section 2). Especially {{in a system of}} decentralised enforcement, the characteristic <b>open</b> <b>texture</b> of EC (consumer) law sets limits to some of its most basic functions (section 3). How to deal with these limits of the law? A constructive attitude towards law’s <b>open</b> <b>texture,</b> promoting the political virtue of ‘integrity of law’ in Europe, is the right way to face these limits of the law. If legal practitioners consider law as integrity, the gap between the law and the use of law may be bridged. In addition, bridging the institutional gap between the upper, supranational level and the lower, national level might stimulate such integration of the day–to–day management of centralised regulation and decentralised enforcement of EC law (section 4). status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{investigate}} how conceptual engineering applies to mathematical concepts in particular. I {{begin with a}} discussion of Waismann's notion of <b>open</b> <b>texture,</b> and compare it to Shapiro's modern usage of the term. Next I set out the position taken by Lakatos which sees mathematical concepts as dynamic and open to improvement and development, arguing that Waismann's <b>open</b> <b>texture</b> applies to mathematical concepts too. With the perspective of mathematics as open-textured, I make the case that this allows us to deploy the tools of conceptual engineering in mathematics. I will examine Cappelen's recent argument that there are no conceptual safe spaces and consider whether mathematics constitutes a counterexample. I argue that it does not, drawing on Haslanger's distinction between manifest and operative concepts, and applying this in a novel way to set-theoretic foundations. I then set out some of the questions that need to be engaged with to establish mathematics as involving a kind of conceptual engineering. I finish with a case study of how the tools of conceptual engineering will give us a way to progress in the debate between advocates of the Universe view and the Multiverse view in set theory...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we are seeking}} general {{definitions}} of vagueness. They {{have much to do}} with dialectical reasoning since we are interested in vagueness caused by differing opinions, or points of view, about the definition of concepts. After giving three definitions for vagueness we sketch ways of choosing meaning for vague concepts, using “direct democracy”. In this context we also define <b>open</b> <b>texture</b> and a related concept, porosity. I am currently working on my Ph. D. thesis at the University of Montreal under the direction of Paul Bratley, of the Département d’informatique et de recherche opérationnelle, and Daniel Poulin of the Centre de recherche en droit public. Our team’s main subject of research is legal interpretation with differing points of view to reproduce the adversarial dimension in legal reasoning (see [Bratley 94] and [Poulin 93]). This paper is an offspring of that work. 1) Vagueness and <b>Open</b> <b>texture</b> Although vagueness is a vague concept, this section contains a few “natural language ” definitions intended to shed some light on the subject.

40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>open</b> <b>weak</b> CAD is introduced. Every open CAD is an <b>open</b> <b>weak</b> CAD. On the contrary, an <b>open</b> <b>weak</b> CAD is not {{necessarily}} an open CAD. An algorithm for computing <b>open</b> <b>weak</b> CADs is proposed. The key idea is to compute the intersection of projection factor sets produced by different projection orders. The resulting <b>open</b> <b>weak</b> CAD often has smaller number of sample points than open CADs. The algorithm {{can be used for}} computing sample points for all open connected components of f 0 for a given polynomial f. It can also be used for many other applications, such as testing semi-definiteness of polynomials and copositive problems. In fact, we solved several difficult semi-definiteness problems efficiently by using the algorithm. Furthermore, applying the algorithm to copositive problems, we find an explicit expression of the polynomials producing <b>open</b> <b>weak</b> CADs under some conditions, which significantly improves the efficiency of solving copositive problems.
