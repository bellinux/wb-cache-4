5|$|The Final Fantasy Legend was {{conceived}} by Nobuyuki Hoshino and developed under director Akitoshi Kawazu {{two years after}} Final Fantasy was released. It was the first installment of the SaGa series in Japan and the first Game Boy game produced by Square. Square president Masafumi Miyamoto requested developers create a Game Boy game after he noticed the success of Tetris and the popularity of handheld system. Kawazu and partner Koichi Ishii decided that instead of creating a game similar to Tetris, they would produce <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> customers desired most: a role-playing game.|$|E
5|$|In St-Calais' time as bishop, {{a long-running}} dispute began between the monks {{of the cathedral}} chapter and {{successive}} bishops. This arose because St-Calais {{did not make a}} formal division of the diocesan revenues between the bishop's household and the monks of the chapter. Nor had he allowed free elections of the prior. He may have promised these things to the monks before his death, but nothing was in writing. Thus, when a non-monk was selected to replace St-Calais, the monks began a long struggle to secure <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> had been promised to them, including the forging of charters ascribed to St-Calais that supported their case. These forged charters date from {{the second half of the}} 12th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{developers}} {{tried to}} redefine Lara Croft's actions by questioning <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> the character was capable of. While previous games used hand-animated movement for the character, Underworld introduced motion capture-based animation to display more fluid, realistic movement and facial expressions. Stuntwoman and Olympic Gold medalist Heidi Moneymaker was the motion capture actress, and advised the designers on practical movements. Animators adjusted and blended the recorded animation to create seamless transitions between the separate moves and their simultaneous combinations. The blends and additional animations give the character more flexible movement. Actions were overlapped {{to allow for}} multitasking, such as aiming at two separate targets and shooting {{with one hand while}} the other holds an object collected from the environment. Other additions include more melee attacks, as well as contextual offensive and climbing manoeuvres. Crystal Dynamics sought to make the visual appearance of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions identical, although the systems use different techniques to achieve this. In response to Underworlds lackluster sales figures, Eidos reportedly considered altering the character's appearance to appeal more to female fans.|$|E
5000|$|Amongst other things, a 2012 {{survey by}} Mada al-Carmel, the Arab Center for Applied Social Research, asked Arab {{students}} <b>what</b> obstacles <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> faced in getting into university: 71% said the psychometric exam {{was the primary}} obstacle, while 40% cited [...] "Jewish racism".

5|$|The {{production}} of The Rescuers signaled {{the beginning of}} a changing of the guard process in the personnel at the Disney animation studio: as veterans such as Milt Kahl and Les Clark retired, they were gradually replaced by new talents such as Don Bluth, Ron Clements, John Musker, and Glen Keane. The new animators, culled from the animation program at CalArts and trained by Eric Larson, Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston, and Woolie Reitherman got their first chances to prove themselves as a group with the animated sequences in Disney's live-action/animated hybrid feature Pete's Dragon (1977), the animation for which was directed by Don Bluth. In September 1979, dissatisfied with <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> was a stagnation {{in the development of the}} art of animation at Disney, Bluth and several of the other new guard animators quit to start their own studio, Don Bluth Productions, which became Disney's chief competitor in the animation field during the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|With {{the powers}} of the King's Clerk abolished, the bailiffs of Norwich set about {{regulating}} the operation of the market for <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> was the greatest benefit to the city. To encourage fair competition among the market's traders, it was forbidden to sell foodstuffs before the Cathedral bell had tolled for Lady Mass (6.00am). The practice of forestalling (meeting merchants {{on their way to the}} market either to buy their goods for resale, or to prevent them from attending the market and thus make goods of the type they were selling scarce and hence more expensive) was forbidden. Trading anywhere other than in the market was strongly discouraged and the right to re-sell goods at a profit was restricted to Freemen of the city. The prices of bread and beer were fixed, and a set of standardised weights and measures was introduced, against which measures used by merchants would regularly be checked. Shortly after the transfer of the market to the city a market cross was erected near the centre of the main market (opposite the present day entrance to Davey Place), the design of which is not recorded.|$|E
5|$|On 20 November 1816, King Girvan Yuddha died of smallpox, aged nineteen. Girvan had two wives – {{the first}} wife {{committed}} sati with Girvan, {{while the second}} wife also died of smallpox after 14 days of Girvan's death. Thus, Girvan was succeeded by his only son, Rajendra Bikram Shah, an infant of two years old, after 18 days of his father's death on 8 December 1816. Therefore, Bhimsen Thapa, in collusion with the queen regent, Tripurasundari, remained in power despite the defeat of Nepal in the Anglo-Nepalese War of 1814–16. There was a sustained opposition against Bhimsen from factions centered around leading members of other aristocratic families, notably the Pandes, who denounced <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> was his cowardly submission to the British. Paradoxically, the peace time after the Anglo-Nepalese War saw the inflation and modernization of the Nepal army, which Bhimsen used to keep his opposition under control, {{while at the same}} time convincing the suspicious British that he had no intention of using it against them. Bhimsen appointed his own family members and his most trusted men to the highest positions at the court and in the army, while members of older aristocratic families were made administrators of far-flung provinces of the kingdom, away from the capital.|$|E
40|$|Only {{ten percent}} of 1000 {{consecutive}} patients attending the St. Michael's Hospital Breast Clinic were practicing breast self-examination regularly. Seventy percent had tried and quit because of confusion, frustration and terror over <b>what</b> <b>they</b> had <b>felt</b> in their breasts.

30|$|Four {{dimensions}} of subjective success were measured: fulfilling work, financial rewards, recognition, and authority. Respondents indicated how important each success criteria was {{to their personal}} definition of success and also indicated to <b>what</b> extent <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>they</b> had achieved success on that dimension. Hierarchical regression models predicting job satisfaction, commitment, and turnover were examined.

5|$|Joel is {{voiced by}} veteran voice actor Troy Baker, while Ellie is voiced by actress Ashley Johnson. Their {{performances}} were mostly recorded using motion capture technology; approximately 85% of the game's animations were recorded using motion capture, with remaining audio elements recorded {{later in a}} studio. Though the team quickly felt that Johnson fit the role of Ellie, they spent more time selecting the actor of Joel, as the chemistry between the two characters was imperative to the game. After Baker and Johnson played alongside each other, the team realised that the former perfectly fit the role of Joel, despite the actor's young age. Druckmann attributed Baker's voice and movement to the team's choice of casting him. Baker and Johnson contributed greatly {{to the development of}} the characters. For example, Baker convinced Druckmann that Joel would care for Tess due to his loneliness, and Johnson convinced Druckmann to re-write the character of Ellie in a stronger and more defensive manner. Some of the dialogue between the duo was improvised by the actors; Druckmann attributed this to the fact that the script included an unnecessary number of lines during gameplay sections, and he allowed the actors to choose <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> was necessary. The characters of Joel and Ellie were the basis of the game; the development between the characters was established first, and the game's other concepts followed. From the beginning of development, the team intended for The Last of Us to feature dual protagonists with strong individual story arcs. During the Winter segment of the game, players assume control of Ellie. The developers ensured that this change was kept secretive prior to the game's release, to surprise players; they did the same with Ellie's immunity, as well as with the game's prologue, where players assume control of Joel's daughter Sarah. The change of control from Joel to Ellie signifies a change in the role of the protector, echoing Druckmann's previous ideas as a student. The character interactions were inspired by the relationship between Nathan Drake and Tenzin in Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, in turn inspired by the video game Ico. The game's protagonists represent the two eras that are shown in the game; Joel represents the world before the outbreak, having spent most of his life during this period, while Ellie represents the world after the outbreak, as she was born in the post-apocalyptic world. While the former is emotionally damaged due to the loss that he has experienced, the latter maintains an optimistic view of life, having become familiar to the damaged world; spending time with each other saw these qualities overlapping, with Joel become more lively, and Ellie learning more survival skills.|$|E

25|$|Since the mid-1980s, the California Supreme Court {{has become}} more conservative, {{particularly}} with regard to the rights of criminal defendants. This is commonly seen as a reaction against the strict anti-death penalty stance of Chief Justice Rose Bird in the early 1980s, although the funding that eventually brought about her defeat was from corporate and business interests concerned with <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> was an anti-business stance by the Chief Justice. The state's electorate responded by removing her (and two of her perceived liberal allies) from the court in November 1986.|$|E

30|$|Concerning {{the data}} source formats, Jensen and Buckley (2011) {{pointed out that}} the close-ended survey {{questionnaires}} lacked validity and reliability because they were too simple to include the complexity of science festivals and diversity of visitors. Thus, an effort was made in this study to compensate for the shortcomings from the previous studies. After the festival, the participating students who ran the booths, the teachers and community science organization members, and the SE students in SSF were asked to submit written reflections, photos or drawings about <b>what</b> <b>they</b> learned and <b>felt</b> from SSF. The submissions were voluntary and had no restrictions or guidelines for format in the writing or drawings. We included photos and drawings because SE students could have difficulties in expressing <b>what</b> <b>they</b> learned and <b>felt</b> through writing.|$|R

25|$|Tanguy at {{the time}} was married to Jeannette Ducroq, but they were separated, and he and Sage {{immediately}} fell in love. Breton and most of the other Surrealists were much less welcoming. Sage, still well off, was generous with her money, and the group of impoverished artists badly needed such support, but they resented her wealth and <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> was a haughty attitude that fitted her former title of “Princess” all too well. Her alliance with Tanguy caused a rift between Tanguy and Breton, who had formerly been close friends. Shrugging off this rejection, Sage went on calling herself a Surrealist.|$|E
25|$|Local {{indigenous}} peoples including the Métis, Haaninin and Siksika {{were accustomed to}} the buffalo hunt, however some Metis had arrived from the Red River valley in the 1840s-60 precisely because the hunt was declining in that region, a sign {{of things to come}} further west. When Manitoba was established in 1870, many Metis were disappointed with <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> was a disenfranchisement of their laws and way of life in the new province and migrated into the Saskatchewan river basin, establishing a settlement there and electing Gabriel Dumont as the first president of the council of St Laurent in 1872, charged with governing the annual buffalo hunts and other local laws.|$|E
25|$|Individual deists {{varied in}} the {{critical}} and constructive elements they argued for. Some rejected miracles and prophecies, but still considered themselves Christians because they believed in <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> was the pure, original form of Christianitythat is, Christianity as it supposedly existed before it was corrupted by additions of such superstitions as miracles, prophecies, and {{the doctrine of the}} Trinity. Some deists rejected the claim of Jesus' divinity but continued to hold him in high regard as a moral teacher, a position known as Christian deism, exemplified by Thomas Jefferson's famous Jefferson Bible and Matthew Tindal's Christianity as Old as the Creation. Other, more radical deists rejected Christianity altogether and expressed hostility toward Christianity, which they regarded as pure superstition. In return, Christian writers often charged radical deists with atheism.|$|E

25|$|Many of the {{producers}} behind the Super Tuscan movement were originally Chianti producers who were rebelling against <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> were antiquated DOC regulations. Some of these producers wanted to make Chiantis that were 100% varietal Sangiovese. Others wanted the flexibility to experiment with blending French grape varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot or to {{not be required to}} blend in any white grape varieties. The late 20th century saw a flurry of creativity and innovation in the Chianti zones as producers experimented with new grape varieties and introduced modern wine-making techniques {{such as the use of}} new oak barrels. The prices and wine ratings of some Super Tuscans would regularly eclipse those of DOC sanctioned Chiantis. The success of the Super Tuscans encouraged government officials to reconsider the DOC regulations in order to bring some of these wines back into the fold labelled as Chianti.|$|E
25|$|A {{graduate}} of University College Dublin, Ó Dálaigh was a committed Fianna Fáil supporter {{who served on}} the party's National Executive in the 1930s, he became Ireland's youngest Attorney General in 1946 under Taoiseach Éamon de Valera, serving until 1948. Unsuccessful in Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann elections in 1948 and 1951, he was re-appointed as Attorney General in 1951 and in 1953 he was appointed as the youngest member of the Supreme Court by his mentor, de Valera. Less than a decade later, he became Chief Justice, when selected by then Taoiseach, Seán Lemass. He was a keen actor in his early years and became a close friend of actor Cyril Cusack. It is commonly stated that Ó Dálaigh and Cusack picketed the Dublin launch of Disney's Darby O'Gill and the Little People, for <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> was the film's stereotyping of Irish people.

25|$|The Buccaneers took {{an early}} lead on Mike Washington's 29-yard {{interception}} {{return for a}} touchdown, after which he left {{the game with a}} pulled stomach muscle. Ricky Bell chipped a shoulder bone on his only play of the game. A Gary Fencik interception set up a Matt Suhey touchdown run that evened the score at 7–7. The Buccaneers' special teams broke down for the second week in a row. Jeff Fisher's 88-yard punt return touchdown broke the record for the longest punt return by a Tampa Bay opponent, a record that had been set by J. T. Smith just the previous week. A long Theo Bell punt return was called back for a penalty. The Buccaneers scored again on the first drive of the second half, which ended in a Kevin House touchdown reception. However, the Bears were able to dominate possession of the football {{for the rest of the}} game, with Walter Payton moving into fourth-place all-time in NFL rushing yardage. Despite a game plan that Jimmie Giles described as the best he'd seen against the Bears, the Buccaneers found themselves prone to errors at critical moments. They outperformed the Bears in most major offensive categories, compiling 450 yards of offense. Several players blamed mental errors and the lack of a killer instinct for the failure to put away <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> to be an inferior team, while others noted that the large number of injuries left the team without enough personnel to do the things they wanted to.
