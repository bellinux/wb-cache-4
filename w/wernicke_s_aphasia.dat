TITLE: The Use of Melodic Intonation Therapy in the Clinical Setting MAJOR PROFESSOR: Kenneth O. Simpson 	Melodic Intonation Therapy (MIT) {{is a popular}} published program for Broca 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>aphasia.</b> This investigation focused on the clinical use of MIT. Five participants were selected {{to take part in}} a survey. Of these five, none had purchased the program and all had created a modified MIT program. Some of the participants used their modified MIT program with individuals who do not have Broca 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>aphasia.</b> Varying levels of effectiveness were indicated by the participants about their modified MIT program...|$|R
40|$|Aphasia {{describes}} {{a spectrum of}} speech impairments due to damage in the language centers of the brain. Insult to the inferior frontal gyrus of the dominant cerebral hemisphere results in Broca 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>aphasia</b> - the inability to produce fluent speech. The left cerebral hemisphere has historically been considered the dominant side, a characteristic long presumed {{to be related to}} a person 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 handedness 2 ̆ 2. However, recent studies utilizing fMRI have shown that right hemispheric dominance occurs more frequently than previously proposed and despite a person 2 ̆ 7 s handedness. Here we present a case of a right-handed patient with Broca 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>aphasia</b> caused by a right-sided brain tumor. This is significant not only because the occurrence of aphasia in right-handed-individuals with right hemispheric brain damage (so-called 2 ̆ 2 crossed aphasia 2 ̆ 2) is unusual but also because such findings support dissociation between hemispheric linguistic dominance and handedness. © 2017, EduRad.

40|$|Although phonemic paraphasias {{are common}} in aphasic disorders, {{including}} Broca 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>aphasia,</b> conduction aphasia and transcortical motor aphasia, selective phonemic speech production impairment, or phonemic disintegration, is unusual. A patient with a selective phonemic speech production disorder underwent clinical, neuropsychological and structural neuroradiological assessment {{over a period of}} 6 years. The disorder was characterised by phonemic paraphasias (phonemic disintegration) with preserved comprehension and naming. Imaging showed a focal lesion in the white matter of the left precentral gyrus and, to a lesser extent, the posterior part of the left middle frontal gyrus, with overlying cortical atrophy. Biopsy of the lesion, after several years of observation, showed a calcified haemangioma. Clinical-anatomical correlation in this case suggests the importance of primary motor cortex of the inferior precentral (pre-Rolandic) gyrus and subjacent white matter in phoneme production, with sparing of the posterior inferior frontal gyrus (Broca 2 ̆ 7 s area) ...|$|R
40|$|Two {{types of}} monosyllabic speech {{discrimination}} training and {{two types of}} meaningful disyllabic speech discrimination training were conducted in a man with chronic Wernicke 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>aphasia.</b> The effects of training on speech discrimination ability and auditory comprehension were investigated. The patient was a 48 -year-old, right-handed male who started training about 4 years after putaminal hemorrhage. The training comprised a daily home task {{for a total of}} about 4 months, and the training results were measured once a week by a speech, language hearing therapist. In the monosyllabic speech discrimination training, a significant increase was seen in speech discrimination ability both in training with and without using written characters. In the speech discrimination training with meaningful disyllabic words, a better effect of training was seen with a method using oral reading of Kanji characters compared with a method of listening to sounds and comparing them with written characters. In an investigation of the effect using a Test of Lexical Processing in Aphasia for auditory comprehension, no change was observed with monosyllabic speech discrimination training; however, {{a significant increase in the}} number of correct answers was observed with speech discrimination training using meaningful disyllabic words...|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose-This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to correlate functional recovery from aphasia after acute stroke with the temporal {{evolution of the}} anatomic, physiological, and functional changes as measured by MRI. Methods-Blood oxygenation level-dependent contrast and echo-planar MRI were used to map language comprehension in 6 normal adults and in 2 adult patients during recovery from acute stroke presenting with aphasia. Perfusion, diffusion, sodium, and conventional anatomic MRI were used to follow physiological and structural changes. Results-The normal activation pattern for language comprehension showed activation predominately in left-sided Wernicke 2 ̆ 7 s and Broca 2 ̆ 7 s areas, with laterality ratios of 0. 8 and 0. 3, respectively. Recovery of the patient confirmed as having a completed stroke affecting Broca 2 ̆ 7 s area occurred rapidly with a shift of activation to the homologous region in the right hemisphere within 3 days, with continued rightward lateralization over 6 months. Ln the second patient, in whom mapping was performed fortuitously before stroke, recovery of a Wernicke 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>aphasia</b> showed a similar increasing rightward shift in activation recruitment over 9 months after the event. Conclusions-Recovery of aphasia in adults can occur rapidly and is concomitant with an activation pattern that changes from left to a homologous right hemispheric pattern. Such recovery occurs even when the stroke evolves to completion. Such plasticity must be considered when evaluating stroke interventions based on behavioral and neurological measurements...|$|R
40|$|Aphasia is an {{acquired}} language disorder experienced by approximately one million Americans today, many recovering from stroke or traumatic brain injury. Traditional therapy has focused solely on regaining specific linguistic skills, including auditory comprehension, speech, reading, and/or writing. Conversation partner training is a newer trend in aphasia intervention {{that has emerged}} thanks to an increasingly social model of disability and the pressure to deliver meaningful and cost effective health services. It fits nicely with the Life Participation Approach to Aphasia, which encourages clinicians to help individuals with aphasia and their families set and meet their own goals for therapy, which frequently focus on an overall improvement in quality of life rather than specific language skills. The Two to Tango program developed by Toronto 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Aphasia</b> Institute provides education to a conversational dyad-in this case a person with aphasia {{and his or her}} spouse-on Supported Conversation for Adults with Aphasia (SCA). This education is meant to make communication within a dyad more effective and to allow the person with aphasia to participate more fully in everyday activities. This thesis evaluates the practical impact of the program on two couples 2 ̆ 7 lives. After being trained in various supportive techniques, each spouse was able to more comfortably elicit a greater amount of information from her partner with aphasia. The results from this study provide evidence that supports conversation-based intervention for people with aphasia and their families...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Aphasia is a {{communication}} disorder associated with impairments in spoken language, understanding, {{reading and writing}} that impacts upon daily activities, participation in society {{and the quality of}} life of those with the condition and their family members. Despite existing literature demonstrating the pervasive and significant effects of aphasia on family members, rehabilitation programming, policy and funding are not well developed. The aim of this qualitative study was to describe the impact of aphasia on family members in the context of changes to their functioning and disability using the framework of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). Application of ICF concept of disability or "third-party disability 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 to family members of people with a health condition is discussed. Method: Twenty family members participated in individual in-depth semi-structured interviews. Interviews were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Research codes generated were subsequently mapped to the ICF. Results: The results of this study showed that family members experienced positive, neutral and/or negative changes to their body functions and activities and participation due to their significant other 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>aphasia.</b> Moreover, some family members attributed the development of a health condition or exacerbation of an existing health condition to the aphasia. Conclusion: Interpreted within the framework of the ICF, the results of this qualitative study reveal that family members of people with aphasia experience changes to their functioning and disability, known as "third-party functioning and disability 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7, as a consequence of the health condition of a significant other...|$|R

40|$|The {{most notable}} feature of Broca 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>aphasia</b> is 2 ̆ 2 agrammatic 2 ̆ 2 speech production, with loss of fluency and {{constriction}} of vocabulary. In addition, some Broca 2 ̆ 7 s aphasics {{have been found}} to exhibit difficulties in sentence comprehension, though the source of their comprehension problems remains controversial. One theory of agrammatism identifies impairment of the syntactic component, predicting errors both in comprehension and production. If there is a central syntactic deficit, then Broca 2 ̆ 7 s aphasics patients would be expected to perform poorly on sentences in which the correct interpretation hinges on a full syntactic analysis, independent of variations in other task demands. They would also be expected to yield a different pattern of errors than Wernicke 2 ̆ 7 s aphasics on sentences with complex syntactic structure. ^ To investigate these predictions the present study tested Serbo-Croatian speaking aphasics (seven Broca-type aphasics with agrammatic output; five Wernicke-type aphasics). The test sentences were semantically reversible relative clauses, which were administered in three different experimental tasks; grammaticality judgments, sentence-picture matching, and judgments of semantic anomaly. Because it minimizes nonsyntactic processing demands, the grammaticality judgment task was expected to provide the most accurate measure of syntactic competence. The sentence-picture matching task was used to provide a basis for cross-task comparison and for comparison with results of previous studies. Judgments on the semantic anomaly task also served for cross-task comparison and as a control for subjects 2 ̆ 7 semantic comprehension of the sentences. ^ The results showed that non-fluent aphasics can process complex syntactic structures, as evidenced by their performance with relative clauses on the grammaticality judgment task. Their rate of successful performance was considerably lower on the other tasks, however. The pattern of errors by Broca-type aphasics closely resembled the pattern displayed by Wernicke-type aphasics and normal subjects. These findings are interpreted as support for the view that comprehension deficits in agrammatism reflect varying degrees of loss of processing ability, but sparing of syntactic knowledge. Although use of grammatical knowledge is impaired in some tasks, it can be exploited successfully in tasks that minimize processing load. ...|$|R
40|$|Language {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} things in human 2 ̆ 7 s life to express their thoughts and feelings. However, some problems dealing with language ability can happen because of language disorders, one of them is Aphasia. This study is aimed at describing (1) The symptoms of Aphasia that are found in Megumi 2 ̆ 7 s character, (2) The communication gap between the interlocutor and Megumi as a patient who suffers from Aphasia, and (3) The communication strategies that are used by the interlocutor to communicate with Megumi as a patient who suffers from Aphasia. This research applied qualitative approach and document analysis in analyzing Aphasia phenomena in the subtitle and scenes of third episode of “Mr. Brain” dorama. The writer used a theory proposed by National Institute on Deafness and Communication Disorder (NIDCD, 2008) and a theory of communication gap proposed by Karten (2002) in analyzing dialogues of Megumi and the interlocutors in the movie script. The findings reveal that there are three Aphasia symptoms which refer to Wernicke 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Aphasia</b> shown by Megumi as the Aphasia patient in the third episode of “Mr. Brain” dorama. They are having difficulties in understanding words, having the ability of speaking, and having no weakness in tactile sensor and body. She is also unable to reconnect memory bank which has an important role in gaining back her vocabularies. The writer also finds mismatched communication preferences and mistaken assumption of understanding as the factors that cause communication gap. Moreover, the therapist can avoid some gaps in order to find the appropriate treatment to heal Megumi. Furthermore, the writer figures out three communication strategies that are used in Megumi 2 ̆ 7 s treatment. They are maintaining a natural conversational manner appropriate for an adult; repeating the content words and using prolongation in each word; and encouraging any type of communication, whether it is speech, gesture, pointing, or drawing. In Megumi 2 ̆ 7 s case, a Japanese word game (Shiritori) becomes the best treatment to improve her vocabularies. Through this study, the writer suggests for the future researchers who are interested in exploring Aphasia to investigate other Aphasia phenomena. The future researchers can also do further investigation in the relation of communication strategies with the progression of the Aphasia patient in gaining back his or her language ability...|$|R
40|$|Background: The loss of {{language}} and the inability to communicate effectively {{as a result of}} aphasia often affects community participation. Within the World Health Organisation International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, disability is recognised as a dynamic interaction between the individual 2 ̆ 7 s health condition, such as aphasia, and his or her personal and environmental factors. There has been little research identifying the environmental facilitators and barriers to participation for people with aphasia in the community, and no research focusing on the perspective of service industry workers. Aims: This study aimed to identify barriers and facilitators to community participation for adults with aphasia from the perspective of service industry workers. Methods & Procedures: Eight focus groups were conducted with 24 service industry employees. Transcripts of the focus group discussions were analysed using qualitative content analysis procedures, and barriers to and facilitators for participation of people with aphasia were identified. Outcomes & Results: Results revealed that the participation of people with aphasia in the community can be affected by many environmental factors within three broad categories: (1) people environmental factors, (2) physical environmental factors, and (3) business or organisational environmental factors. Conclusions: Service industry employees were able to identify a range of factors that would act as barriers and facilitators for people with aphasia. Some of the more significant findings include the lack of other people 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> awareness about <b>aphasia,</b> the willingness of service industry workers at the individual level to accommodate people with aphasia, and the difficulty in making the necessary system, policy, and procedural changes at the organisational level. Speech pathologists are encouraged to assist service industry providers to be more aphasia-friendly through education and training, in addition to assisting people with aphasia to become self-advocates...|$|R
40|$|Broca's Area (ie, Brodmann Areas (BA) 44 and 45) {{has been}} {{associated}} with syntactic comprehension since the 1970 <b>s.</b> In particular, <b>aphasia</b> and neuroimaging studies have shown that Broca's area distinguishes between sentences with subject extraction (ie, The horse that ▪ is kicking the bear is brown) compared to object extraction (ie, The horse that the bear is kicking ▪ is brown). The extracted argument is referred to as a filler and the position from which it is extracted is referred to as a gap and the relationship between them as a filler-gap dependency. Based on these results, functional accounts of Broca's area in sentence comprehension have been formulated that range from verbal Working Memory (WM) to General-Syntactic to Specific-Syntactic. Predictions of these three types of accounts were tested across 4 fMRI studies. Study I contrasted long-distance argument extraction to another syntactic dependency [...] -Reflexive Binding [...] -to see if there was activation overlap in Broca's area for the two dependencies in accordance with a general WM (verbal or syntactic) account. Study II presented a methodological improvement on Study I by parametrically varying the distance of the dependent elements in both dependencies. The results from Study I and II indicate that Broca's area is sensitive to WM demands in sentences with extraction but not those with Reflexive Binding. Study III investigated fMRI adaptation to the two syntactic complexity factors [...] -extraction type (object vs subject) and relative clause position (center-embedded vs right-branching). While anterior Broca's area (BA 45) adapted to extraction type only, posterior Broca's area (BA 44) adapted to both complexity factors. Finally, Study IV used parasitic gap constructions with their pronoun-containing alternative to investigate whether Broca's area is sensitive to gap-filling in addition to filler-to-gap distance. There was no evidence that Broca's area is sensitive to gap-filling in addition to filler-to-gap distance. Collectively, the results indicate that anterior aspects of Broca's area are specific to filler-gap dependencies and particularly to the filler-to-gap distance (ie, storage processes for the filler), whereas posterior aspects of Broca's area are more generally engaged in syntactic processing...|$|R

Study Program of English, Department of Languages and Literature, Faculty of Cultural Studies, Universitas Brawijaya. Supervisor: Fatimah; Co-supervisor: Yana Shanti Manipuspika Keywords: Broca Aphasia, Broca Aphasic, Language Production Disorder Human beings use {{language}} in completing complex systems of communication. Language production {{occurs in the}} human brain. One of language disorders caused by the damage of the brain is called aphasia. There are three broad categories of aphasia: fluent or Wernicke aphasia, non-fluent or Broca aphasia, and pure aphasia or Alexia. In this study, the writer only investigated the language production disorder of someone suffer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> from Broca <b>aphasia.</b> This disorder will trouble someone in producing the language. The {{aim of this study}} was to find out the characteristics of language production of Mr. Arifin as a Broca aphasic. This study used qualitative approach because it analyzed the language production disorder from a Broca aphasic. Case study was applied in this study to get the detail description from the subject. To investigate the language production disorder from the Broca aphasic, the writer did interview and analyzed the characteristics by using theory from Garman (1990). The data of this study were utterances produced by Mr. Arifin. This study revealed that there are seven characteristics of language production of Broca aphasic encountered by Mr. Arifin. Those are the output rate is low, the utterances have articulation disorder, are typically short, have fluency disorder, have disruption of normal intonational patterns, often omits the formation of affixes and function words, and mostly concern in content words. The writer found that the subject found difficulties in producing clear articulation, getting fluency disorder, and producing short utterances as the major characteristics encountered by Mr. Arifin. In this study, the writer concluded that Mr. Arifin cannot produce language as fluent as other people since he encounters seven characteristics of Broca aphasia. Producing language will give him hard situation and trigger language production disorder during speech. However, the result of this study cannot be generalized to other Broca aphasia cases. The last, the writer suggests the readers to be aware of the characteristics of Broca aphasia by knowing the characteristics of a Broca aphasic. Next, the writer suggests to the next researcher who wants to analyze the same field to compare the characteristics of language production disorder of a Broca aphasic with other aphasia. It is to enhance and enrich the study about language disorder, especially aphasia that is still limited in number in Indonesia...|$|R
40|$|Este estudo discute o agramatismo, termo utilizado para caracterizar um tipo de sintoma afásico, que desperta o interesse de médicos, fonoaudiólogos e lingüistas. Meu interesse pelo agramatismo foi motivado, antes de tudo, por efeitos de dizeres de afásicos, sobre mim, num atendimento clínico, quando apenas iniciava meu percurso como fonoaudióloga. Considerei necessário refletir sobre falas agramáticas. Iniciei minhas leituras e pude constar que as definições não contemplam a heterogeneidade das manifestações lingüísticas propriamente ditas e nem as análises divergem substancialmente, mesmo que, do ponto de vista do posicionamento teórico, as elaborações discursivas sejam plurais. Assim, um de meus objetivos, neste trabalho, foi apresentar um {{panorama}} das abordagens mais representativas, em que o agramatismo tem destaque e é questão problemática. Decidi, para isso, contrapor dois traçados históricos: um oferecido por Grodzinsky (1990), claramente ligado à reflexão de Chomsky sobre a linguagem, e outro realizado por Fonseca (2002), explicitamente decorrente do pensamento de Jakobson sobre as afasias. Procurei contrapor agramatismo e agramaticalidade porque, esta oposição não chega a ser focalizada e, como indico, discuti-la é de importância capital. Pareceu-me, também ou por conseqüência, que esses termos acabam confundidos, a meu ver, equivocadamente. Afirmo ser esta uma questão que mantenho para reflexão futura. Este trabalho filia-se à vertente teórica do Grupo de Pesquisa, cadastrado no CNPq: Aquisição, Patologias e Clínica de Linguagem do LAEL-DERDIC da PUCSP, liderado por Maria Francisca Lier-DeVitto, em que questões teórico-clínicas relativas às afasias vêm sendo abordadas em profundidadeThis study {{focuses on}} and discusses {{the concept of}} agrammatism which names and qualifies {{a particular kind of}} aphasic symptom related to a specific damaged cerebral zone or area. Physicians, speech pathologists/therapists and linguists have tried to describe such a linguistic occurrence also endeavored to develop theoretical proposals in order to provide plausible explanations for the mentioned phenomenon. My interest in discussing the so called agrammatism started {{at the very beginning of}} my clinical practice as a speech therapist, i. e., when I received one of my first aphasic patients. The effects of that patient s utterances on me were quite paradoxical in the sense that, although evaluated as severely ungrammatical, they sounded communicative to me, that is, I felt at ease to interpret them. Face-to-face with such a disturbing situation, I decided to study and reflect upon the effects of agrammatical utterances on the listener and also on agrammatism itself. I found out that none of the representative theoretical or descriptive approaches investigated could either help me understand the above mentioned subjective effects, or touch the heterogeneity of the agrammatical utterances. Moreover, I could verify that although not coincident on discursive grounds, most of the investigated theoretical proposals converged as to the methodological-descriptive approach they applied. Two different historical constructs concerning Aphasia are presented in the first part of this thesis: one which was derived from Chomsky s reflections on language and another one which was developed from Jakobson <b>s</b> studies on <b>aphasia.</b> Two researcher <b>s</b> discussions were respectively at stake: Grodzinsky s (1990) and Fonseca s (1995, 2002), respectively. On the second part I aimed at opposing the notions of agrammatism and ungrammaticality which seemed to be a possible source of theoretical-methodological problems. It must be stressed that such a discussion, although recognized by me as extremely important and original on intuitive grounds, has just been initiated. The LAEL-CNPq certified Research Group: Language Acquisition, Language Pathology and Language Clinic, supervised by Dr. Maria Francisca Lier-DeVitto, provides this study with specific theoretical backgroun...|$|R
