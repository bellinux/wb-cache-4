40|$|A {{ground-breaking}} {{discourse on}} an increasingly vital topic that {{moves away from}} the traditional concept of security [...] as demarcated in the framework of deterrence, power balancing and military strategy. Post-crisis Asia, with the crumbling of some regimes and a possibility of weakened traditional power structures, has to grapple with new ideas of <b>what</b> <b>other</b> <b>areas</b> might constitute a security threat. Thus, issues such as the environment, migration, pluralism, regionalism, and the media now take on greater significance. This volume examines all these and more. The future role of regional groupings, such as ASEAN and EAEG, is examined in the light of recent events in post-Suharto Indonesia and East Timor. Essential reading for all interested in security dimensions. This volume is based on a Ford Foundation-sponsored study convened by the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies in Singapore and covers the following areas: Globalisation and Security, Regional Institutions and Security, Governance in Plural Societies and Security, and Environmental Security...|$|E

40|$|The review {{highlights}} {{experience and}} administration {{perspectives of the}} immunobiological medication Omalizumab in allergy. Omalizumab is the anti'IgE monoclonal antibody. Growing successful experience of anti'IgE application confirms the assumption that treatment by Omalizumab may modify the course of bronchial asthma, by preventing the remodeling processes in the respiratory tracts and reducing hyperactivity of bronchi. Today, it is widely discussed <b>what</b> <b>other</b> possible <b>areas</b> of anti'IgE therapy there might be. Omalizumab might be very important in treatment of different potentially IgE'dependent diseases, among which there is urticaria and angioneurotic edema, allergic rhinitis, nasal polyposis and severe forms of allergic conjunctivitis. Besides, Omalizumab, {{as part of the}} allergen specific immunotherapy protocol, may also provide sizable advantages. The author reveals potential role of Omalizumab in treatment of other atopic diseases, such as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, atopic dermatitis and food allergy.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} causes of employee turnover in the food and beverage outlets of a four-star hotel in Dublin this hotel {{is referred to as}} Hotel X throughout the study. The hospitality industry has been characterised by high turnover levels that are often equated to unsocial hours and long hours worked, the Irish hospitality industry is no expectation to this. The high level of turnover has a negative effect not only at a monetary level but also at a morale level. This dissertation will identify what the former employees of Hotel X deem are the main reasons employees leave and what caused them to exit the organisation. A thorough review of past literature is included in this dissertation; this includes the opinions and findings of academics and past researchers on the topic of employee turnover. Coupled with this a mixed method approach is applied to gain a rounded and in-depth view of the case. The dissertation not only delves into the causative factors of employee turnover from the perspective of former employees but also suggests {{what can be done to}} reduce the turnover of this property or a similar property, the dissertation also goes on to suggest in <b>what</b> <b>other</b> <b>areas</b> a similar case study could be conducted...|$|E
40|$|There are no {{published}} {{books by}} Noam Chomsky which concern themselves with education or which are written with educationists {{in mind as}} the intended and specific audience. Of his many published articles, only one short paper deals specifically {{with some of his}} views on education, and, even here, mainly in the general philosophical terms of the humanistic conception of education. Yet Chomsky's influence on courses of teacher training and on the teaching of language, by any standard, is immense. At the same time it would be reasonable to assume that the classroom teacher has only a vague impression of Chomsky's significance for education. What are his attitudes towards those areas of education to which he has directly contributed? To <b>what</b> <b>other</b> <b>areas</b> has he turned his attention and how has he attempted to influence them indirectly through his writings?. To what extent do his published writings reveal his attitudes toward pedagogy? Is his philosophy of education clearly and cogently revealed in his works? What can be deduced about his attitudes to the "institution" (in a sociological sense) of education? Are his attitudes consistent and do they have a common source? This study explores each text and published paper of ChomsKy, from his most productive and diversified period, in order to extrapolate all references to education, as defined within certain narrow and exclusive limits. The period selected, the method of extrapolation and the definitive boundaries applied, are discussed more fully in the INTRODUCTION which follows. From each extrapolated reference, wherever it is more than incidental, and from its context, inferences are made which comment upon and try to reveal Chomsky's attitudes to education, as it is narrowly and exclusively defined in the INTRODUCTION. Part One of the study briefly describes Chomsky's place in that disciplinary area where he has made his most notable contributions; theoretical linguistics and linguistic philosophy. Each of Parts Two, -Three and Four deals with a chronological period, extrapolating references from all the published works which have relevance in the terms of this study. Part Five collates and categorises the many attitudes inferred and discussed in Parts Two to Four...|$|E

The {{interaction of the}} concrete structure with the surrounding soil often influence some capacity parameters related to the limiting loads, or stress for the structure in question. One of the basic assumption of Terzaghi’s in deriving the bearing capacity equation is “the base of the footing is rough”, to <b>what</b> degree? <b>Other</b> <b>areas</b> of importance are skin friction component of a concrete pile capacity, both driven and bored. For concrete driven pile, the effect of concrete–soil interface properties on estimation of skin frication capacity is reliably well predicted by relevant equations for example Nordlund [1], However, for bored in-situ concrete pile both qualitative and quantitative assumptions are made {{on the influence of}} interface friction. The most common one for a C-∅ soil is the tangent of two-third of internal angle of friction of the soil as the angle of wall friction value for the soil concrete interface.

50|$|The crater is {{understood}} by the 2010s to have two main rock types, the Shoemaker Formation and the Matijevic Formation. It has been classified as a complex crater and it {{is thought to be}} so old many of its features have been worn away. Some questions were raised about the tilt of the rim, however understanding is hampered by a lack of knowledge about Martian impact craters: Endeavour was the largest Martian impact crater up to that time to be studied that closely. An example of the difficulty of studying Mars features is also apparent with Orcus Patera, which has various volcanic, tectonic, or cratering events explanations for its formation. One famous Mars realization was that what was then called Nix Olympica was a volcano, and then renamed Olympus Mons thanks to Mariner 9 orbiter observations in the early 1970s. Endeavour crater was identified as having clay minerals, as detected from orbit by Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which according to theories at that time indicated rock from an older, wetter, time period on Mars. This type of rock is different from <b>what</b> prevails in <b>other</b> <b>areas</b> of surrounding plains.|$|R
40|$|From the {{comparative}} analysis of modern social sciences {{in the five}} countries analyzed, we clearly see that, much like <b>what</b> happened in <b>other</b> <b>areas</b> of the world, including Europe, Latin American social sciences, too, went through their process of institutional consolida-tion during {{the second part of}} the 20 th century. We also see, in the emphasis on the various themes and contents approached, a signifi-cant relationship between this process and the sociopolitical context, not only in each country, but also in the whole region and the world, even though the formats differ from country to country. Our comparative analysis shows that there are widespread simila-rities in processes of institutionalization occurring in different Latin American and European countries. This finding, which is in agree-ment with sociological and historical analyses of the emergence and development of social sciences in the West, does not prevent us from stating, at the same time, that such a relationship has not had uniform effects on social sciences activities in all countries at every period. On the contrary, different impacts can be seen, even totally opposing impacts, depending on the country and the period in ques-tion. Therefore, we should avoid the simplistic views that have often dominated the discussion on the politicization of social sciences i...|$|R

40|$|Emotional {{events are}} better remembered than neutral events. But {{what are the}} {{mechanisms}} behind this memory enhancing effect? It seems that they depend on the arousal level at the moment we experience the event to be remembered. The first study of the present thesis mapped the brain areas that changed their activity in a highly arousing situation in subjects with snake or spider phobia. Looking at pictures of their feared object engaged the amygdala, situated in the medial temporal lobe. This area has previously been demonstrated to be necessary for fear reactions. Here, the novel question was <b>what</b> <b>other</b> brain <b>areas</b> the amygdala engages when the brain {{is in a state}} of high arousal. Results suggest that the amygdala recruits other limbic and cortical areas known to be involved in motor behavior and object recognition. In contrast, when subjects watched fear-relevant but non-phobic pictures, amygdala activity was negatively correlated to the anterior cingulate cortex suggesting cortical inhibition. The final two studies aimed at explaining the physiological brain mechanisms behind arousal enhancement of memory. In the first one, epileptic patients with medial temporal lobe resections including the amygdala were compared to healthy controls on a recognition memory task where the pictures to be remembered varied in arousal intensities. Results suggested that the anterior medial temporal lobe including the amygdala is necessary for arousal enhancement of memory because the enhancement effect was abolished in resectioned patients. The last study related inter-individual differences in bodily arousal to amygdala-parahippocampal interaction. Results suggest that the beneficial effects of emotion on memory depend on arousal regulating mechanisms of the amygdala that in turn affects parahippocampal activity. Collectively, results suggest that the amygdala is regulating changes in arousal states of the brain and body during distressful situations. Further, arousal in turn determines memory strength through gating amygdala influences on the parahippocampal cortex. Thus, the amygdala is a node both in a fear and a memory network and arousal influences the amygdala to prepare for action and to enhance memory. This seems evolutionary sound. ...|$|R
