5|$|In 1997 {{the myth}} of Myrrha and Cinyras was one of 24 tales from Ovid's Metamorphoses that were retold by English poet Ted Hughes in his poetical work Tales from Ovid. The work was praised for not {{directly}} translating, but instead retelling the story in a language which was as fresh and new for the audience today as Ovid's texts <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> contemporary audience. Hughes was also complimented on his achievements in using humour or horror when describing Myrrha or a flood, respectively. The work received critical acclaim winning the Whitbread Book Of The Year Award 1997 and being adapted to the stage in 1999, starring Sirine Saba as Myrrha.|$|E
5|$|Within the {{recording}} industry, Martin {{was known for}} having become independent {{at a time when}} many producers were still salaried. However, EMI refused his pleas for royalties on his own work. By 1965, the Beatles' success had given Martin the leverage to start Associated Independent Recording (AIR), which enabled him to hire out his services to other artists. Martin also took EMI’s best producers and staff along with him to AIR. AIR demonstrated how important Martin's talents <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> artists, and it allowed him a share in record royalties on his hits. To this day, AIR remains one of the world's pre-eminent recording studios. In 1979, Martin opened a studio on the Caribbean island of Montserrat. This studio was destroyed by Hurricane Hugo ten years later.|$|E

25|$|Gambier-Parry {{designed}} the coped tomb of his father, which is positioned in the churchyard {{east of the}} chancel of the Church of the Holy Innocents. The monument to Thomas Gambier-Parry is Grade II listed. The architect also worked on the sanctuary and chancel arch of All Saints' Church on Oakleigh Road North in Friern Barnet, London. In 1889 he restored the Church of St Margaret in Bagendon, Gloucestershire, now Grade 1 listed. Improvements made to the Grade II* listed Church of St Mary in Bayford, Hertfordshire in 1890 <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> design. Gambier-Parry made design changes to the Grade II* listed Church of St James in Quedgeley, Gloucestershire about 1890. The glass in the chancel east window of Elmore Church in Elmore, Gloucestershire, was dedicated to Sir William Vernon Guise and designed by Gambier-Parry in 1890. He also made improvements to Elmore Court in Elmore, Gloucestershire in the late 19th century. In 1894 to 1895, he restored and enlarged the Grade II* listed St James' Church in Cranham, Gloucestershire. In 1895 he made design changes to St Michael Church in Boulge, Suffolk, {{on behalf of the}} Holmes White family. Gambier-Parry was also responsible for the late 19th century alabaster-work in the sanctuary of the Lady Chapel of St Mary the Virgin, Bathwick. He was the architect of Whitemoor, opposite Amberley Church, {{in the western part of}} the parish of Minchinhampton, Gloucestershire. In 1908 Gambier-Parry {{designed the}} Grade II listed Iveson Manor in Ampney St Peter, Gloucestershire. About 1908, the first vicar of the Grade II* listed St Mary the Virgin, Bourne Street in London selected him to replace the reredos of the high altar. The architect installed an arch fabricated of dark wood and, above the arch, ornamentation in a sunburst design. He also built the organ case and loft for St Mary's Bourne Street, using an English baroque style, with pediments, scrollwork, and finials. The Grade II listed Pytte House of Clyst St George, Devon, was renovated and enlarged by Gambier-Parry in 1911. In the 1930s, he restored St Michael's Church (pictured) at Duntisbourne Rouse in Gloucestershire, at the same time living in the nearby old rectory. The church was Grade I listed in 1958.|$|E

500|$|Harrison's doctors tried cures, {{applying}} opium, castor oil, leeches, and Virginia snakeroot. But {{the treatments}} only made Harrison worse, {{and he became}} delirious. He died nine days after becoming ill, at 12:30am on April 4, 1841, of right lower lobe pneumonia, jaundice, and overwhelming septicemia. He was the first United States president to die in office. His last words <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> doctor, but assumed to be directed at Vice President John Tyler, [...] "Sir, I wish you to understand the true principles of the government.

500|$|He died at Down House on 19 April 1882.

He had expected {{to be buried in}} St Mary's churchyard at Downe, but at the request of Darwin's colleagues, after public and parliamentary petitioning, William Spottiswoode (President of the Royal Society) arranged for Darwin to be honoured by burial in Westminster Abbey, close to John Herschel and Isaac Newton. The funeral was held on Wednesday 26 April and was attended by thousands of people, including family, friends, scientists, philosophers and dignitaries.|$|E
500|$|During shooting, Hitchcock {{was forced}} to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme {{close-up}} on Marion's eye and pulls up and out, proved very difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face {{made her want to}} blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera. Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough. Leigh had trouble saying [...] "Not inordinately" [...] for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes. Lastly, the scene in which the mother is discovered required a complicated coordinating of the chair turning around, Vera Miles (as Lila Crane) [...] hitting the light bulb, and a lens flare, which proved to be the sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> satisfaction.|$|E

[...] Bambi said that normally Larry did this stunt after the bigger stunts as [...] "his way of blowing off steam...winding down." [...] As Larry was performing the maneuver, something went wrong and the front end of his bike started to wobble. Rather than being able to jump down in the seat and regain control, Larry fell off the bike, hitting his head. [...] Larry sustained serious head injuries and he was airlifted to the Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte. [...] Indian Larry died from his injuries on Monday, August 30, 2004 at 3:30am.

2500|$|From {{the age of}} 16 until 32, Nichiren, {{originally}} a monk of [...] Tendai Buddhism, studied in numerous temples in Japan, especially Mt. Hiei (Enryaku-ji) and Mt. Kōya, in his day the major centers of Buddhist study, in the KyotoNara area. He eventually concluded that the highest teachings of Shakyamuni Buddha (563?–483?BC) were {{to be found in}} the Lotus Sutra. The mantra he expounded on 28 April 1253, known as the Daimoku or Odaimoku, Namu-Myōhō-Renge-Kyō, expresses his devotion to that body of teachings. During his lifetime, Nichiren stridently maintained that the contemporary teachings of Buddhism taught by other sects, (particularly the Nembutsu, Zen, Shingon, and Ritsu sects) <b>were,</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> mind, mistaken in their interpretations of the correct path to enlightenment, and therefore refuted them publicly and vociferously. In doing so, he provoked the ire of the country's rulers and of the priests of the sects he criticized; he was subjected to persecution which included an attempted beheading and at least two exiles.|$|E

2500|$|Regarding {{the ethics}} complaint, the state {{commission}} determined Bunn made 1,433 {{violations of the}} ethics laws and faced up to a $1,000 fine for each violation {{as well as a}} fine for as much as double the value of the improper benefits. The commission also removed 1,334 of the charges [...] made against Bunn. Bunn had reimbursed the state for many of the personal expenses and returned the state car and state cell phone after the improprieties were discovered by The Oregonian newspaper. Some of the long-distance phone calls at issue <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> ex-wife, who also worked for the Department of Education in the same building as Bunn. There was also a charge he used his office to get a free trip to Los Angeles for his daughter. He drew further scrutiny when he mailed his defense of the allegations to state legislators using state funds and letterhead, which led to another ethics complaint.|$|E
2500|$|Eddie {{reported}} {{that he intended to}} fly to the Pacific coast and back on July 30, 1930. On August 25, 1930 he set the round-trip transcontinental air speed record for pilots under the age of twenty-one years in his Cessna using a Warner Scarab engine. The trip was sponsored by Richfield Oil. He flew from Westfield, New Jersey on August 14, 1930 to Los Angeles, California in 4days with a combined flying time of 29 hours and 55 minutes. He lowered the East to West record by 4 hours and 22 minutes. He then made the return trip from Los Angeles to Roosevelt Airfield in New York in 27 hours and 19 minutes, lowering the West to East record by 1hour and 36 minutes. His total elapsed time for the round trip was 57 hours and 14 minutes, breaking the preceding record for the round trip. Frank Herbert Goldsborough held the previous record which was 62 hours and 58 minutes. When Eddie landed in New York on August 25, 1930, his first words <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> father: [...] "Hello Pop, I made it." [...] He was carrying letters from the Mayor John Clinton Porter of Los Angeles, to Mayor Frank Hague of Jersey City. Combined he set three records.|$|E
