40|$|Abstract—The {{lack of data}} {{authentication}} and integrity guarantees in the Domain Name System (DNS) facilitates {{a wide variety of}} malicious activity on the Internet today. DNSSec, a set of cryptographic extensions to DNS, has been proposed to address these threats. While DNSSec does provide certain security guarantees, here we argue that it does not provide what users really need, namely end-to-end authentication and integrity. Even worse, DNSSec makes DNS much less efficient and harder to administer, thus significantly compromising DNS’s availability— arguably its most important characteristic. In this paper <b>we</b> <b>explain</b> <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> of DNS, examine the threats against it, present the details of DNSSec, and analyze the benefits of DNSSec relative to its costs. This cost-benefit analysis clearly shows that DNSSec deployment is a futile effort, one that provides little longterm benefit yet has distinct, perhaps very significant costs. T I...|$|R

40|$|International audienceLet a {{computer}} program learn {{to play a game}} has been for long a subject of studies. It probably began in 1959 with A. Samuel's program [Sam 59], and similar methods are still used on the most advanced computer programs, such as Deep Thought; however, in chess, the different methods used are mainly linear regression on parameters of the evaluation function. Othello was, from the start, a game where learning proved to be very useful. The BILL program used Bayesian learning [LM 90] to improve parameters of the evaluation function. Similar methods are still applied for the best Othello programs (such as LOCISTELL 0 [Bur 94]). However, these methods require large databases of games, and are very efficient only on Othello game playing, because the game always terminates in a fixed number of moves, with perfect end-games up to 15 moves. Such methods {{would be very difficult to}} use on chess playing algorithms. Other techniques used include co-evolution [SG 94], use of neural networks trained by GA to focus minimax-search [MM 94], evolving strategies with GA [MM 93]. However, [SG 94] did not lead to world class Othello program, [MM 94] was unable to improve search as soon as the evaluation function was good enough to correctly predict the move, and [MM 93] was apparently not able to improve the classical (positional+mobility) strategy. In this article, we show how genetic algorithms can be used to evolve the parameters of the evaluation function of an Othello program. We must stress that our method can be used on any algorithm using an evaluation function, for any two players game.

40|$|Abstract. We study a Maxwell–Bloch system {{describing}} {{the dynamics of}} single-longitudinal Raman lasers in the two transverse space dimensions. Raman lasing is generated by a coherent external pump laser, as a three-wave interaction involving two optical and one material wave.

Raman lasers {{have the advantage of}} being tunable and display a novel explicit nonlinear detuning between the pump and laser emission frequencies. Consequently these lasers exhibit much richer nonlinear dynamics.
