5|$|For Pokiri, Mahesh {{sported a}} longer hair style {{than in his}} {{previous}} films and shed five kilograms of weight. He used a new wardrobe and the same pair of shoes throughout the film. Jagannadh wanted to cast Ayesha Takia as the female lead. Due to a last minute change, the makers opted to replace Takia and considered several actresses including Deepika Padukone. Jagannadh approached Parvati Melton to play the female lead. She declined the offer because, at that time, her parents were against her decision to become an actress. He also approached Kangana Ranaut who could not accept the role because of scheduling conflicts with the filming of her scenes in Gangster (2006). After seeing stills of Ileana D'Cruz in her Telugu debut Devadasu (2006), Jagannadh signed her as the female lead since he needed a girl <b>who</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a teenager {{to play the role}} of the aerobics teacher.|$|E
5|$|Chopra saw {{the deal}} as an {{opportunity}} to represent South Asians and break Indian stereotypes in Hollywood and the United States in general. In the process, she became the first South Asian to headline an American network drama series. She revealed that when she was in school , she never saw anyone on television <b>who</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> her, and she found it really weird because she thought there were so many people of South Asian descent in America and {{in other parts of the}} world. She also revealed that she did not want to be a stereotype of what Indians were usually seen as in global pop culture, saying that Indians never talk like Apu from The Simpsons. After signing the deal and being given all the 26 pilot scripts that ABC was developing for the 2015–2016 television season, Chopra chose Quantico. Having appeared in over fifty films at that time, the series was also Chopra's first ever audition, which she found very new and nerve-wracking at the same time.|$|E
25|$|Under these circumstances, Shivaji Maharaj {{decided that}} escape {{was the only}} option. He {{gathered}} {{a small number of}} soldiers along with his trusted commander Baji Prabhu Deshpande and, on 13 July 1660, they escaped {{in the dead of night}} to flee to Vishalgad. Baji Prabhu and a barber, Shiva Kashid, <b>who</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> Shivaji Maharaj, kept the enemy engaged, giving them an impression that Shiva Kashid was actually Shivaji Maharaj. In the ensuing battle (see Battle of Pavan Khind), almost three quarters of the one thousand strong force died, including Baji Prabhu himself. The fort went to Adil Shah. It was not until 1673 that Shivaji Maharaj could occupy it permanently.|$|E

50|$|Sexologists {{have created}} {{numerous}} terms for preferential attraction to transgender people. John Money and Malgorzata Lamacz proposed the term gynemimetophilia {{to refer to}} a sexual preference for male-assigned people <b>who</b> <b>look</b> <b>like,</b> act like, or are women, including crossdressed men and trans women. They also proposed the term andromimetophilia to describe a sexual attraction to female-assigned people <b>who</b> <b>look</b> <b>like,</b> act like, or are men.|$|R
25|$|As {{with many}} other underachieving {{baseball}} teams, a curse is believed to lurk over the Tigers. After their 1985 Japan Series win, fans celebrated by having people <b>who</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> Tigers players jump into the Dotonbori Canal. According to legend, because none of the fans resembled first baseman Randy Bass, fans grabbed a life-sized statue of Kentucky Fried Chicken mascot Colonel Sanders and threw it into the river (like Bass, the Colonel had a beard and was not Japanese). After many series without a series win, the Tigers {{were said to be}} doomed never to win the season again until the Colonel was rescued from the river.|$|E
25|$|Also on November 26, Crow Neck, a {{returning}} warrior, told Bad Man (also {{known as}} Cranky Man) {{that he had}} left an exhausted horse along the trail to rest. When {{he went back to}} retrieve the horse that day, he saw moving figures to the north <b>who</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> soldiers. Fearful, he turned back without getting his horse. Bad Man doubted Crow Neck had seen soldiers; he said perhaps he had a guilty conscience from having gone against the chiefs' wishes by joining the war party. Crow Neck told no one else what he had seen, fearing that he might be laughed at, or chastised by Black Kettle for having been part of the raid.|$|E
25|$|The {{basis for}} Southey wishing {{to write an}} epic poem came from his private reading of {{literature}} while attending Westminster School as a boy. It is possible that Southey, during this time, had problems sleeping and that an inability to sleep served as inspiration for the topic of Kehama. Additionally, a boy Southey met while at school, <b>who</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a fiend according to Southey's account, served as a prototype for the dark and mysterious character Arvalan. By 1802, Southey spent his time writing the poem along with other projects following the publication of Thalaba the Destroyer. This continued into 1806, when the epic was worked on alongside other works, such as a translation of El Cid {{and a history of}} Portugal.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{assassination}} of John F. Kennedy by Lee Harvey Oswald, {{and the release of}} the Warren Report, Cobb was privy to a conversation between Elena Garro, her sister Deva Guerrero, and her daughter. They expressed surprise at seeing Oswald's face in the newspapers, as they said they recognized him from a twist party at the home of Rubén Durán. They said that he was accompanied by two other men <b>who</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> beatniks. In an October 5 report, Cobb informed the CIA of the conversation. Cobb wanted the women to tell American authorities what they knew, but advised them against going to the American embassy, instead suggesting that they go to Texas. Cobb was asked to leave Garro's home after their cat's back legs were found broken.|$|E
25|$|In {{the eighth}} lunar month of 189, the eunuchs hatched {{a plot to}} assassinate He Jin. They issued a fake {{imperial}} order in Empress Dowager He's name, instructing He Jin to enter the palace to meet her. He Jin fell into an ambush and died {{at the hands of}} the eunuchs, who declared him guilty of treason. After He Jin's death, his subordinates Wu Kuang (吳匡) and Zhang Zhang (張璋), along with Yuan Shao, Yuan Shu and others, led their troops to storm the palace and kill the eunuchs in revenge. They indiscriminately slaughtered anyone <b>who</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a eunuch; some young men who had no facial hair, in desperation, dropped their pants in front of the soldiers to prove that they were not eunuchs. During the attack, the eunuchs took Empress Dowager He, Emperor Shao and the Prince of Chenliu (Liu Xie) hostage and tried to flee from the palace. Lu Zhi intercepted the eunuch Duan Gui (段珪) and saved the empress dowager from him. He Miao, who was sympathetic towards the eunuchs, was killed by Wu Kuang and Dong Zhuo's younger brother Dong Min (董旻). Over 2,000 people died in the attack. Emperor Shao and the Prince of Chenliu, who were taken out of the palace by the eunuchs during the chaos, were eventually found near the riverbank and saved by Lu Zhi and Min Gong (閔貢), who brought them back safely.|$|E

According to Hoshino's first editor, Allen was originally going to be a modified Akuma <b>who</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a boy.

500|$|Harrington handed former SDS {{activist and}} New York City {{journalist}} Jack Newfield {{a speech by}} AFL–CIO President George Meany. Addressing the September 1972 Convention of the United Steelworkers of America, Meany ridiculed the Democratic Party Convention, which had been held in Miami: We heard from the gay-lib [...] {{people who want to}} legalize marriage between boys and boys, and between girls and girls... We heard from the people <b>who</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> Jacks, acted like Jills, and had the odor of Johns [...] about them. This gay-baiting taunt was attributed to Kahn by Harrington, and repeated by Newfield in his autobiography. [...] Maurice Isserman's biography of Harrington also described this speech as Kahn's selfhatred, as [...] "Kahn's resort to gaybashing".|$|E
500|$|At {{this point}} they claimed that {{a feeling of}} oppression and dreariness came over them.

Moberly later described the men as [...] "very dignified officials, dressed in long greyish green coats with small three-cornered hats." [...] Jourdain noticed a cottage with {{a woman and a}} girl in the doorway. The woman was holding out a jug to the girl. Jourdain described it as a [...] "tableau vivant", a living picture, much like Madame Tussauds waxworks. Moberly did not observe the cottage, but felt the atmosphere change. She wrote: [...] "Everything suddenly looked unnatural, therefore unpleasant; even the trees seemed to become flat and lifeless, like wood worked in tapestry.

She later informed friends that during the Second World War, George had served in the Royal Navy while she served in the Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS), although such claims have never been corroborated. Gerald Gardner, founder of Gardnerian Wicca – known for his unreliable stories – claimed that he met Montalban during the war, when she was wearing a WRNS uniform, and that at the time she was working as a [...] "personal clairvoyant and psychic advisor" [...] to Lord Louis Mountbatten.

500|$|The episode's {{title is}} a {{reference}} to the film Viva Las Vegas (1964). The panic and smoke cloud generated from the implosion of Mr Burns' casino is reminiscent of the 1997 disaster film Dante's Peak, and the Simpson family's escape from the smoke cloud is {{a reference to}} a scene in the 1996 science fiction film Independence Day. Outside Rev. Lovejoy's church is a notice that today's sermon will be 'He Knows What You Did Last Summer', which is {{a reference to the}} title of the 1997 slasher film I Know What You Did Last Summer. As Homer and Ned escape from Vegas, a snippet of the theme from the 1996 comic science fiction film Mars Attacks! can be heard. The Comic Book Guy's license plate is NCC-1701, which is also the registration of the USS Enterprise, a fictional starship from the Star Trek media franchise.
