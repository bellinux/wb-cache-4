40|$|Passenger cars {{represent}} the largest {{part of all}} means of personal transportation today. Thus, {{it is important to}} work towards reduced energy consumption of cars if a sustainable mobility is to be achieved. This involves many aspects of vehicle engineering; one of them being aerodynamics. This study focuses on aerodynamic drag and the contributions from the wheels at different cooling air flow configurations. Wheels and wheel housings are important for the overall aerodynamic drag on passenger cars. It has been shown that as much as 25 % of the aerodynamic drag originates from these components. Therefore, it is desirable to understand the flow structures related to the wheels and wheel housings, and how they interact with other important flow regions. This paper presents an investigation of the effects of wheel designs on aerodynamic drag at different cooling air flow configurations on a sedan type passenger car. Comparisons between numerical simulations and wind tunnel measurements are made for some of the configurations as well. Several additional wheel configurations were investigated numerically to further investigate the flow structures at the front and rear wheels. The numerical results show that the effects of radial <b>wheel</b> <b>covering</b> varied noticeably with cooling air flow configuration. In two of the configurations this resulted in a net drag increase with closed cooling air inlets. The best configuration with closed cooling air inlets generated an overall drag reduction of 29 drag counts compared with the numerical baseline with open cooling air inlets. In addition to the obvious drag reduction of closing the cooling air inlets, the main reasons for the additional decrease was limiting the drag increase at the front stagnation region and positive interference effects along the underbody and vehicle base...|$|E

Aimed at fleet buyers, this new variant added full plastic <b>wheel</b> <b>coverings,</b> standard power steering and manual or automatic transmission with air conditioning as the sole option. The luxury-oriented models—SE and Elite—featured higher equipment: seats were covered in velour trim with the driver's seat being seven-way adjustable (instead of four-way); lumbar support for driver and passenger; rear integrated headrests and folding centre armrest with boot access; map lights and remote boot release; power windows, central locking and alloy wheels (standard on Elite and optional on SE); metallic paint standard (two-tone standard on Elite and single-tone optional on Elite and SE); radio/cassette players (featuring a novel security system {{that would make the}} unit completely inoperable in the event that its power was disconnected) with the Elite also adding a rear quarter panel electric antenna, separate equaliser and steering wheel controls. In addition, instead of standard control steering stalks and ventilation panel on the centre console, both the SE and Elite had two steering side pods, thus bringing all major controls within a driver's fingertips and making them jointly height adjustable with the steering column. Elite also featured an LCD instrument panel, in line with the Japanese automotive trend in the late 1980s. Common to all models were a tilt adjustable steering and cable-operated fuel filler door release. Non-Elite models also had a roof mounted manual antenna above the right A-pillar and the following optional equipment: air conditioning (GLX, Executive and SE), power steering and automatic transmission (GLX and SE).|$|R

25|$|In {{conjunction}} with {{various forms of}} artillery, the Macedonians possessed the ability to build an effective array of siege engines. Prominent {{in a number of}} sieges, including the epic Siege of Tyre (332 BC), were siege towers; these allowed men to approach and assault the enemy walls without being exposed to potentially withering missile fire. Equally, they meant that more men could be put on the walls in a shorter period of time, as simple ladders constrained the men attacking to moving up in single file, thus making the task of defending the walls far easier. These structures, which were wheeled and several stories high, were covered with wet hide or metal sheathing to protect from missile fire, especially incendiaries, and the largest might be equipped with artillery. The Macedonian army could also deploy various forms of suspended, metal-tipped, rams. Such rams were usually provided with a <b>wheeled,</b> roofed <b>covering</b> to protect their users from missile fire; they were employed to batter down gates or to dislodge masonry from walls and so cause a breach (this latter form was sometimes called a 'drill' rather than a ram).|$|R

40|$|Abstract — An {{increasing}} number of wearable and mobile devices are capable of automatically sensing and recording rich information about the surrounding environment. To make use of such data, it is desirable for each data point to be matched with its corresponding spatial location. We focus on using the trajectory from a device’s odometry sensors that reveal changes in motion over time. Our goal is to recover the route traversed, which we will define as a sequence of revisitable positions. Dead reckoning, which computes the device’s route from its odometry trajectory, is known to suffer from significant drift over time. We aim to overcome drift errors by reshaping the odometry trajectory to fit the constraints of a given topological map and sensor noise model. Prior works use iterative search algorithms that are susceptible to local maximas [15], {{which means that they}} can be misled when faced with ambiguous decisions. In contrast, our algorithm is able to find the set of all routes within the given constraints. This also reveals if there are multiple routes that are similarly likely. We can then rank them and select the optimal route that is most likely to be the actual route. We also show that the algorithm can be extended to recover routes even in the presence of topological map errors. We evaluate our algorithm by recovering all routes traversed by a <b>wheeled</b> robot <b>covering</b> over 9 kilometers from its odometry sensor data. I...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to evaluate the performance of seed drill with different covering devices of wheat seeds. The parameters used for evaluation were draft, seed depth, fuel consumption, number of plants/mt, power requirement and length of plant root. The experiment was designed as split plot and the main plot was the seed covering devices and the sub plot was forward speed. An instrumented tractor was used that consisted of sensitive sensors and a datalogger for measuring and recording performance parameters including fuel consumption, tractor forward speed and draft. Experiments were conducted with four types of seed covering devices named: spike tooth, wooden sweep, chains and smooth plastic wheel. Seed drill performance parameters were measured at various forward speeds (5. 94, 6. 53 and 7. 65 kmIh) and the planting depth was adjusted on 50 mm before planting. The results showed that there were significant differences among the used seed covering devices and forward speeds for all performance parameters were found. The spike tooth seed covering device had the smallest average value of draft compared with the other seed covering devices and was equal to 3. 85 kN as average for three forward speeds. On the other hand, the smooth plastic <b>wheel</b> seed <b>covering</b> device had the smallest average values of fuel consumption and seed depth, and big~est average values of length of plant root and number of plants/m compared with the other seed covering devices and were equal to 16. 36 litlh, 53. 11 rnm, 94. 3 rnm, and 174 plants/m' respectively as average for the three forward speeds...|$|R
40|$|South Africa has the {{potential}} to serve as a bridge between large scale farming in developed nations and the small scale operations of subsistence farmers in developing nations. It has a mix of both large-scale modern farms and small farms, which use a range of different farming practices and products. There is a gap between the tractors used by large scale South African farmers and the equipment available to the small farm holders. This research effort aims to fill a portion of that gap. There is a particular need for implements that take advantage of newer conservation methods, such as no-till, and make that technology available for small farm holders. International shipping tends to be costly, increasing the end cost of planters manufactured in other countries, making in-country manufacturing desirable. The objectives of this work included designing, building, and testing a small animal-drawn no-till planter that could be manufactured in a rural town in South Africa and is simple and easy for men, women and older children to use. A prototype was manufactured with basic machine shop equipment and skills. The prototype was then refined and tested. Measurements included draft, seed depth, and seed spacing, with cowpeas used as a representative crop. The average draft for the prototype was 796 N (179 lbf), low enough to be pulled by two draft animals weighing 816. 5 kg (1800 lbs) total. The target seed placement depth for cowpeas of 2 cm was achieved within 25 % most of the time, and the target seed spacing of 10 cm was achieved within 50 %. The residue managers for moving straw from the row, and the press <b>wheels</b> for <b>covering</b> the seed with soil, both performed their intended functions. The planter was also found to be easy to lift at the tongue with one hand and easily operated from the side from which animals are typically driven. This planter could meet the planting and conservation needs of many small farm holders who have access to animal power but not to machine power...|$|R
50|$|Quattro car {{production}} was 11,452 vehicles {{over the period}} 1980-1991, and through this 11 year production span, despite some touch-ups, there were no {{major changes in the}} visual design of the vehicle. For the 1983 model year, the dash was switched from an analogue instrument cluster, to a green digital liquid crystal display (LCD) electronic instrument cluster. This was later changed in 1988 to an orange LCD electronic instrument cluster. The interior was redesigned in 1984, and featured a whole new dash layout, new steering wheel design, and new centre console design, the switches around the instrument panel were also redesigned at this time. In 1985 the dash changed slightly with harder foam and lost a diagonal stripe, the dash switches were varied slightly and the diff lock pull knob gave way to a two-position turning knob with volt and oil temp digital readouts.External styling received very little modification during its production run. Originally, the car had a flat fronted grille featuring four separate headlamplenses, one for each of the low and high beam units. This was altered for the 1983 model year, and replaced with combined units featuring a single lens, but housing twin reflectors. This was changed again, for the 1985 model year, in what has become known as the 'facelift model' and included such alterations as a new sloping front grille, headlights, and trim and badging changes. Max speed was 124 mph. The RR 20v Quattro also featured a new three spoke steering <b>wheel</b> design, leather <b>covering</b> for door arm rests, gloveboxes, centre console and door pockets. There was also a full length leather-wrapped centre console running {{all the way to the}} rear seats. The 20v was also the first Ur-Q to have 'quattro' script interior with partial leather seats. The floor on the driver's side had a bulge due to dual catalytic exhaust setup. The different models may be distinguished by the emblems on their boot lids: the WR had a vinyl 'quattro' decal or a brushed aluminium effect plastic emblem, the MB had chrome plated 'Audi', 'Audi rings' and 'quattro' emblems, whilst the RR had only chrome plated 'Audi rings'.|$|R
