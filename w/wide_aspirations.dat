Using policy documents and interview data with education policy makers, it discusses some major concerns with such a policy for a country where child labour is already a widespread national phenomenon. This paper argues that such a policy emphasis may blur the boundaries of where children’s involvement in work ceases to be at an acceptable level. It also argues that the emphasis on local life skills, mainly of an agricultural nature, may hinder the development of children’s <b>wider</b> <b>aspirations</b> for social mobility by focusing them on what is familiar and immediately relevant to their current living conditions...|$|R
40|$|The revised {{professional}} {{standards for the}} teaching profession in Scotland are underpinned {{by a set of}} values which includes a detailed articulation of social justice for education covering rights, diversity and sustainability. There is a future orientation in these standards that privileges the contribution of teachers and leaders to realizing a <b>wider</b> social <b>aspiration</b> for social justice. This expectation on leaders to contribute to this <b>wider</b> <b>aspiration</b> for social justice raises questions about the practice of leaders and their development. This article considers the implications of the articulation of social justice in the {{professional standards}} for career-long leadership development. The article explores some of the issues related to social justice and the role of leadership in school. The article then focuses on the context of Scottish education, looking firstly at the professional standards and secondly at the issues related to social justice leadership. From this discussion the implications for career-long leadership development are considered. The article concludes with a framework for social justice leadership development identifying key aspects of values, knowledge and understanding, inclusive practice, policy, issues of equity and equality that can be developed progressively across a leadership development continuum...|$|R
30|$|Finally, the TransMilenio {{has had a}} huge {{worldwide}} impact. It {{has been}} the main element used to demonstrate the new course of Bogotá, promoting its regeneration {{as a model for}} the main Global South metropolises striving to improve the quality of their urban life. More importantly, the BRT has become one leading reference for public transport strategies in developing countries (United Nations Human Settlements Programme 2013). Its success does not rely only on the technical relevance of the project, but also on its social and political meaning: TransMilenio is a ‘Southern innovation’ that intercepts the <b>wider</b> <b>aspirations,</b> ideologies and positioning of other cities in the Global South (Wood 2015). Though inspired on the experience of Curitiba, Bogotá could replicate on a wider scale the implementation of a BRT system, becoming thus a reference for many other cities from Latin America, Asia and Africa. Nonetheless, even at a global scale the promotion of a feasible technical solution to achieve desired sociopolitical aims has been partially successful, as numerous examples—even positive ones—demonstrate (Oviedo Hernandez and Joshi 2016).|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} some of {{the issues}} emerging thus far from the Accomplished Teaching Project, funded by the Scottish Government and GTCS. The dominant models of change have tended to focus on the importing of ideas externally through policy-based initiatives with task groups established to implement the priorities. Such approaches can lead to a tokenistic response to policy imperatives which are not sustained, nor do they lead to the revisiting of education and of practice necessary to address <b>wider</b> <b>aspirations.</b> Therefore we need to move to models of professional learning that recognise and enhance the expertise of the teacher. It begins by exploring {{some of the}} hindering and facilitating factors in initiating teacher-led practice-based collaborative professional learning. The paper then goes on to consider some of the questions emerging, particularly in the placing of teachers as the experts in generating and sustaining innovative approaches to teaching and learning. This raises questions about our understanding of the expert teacher (Berliner, 1988; 2001; 2004; Hammerstein, 2006). From both academic and policy explorations the idea of the expert teaching is still a loose (Glaser, 1988; Dreyfus and Dreyfus, 1986; Schon, 1983) model – which may be part of its strength. However, we can probe the idea of an expert teacher further by examining the concept of 'expertise' (Collins and Evans, 2007) ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{review of}} the album for Rolling Stone {{discussed}} how many of Jim Kerr's lyrics {{can be interpreted as}} religious references, such as The Bible in [...] "Book of Brilliant Things", or redemption at the Christian cross in [...] "East at Easter". [...] "Simple Minds find religious illumination in the vertigo of their fertile imaginations," [...] wrote Parke Puterbaugh, [...] "and it comes out as psychedelic testifying - all fast movement and kaleidoscopic repetition - that builds to a crescendo of ecstasy and release." [...] Hence, the subject matter on Sparkle in the Rain can be seen as more outward-looking and aspirational than on more introspective tracks such as [...] "Someone Somewhere in Summertime" [...] on the preceding album. For example, [...] "Waterfront" [...] was written as both a eulogy to their place of origin Glasgow and as a celebration of much <b>wider</b> <b>aspirations</b> to recover its once-thriving industry. Jim Kerr, stating that the song's lyrics were inspired by the ruined shipbuilding sector on the River Clyde, said [...] "you always see your home town differently when you come back...I became aware of a grander scheme of things," [...] although Puterbaugh speculated that lyrics such as [...] "Get in, get out of the rain" [...] and [...] "...move on up to the waterfront" [...] may relate to [...] "baptismal immersion or death".|$|R

5|$|Before the war, {{nationalism}} {{had been}} largely absent in officers of the Austro-Hungarian Army, but this changed during the war, {{and by the end}} of the war, the propaganda of the Entente had combined with <b>wider</b> <b>aspirations</b> to encourage nationalist sentiment. In some cases, this resulted in mutiny among units of the Austro-Hungarian Army in the last months of the war. The states that would succeed Austria-Hungary were approved by the Allies on 28 October 1918, and the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary was dissolved three days later. Many new nation states emerged in the territory formerly belonging to the realm, as nationalist movements called for greater autonomy or full independence. The Duchy of Styria was divided between the new states of German-Austria and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, but the exact line of the new border was unclear. In November 1918, Mikl had returned to his hometown of Radkersburg, an important railway junction point, which was of economic importance to both sides. The Slovenes occupied the city on 1 December 1918. In 1919, Mikl served as adjutant in the 1st Battalion of the Volkswehr militia, which used arms provided by the provincial government of Carinthia to make an unsuccessful attempt to recapture Radkersburg from forces of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes to ensure it remained part of German-Austria. The provincial government of Styria, which had not supported these actions, subsequently issued a warrant ordering Mikl's arrest for treason. Despite his failure, his actions were very important in demonstrating to those negotiating the final border that towns along the northern bank of the Mura river were German. When the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye was signed later in 1919, Radkersburg was retained within what became the First Austrian Republic.|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} {{facilitation}} skills and expertise explored from practitioners' own perspectives. It presents {{a series of}} 'reflective dialogues' stimulated by re-viewing video recorded sessions. Initial observations capture detailed moments of facilitation in action within a range of community and participatory theatre settings. The subsequent discussions evidence how practitioners' concerns go beyond the detail of practice and indicate how their own theoretical discourses inform choices made in the moment. The dialogues reveal how theatre practitioners within applied or community contexts demonstrate {{more than just the}} ability to provide non-professionals access to artistic processes. They make additional decisions which seek to enhance the potential social and personal outcomes of participatory arts. The chapter explores the detail of how these wider imperatives inform in-action decisions, and how practitioners’ choices are made within well-constructed and philosophical frameworks. Examples show how practitioners blend theory and practice which can enable change through the work for the participants, and, indeed, for themselves. The chapter will explore how, during the reflective dialogues, practitioners not only analysed particular choices they made in action. They also responded by interweaving commentary on tiny details of practice with their <b>wider</b> <b>aspirations</b> and theories for the work. They evidenced how expertise is composed not just of what the practitioner does, but also by an ability to grow the work and grow within the work. Practitioners are constantly reflecting on their work: in planning, in the moment, and in hindsight. The practitioners here analyse how they too benefit from the work, through inter-action and collaboration with the participants. The chapter builds on reflective practitioner models, proposing that adding theoretical underpinning can benefit both the participants and the practitioners. Reflecting the journeys made by the participants, the practitioners here demonstrate their particular expertise not by presenting themselves as knowing experts, but by opening themselves to applied theatre’s philosophy of change...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} motivations and {{meanings}} of international student mobility. Central {{to the discussion}} are {{the results of a}} large questionnaire survey and associated in-depth interviews with UK students enrolled in universities in six countries from around the world. The results suggest, first, that several different dimensions of social and cultural capital are accrued through study abroad. It is argued that the search for ‘world class’ education has taken on new significance. Second, the paper argues that analysis of student mobility should not be confined to a framework that separates study abroad from the <b>wider</b> life-course <b>aspirations</b> of students. It is argued that these insights go beyond existing theorisations of international student mobility to incorporate recognition of diverse approaches to difference within cultures of mobility, including class reproduction of distinction, broader notions of distinction within the life-plans of individual students, and how ‘reputations’ associated with educational destinations are structured by individuals, institutions and states in a global higher education system that produces differentially mediated geographies of international student mobilit...|$|R

40|$|Looking at early {{examples}} of amateur filmmaking {{from the period}} 1923 - 1939, which have been deposited in New Zealand's national film archive, Ngā Taonga Sound and Vision, this thesis considers how amateur practice both relates to and deviates from other contemporary forms of visual culture such as professional cinema. Internationally, scholars and archivists have recently begun to examine ways that amateur films or home movies, which document personal, local and everyday experience, supplement other sources of visual history. There have, however, been few studies to date of this aspect of New Zealand's film history. While the idiosyncratic language of films intended for private use complicates their interpretation in an archive, {{it is argued that}} home movies display a 'referential coherence' in relation to other media, which offers a way of understanding amateur films as historical documents in the public domain. This relationship is explored looking at holiday films recorded at a popular sightseeing destination and films depicting working life on sheep farms. Portrayed as an exotic wonderland with spectacular geothermal activity and authentic Māori culture on display, Rotorua, as seen in promotional media, exemplified the widespread representation of New Zealand as a scenic playground. Amateur films offer a more ambivalent view of the tourist locality's geography and inhabitants. Made by outsiders familiar with popular representations, amateur tourist films resemble the imagery of professional media in many respects, however, they do so largely without articulating the simplistic narratives of publicity material. Picturesque images depicting rural New Zealand as an idyllic pastoral paradise have a long history across a wide range of media. While idealised scenic views of the countryside, which consistently ignored the social realities of rural existence, appear to presuppose the unfamiliar gaze of an (urban) outsider, rural residents recorded their own impressions of their surroundings on film. Less concerned with scenery than with the scene of daily life, amateur farming films document specific concrete experiences in a particular time and place, yet simultaneously appear to share, if not so much the iconography or aesthetics of professional media, {{at least some of the}} <b>wider</b> <b>aspirations</b> of cultural discourses in circulation. It may be concluded therefore that the study of amateur media production contributes to an understanding of how individuals and groups internalise and reproduce, or alternatively disregard, prevailing social ideologies...|$|R
40|$|Many media organisations are {{businesses}} {{driven by}} commercial motives. But {{the activities of}} media have both economic and socio-cultural ramifications. While the industry {{is made up of}} both non-market participants (such as the BBC) and commercial firms, questions about ethics and values apply to both constituencies because, whether media organisations like it or not, the ability to communicate with audiences, which is their raison d’être, is inseparable from concomitant welfare implications for society. Not surprisingly then, media organisations are subject to various forms of intervention on the part of state authorities. Such interventions reflect not only the usual sorts of economic and industrial policy concerns such as growth and efficiency, but also a wide range of special considerations stemming specifically from the unique and important ways in which mass communications can affect society. This chapter analyses how conflict may arise between the objectives of profit maximization, which naturally shape the activities of many media firms, and promotion of <b>wider</b> societal <b>aspirations</b> and values. It also examines some of the main solutions and measures through which public interest priorities can be brought into alignment with self-interested corporate goals...|$|R
40|$|High-level {{consensus}} about safeguarding ecosystemservices for optimal benefits to {{society is not}} yet matched by transposition to field scale. Various ‘societal levers’ – markets, statutory legislation, common/civil law, market-based instruments and protocols – have evolved as a fragmented policy environment of incentives and constraints, influencing the freedoms of resource owners. This has produced mosaic landscapes reflecting both natural conditions and landowner aspirations. The Principles of the Ecosystem Approach serve as a framework to consider three case study sites: an English lowland estuary and two in Scotland. Societal levers today safeguard some socially valuable services, but the present policy environment is neither sufficient nor sufficiently integrated to achieve coherence between the choices of resource owners and <b>wider</b> societal <b>aspirations</b> for ecosystem service provision. The heterogeneity of societal levers protects freedom of choice, enables adaptive decision-making related to {{the properties of the}} natural resource, and makes allowance for changes in societal preferences. Resultant mosaic landscapes provide flexibility and resilience in ecosystem service production. However, further evolution of societal levers is required to bring about greater coherence of ecosystem service production from local to national/international scales.

40|$|Confronted by the {{increasingly}} changing and varied nature of disabilities {{in higher education}} (Bowe, 2000; McGuire & Scott, 2002), disability service providers across North America are progressively moving away from targeted remedial assistance focusing on the disabilities of students to a less frontline role involving the sensitization of faculty around strategies that seek to widen access and develop awareness (Sopko, 2008). Universal Design is hence often the model of choice (Rose, Harbour, Johnston, Daley, & Abarbanell, 2006).

60|$|Indeed, {{that came}} about without the writer's intention. So {{it was the}} summoned vision came. For I see about me a great {{multitude}} of little souls and groups of souls as darkened, as derivative as my own; {{with the passage of}} years I understand more and more clearly the quality of the motives that urge me and urge them to do whatever we do.... Yet that is not all I see, and I am not altogether bounded by my littleness. Ever and again, contrasting with this immediate vision, come glimpses of a comprehensive scheme, in which these personalities float, the scheme of a synthetic wider being, the great State, mankind, in which we all move and go, like blood corpuscles, like nerve cells, it may be at times like brain cells, in the body of a man. But the two visions are not seen consistently together, at least by me, and I do not surely know that they exist consistently together. The motives needed for those wider issues come not into the interplay of my vanities and wishes. That greater scheme lies about the men and women I know, as I have tried to make the vistas and spaces, the mountains, cities, laws, and order of Utopia lie about my talking couple, too great for their sustained comprehension. When one focuses upon these two that wide landscape becomes indistinct and distant, and when one regards that then the real persons one knows grow vague and unreal. Nevertheless, I cannot separate these two aspects of human life, each commenting on the other. In that incongruity between great and individual inheres the incompatibility I could not resolve, and which, therefore, I have had to present in this conflicting form. At times that great scheme does seem to me to enter certain men's lives as a passion, as a real and living motive; there are those who know it almost {{as if it was a}} thing of desire; even for me, upon occasion, the little lures of the immediate life are seen small and vain, and the soul goes out to that mighty Being, to apprehend it and serve it and possess. But this is an illumination that passes as it comes, a rare transitory lucidity, leaving the soul's desire suddenly turned to presumption and hypocrisy upon the lips. One grasps at the Universe and attains--Bathos. The hungers, the jealousies, the prejudices and habits have us again, and we are forced back to think that it is so, and not otherwise, that we are meant to serve the mysteries; that in these blinkers it is we are driven to an end we cannot understand. And then, for measured moments in the night watches or as one walks alone or while one sits in thought and speech with a friend, the <b>wider</b> <b>aspirations</b> glow again with a sincere emotion, with the colours of attainable desire....|$|R

The transport sector in particular is finding it difficult to reduce CO 2 emissions. This paper reports on two studies {{carried out by the}} authors in London (UK) and Delhi (India). It considers the common objectives for transport CO 2 reduction, but the very different contexts and baselines, potentials for change and some possible synergies.,, Different packages of measures are selected and scenarios developed for each context which are consistent with contraction and convergence objectives. CO 2 reduction potentials are modelled and quantified by package and scenario. London is considering deep reductions on current transport CO 2 emission levels; Delhi is seeking to break the huge projected rise in transport CO 2 emissions.,, The scale of policy intervention required to achieve these goals is huge and there is certainly little public discussion of the magnitude of the changes required. The paper argues for a ‘strategic conversation’ at the city level, using scenario analysis, to discuss the priorities for intervention in delivering low carbon transport futures. A greater focus is required in developing participatory approaches to decision making, alongside network investments, urban planning, low emission vehicles and <b>wider</b> initiatives. <b>Aspirations</b> towards equitable target emissions may assist in setting sufficiently demanding targets.

40|$|The {{examination}} of the topic of market risk management in Islamic finance is a complex endeavour. At a basic level, the subject matter, being multifarious {{in a manner that}} mixes religion and economics, requires the conjoining of religious faith with scientific objectivity in order to ascertain the truth contained in the scripture as it pertains to the Mua’amalat (dealings between individuals) matter of entering into financial contracts with others to manage market risk exposures. Moreover, the complexity is compounded due to the need to disentangle the ambiguity that has beset the discourse on the topic due to historically being mostly legal-centric with a focus on debating the contractual elements rather than attempting to comprehensively address the myriad issues that relate to market risk management in contemporary contexts. These issues, for the most part, revolve around the reliance on market risk transfer as a strategy and derivative contracts, with monetary underlying variables, as tools to implement that strategy. Thus, the journey of investigating the rationale, permissibility, and usage of derivative hedging instruments for market risk management in Islamic finance is, essentially, an undertaking that seeks to engage in a wide-ranging and multi-layered {{examination of}} the subject matter as well as the exploration of new areas of relative significance. This, in turn, and subsequent to the analysis of data generated from documentary sources and forty-one interviews which were collected from numerous sources within four locations, led to the elaboration of the contention that market risk management through derivative instruments for legitimate hedging purposes should not be prohibited in the Shari’a, albeit with certain conditions that limit unproductive behaviour. The basis for the aforementioned contention is built on the fact that market risk management has undergone a paradigm shift in how exposures are identified and measured {{as well as in the}} emergence of innovative tools which can result in a better ability to address the opportunities and challenges facing institutions that provide value to society (i. e., the real sector). Moreover, there is little substantive evidence that proves that the utilization of derivative instruments for hedging purposes leads its users to partaking in transactions that circumvent the prohibition of Riba (usury), Gharar (excessive uncertainty), and Maysir (gambling). In effect, the derivative instruments used for the management of market risks are not only disassociated from usurious debt transactions, they are also transacted in the financial markets in a manner that is transparent to all the parties involved. Along the same lines, the prohibition of Maysir, which is apparently an overarching concern, should be conceptualized with the focus on the proscription of the act of gambling, not necessarily the instruments (e. g., derivatives) and/or any particular framework (e. g., zero-sum arrangements). Ultimately, one should be cognizant of the fact that the true intentions of Islamic jurisprudence in Mua’amalat (as a manifestation of divine guidance) always centre on human well-being. Accordingly, the religious prohibitions are, in essence, within the realm of acts that adversely affect human well-being. This is a constant theme that is present throughout the thesis; and is one that exists at the heart of a <b>wider</b> <b>aspiration</b> of its adoption to a greater extent than is currently present in the Islamic finance discourse...|$|R

The authority have made the commitment that all teachers and supportstaff will be trained in cooperative learning, if they wish, over a period of at least 5 years. Since theintroduction of A Curriculum for Excellence, the authority has been emphasising the strengths ofcooperative learning in supporting the development of the four capacities (successful learners,confident individuals, responsible citizens and effective contributors to society). They also believe that it provides a suitable medium for taking forward other national initiatives such asAssessment is for Learning and Enterprise in Education...|$|R
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{presents the}} analytical framework, research set-up and initial empirical operationalization {{of an early}} stage PhD research (Month 12) on the governance of Alternative Food Networks. Alternative Food Networks are alternative modes of organizing actors, resources and processes of the food chain, linking more closely food production with consumption. Civil society actors, such as activists, citizens’ groups, cooperatives, or several types of grass-root organizations, have {{an active role in}} catalyzing Alternative Food Networks. Such agents are often highly value driven, matching local action with <b>wider</b> <b>aspirations</b> of socio-ecological transition. Furthermore, such actors need to rely on supportive institutions for important aspects: among others, funding schemes, political visibility, recognition and support. However, the institutional environment with which alternative food initiatives are confronted, is not always favorable and accountable. Changes in political priorities, precariousness of land agreements, constraining regulations affecting bottom-up initiatives, are some examples of such tensions. Disentangling the politics of urban food transitions, the research focuses on both, the internal governance dynamics of urban food initiatives {{as well as on the}} relation with key external agents and multi-scaled institutions. What are the internal incentives fostering organizational dynamics in grass-root urban food projects? What kind of relations and adaptations such initiatives develop with a wider range of institutional and urban actors? The Brussels-Capital Region is the main empirical case study in which such questions are tested. The research starts from the analysis of key grass-root movements or intermediary organizations establishing alternative food projects. The GASAP movement, a spatially extended Community Supported Agriculture, and the urban agriculture organization “Le Debut des Haricots”, are among the main cases selected. The research develops a diachronic analysis of such movements and their ways of developing and diversifying. Attention is paid to the horizontal relations with other initiatives or networks as well as to the areas of intersection with institutional agents, political programs, funding schemes, at the municipal, regional and wider institutional scales. The empirical work is informed by a theoretical framework which identifies key governance tensions, i. e. organizational, institutional, power and spatial tensions. Organizational tensions refer to the internal governance dynamics of Alternative Food Networks, i. e. the need to foster trust and cooperative linkages among the participants. Institutional tensions connect to the external governance, highlighting frictions between the informal/customary rules of Alternative Food Initiatives and the broader system of multi-scaled institutions with which such initiatives interact. Institutional tensions are directly linked to power tensions, which concern the need for empowerment and representation of alternative food actors. Spatial tensions refer to frictions in the use of space, when Alternative Food Initiatives need to secure land, open new markets, or develop alternative supply systems. This framework combines elements from different governance traditions, i. e. social innovation theories (González et al. 2010; Moulaert et al. 2005, 2010, 2013), sustainability transitions (Shove E, Walker G, 2007; Smith 2011) and the governance of Socio-Ecological Systems (Folke et al. 2005 b; Cash et al. 2006). Looking at governance relations from both, a bottom-up as well as from an institutional perspective, this research aims at bridging knowledge gaps in governance traditions, which mostly lack of such an integrated understanding. Furthermore, the research aims at opening new insights on institutional tools or political arenas that better match the aspirations of bottom-up initiatives with the political economy of decision-making of relevant policy actors. status: accepte...|$|R
40|$|Field {{studies of}} {{management}} control and accounting {{have tended to}} study organisational meaning through practices. We identify three strands of practice research on organisational control (viz., governmentality, actor network theory, and accountability) and propose a forth: cultural practice. The study of control as cultural practice is grounded in observation because it conceives of cultural knowledge as practical and largely extra-linguistic. It conceptualises organisational control as an effect of the actions and ideas of organisational members beyond the ranks of management, thus widening the field of empirical inquiry. It also makes studies of steady state organisations more attractive thereby opening {{the possibility that the}} assemblages of people, purposes, and technologies, which give rise to specific forms of organisational control, may be understood as less ephemeral than, particularly, studies of governmentality and actor network theory have suggested. Our ethnography of a steel mill in Sheffield is based on 11 months of participant observation on the shop floors of the hot and cold departments. We argue that the subcultures of different shop floors were constituted in practices of control which enabled organisational members to pursue diverse objectives that were related to their various <b>wider</b> cultural <b>aspirations.</b> Organisational control practices relied on diverse accountings and accounts of organisational actions and purposes. Whilst we found considerable diversity between subcultures, we also found that individual subcultures, and the tensions and contradictions within them, exhibited much continuity. The ability of studies of organisational subcultures to bring out the diversity as well as continuity of practices holds considerable potential for our understanding of organisational control.

40|$|CCI {{supports}} the federation government’s initiative {{to develop a}} National Cultural Policy, the first since Creative Nation in 1994. From the <b>wide</b> raft of <b>aspirations,</b> intentions and possibilities embodied in the Discussion Paper, this looks {{to be much more}} than business-as-usual in cultural policy. We commend what arts minister Simon Crean has said he wants from the policy process: ‘joining the dots’, bringing culture into contact with the education ‘revolution’, with technology and innovation, and with its role in binding the social fabric of the nation. In our submission, we draw on CCI research to outline several key issues we think a broad-based National Cultural Policy should concern itself with: (1) creative employment and education; (2) regional development and closing the cultural divide; and (3) new models of government support. Each of these issues clearly implicate all four policy goals outlined in the Discussion Paper – in terms of reflecting the diversity of Australia and its culture, increasing access and participation (especially through emerging technology such as the NBN), supporting the best of our cultural projects and people here and abroad, and strengthening the broader socio-economic contribution of this culture. In support of our submission, and to provide further background information, we have attached several of CCI’s most relevant recent research articles...|$|R
