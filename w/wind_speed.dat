5|$|Five ships {{recorded}} {{tropical storm}} force winds {{in association with}} Arthur, of which two were when the storm was extratropical. Early on July 16, a vessel with the call sign Weston reported sustained winds of 51mph (82km/h) from the south-southwest, which was the strongest ship reported <b>wind</b> <b>speed.</b> As the storm approached Canada as an extratropical storm, a buoy reported an 8minute average <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> of 45mph (72km/h), along with a wind gust of 60mph (97km/h).|$|E
5|$|To assess {{prospective}} {{wind power}} sites a {{probability distribution function}} is often fit to the observed <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> data. Different locations will have different <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> distributions. The Weibull model closely mirrors the actual distribution of hourly/ten-minute wind speeds at many locations. The Weibull factor is often close to 2 and therefore a Rayleigh distribution {{can be used as}} a less accurate, but simpler model.|$|E
5|$|Accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) {{is used by}} the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration {{and other}} {{agencies}} to express the activity of individual tropical cyclones that are above tropical storm strength and entire tropical cyclone seasons. It is calculated by taking the squares of the estimated maximum sustained velocity of every active tropical storm (<b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> 35 knots or higher) at six-hour intervals. The numbers are usually divided by 10,000 to make them more manageable. The unit of ACE is 104 kn2, and for use as an index the unit is assumed. As well as being squared for ACE, <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> can also be cubed, which {{is referred to as the}} Power Dissipation Index (PDI).|$|E

40|$|Sea surface images {{obtained}} {{during the}} 2006 Marine Aerosol Production (MAP) {{campaign in the}} North East Atlantic were analysed for values of percentage whitecap coverage (W). Values of W are presented for <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> up to circa 23 m s- 1. The W data {{were divided into two}} overlapping groups and a piecewise, wind-speed-only parameterization of W is proposed that is valid for <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> between 3. 70 m s- 1 and 23. 09 m s- 1. Segregation of data points based upon a 2. 5 hour wind history acted to decrease data scatter at <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> above approximately 9. 25 m s- 1. At these <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> W values were greater for decreasing <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> than for increasing <b>wind</b> <b>speeds.</b> No clear <b>wind</b> history effect was observed at <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> below 9. 25 m s- 1.

30|$|In {{order to}} examine the {{existence}} of the spatial dispersion of <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> and its influence on the forecasting error of total wind power in a wind farm, operating data including <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> and <b>wind</b> powers of 3 wind farms have been collected and used in the case studies. The relationship between the spatial dispersion of <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> and calculated error of wind power is analyzed.|$|R
5|$|As {{described}} earlier, prevailing {{and local}} winds are not spread evenly across the earth, {{which means that}} wind speeds also differ by region. In addition, the <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> also increases with the altitude.|$|E
5|$|The player {{may choose}} one of two courses: the Royal Troon Golf Club and the Old Course at St. Andrews. The player's caddie {{provides}} information about the pitfalls and idiosyncrasies of each course. The game simulates the strong wind and weather typical of the courses' real-world counterparts, which lie near the seaside. The player may adjust environmental aspects such as weather, <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> and the wetness of the soil. During a match, the player uses information on the heads-up display to determine such factors as <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> and direction, the ball's distance from the flag and the height difference between the ball and the hole.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{direction}} is usually {{expressed in terms}} of the direction from which it originates. For example, a northerly wind blows from the north to the south. Weather vanes pivot to indicate the direction of the wind. At airports, windsocks indicate wind direction, and {{can also be used to}} estimate <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> by the angle of hang. <b>Wind</b> <b>speed</b> is measured by anemometers, most commonly using rotating cups or propellers. When a high measurement frequency is needed (such as in research applications), wind can be measured by the propagation speed of ultrasound signals or by the effect of ventilation on the resistance of a heated wire. Another type of anemometer uses pitot tubes that take advantage of the pressure differential between an inner tube and an outer tube that is exposed to the wind to determine the dynamic pressure, which is then used to compute the <b>wind</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E
500|$|A {{tropical}} depression {{is the lowest}} category that the Japan Meteorological Agency uses and is the term used for a tropical system that has <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> not exceeding [...] A {{tropical depression}} is upgraded to a tropical storm should its sustained <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> exceed [...] Tropical storms also receive official names from RSMC Tokyo.

30|$|The {{algorithm}} in {{the previous}} section is now applied to the <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> at site 1. At this site, we have h_ 0 = 0, i.e. there are no <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> with 0 m/s.|$|R
30|$|Δ v_i^forecast (t) is {{the spatial}} {{dispersion}} of the forecasted <b>wind</b> <b>speeds,</b> and ε_i^forecast (t) is the forecasting errors of <b>wind</b> <b>speeds.</b> They are completely different, and therefore no systematic cancellation will be resulted in.|$|R
5|$|With {{regard to}} hurricanes, it was {{hypothesized}} that by seeding the area around the eyewall with silver iodide, latent heat would be released. This would promote the formation of a new eyewall. As this new eyewall was larger than the old eyewall, the winds of the tropical cyclone would be weaker due to a reduced pressure gradient. Even a small reduction in the speed of a hurricane's winds would be beneficial: since the damage potential of a hurricane increased as the square of the <b>wind</b> <b>speed,</b> a slight lowering of <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> would have a large reduction in destructiveness.|$|E
5|$|Images {{from the}} Akatsuki orbiter {{revealed}} {{something similar to}} jet stream winds in the low and middle cloud region, which extends from 45 to 60 kilometers in altitude. The <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> maximized near the equator. In September 2017 JAXA scientists named this phenomenon 'Venusian equatorial jet'.|$|E
5|$|Station model plots use {{a mixture}} of metric and Imperial units {{depending}} on the map's location and what is being shown. Surface maps in the United States primarily use Imperial units, such as inches, degrees Fahrenheit, and knots. Most of the world, however, uses metric measurements for everything but <b>wind</b> <b>speed,</b> which is shown in knots.|$|E
50|$|A {{tropical}} depression {{is the lowest}} category that the Japan Meteorological Agency uses and is the term used for a tropical system that has <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> not exceeding 33 kn. A {{tropical depression}} is upgraded to a tropical storm should its sustained <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> exceed 34 kn. Tropical storms also receive official names from RSMC Tokyo. Should the storm intensify further and reach sustained <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> of 48 kn {{then it will be}} classified as a severe tropical storm. Once the system's maximum sustained <b>winds</b> reach <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> of 64 kn, the JMA will designate the tropical cyclone as a typhoon—the highest category on its scale.|$|R
50|$|The <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> {{encountered}} in Germany from the Niklas storm were {{comparable to the}} strongest <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> (in both the peak gusts and in the highest 10-minute average <b>wind</b> <b>speeds)</b> recorded during March over the 1981-2010 reference period. The Niklas storm is thus {{one of the most}} violent storms {{encountered in}} Germany during March. which is particularly noteworthy as the storm occurred so late in March and after the beginning of meteorological spring.|$|R
5000|$|Prevailing {{winds are}} from the west. Average <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> [...] "blowing off the prairie" [...] are greater in the Chicago area. Statewide, the <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> average 8 to 12 mph, and is greater in the winter than in summer.|$|R
5|$|The {{magnitude}} of winds offshore are {{nearly double the}} <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> observed onshore. This is attributed to the differences in friction between land masses and offshore waters. Sometimes, there are even directional differences, particularly if local sea breezes change the wind on shore during daylight hours.|$|E
5|$|Throughout its existence, Christine was {{monitored}} by astronauts in the Skylab 3 project. During this project, active and passive microwave satellite imagery {{was used for}} the first time to determine the <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> within a tropical cyclone. This was accomplished after the removal of regions of heavy rain from the data, a factor that gives inaccurate wind readings.|$|E
5|$|Typically, {{if there}} is little wind shear, the storm will rapidly enter the dissipating stage and 'rain itself out', but, {{if there is}} {{sufficient}} change in <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> and/or direction, the downdraft will {{be separated from the}} updraft, and the storm may become a supercell, where the mature stage can sustain itself for several hours.|$|E

25|$|Project Loon is Google's pursuit {{to deploy}} a high-altitude balloon network {{operating}} in the stratosphere, at altitudes between 18km and 25km. Google asserts that this particular layer of the stratosphere is advantageous because of its relatively low <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> (e.g., <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> between 5 and 20mph / 10 to 30 km/h) and minimal turbulence. Moreover, Google claims that it can model, with reasonable accuracy, the seasonal, longitudinal, and latitudinal variations in <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> within the 18–25km stratospheric layer.|$|R
5|$|Wind {{power in}} an open air stream is thus {{proportional}} to the third power of the wind speed; the available power increases eightfold when the <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> doubles. Wind turbines for grid electric power therefore need to be especially efficient at greater wind speeds.|$|E
5|$|Alex was {{the first}} Atlantic {{hurricane}} {{in the month of}} June since Hurricane Allison in 1995, and the strongest in terms of <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> since Hurricane Alma in 1966. Its barometric pressure recording of 946 mbar (27.96inches) is the most intense from any Atlantic hurricane in June, although Hurricane Audrey in 1957 ties this intensity. Alex is thus tied for the most intense June Atlantic hurricane on record overall. However, as Audrey's pressure was estimated, Audrey's actual pressure might be as low as 925 mbar.|$|E
5|$|Any {{tropical}} cyclone that develops within the Southern Hemisphere between Africa and 90°E is monitored by Meteo France's La Reunion {{tropical cyclone}} centre (MFR, RSMC La Reunion). Within the region a tropical disturbance is defined to be a non-frontal synoptic scale low pressure area, originating over tropical or sub-tropical waters with organized convection and definite cyclonic surface wind circulation {{with the average}} <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> estimated to be not exceeding 27 knots (50km/h)).|$|E
40|$|Wind tunnel {{tests were}} {{conducted}} to study the characteristics of particle motion and the quantity transported by wind {{under a variety of}} planetary environmental conditions. Analysis of the results indicates that, on Earth, saltation fully develops at near-threshold <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> and rarely chokes (retarding of saltation due to high particle concentration and subsequent increase of mid-air collisions). On Mars, saltation becomes fully developed only at favorable locations and at <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> well above threshold. The Martian saltation cloud has an insufficient particle concentration to cause choking, particularly over a partially rocky surface. On Venus, full saltation occurs at <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> very near threshold, but saltation flux increases less rapidly than expected at relatively modest <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> due to choking...|$|R

5|$|For a given {{topography}} and bathymetry {{the surge}} height is not solely affected by peak wind speed; {{the size of}} the storm also affects the peak surge. With any storm, the area of piled up water can flow out of the storm perimeter, and this escape mechanism is reduced in proportion to the surge force (for the same peak <b>wind</b> <b>speed)</b> when the storm covers more area (storm perimeter length per area is inversely proportional to a circular storm's diameter).|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the national meteorological services of each nation, the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center monitors the basin, and issues warnings on significant tropical cyclones for the United States Government. These warnings use a 1-minute sustained <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> and {{can be compared to}} the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, however, the JTWC uses their own scale for intensity classifications in this basin. These classifications are Tropical Depression, Tropical Storm, Typhoon and Super Typhoon. In addition, the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau has its own scale in Chinese but uses the Typhoon Committee scale in English.|$|E
5|$|In meteorology, station {{models are}} {{symbolic}} illustrations showing the weather occurring {{at a given}} reporting station. Meteorologists created the station model to fit a number of weather elements into a small space on weather maps.
