As a glide ended, the pilot was supposed to lower himself to a vertical position through {{an opening in the}} wing and land on his feet <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> wrapped over the framework. Within a few glides, however, they discovered the pilot could remain prone on the wing, headfirst, without undue danger when landing. They made all their flights in that position for the next five years.|$|E

Claire's contractions begin to stop. Claire and Charlie are then met by Ethan, who looks at them ominously.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} career, after scoring a goal, Del Piero often celebrated by {{running to the}} touchline {{in front of the}} fans <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> out-stretched, and {{sticking}} out his tongue, in a similar manner to Michael Jordan, also frequently leaping into the air with a raised fist towards the sky, or sliding onto his knees whilst passionately chanting to the crowd. Del Piero also performed a back-flip goal celebration in a 2008 UEFA Champions League match against Zenit, and he also pointed up at the sky after scoring on certain occasions, to dedicate a goal to his late father, such as when he scored against Bari during the 2000–01 season, and Mexico at the 2002 World Cup.|$|E

5|$|The {{limestone}} {{sculpture of}} Seneb {{and his family}} {{is part of the}} collection of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. It depicts Seneb and his wife sitting next to each other with their children in the lower register. Seneb is depicted sitting cross-legged on a block of stone <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> folded in a position characteristic of a scribe. His wife Senet sits alongside him, wearing a long robe with long sleeves and a wig covering her natural hair, which can be glimpsed on her forehead. She encircles him with her arms in a gesture of affection and support. She is shown with a slight smile on her face to signify her contentment and happiness.|$|E
5|$|According to the Malayalam Bhagavata Purana, Krishna got {{the name}} Keshava as he slew Keshi. Krishna is {{referred}} to as slayer of Keshi twice in the Bhagavata Gita by Arjuna - Keshava (1.30) and Keshi-nisudana (18.1). In the first chapter (1.30), addressing Krishna as slayer of Keshi, Arjuna expresses his doubts about war, at the same time, finds Krishna capable of destroying them. Here, Keshi represents false pride and the reference as slayer of Keshi by Arjuna expresses his humility. Keshi as a mad horse who created havoc in Gokula - also represents the wild horse of doubts who run in the mind of a person. In the last chapter (18.1), Arjuna addresses Krishna as Maha-baho ("mighty-armed") paired with the slayer of Keshi epithet, reminding the reader how Krishna killed Keshi <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> alone. The Vishnu sahasranama ("The Thousand names of Vishnu") calls Krishna as Keshava (Names 23, 648) and Keshitha (649) - the slayer of Keshi. The fourth century play Mudrarakshasa also interprets the epithet Keshava as the slayer of Keshi. Keshighat is a major bathing ghat along the river Yamuna in Vrindavan, where Krishna is believed to have overpowered Keshi.|$|E

25|$|In early 1812, a seaman named Oakey struck Collier. The {{subsequent}} {{court martial}} {{sentenced him to}} death. His plea for a stay of execution was denied, and every ship in port sent a boat of seamen to witness the hanging.

However, after the sentence of the Court Martial had been read Captain Hall produced {{a letter from the}} Prince Regent that, at Collier's request, commuted Oakey's sentence to transportation.

25|$|Not once, {{but three}} times, the stumps were plucked by players eager to grab souvenirs of an {{historic}} occasion.

He celebrated his climb by standing <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> outspread on the pinnacle of one of the Twin Towers.

25|$|On April 12, 2008, Margarito {{engaged in}} a rematch with Cintron, who had won the IBF Welterweight title belt {{following}} his loss to Margarito in 2005. In the early rounds, Cintron struck Margarito with several flush power shots to the head, but Margarito remained unhurt and continued to execute a game plan of continuously moving forward and pressuring Cintron. In the sixth round, Margarito landed a liver shot, knocking Cintron out and taking the IBF title. As the referee counted Cintron out, HBO cameras captured Margarito from a neutral corner, gesturing upward <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> and urging Cintron to get up so {{that the two men}} could continue fighting.|$|E
