On the program, he discussed his 24-year career as the host of Jeopardy!. Another appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! was in 2011, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> the IBM Challenge on Jeopardy!.|$|E
25|$|The word satyagraha {{itself was}} coined through a public contest that Gandhi {{sponsored}} through the newspaper he published in South Africa, 'Indian Opinion', {{when he realized}} that neither the common, contemporary Hindu language nor the English language contained a word which fully expressed his own meanings and intentions <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> his nonviolent approaches to conflict. According to Gandhi's autobiography, the contest winner was Maganlal Gandhi (presumably no relation), who submitted the entry 'sadagraha', which Gandhi then modified to 'satyagraha'. Etymologically, this Hindic word means 'truth-firmness', and is commonly translated as 'steadfastness in the truth' or 'truth-force'.|$|E
25|$|Heidegger {{theorized that}} Dasein exists {{as an agent}} who is always-already engaged in a world with other human beings. Charles Taylor built on Heidegger's work <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> engaged agency, or the idea that Dasein is an agent inescapably engaged in his world. What Heidegger, and later Taylor, {{are saying is that}} that world is {{constantly}} “there-for-us” to experience prior to any abstract, disengaged scientific theorizing, and this is where hermeneutics starts to deviate from mainstream psychological and personality theories. In other words, Dasein (a person) does not need to scientifically analyze human interaction to take part in it. All he needs to do is observe human interaction, interpret what those observations mean for him, and then participate accordingly. Heidegger termed this description as being-in-the-world, i.e. human beings exist in the world as active participants who are so deeply immersed that their world around them becomes utterly inescapable, especially when trying to understand themselves.|$|E

25|$|James Mensch {{provided}} {{an understanding of}} imagining the experiences of others (what can also be called empathic envisioning) and what that might look like <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> literary imagination humans: the capacity of humans to imagine the experiences of characters in novels. Mensch explained that human beings' embodiment provides them with the capacity to imagine these experiences and then relate to them through empathy. For Mensch, people are only capable of having experiences because of and through their body. Humans (Dasein) experience life, others, the world, etc. via their bodies which can taste, smell, hear, feel, and see. More to the point, their bodies encapsulate our various mental faculties required for processing and retaining those experiences. This means human experiences are experiences of the body. Relating to others then is when two bodies experience one another: they inter-relate. Because humans (Dasein) hold their bodily experiences in their memory, {{they are able to}} use our literary imagination to envision the experiences of characters in novels.|$|E
500|$|In another {{interview}} he added, [...] "It was exciting {{to work for}} him [...] because he was so interesting <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> a scene or talked about people. One would just want to hear him talk, because things he would say, you'd never heard before... He had such a great understanding... he loved actors so much." ...|$|E
500|$|Many years later, {{another of}} his followers, Virginia Downsborough, {{recalled}} that during the mid-1960s he [...] "talked a lot about Sara Northrup and {{seemed to want to}} make sure that I knew he had never married her. I didn't know why it was so important to him; I'd never met Sara and I couldn't have cared less, but he wanted to persuade me that the marriage had never taken place. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> his first wife, the picture he put out of himself was of this poor wounded fellow coming home from the war and being abandoned by his wife and family because he would be a drain on them." [...] As Downsborough put it, he portrayed himself as [...] "a constant victim of women".|$|E

500|$|Other {{critics of}} the {{movement}} assail promises made by its leaders, arguing that the broad freedom from problems they promise is irresponsible. Televangelists are often criticized for abusing the faith of their listeners by enriching themselves through large donations. Prosperity theology has been opposed for not adequately explaining the poverty of the Apostles. For instance, some theologians believe that the life and writings of Paul the Apostle, who {{is believed to have}} experienced significant suffering during his ministry, are particularly in conflict with prosperity theology. [...] Cathleen Falsani, religion writer in an opinion piece in the Washington Post, points to the conflict with basic Christian teachings [...] "Jesus was born poor, and he died poor. During his earthly tenure, he spoke time and again about the importance of spiritual wealth and health. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> material wealth, it was usually part of a cautionary tale." ...|$|E
2500|$|Billy Corgan of The Smashing Pumpkins {{selected}} [...] "Arabian Knights" [...] <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> {{some of his}} favourite {{music on}} BBC radio: commenting the song, he said that [...] "Siouxsie and the Banshees were able to unlock certain rhythms and feelings that are still in alt rock today".|$|E
2500|$|In 1975, Kundera {{moved to}} France. There he {{published}} The Book of Laughter and Forgetting (1979) which told of Czech citizens opposing {{the communist regime}} in various ways. An unusual mixture of novel, short story collection and author's musings, the book {{set the tone for}} his works in exile. Critics have noted the irony that the country that Kundera seemed to be writing about <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> Czechoslovakia in the book, [...] "is, thanks to the latest political redefinitions, no longer precisely there" [...] which is the [...] "kind of disappearance and reappearance" [...] Kundera explores in the book. Published in Czech (Kniha smíchu a zapomnění) in April 1981 by 68 Publishers Toronto.|$|E

2500|$|CNN pundit David Gergen {{argued that}} while, in his view, Obama has wrongly apologized for American actions before, {{he did not}} do so here and {{conservative}} criticisms are unfounded. Independent Senator Joseph Lieberman lauded the speech and went on to remark, [...] "Obama is off to a very, very good start in a very difficult time in our nation's history." [...] A spokesman for Human Rights Watch stated that [...] "there were many things that were commendable ... but it is disappointing that <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> democracy in the Muslim world he wasn't more specific about some of the problems." [...] He also stated that Obama refrained from talking about what the spokesman saw as the suppression of dissidents in Egypt.|$|E
2500|$|On October 20, {{while on}} a trip to Beijing, Duterte {{declared}} a [...] "separation" [...] from the United States which he stated had lost militarily, socially, and economically, and emphasized a realignment of the Philippines to move closer to China. During a press conference after arriving from Beijing, Duterte clarified that what he meant by [...] "separation" [...] was a [...] "separation of a foreign policy" [...] and not a severance of diplomatic ties, saying {{that it would not be}} feasible to cut diplomatic ties with the U.S. due to the large number of Filipino Americans. U.S. Department of State spokesperson John Kirby responded by saying: [...] "We are going to be seeking an explanation of exactly what the president meant <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> separation from the U.S.; it's not clear what that means and all its ramifications." [...] On October 23, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel R. Russel traveled to Manila to seek clarification and explanation for Duterte's comments with Philippine officials, including Foreign Affairs Secretary Perfecto Yasay Jr. and Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana.|$|E
2500|$|... "Portmanteaux {{first came}} about with Lewis Carroll" [...] {{as a way}} to blend words, stated Jonathan Gabay, author of the Copywriter's Compendium—a {{reference}} guide to the English language. Gabay added that people blend words in this fashion because sometimes there are words an individual wants, but those words do not actually exist. [...] "There's a feeling you are trying to get out", he said. For fictional pairings, examples showcase themselves as Logan and Veronica (Veronica Mars) becomes [...] "LoVe", Josh and Reva (Guiding Light) becomes [...] "Jeva", Jack and Kate (Lost) becomes [...] "Jate", Michael and Sara (Prison Break) becomes [...] "MiSa", and so on. Some couples are given more complex portmanteaux; on (How I Met Your Mother), the pairing of Barney and Robin is referred to as [...] "BROTP", incorporating their initials, their platonic status as [...] "bros", and the popular fandom term OTP ("One True Pairing"). Seth Cohen of the show The O.C. parodied name-blending trends <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> real couples' overexposure to one another; he wondered whether or not his pairing with Summer Roberts would be called [...] "Summereth" [...] or [...] "Sethummer".|$|E

60|$|Deering {{admitted}} that he did not, but <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> Neilson he used some caution. Since Jimmy trusted Stannard, there was no use in trying to warn him; some time he would get enlightenment.|$|E
