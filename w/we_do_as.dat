25|$|When we {{talk about}} a {{permanent}} vegetative state, I am offended by that. Terri smiles and acknowledges the people that love her {{when they come to}} see her. She cries when they leave. How heartless are we to call somebody like Terri Schiavo a vegetable? What are we thinking?When we think about this case, we need to think about the message that we are sending to our children and our grandchildren. What we do in this Chamber tonight is as important as anything we have done in defending our Nation, in doing the things that <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>as</b> Members of Congress.|$|E
500|$|While {{writing the}} book, Gladwell noted that [...] "the biggest {{misconception}} about success {{is that we}} do it solely on our smarts, ambition, hustle and hard work." [...] In Outliers, he hopes to show {{that there are a lot}} more variables involved in an individual's success than society cares to admit, and he wants people to [...] "move away from the notion that everything that happens to a person is up to that person". Gladwell noted that, although there was little that could be done with regard to a person's fate, society can still impact the [...] "man"-affected part of an individual's success. When asked what message he wanted people to take away after reading Outliers, Gladwell responded, [...] "What <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>as</b> a community, as a society, for each other, matters as much as what we do for ourselves. It sounds a little trite, but there's a powerful amount of truth in that, I think." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, Blyss re-recorded, remixed, and {{released}} {{twelve of the}} fifteen Diff's Lucky Day session demos as No Name Face, their debut major label release {{under the name of}} Lifehouse. On their choosing the band name, frontman Jason Wade said, [...] "It's about what <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>as</b> a band and for me personally. Most of this record is about my life and about life's circumstances. Not only my life, but other peoples' lives. We thought Lifehouse was a good name for it." ...|$|E

60|$|Well, <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>as</b> he suggested, and no lad on the {{frontier}} could have done better work than this same Paul, who was so lately come from the east.|$|R
60|$|Some of {{the party}} grow old and infirm; others thought {{of the absence of}} the hostess, whose {{reception}} of her guests was always kind. <b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>we</b> could, however.|$|R
2500|$|It {{should be}} noted that the Sabbateans based their teachings on the same Zohar and Lurianic kabbalah that are {{considered}} part of classical Judaism by Hasidism. Where the Sabbateans diverged from accepted teaching was in believing that Sabbatai Zevi was [...] "the Messiah" [...] and that the Halakha (Jewish law) was no longer binding. Rebbe Nachman did not do the same. He did not claim he was the Messiah, and when asked, [...] "What do <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>as</b> Breslover Hasidim?" [...] he replied, [...] "Whatever it says in the Shulchan Aruch (Code of Jewish Law)." ...|$|E
2500|$|Parker {{is a part}} of {{the large}} and diverse Perth music scene, where he plays in various {{different}} bands in addition to his main project, Tame Impala. Commenting on this, Parker said [...] "it's a really close-knit scene, quiet, separated from the rest of Australia" [...] and [...] "Tame Impala is just one sliver of the giant amount of noise-making that <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>as</b> a circle of friends. I don't feel bad doing the recording by myself because I don't expect that input in their bands...to us Tame Impala is just Kevin Parker's project and everyone has a project." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed it is not," [...] {{returned}} Andy. [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>as</b> well as {{that every}} day we shall get along very well, although I trust to do even better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we {{have seen}} some very {{interesting}} things. I'll tell you what <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> walk. First of all, we saw the body of this unfortunate man. He certainly died from a revolver wound as reported." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I see {{no great}} scandal in talking right on to bedtime. And seeing Avebury to-morrow. Why not? Perhaps if <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>as</b> the Germans <b>do</b> and gave our names now, it might {{mitigate}} {{something of the}} extreme informality of our behaviour." ...|$|R
6000|$|What <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> climbed, {{and what}} we talked of [...] Matters not much, nor to what it led, - Something that life will not be balked of [...] Without rude reason till hope is dead, [...] And feeling fled.|$|R
6000|$|... 'All's over now,' {{said the}} vintner. 'Fifty {{thousand}} pounds will be scattered in a minute. We must save ourselves. We {{can do no}} more, and shall {{have reason to be}} thankful if <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>as</b> much.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is to {{be noted}} in {{connection}} with the argument," [...] I ventured to remark, [...] "that we hear but little concerning the wives of intellectual men. When <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> <b>as</b> {{in the case of the}} Carlyles, it is to wish we did not." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'You did {{not tell}} me,' she said, 'how many wives your men have.' 'That all depends upon the will of our sovereign,' I replied; 'in matrimonial affairs <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>as</b> we are commanded. When we have no {{commands}} from the throne, our circumstances regulate the matter.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Suffer the Children" [...] was {{the first}} song <b>we</b> <b>did</b> {{together}} when <b>we</b> left Graduate. It was our very first experimentation with sequencers and drum machines, with a guy called David Lord, who worked with Peter Gabrieland different people down in Bath. So that was actually the first song <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>as</b> Tears For Fears. Curt Smith ...|$|R
5000|$|Reflecting on the album, keyboardist Ted Ottaviano explained, [...] "I've always {{believed}} people's aesthetics are {{based more on}} what they don't know than what they do know,...We had great instincts, and wanted to say what <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>as</b> swiftly and simply as we could." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> were desired. The manager lighted the fuse, and {{followed}} us. In {{a few moments}} there occurred an explosion so violent that the huge boulder was shattered into several pieces, which were quite small enough to be lifted and carted away.|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>as</b> well right {{straight}} through," [...] he said, {{as he and}} Andy talked it over {{on their}} way to Lehighton and Mauch Chunk, [...] "we will have quite an amount to place to our credit in the bank by the time we reach New York again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As for {{the four}} men, you may safely set us down as eight. I'll engage <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>as</b> much in a blow, as eight such fellows as are picked up now-a-days 'long shore. The men of the present time are mere {{children}} to those one met with in my youth, Miles!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{take care}} of ourselves. All the sea is our home, and <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>as</b> we please. Come, come, and see how gay it is!" [...] called Silver-tail, the other mermaid, tossing bubbles like a juggler till the air was full of them as they sailed away on the wind.|$|E
6000|$|... "I did {{not think}} of it," [...] Malchus said, [...] "nor, I suppose, did the others. Halcon was our leader, and <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>as</b> he told us. He thought the fires would keep them off. Who could have thought the beasts would have ventured to attack us!" ...|$|R
50|$|As we {{remember}} {{the past and}} embrace the future, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> so <b>as</b> disciples in mission.|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>we</b> can <b>do</b> <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> before, those fellows {{will soon}} show their backs!" [...] Mark cried, cheerily, himself setting the example by {{wounding}} the officer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you've {{redeemed}} yourself," [...] Thompson said, as Frank {{walked to}} the tent. [...] "You played splendidly, old fellow, when you did come. If <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>as</b> well next innings we are safe. They're not likely to average eighty. Now get on your wicket-keeping gloves. Green and I will bowl." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; I {{will stay}} {{for a day or}} two to lull suspicion. They may watch us just at first, but if they see that <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>as</b> we are ordered with good-will they will cease to regard us so narrowly; moreover, it will be needful to know the place well before I devise a plan of escape." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nonsense, Denis; {{they eat}} beef and mutton {{just the same}} as <b>we</b> <b>do.</b> <b>As</b> to the frogs and snails, these are {{expensive}} luxuries, just as game is with us. There is nothing more nasty about snails after all than there is about oysters; and as to frogs they were regarded as great dainties by the Romans, who certainly knew what good eating was." ...|$|E
5000|$|We Get There When <b>We</b> <b>Do,</b> stylised <b>as</b> (<b>We</b> Get There When <b>We</b> <b>Do.),</b> is a 1995 {{album with}} [...] "timeless intrigue" [...] by Suddenly, Tammy! ...|$|R
60|$|This {{version of}} that strange affair, the {{slaughter}} of the Ruthvens, is taken entirely from the lips of sworn witnesses. We still know no more than <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>as</b> to what passed between the moment when James and the Master, alone, left the dining chamber, and {{the moment when the}} King cried ‘Treason!’ out of the turret window.|$|R
50|$|What <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>as</b> {{part of the}} war {{was soon}} {{forgotten}} by the nation in general and the war earned the title: The Forgotten War. To those of us who went through the hail of enemy AAA fire, it was never forgotten. Eight of us started out on this adventure; six of us came home alive after flying an average of 150 missions.|$|R
60|$|As social units, as civilized men {{we have to}} do what <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>as</b> {{physical}} organisms. Every day, the {{sun sets}} from the sky, and darkness falls, and every day, when this happens, the tide of life turns in us. Instead of flowing upwards and outwards towards mental consciousness and activity, it turns back, to flow downwards. Downwards towards the digestion processes, downwards further to the great sexual conjunctions, downwards to sleep.|$|E
60|$|This {{criticism}} {{refers to}} the case, the habit, of the book rather than to its spirit, since when we write <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> <b>as</b> the red man thought, impart something of our souls to the paper, and {{it is probable that}} if I were to write a new dream of the future it would, though in some respects very different from this, still be a dream and picture of the human race in its forest period.|$|E
6000|$|... "She cannot call us {{back before}} to-morrow night in case only one {{stays on the}} {{plantation}} now," [...] Pierre said, [...] "and by that time we will {{have been able to}} get a look around the town--mayhap be so fortunate as to see some way by which we can work our will. At all events, it seems best that <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>as</b> I have said, although I am willing to fall in with whatsoever other plan you lads may propose." ...|$|E
5000|$|Guitarist Stone Gossard on the song:"Breath" [...] is on {{the first}} demo <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>as</b> a band. I used a Les Paul and Marshall on that track. We didn't really have time to mess around and bring in my Vox AC30 and my Steinberger! We had a day-and-a-half to do it, so I just played through my normal set up.|$|R
6000|$|... "De Chargny and his {{men will}} be such as are worth going far to meet, for he will have the pick of France under his banner that night. If <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>as</b> this man says and awaited him with {{the same number of}} lances, then I cannot think that there is any spot in Christendom where one would rather be than in Calais that night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{know how}} to handle one. Phil has been {{painting}} a big door to represent a black bear, {{and we are going to}} see if <b>we</b> can <b>do</b> <b>as</b> well with a revolver <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> with the rifle." ...|$|R
