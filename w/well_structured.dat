In Canada, energy development continues to fragment and disturb prairie habitat, but effects {{of oil and}} gas development on reproductive success of songbirds in North American mixed-grass prairies remains largely unknown. From 2010 - 2012, in southeastern Alberta, Canada, we monitored 257 nests of two ground-nesting grassland songbird species, Savannah sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis) and chestnut-collared longspur (Calcarius ornatus). Nest locations varied with proximity to and density of conventional shallow gas <b>well</b> <b>structures</b> and associated roads in forty-two 258 -ha mixed-grass prairie sites. We estimated the probabilities of nest success and clutch size relative to gas <b>well</b> <b>structures</b> and roads.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{study of}} the polarization independent quantum-well gain using interdiffusion is presented here. Group V sublattice interdiffusion in InGaAs/InP quantum wells is used to produce polarization independent optical gain. The reverse bias and carrier effects on the subband structures, transition energy and optical gain of the interdiffused quantum well are discussed. The interdiffused quantum <b>well</b> <b>structures</b> are optimized {{in terms of their}} subband structure, carrier density, structural parameters and properties of optical gain spectra. The results show that an optimized interdiffused quantum <b>well</b> <b>structure</b> can produce polarization independent optical gain over a range of operation wavelengths around 1. 5 μm, although the differential gain and linewidth enhancement factor are slightly degraded. The required tensile strain for the polarization independence of a lattice-matched quantum <b>well</b> <b>structure</b> is generated here using interdiffusion.

[...] Mountain air tends to be thin, cold and dry, yet solar radiation is stronger, passing through both warming radiation and intense ultraviolet light. [...] Due {{to the fact that}} mountain air cannot hold heat well, grapevines experience dramatic daily air temperature fluctuations. [...] Studies of altitude vineyards by CENAVIT and other organizations suggest that fruit subject to these conditions tends to produce greater concentrations of monoterpene aromatics held in a free state rather than sequestered as oils.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{theoretical}} and experimental {{investigation of the}} intersubband transitions in quantum <b>well</b> <b>structures.</b> The I-V characteristics, infrared absorption spectra, and photoresponse spectra of superlattices are used to characterize multiple quantum <b>well</b> <b>structure</b> properties in unipolar devices. An important numerical method for solving the problem of bound-to-continuum transitions, the transfer matrix method, is presented for the self-consistent calculations. Although the boundary conditions are relaxed due to the calculation self-consistentcy, inappropriate boundary conditions were previously included in the literature. The first observation of the quantum interference effect in the photocurrent spectra is described using a weakly coupled bound-to-continuum transition quantum <b>well</b> <b>structure</b> and electric field domain formation in the device. This effect persists even at high biases where Kronig-Penny minibands of periodic superlattice potential in the continuum are destroyed. Using this observation, the electric field domain formation and the electron coherence length in superlattices were analyzed. A large off-resonant energy level alignment between two neighboring wells in the high field domain was observed. The effect of temperature on the transport properties was also discussed. As a further study of electric field domain formation in superlattices, an optical experiment using Stark effect is suggested. The dependence of the absorption spectral linewidth of quantum well intersubband transitions on the electron population in the well is experimentally demonstrated using field-induced charge transfer and thermal-induced charge transfer in an asymmetric coupled quantum <b>well</b> <b>structure.</b> We show that this population-induced broadening {{is very important in}} the broadening of intersubband transitions in quantum <b>well</b> <b>structures</b> and that previously reported linewidth values for the contribution from donor scattering were overestimated.
