5|$|The Basin gates contain many sluices, so {{water can}} be quickly drained out or let in {{according}} to whether the sea level is above or below the prevailing docks water level but more water is lost from No.1 dock supply if the Basin water is lowered to the seaward side of the lock gates instead of using the Lady Windsor lock sluices. In the early days, the dock operators would often run the <b>water</b> <b>down</b> {{to bring in a}} single ship having a wider beam than the Lady Windsor lock could handle.|$|E
5|$|When the lophophore is extended, cilia (little hairs) on {{the sides}} of the tentacles draw <b>water</b> <b>down</b> between the tentacles and out at the base of the lophophore. Shorter cilia on the inner sides of the tentacles flick food {{particles}} into a groove in a circle under and just inside the tentacles, and cilia in the groove push the particles into the mouth. Phoronids direct their lophophores into the water current, and quickly reorient to maximize the food-catching area when currents change. Their diet includes algae, diatoms, flagellates, peridinians, small invertebrate larvae, and detritus. Unwanted material can be excluded by closing the epistome (lid above the mouth) or be rejected by the tentacles, whose cilia can switch into reverse. The gut uses cilia and muscles to move food towards the stomach and secretes enzymes that digest some of the food, but the stomach digests the majority of the food. Phoronids also absorb amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) through their skins, mainly in summer. Solid wastes are moved up the intestine and out through the anus, which is outside and slightly below the lophophore.|$|E

25|$|The Babcock {{test was}} the first {{inexpensive}} and practical test which {{were used to determine}} the fat content of milk. Invented by Stephen Moulton Babcock in 1890, the test was developed to prevent dishonest farmers who could, until the 1890s, <b>water</b> <b>down</b> their milk or remove some cream before selling it to the factories because milk was paid by volume.|$|E
25|$|Ancient Minoan {{private homes}} had running water. A bathtub {{virtually}} identical to modern ones was unearthed at the Palace of Knossos. Several Minoan private homes also had toilets, {{which could be}} flushed by pouring <b>water</b> <b>down</b> the drain. The ancient Romans had many public flush toilets, which emptied into an extensive sewage system.

Indeed, the estimated financial impact of Measure 50 was a $361 million reduction, rather than Measure 47's intended $458 million reduction.|$|E
25|$|Previously, it {{was unknown}} how {{pufferfish}} inflation took place. Recently, however, Dr. Peter Wainwright completed his {{analysis on the}} series of muscle actions which allow a pufferfish to inflate. First, the pufferfish fills its mouth with water. Then, it seals its mouth using a special valve {{at the bottom of}} the mouth. This valve flaps upward and covers the entire mouth of the fish. Next, a branchiostegal ray (a modified gill arch) pushes the <b>water</b> <b>down</b> the esophagus into the stomach. The extremely elastic stomach then expands. Depending on the species the fugu can achieve an almost perfect spherical shape.|$|E
25|$|Four major rivers {{drain the}} {{numerous}} mountains of the Dominican Republic. The Yaque del Norte {{is the longest}} and most important Dominican river. It carries excess <b>water</b> <b>down</b> from the Cibao Valley and empties into Monte Cristi Bay, in the northwest. Likewise, the Yuna River serves the Vega Real and empties into Samaná Bay, in the northeast. Drainage of the San Juan Valley {{is provided by the}} San Juan River, tributary of the Yaque del Sur, which empties into the Caribbean, in the south. The Artibonito is the longest river of Hispaniola and flows westward into Haiti.|$|E

25|$|The first {{recorded}} commercial vineyard was established at Santiago del Estero in 1557 by Jesuit missionaries which {{was followed by}} expansion of vineyard plantings in Mendoza in the early 1560s and San Juan between 1569 and 1589. During this time the missionaries and settlers in the area began construction of complex irrigation channels and dams that would bring <b>water</b> <b>down</b> from the melting glaciers of the Andes to sustain vineyards and agriculture. A provincial governor, Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, instructed the French agronomist Miguel Aimé Pouget to bring grapevine cuttings from France to Argentina. Of the vines that Pouget brought were the very first Malbec vines to be planted in that country.|$|E
25|$|In 1934, Norsk Hydro {{built the}} first {{commercial}} heavy water plant at Vemork, Tinn, with a capacity of 12 tonnes per year. From 1940 and throughout World War II, the plant was under German control and the Allies decided to destroy the plant and its heavy water to inhibit German development of nuclear weapons. In late 1942, a planned raid by British airborne troops failed, both gliders crashing. The raiders {{were killed in the}} crash or subsequently executed by the Germans. On the night of 27 February 1943 Operation Gunnerside succeeded. Norwegian commandos and local resistance managed to demolish small, but key parts of the electrolytic cells, dumping the accumulated heavy <b>water</b> <b>down</b> the factory drains.|$|E
25|$|Parrotts were {{manufactured}} with {{a combination}} of cast and wrought iron. The cast iron made for an accurate gun, but was brittle enough to suffer fractures. Hence, a large wrought iron reinforcing band was overlaid on the breech to give it additional strength. There were prior cannons designed this way, but the method of securing this band was the innovation that allowed the Parrott to overcome the deficiencies of these earlier models. It was applied to the gun red-hot and then the gun was turned while pouring <b>water</b> <b>down</b> the muzzle, allowing the band to attach uniformly. By the end of the Civil War, both sides were using this type of gun extensively.|$|E

25|$|Each hole {{has its own}} name, {{and some}} holes are named after famous courses or golf holes. The {{signature}} hole is the fifth hole (named Oak Tree), a 592-yard par five where players must avoid the oak tree that {{is used in the}} club's logo. Other notable holes include the eighth hole (named Harbor Town after Dye's Harbour Town Golf Links), par three with <b>water</b> <b>down</b> the entire left side. The tenth hole (named after the Prairie Dunes Country Club) is a long, tight par four. The 13th hole is named due to its size, after a postage stamp. Golfers liken landing a ball on the green to landing a ball on a space the size of a postage stamp.|$|E
25|$|Duchamp {{participated in}} the design of the 1938 International Surrealist Exhibition, which was held at the Galerie des Beaux-arts, Paris. The show {{featured}} more than 60 artists from different countries, including approximately 300 paintings, objects, collages, photographs, and installations. The surrealists wanted to create an exhibition which in itself would be a creative act, and André Breton named Duchamp, Wolfgang Paalen, Man Ray, Salvador Dali, and Max Ernst to help him. At the exhibition's entrance he placed Salvador Dalí's Rainy Taxi, a work consisting of a taxicab rigged to produce a drizzle of <b>water</b> <b>down</b> the inside of its windows, with a shark-headed creature in the driver's seat, and a blond mannequin covered with live snails in the back. In this way Duchamp confronted guests entering the exhibition, who were in full evening dress.|$|E
25|$|The NGO Human Rights First {{claimed that}} over 90% {{of the light}} weapons {{currently}} being imported by Sudan and used in the conflict are from China. Human rights advocates and opponents of the Sudanese government portray China's role in providing weapons and aircraft as a cynical attempt to obtain oil, just as colonial powers once supplied African chieftains with the military means to maintain control as they extracted natural resources. According to China's critics, China threatened to use its veto on the U.N. Security Council to protect Khartoum from sanctions {{and was able to}} <b>water</b> <b>down</b> every resolution on Darfur in order to protect its interests. Accusations of the supply of weapons from China, which were then transferred to Darfur by the Sudanese government in violation of the UN arms embargo, continued in 2010.|$|E

25|$|Spurred by {{a burgeoning}} {{interest}} in the assumed untapped product demand in Cuba, {{a growing number of}} free-marketers in Congress, backed by Western and Great Plains lawmakers who represent agribusiness, have tried each year since 2000 to <b>water</b> <b>down</b> or lift regulations preventing Americans from traveling to Cuba. Four times over that time period the United States House of Representatives has adopted language lifting the travel ban, and in 2003 the U.S. Senate followed suit for the first time. Each time President George W. Bush threatened to veto the bill. Faced with a veto threat, each year Congress dropped its attempt to lift the travel ban before sending legislation to the president. Some United States nationals circumvent the ban by traveling to Cuba from a different country (such as Mexico, The Bahamas, Canada or Costa Rica), as Cuban immigration authorities do not routinely stamp passports, but instead stamp a Cuban visa page which is provided, and not permanently affixed to the passport. In doing so, however, U.S. citizens still risk prosecution and fines by the U.S. government if discovered. Until July 20, 2015 there was no U.S. Embassy or consulate in Cuba and United States representation was limited to a United States Interests Section.|$|E
