5|$|Larger rodents tend to live {{in family}} units <b>where</b> <b>parents</b> and their {{offspring}} live together until the young disperse. Beavers live in extended family units typically {{with a pair of}} adults, this year's kits, the previous year's offspring, and sometimes older young. Brown rats usually live in small colonies with up to six females sharing a burrow and one male defending a territory around the burrow. At high population densities, this system breaks down and males show a hierarchical system of dominance with overlapping ranges. Female offspring remain in the colony while male young disperse. The prairie vole is monogamous and forms a lifelong pair bond. Outside the breeding season, prairie voles live in close proximity with others in small colonies. A male is not aggressive towards other males until he has mated, after which time he defends a territory, a female, and a nest against other males. The pair huddles together, grooms one another, and shares nesting and pup-raising responsibilities.|$|E

30|$|According to {{the study}} by Burgess, Hecht, and Lonigan (Burgess et al., 2002), there are {{different}} types of home literacy environment: (a) limiting home literacy environment, <b>where</b> the <b>parents</b> provide literacy opportunities to the children using resources that are at their disposal; (b) passive home literacy environment, <b>where</b> the <b>parents</b> provide a model to the children on literacy-related activities but do not involve themselves directly with the children for literacy activities; and (c) active home literacy environment, <b>where</b> the <b>parents</b> take efforts to directly engage in activities that help in literacy and language development in children.|$|R

25|$|All other {{approaches}} to homeschooling are subsumed under two basic categories: structured and unstructured homeschooling. Structured homeschooling includes any method or style of home education that follows a basic curriculum with articulated goals and outcomes. This style attempts {{to imitate the}} structure of the traditional school setting while personalizing the curriculum. Unstructured homeschooling is any form of home education <b>where</b> <b>parents</b> do not construct a curriculum at all. Unschooling, as it is known, attempts to teach through the child's daily experiences and focuses more on self-directed learning by the child, free of textbooks, teachers, and any formal assessment of success or failure.|$|E
25|$|In many {{immigrant}} families, {{members of}} the younger generation have greater English language proficiency than their elders. In families <b>where</b> <b>parents</b> may know little to no English, children may act as interpreters. Young children may therefore be involved in important family matters, including finances. In cases where children are in charge of paying bills, they may {{be in a position to}} take a portion of their parents' money for their own use. Even when this is not the case, the role of interpreter gives a particular family member a certain measure of control over other family members who are unable to communicate as well in English.|$|E

25|$|Bitterlings have a {{remarkable}} reproduction strategy <b>where</b> <b>parents</b> transfer {{responsibility for the}} care of their young to mussels. The female extends her ovipositor into the mantle cavity of the mussel and deposits her eggs between the gill filaments. The male then ejects his sperm into the mussel's inhalant water current and fertilization takes place within the gills of the host. The same female may use a number of mussels, and she deposits only one or two yellow, oval eggs into each. Early developmental stages are protected from predation within the body of the mussel. After 3 to 4 weeks larvae swim away from the host to continue life on their own.|$|E
25|$|Treatment of {{anorexia}} involves restoring {{a healthy}} weight, treating the underlying psychological problems, and addressing behaviors that promote the problem. While medications do not help with weight gain, {{they may be}} used to help with associated anxiety or depression. A number of types of therapy may be useful including an approach <b>where</b> <b>parents</b> assume responsibility for feeding their child, known as Maudsley family therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy. Sometimes people require admission to hospital to restore weight. Evidence for benefit from nasogastric tube feeding, however, is unclear. Some people will just have a single episode and recover while others may have many episodes over years. Many complications improve or resolve with regaining of weight.|$|E

30|$|According to Goldberg (1977), {{parenting}} {{confidence and}} competence are either strengthened or compromised {{depending on the}} results of parenting practices. In situations <b>where</b> <b>parenting</b> practices have predictable or desirable consequences, parenting confidence and competence are likely to be strengthened. This, in turn, is likely to positively influence the manner in which parents interact with their children. In contrast, in situations <b>where</b> <b>parenting</b> practices have unpredictable or undesirable consequences, parenting confidence and competence are likely to be compromised or attenuated. This, in turn, is likely to interfere with or negatively affect parent–child interactions. Mooney-Doyle et al. (2015), in a recent review of the parenting practices literature, found that efficacious parenting had positive effects on both child behavior and parents’ responses to displays of child competence. According to Nelson et al. (2014), these reciprocal effects help to explain the “psychological mechanisms…that mediate the relationship between parent[ing] and well-being” (pp. 846 – 847).|$|R
25|$|In {{examining}} {{game play}} habits at Internet cafés, South Korea {{has seen a}} rise in female gamers publicly playing games such as Lineage, while in other Asian countries this kind of public female gaming has remained rare; similarly, games such as Tamagotchi {{are seen as a}} gender neutral in Japan, but have been regarded as girls' games in the West. In other cases, female trends in one country may be indicators of associated changes in others, {{as in the case of}} a rising number of female Lineage players in Korea having led to increased number of female Lineage players in Taiwan. In Japan the rise of cute culture and its associated marketing has made gaming accessible for girls, and this trend has also carried over to Taiwan and recently China (both countries previously having focused mostly on MMOs and <b>where</b> <b>parents</b> usually place harsher restrictions on daughters than on sons).|$|E
25|$|American {{public school}} systems, {{especially}} in large metropolitan areas, {{to a large}} extent are still de facto segregated. Whether due to Brown, or due to Congressional action, or due to societal change, the percentage of black students attending majority-black school districts decreased somewhat until the early 1980s, at which point that percentage began to increase. By the late 1990s, the percentage of black students in mostly minority school districts had returned to about what it was in the late 1960s. In Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1 (2007), the Court held that, if a school system became racially imbalanced due to social factors other than governmental racism, then the state is not as free to integrate schools as if the state had been at fault for the racial imbalance. This is especially evident in the charter school system <b>where</b> <b>parents</b> of students can pick which schools their children attend based on the amenities provided by that school and the needs of the child. It seems that race is a factor in the choice of charter school.|$|E
25|$|Public K-12 {{education}} in Wenatchee {{is provided by}} the Wenatchee School District#246, which also serves the communities of Malaga, Olds Station, South Wenatchee, Sunnyslope, and Wenatchee Heights. The city is served by seven elementary schools which provide education from kindergarten through Grade 5. Columbia, Lewis and Clark, Lincoln, Mission View, Newbery and Washington Elementary schools provide instruction within, or near, the city limits of Wenatchee, whilst Sunnyslope Elementary provides instruction in the orchard and suburban hills of Sunnyslope, north of Wenatchee. Students then progress to one of the city's three middle schools, Foothills, Orchard, or Pioneer Middle Schools, which provide Grade 6 through Grade 8 instruction within the City Limits. All Wenatchee middle schools transfer their graduating student body up to Wenatchee High School, which operates Grade 9 through Grade 12, with the option for students to enroll in Running Start and attend Wenatchee Valley College for grades 11 and 12, or attend North Central Skills Center in Olds Station. The School District does maintain Westside High School, an alternative high school, and the Valley Academy of Learning, which is an alternative education program <b>where</b> <b>parents</b> play the active role in education of their children.|$|E

500|$|... "Schoolin' Life" [...] is an uptempo R and funk song, which {{contains}} elements of disco and dance-pop. Built on a 1980s-inspired beat, the song's instrumentation includes old school synthesizers, 1980s-sounding drum kits wailing electric guitars, and horns. Music critics, including Jamie Peck of MTV noted that [...] "Schoolin' Life" [...] {{was inspired by}} the prime work of Prince, particularly because of its lyrical content, the instruments used, and Knowles' style of singing on it. Lyrically, the song finds Knowles detailing her experiences as she was growing up. In the first verse, she employs guttural vocals to address many life lessons to [...] "20-somethings", [...] "30-somethings", [...] "40-somethings", and [...] "50-somethings". Knowles warns them against some consequences, affirming [...] "time really moves fast" [...] and that growing up fast will leave them wanting more. Knowles also talks about still excelling in a world <b>where</b> <b>parents</b> try to shield everything, [...] "Mom and dad tried to hide the world / Said the world's just too big for a little girl / Eyes wide open can't you see / I had my first heels by the age of 13".|$|E
500|$|Townshend {{had been}} looking at way of {{progressing}} beyond the standard three minute pop single format since 1966. Co-manager Kit Lambert shared Townshend's views and encouraged him to develop musical ideas, {{coming up with the}} term [...] "rock opera". The first use of the term was applied to a suite called [...] "Quads", set in a future <b>where</b> <b>parents</b> could choose the sex of their children. A couple want four girls but instead receive three girls and a boy, raising him as a girl anyway. The opera was abandoned after writing a single song, the hit single, [...] "I'm a Boy". When the Who's second album, A Quick One ran short of material during recording, Lambert suggested that Townshend should write a [...] "mini-opera" [...] to fill the gap. Townshend initially objected, but eventually agreed to do so, coming up with [...] "A Quick One, While He's Away", which joined short pieces of music together into a continuous narrative. During 1967, Townshend learned how to play the piano and began writing songs on it, taking his work more seriously. That year's The Who Sell Out included a mini-opera in the last track, [...] "Rael", which like [...] "A Quick One..." [...] was a suite of musical segments joined together.|$|E
