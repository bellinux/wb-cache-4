The potshots at True Blood and Showgirls also fell flat because they felt like beating a dead horse, but I’ll take <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get.</b> When the main plot makes coherent sense, the B-plot makes me laugh consistently through simple but effective comedic escalation, and the cutaways don’t fill the room with groans, Family Guy succeeds. This is a decidedly above-average episode, and one that didn’t get dragged down by the little bits that didn’t work. It’s not as good as “Back to the Pilot,” which remains the high water mark of the season so far, but “The Blind Side” can rest comfortably in second place for now." ...|$|R

According to the Church's Miami webpage, Mayor Regalado spoke at its inauguration, along with other city and county officials. “To me, the Church of Scientology is very simple,” he told the crowd. “You learn, you work, you think positive and you help people. For that, and many another reasons, you are a good fit for our city.” Mayor Regalado further explained how, “Miami is a gateway to the American Dream. And you have now opened those gates by transforming a cold, sterile building into a vibrant center. ...And your hours of volunteerism will change lives, no doubt about that.
