5|$|Another {{contribution}} of gyroscopic effects is a roll moment {{generated by the}} front wheel during countersteering. For example, steering left causes a moment to the right. The moment is small compared to the moment generated by the out-tracking front <b>wheel,</b> <b>but</b> begins {{as soon as the}} rider applies torque to the handlebars and so can be helpful in motorcycle racing. For more detail, see the section countersteering, below, and the countersteering article.|$|E
5|$|Michael Armstrong {{was born}} into an Irish {{traveller}} family in Longford, Ireland. His mother went into labour with him while driving, so his partially sighted father took over the <b>wheel</b> <b>but</b> crashed the car into a lamp post {{on the way to}} the hospital; Michael was delivered in the back seat. The Armstrong family moved to Ballymun, Dublin, and, when Michael was age nine, to Manchester, England.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} lap {{a number of}} drivers were forced to retire with broken wheels. Both Darracq drivers, A. Rawlinson and Algernon Lee Guinness, {{suffered}} from the issue; Rawlinson broke his in Ramsey, while Lee Guinness hit a well at Hilberry. A. J. Dew also broke a <b>wheel,</b> <b>but</b> continued the race in W. H. Warren's car; both being entered by J. W. H. Dew. A fourth driver, {{in one of the}} White steam cars, succumbed to the same problem, while A. J. Hancock crashed his Vauxhall into a tree, also breaking a wheel. Napier was once again the quickest driver around the circuit, followed by Percy Northey in a Rolls Royce, and Norman Littlejohn in the Vinot-Deguingand.|$|E

5|$|Quinziato, {{the weakest}} climber {{of the three}} leading riders, {{attacked}} at {{the summit of the}} Denderoordberg, the penultimate climb of the day, quickly dropping Lampaert. Leukemans attempted to hold Quinziato's <b>wheel,</b> <b>but</b> was dropped on the flat. Quinziato soon had half a minute's lead and entered the base of the Muur alone. He had more difficulty on the climb, however: as Leukemans and Lampaert reached the cobbles, they quickly began to catch him. Quinziato eventually crossed the line with just a few seconds to spare. This was the second professional victory of his career, nine years after his first, which had come in the 2006 Eneco Tour. Wellens finished in a large group 42 seconds back and sealed his overall victory in the race.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologists {{since the}} 1960s have {{distinguished}} brochs from smaller structures of similar construction, usually called duns. The heaviest {{evidence of the}} occupation of crannogs was in this era, but they {{would continue to be}} used until the Middle Ages. This period also saw the beginnings of wheelhouses, a roundhouse with a characteristic outer wall, within which was a circle of stone piers (bearing a resemblance to the spokes of a <b>wheel),</b> <b>but</b> these would flourish most in the era of Roman occupation. There is evidence for about 1,000 Iron Age hillforts in Scotland, most located below the Clyde-Forth line. The majority are circular, with a single palisade around an enclosure. Most are relatively small, covering one or two acres, but some are much larger as at Castle O'er, Birrenwark, Cadimuir, Cadroner and White Meldon. They appear to have been largely abandoned in the Roman period, but some seem to have been reoccupied after their departure.|$|E
5|$|The peloton rode hard on {{the flat}} roads {{approaching}} the incline at the finish. Astana, Tinkoff-Saxo, Sky and Katusha all contributed {{at the front of}} the group before the sprinters' teams took over. MTN-Qhubeka was the first of these, while Cofidis were unable to position Bouhanni correctly. , who had not been involved in the chase for most of the stage, came to the front for the final section, with its several tight corners. Degenkolb was the first to open the sprint with Sagan on his <b>wheel,</b> <b>but</b> 's Caleb Ewan was able to come past both of them to take the stage victory. Degenkolb was second and Sagan third. The stage was Ewan's first Grand Tour stage victory: the Vuelta was his first Grand Tour and came in the first year of his professional career.|$|E

25|$|Catherine {{was then}} scourged and imprisoned, {{during which time}} over 200 people came to see her, {{including}} Maxentius' wife, Valeria Maximilla; all converted to Christianity and were subsequently martyred. Upon the failure of Maxentius to make Catherine yield by way of torture, he tried to win the beautiful and wise princess over by proposing marriage. The saint refused, declaring that her spouse was Jesus Christ, to whom she had consecrated her virginity. The furious emperor condemned Catherine to death on a spiked breaking <b>wheel,</b> <b>but,</b> at her touch, it shattered. Maxentius finally had her beheaded.|$|E
25|$|Most bicycle hubs {{incorporate}} a freewheel {{to allow the}} pedals to remain stationary while the bicycle is in motion, so that the rider can coast, i.e., ride without pedalling using forward momentum. A fixed-gear drivetrain has the drive sprocket (or cog) threaded or bolted directly to {{the hub of the}} back wheel, so that the pedals are directly coupled to the wheel. During acceleration, the pedal crank drives the <b>wheel,</b> <b>but</b> in other situations, the rear wheel can drive the pedal cranks. This direct coupling allows a cyclist to apply a braking force with the legs and bodyweight, by resisting the rotation of the cranks. It also makes it possible to cycle backwards.|$|E
25|$|The {{fuselage}} of the 703 {{was entirely}} ply skinned, tapering gently from a blunt {{nose to the}} tail. There, a small, ply skinned fin carried a largely fabric covered, rounded, wide chord, balanced rudder which extended down to the keel. The straight tapered tailplane, also largely fabric covered, was set forward of the fin {{and at the top}} of the fuselage, so the elevators required only a small cut-out for the rudder to move in. The pilot sat upright just ahead of the wing leading edge under a multi-piece canopy which merged into the aft fuselage. The 703 had no landing <b>wheel</b> <b>but</b> just a sprung skid from the nose to behind the cockpit, on the deepest part of the fuselage. It was assisted by a tail bumper.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} Iron Age, from the seventh century, {{cellular}} houses {{began to be}} replaced on the northern isles by simple Atlantic roundhouses, substantial circular buildings with a dry stone construction. From about 400, more complex Atlantic roundhouses began to be built, as at Howe, Orkney and Crosskirk, Caithness. The most massive constructions that date from this era are the circular broch towers, probably dating from about 200.

500|$|Each {{end of each}} caisson is {{supported}} on small wheels, which run on rails on the inside face of the [...] diameter holes {{at the ends of}} the arms. The rotation is controlled by a train of gears: an alternating pattern of three [...] diameter ring gears and two smaller idler gears, all with external teeth, as shown in the picture. The large central gear is fitted loosely over the axle at its machine-room end and fixed in place prevent it from rotating. The two smaller gears are fixed to each of the arms of the wheel at its machine-room end. When the motors rotate the central axle, the arms swing and the small gears engage the central gear, which results in the smaller gears rotating at a higher speed than the <b>wheel</b> <b>but</b> in the same direction. The smaller gears engage the large ring gears {{at the end of the}} caissons, driving them at the same speed as the <b>wheel</b> <b>but</b> in the opposite direction. This cancels the rotation due to the arms and keeps the caissons stable and perfectly level.|$|E

As the race reached the paved section he went on a solo attack, at which point he was told that [...] rider Raymond Poulidor was chasing him down. Simpson increased his speed, catching the publicity and press vehicles ahead (known as the caravane). A press car swerved to avoid a pothole; this forced him into a roadside ditch. Simpson fell, damaging his front wheel and injuring his knee. He found his team car and collected a replacement <b>wheel,</b> <b>but</b> by then the front of the race had passed. Back in the race he crashed twice more, finishing 88th.|$|E

Comparisons between Coldplay and U2 became increasingly common.

The largest constructions that date from this era are the circular broch towers, probably dating from about 200 BCE.
