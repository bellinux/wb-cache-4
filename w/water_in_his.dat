When Truman was a boy, his {{character}} {{on the show}} was killed off to instill a fear of <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> son that would prevent Truman from leaving the set; however, he sneaks back onto the set when Truman is an adult. This causes Truman to begin questioning his staged life, and {{as he tries to}} get away from it the writers are forced to write a plot in which Kirk had not drowned but had suffered from amnesia.|$|E
5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{has been}} deeply distraught since Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) was {{abducted}} by aliens. One morning, she arrives in her partner's office {{to find it}} being searched by FBI agents. Scully subsequently learns that the Bureau's newly promoted deputy director, Alvin Kersh (James Pickens, Jr.), has launched a manhunt in search for Mulder. The investigation is being led by an FBI special agent named John Doggett. Scully and Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) are taken to the task force's field office to be questioned, despite protests {{that they would be}} the most qualified to lead the manhunt themselves. As Skinner is being interrogated, Scully is accosted by an unnamed person who starts asking her about Mulder. When Scully finds out that he is actually Doggett (Robert Patrick), she angrily throws <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> face and leaves.|$|E
5|$|Michelle {{undergoes}} a session of regression hypnosis, where she {{claims to be}} twenty-four years old. She suddenly starts screaming in panic about someone trying to kill her, and the session is ended. Mulder reviews the video of the session, and {{is convinced that the}} girl is the reincarnation of Morris, having been conceived right around the time the detective was murdered. The tape contains a brief section of static noise just before Michelle begins screaming, which Mulder has an expert clean up. The noise is found to contain a grainy image of {{what appears to be a}} fish tank ornament of a man in an atmospheric diving suit. Meanwhile, Scully has tracked down Morris' autopsy findings, which show the presence of salt <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> respiratory tract, indicating he died of drowning. The agents realise from these findings that Morris was drowned in the exotic fish tank in Fiore's house.|$|E

25|$|Ganga is a consort to {{all three}} major male deities of Hinduism. As Brahma's partner she always travels {{with him in the}} form of <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> kamandalu (water-pot). She is also Vishnu's consort. She emanates from his foot as Vishnupadi in the avatarana story, and is also, with Lakshmi, his wife. In one popular story, envious of being outdone by each other, the wives begin to quarrel. While Lakshmi {{attempts}} to mediate the quarrel, Ganga and Sarasvati heap misfortune on each other. They curse each other to become rivers, and to carry within them, by washing, the sins of their human worshippers. Soon their husband, Vishnu, arrives and decides to calm the situation by separating the goddesses. He orders Sarasvati to become the wife of Brahma, Ganga to become the wife of Shiva, and Lakshmi, as the blameless conciliator, to remain as his own wife. Ganga and Sarasvati, however, are so distraught at this dispensation, and wail so loudly, that Vishnu is forced to take back his words. Consequently, in their lives as rivers they are still thought to be with him.|$|E

In 2009, The Chronicle of the Horse named Peters and Ravel Horse and Horseman of the Year, and the United States Equestrian Federation (USEF) named Ravel as Horse of the Year. At the time, the Chronicle called him a [...] "natural athlete with a balanced seat and an inherent understanding of the horse. He's calm under pressure and has a reputation for having ice <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> veins." [...] In 2011, riding Weltino's Magic, he took gold in both the team and individual dressage events at the 2011 Pan Am Games. At the 2012 Summer Olympics he came 17th in the individual dressage and was part of the US team which came 6th, again riding Ravel. Peters retired Ravel from competition after the 2012 Olympic Games, after over 40 Grand Prix wins, and the same year the horse was inducted into the United States Dressage Federation Hall of Fame.|$|E

Hall of Fame closer Goose Gossage said that Rivera's composure under stress gave him the appearance of having [...] "ice <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> veins". Commenting on his ability to remain focused in pressure situations, Rivera said, [...] "When you start thinking, a lot of things will happen... If you don't control your emotions, your emotions will control your acts, and that's not good." [...] His ability to compartmentalize his successes and failures impressed fellow reliever Joba Chamberlain, who said, [...] "He's won and lost some of the biggest games in the history of baseball, and he's no worse for the wear when he gives up a home run." [...] Rivera explained the need to quickly forget bad performances, saying [...] "the game that you're going to play tomorrow {{is not going to be}} the same game that you just played." [...] Derek Jeter called him the [...] "most mentally tough" [...] teammate with whom he had ever played.|$|E
500|$|In small pools, predators {{are mostly}} absent and [...] {{competition}} between tadpoles becomes the variable that constrains their survival. Certain frog species avoid this competition by {{making use of}} smaller phytotelmata (water-filled leaf [...] or small woody cavities) as sites for depositing a few tadpoles. [...] While these smaller rearing sites are free from competition, they also lack sufficient nutrients to support a tadpole without parental assistance. Frog species that changed {{from the use of}} larger to smaller phytotelmata have evolved a strategy of providing their offspring with nutritive but unfertilized eggs. The female strawberry poison-dart frog (Oophaga pumilio) lays her eggs on the forest floor. The male frog guards them from predation and carries <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> cloaca to keep them moist. When they hatch, the female moves the tadpoles on her back to a water-holding bromeliad or other similar water body, depositing just one in each location. She visits them regularly and feeds them by laying one or two unfertilized eggs in the phytotelma, continuing to do this until the young are large enough to undergo metamorphosis. The granular poison frog (Oophaga granulifera) looks after its tadpoles in a similar way.|$|E

500|$|In the Shiva Purana, the Bhagavata Purana, and the Vishnu Purana, the rakshasa disguises {{himself as}} a Brahmin cook and gains entry to the king's kitchen. When Vashishtha arrives in Ayodhya on the king's {{invitation}} for a Shraddha ceremony, or simply dinner, the demon cooks human flesh and offers that to the sage {{on behalf of the}} king. The enraged sage curses him to be transformed into a human-eating rakshasa and wander the forests. The pious king is outraged by the unjust curse and quarrels with the sage. Vashishtha reduces the curse to 12 years when he hears of the rakshasa's deception. But the king is not satisfied. He takes <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hand to cast a curse on Vashishtha, but the queen dissuades him. However, the curse-ridden water cannot be wasted. If thrown on the ground, it will destroy the crop. If thrown in the air, it will spoil the rains. Throwing in any direction would harm some living beings. Ultimately, the king throws the water on his own feet. Since the king's feet become black and white in colour, he gains the epithets Kalmashapada and Kalmasanghri (literally, [...] "pied feet").|$|E
500|$|The RLI troops entered Mozambique led by Major Rod Tarr, officer {{commanding}} of 3 Commando, {{and moved}} by night, resting during the day. The terrain, littered with hidden gullies and patches of thick bush, slowed the advance down considerably, {{as did the}} loss of Tarr on the first day. [...] "During the first day's lay-up Rod Tarr somehow got boiling <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> boot {{and had to be}} casevaced," [...] writes Ian Buttenshaw, then an RLI lieutenant. [...] "The second night was just as bad ..." [...] Although the RLI did not contact any insurgents during its advance, several deserted, but well-established camps were discovered. The Battalion found many more such bases during September and October but all were vacant, the cadres having become aware of the RLI presence and pulled out of the area. The RLI was ultimately withdrawn from Mozambique without having encountered any guerrillas, and the operation was abandoned. Buttenshaw continues: [...] "Although no kills were achieved, a lot of valuable lessons were learned, which would eventually be of use when planning future 'externals'. The major effect of the operation was that it certainly delayed the [...] incursions and build-up in the area east of the Ruya River." ...|$|E
