5|$|The {{logistical}} {{demands of}} the surrender were formidable. After Japan's capitulation, more than 5,400,000 Japanese soldiers and 1,800,000 Japanese sailors were taken prisoner by the Allies. The damage done to Japan's infrastructure, combined <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>severe</b> famine in 1946, further complicated the Allied efforts to feed the Japanese POWs and civilians.|$|E
5|$|By 2009 {{some of the}} {{conditions}} required for a currency war had returned, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>severe</b> economic downturn seeing global trade in that year decline by about 12%. There was a widespread concern among advanced economies {{about the size of}} their deficits; they increasingly joined emerging economies in viewing export led growth as their ideal strategy. In March 2009, even before international co-operation reached its peak with the 2009 G-20 London Summit , economist Ted Truman {{became one of the first}} to warn of the dangers of competitive devaluation. He also coined the phrase competitive non-appreciation.|$|E

After his diagnosis, he began receiving treatment and continued to receive therapy and special education support until his junior year of high school. During Cho's last two years at Virginia Tech, several instances of his abnormal behavior, as well as plays and other writings he submitted containing references to violence, caused concern among teachers and classmates.|$|E

5|$|This policy, {{known as}} malgachization, coincided <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>severe</b> {{economic}} downturn and a dramatic {{decline in the}} quality of education. Those schooled during this period generally failed to master the French language or many other subjects and struggled to find employment, forcing many to take low-paying jobs in the informal or black market that mired them in deepening poverty. Excepting the brief presidency of Albert Zafy, from 1992 to 1996, Ratsiraka remained in power from 1975 to 2001 and failed to achieve significant improvements in education throughout his tenure.|$|E
5|$|Freiza {{became a}} handful with Goku but was bested yet again. However, with his Commanders help, {{defeated}} Goku <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>severe</b> shot {{when he was}} no longer focused. Vegeta then came in to fight Frieza being able to transform to the form as well. Vegeta outmatched Frieza showing the flaw of his new form where his body hasn't been used to the energy that gets consumed. Out of desperation, Frieza had destroyed Earth but with Whis' do over ability, Goku was able to prevent Frieza from destroying the Earth after being too over confident against {{him in the first place}} and destroys him once more.|$|E
5|$|In early October 1944, Landis {{checked into}} St. Luke's Hospital in Chicago, {{where his wife}} Winifred had been hospitalized, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>severe</b> cold. While in the hospital, {{he had a heart}} attack, causing him to miss the World Series {{for the first time in}} his commissionership. He {{remained}} fully alert, and as usual signed the World Series share checks to players. His contract was due to expire in January 1946; on November 17, 1944, baseball's owners voted him another seven-year term. However, on November 25, he died surrounded by family, five days after his 78thbirthday. His longtime assistant, Leslie O'Connor, wept as he read the announcement for the press. Landis is buried at Oak Woods Cemetery in Chicago.|$|E

5|$|In game {{three of}} the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals, Horton {{suffered}} a devastating late hit by Vancouver Canucks defenseman Aaron Rome. Rome received a five-minute major for interference and a game misconduct. Horton was unresponsive as he was carried out on a stretcher and put into an ambulance. He was moving all his extremities in the ambulance. He was later diagnosed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>severe</b> concussion and missed {{the remainder of the}} 2011 Stanley Cup Finals. This was arguably the turning point in the series, as the Bruins would go on to win 4 of the next 5 games, and score 21 of the next 25 goals after the hit. Rome was suspended for 4 games. Although Horton missed the remainder of the finals, he was able to hoist the Stanley Cup in Vancouver on June 15 after the Bruins won game 7.|$|E
5|$|In late 1939, the Southern Railway, {{until then}} {{primarily}} a high-density commuter railway serving London and South-East England, {{much of it}} electrified with third-rail pick-up, found itself on the British front line of the Second World War, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>severe</b> lack of modern freight-handling capability. The newest freight design was the Q Class 0-6-0 of 1938, the last locomotive designed by Richard Maunsell. Built to essentially Victorian era principles, these had been designed as replacements {{for many of the}} older 0-6-0s inherited by the Southern Railway in 1923, and entered service in January 1938. Maunsell, having retired at the end of October 1937, was replaced by Oliver Bulleid.|$|E
5|$|In the 1907 season, McGinnity {{finished}} with an 18–18 {{record with a}} 3.16 ERA, allowing more than a hit per inning {{for the first time}} since the 1901 season. He missed the beginning of the 1908 season <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>severe</b> fever. In June 1908, Brush put McGinnity on waivers, hoping another owner would relieve him of McGinnity's $5,000 salary ($ in current dollar terms). He tried to wave McGinnity again in August, but both times McGinnity went unclaimed. Despite this, McGinnity reverted to his old form: from August 22 through the end of the season, McGinnity had an 11–7 record, five shutouts, a 2.27 ERA, and an NL-leading five saves. The Giants released McGinnity on February 27, 1909, when McGinnity decided to pay for his own release.|$|E

5|$|Kinkaid was {{detached}} {{with the}} cruisers Astoria, Minneapolis and New Orleans, and four destroyers on 11 May 1942 and sailed for Nouméa, while Fletcher took {{the rest of}} Task Force 17 to Tongatapu. Kinkaid then headed north to join the Vice Admiral William F. Halsey's Task Force 16. Kinkaid's force became part of its screen which was {{under the command of}} Rear Admiral Raymond A. Spruance. Shortly after Task Force 16 returned to Pearl Harbor, Halsey was hospitalized <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>severe</b> case of dermatitis and, on his recommendation, was replaced as commander of Task Force 16 by Spruance. Kinkaid then became commander of the screen, also known as Task Group 16.2. He was one of only four American flag officers present during the subsequent Battle of Midway. However, he saw little action, as Task Force 16 did not come under attack.|$|E
5|$|On Queen Elizabeth's {{accession}} in November 1558 Dudley {{was appointed}} Master of the Ordnance, in which capacity {{he was to}} unofficially assist William the Silent in his struggle against Spain by delivering English weaponry. As the senior member of his family, Dudley was created Earl of Warwick in December 1561. In 15621563 he commanded the army Elizabeth sent to Le Havre to garrison the town and assist the Huguenots in the First French War of Religion. This campaign ended in failure when the French belligerents agreed on a peace and the English surrendered because of the plague which was decimating their ranks. Dudley, who had acted honorably throughout, returned <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>severe</b> leg wound which was to hinder his further career and ultimately led to his death 27 years later. His last military engagement was against the Northern rebels in 1569. From 1573 {{he served as a}} privy councillor.|$|E
5|$|On Thursday, December 12, 1799, Washington {{spent several}} hours {{inspecting}} his plantation on horseback, in snow, hail, and freezing rain; that evening, he ate his supper without changing from his wet clothes. He awoke {{the next morning}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>severe</b> sore throat and became increasingly hoarse as the day progressed, yet still rode out in the heavy snow, marking trees for cutting on the plantation. Some time around 3a.m. that Saturday, he suddenly awoke with severe difficulty breathing and almost completely unable to speak or swallow. He was {{a firm believer in}} bloodletting, which was a standard medical practice of that era, and he had used it to treat various ailments of slaves on his plantation. He ordered estate overseer Albin Rawlins to remove nearly a pint of his blood.|$|E

5|$|Other {{laboratory}} abnormalities {{may suggest}} poisoning, especially {{the presence of}} a metabolic acidosis, particularly if it is characterized by a large anion gap. Large anion gap acidosis is usually present during the initial stage of poisoning. However, acidosis has a large number of differential diagnosis, including poisoning from methanol, salicylates, iron, isoniazid, paracetamol, theophylline, or from conditions such as uremia or diabetic and alcoholic ketoacidosis. The diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning should be considered in any patient <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>severe</b> acidosis. Urine microscopy can reveal needle or envelope-shaped calcium oxalate crystals in the urine which can suggest poisoning; although these crystals may not be present until the late stages of poisoning. Finally, many commercial radiator antifreeze products have fluorescein added to enable radiator leaks to be detected using a Wood's lamp. Following ingestion of antifreeze products containing ethylene glycol and fluorescein, a Wood's lamp may reveal fluorescence of a patient’s mouth area, clothing, vomitus, or urine which can help to diagnose poisoning.|$|E
5|$|An infant <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>severe</b> heart {{condition}} is admitted in neonatology, and is revealed {{to have been}} abandoned in a schoolyard by his biological mother, whose identity lies between four pre-adolescents. Montgomery quickly becomes emotionally involved in the case, reliving the feelings she went through after aborting the child conceived with Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane). Shepherd and O'Malley get quarantined after an outburst at the hospital, due to a patient suspected of having the plague. Their incapacity to leave the hospital leads to numerous confessions between the two, including Shepherd's reveal of his desire to divorce his wife and reconcile with Grey. Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) takes {{a leave of absence}} from the hospital, in a continuous attempt to bond with the grieving interns, who do not approve of her relationship with O'Malley. When a patient, Giselle Toussant (Elizabeth Goldstein), is admitted to the hospital, and ultimately dies in Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson)'s care, she begins to question her abilities as a surgeon, due to the guilt over the death of both Toussant and Duquette, whom she also performed surgery on. At the conclusion of the episode, Stevens overcomes her grief and gets off the floor, which metaphorically expresses her desire to move on.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the tour, Hammond fell seriously ill; {{according}} to him, a mosquito stung him in the groin area, close to a strain he had suffered, causing blood poisoning. Playing against Jamaica, he moved awkwardly and his team-mates observed him to be in pain. He missed the remaining matches of the tour, and none of the doctors he saw were able to help. On the journey home, during which no doctor was available, his condition worsened, confining him to his cabin <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>severe</b> fever for most of the trip. The day after his arrival home, in April 1926, Hammond had the first of 12operations at the nursing home to which he was taken. His condition worsened {{to the point where the}} doctors believed he would die; they considered amputating his leg, a suggestion vetoed by his mother out of concern for his career. Hammond later claimed that his illness remained a mystery to those treating him. A visit from Warner encouraged Hammond to believe recovery was possible, and he began a slow return to health about a month after his return to England. By July, he could watch Gloucestershire playing in Bristol, though he missed the entire 1926 season. No official announcement about Hammond's illness was made, other than to say he was in a nursing home. Although the cause of the illness was never made clear, David Foot has argued that it was syphilis or a related sexually transmitted disease. He has also suggested that its treatment, which in the days before antibiotics probably involved mercury, adversely affected Hammond's subsequent character and personality, leading to moody and depressive behaviour. Rumours of this nature circulated among his contemporaries for many years before Foot published his theory. That winter, Hammond coached in South Africa, where it was felt the climate might aid his recovery.|$|E
