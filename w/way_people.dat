5|$|The new {{ideals of}} humanism, {{although}} more secular in some aspects, developed against a Christian backdrop, {{especially in the}} Northern Renaissance. Much, if not most, of the new art was commissioned by or in dedication to the Church. However, the Renaissance {{had a profound effect}} on contemporary theology, particularly in the <b>way</b> <b>people</b> perceived the relationship between man and God. Many of the period's foremost theologians were followers of the humanist method, including Erasmus, Zwingli, Thomas More, Martin Luther, and John Calvin.|$|E
5|$|I {{started doing}} {{different}} charity events where I did {{a combination of}} 'Never Too Far' and 'Hero'. We made it into a medley {{and put them in}} the same key and made it work. People responded really well to it. It's been interesting for me, since the events of September11, the <b>way</b> <b>people</b> have been playing 'Hero' and really even talking to me about 'Never Too Far', 'cause that song is also about loss. I figured that it would be a nice thing to do, to put them both out for Christmas. There's also an unreleased track on the B-side, which is called 'There for Me' which kind of has the same sentiment. The proceeds from 'Never Too Far' and 'Hero' and 'There for Me' are going to go to the Heroes Fund, and it's going to benefit police officers' families, relief workers' families.|$|E
5|$|Mel {{tries to}} return to Tlanth, with Debegri, Shevraeth and (ostensibly) his cousin the Duke of Savona in pursuit. Along the <b>way</b> <b>people</b> of the {{countryside}} assist her, but Debegri eventually captures Mel, furious about the months of trouble she caused. Taken to Debegri's nearby fortress, Shevraeth unexpectedly frees her and takes her to Renselaeus where she finds Bran. Shevraeth and his father reveal {{that they had been}} secretly fighting Galdran for years, wish to form an alliance with the Astiars, and plan for Shevraeth to take the throne. However, Mel refuses their help still deeply distrustful of Shevraeth and thinking of the promise made by Bran herself to their father: to become Remalna's rulers. Mel also thinks of Shevraeth as insincere, having been taught by her father to distrust of anyone who resides at court.|$|E

25|$|Changes in the <b>way</b> <b>people</b> {{perceive}} attachment tend {{to occur}} {{with changes in}} the <b>way</b> <b>people</b> perceive support. One study looked at college students' perceptions of attachment to their mothers, fathers, same-sex friends, and opposite-sex friends and found that when students reported changes in attachment for a particular relationship, they usually reported changes in support for that relationship as well. Changes in attachment for one relationship {{did not affect the}} perception of support in other relationships. The link between changes in attachment and changes in support was relationship-specific.|$|E

Maquilón, Mirete, García-Sánchez, and Hernández (2013) demonstrated that the way students view their learning process determines the learning approach (combination of motivation and strategies) they adopt to overcome the academic challenges they face during their education.|$|R

The coming of the Interstate Highway System revolutionized the <b>way</b> <b>people</b> traveled throughout the region. Several urban renewal projects tore down sections of the downtown area to make way for public buildings and transportation improvements. New public schools, a new hospital, and many commercial centers were built during this period.

Regarding to verification function, there are several techniques to match fingerprints such as correlation-based matching, minutiae-based matching, ridge feature-based matching and minutiae-based algorithm. However, the most popular algorithm was minutiae based matching algorithm due to its efficiency and accuracy.|$|E

25|$|The Revolution did {{revolutionize}} social relations.

It did give to ordinary people a pride and power, not to say an arrogance, that have continued to shock visitors from less favored lands. It may have left standing a host of inequalities that have troubled us ever since. But it generated the egalitarian view of human society that makes them troubling and makes our world so different from the own in which the revolutionists had grown up.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} morning, Granger teaches Montag and {{the others}} about the legendary phoenix and its endless cycle of long life, death in flames, and rebirth. He adds that the phoenix must have some relationship to mankind, which constantly repeats its mistakes. Granger explains that man has something the phoenix does not: mankind can remember its mistakes and try never to repeat them. Granger then muses that a large factory of mirrors should be built, so that <b>way</b> <b>people</b> can take {{a long look at}} themselves and reflect on their lives.

25|$|In 1668, Italian {{physician}} Francesco Redi disproved {{the theory}} of spontaneous generation. The accepted theory of Redi's day claimed that maggots developed spontaneously from rotting meat. In an experiment, he used samples of rotting meat that were either fully exposed to the air, partially exposed to the air, or not exposed to air at all. Redi showed that both fully and partially exposed rotting meat developed fly maggots, whereas rotting meat that was not exposed to air did not develop maggots. This discovery completely changed the <b>way</b> <b>people</b> viewed the decomposition of organisms and prompted further investigations into insect life cycles and into entomology in general.|$|E

25|$|DeNeve (1999) {{argued that}} there are three trends in the {{relationship}} between personality and SWB. Firstly, SWB is closely tied to traits associated with emotional tendencies (emotional stability, positive affectivity, and tension). Secondly, relationship enhancing traits (e.g. trust, affiliation) are important for subjective well-being. Happy people tend to have strong relationships and be good at fostering them. Thirdly, the <b>way</b> <b>people</b> think about and explain events is important for subjective well-being. Appraising events in an optimistic fashion, having a sense of control, and making active coping efforts facilitates subjective well-being. Trust, a trait substantially related to SWB, as opposed to cynicism involves making positive rather than negative attributions about others. Making positive, optimistic attributions rather than negative pessimistic ones facilitates subjective well-being.|$|E
25|$|Collective {{intelligence}} strongly {{contributes to}} the shift of knowledge and power from the individual to the collective. According to Eric S. Raymond (1998) and JC Herz (2005), open source intelligence will eventually generate superior outcomes to knowledge generated by proprietary software developed within corporations (Flew 2008). Media theorist Henry Jenkins sees collective intelligence as an 'alternative source of media power', related to convergence culture. He draws attention to education and the <b>way</b> <b>people</b> are learning to participate in knowledge cultures outside formal learning settings. Henry Jenkins criticizes schools which promote 'autonomous problem solvers and self-contained learners' while remaining hostile to learning through the means of collective intelligence. Both Pierre Lévy (2007) and Henry Jenkins (2008) support the claim that collective intelligence is important for democratization, as it is interlinked with knowledge-based culture and sustained by collective idea sharing, and thus contributes {{to a better understanding}} of diverse society.|$|E
25|$|Boas took up {{geography}} {{as a way}} {{to explore}} his growing interest in the relationship between subjective experience and the objective world. At the time, German geographers were divided over the causes of cultural variation. Many argued that the physical environment was the principal determining factor, but others (notably Friedrich Ratzel) argued that the diffusion of ideas through human migration is more important. In 1883, encouraged by Theobald Fischer, Boas went to Baffin Island to conduct geographic research on the impact of the physical environment on native Inuit migrations. The first of many ethnographic field trips, Boas culled his notes to write his first monograph titled The Central Eskimo, which was published in 1888 in the 6th Annual Report from the Bureau of American Ethnology. Boas lived and worked closely with the Inuit peoples on Baffin Island, and he developed an abiding interest in the <b>way</b> <b>people</b> lived.|$|E
