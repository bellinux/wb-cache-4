At first it attracted support mainly from the country's non-Muslim intellectuals; politically {{it was much more}} radical and nationalistic than its main rival, the Muslim-dominated Chadian Democratic Union (UDT).

As the Underwoods stand over the shallow grave of their long dead son, Scully and Doggett discuss the case.

5|$|At 14:30 on 6 November, UB-45 was departing Varna, Bulgaria, under escort by the Bulgarian {{torpedo boat}} Strogi that had cleared {{a path through}} Russian mines.

A Hertz horn mine exploded between UB-45s control room and engine room <b>with</b> <b>enough</b> force to break the boat in half. UB-45 sank so rapidly that the only survivors were three men on the conning tower and two on deck, all of whom were injured; the other fifteen men on board perished in the attack.

5|$|B'nai Israel was {{the only}} Jewish {{congregation}} in Memphis, and from {{the time it was}} established members were split between traditionalists and reformers.

The members had advertised for their first spiritual leader in Wise's newspaper, The Israelite (along with other English-language Jewish newspapers) {{at the same time they}} advertised for a kosher butcher.

5|$|Critics of {{the policy}} of {{economic}} liberalization pursued during the Menem Presidency argued that Argentina's economic woes were caused by neoliberalism, which had been actively promoted by the U.S. government and the IMF under the Washington Consensus. Others have stressed that the main shortcoming of economic policy-making during the 1990s was that economic reform was not pursued <b>with</b> <b>enough</b> determination. A 2004 report by the IMF's Independent Evaluation Office criticised the IMF's conduct prior to Argentina's economic collapse of 2001, saying the IMF had supported the country's fixed exchange rate for too long, and was too lenient towards fiscal deficits.|$|E

5|$|For many years, the United States {{produced}} more than 90% of commercially usable helium in the world, while extraction plants in Canada, Poland, Russia, and other nations produced the remainder. In the mid-1990s, a new plant in Arzew, Algeria, producing 17million cubic meters (600million cubic feet) began operation, <b>with</b> <b>enough</b> production to cover all of Europe's demand. Meanwhile, by 2000, the consumption of helium within the U.S. had risen to more than 15 million kg per year. In 2004–2006, additional plants in Ras Laffan, Qatar, and Skikda, Algeria were built. Algeria quickly became the second leading producer of helium. Through this time, both helium consumption {{and the costs of}} producing helium increased. From 2002 to 2007 helium prices doubled.|$|E

5|$|IAU {{protocol}} is that discovery {{credit for}} a minor planet goes to whoever first submits {{a report to the}} MPC <b>with</b> <b>enough</b> positional data for a decent orbit determination, and that the credited discoverer has priority in naming it.

However, as a chthonic deity, Ataecina would only have been an appropriate name for an object in orbital resonance with Neptune, which Haumea was not.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} compare {{individual}} striations, examiners must obtain a known sample using the seized weapon.

The spent bullet can be recovered, intact, as the water slows down the bullet before it can reach the tank walls, allowing {{for it to be}} recovered. For faster traveling bullets, such as those fired from high-powered rifles and military style weapons, water tanks cannot be used as the tank will not provide enough stopping power for the projectiles. To examine these weapons, investigators must fire them at a target at a controlled range <b>with</b> <b>enough</b> backing to stop the bullet and collect the spent round after it has been fired.|$|E

The enclosure of freehold lands that began in the later Middle Ages now gained momentum and farms that were once owned by individual farmers were now owned by small groups of wealthy landowners. By the 19th century most of the Rhondda farms and estates were owned by absentee landlords, such as the Marquis of Bute, Earl of Dunraven, Crawshay Bailey of Merthyr and the De Winton family of Brecon.|$|E

5|$|Marlborough had won his {{bridgehead}} {{over the}} Danube, and had put himself between the French and Vienna; yet {{the battle was}} followed by a curious, dragging anti-climax. The Duke was determined to lure the Elector into battle before Tallard arrived with reinforcements, but since the battle on the Schellenberg neither Allied commander could agree on their next move, resulting in a protracted siege of Rain. Due to the initial lack of heavy guns and ammunition (promised by the Empire but not delivered on time) the town did not fall until 16 July. Nevertheless, Marlborough promptly occupied Neuburg which, together with Donauwörth and Rain, provided the Allies <b>with</b> <b>enough</b> fortified bridges across the Danube and Lech rivers to manoeuvre with ease.|$|E
