500|$|A {{defining}} {{characteristic of}} Barbara Gordon is her sense of morality, which {{differs from that of}} Batman and her primary field agent Black Canary. She has demonstrated a willingness to use lethal force, such as in Chuck Dixon's Birds of Prey issue #10, [...] "State of War", which contradicts the methodology used by her closest allies and most DC Comics characters. Dixon stated an interview that [...] "he's less morally conflicted than other characters. She's very 'means to an end' oriented. She sees that sometimes you have to kill to save lives. She's not comfortable with that but accepts it. She would do anything to avoid using deadly force but, <b>when</b> <b>push</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> shove, she'll drop the hammer." [...] She demonstrates a similar moral ambiguity in Gail Simone's Birds of Prey: Of Like Minds when she argues with Black Canary over using illegally obtained information, which denies criminals the right of due process. Although the Huntress has never been opposed to using lethal force, she also comes into conflict with Oracle over the fact that she will use the psychological impact of a mission to subconsciously manipulate her field agents into conforming to her ideology.|$|E
2500|$|At the rally, Tatchell {{argued for}} the [...] "disestablishment of the Church of England {{and the freedom to}} insult the Queen, Prime Minister and Archbishop of Canterbury." [...] Tatchell said that the far-left is [...] "Mired in the immoral morass of {{cultural}} relativism, they no longer endorse Enlightenment values and universal human rights. Their support for free speech is now qualified by so many ifs and buts. <b>When</b> <b>push</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> shove, it is more or less worthless." ...|$|E
2500|$|Additionally, Season Six {{introduces}} Section 31, {{a secret}} {{organization dedicated to}} preserving the Federation's principles regardless of the cost and legitimacy of its methods. In [...] "", the character of Dr. Bashir refuses to join Section 31 and reports its actions, but still ponders its significance: [...] "But what would that say about us? That we're no different than our enemies? That <b>when</b> <b>push</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> shove, we're willing to throw away our principles in order to survive?" [...] Sisko replies, [...] "I wish I had an answer for you." ...|$|E

Mal insists that the job is more important, and Book pushes Mal to reconsider. When Book reminds Mal that he gave Inara his word, Mal states that it means nothing. Mal provokes Book by saying that his word was no {{different}} from the Shepherd's preaching, and that <b>when</b> <b>push</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> shove, Book didn't pray, but stole a vehicle and did [...] "what {{needs to be done to}} survive." [...] Book punches Mal in the face.|$|R

The second season for Cohen in Spain proved to be his breakout year and he was courted by Deportivo de La Coruña who agreed to terms with Cohen on a four-year contract. Due to budget issues at Deportivo, the deal was canceled and Cohen traveled to Israel to visit family and friends. During this visit, he went on a week-long trial at F.C. Ashdod. <b>When</b> <b>push</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> shove, no final offers had been made and Cohen returned to Spain to play for UD Salamanca.|$|R

5000|$|Almost {{from the}} beginning, Psi-Force {{was one of}} the New Universe's most popular series. Danny Fingeroth, the regular writer from issue #3 through to #15, remarked that [...] The {{characters}} were well-conceived and designed. As individuals and as a team, they worked very well in an X-Men-ish kind of way. Like an X-Men series, Psi-Force was about a team of ‘hunted and hounded’ superpowered young people who didn’t always get along, but <b>when</b> <b>push</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> shove were always there for each other. Those qualities may have been what readers found most familiar and relatable about them.

5000|$|Colleagues {{have said}} his {{management}} style was low-key, yet effective. Colleague Peter Fisher began working in 1994 with Yamamoto. Fisher said, [...] "He loved {{to work with}} students, making things...He was happiest when he had his hands on some knob, adjusting a mirror, and looking at an oscilloscope." [...] Fisher commented, [...] "Dick was a mild-mannered guy, but <b>when</b> <b>push</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> shove, he {{stood up to the}} system." [...] Fisher described a situation at SLAC when the Center's director was pressuring Yamamoto's team to publish their results, even though the team members were puzzled why two different electron-counting methods produced different results. Yamamoto insisted that they needed to know why the numbers were off, and they only published when they figured it out.|$|R

While she loved her sister Kay, the two had an adversarial relationship, mostly because she knew that Kay was always scheming. <b>When</b> <b>push</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> shove, though, she was there for Kay, refusing to tell their parents that Kay knew Faith was Grace's sister for weeks before the rest of them found out the truth, and that Kay's schemes to get Miguel are the real reason that Faith and Grace never met. In part because she sees their love for each other, and in part to foil her scheming sibling, Jessica has always been a strong supporter of Charity and Miguel.|$|R

[...] Some have claimed that Károlyi stopped treating gymnasts harshly when parents directly requested that he do so.

At this time, the Maharaja was still {{the head of state}} in Mysore (until 1956), the state retained the same boundaries as before independence, and the Arasu community was entrenched in the countryside due to centuries of ties with village communities.

40|$|Little {{undermines}} {{the case for}} a market economy more than the perception that there is injustice in the rewards that it generates. In that sense, the recent financial crisis is a body blow, and has spawned a series of noisy but so far largely ineffectual campaigns for radical change from the Left (e. g., the Occupy Wall Street movement). But the greatest clamor for reform should come from those who support the market system. <b>When</b> <b>push</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> shove, it was the government that <b>came</b> <b>to</b> the rescue of financial institutions and public money that proved to be the cornerstone of the financial system. And there is a more than respectable case that a sizeable transfer of resources from public to private hands have enriched workers in the financial sector at the expense of citizens at large. And this is put into sharp relief by the observation that {{a good deal of the}} increase in inequality that has been seen in recent years is due to bonus pay in the financial sector and beyond...|$|R

As Momal woke up, she saw his cane and {{realized}} Rano had been {{to her room and}} seen her with Somal, rather mistaken Somal to be some man, and perhaps gone for good. This was too much for her.
