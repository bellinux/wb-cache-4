5|$|At the {{appointed}} hour, Duchess appears at Ribby's {{door and the}} party begins. Distracted for a moment, Duchess does not see which oven Ribby opens to remove the pie. Duchess eats greedily, believing she is eating her ham and veal pie. She wonders <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> patty-pan she put in her pie, and, not finding it under the crust, is convinced she has swallowed it. She sets up a howl; Ribby is perplexed and annoyed but leaves to find Dr. Maggoty, a magpie.|$|E
5|$|Arianna {{refuses to}} talk to anyone, however, so Layton and Luke {{continue}} to question the townspeople while Emmy goes to the Scotland Yard for information regarding Evan Barde's death. With the aid of Inspectors Chelmey and Grosky, she uncovers the records for the case before heading back to Misthallery to reunite with Layton and Luke. Inspector Grosky returns with her, hoping that his own influence will help convince the town's Chief of Police, Chief Jakes, to provide further information on the case. Regardless, Chief Jakes remains adamantly opposed to the investigation of Barde's death, and demands that Layton and company leave the town within 24 hours. Despite Jakes' threats, they visit Arianna {{to explain to her}} <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> town and to her father. Arianna opens up to them, and proceeds to guide them to the nearby lake before playing the Specter's Flute, which causes a prehistoric aquatic creature named Loosha to rise from the lake.|$|E
5|$|Lexie's death devastates Meredith, who {{is still}} desperately trying to find her husband. Eventually, she and Shepherd reunite and they fix his hand as best as they can. Meanwhile, back at Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, no one is aware of <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other doctors. Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) prepares the annual dinner for the departing residents, which Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers), Dr. Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams), and Dr. April Kepner (Sarah Drew) are dreading. Avery makes the choice {{to take a job}} offer at Tulane Medical Center, and he and Kepner share a moment. Dr. Ben Warren (Jason George) and Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) decide to get married, even though Warren is going to start his {{surgical}} internship in Los Angeles. After realizing Dr. Teddy Altman (Kim Raver) was offered a chief position at United States Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) and is refusing to leave Seattle out of loyalty, Dr. Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd), the chief of surgery, fires her to free her from the hospital where her husband died. As the episode ends, Hunt picks up his messages to discover the surgical team never made it to Boise. The residents, finally excited to celebrate at Webber's dinner, are left waiting for their stranded friends. The remaining crash survivors are left struggling to stay awake as their last match goes out. In the closing monologue, Meredith repeats the opening to the speech that Webber gave in the pilot episode of the series.|$|E

25|$|The {{medical history}} is a {{longitudinal}} record of <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> patient since birth. It chronicles diseases, major and minor illnesses, as well as growth landmarks. It gives the clinician a feel for what has happened before to the patient. As a result, it may often give clues to current disease state. It includes several subsets detailed below.|$|E
25|$|Set as {{a sequel}} to John Carpenter's 1982 film of the same name, the story focuses on Captain Blake, {{a member of a}} U.S. Special Forces team sent to the Antarctic outpost {{featured}} in the film to determine <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> research team. The game was endorsed by John Carpenter, who voices a character in an uncredited cameo.|$|E

He was not curious <b>to</b> know <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> the airship, nor <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> the battle. For a long time he lay waiting apprehensively for the {{pitching}} and tossing and his qualms to return, and so, lying, boxed up in the locker, he presently fell asleep.|$|R

2500|$|... "One must note {{in passing}} that Amin al-Husseini's memoirs are an {{antidote}} against Holocaust denial: He {{knew that the}} genocide took place and boasted of having been perfectly aware of it from 1943 on. I believe he is an architect of the Nakba (the defeat of 1948 and the departure {{of hundreds of thousands}} of Palestinians who had been driven out of their lands) in the sense that he bears a share of responsibility for <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Palestinian people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Picasso {{began the}} {{painting}} on 11 May 1937, {{working on a}} piece of unbleached muslin (349 cm x 776 cm). Since the work was so large, Picasso had to use a ladder and a long-handled brush to reach the furthest corners of the canvas. He spent over two months creating Guernica. He used only black and white paint to invoke the truth-telling authority of documentary photography. Yet his Cubist use of fragmented imagery makes his a poetic commentary, rather than strident propaganda. [...] "The protest is found in <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bodies, the hands, the soles of the feet, the horse's tongue, the mother's breasts, the eyes in the headâ€”the imaginative equivalent of what happened to them in the flesh. We are made to feel their pain with our own eyes." ...|$|E

60|$|What {{happened}} to me has been in no wise different from <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> socialist movement as a whole in the United States. In the bourgeois mind socialism has changed from a terrible disease to a youthful vagary, and later on had its thunder stolen by the two old parties,--socialism, like a meek and thrifty workingman, being exploited became respectable.|$|E

60|$|Fifthly, If <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> king of Prussia {{is only in}} {{consequence}} of a sort of panic or of levity, and an indisposition to persevere long in one design, the support and concurrence of Russia will tend to steady him, and to give him resolution.
