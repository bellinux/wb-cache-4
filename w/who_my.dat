Then I {{realised}} the magic is me really prying stuff {{out of my head}} and getting it on to tape, and that stuff doesn't happen unless I'm completely alone. Sometimes it's about the right amount of blood sugar, just slightly hungover. And I'm really affected by the weather. If it's too nice outside it's insane for me, the concept of being inside. Everybody talks about this whole technology versus nature thing and if it's anything that is it: look <b>who</b> <b>my</b> best friends are, a bunch of plastic and circuitry and electricity, when I should be running around getting chased by bumblebees.|$|E
500|$|Steve Kloves was {{selected}} to write the screenplay. He described adapting the book as [...] "tough", as it did not [...] "lend itself to adaptation {{as well as the}} next two books." [...] Kloves often received synopses of books proposed as film adaptations from Warner Bros., which he [...] "almost never read", but Harry Potter jumped out at him. He went out and bought the book, and became an instant fan of the series. When speaking to Warner Bros., he stated that the film had to be British, and had to be true to the characters. Kloves was nervous when he first met Rowling as he did not want her to think he was going to [...] " [...] her baby." [...] Rowling admitted that she [...] "was really ready to hate this Steve Kloves," [...] but recalled her initial meeting with him: [...] "The first time I met him, he said to me, 'You know <b>who</b> <b>my</b> favourite character is?' And I thought, You're gonna say Ron. I know you're gonna say Ron. But he said 'Hermione.' And I just kind of melted." [...] Rowling received a large amount of creative control, an arrangement that Columbus did not mind.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Hill collaboratively {{wrote an}} autobiography, , with mountaineer and writer Greg Child, {{published}} by W.W. Norton & Company. As {{she describes the}} process, [...] "He would take my writings and organize them, and he encouraged me to elaborate on certain elements. He emphasized that telling the story is what's important, so he really helped me think about what I wanted to say, and figure out <b>who</b> <b>my</b> audience was." [...] Hill explained {{in an interview that}} writing about past events was easier because she had had time to reflect on them. She wanted to [...] "convey the history and culture of free climbing", specifically how it became as specialized as it is today. She felt that she had a unique perspective to offer, both as someone who climbed at a particular moment in climbing history and as a woman: [...] "And I wonder if a male writer would have presented that information differently. I think the book is important from that stand point , because I am a woman, and there are not many female viewpoints on climbing, or the history of climbing, out there." [...] Writing about climbing in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s was dominated by men. As accomplished American climber and writer Rachel de Silva explains, the six major American climbing magazines published fewer than 12 articles a year by or about women during the 1980s despite women comprising 40% of climbers. It was not until 1990 that the first women-centric climbing books appeared.|$|E

500|$|In June 2010, when Jill's adoptive mother, Liz Foster (Julianna McCarthy), died, it {{was then}} learned that her {{biological}} father was Neil Fenmore. Walton stated: [...] "Liz was the dream mother for Jill. She always could handle Jill." [...] During an interview with On-Air On-Soaps speaking about how her character has been thrown in different directions, Walton said: [...] "It used to bother me. I would try and keep a steady course with it, and now I can’t. Now I just roll with the punches. It’s impossible." [...] Walton noted that Jill was finally {{happy to have a}} blood relative through Neil's other daughter, Lauren Fenmore (Tracey E. Bregman). She said: [...] "Liz dies within a week {{and all of a sudden}} it’s, 'I am a Fenmore'. And we really didn’t have a chance to explore it much, but in real life that happens. My first thought as Jill is, 'I actually know <b>who</b> <b>my</b> blood is, and I have a sister.' And, Jill was very moved and touched and shocked from the death of Liz, but full of love for her sister." [...] On her relationship with Lauren, Walton stated that, [...] "Most people don’t like Jill, and she hasn’t particularly loved Lauren. I have never had that much to do with Lauren, really." [...] Nekeeta Borden of Zap2it noted: [...] "The redhead told Jill in no uncertain terms that she intended to keep her father’s memory, and only child status, firmly in tact [...] and had no interest in a close relationship." [...] Borden also noted that Jill always wanted a sense of belonging, which prompted her to legally change her name to Jill Fenmore. The sisters were initially bitter towards each other having to share half of the Fenmore Boutique, but have since gotten closer. Walton said that, [...] "From my point of view, I think that Lauren has a really big heart; she's a naturally lovely person. Lauren was really awful a few times, and that just came out of her pain. So, it looks like Lauren and Jill are kind of getting along okay, but there's nothing else coming up in the scripts for them yet." ...|$|E

Despite the family connections to USC he was uncertain whether he fit the program's offense. After a positive visit, however, Marinovich chose the university over recent national champions BYU and Miami, as well as Arizona State, Stanford, and Washington. Marinovich took his college selection seriously, noting: [...] "This is the biggest decision of my life. It means not only where I will play football, but most likely, who I will marry, <b>who</b> <b>my</b> best friends for life will be, and where I will live. It means everything. And the one thing I know for sure is I'm too young to make this kind of decision by myself." ...|$|E

I couldn't stand for that, so I ran, and I'm proud I did. It's been a frustrating three years as I've watched Governor Taft drive the state off a cliff. But I've been fighting back." [...] Delev said he agreed with Brinkman {{on most of the}} issues, but that Brinkman's actions in Columbus had made the district [...] "the laughingstock of the state." [...] The Cincinnati Enquirer said both candidates were [...] "rock-ribbed conservatives who agree on most fiscal and social issues," [...] but endorsed Delev.

2500|$|The {{new year}} {{brought about a}} number of changes in Karam's career lives. Najwa's new album was set to be {{released}} in the summer, and her personal changes were showing in her new album Rouh Rouhi. It was similar to the Maghroumeh album, but had a number of tweaks in the vocal and musical styles. The musical arrangements were heavily detailed and technical, and the lyrics were more poetic than all other Karam albums. The tracks [...] "Ariftu Albi La Meen" [...] ("Do you know <b>who</b> <b>my</b> heart belongs to?"), [...] "Atchana" [...] ("Thirsty"), and the title track, [...] "Rouh Rouhi" [...] ("Soul of my Soul") were the major hits off the album, the latter two being shot as music videos. Many other songs succeeded like [...] "Kif Bdawik" [...] ("How Do I Treat You?)", and [...] "Ma Berda Ghayrak" [...] ("I Don't Accept Anyone Beside You").|$|E
2500|$|In 1996, Miho Hatori and Yuka Honda of Cibo Matto {{were invited}} by Ono to remix the song [...] "Talking to the Universe" [...] for a Rising remix EP Rising Mixes. They met Lennon and {{invited him to}} join them on tour as a bass player. This {{eventually}} led to Lennon's contributing to their side-project Butter 08 and to his becoming {{a member of the}} group. He continued to play with them on tour, joining them on television and providing bass guitar and vocals on their EP Super Relax. Through his association with Cibo Matto, Lennon was approached by Adam Yauch (of Beastie Boys), who expressed an interest in his music and persuaded him to sign a record contract with Grand Royal Records. Regarding Grand Royal, Lennon has said:I think I found the only label on the planet who doesn't care <b>who</b> <b>my</b> parents are and what my name is. It's a good feeling to know that I wouldn't have gotten the offer if they wouldn't have liked my songs. That's pretty rare in the music business! ...|$|E

2500|$|David Cantwell {{recalled}} in 2013, [...] "His approach to singing, {{he told me}} once, was to call up those memories and feelings of his own that most closely corresponded to those being felt by the character in whatever song he was performing. He {{was a kind of}} singing method actor, creating an illusion of the real." [...] In the liner notes to Essential George Jones: The Spirit of Country Rich Kienzle states, [...] "Jones sings of people and stories that are achingly human. He can turn a ballad into a catharsis by wringing every possible emotion from it, making it a primal, strangled cry of anguish". [...] In 1994, country music historian Colin Escott pronounced, [...] "Contemporary country music is virtually founded on reverence for George Jones. Walk through a room of country singers and conduct a quick poll, George nearly always tops it." [...] In the wake of Jones's death, Merle Haggard pronounced in Rolling Stone, [...] "His voice was like a Stradivarius violin: [...] one of the greatest instruments ever made." [...] Emmylou Harris wrote, [...] "...when you hear George Jones sing, you are hearing a man who takes a song and makes it a work of art - always," [...] a quote that appeared on the sleeve of Jones' 1976 album The Battle. In the documentary Same Ole Me, several country music stars offer similar thoughts. Johnny Cash: [...] "When people ask me <b>who</b> <b>my</b> favorite country singer is, I say, 'You mean besides George Jones?'"; [...] Randy Travis: [...] "It sounds like he's lived every minute of every word that he sings and there's very few people who can do that"; Tom T. Hall: [...] "It was always Jones who got the message across just right"; and Roy Acuff: [...] "I'd give anything if I could sing like George Jones". [...] In the same film, producer Billy Sherrill states, [...] "All I did was change the instrumentation around him. [...] I don't think he's changed at all." ...|$|E
