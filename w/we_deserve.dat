25|$|Time to Get Tough: Making America #1 Again is a non-fiction book by Donald Trump. It {{was first}} {{published}} in hardcover format by Regnery Publishing in 2011. It was reissued under the new title Time to Get Tough: Make America Great Again! by the same publisher in 2015, to match Trump's 2016 election campaign slogan. Trump had previously published The America <b>We</b> <b>Deserve</b> (2000) as preparation for his attempt to run in the 2000 U.S. presidential campaign with a populist platform. Time to Get Tough in contrast served as his prelude to the 2012 U.S. presidential campaign, with a conservative platform.|$|E
25|$|A {{book review}} from On the Issues written by Jesse Gordon was critical, noting how Trump had flip-flopped on {{political}} views from his prior policy book, The America <b>We</b> <b>Deserve.</b> Gordon {{wrote that the}} book exhibited a swap by Trump on issues from supporting populism to espousing extreme right-wing values. He noted the book's purpose was to prepare his potential 2012 bid for president. Gordon concluded the book was Trump's way of garnering trust among conservatives. On the Issues published a table contrasting how his stated political preferences had changed from 2000, on issues including abortion, gun control, gay rights, tax reform, and health care. Carol Felsenthal of Chicago wrote Trump's verbal style of braggadocio clearly came through in the work.|$|E

500|$|In 1999, The New York Times {{reported}} that Jesse Ventura first approached Trump {{about a possible}} 2000 presidential run while both were in attendance at a wrestling event in Atlantic City. [...] Trump's ambitions may have spawned earlier. The America <b>We</b> <b>Deserve</b> co-writer Dave Shiflett said Trump first thought about running in late 1998, {{when he looked at}} his political advantages in money and name recognition, and concluded that he was [...] "at least as competent" [...] as then President Bill Clinton. According to Shiflett, this prompted Trump to ask top aide Roger Stone to find the [...] "most eminent hack writer in America" [...] to put Trump's political ideas into a book. [...] Stone reached out to Shiflett, a contributor to The American Spectator. In spring 1999, Shiflett met with Trump about the project that would later become The America <b>We</b> <b>Deserve.</b> [...] During the initial meeting, Shiflett claims Trump raised concerns about a suitcase bomb destroying Manhattan.|$|E

I don't think it's politically correct to be given two stars straight away." [...] It retained the single Michelin star in the following edition of the guide, prior to the closure of the restaurant.|$|E

[...] The article, featured on the Yahoo! website Shine, also criticized the books and the author's final word on the series was, [...] "Good books deal with themes of longing and loneliness, sexual passion and human frailty, alienation and fear just as the Twilight books do. But they do so by engaging us with complexities of feeling and subtleties of character, expressed in language that rises above banal mediocrity. Their reward is {{something more than just}} an escape into banal mediocrity. <b>We</b> <b>deserve</b> something better to get hooked on." ...|$|E

500|$|The two-hour premiere episode {{cost up to}} $10 {{million to}} produce, and Cameron {{reportedly}} [...] "brought the pilot in on time and on budget". Subsequent episodes had a considerably smaller budget. Fox spent heavily on the promotional campaign for the premiere, paying for theatrical trailers, billboards, and guerilla marketing. Cameron took a [...] "very basic view" [...] of the show's chance of success, saying: [...] "If it flies, it flies. If it doesn't, it doesn't... If people connect with it, which I hope they will, fine. If we don't find an audience, <b>we</b> <b>deserve</b> to be off the air. It's that simple." [...] Eglee admitted the series had been [...] "routinely overbudget" [...] in the first season, and feared {{that this would be}} a factor in whether or not the show was renewed for a second season, though Cameron downplayed these concerns.|$|E
500|$|Trump {{focused his}} {{campaign}} {{on the issues of}} fair trade, eliminating the national debt, and achieving universal healthcare as outlined in the campaign companion piece The America <b>We</b> <b>Deserve,</b> released in January 2000. [...] He named media proprietor Oprah Winfrey as his ideal running mate and said he would instantly marry his girlfriend, Melania Knauss, to make her First Lady. [...] Critics questioned the seriousness of Trump's campaign and speculated that it was a tactic to strengthen his brand and sell books. [...] Trump defended his candidacy as a serious endeavor and proclaimed that {{he had a chance to}} win the election. [...] Though he never expanded the campaign beyond the exploratory phase, Trump made numerous media appearances as a candidate, traveled to campaign events in Florida, California, and Minnesota, and qualified for two presidential primaries. [...] Veteran campaign strategist and longtime Trump aide Roger Stone was hired as director of the exploratory committee.|$|E
500|$|Trump further {{increased}} speculation of {{a full-scale}} campaign when his publisher Renaissance Books announced a January 2000 release date for The America <b>We</b> <b>Deserve.</b> [...] The publisher's press release announced a book tour and teased, [...] "Donald Trump for President? Run or not, Donald Trump's ideas {{will have a}} major impact on the next presidential election." [...] Trump set January also as the month on which he would decide whether to run. [...] He expressed, [...] "I’m not interested in being the [...] candidate who gets the most votes in the history of the world outside of the Democratic and Republican parties, I would only consider this if I thought I could win." [...] On September 30, Trump wrote an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal titled, [...] "America Needs a President Like Me" [...] in which he argued that he would be [...] "the kind of president America needs in the new millennium." [...] He cited the [...] "repugnant" [...] comments of Buchanan and Ventura's personal encouragement as factors contributing to his decision. [...] In an October 6 interview on Dateline NBC, Trump affirmed that he was [...] "very serious" [...] about his run.|$|E

500|$|Trump officially {{released}} his book The America <b>We</b> <b>Deserve</b> on January 1. Dave Shiflett received credit as co-writer. To promote the book, Trump held a January 5 press conference at Trump Tower, which aired on C-SPAN. [...] He signed books and answered questions from reporters, once asserting, [...] "I {{may be too}} honest to be a politician." [...] Trump's book, consisting of 286 pages, covers Trump's political positions and policy proposals, including strict anti-crime measures, increased pressure on China, fair trade, border control, increased military spending, support for public capital punishment, and the implementation of single-payer health care. [...] It advocates eliminating soft money contributions to political parties and full disclosure of campaign donations to political candidates, but calls {{for the removal of}} limits on the amount of donations, arguing, [...] "f you want to give your life savings to Al Gore, that should be between you, Al Gore and your psychiatrist." [...] In addition, it raises concerns about terrorism, proposing the creation of a national lottery to raise funds for anti-terrorism programs, and offers a choice to North Korea to disarm or face military strikes. [...] The America <b>We</b> <b>Deserve</b> also includes praise for former boxer Muhammad Ali, Teamsters leader James P. Hoffa, as well as Trump's future political opponents Florida governor Jeb Bush and New York governor George Pataki, among others. It cites friendships with baseball player Sammy Sosa and entertainer Sean Combs as making Trump more understanding of racial diversity. Trump later backpedaled his book's praise of Combs after Combs was charged with violating gun laws following a shooting at a New York nightclub. [...] Trump said he did not [...] "know [...] really well." [...] The book condemns Congressman Jerrold Nadler as a [...] "hack" [...] for opposing Trump's development of waterfront real estate in Manhattan, and describes Senator Bob Smith as [...] "the dumbest guy in the U.S. Senate" [...] after he grilled Trump's sister Maryanne Trump Barry on abortion when she testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1999 upon her nomination to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. [...] It criticizes Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley as a [...] "phony" [...] for his Senate sponsorship of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 that purportedly hurt Trump financially. [...] It also notes the hypocrisy of both an unnamed Senator and an unnamed conservative columnist who each engaged in extramarital affairs at Trump's hotels and resorts while they attacked President Clinton for the Lewinsky scandal. [...] In a scathing review, New York Magazine described the book as inadvertently satirical. Booklist pondered whether Trump was [...] "the only man ever to run for president in order to promote a book." [...] Dave Saltonstall of the New York Daily News, labeled it as autobiographical and reported that it contains [...] "enough details to paint a fairly comprehensive picture of what a Trump presidency might look like." ...|$|E
500|$|As the World Trade Organization (WTO) {{negotiations}} collapsed amid protests at {{a summit}} in Seattle, Trump {{appeared on the}} December 5 airing of ABC's This Week. [...] He said that the WTO was not [...] "necessarily fair" [...] to the United States, and argued that [...] "our best, and our smartest, and our brightest" [...] were not being used to negotiate the deal. [...] He renewed his attack on the negotiation skills of Barshefsky, saying that both she and Secretary of Commerce William M. Daley {{did not know how}} to negotiate. Next, Trump embarked on a two-day campaign stop in California, which the media covered extensively. [...] During the stop, Trump held a press conference, appearing with his campaign entourage that included his girlfriend Melania, Roger Stone, and bodyguard Matt Calamari. [...] Aides made hand sanitizer readily available for reporters, presumably due to Trump's alleged germaphobia. [...] The Associated Press (AP) noted that Trump [...] "made little attempt to appear statesman-like" [...] at the press conference with responses that seemed [...] "tailored more to entertain his listeners than establish his credibility." [...] In Burbank, Trump appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno where he attacked Buchanan as [...] "having a love affair with Adolf Hitler" [...] and discussed his upcoming book, The America <b>We</b> <b>Deserve.</b> [...] The Weekly Standard reported that though the release date was only a month away, the book had yet to be written. [...] After the Tonight Show appearance, Trump attended a meeting of one hundred Southern California Reform Party members, to whom he delivered a speech and answered questions. [...] Crowds cheered Trump when he discussed his opposition to NAFTA, but some were offended when he questioned the existence of a Reform Party platform and, after receiving a copy, left it on the podium when he exited. [...] On the final day, Trump visited the Simon Wiesenthal Center's Museum of Tolerance and walked through an exhibit of The Holocaust. [...] He delivered a speech and held another press conference at the museum atrium, where he denounced Buchanan's views on Nazis. [...] Afterwards, Trump boarded his jet for Long Beach. [...] During an on-jet interview, Trump placed his odds of waging a full-scale campaign at [...] "50/50," [...] but [...] "edging closer," [...] believing there to be a [...] "fervor" [...] among the public about his campaign. [...] The AP evaluated the California response as more [...] "warm" [...] than fervent, but described Trump's treatment as that of a [...] "high profile dignitary." [...] At Trump's final event, he spoke at a Tony Robbins motivational conference. [...] Robbins and Trump had made an agreement that would pay Trump $1 million for showing up at ten of Robbins' events. [...] Trump planned to make campaign stops to coincide with Robbins' shows, speculating that he [...] "could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it." [...] At the event, Trump received what the AP called a [...] "moderately enthusiastic applause" [...] after asking the 21,000 people in attendance whether he should run for president. [...] He received a large ovation when he proclaimed, [...] "people want to hear straight talk. We're tired of being bullied by these moron politicians." [...] Overall, The Weekly Standard praised Trump for his candor on the campaign trail.|$|E

2500|$|Time to Get Tough {{functioned as}} a prelude during Trump's {{decision}} process {{about whether or not}} to enter the 2012 U.S. presidential campaign. Trump published his prior book, The America <b>We</b> <b>Deserve</b> (2000), as preparation for his attempt to run in the 2000 U.S. presidential campaign with a populist platform. In contrast, Time to Get Tough was written in order to display Trump's views as a conservative candidate. Time to Get Tough served to show Trump's viewpoints had changed since 2000 to sync more tightly with conservative political ideals.|$|E

[...] Beretta began moving equipment into the Gallatin plant once it received a certificate of occupancy in December 2015, and by January 2016 the plant was partially operational. On 15 April, the company celebrated its factory opening with a ribbon-cutting ceremony officiated by Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam, Ugo Gussalli Beretta and his sons, Pietro and Franco.|$|E

He added, [...] "I think <b>we</b> <b>deserve</b> the same raises everybody else got - modest though they may be. I'm not in the slightest bit embarrassed."
