The club won their first three matches in Group B, against Sparta Prague, Shakhtar Donetsk and Lazio. A draw away to Lazio at the Stadio Olimpico ensured qualification into the second group stage, where they were partnered with Bayern Munich, Lyon and Spartak Moscow. In spite of defender Sylvinho scoring an early goal in their opening game against Spartak Moscow, Arsenal plummeted to a 4–1 defeat, leaving Wenger to assess that [...] "as a team, we didn't look as solid as <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> to." [...] Wins at Lyon and at home to Spartak Moscow helped Arsenal {{to qualify for the}} quarter-finals as the French club failed to capitalise on Arsenal's defeat at Bayern Munich. They faced Spanish club Valencia, winning 2–1 at Highbury but the team were beaten 1–0 at the Estadio Mestalla, knocked-out on aggregate.|$|E

[...] Sciarretto continued to note that {{towards the end of}} the song, the singer does not show any restraint, and that it is a common device used in song production as it allows the singer to build tension. Lyrically, [...] "Collide" [...] is a love song, in which Lewis sings [...] "I'll pick you up when you're down / Be there when no one's around / I'm in tune with how you feel / Everything 'bout this is real / When you're in unfamiliar places / Count on me through life's changes." [...] Sciarretto also noted that it is when Lewis performs the lyric [...] "Crash into me / At full speed," [...] that she allows herself to not hold back in her vocal performance, and delivers it with [...] "power and breadth".|$|E

Torres came under {{criticism}} for apparently refusing to shake the hand of Spanish manager Luis Aragonés after being substituted off. He subsequently denied being angry with the coaching, saying that he was actually [...] "irritated with himself". He scored his first goal of the tournament in Spain's next game, a 2–1 win over Sweden. Torres scored the winner and was named the man of the match in the final against Germany in a 1–0 victory. He said, [...] "It's just a dream come true. This is my first title and I hope it's the first of many.

Galen, like the Hippocratics, was not. For him, to understand a clinical case technically, ‘to diagnose’, was, among other things, to know with greater or lesser certainty the outcome for the patient, ‘to prognosticate’. Prognosis, then, is one of the essential problems and most important objectives of Galenic diagnosis. Galen was concerned to distinguish it from divination or prophecy, both to improve diagnosis technically and to enhance the physician's reputation." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{completing}} her {{commission for}} the archbishop, Cassatt traveled to Madrid and Seville, where she painted {{a group of}} paintings of Spanish subjects, including Spanish Dancer Wearing a Lace Mantilla (1873, in the National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution). In 1874, she {{made the decision to}} take up residence in France. She was joined by her sister Lydia who shared an apartment with her. Cassatt opened a studio in Paris. Louisa May Alcott's sister, Abigail May Alcott, was then an art student in Paris and visited Cassatt. Cassatt continued to express criticism of the politics of the Salon and the conventional taste that prevailed there. She was blunt in her comments, as reported by Sartain, who wrote: [...] "she is entirely too slashing, snubs all modern art, disdains the Salon pictures of Cabanel, Bonnat, all the names <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> to revere".|$|E
2500|$|... he {{conjugal}} love of Leonore appears, to {{the modern}} individual armed with realism and psychology, irremediably abstract and theoretical.... Now that political events in Germany have restored to the concepts of human dignity and liberty their original significance, this is the opera which, {{thanks to the music}} of Beethoven, gives us comfort and courage.... Certainly, Fidelio is not an opera in the sense <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> to, nor is Beethoven a musician for the theater, or a dramaturgist. He is quite a bit more, a whole musician, and beyond that, a saint and a visionary. That which disturbs us is not a material effect, nor the fact of the 'imprisonment'; any film could create the same effect. No, it is the music, it is Beethoven himself. It is this 'nostalgia of liberty' he feels, or better, makes us feel; this is what moves us to tears. His Fidelio has more of the Mass than of the Opera to it; the sentiments it expresses come from the sphere of the sacred, and preach a 'religion of humanity' which we never found so beautiful or necessary as we do today, after all we have lived through. Herein lies the singular power of this unique opera.... Independent of any historical consideration ... the flaming message of Fidelio touches deeply.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Clustering can be {{considered}} as the most critical unsupervised learning problem. So as every other problem of this category, it copes with acquiring a structure in a collection of unlabeled data. A loose definition of clustering could be “the process of organizing objects into groups whose members are similar in some way”. Document clustering is a process of information filtering. In general we use k-means clustering and its variants for this process. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>using</b> 20 Newsgroups (or NG 20) data set and collect the 50 documents randomly. Classification process <b>is</b> <b>used</b> to classify the contents. Stemming process <b>is</b> <b>used</b> to reduce the memory size. For this <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>using</b> Porter Stemming Algorithm. After that Frequency Calculation <b>is</b> <b>used</b> to perform word separation. In final process <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>using</b> k-means clustering process to find out similarity test cases and also term frequency. Here <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>using</b> k-means clustering process for clustering the 20 Newsgroups (or NG 20) data set rather than other clustering processes in order to increase the speed of the 20 Newsgroups (or NG 20) data set clustering...|$|R
