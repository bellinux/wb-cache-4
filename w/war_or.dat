5|$|In addition, the {{outbreak}} {{coincided with the}} deaths and media focus on the First World War. Another explanation involves the age group affected by the disease. The majority of fatalities, from both {{the war and the}} epidemic, were among young adults. The deaths caused by the flu may have been overlooked due to the large numbers of deaths of young men in the <b>war</b> <b>or</b> as a result of injuries. When people read the obituaries, they saw the <b>war</b> <b>or</b> postwar deaths and the deaths from the influenza side by side. Particularly in Europe, where the war's toll was extremely high, the flu may not have had a great, separate, psychological impact, or may have seemed a mere extension of the war's tragedies.|$|E
5|$|Subgenres, not {{necessarily}} distinct, include anti-war, comedy, animated, propaganda, and documentary. There are similarly subgenres {{of the war}} film in specific theatres such as the western desert (North Africa), the Pacific in the Second World <b>War,</b> <b>or</b> Vietnam; and films set in specific domains of war, such as the infantry, the air, at sea, in submarines, or at prisoner of war camps.|$|E
5|$|The {{desert is}} {{generally}} {{thought of as}} a barren and empty landscape.

These events were the longest-running military action in the history of African colonialism.|$|R

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century, France, Switzerland and San Marino were the only European nations to have a republican form of government. The ascent of republicanism to the {{political}} mainstream started only {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, facilitated by the toppling of various European monarchies through <b>war</b> <b>or</b> revolution; as at the beginning of the 21st century, most of the states in Europe are republics with either a directly or indirectly elected head of state.|$|E
5|$|Conroy {{was born}} on 21 October 1786 in Maes-y-castell, Caerhun, Caernarvonshire, Wales. He was one of six {{children}} born to John Ponsonby Conroy, Esq. and Margaret Wilson, both native to Ireland. His father was a barrister and the younger Conroy was privately educated in Dublin. On 8 September 1803, he was commissioned in the Royal Artillery as a Second Lieutenant and was promoted to First Lieutenant on 12 September. In 1805, Conroy enrolled in the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich. He made his career during the Napoleonic Wars, though his ability to avoid battle attracted disdain from other officers. Conroy {{did not participate in}} the Peninsular <b>War</b> <b>or</b> the Waterloo Campaign.|$|E
5|$|Despite Brown's intentions, Saban {{was used}} {{occasionally}} on the Browns' offense in 1946.

He was mainly used as a linebacker, however, and had four interceptions as the Browns won the first AAFC championship. In the offseason, he worked for Browns owner Mickey McBride's Yellow Cab Company; many of his teammates spent the offseason either at college making up for time lost to the <b>war</b> <b>or</b> taking jobs to supplement their football incomes.|$|E

5|$|Despite some {{immediate}} confiscations {{after the}} siege, {{by the time}} of the Restoration of Charles II, the Somerset family had managed to recover most of their possessions, including Raglan Castle.

5|$|During the Early Modern {{period of}} Swiss history, the growing {{authoritarianism}} of the patriciate families {{combined with a}} financial crisis {{in the wake of}} the Thirty Years' War led to the Swiss peasant war of 1653. In the background to this struggle, the conflict between Catholic and Protestant cantons persisted, erupting in further violence at the First War of Villmergen, in 1656, and the Toggenburg <b>War</b> (<b>or</b> Second War of Villmergen), in 1712.|$|E
5|$|Famine {{is shaped}} by {{generally}} two theories. The first is FAD, Food Availability Decline. This {{is the result of}} a drought, a <b>war,</b> <b>or</b> some other drastic change to the agricultural system. This is the natural cause for famine. The other theory deals primarily with the population’s ability to access or become entitled to food. In this case, food power makes itself known on a small scale, as opposing political forces in Sudan compete for the votes of the people by instigating or encouraging the famine.|$|E

Its duties as a customs unit meant that the unit was garrisoned in Germany for over forty years from 1950 until 1990, never seeing action in the American operations in the Korean War, Vietnam <b>War,</b> <b>or</b> the Persian Gulf War. It was deactivated during the post-Cold War drawdown of the U.S. military.|$|E
5|$|He spent £58,000 on {{his royal}} castles, {{carrying}} out major {{works at the}} Tower of London, Lincoln and Dover. Both the military defences and the internal accommodation of these castles were significantly improved. At Windsor, a huge overhaul of the castle produced a lavish palace complex, whose style and detail inspired many subsequent designs in England and Wales. The Tower of London was extended to form a concentric fortress with extensive living quarters, although Henry primarily used the castle as a secure retreat {{in the event of}} <b>war</b> <b>or</b> civil strife. Henry also kept a menagerie at the Tower, a tradition begun by his father, and his exotic specimens included an elephant, a leopard and a camel.|$|E
5|$|In case of <b>war</b> <b>or</b> {{national}} emergency, the Naval Staff was {{to become}} directly subordinate to the Supreme Command. The Naval Staff would command the fleet, river flotilla, Maritime Air Force and Naval Coastal Command. All other naval establishments would remain {{under the control of}} the Navy Section of the Ministry of Army and Navy. There were a few exceptions to these general arrangements. For example, the naval detachments on Lake Ohrid and Lake Scutari were subordinated to the local army districts, and the Naval Coastal Command was subordinated to the Royal Yugoslav Army's Coastal Defence Command. In case of mobilisation, the navy would need to requisition about 250 sea-going and 25 river vessels.|$|E
5000|$|In European {{military}} tradition, {{military units}} may be acknowledged for their achievements in specific <b>wars</b> <b>or</b> operations {{of a military}} campaign. In Great Britain and those countries of the Commonwealth which share a common military legacy with the British, battle honours are awarded to selected military units as official acknowledgement for their achievements in specific <b>wars</b> <b>or</b> operations of a military campaign.
