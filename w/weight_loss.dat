5|$|The main {{treatment}} for obesity consists of dieting and physical exercise.

5|$|The most {{effective}} treatment for obesity is bariatric surgery. The types of procedures include laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, vertical-sleeve gastrectomy, and biliopancreatic diversion. Surgery for severe obesity {{is associated with}} long-term <b>weight</b> <b>loss,</b> improvement in obesity related conditions, and decreased overall mortality. One study found a <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> of between 14% and 25% (depending {{on the type of}} procedure performed) at 10years, and a 29% reduction in all cause mortality when compared to standard <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> measures. Complications occur in about 17% of cases and reoperation is needed in 7% of cases. Due to its cost and risks, researchers are searching for other effective yet less invasive treatments including devices that occupy space in the stomach.|$|E

Finally, the cycle is affected more by a vegetarian diet compared to a non-vegetarian diet.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion, {{when used}} for {{treating}} obesity {{over a period}} of 6 to 12 months, may result in <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> of 2.7kg over placebo. This is not much different from the <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> produced by several other medications, such as sibutramine or orlistat. It has been studied in combination with naltrexone.

5|$|In 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration {{approved}} the drug exenatide (marketed as Byetta) {{for the management}} of type 2 diabetes. It is a synthetic version of a protein, exendin-4, derived from the Gila monster's saliva. In a three-year study with people with type 2 diabetes, exenatide led to healthy sustained glucose levels and progressive <b>weight</b> <b>loss.</b> The effectiveness is because the lizard protein is about 50% identical to glucagon-like peptide-1 analog (GLP-1), a hormone released from the human digestive tract that helps to regulate insulin and glucagon. The lizard protein remains effective much longer than the human hormone, helping diabetics keep their blood sugar levels under control. Exenatide slows the emptying of the stomach and causes a decrease in appetite, contributing to <b>weight</b> <b>loss.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{people with}} stable OHS, the most {{important}} treatment is weight loss—by diet, through exercise, with medication, or sometimes <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> surgery (bariatric surgery). This {{has been shown to}} improve the symptoms of OHS and resolution of the high carbon dioxide levels. <b>Weight</b> <b>loss</b> may take a long time and is not always successful. Bariatric surgery is avoided if possible, given the high rate of complications, but may be considered if other treatment modalities are ineffective in improving oxygen levels and symptoms. If the symptoms are significant, nighttime positive airway pressure (PAP) treatment is tried; this involves the use of a machine to assist with breathing. PAP exists in various forms, and the ideal strategy is uncertain. Some medications have been tried to stimulate breathing or correct underlying abnormalities; their benefit is again uncertain.|$|E

30|$|In the {{temperature}} range of 208 – 262  °C, all nanocomposites show <b>weight</b> <b>losses,</b> which {{are higher than}} LSA contents but significantly less than <b>weight</b> <b>losses</b> of PS (Fig. 4, curves 1, 4, and 5, Table 2). However, {{in the case of}} NC 2 and NC 3, these losses are even higher than contents of PANI-LSA. Based on the high thermal stability of PANI base [39] and thermal behavior of the PS nanoparticles (Fig. 4, curve 1), we probably may assign the nanocomposite losses not only to evaporation and degradation of the dopant but also to degradation of the PS component. Moreover, whereas <b>weight</b> <b>losses</b> of NC 2 and NC 3 at 262  °C (Table 2) exceed sums of their LSA contents and PS loss (3.02 and 3.7, respectively), one may assume that some enhancement of the thermooxidative degradation of the PS core component of the nanocomposites can be caused by degradation products of the dopant.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of polymeric computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing CAD/CAM materials on antagonistic primary tooth wear. Five CAD/CAM polymeric materials were examined: Vipi Block Monocolor (VBM), Yamahachi polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) (YAP), Mazic Duro (MZD), Vita Enamic (ENA), and Pekkton (PEK). All of the specimens were tested in a thermomechanical loading machine with the primary canine as the antagonist (50 N, 1. 2 × 105 cycles, 1. 7 Hz, 5 / 55 °C). The wear losses of the antagonist tooth and the restorative materials were calculated using reverse modelling software and an electronic scale.

PEK showed the largest value in both material volumetric and <b>weight</b> <b>losses.</b> In terms of material volumetric losses, there was no significant difference between all of the groups (p > 0. 05). In terms of material <b>weight</b> <b>losses,</b> PEK was significantly larger than ENA (p 0. 05). Volumetric and <b>weight</b> <b>losses</b> of materials showed similar wear behaviour.
