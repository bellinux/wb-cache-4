The fact that Paramount Pictures donated a mere $27,000 to Rebuild L.A. should not be a passport to exploit women in Los Angeles." [...] Protestors picketed the unveiling of the altered sign. The promotional campaign was focused on the sex appeal of Holli. It was considered by some experts as misaimed, with Paramount's marketing president Barry London saying [...] "Cool World unfortunately did not seem to satisfy the younger audience it was aimed at," [...] and designer Milton Knight recalling that [...] "Audiences actually wanted a wilder, raunchier Cool World.

500|$|Journalists and pundits {{reviewing}} the final praised Liverpool's tenacity; radio commentator Alan Green {{wrote in his}} News Letter column of 14 May 2001: [...] "Simply, they never give up {{and when you have}} a player like Michael Owen <b>within</b> <b>your</b> ranks you believe that any situation can be rescued, {{as it was in the}} magnificent Millennium Stadium." [...] The Guardian correspondent David Lacey declared [...] "The Owen of France '98 was reborn in Cardiff," [...] while Hugh McIlvanney of The Sunday Times called Owen [...] "the master executioner of English football." [...] McIlvanney felt over the 90 minutes the Arsenal team were [...] "unlucky to lose," [...] lauding Vieira's show in midfield. James Lawton's match report in The Independent was not as empathetic; although in praise of Henry's performance his indecision compared to Owen, demonstrated how [...] "effect, not style, is everything" [...] in football. Clive White of The Herald criticised Henry's lack of end product, using the final and Arsenal's European failure against Valencia to demonstrate how he would never be considered a [...] "natural goalscorer". Ron Atkinson, writing in his tactics column for The Guardian noted Liverpool's winning goal only came about because of Arsenal's eagerness to attack, which left gaps in defence.|$|E

[...] Although Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave the song three out of five stars, complimenting production by Danja, and saying that the song sounded like a more obvious hit than [...] "Return the Favor", he complained that [...] "getting two R A-listers to appear on your track should be a real coup, but not when one's got a more distinctive voice than you and the other steals the show with some typically ballsy rapping." [...] Quentin B. Huff of PopMatters criticized the repetitive hook, stating [...] "Hook-wise, it’s a little like listening to an album of kids chanting while playing double-dutch."
