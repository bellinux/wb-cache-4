40|$|This {{background}} document for {{the revision}} of the criteria for EU Ecolabel for WOOD, CORK AND BAMBOO BASED FLOOR COVERINGS is meant to provide the final rationale {{for each of the}} voted EU Ecolabel criteria. Each criteria rationale includes the results of stakeholder surveys, market analysis and known concerns with existing criteria, including changes in hazardous substance classification of commonly used ingredients. As policy-relevant recommendations, it points out where there is scope for strengthening the EU Ecolabel and which criteria could be removed, amended or further developed. The information contained in this document provides an overview of changes to the WOOD, CORK AND BAMBOO BASED FLOOR COVERINGS market since the adoption of the first EU Ecolabel criteria set for <b>Wooden</b> <b>floor</b> <b>coverings,</b> and a technical analysis to understand where the greatest environmental impacts arise in their life cycle.

40|$|The EU is {{responsible}} for around 20 % of global furniture production and the many "ecolabel schemes" of potential relevance to furniture products have been briefly reviewed. Screening of 109 publications relating to the life cycle impacts of furniture products revealed several general trends, namely that material production and processing where the dominant sources of environmental impacts associated with furniture products. A comprehensive review {{of the use of}} hazardous substances and mixtures in furniture production has also been carried out, particularly {{in the context of the}} REACH and CLP Regulations. The work presented in this report will form the basis for initial discussions and criteria proposals during the revision process for EU Ecolabel and EU GPP criteria for furniture. The revision process will eventually result in the publication of two final Technical Reports, one for EU Ecolabel criteria and one for EU GPP criteria. The final EU Ecolabel criteria will be officially published as a Commission Decision and translated in all Member State languages. The revision process will be closely related to ongoing work by the JRC for the revision of several other EU Ecolabel product groups such as Textiles, Mattresses, <b>Wooden</b> <b>Floor</b> <b>Coverings</b> and Footwear, due to common materials involved.

40|$|In {{the recent}} past, {{multi-storey}} wooden buildings are increasingly built in many European countries. Since years {{it is known}} that especially in wooden buildings the correlation between the standardized measuring and evaluation methods using the tapping machine and the human perception of impact noise can be poor. For <b>wooden</b> <b>floor</b> constructions it is rather difficult to fulfill given requirements. But even when they are met, low frequency transmission is still a main cause of complaints. In the AcuWood project measurements and recordings on different <b>wooden</b> <b>floor</b> constructions and one concrete floor, equipped with different <b>floor</b> <b>coverings,</b> were performed. Additionally to the standardized tapping machine, other technical impact sources as well as “real” sources were employed. On this database listening tests with subjective ratings of the signals were correlated to many single number descriptors, including standardized and non-standardized proposals. The analysis of the data gives answers to the questions which technical impact noise source is most appropriate to represent walking noise and which single number rating system is a good predictor for annoyance. Additionally, the data can be used to evaluate given requirements in terms of percentage of annoyed persons for the suggested single number ratings...|$|R

40|$|In March 2002, the Swedish Work Environment Authority {{performed}} an inspection at Skottsundsbackens home for elderly in the municipality of Sundsvall. The Swedish Work Environment Authority {{came to the}} conclusion that the ergonomic problems many employees had experienced were related to the <b>floor</b> <b>covering</b> in the building. The municipality lodged an appeal, but in October 2005 the appeal was rejected by the Supreme Administrative Court of Sweden. In the decision you can read that “The Swedish Work Environment Authority points out that if the <b>floor</b> <b>covering</b> has got a suitable springiness or not can not be objectively judged, since there are no test methods for this”. In spite of this, the Swedish Work Environment Authority believes that the best way to minimise the risks of strain injuries is to replace the current <b>floor</b> <b>covering</b> with a softer <b>floor</b> <b>covering.</b> Since there are existing test methods to quantify properties of springiness (i. e. shock absorption and vertical deformation) for sport surfaces, the aim of this study has been to find out whether these methods can be applied to ordinary <b>floor</b> <b>coverings.</b> If it’s possible, this might be a way of objectively judge if a <b>floor</b> <b>covering</b> is suitable or not for a certain work activity. The test methods chosen were EN 14808 Surfaces for sports areas – Determination of shock absorption and EN 14809 Surfaces for sport areas – Determination of vertical deformation. The study could also bee seen as an inventory of what values that could be expected for ordinary <b>floor</b> <b>coverings</b> in Sweden. Another goal for the study was to find out whether or not it was possible to quantify the difference between the <b>floor</b> <b>covering</b> that was replaced at Skottsundsbacken and the softer one that was finally installed. The conclusions of the study were that the mentioned test methods are suitable for measuring mechanical comfort properties of <b>floor</b> <b>coverings,</b> exceptions made for homogeneous and heterogeneous <b>floor</b> <b>coverings</b> without any kind of foam backing. These floorings has got very little ability to absorb energy and the results from the measurements can not be used to discriminate between them.

Differences were studied between babies remaining still, babies crawling on tiling, <b>wooden</b> <b>floors</b> or rubber foam groundsheets and older walking children. The results suggest that an air temperature of 22 degrees C leads to skin temperatures comparable to those observed for resting adults in comfort, while 20 degrees C seems to induce a slight but overall cooling of the body and considerable cooling of the extremities for the babies remaining still. The material of <b>floor</b> <b>coverings</b> should be considered carefully and preference given to low conductivity materials. Assuming that the optimum skin temperatures are the same for children amd for adults, it appears that the PMV-PPD approach can be used to predict this particular optimum comfort condition, provided an increase of 20 wm(- 2) is taken into account for the metabolic rate of the small children...|$|R
