5|$|After Ueshiba left Hokkaidō in 1919, he met and {{was profoundly}} {{influenced}} by Onisaburo Deguchi, the {{spiritual leader of}} the Ōmoto-kyō religion (a neo-Shinto movement) in Ayabe. One of the primary features of Ōmoto-kyō is its emphasis on the attainment of utopia during one's life. This was a great influence on Ueshiba's martial arts philosophy of extending love and compassion especially to those <b>who</b> <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> harm others. Aikido demonstrates this philosophy in its emphasis on mastering martial arts so that one may receive an attack and harmlessly redirect it. In an ideal resolution, {{not only is the}} receiver unharmed, but so is the attacker.|$|E

Shiva then declares a holy war on those <b>who</b> <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> continue to use it, mainly the Emperors Daksha and Dilipa, who are being controlled by the sage Bhrigu. The battle rages on and Shiva travels {{to the land of}} Pariha to consult with Vayuputras, a legendary tribe. By the time he returns, the war has ended with Sati, his wife, being murdered.

5|$|The book's {{central theme}} {{is a warning}} that, in times of strife and {{increased}} fear, {{there is a danger}} of repression and suppression of dissent by those in government <b>who</b> <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> limit freedom of speech. In an interview with the author, Deborah Solomon of The New York Times Magazine wrote that American politics has frequently used fear to justify repression. Lewis pointed out to Solomon that, under the Espionage Act of 1917 and the Sedition Act of 1918, individuals who protested against President Woodrow Wilson's sending of soldiers to Russia were tried and given a twenty-year jail sentence. The author explained that his motivation for writing the book was to recognize the unparalleled civil liberties in the U.S., including freedom of speech and freedom of the press. He identified reductions in freedoms of citizens as a result of governmental action taken after the September 11 attacks.|$|E

5|$|Thrasher and Blastus are {{two teenage}} robots {{who live on}} the planet of Insanus. Their planet is {{inhabited}} by murderous robots <b>who</b> <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> kill one another for no apparent reason. Slightly less horrific than their peers, the duo seek to make it through high school, and navigate their lives with mixed results. Thrasher (Patton Oswalt), a tall and lanky robot, wishes to gain the affections of an attractive female robot named Maimy (Jessie Cantrell). Meanwhile, Blastus (John Gemberling), a small and rotund robot, just wants to be popular. As with Blastus, unlike most robots on Insanus, he is mostly sensitive and non-criminal, much to the disapproval of his mother. In his quest to be cool, however, he is incredibly impulsive and overconfident in his abilities. Thrasher, though calm and reserved, often falls prey to Blastus' badly-thought out plans.|$|E
5|$|Bravely Default {{is set in}} {{the world}} of Luxendarc, which is kept in balance by four {{elemental}} crystals. These crystals are protected and venerated by the Crystal Orthodoxy, a worldwide religious order. One day, the crystals are consumed by darkness, throwing the world into chaos. Agnès Oblige, Vestal of the Wind Crystal, escapes {{while the rest of the}} temple's worshipers perish to protect her. At the same time, a great chasm opens up beneath the village of Norende; Tiz Arrior, a shepherd of the village, is the only survivor. When he returns to the chasm hoping to find other survivors, he meets Agnès and her fairy companion Airy. The three are then attacked by forces from the hostile Duchy of Eternia, <b>who</b> <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> prevent Agnès from awakening the crystals. After defeating the soldiers, Tiz decides to travel with Agnès as her protector. They return to Caldisla, where they are also joined by Ringabel, an amnesiac vagabond who holds a book predicting future events, and Edea Lee, an Eternian soldier who becomes disillusioned and defects after her commanding officer commits war crimes. The party travels to the four temples, and Agnès awakens each of the crystals from darkness while being confronted by the forces of Eternia. During their journey, the group is aided by the ancient Sage Yulyana and observed by the immortal Lord DeRosso. The party eventually reaches Eternia, the home of the Earth Crystal, and are forced to defeat the leader of Eternia, Edea's father Braev Lee in battle. A column of light then appears in the chasm, which Airy says can be used to heal it. However, Airy's ritual instead sends them into a parallel world.|$|E
