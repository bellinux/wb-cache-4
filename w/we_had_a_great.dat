After the summer the band resumed {{recording}} the album at Rockfield Studios in South Wales– which had been used for the band's first two albums– and also at Amazon Studios in Liverpool. Recording the album was a slow process, de Freitas said, [...] "Porcupine {{was very hard to}} actually write and record [...] Heaven Up Here was pure confidence, we did it really quickly; <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> time doing it– but this one was like we had to drag it out of ourselves."

500|$|Julian Lennon {{discovered}} that [...] "Hey Jude" [...] {{had been written}} for him almost 20 years after McCartney composed the song. He recalled of his and McCartney's relationship: [...] "Paul and I used to hang about quite a bit – more than Dad and I did. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> friendship going {{and there seems to}} be far more pictures of me and Paul playing together at that age than there are pictures of me and my dad." [...] In 1996, Julian paid £25,000 for the recording notes to [...] "Hey Jude" [...] at an auction. He spent a further £35,000 at the auction, buying John Lennon memorabilia. John Cousins, Julian Lennon's manager, stated at the time: [...] "He has a few photographs of his father, but not very much else.

500|$|Needing to beat Inter Milan {{to win the}} Emirates Cup, Arsenal {{failed to}} take the {{initiative}} and went behind after 62 minutes. William Gallas' negligence to spot the incoming David Suazo meant the Inter striker was able to head the ball past goalkeeper Jens Lehmann. Arsenal regrouped quickly and scored five minutes later; a well-worked move between Eboué and Bacary Sagna set Hleb up to shoot, but his effort was saved by Toldo. The ball rebounded to the Arsenal midfielder, whose second shot went into the far corner. Near the end of normal time Robin van Persie scored a [...] "wonder goal" [...] to secure the win. Collecting a long pass from Eboué, the striker weaved past his opponent and dragged the ball back, before hitting it high into the far corner. Wenger said of Van Persie's winner: [...] "It was a great goal but I'm pleased <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> team performance.

500|$|Roth's fake trailer {{contained}} {{elements that}} almost earned Grindhouse an NC-17 rating, including a cheerleader simultaneously stripping, bouncing on a trampoline and getting {{stabbed in the}} vulva, and three decapitations; the first victim dressed as a pilgrim turkey at a parade gets decapitated and his headless body stumbles around in a exaggerated manner, the second occurs as the victim's girlfriend performs fellatio on him, and the last decapitation occurs on a man while he is being kissed by a female victim. According to Roth, [...] "Instead of seeing it spread out in a feature, watching it all jammed together non-stop makes it more shocking. But <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> discussion with the ratings board. They got it. Once they saw it with all the bad splices and the distress and scratches they were fine with it."

The album was co-produced by Lewis's boyfriend Johnathan Rice, former Beachwood Sparks and All Night Radio member Dave Scher, and Under the Blacklight producer Jason Lader.

[...] "We did it in the studio for my 32nd birthday," [...] according to Lewis, [...] "and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> time, collaborating with a bunch of friends.

I think they wrote a great script and he did a great job directing it, and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> supporting cast". Nutter said: [...] "The real great thing about 'Ice' is {{that we were able to}} convey a strong sense of paranoia. It was also a great ensemble piece. We're dealing with the most basic emotions of each character, ranging from their anger to their ignorance and fear. It established the emotional ties these two characters have with each other, which is very important. Scaring the hell out of the audience was definitely the key to the episode". Anderson said that [...] "it was very intense. There was a lot of fear and paranoia going on. We had some great actors to work with".|$|E

But the slaps were equally well dispatched." [...] Commenting on Reid's exit, Windsor has said, [...] "We fell out when I found out he was leaving because it was a shock for me. I was really upset. I've known him 30 odd years and I really like working with him. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> relationship as friends as well as performers.

During the following year they performed at various Australian festivals and at venues across the country.

2500|$|The group's first single, [...] "Maybe Tomorrow", {{produced}} by Visconti, was released worldwide on 15 November 1968. It reached the Top Ten in several European countries and Japan, but only number 67 on the US Billboard Hot 100, {{and failed to}} chart in the UK. The US manager of Apple Records, Ken Mansfield, ordered 400,000 copies of the single—considered to be a bold move {{at the time in}} the music business—and pushed for automatic airplay and reviews from newspapers, which he secured. Nevertheless, Mansfield remembered the problems: [...] "We had a great group. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> record. We were missing just one thing ... the ability to go out and pick up people, and convince them to put their money on the counter". A second Tom Evans composition, [...] "Storm in a Teacup", was included on an Apple EP promoting Wall's Ice Cream, along with songs by Apple artists such as [...] James Taylor, Mary Hopkin and Jackie Lomax. The chart success of [...] "Maybe Tomorrow" [...] in Europe and Japan led to a follow-up single release in those markets in July 1969: Griffiths' [...] "Dear Angie", also {{produced by}} Visconti. An LP containing both singles and titled Maybe Tomorrow was released only in Italy, Germany and Japan. This limited release strategy was thought to be the work of Apple Corps' president, Allen Klein; an Apple Corps' press officer, Tony Bramwell, remembered: [...] " [...] was saying, 'We're not going to issue any more records until I sort out this [...] mess.'" ...|$|E
