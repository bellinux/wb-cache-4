5|$|Antara was {{established}} on 13December 1937 in Batavia (later Jakarta), the colonial {{capital of the}} Dutch East Indies. Prior to its establishment, Dominique Willem Berretty had founded Aneta, the Indies' first news agency. A number of Dutch and indigenous firms <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>in</b> existence but did not achieve similar stature. As a Dutch agency, however, Aneta rarely included local news in its coverage. This led to dissatisfaction among independence activists Soemanang Soerjowinoto and Albert Manoempak Sipahoetar, who eventually decided to form a separate news agency.|$|E

5|$|Between 1893 and 1897, {{the years}} when Bauer and Nold <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>in</b> the Western Penitentiary for their part in the {{assassination}} attempt, the three men surreptitiously produced 60 issues of a hand-written anarchist newsletter by transferring their work from cell to cell. They managed to send the completed newsletters, which they called Prison Blossoms, to friends outside the prison. Participating in Prison Blossoms, initially written in German and later in English, helped Berkman improve his English. He developed a friendship with the prison chaplain, John Lynn Milligan, who was a strong advocate {{on behalf of the}} prison library. Milligan encouraged Berkman to read books from the library, a process that furthered his knowledge of English.|$|E

5|$|In 1914 the Cunard Steamship Company {{commissioned}} {{the construction of}} new headquarters for the company. Cunard's expansion had meant that they had outgrown their previous offices, which <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>in</b> Liverpool, and the site chosen for construction was at the former George's Dock, in between the Liver Building and Port of Liverpool Building. The building was designed by the architects William Edward Willink and Philip Coldwell Thicknesse and was inspired by the grand palaces of Renaissance Italy. It was constructed by Holland, Hannen & Cubitts between 1914 and 1917, with Arthur J. Davis, of Mewes and Davis, acting as consultant on the project.|$|E
5|$|On 26 April, Costa {{was chosen}} {{of one of}} two {{forwards}} for the season's PFA Team of the Year, alongside Tottenham's Harry Kane.

Due to injury, he was due to miss {{the remainder of the}} season, in which Chelsea won the league title with a 1–0 home win over Crystal Palace on 3 May. However, he featured in their last match of the season on the 24th, replacing the injured Didier Drogba after half an hour against Sunderland.

5|$|On 3 July 2002, English club Liverpool {{confirmed}} {{its interest}} in signing Diarra {{under the guidance}} of manager Gérard Houllier who had likened the player to Patrick Vieira. Liverpool <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>in</b> competition with Italian club Juventus and several French clubs. On 9 July, Liverpool confirmed that the club had signed the player from Bayern Munich. Diarra agreed to a five-year contract and made his club debut against Le Havre during the club's pre-season. A day after the match against Le Havre, it was reported that Diarra was on a verge of a loan move to the same club. On 1 August, the loan was confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before she}} turned 15, Falle met two child prostitutes who <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>in</b> their early teens. One {{of these girls}} was {{pregnant}} by her 42-year-old pimp. The two girls offered Falle {{a place to sleep}} at their apartment while their pimp was away; feeling there was no alternative, she accepted. Out of concern for Falle's safety, they taught her how to put a condom on a penis by practicing on a cucumber. These children effectively groomed Falle. She stayed at the apartment for several days, and she was watched by various men. By the time the pimp returned, Falle had moved on.|$|E
5|$|The Australians <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>in</b> need of {{rest and}} were {{suffering}} heavily from tropical diseases, which had inflicted more casualties than Japanese actions {{in this phase}} of the campaign. Nevertheless, after the fall of Wareo, fighting in the area continued. In order to enable the two main Japanese infantry regiments to make a clean break, the 2nd Battalion, 238th Infantry Regiment, carried out rearguard operations in the Wareo area until 15 December. On 8 December, shortly after the capture of Kwatingkoo, a company from the 2/24th Infantry Battalion was ambushed while moving towards Bazuluo; eight Australians were killed and another four wounded.|$|E

5|$|The Como celebration {{crossed the}} Atlantic in August 2002. Palena, Italy, {{the birthplace of}} Como's parents, had a long-standing week-long festival {{in honor of the}} singer. A smaller version of the statue was taken to Palena by the mayor of Canonsburg, Anthony Colaizzo. Perry's son, David, and his wife <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>in</b> {{attendance}} when the town of Palena renamed a street for Como. There is a marble plaque on a Palena town wall stating that Pietro and Lucia Como, parents of Perry Como, emigrated from this village to the United States which dates from these ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|The NK 6th Division shifted {{its axis}} of attack {{and its main}} attacking effort to the {{northern}} part of the Chinju-Masan corridor just below the Nam River in the 35th Infantry's sector. The 35th Infantry set to work to cover its front with trip flares, but they were in short supply and gradually it became impossible to replace them. Illuminating flares <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>in</b> short supply, and the reserve stocks had deteriorated to such a degree that only about 20 percent of the supply issued to the regiment was effective. Even when employed, the time lapse between a request for them and delivery by the big howitzers allowed some North Korean infiltration before the threatened area was illuminated.|$|E
5|$|The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) was an {{international}} organization for collective defense in Southeast Asia {{created by the}} Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty, or Manila Pact, signed in September 1954 in Manila, Philippines.

5|$|After Duquesne lost to Saint Bonaventure, the Bonnies {{also lost}} their final regular season game to Xavier, which left {{the two teams}} in a tie for the eighth seed and the home tournament game that went with it. The two teams had played each other twice during the season, with each team taking one victory, so the second tiebreaker came down to who had scored the best victory. Duquesne's best win came against Charlotte, while Saint Bonaventure's was against Rhode Island. Unfortunately, those two teams <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>in</b> a tie. So for Duquesne to get their home game, Charlotte had to win their final home game, and Rhode Island had to lose. Both teams lost, so the tie {{remained}} and Rhode Island won out due to their head-to-head records. Thus Duquesne would head {{back out on the}} road against the Bonnies.|$|E
5|$|At {{this point}} the {{fighting}} ceased for almost two weeks and during this time the 39th was joined by the 53rd and the 30th Brigade headquarters; and Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Honner arrived from Ilolo to take command. Reaching the battalion at Isurava on 16 August, he subsequently began organising the battalion's defence of Isurava. On 23 August Brigadier Arnold Potts took over command of Maroubra Force and further reinforcements arrived as first the 2/14th, 2/16th and later the 2/27th Battalions from the 7th Division's 21st Brigade also reached the area. Despite this, the situation remained bleak as the supply issue was becoming a serious problem for the Australians and the reinforcements that had arrived <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>in</b> a state of disarray having been committed to the battle in a piecemeal fashion and suffering badly from hunger and disease.|$|E
5|$|B'nai Israel was {{the only}} Jewish {{congregation}} in Memphis, and from {{the time it was}} established members were split between traditionalists and reformers. When remodeling their new building, the congregation voted eighteen to fourteen to maintain traditional separate seating for men and women. By 1858, with enough funds to hire a full-time spiritual leader, they consulted Rabbi Isaac Leeser, the leader of America's Orthodox Jewish community, but <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>in</b> contact with Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise, the leader of America's fledgling Reform movement, who had dedicated B'nai Israel's sanctuary earlier that year. The members had advertised for their first spiritual leader in Wise's newspaper, The Israelite (along with other English-language Jewish newspapers) {{at the same time they}} advertised for a kosher butcher. Leeser recommended Jacob J. Peres, an Orthodox rabbi.|$|E
