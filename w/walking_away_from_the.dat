She subsequently signed with New Zealand club Canterbury Flames for the 2007 National Bank Cup season, but withdrew her services before playing a game due to injury. She subsequently moved to England, where she currently plays mixed minor grade netball.|$|E

Then, the next scene passes through the band playing their instruments circling around and Chris Martin walking on the purple snow. At {{the end of the}} video, Martin falls to the snow and the final scene shows the band <b>walking</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> town. This video is shown on a small on-stage television screen at live shows, including the band's 2008 Viva la Vida tour.|$|E
5|$|Billie Burke {{objected to}} her role being cast with another actress (Myrna Loy) {{since she was}} also an actress under {{contract}} to the studio and could play herself, but the producers concluded that at that point {{she was not a}} big enough star to play herself in The Great Ziegfeld. However, according to Emily W. Leider, Burke was not keen on playing her younger self and says that Billie Burke's biographer stated that Miriam Hopkins would have been her first choice to play her part, not Loy. Burke herself worked as technical consultant, and although she did not object to Marilyn Miller performing a number, she was influential in the studio's refusal to give her the higher billing and salary she had demanded, which led to Miller <b>walking</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> film.|$|E

5|$|The Smiths {{saw the man}} {{at around}} 22:00 on Rua da Escola Primária, 500 yards (457 m) from the McCanns' apartment, <b>walking</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Ocean Club and toward Rua 25 de Abril and the beach. He was {{carrying}} a girl aged 3–4 years. She had blonde hair and pale skin, was wearing light-coloured pyjamas, and had bare feet. The man was mid-30s, 5ft 7in–5ft 9in (1.75–1.80 m), slim-to-normal build, with short brown hair, wearing cream or beige trousers. He {{did not look like}} a tourist, according to the Smiths, and had seemed uncomfortable carrying the child. E-fits based on the Smiths testimony were first created in 2008 by Oakley International, private investigators hired by the McCanns, and were publicized in 2013 by Scotland Yard on Crimewatch.|$|E
25|$|Multiplex {{also took}} the {{original}} steel contractor, Cleveland Bridge, {{to court to}} claim up to £38million compensation for costs resulting from Cleveland Bridge <b>walking</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> job. Cleveland Bridge, in turn, claimed up to £15million from Multiplex. The case was finally resolved in September 2008 with Cleveland Bridge ordered to pay £6.1million in damages and 20% of Multiplex's costs after the court found Cleveland Bridge {{was in the wrong}} to walk off site. The judge criticised both sides for allowing the case to reach court, pointing out that total costs were £22million, including £1million for photocopying. Multiplex's ultimate bill is estimated to be over £10million. In 2007, Multiplex also contested a claim from its concrete contractor, PC Harrington, that Multiplex owes £13.4million to PC Harrington.|$|E
25|$|Nine {{months after}} the murder of Tkachenko, on 12 June 1982, Chikatilo {{travelled}} by bus to the Bagayevsky District of Rostov to purchase vegetables. Having to change buses {{in the village of}} Donskoi, he decided to continue his journey on foot. <b>Walking</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bus station, he encountered a 13-year-old girl, named Lyubov Biryuk, who was herself walking home from a shopping trip. Once the path both were taking together was shielded from the view of potential witnesses by bushes, Chikatilo pounced upon Biryuk, dragged her into nearby undergrowth, tore off her dress, and killed her by stabbing and slashing her to death. When her body was found on 27 June, the medical examiner discovered evidence of 22 knife wounds inflicted to the head, neck, chest, and pelvic region. Further wounds found on the skull suggested the killer had attacked Biryuk from behind with the handle and blade of his knife. In addition, several striations were discovered upon Biryuk's eye sockets.|$|E

25|$|On July 15, 2013, Fantino was shuffled to the {{position}} of Minister of Veterans' Affairs. Several months later, the veterans ombudsman reported that the government provides veterans with insufficient compensation for pain and suffering and criticized the government, saying that some would be near poverty because of cuts to pensions and benefits. In the same year, the department announced the closure of eight local offices servicing veterans. In January 2014, Fantino arrived late for a meeting with veterans about the closures and engaged in an angry confrontation with one of the veterans, resulting in accusations that was is inept, rude and insensitive. In May, he was filmed ignoring and <b>walking</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> angry wife of a veteran as she asked questions of him. Fantino was criticized for his department's difficulties in delivering help and benefits to veterans and for spending $4 million on advertising to explain the government's position while allowing more than $1 billion allocated for benefits to lapse. On January 5, 2015, after months of controversy, Fantino was replaced by Erin O'Toole and demoted to {{the position}} of Associate Defence Minister.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Allen pulling up to a junkyard {{in a white}} pickup truck at night, with a watch hanging from his key chain. [...] Then, Allen takes a power cord {{out of the back}} of the truck and carries it through the junkyard until he plugs it in and flips a switch to turn on a large {{countdown}} clock.

The video was directed by Nigel Dick and features a guest appearance by Adam West as the judge of a court case. The video begins with Rae arriving {{at the scene of}} the case, surrounded by West and a group of female jurors who clap along to the song's melody. Presumably, Rae is trying to convict her ex-boyfriend of cheating on her. Various scenes include Rae performing at a school's gymnasium and picking a fight with a female antagonist named Chelsea. The video concludes with Rae winning the court case and <b>walking</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> scene.|$|E

500|$|Thomas {{called the}} scene in which Keith makes Veronica dinner [...] "quintessential Keith" [...] and {{indicative}} of his lasting commitment to his daughter. Despite knowing that the episode could be the series finale, Thomas did not want it to completely resolve all plot lines; his intention was to keep viewers guessing and prevent the conclusion from being too bland or typical. He ultimately felt that the final shot of Veronica <b>walking</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> voting booth in the rain was [...] "a pretty melancholy way to go out". The song [...] "It Never Rains in Southern California" [...] by Albert Hammond plays during the final scene. In promotional advertising for the episode, The CW billed it as a season finale, {{despite the fact that}} the series had already been cancelled.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Alive" [...] {{was directed by}} Jim Gable. The video opens with Lopez composing the melody and writing the lyrics for [...] "Alive" [...] on a piano in her living room, which overlooks a pier. Behind her, a flashing screen displays scenes from Enough, along with Lopez recording the song in a studio with her band. After <b>walking</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> piano, she lies optimistically on her sofa. She is then seen singing amid {{a large body of}} outdoor water. At the instrumental passage for [...] "Alive", Lopez embraces the music being played by the band and changes a few chords with Cory Rooney, who is seated at a piano. She then emotionally finishes recording the song during its final chorus. Throughout the entire video, clips from the film continue to be inter cut with these settings. The music video for [...] "Alive" [...] was included on a special edition DVD re-release of Enough, as well as Lopez's first music video compilation The Reel Me (2003). Lopez performed the song for the first and only time on The Oprah Winfrey Show on May 17, 2002.|$|E
500|$|During {{this period}} of {{commercial}} success, the extensive media attention and [...] "the stress of the grand tour" [...] began to affect Björk, as she repeatedly complained about the intrusiveness of tabloids and reporters. During the Asian leg of the Post Tour, Björk arrived at Bangkok International Airport with her son Sindri after a long haul flight; reporters were present, despite Björk's earlier request that the press leave her and her son alone until she held a press conference. While she was <b>walking</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> reporters, Julie Kaufman began to ask Sindri questions; this angered Björk, who lunged at Kaufman, knocking her to the ground. Björk's record company said that the reporter had been pestering her for four days. She later apologised to Kaufman, who declined to involve the police. The televised incident generated unwanted attention, as did the suicide of Björk's stalker Ricardo López, which caused a media sensation. On 12 September, López sent a letter bomb rigged with sulfuric acid to Björk's residence in London, returned home and filmed his suicide. After viewing his video diary, police contacted Scotland Yard, who intercepted the package without incident. To record in privacy away from the unwanted interest of the press, Björk's tour drummer Trevor Morais offered his studio in Málaga, Spain for Björk to record what would be Homogenic. Björk had begun the first sessions of the album in 1996, at her Maida Vale residence, {{after the completion of}} the extensive Post Tour gave her an urgent need to write new songs as a form of therapy.|$|E

In the calm air the flames rushed up on high, coloured pale brick-red, with violet gleams in the strong sunshine. The thin column of smoke ascended straight and unwavering till it lost itself in the clear blue of the sky, and, in the great empty space between the two houses the interested spectators could see the tall figure of the Tuan Putih, with bowed head and dragging feet, <b>walking</b> slowly <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fire towards the shelter of [...] "Almayer's Folly." ...|$|R
500|$|Les Bowie {{provided}} the special effects: {{he had made}} his name perfecting an improved technique for matte painting, called the delineating matte, and formed a company with Vic Margutti that specialised in matte effects. Bowie provided a number of matte paintings to enhance the scale of certain key shots in the film, including the crashed rocket, the Westminster Abbey set and the shot of Quatermass <b>walking</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Abbey at the climax of the movie. Partly because of the concerns raised by the BBFC and partly on account of the low budget, Val Guest kept the creature largely off-screen for much of the film, feeling that audiences' imaginations would fill in the blanks more effectively than he and the special effects team could deliver on-screen. For the climactic scenes at Westminster Abbey, however, Bowie created a monster from tripe and rubber and photographed it against a model of the Abbey. Sparks and fireworks were used for the shots of the creature being electrocuted. Michael Carreras felt something was missing when he viewed the first cut of this scene: he said, [...] "There was this great glob of something hanging about on the scaffolding. And they had put in the best music they could and put the best effects on it, but it meant nothing as far as I was concerned… absolutely nothing at all". An eye was added to the model of the monster and a human scream added to the soundtrack to give the creature some semblance of humanity in its final moments. Models were also used for the rocket blasting off in the final shot of the film.|$|E
500|$|The team {{breaks into}} TweenLit Inc.'s headquarters, {{planning}} {{to replace the}} new novel with their old version before the mass printing begins. However, when they reach the printing room, the book publishing executive shows up {{with a group of}} armed men. He reveals that someone tipped him off about their plan, just as Lisa appears letting them know it was her because she wants her name on a book that will actually be popular. The executive types in the password in the printing machine and gives Lisa the honor of inserting the USB flash drive with the novel on it. Later, when the saddened members of the group-writing team are <b>walking</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> headquarters, they pass a book store and discover that The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy is being put on the stands. Lisa shows up again, letting them know that she only pretended to betray them so that the publisher would type in the password. When Lisa gave Bart a hug, she replaced the executive's flash drive with Bart's flash drive that contained the troll novel. As a result, she was able to put the original version into print. Lisa is happy to know that her name is finally on a book; however, when she opens a copy, she discovers that Gaiman is listed as the author, not her. It turns out that there were three flash drives and that Gaiman heisted his way to the best-seller list [...] "once again" [...] despite being illiterate. During the credits, it is revealed that Moe was aware of Gaiman's scheme, and was in fact allied with him from the start. The two celebrate with a toast at Shelbyville Beach, but Gaiman double-crosses Moe and poisons his drink.|$|E

Police could not determine why the reliable children, already one hour late, were strolling alone and seemingly unconcerned. This was the last confirmed sighting of the children. It has been suggested that the postman was mistaken on the exact time he encountered the children, and that he actually met them before noon.|$|R

The next day, after being cautioned by a highway patrol over his driving, he checked into the La Mesa Motel in Santa Rosa, New Mexico. Later reports suggest he did not sleep there, and left his key inside the room, but bought vodka at the town store. He was seen the {{following}} day about 26 miles away, at a remote ranch owned by the Gennetti family. His car was later found abandoned at the ranch, and he was reportedly last seen <b>walking</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> it. <b>The</b> car contained Sullivan's money, papers, guitar, clothes, {{and a box of}} his unsold records.|$|R
50|$|The {{connection}} to ones motorcycle is sensed further, as Pirsig explained, by the frequent {{need to maintain}} its mechanical operation.

Similarly, motorcyclists experience pleasure at the feeling of being far more connected to their motor vehicles than in a motorcar, as being part of it rather than in it.|$|R
