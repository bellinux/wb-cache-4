5|$|Tech Tower is {{considered}} an iconic representation of Georgia Tech and {{of higher education in}} Atlanta. It is often featured in marketing materials and merchandise for the Institute and its silhouette is recognized throughout the Atlanta metropolitan area. The Tower, Georgia Tech's undergraduate research journal, is named after Tech Tower. Kessler Campanile, a stylized bell tower built on the Georgia Tech campus as part of an Institute-wide branding campaign in the mid-1990s, was designed to look like a modernized version of Tech Tower. The campanile is now featured in all Georgia Tech logos, though some have argued that Tech Tower itself <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> appropriate symbol.|$|E
5|$|The Windows {{version of}} Remastered {{was criticized for}} {{suffering}} {{from a number of}} technical issues in the multiplayer, with players also being dissatisfied with the game's available settings for PC. On Steam, it received mostly negative user reviews, with complaints including poor performance, a locked 90 frames per second, inadequate mouse support, numerous hackers, and a low player count. Some users suggested that the multiplayer of Modern Warfare <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> suitable alternative, which still attracted a sizable amount of players and offered better options for performance, modding and customization.|$|E

5|$|The {{college was}} {{established}} in 1871 by the English philanthropist Thomas Rhodes Armitage and the American anti-slavery campaigner Francis Joseph Campbell, who lost his sight as a young boy. Campbell had originally planned to establish a college for the blind in the United States, but was persuaded by Armitage that London <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> suitable location. At the time, English schools for the blind did not provide their students with the skills to become independent and, dissatisfied with this situation, Armitage dreamed of establishing a school whose emphasis was on music and which would prepare its students for careers as organists, piano tuners, and music teachers.|$|E
5|$|In {{view of the}} board's lack of urgency, C {{took nearly}} a year to {{research}} this project. The proposed main battery of eight 14-inch guns was kept constant while other factors were calculated—speeds of 26, 29 and 32 knots; operating ranges of 5000, 7000 and 8000 miles; and belt armor of 8, 11 and 14 inches. On 12 July 1912, Naval Constructor R.H. Robinson presented these studies at a lecture he gave at the Naval War College with the General Board in attendance. There, he emphasized 8 inches as an absolute minimum for armor protection and recommended a radius of 8000 miles, {{the same as in}} U.S. battleships. The General Board's reaction was to request two battlecruisers for the 1914 Naval Building Program and ask C for a slightly modified version of the proposed ship, but the Naval War College felt the design had serious problems and that a fast battleship <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> practical option.|$|E
5|$|Kosara then {{begged her}} father for Vladimir's hand, and the tsar granted her request. He {{restored}} his new son-in-law {{to the throne}} of Duklja. In reality, the marriage was probably a result of Samuel's political assessment: he may have decided that Vladimir <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> loyal vassal if {{he was married to}} his daughter. Resolving thus the question of Duklja, Samuel could concentrate more troops in Macedonia and Thessaly, the main site of his conflict with Byzantium. The chronicle claims that the tsar also gave Vladimir the whole territory of Dyrrachium. The prince could in fact have been given a northern part of that territory, which was partially under Samuel's rule. A brief note on Vladimir by John Skylitzes may indicate that the prince also received some territory in Raška. His paternal uncle Dragimir, ruler of Travunia and Zachlumia, who had retreated before Samuel's army, was given back his lands to rule, also as the tsar's vassal.|$|E

5|$|The heating {{mechanism}} {{required for}} the formation of the grooved terrain on Ganymede is an unsolved problem in the planetary sciences. The modern view is that the grooved terrain is mainly tectonic in nature. Cryovolcanism is thought to have played only a minor role, if any. The forces that caused the strong stresses in the Ganymedian ice lithosphere necessary to initiate the tectonic activity may be connected to the tidal heating events in the past, possibly caused when the satellite passed through unstable orbital resonances. The tidal flexing of the ice may have heated the interior and strained the lithosphere, leading to the development of cracks and horst and graben faulting, which erased the old, dark terrain on 70% of the surface. The formation of the grooved terrain may also be connected with the early core formation and subsequent tidal heating of Ganymede's interior, which may have caused a slight expansion of Ganymede by 1–6 % due to phase transitions in ice and thermal expansion. During subsequent evolution deep, hot water plumes may have risen from the core to the surface, leading to the tectonic deformation of the lithosphere. Radiogenic heating within the satellite is the most relevant current heat source, contributing, for instance, to ocean depth. Research models have found that if the orbital eccentricity were an order of magnitude greater than currently (as it may have been in the past), tidal heating <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> substantial heat source than radiogenic heating.|$|E
25|$|In finance, in {{particular}} the Black–Scholes model, changes in the logarithm of exchange rates, price indices, and stock market indices are assumed normal (these variables behave like compound interest, not like simple interest, and so are multiplicative). Some mathematicians such as Benoit Mandelbrot have argued that log-Levy distributions, which possesses heavy tails <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> appropriate model, {{in particular}} for the analysis for stock market crashes. The use of the assumption of normal distribution occurring in financial models has also been criticized by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his works.|$|E
25|$|One {{objection}} {{that has}} been made to this theory is that it is too complex. While it accounts for many possible sentences, it also requires introducing new rules and constraints, and treats bound variable pronouns differently from other types of pronouns. Proponents of this objection, such as linguist Tanya Reinhart, argue that the difference between bound variable pronouns and pronouns of other kinds should be a semantic rather than a syntactic difference. They propose that a syntactic theory that requires less rules <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> preferable theory.|$|E

Planning started in August 1940 and Mandal remained in use until April 1941. It was then closed down and operations moved to Lista Air Station. A further expansion of Mandal took place in 1944, with more taxiways and aircraft stands, although these were never used. No squadrons were ever stationed at Mandal and it was closed {{at the end of}} the war in 1945.|$|E
25|$|For Kelly Kapowski, {{the love}} {{interest}} of both Zack and Slater, producers {{were able to}} narrow the field down to three actresses: Tiffani-Amber Thiessen, Elizabeth Berkley, and Jennie Garth. Engel had originally met Thiessen in 1988 while casting for Good Morning, Miss Bliss and was impressed with how much her acting had improved. He wanted her for the role, believing she had the perfect all-American girl appeal for the role, while others felt that Berkley, as the more experienced actress, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> reliable choice. Ultimately, Engel convinced the others after a read-through with Lopez, and Thiessen received the role.|$|E
25|$|Another {{low point}} in Ribbentrop's {{relations}} with the SS occurred in February 1943, when the SD backed a Luther-led internal putsch to oust Ribbentrop as foreign minister. Luther had become estranged from Ribbentrop because Frau Ribbentrop treated Luther as a household servant. She pushed her husband into ordering an investigation into allegations of corruption on Luther's part. Luther's putsch failed largely because Himmler decided that a foreign ministry headed by Luther <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> dangerous opponent than the Ribbentrop version. At the last minute, he withdrew his support from Luther. In {{the aftermath of the}} putsch, Luther was sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp.|$|E

He added, however, that design procedures of the Corps may not account for changes in soil strength caused by the changes in water flow and pressure during a hurricane flood. Dr. Bea has also questioned the size of the design safety margins. He said the corps applied a 30%margin over the maximum design load. A doubling of strength <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> typical margin for highway bridges, dams, off-shore oil platforms and other public structures.

Polls even showed that Riordan would defeat Davis. Davis attacked Riordian with negative ads in the primary. The ads questioned Riordan's pro-choice stance by questioning Riordan's support of pro-life politicians and judges. The ads pointed out Riordan's position of wanting a moratorium on the death penalty as being to the left of Gray Davis, who strongly supported it.|$|E

This led the EBU to create what was hoped <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> permanent solution to the problem. A qualification round, known as the semi-final, was introduced for the 2004 Contest. This semi-final was held on the Wednesday during Eurovision Week, and was a programme similar in format to the grand final, whose time slot remained 19:00 UTC on the Saturday. The highest-placed songs from the semi-final qualified for the grand final, while the lower-placed songs were eliminated. From 2005 to 2007, the semi-final programme was held on the Thursday of Eurovision Week. In these two shows there was enough time to include all the countries who wished to participate.|$|E
25|$|In February the British {{government}} {{planned to}} send 1,100 reinforcements by mid-May but financial wrangling between the War Office and the Colonial Office delayed {{the arrival of}} an infantry battalion until 15 May and a second battalion until 12 July. The French in Djibouti were asked to block the Jirreh and Dobo passes but the British strategy was to hope that the effort of invading British Somaliland would act as a deterrent and that Djibouti <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> tempting target. When the French in French Somaliland rallied to Vichy after the French armistice of 22 June 1940 with Germany, The Officer Commanding, Troops in British Somaliland, Brigadier Arthur Reginald Chater RM, was ordered to make a contingency plan for an evacuation if the colony became untenable. By August, the garrison consisted of the 1st Battalion Northern Rhodesia Regiment (1st NRR), the 2nd (Nyasaland) Battalion KAR, the 1st East African Light Battery (4 × 3.7-inch howitzers) from Kenya, the 1st Battalion 2nd Punjab Regiment and the 3rd Battalion 15th Punjab Regiment from the Colony of Aden and the lightly armed Somaliland Camel Corps (SCC) including 37 officer and NCO reinforcements from the Southern Rhodesia Regiment. On 8 August the 2nd Battalion Black Watch arrived. The garrison was a motley group with no proper base or headquarters and was short of artillery, transport and signalling equipment. Aircraft had to fly from Aden while also busy with convoy patrols and air defence. Two anti-aircraft guns were sent over from Aden {{but that was the}} most that could be spared.|$|E
