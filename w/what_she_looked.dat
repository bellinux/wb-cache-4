25|$|The film {{features}} two {{allusions to}} Alfred Hitchcock's film Vertigo. Like that film, it features recurring images of spirals, {{such as the}} 'Spirale' Cafe behind Manni's phone box and the spiral staircase down which Lola runs. In addition, the painting on {{the back wall of}} the casino of a woman's head seen from behind is based on a shot in Vertigo: Tykwer disliked the empty space on the wall behind the roulette table and commissioned production designer Alexander Manasse to paint a picture of Kim Novak as she appeared in Vertigo. Manasse could not remember <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> like in the film; therefore, he decided to paint the famous shot of the back of her head. The painting took fifteen minutes to complete. The bed sheets in the red scenes also feature spiral designs which add to the allusion.|$|E
500|$|According to {{producer}} Don Hahn, Beaumont's Belle is an [...] "incredibly passive" [...] character, {{the personality}} of whom he likened to those of Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella, as well as American actress and animal rights activist Doris Day, describing them as women who are [...] "capable, but filling a role that women might fill in the 1950s and 1960s.” The filmmakers painstakingly reworked Belle into a more three-dimensional character by providing her with goals and aspirations beyond romance and marriage, while expanding her passive role into that of a more inquisitive heroine. Determined to have Belle resemble [...] "an unusual Disney heroine," [...] Woolverton deliberately molded her into an independent character {{who is not a}} princess, enjoys books and has little interest in marriage, and worked closely with Ashman to create a proactive heroine [...] "who was a thinker and a reader and she wasn’t about <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> like and she wasn’t a victim." [...] Although Belle being well-read is mentioned in the original fairy tale, it is hardly important to its plot. Thus, Belle's passion for reading was vastly expanded upon, borrowing from both the Little Woman character Jo March and Woolverton's own love of reading to further demonstrate the character's intelligence and open mind. Both Woolverton and O'Hara encouraged the filmmakers to emphasize the intelligent and book-loving aspects of Belle's personality. However, at times the animators struggled to fulfill Woolverton's vision. Originally, Belle was depicted constantly crying throughout her imprisonment; Woolverton resented this, arguing that the character was {{much more likely to be}} either searching for an escape or simply [...] "be intrigued that she was living in an enchanted castle" [...] than crying. [...] "Once everybody realized she wasn’t going to be this typical Disney female, they would go to the extreme ... She became bitchy"; the screenwriter argued that Belle would be [...] "too smart" [...] to act this way. A few years older than The Little Mermaids Ariel, Belles' love of reading makes the character more worldly and mature than her predecessor. Belle is believed by Henn to be [...] "probably" [...] the oldest of Disney's princesses, at 20 years of age.|$|E
2500|$|Wanrong wore a mask in {{accordance}} with Chinese tradition and Puyi, who knew nothing of women, remembered: [...] "I hardly thought about marriage and family. It was only when the Empress came into my field of vision with a crimson satin cloth embroidered with a dragon and a phoenix over her head that I felt at all curious about <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> like." [...] After the wedding was complete, Puyi, Wanrong, and his secondary consort Wenxiu (whom he married the same night) went to the Palace of Earthly Tranquility, where everything was red [...] the color of love and sex in China [...] and where emperors had traditionally consummated their marriages. Puyi, who was sexually inexperienced and timid, fled from the bridal chamber, leaving his wives {{to sleep in the}} Dragon Bed by themselves. About Puyi's failure to consummate his marriage on his wedding night, Behr wrote:It was perhaps too much to expect an adolescent, permanently surrounded by eunuchs to show the sexual maturity of a normal seventeen year-old. Neither the Dowager consorts nor Johnston himself had given him any advice on sexual matters [...] this sort of thing simply was not done, where emperors were concerned: It would have been an appalling breach of protocol. But the fact remains that a totally inexperienced, over-sheltered adolescent, if normal, could hardly have failed to be aroused by Wan Jung's [...] unusual, sensual beauty. The inference is, of course, that Pu Yi was either impotent, extraordinarily immature sexually, or already aware of his homosexual tendencies.|$|E
5000|$|Nobody Knows My Face! - Millie Mason is {{a budding}} actress with dreams of {{becoming}} a star. It seems she’s {{on her way to}} fame when she gets spotted by an agent, Eddie Tanner. Unfortunately every role she gets cast in she ends up in a costume, mask or in the shadows, so nobody sees <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> like. Her agent also thinks keeping the mystery of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> like will make her an even bigger star, with a big reveal.|$|R

5000|$|In [...] "Den of Thieves", Beckett meets robbery detective Tom Demming (Michael Trucco), to {{whom she}} {{instantly}} takes a liking. It is later revealed that the two have started dating, eating together at work, and even sharing a cab. At the end of [...] "Overkill", she shares a kiss with him, confirming {{that they are now}} in a relationship. However, in the season 2 finale, Beckett breaks off the relationship, claiming that it [...] "isn't <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> <b>looking</b> for right now". Demming asks her <b>what</b> <b>she</b> is <b>looking</b> for and <b>she</b> merely <b>looks</b> away.|$|R
6000|$|... "How did {{you know}} I had it? If it hadn't been for her, I shouldn't have brought any. She put it into my pocket just as I was leaving. She said you would all want to see <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> like." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm rather glad of that, because I {{can imagine}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> like, without being {{hampered}} by facts. I {{think she was}} very slight and small, with softly curling dark hair and big, sweet, timid brown eyes, and a little wistful, pale face." ...|$|E
60|$|How I {{longed for}} more power, more words {{to tell her}} how {{infinitely}} more mercy there was than she thought of! I don't think she took it in then, but the beginning was made, and she turned away no more from <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> on at first {{as a means of}} bringing her to her boy, but by-and-by became even more to her.|$|E

6000|$|The {{marriage}} {{was to be}} at eleven o'clock, and, at nine, I went up to help Phillippa dress. She was no fussy bride, caring much <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> like. If Owen had been the bridegroom {{it would have been}} different. Nothing would have pleased her then; but now it was only just [...] "That will do very well, Aunt Rachel," [...] without even glancing at it.|$|E
60|$|Slowly, slowly, {{the light}} figure went round the great circle of gazers, ministering obediently to their pleasure, waiting patiently till their curiosity was satisfied. And now, her weary pilgrimage was well nigh {{over for the}} night. She {{had arrived at the}} last group of spectators who had yet to see <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> like close, and what tricks she could exhibit with her cards.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is a sad}} story," [...] {{said the}} Story Girl, [...] "and it {{happened}} fifty years ago, when Grandfather and Grandmother King were quite young. Grandmother's cousin Rachel Ward came to spend a winter with them. She belonged to Montreal and she was an orphan too, just like the Family Ghost. I have never heard <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> like, but she MUST have been beautiful, of course." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I don't," [...] insisted Hannah, [...] "that's a fact. I'll {{tell you}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> like in that hat and cloak--a bad woman.

60|$|Never {{before on}} a Sunday {{afternoon}} had Miss Drewitt known {{the streets of}} Binchester to be so full of people. She hurried on with bent head, looking straight before her, trying to imagine <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> like. There {{was no sign of}} the captain, but as they turned into Dialstone Lane they both saw a huge, shaggy, grey head protruding from the small window of his bedroom. It disappeared with a suddenness almost startling.|$|E
6000|$|She {{was greatly}} {{troubled by the}} fire, for she saw that it must efface all signs of the trail, and render the task of her friends long and difficult, and she felt greatly {{depressed}} at <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> upon as a certain postponement of her rescue. She lay thinking over all {{this for a long}} time, until the camp had subsided into perfect quiet. Then the skins were slightly lifted near her head, and she heard a voice whisper,-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'That's all right,' Dick stopped her. 'His {{work and}} habits {{have nothing to}} do with the matter. Now you are sure you have never {{encouraged}} Mr. Smith in any way?' And she was so sure that she talked for ten minutes, detailing the foreman's persedition of her. She had a pleasant voice--one of those sweet, timid, woman's voices, and undoubtedly is quite attractive. It was all I could do to resist peeping. I wanted to see <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> like.|$|E
5000|$|The {{keeper of}} the Sidhe's records, the Ban of Hours is very {{powerful}} but is also fond of humans and of Earth. No one who sees her can remember <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> like. <b>She</b> is Tonn's daughter, sister of Elme, and she [...] "stayed by Tonn when Elme defied him", although now she covertly opposes Tarax and the Maln.|$|R

60|$|In the {{afternoon}} Euchre set off with Duane, {{and soon they}} reached Bland's cabin. Duane remembered it as the one where {{he had seen the}} pretty woman watching him ride by. He could not recall <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> like. The cabin was the same as the other adobe structures in the valley, but it was larger and pleasantly located rather high up in a grove of cottonwoods. In the windows and upon the porch were evidences of a woman's hand. Through the open door Duane caught a glimpse of bright Mexican blankets and rugs.|$|E
60|$|Thus mused Godfrey, {{trying to}} picture to himself what Isobel looked {{like when she}} had stood by his side on that long-past autumn eve, and only succeeded in remembering exactly <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> like when she was kissing a rose with a certain knight in armour in a square garden, since for some perverse reason it was this picture that {{remained}} so painfully clear to his mind. Then he drifted off into speculations upon the general mystery of things of a sort that were common with him, and in these became oblivious of all else.|$|E

60|$|Charnock stopped.

60|$|Lady Chatterton, {{finding that}} little {{was to be}} {{expected}} in her present situation, excepting <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> forward to from the varying admiration of John Moseley to her youngest daughter, determined to accept an invitation of Borne standing to a nobleman's seat about fifty miles from the hall, and, in order to keep things in their proper places, to leave Grace with her friends, who had expressed a wish to that effect. Accordingly, the day succeeding the departure of her son, she proceeded on her expedition, accompanied by her willing assistant in the matrimonial speculations.|$|E
60|$|For {{the next}} day or two, Mrs. Cliff's joy in living again in her own home banished all other feelings, and as she was careful to say nothing to provoke more questions, and as those which were still asked became {{uncertain}} of aim and scattering, her regrets at her want of reticence began to fade. But, no matter what she did, where she went, or <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> at, Mrs. Cliff carried about with her a millstone. It did not hang from her neck, but it was in her pocket. It was not very heavy, but it was a burden to her. It was her money--which she wanted to spend, but dared not.|$|E
6000|$|In the {{agitation}} of the moment, {{when her}} swimming eyes and dizzy brain could hardly comprehend {{the sense of}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> upon, {{it is not surprising}} that Miss Vere should have omitted to remark that this letter seemed to rest her scruples rather upon the form and time of the proposed union, than on a rooted dislike to the suitor proposed to her. Mr. Vere rang the bell, and gave the letter to a servant to be delivered to Mr. Mareschal, and, rising from his chair, continued to traverse the apartment in silence and in great agitation until the answer was returned. He glanced it over, and wrung the hand of his daughter as he gave it to her. The tenor was as follows:-- ...|$|E
5000|$|Reason: Mrs. Shrager, Ms. Harbord, and Ms. Conner {{all felt}} that Amandas {{constant}} fighting and cursing was disruptive.

50|$|Mika's mother {{walks into}} the room and asks Mika <b>what</b> <b>she</b> is <b>looking</b> at; Mika says that, for a moment, <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> like Chizuko, which she finds strange, as they don't look much alike. Mika's mother says that, in fact, <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> exactly like Chizuko, but has her own personality.|$|R
60|$|She {{stood on}} the extreme edge, and, shading {{her eyes with her}} hand, <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> up and down the broad expanse of sand--a great untenanted wilderness.
