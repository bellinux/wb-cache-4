25|$|In 1870, {{police in}} Newcastle upon Tyne were {{recorded}} as 'in dispute' with their local Watch Committee over conditions {{of work and}} low pay, though they did not withdraw from duty. Two years later in 1872, 179 men of the Metropolitan Police refused to report for duty. They were protesting the poor conditions of their service and low pay, as had the police in Newcastle upon Tyne. The police <b>were</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> beat within hours. Of the 179 men who refused duty, 69 were dismissed from the force. The rest were allowed back on duty after having had apologised for their conduct. They gained improvements in pay and conditions. This action was significant for establishing a precedent for collective action by police {{in order to improve}} working conditions.|$|E
25|$|The Emir Farouk sank {{in about}} five minutes. Yohai Bin-Nun, {{who was in the}} reserve boat, noticed the mistake made by Vardi, and himself rammed the {{minesweeper}}. He was spotted and fired at, and managed to eject from his boat only 40m short of the target. The minesweeper suffered significant damage, but did not sink and was hauled back to Alexandria. It was subsequently scrapped by the Egyptian Navy. Egyptian coastal artillery opened a barrage on the general area, but did not spot their targets. The extraction boat collected the commandos and remained in the area to assess the damage, estimating about 200–300 Egyptian survivors. At 22:25 it started moving toward where it believed the Maoz was. The commandos, despite spotting it from a very close range, found the Maoz closer than they had thought, and by 23:10 all the commandos <b>were</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ship.|$|E

25|$|In early June 1940, about 13,500 {{evacuees}} {{were shipped}} to Casablanca in French Morocco. However, following the capitulation of the French to the German armies in June 1940 {{and the destruction}} of the French fleet at Mers el-Kebir by the British fleet, the new Pro-German French Vichy Government asked for all Gibraltarians to be removed. An opportunity for their removal soon arose when 15 British cargo vessels arrived at Casablanca under Commodore Crichton, repatriating French servicemen rescued from Dunkirk. Once they had disembarked, the ships were interned until they agreed to take on all the evacuees. Although Crichton could not clean and restock his ships (and contrary to British Admiralty orders which forbade the taking on of evacuees), he eventually agreed to do so. However, when the evacuees arrived in Gibraltar, the Governor, Sir Clive Liddel, did not allow them to land, fearing that once the evacuees <b>were</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>The</b> Rock, it would be virtually impossible to re-evacuate them. Crowds gathered at John Mackintosh Square as the news of the orders not to land broke, speeches were made and two City Councilors accompanied by the Acting President of the Exchange and Commercial Library went to see the Governor Liddell to ask that the evacuees be allowed to land. After receiving instructions from London, a landing was allowed as long as the evacuees returned when other ships arrived, and by 13 July the re-evacuation had been completed.|$|E
500|$|At 13:00, the German {{formations}} were plotted {{making their}} way back to France. Churchill was delighted with the results. The WAAF had been due to change shift, but the scheduled relief time could not take place during an operation. By 13:05 the fighters <b>were</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground.

500|$|In early June 1940, about 13,500 {{evacuees}} {{were shipped}} to Casablanca in French Morocco. However, following the capitulation of the French to the German armies later in June 1940, the new Pro-German French Vichy Government found {{the presence of}} Gibraltarian evacuees in Casablanca an embarrassment and sought opportunities for their removal. The opportunity soon arose when 15 British cargo vessels arrived under Commodore Crichton, repatriating 15,000 French servicemen who had been rescued from Dunkirk. Once their own rescued servicemen had disembarked, the ships were interned until they agreed to take away all the evacuees. Although Crichton was unable to obtain permission to clean and restock his ships (and contrary to British Admiralty orders which forbade the taking on of evacuees), {{when he saw the}} mass of civilians pouring through the dockyards, he opened up his gangways for boarding. Just beforehand, the British fleet had destroyed a number of French warships at Mers el-Kebir in order to prevent them ending up in German hands. The attack, during which 1,297 French sailors died, led to high tensions, which were evident when families were forced at bayonet point by French troops to board taking only what they could carry, leaving many possessions behind. However, when they arrived at Gibraltar, the Governor would not allow them to land, fearing that once the evacuees <b>were</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Rock, it would be virtually impossible to evacuate them a second time. [...] Crowds gathered in John Mackintosh Square in the centre of Gibraltar as the news broke, speeches were made and two City Councillors accompanied by the Acting President of the Exchange and Commercial Library went to see the Governor (Sir Clive Liddell) to ask that the evacuees be allowed to land.

2500|$|High Wood {{was judged}} to be untenable and at [...] the 91st Brigade was {{withdrawn}} and the wood was bombarded by the divisional artillery.

2500|$|By [...] it {{was clear}} that the 15th Division attack had failed; the line was only a few yards forward on the right and in the centre and the few {{survivors}} of the attack <b>were</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> start line. At [...] the troops on the right flank of the 61st Division began to fall back until rallied on a line dug slightly north of Somme Farm. On the right flank, the 13th RS made several attempts to get forward by shell-hole rushes but found it impossible against the massed machine-gun fire from the German fortifications. Two small German counter-attacks from [...] were driven off with help from the 47th Division to the south and German small-arms fire was eventually subdued by constant rifle and Lewis-gun fire. During the evening, reports were received of troops near Beck House, Borry Farm, Iberian Farm and Gallipoli and orders were issued to rush the positions in the dark. The attacks failed against alert opposition but the line was advanced about [...] towards Gallipoli, until cross fire stopped the advance and the new position was consolidated.|$|E

2500|$|By dark the British <b>were</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{start line}} and the German {{artillery}} deluged the forward British positions and batteries, tracks and roads east of Ypres and hit railheads, dumps and camps west of the city with long-range guns. The Germans fired area bombardments every day at intervals behind the British front but it was soon possible to predict the targets and avoid the worst spots. German shells sank into the mud before exploding, which threw up mud spouts with little explosive effect. British shells fitted with the instantaneous No. 106 Fuze worked better but still with limited effect. On 6 November, the last fresh brigade of the 5th Division attacked the spur at [...] after the divisional artillery had been reinforced to one 18-pounder for every [...] of front, some firing shrapnel and some with HE shells fitted with fuzes 106. Heavy artillery bombarded the German pillboxes with HE shells but the pillboxes were so small that few were hit. As the British infantry advanced behind the creeping barrage, they were caught by German machine-gun fire; confused fighting began in the château grounds and the British got within [...] of the ruins.

This new Intermediate Line was full of German troops and the III Corps headquarters immediately cancelled the 19th Division attack on the Switch Line, to make the new line the first objective. On the night of [...] the 51st Division attacked High Wood with two battalions of the 154th Brigade at [...] to capture the rest of the wood and [...] of the Switch Line. The British bombardment had begun at [...] on 22 July, under the direction of low-flying British artillery-observation aircraft. German sources reported that the shelling was of painful accuracy and prevented the troops in High Wood from being relieved, despite the number of casualties. One battalion lost direction in the wood and had many casualties to machine-gun fire.
