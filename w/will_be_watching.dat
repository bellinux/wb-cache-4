5|$|I was {{thinking}} about how Portland is designed and planned and built, and how the planning and infrastructure of Portland is really important in what makes Portland great. I {{was thinking}} of the static tripod as the infrastructure. The moving part was the vibrancy and life.... The most interesting part of the sculpture <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>watching</b> people try to move it.|$|E
5|$|At the {{shipping}} yard, Dexter breaks into the container in the picture, {{only to find}} it full of bananas. Doakes appears and asks him what he is doing, and after a fist fight, a foreman arrives and orders them to leave. Doakes tells Dexter that {{he knows that he}} is up to something, and says that he <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>watching</b> him. Meanwhile, Rita is contacted by an imprisoned Paul, who contends that Dexter knocked him out and set him up. Rita becomes annoyed as Paul persists that Dexter is dangerous and should not be around their children. Rita is visited by Paul's Narcotics Anonymous sponsor, who attempts to convince Rita that Paul is telling the truth. In a final plea, Paul calls Rita and tells her to search their house for a shoe which he believes came off when Dexter knocked him out. Rita hangs up, but discovers the shoe while taking out the trash {{at the end of the}} episode.|$|E

50|$|On 21 September, it was {{announced}} during a meeting that impacts of bullets had been found on the external walls of the expatriate’s residence. The commander of the village promised that the neighbourhood of the compound <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>watched</b> more carefully.|$|R
500|$|Leslie (Amy Poehler) {{visits the}} Pawnee {{high school to}} confront Greg Pikitis (Cody Klop), a {{teenager}} who she describes as her [...] "arch-nemesis". Leslie warns Greg she knows he vandalizes the town's statue of Mayor Percy every Halloween, but that she <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>watching</b> him closely and will catch him this year. Greg casually denies having any such plans. At the Pawnee town hall, Ann (Rashida Jones) talks excitedly about her upcoming Halloween party. She asks the others not to mention it to Tom (Aziz Ansari), but she is disappointed to learn Jerry (Jim O'Heir) has already told him. That night, Leslie watches Greg {{with the help of}} her boyfriend, Pawnee police officer Dave Sanderson (Louis C.K.), while Andy (Chris Pratt), who now has a part-time job with the parks department, guards the statue.|$|E
500|$|After {{reading an}} article about the iLoo, Andrew Cubitt, {{inventor}} of the similarly named i-Loo, wrote to The Inquirer stating that iLoo [...] "sounds remarkably similar... it now seems that the clever people at Microsoft have cottoned onto the idea and even call it the i-Loo, the same as mine!" [...] Cubitt {{went on to say that}} [...] "mine did everything that the Microsoft one is meant to do, but additionally printed information on toilet paper and didn't use a keyboard for the interface due to hygiene reasons". The i-Loo was prototyped by Cubitt as part of his thesis for his 2001 university degree in Product Design and Engineering at Brunel University. In an interview with The Inquirer, he noted [...] "As it was designed at the university, they own the partial rights to the product so they <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>watching</b> the Microsoft 'invention' very closely." ...|$|E
500|$|The team {{rested on}} December 29—the day {{following}} their final regular-season game. They began preparations {{for their first}} post-season game on Tuesday, December 30 through Thursday, January 1, before three days of weekend rest. Roethlisberger did not practice until Monday, January 5—Tomlin stated of the injury, [...] "We will proceed slowly with him because we have that luxury. But we feel comfortable with where he is relative to Sunday and where he’s capable of being next week." [...] Although the January 1 practice {{was expected to be}} normal, Tomlin allowed players to leave after team meetings and a walk-through. Multiple Steelers stated that they would watch the games of the Wild Card round. Some including James Farrior and Ryan Clark watched as fans; however, Chris Hoke said, [...] "I <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>watching</b> the guys I am going against... That is how I watch it." ...|$|E

There <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a hue and cry after you, and all the {{northern}} routes <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>watched.</b> No, I shall make a bargain with some Dutch skipper to take us across the water, {{and then we will}} make our way to Paris." ...|$|R

"We must mount at once," [...] {{he said to}} the troopers; [...] "my enemies {{have failed}} twice, but they might not fail the third time, and by {{tomorrow}} morning it is certain that the hotel <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>watched.</b> I have a pass to issue out through the gate at once." ...|$|R
500|$|In the episode, Bart {{appears on}} the talk show Late Night with Conan O'Brien. Conan O'Brien was a writer for The Simpsons during the fourth and {{early part of the}} fifth seasons. During the {{production}} of the episode, he received an audition to replace David Letterman as the host of Late Night on NBC, after Letterman defected to CBS. The writers decided that since the episode featured Bart getting famous, it would give them an opportunity to work in O'Brien's show. The part was written just after O'Brien's audition for Late Night, but before he {{knew he was going to}} be the host. O'Brien recorded his part shortly after Late Night with Conan O'Brien premiered, but he believed NBC would have fired him before the episode aired. He described being a guest star on the show as [...] "really delightful", adding that [...] "it's like being frozen in amber. I know people <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>watching</b> The Simpsons long after I'm dead." ...|$|E
2500|$|The lake also {{supports}} a strong sport fishery. While commercial fishing declined, sport fishing has remained. The deep cool waters that spawn the best fishing {{is in the}} Canadian side of the lake. As a result, a fishing boat that crosses the international border triggers the security concerns of border crossings and fishermen are advised to have their passport. If their boat crosses the invisible border line in the lake, upon returning to the American shore, passengers will have to [...] "drive to a local government reporting station and pose for pictures" [...] to Customs officers by videophone. There are cumbersome rules for fishing boat operators as well, {{who will have to}} fax passenger personal information to a government agency an hour before leaving; officers <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>watching</b> and doing spot checks from patrol boats and government aircraft". Authorities in 2008 from the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission have tried stocking the lake with brown trout in an effort to build what's called a put-grow-and-take fishery. There was a report that charter boat fishing increased substantially on the American side, from 46 to 638 charter boats in operation in Ohio alone, during a period from 1975 to 1985 as pollution levels declined, and after populations of walleye increased substantially in the lake. In 1984, Ohio sold 27,000 nonresident fishing permits, and sport fishing was described as big business. In 1992, there were accounts of fishermen catching 8, 10, and 12 pound walleyes, and that the [...] "runt of a five-man daily limit of 25 walleye might be a nuisance of 5 pounds." [...] It is possible to fish off piers in winter for a fish called the burbot, also known by pseudonyms such as eelpout, mudblow, lawyer fish, cusk, or freshwater cod which looks [...] "ugly" [...] but tastes great; the burbot make a midwinter spawning run and is reportedly one of [...] "Erie's glacial relics." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Better sit tight," [...] he enjoined. [...] "Drop it now {{or people}} <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>watching</b> us. I have ordered {{some of the}} old brandy. A liqueur or two will steady you, perhaps. Afterwards we will go upstairs and take your sister into our confidence." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It is {{the best}} way, anyhow," [...] he said. [...] "To-morrow, no doubt, the fellow I had the row with <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>watching</b> the hotel to see which way I go off, but after once seeing {{me go to the}} hotel he will not guess that I shall be {{starting}} this evening.

6000|$|... "It is {{important}} that we should land where there is some sort of a path. I noticed one or two such places as we came along. We may as well get into the dinghy and row down and choose a spot now. Of course, they <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>watching</b> from the brigantine, but when they see the same number that went come back again, they will suppose that we have only gone for a row, or perhaps to get a shot at anything we come across. We may as well take a couple of guns with us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{a slender}} chance, David," [...] she remarked.

6000|$|... "I mean," [...] he said, [...] "that {{when you}} leave here for Paris you <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>watched</b> day and night.

The election <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a test for the nascent Afghan state, the ability of American and other forces to maintain peace in the country, and for Afghan unity. It is also an election, at least at the presidential level, where the outcome is a foregone conclusion. It is almost certain that Afghan president Hamid Karzai <b>will</b> <b>be</b> reelected...|$|R
6000|$|... "No such thing--she {{will make}} a {{different}} man of you. You have been depressed by--that early shock, and the gap at our own fireside--all that we have shared together, Norman.

6000|$|... "No," [...] Nat said. [...] "If {{they are}} behind us, they <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>watching</b> our trail; {{and if they}} see we change our pace, they will be after us like a pack of wolves; while, {{as long as we}} walk slowly and carelessly, they will let us go. If it were dark, we might make a run for it, but there ain't no chance at present. If we took to the lake, we should have a hundred canoes after us, while the woods are full of Indians, and a whoop of the Owl would bring a hundred of them down onto our track." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Larry quietly. [...] "I bluffed {{it out of}} Harper. He {{would have}} taken a hand in, and only kicked when it came to taking lives. More of the others cleared out over that point, too, and as the rest were half-afraid of some of those who objected giving them away, they changed their plans; but it seems quite certain they mean to pull the rails up at the bend on the down grade by the bunch grass hollow. It is fortunate, any way. Cheyne and his cavalry <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>watching</b> the bridge, you see; but you had better get ready.
