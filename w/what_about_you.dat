You see, the Church spiritual can't make good in this age--has no chance of making good, and so in the main it's given it up for vested interests and social influence. Your father is a symbol of what the Church is not. But <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>you,</b> my dear? There's a room at my boarding-house, and only one old lady besides myself, who knits all the time.
