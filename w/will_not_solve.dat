The Western Australian Department of Environment and Conservation has been working with the University of Sydney to develop baits to train native animals not to eat the toads. By blending bits of toad with a nausea-inducing chemical, the baits train the animals {{to stay away from the}} amphibians. Researcher David Pearson says trials run in laboratories and in remote parts of the Kimberley region of WA are looking promising, although the baits <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>solve</b> the cane toad problem altogether.|$|E

Over a {{thousand}} protested during Sri Lankan foreign minister Rohitha Bogollagama's visit to Australia on 14 October 2008. The protest {{took place in}} Canberra outside the National Press Club. The protesters accused the Sri Lankan government alleging attack on civilians and the prevention of aid by the United Nations reaching affected areas. In response to the protests, Australian foreign minister Stephen Smith stated that he raised the concern of the violence amid the civil war. He also assured that Australia insists that military means <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>solve</b> the problem and that a political solution can only result in {{the ending of the}} war.|$|E

In anticipation to the 14 August protests, the MoI stepped up security measures and further warned {{that it will take}} legal action toward those who participate. The MOI has warned Bahrainis: [...] The Prime Minister joined the MoI in warning against planned protests. [...] The Al Wefaq opposition movement slammed the warnings and affirmed [...] "the [...] right to protest peacefully". [...] "This <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>solve</b> the political crisis. The solution is in satisfying the people's aspirations for liberty, social justice and democracy," [...] Al Wefaq added. Other opposition societies such as National Democratic Action Society (Waad) and Nationalist Democratic Assembly also joined Al Wefaq in affirming the rights of freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. Mainstream opposition societies cancelled a planned mass protest on 14 August, [...] "because of the heavily intimidating security presence in Manama".|$|E

This would allow Ma to be able to meet with People's Republic of China (PRC) President Hu Jintao (at the time the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China) and other PRC delegates, as {{he would be able to}} represent the KMT as the leader of a Chinese political party, rather than as head-of-state of a political entity unrecognized by the PRC. Ma, however, ruled out meeting his PRC counterpart Hu Jintao in a 14 July 2009 interview with Taiwan's Commercial Times newspaper.

2500|$|His {{first article}} criticising {{practical}} Zionism, called [...] "Lo ze haderekh" [...] (This {{is not the}} way) published in 1888 appeared in HaMelitz. In it, he wrote that the Land of Israel will not be capable of absorbing all of the Jewish Diaspora, not even a majority of them. [...] Ahad Ha'am also argued that establishing a [...] "national home" [...] in Zion <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>solve</b> the [...] "Jewish problem"; furthermore, the physical conditions in Eretz Yisrael will discourage Aliyah, and thus Hibbat Zion must educate and strengthen Zionist values among the Jewish people enough that they will want to settle the land despite the greatest difficulties. [...] The ideas in this article became the platform for Bnei Moshe Sor (sons of Moses), a group he founded that year. B'nei Moshe Sor, active until 1897, worked to improve Hebrew education, build up a wider audience for Hebrew literature, and assist the Jewish settlements. [...] Perhaps more significant was Derekh Kehayim (1889), Ha'am's attempt to launch a unique movement from a fundamentalist perspective incorporating {{all the elements of}} a national revival, but driven by force of intellect.|$|E

General Smuts has warned not only the Empire, but the whole world of the gigantic threat to civilization that lies in the present division of Africa between various keenly competitive European Powers, any one of which will be free to misuse the great natural resources at its disposal and to arm millions of black soldiers for aggression. A mere elimination of Germany from Africa <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>solve</b> that difficulty. What we have to eliminate is not this nation or that, but the system of national shoving and elbowing, the treatment of Africa as the board for a game of beggar-my-neighbour-and-damn-the-niggers, in which a few syndicates, masquerading as national interests, snatch a profit to the infinite loss of all mankind. We want a lowering of barriers and a unification of interests, we want an international control of these disputed regions, to override nationalist exploitation. The whole world wants it. It is a chastened and reasonable world we live in to-day, and the time for white reason and the wide treatment of these problems is now.|$|E
