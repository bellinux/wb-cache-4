It {{has been known}} that slurry rheology significantly influences the grindability of industrial minerals in <b>wet</b> ultrafine <b>grinding.</b> This review represents some previous work with respect to slurry rheology in ultrafine grinding. In this review, some methods for the characterization of the slurry rheology and some empirical equations modelling rheological behaviours of slurries were presented. The semiempirical model incorporating slurry rheology, solids concentration, particle size and slurry temperature was described. In addition, on-line measurement for the slurry rheology control was also discussed. In the case of ultrafine grinding, various parameters (such as solid concentration, particle size and distribution, particle shape, temperature, rotation and pH, use of dispersants), which affect the slurry rheology, have been described. It was revealed that the optimization of the rheological behaviours of slurry in ultrafine grinding could increase throughput, energy efficiency and product fineness as well.

40|$|This thesis investigates {{rheology}} {{of limestone}} slurries {{and its effects}} on <b>wet</b> ultra-fine <b>grinding</b> in order to reduce energy cost and increase the throughput and the product fineness. The influences of solids concentration, molecular weight of a dispersant, particle size and distribution, and temperature on the rheological behaviours of limestone slurries have been investigated with rotational and cone-plate viscometers. The results reveal that when the solids concentration of a limestone slurry (75 wt. % or 52. 63 vol. %). At a certain shear rate, the apparent viscosity and the relative viscosity of the slurry increase exponentially with the solids concentration. The extrapolated Bingham yield stress increases in a power- law form with increasing solids concentration when the solids concentration of the slurry is larger than 70 wt. % (i. e., 46. 36 vol. %). The maximum packing solids fraction attainable is predicted as 64. 6 vol. % at the certain limestone-water suspension system. Besides, the smaller the particle size, the more evident the pseudoplastic property of limestone slurry are with a larger yield stress and a larger apparent viscosity at a given shear rate. Furthermore, the apparent viscosity and the extrapolated Bingham decrease with increasing temperature in a range of 20 to 40 oC. Also, <b>wet</b> ultra-fine <b>grinding</b> of a limestone powder (83 vol. %). For a certain level of bead load, an optimal solids concentration exists for more effective grinding.

5000|$|The {{wet process}} {{suffered}} the obvious disadvantage that, when the slurry was {{introduced into the}} kiln, {{a large amount of}} extra fuel was used in evaporating the water. Furthermore, a larger kiln was needed for a given clinker output, because much of the kiln's length was used up for the drying process. On the other hand, the wet process had a number of advantages. <b>Wet</b> <b>grinding</b> of hard minerals is usually much more efficient than dry grinding. When slurry is dried in the kiln, it forms a granular crumble that is ideal for subsequent heating in the kiln. In the dry process, {{it is very difficult to}} keep the fine powder rawmix in the kiln, because the fast-flowing combustion gases tend to blow it back out again. It became a practice to spray water into dry kilns in order to [...] "damp down" [...] the dry mix, and thus, for many years there was little difference in efficiency between the two processes, and the overwhelming majority of kilns used the wet process. By 1950, a typical large, wet process kiln, fitted with drying-zone heat exchangers, was 3.3 x 120 m in size, made 680 tonnes per day, and used about 0.25-0.30 tonnes of coal fuel for every tonne of clinker produced. Before the energy crisis of the 1970s put an end to new wet-process installations, kilns as large as 5.8 x 225 m in size were making 3000 tonnes per day.|$|E

5000|$|The {{history of}} the {{development}} of the technology of raw material grinding defines the early history of cement technology. Other stages of cement manufacture used existing technology in the early days. Early hydraulic materials such as hydraulic limes, natural cements and Parker's Roman cement were all based on [...] "natural" [...] raw materials, burned [...] "as-dug". Because these natural blends of minerals occur only rarely, manufacturers were interested in making a fine-grained artificial mixture of readily available minerals such as limestone and clay {{that could be used in}} the same way. A typical problem would be to make an intimate mixture of 75% chalk and 25% clay, and burn this to produce an ”artificial cement". The development of the [...] "wet" [...] method of producing fine-grained clay in the ceramics industry afforded a means of doing this. For this reason, the early cement industry used the [...] "wet process", in which the raw materials are ground together with water, to produce a slurry, containing 20-50% water. Both Louis Vicat and James Frost used this technique in the early 19th century, and it remained the only way of making rawmix for Portland cement until 1890. A modification of the technique used by the early industry was [...] "double-burning", in which a hard limestone would be burned and slaked before combining with clay slurry. This technique avoided the grinding of hard stone, and was employed by, among others, Joseph Aspdin. Early grinding technology was poor, and early slurries were made thin, with a high water content. The slurry was then allowed to stand in large reservoirs ("slurry-backs") for several weeks. Large, un-ground particles would drop to the bottom, and excess water rose to the top. The water was periodically decanted until a stiff cake, of the consistency of pottery clay, was left. This was sliced up, discarding the coarse material at the bottom, and burned in the kiln. <b>Wet</b> <b>grinding</b> is comparatively energy-efficient, and so when good dry-grinding equipment became available, the wet process continued in use throughout the 20th century, often employing equipment that Josiah Wedgwood would have recognized.|$|E

The particle sizing {{plays an important role}} in interpretation, control and optimization of various aspects of the <b>wet</b> <b>grinding</b> process. There is a lack of knowledge in understanding different aspects of particle sizing during a <b>wet</b> <b>grinding</b> process. The particle sizing in a <b>wet</b> <b>grinding</b> process is typical in the sense: (i) The dispersions in a <b>wet</b> <b>grinding</b> process, often, involve additives and (or) impurities. It is less known how impurities and additives influence the particle size of the dispersions in the <b>wet</b> <b>grinding</b> process. (ii) In a <b>wet</b> <b>grinding</b> process, dispersions of different concentrations may be used. It is less known how dispersions of different concentration may influence the particle sizing in a <b>wet</b> <b>grinding</b> process. (iii) In a <b>wet</b> <b>grinding</b> process, the change in average particle size of the product is rapid due to relatively fast breakage of the particles. (iv) The degree of poly dispersity in product changes with grinding time. (v) The nature of interaction between particles is non-colloidal before grinding process; this interaction becomes colloidal after a certain grinding time. Similarly, there is a lack of knowledge to understand how quality of final ground product is influenced in a <b>wet</b> <b>grinding</b> process. This study investigates the different aspects of particle sizing and product quality of aqueous dispersions of CaCO 3 in a <b>wet</b> <b>grinding</b> process carried out in a stirred media mill. Acoustic attenuation spectroscopy that is known for measuring particle size of dispersions on line, under real process conditions and without diluting the sample has been employed in the study in addition to the technique of dynamic light scattering. The study brings out the conditions in which the effects of impurities and additives etc. on particle size of the dispersions may be determined using acoustic attenuation spectroscopy. Furthermore, the study compares and analyze the particle sizing results obtained though acoustic attenuation spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering. The causes of differences in the results of two techniques have been investigated.
