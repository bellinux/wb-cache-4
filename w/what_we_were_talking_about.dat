500|$|Selman {{wanted to}} include {{things in the}} episode that [...] "only really hard-core foodies would have any idea <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> This was like a love letter to foodie culture." [...] Food {{references}} featured in the episode include jokes about sriracha sauce and sous-vide cooking, referrals to chefs Wylie Dufresne, Frank Bruni, and Ruth Reichl, a mention of the soup phở from Vietnam and how to pronounce it correctly, and {{the inclusion of the}} El Chemistri owner who is based on the Spanish chef José Andrés (known for using molecular gastronomy). Selman has commented that food produced with the help of molecular gastronomy [...] "lends itself to comedy quite nicely. There’s a dish , for instance, called Regret. The waiter cries into your soup when he serves it. The human tear is the final ingredient." [...] The fictional character Swedish Chef is also seen in the episode, and the scene where the meth dealer is reminded of his childhood after eating the apple pie is a reference to the Pixar film Ratatouille, which was written and directed by former Simpsons consultant Brad Bird.|$|E
60|$|Her husband, {{who speaks}} only French, now asked <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about,</b> and she {{repeated}} the conversation.|$|E
6000|$|Miss Ramsey: [...] "Oh, I forgot. And I don't know <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> myself." [...] She falls limply {{back into}} her chair and closes her eyes.|$|E
5000|$|The {{subject in}} which <b>we</b> never know <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> about, nor whether <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> saying is true. Bertrand Russell 1901 ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Purfleet {{would give}} sixpence to know <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> about, Bob," [...] {{one of the}} group talking {{in the corner of the}} {{playground}} said.|$|R
6000|$|... "On--on everything. On <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about,--the {{carnival}} feeling, the levity, on the unbelief of the age. Isn't {{it because}} the control has been taken off?" ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{filled his}} pipe {{and turned to}} Jim. [...] "Hope I didn't interrupt. I forget <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> It looks as if you didn't like a waiter's job." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind," [...] I answered. [...] "Let us {{go on with}} <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> Tell me {{how long}} you stayed with Mrs. Clements in London, and how you came here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Poet!" [...] she smiled. [...] "No, it isn't quite poinsetta. It's {{nearer the}} red-orange {{of a tree}} I {{remember}} one autumn, in the White Mountains, with the setting sun on it. But that wasn't <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> Laurels! Your laurels." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What is the affair, my Lord?" [...] {{said the}} Queen. [...] "Let us find out <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> about, lest <b>we</b> should misconstrue and {{misunderstand}} each other." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am sure of it. Now {{remember}} <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> about. When <b>we</b> meet again, {{we shall}} see which of us two will love each other the most.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Go!’ she said. ‘Go now at once. My {{brain is}} in a whirl. I scarce know <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking.</b> Go; and good-night; and oh, may you come safe!’ ...|$|R
60|$|Look at the {{influence}} of a mere play of physiognomy! If you remember <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> you will hardly believe that I caught myself grinning down at that demure little girl. I must say too that I felt more friendly to her at the moment than ever before.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come in with me," [...] she begged. [...] "Somehow, I feel {{cold and}} lonely to-night. It hasn't {{anything}} to do with <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about,</b> but I feel as though something were going to happen, that something were coming out of the shadows, something that threatens either you or me. I'm silly, but come." ...|$|E
6000|$|My {{companion}} and I, having {{a discussion on}} some point of ancient history, were amused by the attitude which the Indian, who could not tell <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about,</b> assumed. He constituted himself umpire, and, judging by our air and gesture, he very seriously remarked from time to time, [...] "You beat," [...] or [...] "He beat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Go!" [...] she said, [...] "Go now at once! My {{brain is}} in a whirl. I scarce know <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking.</b> Go; and good-night; and oh, may you come safe!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are safe}} right here, {{if you have}} sense enough to stay here," [...] {{declared}} Jerry Muskrat rather testily. [...] "Don't you suppose Peter and I know <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> about?" ...|$|R
60|$|After this, {{it will be}} {{necessary}} to define superstition, in order to have some tolerably clear understanding of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> about. I beg leave to define it as--Fear of the unknown.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing {{to speak}} of is so apt to grow into that which has to be spoken of." [...] So much the father said at breakfast, hardly giving his mind to the matter discussed,--his mind being on other things. But when their breakfast was eaten, then it was {{necessary}} that he should begin. [...] "Silverbridge," [...] he said, [...] "I hope you have thought better of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> as to these coming elections." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing," [...] {{cried the}} general. [...] "When {{did you ever}} know a woman punctual, my lad? If we wait for your mother--and she's such a rabid aristocrat {{that she would never}} forgive us for not waiting--we shan't sign the {{contract}} yet this half-hour. Never mind! let's go on with <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> Where the devil was I when that cursed clock struck and interrupted us? Now then, Black Eyes, what's the matter?" ...|$|E
60|$|As a beginning, and {{in order}} that Archie and Harvey might {{understand}} the better why I had brought the Tory with me, Hiram insisted upon my telling once more {{the story of what}} had happened since I crept out through the tunnel, and this I did, speaking cautiously, as you can well fancy, for if peradventure Master Lord had heard the hum of our conversation he would have made it his business to learn <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Let us {{get down}} {{first of all}} to bedrock and find out <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> about," [...] Dick was prompt on the uptake. [...] "What is woman?" [...] he demanded {{with an air of}} earnestness.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I declare I {{never knew}} {{anything}} like you. What can it signify to you, <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> of. Perhaps <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> about you; therefore I would advise {{you not to}} listen, or you may happen to hear something not very agreeable." ...|$|R
50|$|Some {{practitioners}} and portfolio managers seem to completely ignore or dismiss volatility forecasting models. For example, Nassim Taleb famously titled {{one of his}} Journal of Portfolio Management papers We Don't Quite Know <b>What</b> <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>Talking</b> About When <b>We</b> Talk About Volatility.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes, {{it must be}} so," [...] {{answered}} Florida, {{staring down}} on the crowd with unseeing eyes, [...] "but I can't fix my mind on it. I keep thinking the whole time of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> yesterday. I never could have dreamed of a priest's disbelieving; but now I can't dream of anything else. It {{seems to me that}} none of these priests or monks can believe anything. Their faces look false and sly and bad--all of them!" ...|$|E
60|$|Oh, how {{delightful}} {{it was to}} be safe in the boat, {{after our}} trials and fears! We ate a hearty supper, George and I, and we should have had some toddy after it, if we could have found the whisky, but we could not. We examined Harris as to what he had done with it; but he did not seem to know what we meant by “whisky,” or <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> at all. Montmorency looked as if he knew something, but said nothing.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought it}} was," [...] the smith said. [...] "I {{caught sight of}} your figure against the light up there in front. I couldn't help thinking, when you shouted at my door {{that there was a}} fire at The Hold, <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> this evening, and your saying that if the place was yours you would pull it down stone by stone. But perhaps we may save it yet. We shall have a couple of score of men there in a few minutes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That <b>is</b> just <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about," [...] Charlie said, when Stanislas had {{repeated}} the captain's speech, [...] "and the danger seems {{too great to}} be risked. Think you, that when we get farther to the east, <b>we</b> shall <b>be</b> able to make our way more easily up into Livonia?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{want to know}} <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about," [...] said Mrs. Travers, {{altering}} slowly {{her position}} so as to confront d'Alcacer whose face was almost undistinguishable. [...] "Oh, well, then, we talked about opera, the realities and illusions of the stage, of dresses, of people's names, {{and things of that}} sort." ...|$|R
5000|$|Questions {{concerning}} {{politics are}} central on the Kammerbühne (chamber stage). There, The Stronghold of Europe is {{being looked at}} from various perspectives. A number of events and theatre layouts are concerned with questions such as: Who decides who is allowed to live here? <b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> about when <b>we</b> talk about Europe? Who belongs to Europe? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Cadiz has but one fault: {{the space}} {{on which it}} stands is too small for a great city. You see how close the houses stand together, and how narrow are the streets. It cannot spread without {{extending}} beyond the rock over the sands, and then its strength would be gone, {{and it would be}} open to capture by an enterprising enemy having command of the sea. There now, having indulged your humour, let us return to more important matters. Have you thought over <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> last night?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Eh? Oh, he's gone," [...] said Sam. [...] "I {{persuaded him}} to go away. He was a little excited, poor fellow. And now let us return to <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> You say...." [...] He broke off with an exclamation, and glanced at his watch. [...] "Good Heavens! I {{had no idea of}} the time. I promised to run up and see a man in one of the offices in the next court. He wants to consult me on some {{difficulty}} which has arisen with one of his clients. Rightly or wrongly he values my advice. Can you spare me for a short while? I shan't be more than ten minutes." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{first of}} these eccentricities {{consisted}} in the reappearance on several occasions of the odd expression in his eyes which I had first seen when he asked me whether I knew anything about the duel. No matter <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about,</b> or where we happened to be, {{there were times when}} he would suddenly look away from my face, now on one side of me, now on the other, but always where there was nothing to see, and always with the same intensity and fierceness in his eyes. This looked so like madness--or hypochondria at the least--that I felt afraid to ask him about it, and always pretended not to observe him.|$|E
40|$|The {{invocation}} {{of the notion}} of a “knowledge society ” has become ubiquitous. Among its many dangers is that it creates the illusion that <b>we</b> know <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> about when <b>we</b> talk about “knowledge”. This paper claims that, when it comes to knowledge, we do not know <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> about. More specifically, this paper argues that the contemporary discourse on knowledge, particularly in Europe and North America, suffers from three major deficits: Deficit No. 1 : It does not take a critical enough view of what “knowledge ” means, and of the fundamental changes that the concept of knowledge has undergone {{in the course of the}} 20 th century. Deficit No. 2 : It fails to address the political conditions and consequences of the production and use of knowledge – in other words, it is oblivious to the politics of knowledge...|$|R
6000|$|The {{latter part}} of this address was {{scarcely}} heard by Darcy; but Sir William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, {{and his eyes were}} directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner, and said, [...] "Sir William's interruption has made me forget <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> of." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1952, Whyte {{coined the}} term [...] "Groupthink":Groupthink being a coinage - and, admittedly, a loaded one - a working {{definition}} <b>is</b> in order. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> not <b>talking</b> about mere instinctive conformity - it is, after all, a perennial failing of mankind. <b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> about <b>is</b> a rationalized conformity - an open, articulate philosophy which holds that group values are not only expedient but right and good as well.|$|R
