25|$|Exactly {{when the}} fierce rivalry between the {{supporters}} of the two clubs began is not entirely clear. Until {{as recently as the}} early 1970s, many fans <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> watch the other team when their side was playing away, indicating anything but hatred. Some ascribe the growing rivalry since then to the cities' diverging economic fortunes. In 2015, 10,000 people signed a petition against using a red and white livery (Southampton colours) on the Spinnaker Tower in Portsmouth. The city council subsequently came to an agreement with sponsors Emirates to use blue and gold (Portsmouth colours) instead.|$|E

During which time he still maintained his very successful grain business in the United States. The flour that would be produced in his flour mill would prove to be that worthy of popularity in not only Canada but also the United States and Britain. His introduction of a large steam flouring mill benefited the County of Essex’s farming community, which at this time made up most of the population, by encouraging farming practices.

25|$|Mercado Juárez {{was opened}} in 1912, {{the last major}} market to open before the Mexican Revolution brought market {{development}} to a halt. The war disrupted food production and distribution with the abandonment of haciendas, lack of manpower in the agricultural sector and the disruption of transportation systems. With {{the exception of the}} Abelardo L. Rodríguez market in 1934, there were no new markets constructed in Mexico City, other than small ones for newly established neighborhoods in the growing city. Outside of Mexico City, formal markets were still be introduced to replace older tianguis. The installation of fixed structures to replace tianguis did not always go well. In Xalapa, Veracruz a new, modern and at the time, spacious market was built and promoted in the 1940s to replace the weekly market at the Plazuela del Carbón. However, at first no one <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> shop there, making it a distinct failure. It took fifteen years of efforts to make the market accepted and profitable.|$|E

At the age of 12, {{he had his own}} library collection of 25 books, even though books were really expensive during that time. He would imitate the scholars by reading the books, and then give lectures {{to the rest of the}} village. If any women needed any information, they would wait till Syed Qutb came back from school, and ask him to share the knowledge he had to them. In many occasions he would be shy because he was a young man, but in some occasions he <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> teach the knowledge he had to the people who asked him.|$|E

500|$|The writing {{staff had}} never done a spring break episode before so they thought, [...] "What would Lisa and Bart do on spring break?" [...] {{and came up with}} the road trip plot. Bill Oakley, the show runner of The Simpsons at the time, said that road trips were {{something}} that the writers liked to write stories about. The idea of four children going on a road trip was [...] "so exciting" [...] that they immediately knew they wanted to write it. There was a debate over where the children <b>would</b> <b>go,</b> <b>and</b> Fort Lauderdale, Florida, was first suggested, but the writers eventually decided to have them go to a [...] "funny unlikely place". Oakley's show runner partner, Josh Weinstein, said that the writers were always looking for combinations of characters that had not been done many times on the show.

500|$|Claudio Abbado, {{principal}} guest conductor since 1971, succeeded Previn {{as chief}} conductor in the orchestra's diamond jubilee year, 1979. In a 1988 {{study of the}} LSO in Gramophone magazine James Jolly wrote that Abbado {{was in many ways}} the antithesis of Previn in terms of style and repertoire, bringing to the orchestra a particular authority in the Austro-German classics as well as a commitment to the avant-garde. From the orchestra's point of view there were disadvantages to his appointment. His relationship with the players was distant and he was unable to impose discipline on the orchestra in rehearsals. He insisted on conducting without a score, and many times this led to barely-avoided disaster in concerts. Abbado had considerable international prestige, but this too had its downside for the LSO: he frequently made his major recordings with the Boston or Chicago Symphony Orchestras or the Vienna Philharmonic. One of the LSO's principals commented, [...] "Although we were sweating our guts playing those vast Mahler symphonies for... Abbado, he <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> record them with other orchestras, which made us feel like second, maybe even third choice".|$|E
500|$|At Harrison's urging, Capitol Records, Apple's {{distributor}} in the United States, set {{all four}} of its manufacturing plants to producing copies of the [...] "Bangla Desh" [...] single; one-sided, white label promo discs were also rushed through to ensure immediate radio play for the song. For the US picture sleeve, designer Tom Wilkes chose a suitably topical image, incorporating headlines and text from New York Times articles about the Bangladesh crisis. The articles made mention of vultures being the [...] "happiest creatures" [...] amid the chaos in Dacca, and India's [...] "wait and see" [...] policy regarding events in East Pakistan. The front of the picture sleeve was topped with the line [...] "(We've Got to Relieve)" [...] before the words [...] "Bangla Desh", leading a number of publications to include the parenthetical text {{as part of the}} official song title. Boxed off {{at the foot of the}} front sleeve were details of the George Harrison–Ravi Shankar Special Emergency Relief Fund (care of UNICEF's New York headquarters), to which proceeds of the single <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> further donations were encouraged. The back cover of the US sleeve was taken from a UPI news agency photograph – an [...] "emotional" [...] image showing a mother comforting her starving child. This photo was also used in the aid project's magazine advertising campaign, as well as for the front of the single's picture sleeve in Denmark and Japan.|$|E

My idea is that she actually like figures it out, and finds some success and does really well in a different hospital. She was always floundering you know, and so she was always one step behind the eight ball and I want to see that girl take some power back." [...] She later went on to say that she regrets leaving the show, [...] "Oh yeah, sometimes, yeah. You miss it. I miss my friends. It was a great work environment ... and it becomes a family. I spent six years together with these people every day ... you grow up together, in a way," [...] and again commented on Izzie possibly returning to the show, [...] "I always felt that if they wanted me to come back and sort of wrap up that storyline ... I want them to know that I'm down with it if they want me to, but I completely understand if it doesn't necessarily work ... They've got a lot of story lines going on there." [...] But in March 2012, Shonda Rhimes said that there are no plans at the moment for the character to return, [...] "I think it was really nice to hear her appreciating the show. At the same time we are on a track we have been planning. The idea of changing that track is not something we are interested in right now." [...] Three years later, Rhimes said she has completely moved on from the idea of Izzie coming back, “I’m done with that story.

[...] Early the next morning Huddington's occupants went to confession and took the Sacrament at Mass—in Fraser's opinion, a sign that none of them thought they had long to live. [...] They collected further arms and munitions from Hewell Grange, but trying to recruit more people to their cause they were met with disdain; while the conspirators considered themselves to stand for [...] "God and country", the men of Hewell Grange replied that they were for [...] "King James as well as God and Country". [...] Late that night, pulling a sodden cart full of weapons and armour behind them, they arrived at Holbeche House, near Kingswinford in Staffordshire. [...] Robert was asked if he <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> see if he could elicit any help from his father-in-law, John Talbot at his mansion at 'Pepperhill'. [...] He refused, and Thomas went instead, with Stephen Littleton. [...] Talbot was, however, loyal to James, and sent them away, claiming that their visit was [...] "as much as his life was worth". [...] While returning to Holbeche, they received a message that Catesby, Rookwood, John Grant and another man were dead, and the rest apparently fled. [...] Tired and desperate, the plotters had attempted to dry their soaked gunpowder in front of the fire, only for a stray spark to ignite it. [...] While Littleton chose to leave, begging his companion to follow his example, Thomas continued on to Holbeche, where he found the remaining plotters alive, but injured.|$|E
