40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Biological & Agricultural EngineeringDanny H. RogersCenter pivot {{irrigation}} systems {{are used in}} crop production across the state of Kansas. The American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE) standard on uniformity testing of a center pivot system calls for collectors {{to be used to}} measure the water depth emitted by the irrigation system. The standard was designed without specially considering the low pressure sprinklers now commonly used on center pivot systems; the recommended collectors may not accurately measure the applied depth from these sprinklers. The collector size effect on measured water depth and measured depth variability was studied for spinning plate, fixed <b>plate,</b> and <b>wobbling</b> <b>plate</b> sprinkler systems. Five different collector sizes (C 2 (5. 5 cm), C 4 (10. 0 cm), C 6 (14. 8 cm), C 8 (20. 0 cm), and C 10 (27. 4 cm)) were studied using four 5 x 5 Latin squares. Each collector’s water depth was measured and statistically analyzed. Two analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests of the collector size effect were reported. Past experimental results were compared to this experiment’s results. The ANOVA for the measured water depth reported no collector size effect for the spinning <b>plate</b> and <b>wobbling</b> <b>plate</b> systems. The ANOVA of the variability of measured depths showed significant differences between collector sizes for the spinning plate system but not for the <b>wobbling</b> <b>plate</b> system. Previous studies of spinning <b>plate</b> and <b>wobbling</b> <b>plate</b> systems reported acceptable variability for all collector sizes. Although some collector sizes measured significantly different mean depths, the numerical difference in mean depths was small. Any studied collector size could be used to measure the water depth of <b>wobbling</b> <b>plate</b> systems, but the C 4 collector is ideal. C 4 and C 6 collectors are ideal for measuring spinning plate systems. Significant differences between measured depths were reported for the fixed plate system. The C 10 measured significantly lower water depths than all other collectors, and the C 4 collector measured lower depths than the C 2 and C 8 collectors. The variability of mean depths was similar and high for all collector sizes. Previous experiments also indicated that different collector sizes measured different depths and had high variability of depth measurements for the fixed plate sprinkler systems. The distinct stream pattern provides a challenge for accurately measuring the water depth with these collector sizes; other methods of measuring uniformity should be considered for fixed plate sprinklers...|$|R

In passenger car equipped with automatic transmissions the electronic management of the coupling between engine and transmission couldn’t provide sensible improvement of comfort and overall vehicle performance during gearshifts without the availability of dependable models of the flywheel, clutch and driveline as powerful tools for vehicle design engineers.

40|$|A {{mechanical}} {{model of}} an axial piston-type machine with a so-called <b>wobble</b> <b>plate</b> and Z-shaft mechanism is presented. The overall {{aim is to}} design and construct an oil-free piston expander demonstrator {{as a first step}} to realizing an advanced and compact small-scale steam engine system. The benefits of a small steam engine are negligible NOx emissions (due to continuous, low-temperature combustion), no gearbox needed, fuel flexibility (e. g., can run on biofuel and solar), high part-load efficiency, and low noise. Piston expanders, compared with turbines or clearance-sealed rotary displacement machines, have higher mechanical losses but lower leakage losses, much better part-load efficiency, and for many applications a more favourable (i. e., lower) speed. A piston expander is thus feasible for directly propelling small systems in the vehicular power range. An axial piston machine with minimized contact pressures and sliding velocities, and with properly selected construction materials for steam/water lubrication, should enable completely oil-free operation. An oil-free piston machine also has potential for other applications, for example, as a refrigerant (e. g., CO 2) expander in a low-temperature Rankine cycle or as a refrigerant compressor.   An analytical rigid-body kinematics and inverse dynamics model of the machine is presented. The kinematical analysis generates the resulting motion of the integral parts of the machine, fully parameterized. Inverse dynamics is applied when the system motion is completely known, and the method yields required external and internal forces and torques. The analytical model made use of the “Sophia” plug-in developed by Lesser for the simple derivation of rotational matrices relating different coordinate systems and for vector differentiation. Numerical solutions were computed in MATLAB. The results indicate a large load bearing in the conical contact surface between the mechanism’s <b>wobble</b> <b>plate</b> and engine block. The lateral force between piston and cylinder is small compared with that of a comparable machine with a conventional crank mechanism.   This study aims to predict contact loads and sliding velocities in the component interfaces. Such data are needed for bearing and component dimensioning and for selecting materials and coatings. Predicted contact loads together with contact geometries can also be used as input for tribological rig testing. Results from the model have been used to dimension the integral parts, bearings and materials of a physical demonstrator of the super-critical steam expander application as well as in component design and concept studies...|$|E
40|$|In a bus air {{conditioning}} system, the working load is relatively high {{in comparison to}} a passenger car. As such, {{the size of the}} compressor used is also relatively large due to high refrigerant flow rate required to meet the demand for high cooling capacity. For high refrigerant flow rate, reciprocating piston-cylinder concept has been known to operate successfully. The present work carried out is also based on the pistoncylinder compression concept but attempt was made {{to reduce the size of}} the compressor so that it is more compact and stable. This thesis reports the actual effort of introducing a novel concept of compression mechanism of the refrigerant compressor for a bus {{air conditioning}} system. The development of prototypes is based on experience and knowledge gained through reverse engineering on several existing compressor models in the market such as the swash plate compressor and the <b>wobble</b> <b>plate</b> compressor. Literature reviews were carried out to keep up with the latest technology that is available in the market and to acquire more state of the art knowledge required to design a better compressor. In parallel, an experimental rig was developed based on international standard to test and evaluate both existing and newly developed compressors. Tests were conducted by varying the compressor speed from 800 rpm to 1800 rpm. The performance of the compressors were studied in terms of coefficient of performance (COP), volumetric efficiency (v Î·) and mechanical efficiency (mech Î·). For the existing compressor model, the highest COP obtained was 4. 1 at 800 rpm while the highest volumetric and mechanical efficiencies are 71 % at 1400 rpm and 74 % at 800 rpm. Similar data were planned to be obtained from the test of the newly developed prototypes. However, the new prototypes were not fully developed and data obtained from the test carried out were not enough to make a conclusive comparison with the performance of the existing model. The compressor managed to get a pressure ratio of 3 which was enough for an air conditioning system to work. The shortfalls and the source of the failure have been identified and recommendations for improvement have been made...|$|E
40|$|Some typical {{applications}} where scuffing {{may occur}} are gear teeth, piston rings and cylinder pairs, cams and followers, splines, sleeve bearings, {{and parts of}} swash and <b>wobble</b> <b>plate</b> compressors. Unlike other tribology-related failures, scuffing occurs very fast, without any warning, and usually leads to the complete destruction of the sliding pair. Practical experience with steel has helped to outline safe ranges of operation for some components. Very little, however, is known about aluminum, which {{is the second most}} commonly used engineering metal. The aim {{of this study is to}} obtain a better understanding scuffing and seizure of aluminum/steel contacts. The research includes an experimental study of scuffing of aluminum/steel contacts under dry sliding conditions, a study of the physics of the scuffing process, evaluation of various hypotheses for scuffmg, and modeling of scuffing. The experiments are conducted in a custom-designed tribometer, which provides accurate control of the environmental conditions. Special instrumentation, experimental procedures and software are developed as a part of the experimental program. These provide a reliable reproduction and identification of scuffing under laboratory conditions. The scuffing characteristics of five materials are obtained in air and refrigerant (R 134 a) environments. The effects of load, sliding velocity, mechanical strength, environmental temperature, specimen geometry, time, loading history, and type of environment are evaluated. The mechanisms leading to scuffing are studied by examination of surfaces, subsurfaces and wear debris of specimens in the process of scuffing. Quantitative measurements of subsurface plastic strain are also obtained. The theoretical part of the study includes the development of a finite element model for the contact of runned-in rough surfaces and several other models for subsurface stresses, temperatures, and strains. These models provide information about the local conditions in the subsurface Based on the experimental observations and the scuffing models a new hypothesis for scuffing is proposed. According to this hypothesis, scuffing involves initiation of cracks due to subsurface plastic deformation, propagation of these cracks leading to the removal of the existing protective surface layers, and finally cold welding due to adhesion between bare metal surfaces.

40|$|The multi-piston axial {{reciprocating}} compressor using the Sanderson-Rocker Arm Motion (S-RAM) mechanism {{is expected to}} have less leakage from the cylinder to the shell space due to the vertical motion of the piston assembly in the cylinder. The main frictional power loss is located at the ball-socket joints connecting the piston with the <b>wobble</b> <b>plate</b> of the S-RAM mechanism. The stroke of the compressor can be changed by altering the inclined angle between the connecting shaft and machine driving shaft, to change the delivered refrigerant mass flow rate to match the capacity requirement in industry. ^ A comprehensive simulation model for a prototype {{reciprocating compressor}} using the S-RAM mechanism has been developed. The natural refrigerant carbon dioxide (CO 2) is used as the working fluid. The comprehensive model is comprised of a kinematics model, compression process model, dynamics model and an overall energy balance model. In the kinematics model, the movement of the piston is given including its displacement, velocity and acceleration. It is found that the moving path of the center of the ball in the ball-socket joint is moving around a corresponding cylinder centerline with a ‘figure 8 ’ motion instead of moving along the cylinder centerline. In the compression process model, the system of governing equations is solved, which incorporates a valve sub-model and a leakage sub-model. The variable step size RKF 45 method and Broyden’s method are employed to solve the non-linear system of equations to find the in-cylinder refrigerant state (instantaneous temperature and pressure) at each rotational angle of the machine driving shaft. The variations of suction and discharge valve movements with respect to driving shaft rotational angle are also given. The values of the cylinder wall temperature, the actual suction and discharge temperatures in the connecting pipes are required to initiate the solving of the compression process model. These temperatures are solved simultaneously by incorporating the overall energy balance model with the compression process model. A lumped temperature assumption is employed in the overall energy balance model to assume there is no temperature gradient in each compressor component at steady-state. The dynamics model, which focuses on the frictional power loss, runs based on the in-cylinder refrigerant pressure determined in the solution of the compression process model. ^ The presented modeling methodology is validated by modeling a conventional reciprocating piston compressor instead of the S-RAM compressor since there are no test data available for the prototype S-RAM compressor. The simulation model was updated to predict the performance of a conventional reciprocating compressor. Required modifications are made to account for the difference between these two compressors. The simulation results are validated using test data obtained from a hot-gas bypass test stand and the data from the published compressor map. ^ Using this validated methodology, the simulation results for the S-RAM compressor are given. Moreover, the effects of different parameters on the compressor performance are investigated in the parametric studies (such as the effect of the valve spring stiffness and the effect of stroke-to-bore ratio) so that proper parameters are chosen to optimize the compressor. ...|$|E
