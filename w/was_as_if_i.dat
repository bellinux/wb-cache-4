500|$|Jack Nicholson, {{recounting the}} {{reaction}} to a screening of the film, states that the audience [...] "laughed so hard I could barely hear the dialogue. I didn't quite register it right. It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had forgotten it was a comedy since the shoot. I got all embarrassed because I'd never really had such a positive response before." ...|$|E
500|$|The defence {{began to}} present its {{psychiatric}} {{evidence on the}} third day of the trial, 18 January 1967, when Yaworsky was called to testify on Lamb's behalf. Yaworsky recounted in detail his examination of the defendant two days after the shootings; he put weight on the fact that Lamb had laughed while incoherently describing the events of 25 June, and had at one point giggled and exclaimed [...] "poor [...] ", referring to Edith Chaykoski. So far Lamb had sat through the trial in muted silence, showing no emotion whatsoever, but when Yaworsky mentioned the boy's having [...] "giggled" [...] at this point of the 27 June interview, Lamb did so again in a similar manner. Yaworsky said that he had interviewed Lamb four more times between December 1966 and the trial, and that in these discussions the young man had been able to remember more about the incident; Lamb told Yaworsky that he remembered confronting the people in the street, but that everything had then [...] "felt fuzzy" [...] when he fired the gun. Yaworsky quoted Lamb: [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was invisible. ... The next clear memory I have is standing minutes later in the Heaton living room. All of a sudden, I was standing there with a gun in my hand—that is when I ran out." [...] The doctor hypothesised that this had been when Lamb returned to the real world following a psychopathic episode during which he had been divorced from reality. Dolan then testified along similar lines, describing his interview with Lamb two days after Yaworsky's and telling the court that he also believed that Lamb had been suffering a psychotic break that had made him unable to appreciate [...] "the nature and quality of the act of killing another human being".|$|E

It took {{me back to}} the way that I {{naturally}} was as a child growing up way in the country, rarely seeing people.

2500|$|At {{the time}} when Bukhari saw the earlier works and {{conveyed}} them, he found them, in their presentation, combining between what would be considered sahih (correct) and hasan (good) and {{that many of them}} included daʻīf (weak) hadith. This aroused his interest in compiling hadith whose authenticity was beyond doubt. What further strengthened his resolve was something his teacher, hadith scholar Ishaq ibn Ibrahim al-Hanthalee – better known as Ishaq Ibn Rahwayh – had told him. [...] "We were with Ishaq Ibn Rahwayh who said, ‘If only you would compile a book of only authentic narrations of the Prophet.’ This suggestion remained in my heart so I began compiling the Sahih." [...] Bukhari also said, [...] "I saw the Prophet in a dream and it <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{was standing in front of}} him. In my hand was a fan with which I was protecting him. I asked some dream interpreters, who said to me, ‘You will protect him from lies.’ This is what compelled me to produce the Sahih." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{never heard}} such sweet forbearing {{kindness}} {{expressed in a}} voice, as she expressed in making this reply. It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had seen her admiringly and tenderly embracing Dora, and tacitly reproving me, by her considerate protection, for my hot haste in fluttering that little heart. It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had seen Dora, in all her fascinating artlessness, caressing Agnes, and thanking her, and coaxingly appealing against me, and loving me with all her childish innocence.|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{is right}} {{that there should be}} schoolmasters, and missionaries, and all such men," [...] she replied.

6000|$|It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{had hung}} the picture before her, {{so that she}} had fairly to look at it. But the point that she first, in her effort, took up was not, superficially, the most salient. [...] "Mr. Long walked away?" ...|$|E

6000|$|The girl {{stared at}} her helplessly, trying to {{understand}} herself and her surroundings. There was, in truth, something singularly alien in her mother's attitude. She seemed on the defensive, not wishing to be too closely studied. [...] "Her manner is not even affectionate--only friendly.

60|$|But it did me good--that visit.

60|$|He glanced {{round the}} table, {{jumped up and}} with a word of excuse left the studio by a small door in a corner.

60|$|Recollections of that {{disastrous}} evening are clouded. So evil with dreams my nights {{had been}} that I hardly knew whether I was awake or asleep.

Marvell is behind me, and Adam Waggett is ducketing in the luminous distance. The clatter of many tongues beats on my ear. Mrs Monnerie murmurs and gently rocks. The great silver dishes dip and withdraw. Corks pop, and the fumes of meat and wine cloud into the air.
