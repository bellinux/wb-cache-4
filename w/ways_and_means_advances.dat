50|$|<b>Ways</b> <b>and</b> <b>means</b> <b>advances</b> (WMA) is a {{mechanism}} used by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) under its credit policy by which provides to the States banking {{with it to}} help them to tide over temporary mismatches in the cash flow of their receipts and payments. This is guided under Section 17(5) of RBI Act, 1934, and are '..repayable in each case not later than three months from the date of making that advance'.|$|E
50|$|Another {{problem was}} of the <b>ways</b> <b>and</b> <b>means</b> <b>advances.</b> To {{overcome}} the temporary difficulties faced by the state governments, the Reserve Bank of India provided this facility so that the states could balance their balance sheet and remain solvent. This was the extra debt {{that was to be}} cleared quickly. After the droughts and famines hit India, states had huge overdrafts year after year. Therefore it was recommended by the Planning commission that resources must first be set aside for meeting the deficits of the states and then help in enabling states to put the new resources into their plans. This was an effort towards bringing non plan and plan expenditures together. This has partially helped in solving the problem of artificial division of expenditures into plan and non-plan expenditures.|$|E

40|$|Results on long-run {{stability}} of M 1 and M 3 money multipliers in India are presented after the BoP crisis. Allowing for in-sample regime switching {{it is found}} that M 3 money multiplier can be characterized by a one-time regime shift around the beginning of 1997, the time when money markets reform first begun in a big way, with issuance of ad hoc 14 -day on tap T-Bills giving way to <b>Ways</b> <b>and</b> <b>Means</b> <b>Advances.</b> Results on the {{stability of}} M 1 multiplier are less clear and relationship, if it exists, is statistically weak.

50|$|The Committee of <b>Ways</b> <b>and</b> <b>Means</b> was {{abolished}} in 1967 and {{the responsibility}} for all fiscal matters, including taxation, now rests with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
