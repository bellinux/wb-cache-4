25|$|For {{most of the}} 20th century, collegiate wrestling was {{the most}} popular form of amateur wrestling in the country, {{especially}} in the Midwest and the Southwest. The 1960s and 1970s saw major developments in collegiate <b>wrestling,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> emergence of the United States Wrestling Federation (USWF) (now known as USA Wrestling (USAW)).

On August 6, TNA confirmed through their website that a deal had been signed, and afterwards interviews with Jones and Jeff Jarrett, one of TNA's Vice Presidents, indicated that he did intend to wrestle, primarily as part of a tag team.|$|E

While the decision cost O'Neill some support among older voters in his home district, he benefited from new support among students and faculty members at the many colleges and universities there. In the House of Representatives itself, O'Neill picked up the trust and support of younger House members who shared his antiwar views, and they became important friends who contributed to O'Neill's rise through the ranks in the House.|$|E

25|$|After a brief {{fall out}} with McMahon and WWE, Hogan was lured to Memphis <b>Wrestling</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{proposal}} of wrestling Jerry Lawler. The match had been promoted on Memphis Wrestling Prime Time for several months. On April 12, 2007, however, Lawler announced {{in a news}} conference that WWE had barred him from wrestling Hogan on the basis that NBC performers (including Lawler, on the basis of co-hosting the NBC-owned USA Network's Raw and his appearances on the biannual WWE's Saturday Night's Main Event) are contractually prohibited from appearing on VH1, the channel on which Hogan Knows Best airs. The situation resulted in a lawsuit being filed against WWE by event promoter Corey Maclin. Lawler was replaced with Paul Wight. Hogan defeated Wight at Memphis Wrestling's PMG Clash of Legends on April 27, 2007 when he picked up and hit a body slam on Wight before pinned him following his signature running leg drop.|$|E

However, Jacqueline, along with ODB, {{returned to}} Impact Wrestling on July 21, once again attacking Velvet Sky prior to her match with Mickie James for the TNA Women's Knockout Championship. They would eventually be attacked by the returning Traci Brooks, before being escorted out of the arena by police officers. On the August 18 edition of Impact Wrestling, Jacqueline and ODB changed their attitudes, abandoning their villainous antics, in order to first get contracts with the promotion. After several weeks of working as babyfaces, Jacqueline and ODB were signed to contracts by the new head of the Knockouts division, Karen Jarrett, on the September 1 edition of Impact Wrestling. However, Jacqueline would not make any more appearances, before announcing on November 28 that her TNA contract had expired.|$|E
25|$|Rob Donovan reads {{an article}} in the {{newspaper}} about Johnny at the factory. He then requests a visit from Tracy and tells his prison cellmate that he plans for revenge on Tracy and Carla of how they disowned him and how they called the police and had him jailed. Tracy turned up to visit Rob and wondered why he had chosen to contact her after such time, however Rob confessed to being angry at first but could never stop loving her and he did not blame her for him being arrested. After Tracy's visit, Rob requested a visit from Johnny, and reveals that he is the father of Carla. He demands £10,000 from Johnny to keep it secret. Johnny told him that Tracy was with Robert Preston. Johnny does everything in his power to ensure that nobody finds out, but steals some of Carla's DNA to perform a paternity test behind her back. Rob then sent a visiting order to Robert. He told him about Tracy wanting to start a new relationship with him. Robert was disgusted and stormed out. He then split up with Tracy. Rob reveals to Tracy that everything was a lie and that he still hated her. Johnny reveals all to a disgusted Carla. Carla is furious, however Johnny continues to plead with Carla not to tell Aidan and Kate. Carla Sleeps with Robert. She instantly regrets it, and confides in Michelle, who attempts to persuade Carla not to tell Nick. Carla continues to threaten to tell Johnny's children the truth unless he moves away, which he does not. Carla reveals that she is their half-sister to Kate and Aidan, who are distraught. Carla is shocked to find that Robert plans to buy a share in the Bistro. Carla begs him to reconsider, but Robert threatens to reveal their affair to Nick if she does not let him buy into the Bistro. Carla finds it increasingly difficult to keep her deceit under wraps. She also begins bonding with Kate. Carla tells Nick that she cannot marry him, but changes her mind. Upon hearing that Robert is intending on going into business with Nick, Carla goes to the bistro to confront him. Carla and Robert engage in a bitter argument, with their one-night stand being mentioned. Tracy, who has recently reconciled with Robert, has overheard their conversation. Robert then leaves, and Carla drowns her sorrows. However, Jamie Bowman (James Atherton), and his friend, Lee, burst into the restaurant and violently attack Carla. Tracy, hearing the commotion, leaves Carla to the mercy of the thugs, feeling envious over Carla's liaison with Robert. After realising that there is no money in the restaurant, Jamie grabs Carla's handbag, causing her to fall over. She rises to her feet abruptly and gives chase. She jumps into the car, leaving the door wide open, <b>wrestling</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> thugs for her handbag.

500|$|Johnson {{was a clear}} {{favourite}} to win the match, {{which took}} place on 17 January 1791 and attracted even more spectators than had been present for the Perrins fight. He had Joe Ward as his second and Mendoza as his bottle holder, with those roles for Bryan being filled by Warr and Humphries. The brutality of the initial fighting was shared by both men. Johnson's nerve failed him, as did his command of the techniques that had served him well. O'Hara describes that he fought [...] "like a wild man" [...] and, throwing caution to the wind, broke a metacarpal in his middle finger after the momentum created by throwing a wild punch caused him to crash into the ring rail {{and then to the}} floor. This was the turning point, and O'Hara describes the situation as, [...] "Frightfully beaten, his fists useless, his eyes closed, bathed in blood, and without the chance even of turning the tide with a lucky punch, he refuses to surrender." [...] He had to resort to shifting once more and eventually to <b>wrestling</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> hair of Bryan, which generated much disapprobation among the crowd. Eventually Bryan forced Johnson to the floor and beat him unconscious. Johnson had lost the fight, and his status as champion, in 21minutes. Egan speculated that Johnson's change in style, evident from the outset of the fight might have been due to either genuine concern about Bryan's abilities or from his gambling problems; either way, [...] "there was a miserable falling off in him altogether!" ...|$|E

500|$|While some reviewers {{regard the}} novel as a thriller, others {{see it as an}} example of post-millennial science fiction with stories set in the [...] "technocultural future-present". Some reviewers note that the novel furthers the post-millennial trend in science fiction of {{illustrating}} society's inability to imagine a definitive future and the use of technologies once considered advanced or academic now commonplace within society and its vernacular. Gibson said that the only science fiction elements are [...] "he Footage and Cayce's special talents" [...] but that he [...] "never bought that conceit that science fiction is about the future". Dennis Danvers explained the use of science fiction as a narrative strategy: cience fiction, in effect, has become a narrative strategy, a way of approaching story, in which not only characters must be invented, but the world and its ways as well, without resorting to magic or the supernatural, where the fantasy folks work. A realist <b>wrestling</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> woes of the middle class can leave the world out of it by and large except for an occasional swipe at the shallowness of suburbia. A science fiction writer must invent the world where the story takes place, often from the ground up, a process usually called world-building. In other words, in a science fiction novel, the world itself is a distinctive and crucial character in the plot, without whom the story could not take place, whether it's the world of Dune or Neuromancer or 1984. The world is the story as much as the story is in the world. Part of Gibson's point ... is {{that we live in a}} time of such accelerated change and layered realities, that we're all in that boat, like it or not. A novel set in the [...] "real world" [...] now has to answer the question, [...] "Which one?" ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewing {{the first}} seven episodes, Brian Lowry of Variety said, the season begins [...] "on an uneven note", {{comparing}} {{some of the early}} moments to the works of Sam Peckinpah, [...] "complete with slow-motion bullets and blood sprays. Stick with it, though, and the show blossoms, featuring a few terrific action sequences while introducing into this grim world seminal characters the Punisher and Elektra." [...] Kevin Fitzpatrick of Screen Crush felt {{the first seven}} episodes of the season seemed [...] "to have learned the best of both" [...] from season one and Jessica Jones, [...] "placing its most compelling imagery front and center straightaway, but still taking time to pick apart the characters beneath them, rather than shout platitudes about saving the city." [...] He also praised the castings of Bernthal and Yung as Punisher and Elektra, respectively, and enjoyed [...] "the improved spotlight" [...] for Foggy and Karen, given the reduction of Dawson saying, [...] "So many superhero series struggle to draw its supporting characters as compellingly as the action, and Daredevils particular blend of set piece and legal thriller feels inescapably original." [...] However, Fitzpatrick did note the series lacked the presence Vondie Curtis-Hall brought as Ben Urich in the first season. He concluded that the season's progression [...] "feels much cleaner" [...] than the first's, [...] "moving almost in acts more than back and forth victories...Even the aim feels that much more cohesive, to start in a place of Matt, Foggy and Karen all confident in their new roles, but <b>wrestling</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> consequence of their choice to always help the helpless." [...] Merrill Barr of Forbes said, [...] "Daredevil season two is very much the same excellent show Daredevil season one was...but in the places it isn’t, it’s also very much improved". Barr praised Bernthal as the Punisher, and noted the reduction in the amount of [...] "thick blacks" [...] in the cinematography that the first season was criticized for.|$|E
