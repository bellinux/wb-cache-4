5|$|Decapitation was the {{preferred}} method in German and western Slavic areas, {{with the head}} buried between the feet, behind the buttocks or away from the body. This act {{was seen as a}} way of hastening the departure of the soul, <b>which</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> cultures, was said to linger in the corpse. The vampire's head, body, or clothes could also be spiked and pinned to the earth to prevent rising.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of Muslims {{in the country}} are adherents of a moderate branch of mystical Islam (Sufism). Its most common expression is the Tijaniyah, an order followed by the 35% of Chadian Muslims which incorporates some local African religious elements. A small minority of the country's Muslims hold more fundamentalist practices, <b>which,</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> cases, may be associated with Saudi-oriented Salafi movements.|$|E
5|$|The {{names of}} the {{individual}} islands reflect a complex linguistic history.

5|$|The size of {{the heart}} varies among the {{different}} animal groups, with hearts in vertebrates ranging {{from those of the}} smallest mice (12mg) to the blue whale (600kg).

5|$|Chamberlain {{sought the}} {{abolition}} of the elected Poor Law Boards of Guardians, which administered relief and <b>which</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> areas were responsible for rates. Many of the Boards were controlled by Labour, and had defied the Government by distributing relief funds to the able-bodied unemployed. Chamberlain's first step in the direction of abolition was the Rating and Valuation Act 1925, which greatly reduced the number of authorities which administered rates, as well as imposing uniform standards for assessment. Despite policy differences Chamberlain continued to work with Churchill, who showed him the manuscript of a volume of his heavily autobiographical The World Crisis. Churchill confided that he would have wished for two more years to revise the manuscript; Chamberlain wrote to his sisters that he could have done the job in two hours—with a pair of scissors.|$|E

5|$|Communities such as AVEN can be {{beneficial}} to those in search of answers to solve a crisis of identity {{with regard to their}} possible asexuality. Individuals go through a series of emotional processes that end with their identifying with the asexual community. They first realize that their sexual attractions differ from those of most of society. This difference leads to questioning whether the way they feel is acceptable, and possible reasons for why they feel this way. Pathological beliefs tend to follow, in <b>which,</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> cases, they may seek medical help because they feel they have a disease. Self-understanding is usually reached when they find a definition that matches their feelings. Asexuality communities provide support and information that allows newly identified asexuals to move from self-clarification to identifying on a communal level, which can be empowering, because they now have something to associate with, which gives normality to this overall socially-isolating situation.|$|E
5|$|Over 160 {{structures}} {{have been}} mapped at Iximche. The structures {{were faced with}} stone blocks that were coated in lime plaster, <b>which</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> cases was then painted with Mixtec-Puebla style murals, although few traces of the murals survive today. The Mixtec-Puebla style originated around AD 900 in central Mexico and spread from there throughout Mesoamerica. The superstructures of buildings at Iximche were built from adobe blocks and once supported beam and mortar roofs but none have survived. The platform cores were generally built of rough stones set in a clay matrix. A few of the structures have been restored and the site core is kept clear of overgrowth. Residential structures built on platforms around the ceremonial plazas usually had built-in benches and hearths.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} a meter that tracks Mustafa's hope. As he completes tasks that take him towards {{the goal of}} escaping, the meter increases. Listening to the {{experiences}} of fellow detainees, <b>which</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> cases is required {{to gain access to}} other information or tasks, drains Mustafa's hope. If he is caught breaking rules by the guards, Mustafa is placed in solitary confinement, which also drains hope. Should the hope meter run out, Mustafa loses the ability to continue to attempt an escape, and is deported.|$|E

5|$|The script {{calls for}} five actors to portray ten {{characters}}. The two main characters are Jason, a young Canadian lawyer; and Number 18, a young female prostitute {{who claims to}} be fifteen years old {{and has been a}} prostitute for six years. The drama centers on Jason's infiltration of a brothel ring that is trafficking girls into Bangkok. Jason comes to believe that Number 18 could be a key witness to a human trafficking incident and tries to gain her trust and persuade her to testify against the ring. The victimized child in the play is known only by the number 18 to reflect how traffickers often dehumanize their victims by giving them a new name or simply a number, <b>which</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> cases is branded onto the victim's body. Waldschmidt said he hoped that She Has a Name will educate Canadians about human trafficking and motivate them to act on what they learn, thereby turning them into anti-sexual slavery activists.|$|E
5|$|The undulating garland motif {{against a}} black {{background}} {{found in the}} masonry-style mural paintings at Delos were also featured in earlier Greek works of art ranging from vases to 4th-century-BC Macedonian mosaics of Pella, particularly the Stag Hunt Mosaic. However, the painters of Delos arguably invented their own decorative genre {{using a combination of}} these older elements with new naturalistic coloring. Aside from the black background, mosaics like the Stag Hunt Mosaic were also inspired by the illusionist, three-dimensional qualities of Greek paintings. At Delos, paintings and mosaics inherited the same Classical Greek standards of craftsmanship, lighting, shading, and coloring. Sculptors, painters, and mosaic artists may have all been part of the same system of patronage at Delos, <b>which</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> instances would have necessitated the importation of foreign artists.|$|E
5|$|Within {{two weeks}} of his {{appointment}} as Minister of Health Chamberlain presented the Cabinet with an agenda containing 25 pieces of legislation he hoped to see enacted. Before he left office in 1929, 21 of the 25 bills had passed into law. Chamberlain sought {{the abolition of the}} elected Poor Law Boards of Guardians which administered relief—and <b>which</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> areas were responsible for rates. Many of the Boards were controlled by Labour, and such Boards had defied the government by distributing relief funds to the able-bodied unemployed. In 1929 Chamberlain initiated legislation to abolish the Poor Law boards entirely. Chamberlain spoke in the Commons {{for two and a half}} hours on the second reading of the Bill, and when he concluded he was applauded by all parties. The Bill passed into law.|$|E
