5|$|Applying the {{categorical}} imperative, duties arise because {{failure to}} fulfil them <b>would</b> <b>either</b> {{result in a}} contradiction in conception or in a contradiction in the will. The former are classified as perfect duties, the latter as imperfect. A perfect duty always holds true—there is a perfect duty to tell the truth, so we must never lie. An imperfect duty allows flexibility—beneficence is an imperfect duty {{because we are not}} obliged to be completely beneficent at all times, but may choose the times and places in which we are. Kant believed that perfect duties are more important than imperfect duties: if a conflict between duties arises, the perfect duty must be followed.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} NFF awarded an annual license to clubs which {{permitted}} {{them to play}} in the top two divisions. This included a series of criteria that the home venue needed to meet. As Briskeby was severely substandard to the criteria, Ham-Kam was required to apply for annual exemptions. These were only awarded to clubs who were actively working on upgrading or building new venues. If an exception was not granted, the club <b>would</b> <b>either</b> be relegated to the Second Division (the third tier), or would have to play their home games at an approved stadium in another town.|$|E
5|$|For a {{relatively}} small fee, entrance could be gained by {{any member of the}} general public to the Bath complex. While the area was obviously primarily used for public bathing, one could exercise and enjoy a variety of recreational activities. Attendants were paid to oversee these activities, and the happenings of the complex, enforcing opening and closing times, and the rules of conduct. Men and women were not allowed to bathe together; they <b>would</b> <b>either</b> be in separate baths, or bathe at different times of the day.|$|E

5|$|Keene died {{at home on}} January 13, 2009, aged 85, from a {{respiratory}} condition. After her death, the Homer {{city council}} passed a new resolution banning the feeding of eagles, crows, ravens and other predatory and scavenger birds by any person, effective March 19, 2009. The resolution's effective date was delayed until spring out of concern that the birds <b>would</b> <b>either</b> die of starvation or become highly aggressive if the feeding ended {{in the middle of}} winter. A memorial to Keene is planned at a nearby hotel that was a favorite dining spot of Keene's and supplied much of her fish.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of Nødnett, Norway had three separate systems for telecommunications within the police, fire departments and paramedics, all based on analog radio. The old system had two main downsides: it was not encrypted, and it prevented communication between agencies. This was particularly problematic in larger disasters and accidents, and in instances where criminals listened to the police radio during police actions. The Norwegian Data Inspectorate had also instructed the agencies to encrypt their communications for reasons of privacy. This <b>would</b> <b>either</b> have to be done through an expensive upgrade to the existing systems, or through the construction of a new, digital network.|$|E
5|$|The NHC {{noted that}} a trough ahead of Christine would {{determine}} {{the future of the}} storm. This trough <b>would</b> <b>either</b> merge with the storm and allow significant intensification, or remain separate and cause Christine to dissipate. By September3, the low-level circulation had been displaced from all convective activity and Christine weakened to a tropical depression. Several hours after weakening, the depression passed over Antigua with winds of 35mph (55km/h). The following day, the system degenerated into a tropical wave near the northeastern coast of the Dominican Republic. The remnants of Christine were monitored by the NHC for several days before dissipating near the trough on September6.|$|E

5|$|The {{aggressive}} Weyrother persuaded Archduke John and Lauer {{to launch}} an offensive. The Austrian chief of staff planned to strike {{in the direction of}} Landshut. From there, the Austrians <b>would</b> <b>either</b> wheel left to smash the French left flank or possibly get across their enemies' line of communications to the west of Munich. However, in the last days of November, the Austrian army proved unable to advance with the necessary speed to turn the French north flank. Aware that their adversaries were also advancing, Lauer convinced the archduke to convert the flank march into a direct advance on Munich.|$|E
5|$|The c.1800 {{manuscript}} related {{that the}} spell of the banner meant that it would vanish when it was displayed for the third time. The final unfurling of the banner <b>would</b> <b>either</b> gain the clan a complete victory over their enemies or meant that the clan was to suffer total extinction. The writer of the c.1800 manuscript went on to state that the temptation for unfurling the flag for {{the third and final}} time was always resisted; and {{that at the time of}} his writing, there was not much chance of it ever being unfurled again, since it was in such a reduced state. The writer stated that of the few shreds that remained, he himself possessed a fragment.|$|E
5|$|The {{closing of}} the Oslo–Stockholm service {{was the first time}} there was not a train service between the capitals since 1871, when the line opened. In addition, the service cut {{occurred}} {{at the same time as}} the centennial of the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden. On 4 November, SJ and NSB stated that they would continue the service, but only on weekends. They stated that an increased service <b>would</b> <b>either</b> require financial grants from the states, or introduction of duty-free sales on board.|$|E

5|$|The rituals {{performed}} at the statue by pregnant women involved walking round three times, reciting charms and touching one's abdomen. Women would also carry a band which <b>would</b> <b>either</b> be touched to the statue and then tied around their waist, or half of the band would be tied to the statue while the remaining half would be kept on the woman's body until the child was born. After the childbirth, the basin {{in front of the}} statue was used by women to bathe in. The rites performed in the honour of the statue were said to be similar to those performed by Phoenicians in the worship of their Venus.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{agreed with}} Blount's report, which found the populace to {{be opposed to}} annexation. Liliuokalani {{initially}} refused to grant amnesty {{as a condition of}} her reinstatement, saying that she <b>would</b> <b>either</b> execute or banish the current government in Honolulu, but Dole's government refused to yield their position. By December 1893, the matter was still unresolved, and Cleveland referred the issue to Congress. In his message to Congress, Cleveland rejected the idea of annexation and encouraged the Congress to continue the American tradition of non-intervention (see excerpt at right). The Senate, under Democratic control but opposed to Cleveland, commissioned and produced the Morgan Report, which contradicted Blount's findings and found the overthrow was a completely internal affair. Cleveland dropped all talk of reinstating the Queen, and went on to recognize and maintain diplomatic relations with the new Republic of Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|However, as {{the fifth}} season's {{production}} period entered its final months, rumors began to circulate – {{especially among the}} production crew members in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada – {{about the future of}} the series, particularly concerning whether the show would be moving to Los Angeles, California for the sixth season and whether the new recurring character of Jeffrey Spender was planned (in case David Duchovny cut back his commitment to the series) to become a replacement for Duchovny's character of Fox Mulder – either as a part-time or full-fledged substitute. Other, contradictory rumors that Owens heard were that either he or Duchovny would appear in only eight episodes of the sixth season and that his casting as Spender was a sign that the series <b>would</b> <b>either</b> be leaving Vancouver or staying there. According to the actor himself, he always knew that Duchovny would not be leaving the series but only discovered that The X-Files would indeed be moving to Los Angeles when the official announcement was made.|$|E

5|$|In 1974 RobertA.Martin {{proposed}} that the large North American wolf C.armbrusteri (Armbruster's wolf) was C.lupus. Nowak, Kurten, and Annalisa Berta {{proposed that}} C.dirus was not derived from C.lupus. In 1987, a new hypothesis proposed that a mammal population could {{give rise to a}} larger form called a hypermorph during times when food was abundant, but when food later became scarce the hypermorph <b>would</b> <b>either</b> adapt to a smaller form or go extinct. This hypothesis might explain the large body sizes found in many Late Pleistocene mammals compared to their modern counterparts. Both extinction and speciationa process by which a new species splits from an older onecould occur together during periods of climatic extremes. Gloria D. Goulet agreed with Martin, proposing further that this hypothesis might explain the sudden appearance of C.dirus in North America and, judging from the similarities in their skull shapes, that C.lupus had given rise to the C.dirus hypermorph due to an abundance of game, a stable environment, and large competitors.|$|E
5|$|On January 4, 2017, {{the office}} of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo {{announced}} a plan to renovate the entire airport {{at a cost of}} $7–10 billion. As part of the project, the AirTrain JFK <b>would</b> <b>either</b> see lengthened trainsets or a direct track connection to the rest of New York City's transportation system. There would also be a rebuilding the Jamaica station so that there is a direct connection to the Long Island Rail Road and New York City Subway. There is no proposed start date for the overhaul. Shortly after Cuomo's announcement, the Regional Plan Association published a study in which it studied a possible direct rail link from Manhattan. In July 2017, Cuomo's office began accepting proposals for master plans to renovate the airport.|$|E
5|$|Other {{than its}} use in the kulintang ensemble, the agung also had other non-ensemble uses among the Maguindanao and Maranao. The agung {{has been used to}} warn others of {{impending}} danger, announcing the time of day and other important occasions. For instance, long ago the sultan would beat the agung repeatedly to announce the onset of a meeting or during the fasting month of Ramadhan, the agung would ring either {{at three in the morning}} to indicate the signal to eat (sawl) or at sunset, to mark the end for fasting that day. And supposedly due to the deep, loud sound the agung produces, people believed that it possessed supernatural powers. For instance, during an earthquake, the locals of Maguindanao would strike the agung in a fast, loud rhythm called baru-baru, believing its vibrations <b>would</b> <b>either</b> lessen or even halt the jolt of an earthquake.|$|E

25|$|The draft EIS {{included}} 12 different study corridor alternatives {{by choosing}} among four variations along the route. The first variation, from Laredo to southeast of San Antonio, <b>would</b> have included <b>either</b> the current I-35 alignment until curving {{off to the}} east at a point south of San Antonio or would have followed a more direct route to the east. The study area for all alternatives continued northeast, paralleling I-35. The second variation <b>would</b> have <b>either</b> passed just {{to the east of}} the municipal boundaries along I-35 from Austin to Temple or further east. The third variation <b>would</b> have passed <b>either</b> to the west of Fort Worth or east of Dallas. The fourth variation was dependent on the eastern third variation and <b>would</b> have <b>either</b> rejoined the western third variation near the Oklahoma border or would have ended at the Oklahoma border near U.S. Highway 75. The draft EIS designated a recommended preferred alternative corridor running to the east of I-35 and I-35E from near Gainesville to south of San Antonio, where the corridor would join I-35 to run south to Laredo.|$|R
