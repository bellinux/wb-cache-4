Suppose we parallel transport the vector first along the equator until at point P and then (keeping it parallel to itself) drag it along a meridian to the pole N and (keeping the direction there) subsequently transport it along another meridian back to Q. Then <b>we</b> <b>notice</b> that the parallel-transported vector along a closed circuit does not return as the same vector; instead, it has another orientation. This would not happen in Euclidean space and {{is caused by the}} curvature of the surface of the globe. The same effect can be noticed if we drag the vector along an infinitesimally small closed surface subsequently along two directions and then back. The infinitesimal change of the vector {{is a measure of the}} curvature.|$|E
500|$|Central to the {{promotion}} was the limiting {{of exposure to}} the album's content, as well as a focus on face-to-face contact for press previews. As Hahn stated, [...] "There is a minimalism in our approach that creates an absence of information, and <b>we</b> <b>notice</b> our fans tend to throw themselves into the breach, or try to fill the empty spaces." [...] The album's track titles were initially withheld from online retailers and later revealed through Columbia's Vine account on 16 April 2013 as a video relaying a series of images. Following a reported leak of the song days earlier, [...] "Get Lucky" [...] was released as a digital download single on 19 April 2013. On 13 May, Daft Punk's official Vevo channel posted a video revealing the artwork packaging of the vinyl version of the album, as well as the first few seconds of the opening track. Later that day, a limited-time preview stream of the full album was launched via the iTunes Store.|$|E
500|$|Dan Martin for NME {{felt that}} [...] "Love Without Tragedy / Mother Mary" [...] could {{possibly}} be the best song on Unapologetic, writing that it moves Rihanna into a [...] "new sonic and emotional space" [...] due to its confessional feel. Billboard named it [...] "a deeply personal song sold by Rihanna's uplifting vocal." [...] Chris Youine for 4Music compared the song's musicality {{to the work of}} English rock band The Police and Sting, describing its composition as [...] "instantly likable and clever". Younie concurred with Martin on the subject of Rihanna's extreme confessionalism, and wrote that it is very personal. Greg Kot for Chicago Tribune thought that [...] "Love Without Tragedy / Mother Mary" [...] was Unapologetics [...] "emotional centerpiece". Stacy-Ann Ellis of Vibe agreed, calling it [...] "the most autobiographical seven minutes on Unapologetic. It’s almost too raw in its intimacy." [...] Ellis added: [...] "It’s here <b>we</b> <b>notice</b> Rihanna’s life could be the basis of a Shakespearean play. During its intentionally abrupt tonal transition, the honesty becomes devastating." [...] Spins Caryn Ganz compared [...] "Love Without Tragedy / Mother Mary" [...] to [...] "Message in a Bottle" [...] (1979) by The Police and wrote that on the song Rihanna sounds as both [...] "a petulant teen and a world-weary woman". Dan Stern for MTV Buzzworthy felt that Rihanna was channeling Madonna {{the second part of the}} song, [...] "Mother Mary".|$|E

2500|$|Now {{assume that}} S and S are Riemann surfaces, {{and that the}} map π is complex analytic. [...] The map π {{is said to be}} {{ramified}} at a point P in S if there exist analytic coordinates near P and π(P) such that π takes the form π(z) = z'n, and n>1. [...] An equivalent way of thinking about this is that there exists a small neighborhood U of P such that π(P) has exactly one preimage in U, but the image of any other point in U has exactly n preimages in U. [...] The number n is called the ramification index at P and also denoted by e'P. [...] In calculating the Euler characteristic of S <b>we</b> <b>notice</b> the loss of eP1 copies of P above π(P) (that is, in the inverse image of π(P)). Now let us choose triangulations of S and S with vertices at the branch and ramification points, respectively, and use these to compute the Euler characteristics.

2500|$|The prayer [...] "Hanc igitur" [...] {{has some}} difficulties. The Greek version adds a rubric before it: [...] "Here he names the dead". What can the [...] "Hanc igitur" [...] {{have to do}} with the dead? The Antiochene Liturgy, in which several {{parallel}} passages to the modern Canon have already been noticed, has a parallel to the second half of this prayer too, and that parallel occurs in its commemoration of the dead. There, following a prayer that the dead may rest [...] "in the land of the living, in thy kingdom [...] [...] [...] in the bosom of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob", etc., is found this continuation: [...] "And keep for us in peace, O Lord, a Christian, well-pleasing and sinless end to our lives, gathering us under the feet of thy Elect, when Thou willest and as Thou willest, only without shame and offence; through thy only begotten Son our Lord and God and Saviour, Jesus Christ." [...] <b>We</b> <b>notice</b> here the reference to the elect (in electorum tuorum grege), the prayer that we may be kept [...] "in peace" [...] (in tuâ pace disponas), the allusion to the [...] "end of our lives" [...] (diesque nostros) and the unusual [...] "Per Christum Dominum nostrum", making a break in the middle of the Eucharistic prayer. The Syrian form with its plain reference to death ("the end of our lives") seems more clearly to be a continuation of a prayer for the faithful departed. But in the Roman form too is found such a reference in the words about hell (ab æterna damnatione) and heaven (in electorum tuorum grege).|$|E

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{occurrence}} of behavioural changes in chimpanzees whilst adding gaming aids to their living environment. At {{the beginning of the}} study, we encounter the spread of pneumonia in the Ljubljana zoo, where two younger chimpanzees and adult females lost their lives. The study included three female chimpanzees. After this tragic event we took a break in our research to give the chimpanzees some time to recover. We began recording a month later. After six months of observation, <b>we</b> <b>noticed</b> some positive changes in their behaviour. <b>We</b> <b>noticed</b> that the number of abnormal behaviours significantly reduced in all three females. The interaction between the chimpanzees and visitors of the ZOO decreased. <b>We</b> also <b>noticed</b> a reduced interaction between female chimpanzees. Aggressive behaviour of the chimpanzees during our observations was not noticed. During the whole process of observation <b>we</b> <b>noticed</b> that each of the observed female chimpanzees had its own desired set of gaming aids. Mojca, the oldest of the observed female chimpanzees, was especially attracted to games with manipulative and unusual combinations of game play. Neža and Nika were more intrigued by games (usually a set of obstacles) which promised a food treat after getting {{to the end of the}} game (overcoming the obstacles). During the observation <b>we</b> <b>noticed</b> some unexpected defensive behaviour, which might be the result of the negative relationship of the chimpanzees towards the presumptuous visitors.
