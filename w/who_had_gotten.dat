5|$|The {{music for}} Uru: Ages Beyond Myst and Myst V: End of Ages was {{composed}} by Tim Larkin, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> {{involved in the}} series doing sound design for Riven. Larkin stepped away from his background as a jazz composer and musician to create music with less structure and without a definite beginning and end. Larkin created different music depending on the location, giving each setting and Age a distinctive tone. For End of Ages, Larkin was unable to afford a full orchestra to perform his score, so he combined individual instrumentation {{with an array of}} synthesizers.|$|E
5|$|Following Dana's murder, {{the killer}} uses her {{cellphone}} {{to call the}} girls. Figuring out that something is wrong, they go outside to look for her. There, they discover Eve's decapitated head inside her car. Realizing there is a killer out there, Kelli calls 9-1-1, {{only to be told}} that due to the snowstorm, help would be unavailable for at least two hours. When their housemother Mrs. Mac and Heather decide to take the car and reach the police station on their own, Kelli, Leigh and Melissa all go to Lauren's room to see them through their window and make sure they leave safely. Noticing that the car has started but they're not leaving, Kelli and Leigh go to check on them through the basement where Leigh slips on Mrs. Mac's blood, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> killed by a falling icicle. Going back to Lauren's room, after a quick confrontation between Leigh and Kyle, they realize that Lauren has also been killed and despite protest from Kyle, decide to go to the attic in case any of the girls are still alive.|$|E
5|$|Taylor and his Secretary of State, John M. Clayton, both lacked {{diplomatic}} experience, {{and came}} into office at a relatively uneventful time in American–international politics. Their shared nationalism allowed Taylor to devolve foreign policy matters to Clayton with minimal oversight, although no decisive foreign policy was established under their administration. As opponents of the autocratic European order, they vocally supported German and Hungarian liberals in the revolutions of 1848, although they offered {{little in the way}} of aid. A perceived insult from the French minister Guillaume Tell Poussin nearly led to a break in diplomatic relations until Poussin was replaced, and a reparation dispute with Portugal resulted in harsh words from the Taylor administration. In a more positive effort, the administration arranged for two ships to assist in the United Kingdom's search for a team of British explorers, led by John Franklin, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> lost in the Arctic. While previous Whig administrations had emphasized Pacific trade as an economic imperative, the Taylor administration took no major initiative in the Far East.|$|E

25|$|In March 1903, the New York Times {{noted that}} the Vonnohs were two of a dozen {{painters}} and sculptors <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> {{together to create a}} building specifically for their studios, at 27 West Sixty-Seventh Street in Manhattan. In mid-1903, the Vonnohs began summering in Old Lyme, Connecticut, and became long-time members of its Old Lyme Art Colony.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Gage {{used every}} {{opportunity}} to defame Rogers, portraying him as an opportunist <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> rich on the war only to gamble away his money as a profligate. It {{is difficult to say}} how many of these allegations were true and how much Gage believed them to be true. Gage apparently saw Rogers as of questionable loyalty—certainly he was not loyal to Gage—and therefore he needed watching. Rogers' dealings with the American Indians troubled Gage, as he and many other British officers in America had come to regard the Indians as treacherous vermin.|$|E

He found some missing Boy Scouts from Long Island <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> separated from their group, a short distance from the tower at the lean-to near {{the south end of the}} summit. That coincided with the beginning of the end of the era in which the fire towers were an essential component of the region's fire control system. Since the 1950s, better public education about the causes of forest fires, along with improved local fire departments, had led to a decline in fires. Aerial observers, who could cover the whole region several times a day, were becoming a more cost-effective way to detect fires, and the state slowly began closing the towers down and dismantling them.|$|E
25|$|Boas's {{stance against}} spying {{took place in}} the context of his {{struggle}} to establish a new model for academic anthropology at Columbia University. Previously, American anthropology was based at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington and the Peabody Museum at Harvard, and these anthropologists competed with Boas's students for control over the American Anthropological Association (and its flagship publication American Anthropologist). When the National Academy of Sciences established the National Research Council in 1916 as a means by which scientists could assist the United States government prepare for entry into the war in Europe, competition between the two groups intensified. Boas's rival, W.H. Holmes (<b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> the job of Director at the Field Museum for which Boas had been passed over 26 years earlier), was appointed to head the NRC; Morley was a protégé of Holmes.|$|E
25|$|After the {{discovery}} at Manson's Creek in July of '71, more large strikes {{were made on}} nearby creeks. Among these were Blackjack Creek, Kildare Creek, Mosquito Creek, Slate Creek and Nugget Gulch. One of this richest creeks was found by accident by James Carson, H. Guest and J Griffith, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> lost while looking for Manson's Creek and literally stumbled across it, thus they called it Lost Creek. The very first panful taken from Lost Creek yielded 3/4 of an ounce of gold. With all these new strikes in the district, new towns sprang up practically overnight: Manson's Creek, Howellton and Dunkeld. The residence of the Gold Commissioner's would be built at Dunkeld. There would be three Gold Commissioners for the Omineca district in the 1870s and they were, Peter O'Reilly, WH Fitzgerald and D. Ballentyne, who would also act as Stipendary Magistrates.|$|E

25|$|Hoad {{started the}} 1955 season {{on a low}} note when {{he was unable to}} play the South Australian tennis {{championship}} in early January due to a torn ligament. To some surprise he entered the mixed doubles event at the 1955 Australian Championships with his girlfriend Jenny Staley and the pair finished as runner-ups to Thelma Coyne Long and George Worthington. In the singles event Hoad reached his first Grand Slam tournament final after solid wins over Seixas (quarterfinal) and Hartwig (semifinal). In the final Rosewall's accuracy and control, however, were too strong for him and he lost in three straight sets. Hoad did not participate in the 1955 French Championships as the Davis Cup team that he was part of only left for Europe at the end of May during the Championships. In the singles final of the Queen's Club Championship in mid-June Hoad, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> married earlier that day, lost his service seven times and lost to Rosewall in two straight sets but won the doubles event with Hartwig. Hoad was the fourth-seeded player at the Wimbledon Championships at the end of June. In his quarterfinal match against seventh-seeded Budge Patty his game lacked accuracy and he conceded a break in each set resulting in a loss in straight sets. Hoad was the second-seeded foreign player at the U.S. Championships in September held on the muddy courts of Forest Hills. In the quarterfinal he lost his service three times in succession in the third set and suffered a straight sets defeat in 50 minutes against Trabert, the first-seeded U.S. player, and eventual champion. Having lost the Davis Cup in 1954 Australia had to play through the 1955 Davis Cup preliminary rounds to challenge holders United States. In July Australia defeated Mexico, Brazil and Canada to win the Americas Zone and subsequently beat Japan and Italy in the Inter-zone matches in August. In the Challenge Round, played at the West Side Tennis Club, Forest Hills from 26 – 28 August, Hoad defeated the French and Wimbledon champion Trabert in four sets in his first singles rubber and with Hartwig won the doubles match to reclaim the cup for Australia. In his first significant tournament after the Davis Cup Hoad won the New South Wales Championships in November after a win in the final against Rosewall. In December he added the singles title at the Victorian Championships after a tough five-sets final win over 19-year old Ashley Cooper. At {{the end of the year}} he was ranked No. 3 in the world.|$|E
500|$|The team {{finished}} in seventh place (71-83) in 1958, the club's first season after moving from Brooklyn to Los Angeles. Criticism of Alston {{had begun to}} mount during that season, but he led the Dodgers to a world championship in 1959. Six players on the 1959 team finished with double-digit totals in home runs, while 22-year-old Don Drysdale led the team's pitchers with 17 wins. Several Los Angeles players, including Wally Moon, characterized Alston as indecisive in the late 1950s and 1960s. However, Moon later came to describe Alston as a good manager <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> [...] "good mileage" [...] out of his players.|$|E
500|$|Casting {{negotiations}} for the film's main roles—played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Aaron Paul, Octavia Spencer and Nick Offerman—took place in September 2011. To prepare for her role, Winstead talked with Burke about her recovery and attended {{a variety of}} AA meetings, where she spoke with other young women <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> sober. To act drunk, she used Ivana Chubbuck's method as described in her book The Power of the Actor.

500|$|British troops {{began their}} march at 2am on April 19, and Smith sent troops ahead under Major John Pitcairn. When Pitcairn {{and his men}} found a company of armed colonials at Lexington, he ordered them to disperse. [...] In the confusion, a shot was fired from an unknown source, which brought several volleys from the British troops. [...] Eight of the local men were killed and one British soldier was wounded. [...] The British burned or {{otherwise}} destroyed what supplies they could find in Concord, and a second confrontation {{took place at the}} North Bridge. The bridge was held by the British, and by then about 400minutemen had assembled. Seeing the smoke from Concord, the colonials believed the town was being burned, and attempted to cross the bridge to succor it. The British fired on them but the colonials returned fire and defeated them. [...] The British, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> reinforcements once they realized the countryside was roused against them, began their march to Boston harassed by at least 2,000militiamen who inflicted a steady toll by gunfire until the British gained the protection of the cannon near Boston. The encounters at Lexington and Concord were the first battles of what became the Revolutionary War.|$|E
500|$|The next {{match was}} between John Cena and Bray Wyatt. The Wyatt Family's {{entrance}} was voodoo-themed and performed live by a costumed Mark Crozer and the Rels. Wyatt started the match by kneeling down and telling Cena {{to be the}} monster that he is and to finish him off; Cena refused. Wyatt continued taunts led to an enraged Cena's aggressive retaliation, but Wyatt just laughed while taking punishment. Cena managed to collect himself and reverted to his normal self, attempting his signature Five Knuckle Shuffle when suddenly Wyatt responded with a 'crab pose' that shocked Cena into retreating. Wyatt later hit a DDT on the apron, {{but it was not}} enough to beat Cena. Cena climbed to the top rope, but instead of attacking Wyatt, Cena dove onto Wyatt's henchmen Harper and Rowan at ringside. Cena teased becoming a 'monster' again by preparing to smash Wyatt with the steel ring steps, but he could not do it and threw them away. Wyatt took too much time when he held Cena while singing [...] "He's Got the Whole World in His Hands", so Cena hit his signature Attitude Adjustment maneuver but Wyatt kicked out. At ringside, Cena tackled Harper through the guardrail at the timekeeper's area. Back in the ring, Cena put Wyatt in his signature STF submission, but Wyatt reached the ropes. Wyatt followed with his signature Sister Abigail for a near fall. Wyatt introduced a steel folding chair into the ring by tossing it to Cena, again begging Cena to use it on him and thereby ruin his own legacy. Cena instead attacked Rowan (<b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> on the ring apron) with the chair, so Wyatt capitalized by rolling him up for another near fall. Cena countered another Sister Abigail attempt and hit another Attitude Adjustment for the win.|$|E
