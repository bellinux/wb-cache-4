5|$|Bromine has {{sometimes}} been considered to be possibly essential in humans, but this is supported by only limited circumstantial evidence, and no clear biological role. As a pharmaceutical, the simple bromide ion (Br−) has inhibitory effects on the central nervous system, and bromide salts <b>were</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> major medical sedative, before replacement by shorter-acting drugs. They retain niche uses as antiepileptics.|$|E
5|$|State Highway 74, usually {{abbreviated}} as SH-74 or OK-74 (or simply Highway 74) is the numbering of {{two different}} highways maintained by the U.S. state of Oklahoma. These highways <b>were</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> single major north–south route, connecting Oklahoma City to more rural parts of the state. The original road stretched from SH-7 near Tatums, Oklahoma to SH-11 west of Deer Creek.|$|E

5|$|Although these criticisms still {{form the}} {{prevailing}} {{view on the}} History's literary worth, modern scholars such as Rohrbacher have begun to argue that, while it is poorly written and not a stylistic or polished work, its use of allusion {{as a vehicle for}} parodying popular late 4th century biographical and historiographical works means that the very features which <b>were</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> cause for intense criticism (such as the inclusion of irrelevant or contradictory inventions alongside traditionally sourced material) are actually an intentional and integral part of the work, {{making it one of the}} most unique pieces of literature to emerge from the ancient world.|$|E
5|$|Burt was {{generous in}} life and honored after death. His {{charitable}} giving to Saginaw during his lifetime was extensive, including funding the City Auditorium, the Burt Manual Training School, a women’s hospital, a Salvation Army and a YWCA that later became Jacobson’s. The town of Burt, Michigan is named for him, as is Burt Street in Saginaw, which borders the same block as his former home. The Burt Opera House in Taymouth Township carries his name and is still in use today as a community center. Trips on the paddle steamer Wellington R. Burt <b>were</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> popular day excursion along the Saginaw River (1876–1891). Burt {{was inducted into the}} Saginaw Hall of Fame in 1967.|$|E
5|$|Once a vital ritual {{among the}} world's monarchies, coronations {{have changed over}} time {{for a variety of}} socio-political and {{religious}} factors; most modern monarchies have dispensed with them altogether, preferring simpler ceremonies to mark a monarch's accession to the throne. In the past, concepts of royalty, coronation and deity were often inexorably linked. In some ancient cultures, rulers were considered to be divine or partially divine: the Egyptian pharaoh was believed to be the son of Ra, the sun god, while in Japan, the emperor was believed to be a descendant of Amaterasu, the sun goddess. Rome promulgated the practice of emperor worship; in Medieval Europe, monarchs claimed to have a divine right to rule (analogous to the Mandate of Heaven in dynastic China). Coronations <b>were</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> direct visual expression of these alleged connections, but recent centuries have seen the lessening of such beliefs.|$|E

25|$|Mining {{other than}} {{construction}} materials is virtually limited to coal, {{which is located}} in the mountainous western part of the state. The brownstone quarries in the east, which gave Baltimore and Washington much of their characteristic architecture in the mid-19th century, <b>were</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> predominant natural resource. Historically, there used to be small gold-mining operations in Maryland, some near Washington, but these no longer exist.|$|E
25|$|Ashkenazi men show low Y-DNA {{diversity}} within each major haplogroup, meaning that {{compared to the}} size of the modern population, it seems there <b>were</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> relatively small number of men having children. This possibly results from a series of founder events and high rates of endogamy within Europe. Despite Ashkenazi Jews representing a recently founded population in Europe, founding effects suggest that they probably derived from a large and diverse ancestral source population in the Middle East, who may have been larger than the source population from which the indigenous Europeans derived.|$|E
25|$|Carrickkildavnet Castle is a 15th-century tower house {{associated}} with the O'Malley Clan, who <b>were</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> ruling family of Achill. Grace O' Malley, or Granuaile, {{the most famous of}} the O'Malleys, was born on Clare Island around 1530. Her father was the chieftain of the barony of Murrisk. The O'Malleys were a powerful seafaring family, who traded widely. Grace became a fearless leader and gained fame as a sea captain and pirate. She is reputed to have met with Queen Elizabeth I in 1593. She died around 1603 and is buried in the O'Malley family tomb on Clare Island.|$|E

25|$|After {{discovering}} that the de Lutrelle's <b>were</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> rich aristocratic family in France {{and they still}} have a few remnants of that wealth, Lily plots to travel through the mirror in order to steal their crown. Fergus goes through the mirror to try to help Constance but he gets sidetracked in the gold fields. He gets talking to one of the miners and trades his pocket knife for a land lease. After Daniel and Constance stop Lily from stealing the de Lutrelle's crown, she returns through the mirror and moves it so the others are trapped.|$|E
25|$|Glass bead {{sterilizers}} work by heating {{glass beads}} to 250°C. Instruments are then quickly doused in these glass beads, which heat the object while physically scraping contaminants off their surface. Glass bead sterilizers <b>were</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> common sterilization method employed in dental offices {{as well as}} biological laboratories, but are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) {{to be used as}} a sterilizers since 1997. They are still popular in European as well as Israeli dental practices although there are no current evidence-based guidelines for using this sterilizer.|$|E
25|$|Unlike promotional models {{which had}} sealed hoods, no engine detail and basic {{suspension}} detail molded into the chassis, kits usually had opening hoods, full engine detail, complete interiors and detailed multi-part suspensions. Earlier kits had less chassis detail and featured promo-like interiors, metal axles, whitewall tires and screws {{to attach the}} body to the chassis. Later kits often had more detail but metal parts such as axles, screws and hood clips were either deleted or made of plastic instead. Miniature whitewall tires, which <b>were</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> regular feature of kits, became outdated and modern blackwall tires took their place as they did on actual cars.|$|E

25|$|With a {{total area}} of , New Delhi forms {{a small part}} of the Delhi {{metropolitan}} area. Since the city is located on the Indo-Gangetic Plain, there is little difference in elevation across the city. New Delhi and surrounding areas <b>were</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> part of the Aravali Range; all that is left of those mountains is the Delhi Ridge, which is also called the Lungs of Delhi. While New Delhi lies on the floodplains of the Yamuna River, it is essentially a landlocked city. East of the river is the urban area of Shahdara. New Delhi falls under the seismic zone-IV, making it vulnerable to earthquakes.|$|E
25|$|The Rebels <b>were</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> {{powerhouse}} in Division II before {{jumping to}} Division I-A (now Division I FBS) and {{have seen some}} trouble since their promotion.

The Rebels have only won two conference championships in their history, both in the Big West Conference. They have had nine All-Americans, 13 times, nine Conference MVPs, one Conference Student Athlete of the Year, three Conference Coaches of the Year, four Conference Freshman of the Year and two Freshman All-Americans.|$|E
25|$|Saturn's rings {{may be very}} old, {{dating to}} the {{formation}} of Saturn itself. There are two main theories regarding the origin of Saturn's inner rings. One theory, originally proposed by Édouard Roche in the 19th century, is that the rings <b>were</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> moon of Saturn (named Veritas, after a Roman goddess who hid in a well) whose orbit decayed until it came close enough to be ripped apart by tidal forces (see Roche limit). A variation on this theory is that this moon disintegrated after being struck by a large comet or asteroid. The second theory is that the rings were never part of a moon, but are instead left over from the original nebular material from which Saturn formed.|$|E
