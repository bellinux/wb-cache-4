40|$|Abstract: We find {{differential}} {{rates of}} cohabitation <b>with</b> <b>adult</b> <b>relatives</b> {{as well as}} differential impacts of that cohabitation on the probability of employment for married female immigrants across regions of origin. This suggests that traditions and/or cultural determinants of family structure influence female labor force participation. Not surprisingly, we also find that the labor supply response is biggest for immigrants with young children. This further suggests that cohabitation allows married immigrant women to share childcare and other household responsibilities, which in turn increases the probability that they work outside of the home.

40|$|Regular {{contact between}} {{children}} and their adult relatives {{can be a problem}} if they live in different time zones. In this situation, finding an agreed time to contact each other can be both confusing and complicated. This paper presents a study of the effect of time zone differences on communication between grandparents and grandchildren living in different time zones. We deployed a system between time zone distributed families to study this effect and analysed its use based on four parameters of time and events based theory: rigid sequential structures (that some events cannot occur before others), fixed durations (that most events always last the same time), standard temporal locations (that events have a standard time when they occur during the day) and uniform rates of recurrence (that some events always reoccur at a uniform rate). Our findings highlight the importance of: the need to consider the parents ’ role in facilitating contact and making the technology easy to use by children independently; the advantage of concurrent synchronous and asynchronous interaction forms; and the need to respect people’s private time. These findings can inform the design of technology for supporting young children’s communications <b>with</b> <b>adult</b> <b>relatives</b> across time zones...|$|E

40|$|According to the genic capture hypothesis, the {{maintenance}} of additive genetic variation in fitness-related traits is due to both condition-dependence of these traits and high genetic variation for condition. Evidence supporting this latter assumption is scarce. In this study, we investigated, using hemiclonal analysis, standing genetic variation for condition and <b>relative</b> <b>adult</b> fitness in male Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen) (Diptera: Drosophilidae). The absolute fat and the relative fat content were used as indices of body condition and were measured along <b>with</b> <b>adult</b> <b>relative</b> fitness from males reared in high or low larval densities. The results did not demonstrate genetic variation for condition or <b>adult</b> <b>relative</b> fitness.

After MERS-CoV infections occurred in {{an extended family}} in Saudi Arabia in 2014, relatives were tested by using real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) and serologic methods. Among 79 relatives, 19 (24 %) were MERS-CoV positive; 11 were hospitalized, and 2 died. Eleven (58 %) tested positive by rRT-PCR; 8 (42 %) tested negative by rRT-PCR but positive by serology.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Recent {{studies have}} found an {{increased}} risk for both anxiety disorder and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the adult relatives of children with ADHD in comparison <b>with</b> <b>adult</b> <b>relatives</b> of normal controls. Such findings {{may account for the}} high rates of comorbid anxiety found in children with ADHD, and they suggest a relationship between the two disorders. However, additional studies are needed to address this relationship that include both anxiety disorder and normal control groups. METHOD: The first- (n = 239) and second-degree relatives (n = 1, 266) of clinically referred boys with ADHD (n = 49), clinically referred boys with anxiety disorder (n = 46), and controls who have never been psychiatrically ill (NPI controls) (n = 37) were assessed with structured interview and diagnosed according to DSM-III-R criteria. Lifetime rates of ADHD and anxiety disorder were then compared for relatives in the three proband groups. RESULTS: Female relatives of ADHD probands had significantly higher rates of anxiety disorder than female relatives of NPI controls. However, relatives of anxious probands and NPI controls did not differ for ADHD. Furthermore, no evidence of cosegregation of anxiety disorder with ADHD was found in the relatives of probands in the two patient groups. CONCLUSIONS: ADHD and anxiety may share common risk factors but appear to be independently transmitted in families. The high rate of anxiety in female relatives of ADHD probands was comparable with that found in relatives of anxious probands and warrants further investigation...|$|E

40|$|Acute {{respiratory}} infections cause considerable morbidity among Inuit children, {{but there}} is very little information on the risk factors for these infections in this population. To identify such factors, the authors performed a prospective community-based study of acute respiratory infections in an open cohort of 288 children aged 0 – 2 years in the town of Sisimiut, Greenland. Between July 1996 and August 1998, children were monitored weekly, and episodes of upper and lower respiratory tract infections were registered. Risk factor analyses were carried out using a multivariate Poisson regression model adjusted for age. Risk factors for upper respiratory tract infections included attending a child-care center (relative risk = 1. 7 compared with home care) and sharing a bedroom <b>with</b> <b>adults</b> (<b>relative</b> risk = 2. 5 for one adult and 3. 1 for two adults). Risk factors for lower respiratory tract infections included being a boy (relative risk = 1. 5), attending a child-care center (relative risk = 3. 3), exposure to passive smoking (relative risk = 2. 1), and sharing a bedroom with children aged 0 – 5 years (relative risk = 2. 0 for two other children). Breastfeeding tended to be protective for lower respiratory tract infections. The population-attributable risk of lower respiratory tract infections associated with passive smoking and child-care centers was 47 % and 48 %, respectively.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether providing early PN to critically ill <b>adults</b> <b>with</b> <b>relative</b> contraindications to early EN alters outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter, randomized, single-blind clinical trial conducted between October 2006 and June 2011 in ICUs of 31 community and tertiary hospitals in Australia and New Zealand. Participants were critically ill <b>adults</b> <b>with</b> <b>relative</b> contraindications to early EN who were expected {{to remain in the}} ICU longer than 2 days. INTERVENTIONS: Random allocation to pragmatic standard care or early PN. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Day- 60 mortality; quality of life, infections, and body composition. RESULTS: A total of 1372 patients were randomized (686 to standard care, 686 to early PN). Of 682 patients receiving standard care, 199 patients (29. 2 %) initially commenced EN, 186 patients (27. 3 %) initially commenced PN, and 278 patients (40. 8 %) remained unfed. Time to EN or PN in patients receiving standard care was 2. 8 days (95 % CI, 2. 3 to 3. 4). Patients receiving early PN commenced PN a mean of 44 minutes after enrollment (95 % CI, 36 to 55). Day- 60 mortality did not differ significantly (22. 8 % for standard care vs 21. 5 % for early PN; risk difference, − 1. 26 %; 95 % CI, − 6. 6 to 4. 1; P =. 60). Early PN patients rated day- 60 quality of life (RAND- 36 General Health Status) statistically, but not clinically meaningfully, higher (45. 5 for standard care vs 49. 8 for early PN; mean difference, 4. 3; 95 % CI, 0. 95 to 7. 58; P =. 01). Early PN patients required fewer days of invasive ventilation (7. 73 vs 7. 26 days per 10 patient × ICU days, risk difference, − 0. 47; 95 % CI, − 0. 82 to − 0. 11; P =. 01) and, based on Subjective Global Assessment, experienced less muscle wasting (0. 43 vs 0. 27 score increase per week; mean difference, − 0. 16; 95 % CI, − 0. 28 to − 0. 038; P =. 01) and fat loss (0. 44 vs 0. 31 score increase per week; mean difference, − 0. 13; 95 % CI, − 0. 25 to − 0. 01; P =. 04). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The provision of early PN to critically ill <b>adults</b> <b>with</b> <b>relative</b> contraindications to early EN, compared with standard care, did not result in a difference in day- 60 mortality. The early PN strategy resulted in significantly fewer days of invasive ventilation but not significantly shorter ICU or hospital stays.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: In {{this study}} we {{evaluated}} changes in serum Mullerian inhibiting substance (MIS) concentration in {{a large number of}} patients with granulosa cell tumors (GCT) to determine whether MIS is elevated at the time of presentation and whether MIS is an index of successful surgical resection and management of recurrences. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed MIS levels from 17 subjects prior to tumor resection and studied serial MIS samples from 56 subjects following initial tumor resection. Clinical follow-up information was available for 36 of those with postoperative MIS values. Serum MIS was measured by an ELISA. MIS values were compared to a combination of normative values previously established in our laboratory and from more recently obtained samples from older pre- and postmenopausal women, using this assay. RESULTS: Serum MIS was elevated pre-operatively in 6 of 8 (75 %) subjects with juvenile GCTs and in 7 of 9 (78 %) of those <b>with</b> <b>adult</b> GCTs <b>relative</b> to age-matched controls (76 % for both types combined). Post-operative clinical correlation was available for 36 patients. There was no clinical recurrence in 21 subjects with normal or undetectable postoperative values, and incompletely resectable tumor or recurrence was identified in 6 of 15 patients with elevated postoperative values. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate that postoperative serum MIS concentrations may be used to evaluate the completeness of tumor removal following initial surgery and that serial MIS determinations may allow the detection of recurrences...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{describe}} {{trends in}} single parenthood in Russia, examining {{factors that affect}} living arrangements in single-mother families. Before economic reform, single mothers and their children were somewhat protected form poverty by government assistance (income support, subsidized child care, and full employment guarantees). Economic reform in Russia has reduced government transfers, eliminated publicly subsidized pre-school care programs, and worsened women's opportunities in the labor market. The loss of government support has eroded family stability, and left single mothers at increased risk of poverty. Over the last decade, the proportion of households headed by women has increased rapidly, raising the risk of poverty. Single-parent families now represent {{nearly a quarter of}} all Russian households. Using seven rounds of data from the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey, the authors investigate how household living arrangements, and other factors, affect income in single-mother families. They find that a single parent with more earning power, and child benefits is more likely not to live with relatives. But single mothers are increasingly choosing to live <b>with</b> other <b>adults,</b> or <b>relatives,</b> to survive, and to raise their children in times of economic stress, and uncertainty. Half of all single mothers in Russia live with their parents, their adult siblings, or other <b>adult</b> <b>relatives.</b> Help from relatives is important to single-mother families, and that help - including the sharing of domestic and childcare duties - is more efficient, and productive when the single parent lives with the family. The other half live in independent residences, and face increased risk of poverty.

40|$|Background: Response {{inhibition}} is {{an executive}} function that requires voluntary control over responses {{when there is}} a change of context. The right inferior frontal cortex is necessary for response inhibition, and a deficit in right frontostriatal circuitry might underlie attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Many studies of child-hood ADHD have demonstrated impaired response inhi-bition and its amelioration by methylphenidate (MPH). The current study tested response inhibition and the effect of MPH in adult ADHD. Methods: Response inhibition was assessed with the “tracking ” stop-signal test in 13 <b>adults</b> <b>with</b> a diagnosis of ADHD, both while taking and while not taking medication, and 13 healthy, unmedicated, age- and intelligence quo-tient–matched control subjects. Results: Stop-signal reaction time was significantly slower in unmedicated <b>adults</b> <b>with</b> ADHD <b>relative</b> to healthy control subjects, and this deficit was significantly ameliorated by medication. Conclusions: Adult ADHD patients had a response inhibition profile similar to that produced by lesions to the right inferior frontal cortex, which was remedied by stimulant medication.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to examine {{well-being}} among family carers and <b>adults</b> <b>with</b> an intellectual disability (ID). In a series of four studies, I examined 1) parents’ experiences and feelings {{during the process of}} seeking out-of-home accommodation for their <b>adult</b> child <b>with</b> ID, 2) how <b>adults</b> <b>with</b> an ID who live at home report on their own well-being, 3) the physical and psychological health of family carers and 4) factors related to the process of moving out of the family home in adulthood. Chapter 1 provides a background picture of adulthood with an ID, examining health and support issues and what has been achieved in terms of policy and strategies in the UK. Estimations of future need for <b>adults</b> <b>with</b> ID have also been explored. Adopting a qualitative design, Chapter 2 examines the experiences of families seeking out-of-home accommodation for their relative with ID. Little attention has been given to the first-hand experiences of families as they undertake this process. Thematic analysis identified implicit themes in the data, which included families’ reasons for seeking housing and experiences within a process which families reported as stressful and frustrating. In Chapter 3, secondary data analysis was undertaken on a large national survey of <b>adults</b> <b>with</b> an ID in England (Emerson, Malam, Davies, & Spencer, 2005). An examination of adults’ self-reported health and well-being was undertaken exploring associations with living circumstances. Results of multivariate modelling showed those who lived at home {{were more likely to report}} better well-being and health. The latter, however, only when their support needs were lower. Results highlight the important role of families to the emotional development of a relative with ID, whilst also highlighting potential disparities in access to health care for these individuals. Chapter 4, a large scale quantitative project was undertaken to examine both positive and negative aspects of the caregiving experience and explore the self-reported health and well-being of family carers co-residing <b>with</b> an <b>adult</b> <b>relative</b> <b>with</b> ID. Families in the UK report experiencing poorer health outcomes than non-caregivers. Psychological resources (coping and support received) were associated with better psychological adjustment and more positive gains from the caregiving role. Overall factors associated with physical health appear to differ from those associated with psychological health. Further research with more representative non-caregiving peers is needed. Chapter 5 adopted a prospective design to examine the dynamics of placement tendencies of families of <b>adults</b> <b>with</b> ID and factors associated change in placement decisions and behaviours. The majority of families who had placed their relative out-of-home had initially recorded higher scores on the Placement Tendency Index (PTI, Blacher, 1990). The rate of placement of adults appeared to occur more rapidly than previously demonstrated with children. This may result from the more normative context of seeking a placement for an <b>adult</b> <b>relative.</b> Unadjusted ORs indicated only families’ coping strategies were significantly associated with continued home care. Other factors were not significantly related to changes in PTI scores. Changes in placement decision of families of <b>adults</b> <b>with</b> ID may be more affected by factors external to the family, such as availability of appropriate accommodation. Findings from these empirical studies were discussed in relation to their implications to policy and practice and recommendations for future research were made...|$|R

40|$|Aim:The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to explore young adults’ {{transitions}} within psychiatric care {{from the perspective of}} young <b>adults,</b> <b>relatives,</b> and professionals. Method: The thesis includes four studies (I–IV) with a qualitative approach. Data for study I were collected through focus group discussionswith professionals of child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP) and general psychiatry (GenP), and analyzed using deductive content analysisbased on Meleis’s theory of transition. Data for studies II–IVwere collected from individualinterviews <b>with</b> young <b>adults</b> and <b>relatives</b> withexpectations and experiences of transfer from CAP to GenP (II), from young <b>adults</b> <b>with</b> experiences of care in both CAP and GenP (III), andfrom relatives with experiences of parenting young <b>adults</b> <b>with</b> mental illness (IV). The data from studies II–IV were analyzed using grounded theory(GT) as described by Corbin and Strauss. Results:The synthesis of the four studies (I–IV) resulted in a grounded theory, “Support and intrinsic motivation as prerequisites for transition and recovery,” describing young adults’ transitions within psychiatric care. The result shows that young <b>adults</b> <b>with</b> mental illness undergo multiple simultaneous transitions during transfer from CAP to GenP, and that theseinclude developmental, situational/organizational, and health/illness transitions. It was important for the young adult to achieve intrinsic motivation in order to take responsibility for healthcare matters, to continue care, and to strive for recovery. Intrinsic motivation to continue care was created by trustful, caring relationships with professionals who encountered the young adults as a person, with respect to maturity. Furthermore, the result shows the importance of inclusive attitudes towards relatives, with possibilities for them to participate in young adults’ care as well as opportunities to receive professional support for themselves, which facilitated relatives’ abilities to manage their own lives and, moreover, to continue to providesupport to young <b>adults</b> <b>with</b> mental illness. Conclusions:This thesis highlights knowledge about the multiple simultaneous transitions that young adults experience when they reach the age of 18 and have closure of their care at CAP and continue care at GenP. To facilitate these transitions and empower young adults to continue care when it is needed and to strive for recovery, professionals need {{to take into account the}} factorsthat facilitate or inhibit healthy outcomes. Transition planning in cooperation with CAP, GenP, the young adult, and his or her relatives is recommended in order to reduce uncertainty about the new situation. It is also important to take into account that young adults need continuity andsupport in order to create trustful relationships. To reduce the risk of “falling into the caring gap,” individual assessments about young adults’ needs,intrinsic motivation to receive care, and access to support from relatives should be implemented in the transition planning. If the young adultsand their relatives fail to receive the support they need, the risk for their dropping out of care is increased.

40|$|Objective: Memory deficits {{have been}} shown in {{patients}} affected by schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar (BP) /mood disorder. We recently reported that young high-risk offspring of an affected parent were impaired in both verbal episodic memory (VEM) and visual episodic memory (VisEM). Understanding better the trajectory of memory impairments from childhood to adult clinical status in risk populations is crucial for early detection and prevention. In multigenerational families densely affected by SZ or BP, {{our aim was to}} compare the memory impairments observed in young nonaffected offspring with memory functioning in nonaffected <b>adult</b> <b>relatives</b> and patients. Methods: For 20 years, we followed up numerous kindreds in the Eastern Québec population. After having characterized the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders phenotypes, we assessed cognition (N = 381) in 3 subsamples in these kindreds and in controls: 60 young offspring of a parent affected by SZ or BP, and in the adult generations, 92 nonaffected <b>adult</b> <b>relatives</b> and 40 patients affected by SZ or BP. VEM was assessed with the California Verbal Learning Test and VisEM with the Rey figures. Results: The VEM deficits observed in the offspring were also found in <b>adult</b> <b>relatives</b> and patients. In contrast, the VisEM impairments observed in the young offspring were present only in patients, not in the <b>adult</b> <b>relatives.</b> Conclusion: Implications for prevention and genetic mechanisms can be drawn from the observation that VEM and VisEM would show distinct generational trajectories and that the trajectory associated with VisEM may offer a better potential than VEM to predict future risk of developing the disease...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Neonatal monocytes display {{immaturity}} {{of numerous}} functions compared <b>with</b> <b>adult</b> cells. Gene expression arrays provide a promising tool for elucidating mechanisms underlying neonatal immune function. We used a well-established microarray to analyze differences between LPS-stimulated human cord blood and adult monocytes to create dynamic models for interactions to elucidate observed deficiencies in neonatal immune responses. We identified 168 genes that were differentially expressed between adult and cord monocytes after 45 min incubation with LPS. Of these genes, 95 % (159 of 167) were over-expressed in <b>adult</b> <b>relative</b> to cord monocytes. Differentially expressed genes could be sorted into nine groups {{according to their}} kinetics of activation. Functional modelling suggested differences between adult and cord blood in the regulation of apoptosis, a finding confirmed using annexin binding assays. We conclude that kinetic studies of gene expression reveal potentially important differences in gene expression dynamics that may provide insight into neonatal innate immunity. </p...|$|R

The loss of a close <b>adult</b> <b>relative</b> is a significant life transition that almost everyone experiences {{at some point in}} the lifecourse and which may have a range of material, social and emotional consequences for children and families. The research aimed to investigate the material and emotional significance of a death of a close <b>adult</b> <b>relative</b> for family members of different genders and generations in urban Senegal. It aimed to explore how the death of a close relative impacts on identities, caring relations and responsibilities among families of varying socio-economic status and diverse ethnicities (focusing on the three largest ethnic groups, Wolof, Hal Pulaaren and Serer) in two cities...|$|R
