40|$|The {{research}} {{was done with}} the aim of evaluating the effect of the basin tillage system as a method of conservation agriculture, on improving smallholder farmers’ food security in Mutasa, Manicaland Province in Zimbabwe. This research focussed on the 2010 / 2011 agricultural season. The main objectives of this study were to determine the contribution of CA basin tillage system on increasing yields per hectare, to evaluate which CA principles are being practiced by smallholder farmers, and to determine how many months the harvested maize will last. The study compares smallholder farmers <b>who</b> <b>practiced</b> CA with farmers <b>who</b> <b>practiced</b> other tillage methods. The other tillage methods are ploughing and conventional hand hoe tillage systems. On average the farmers <b>who</b> <b>practiced</b> CA used 0. 47 hectares of land whilst farmers <b>who</b> <b>practiced</b> other tillage methods used an average of 0. 43 hectares of land. The average amount of maize produced by smallholder farmers <b>who</b> <b>practiced</b> CA was 824 kg while <b>who</b> <b>practiced</b> other tillage methods produced an average of 498 kg. Farmers practicing CA produced yield with an average of 1175 kg/ha of maize grain while farmers <b>who</b> <b>practiced</b> other tillage methods produced an average of 946 kg/ha. Food security in this reaseach was measured by the amount of months the maize grain produced was lasting in relation with the household size. 57 percent of the farmers <b>who</b> <b>practiced</b> CA are food secure because they have maize grain to last them a full consumption year and moreover surplus. Only 27 percent of the farmers <b>who</b> <b>practiced</b> other tillage methods produced enough to last a full consumption yea...|$|R

Riad décor is widely used in carpets and textiles, ceramics, woodwork, metal work and zelij. Carpets and textiles are weaved, sewn or embroidered, sometimes used for upholstering. Moroccan women <b>who</b> <b>practice</b> craftsmanship are known as Maalems (expert craftspeople) and make such fine products as Berber carpets and shawls made of sabra (cactus silk). Ceramics are in monochrome Berber-style only, a limited tradition depicting bold forms and decorations.|$|E
5|$|The {{classical}} {{texts of}} Hinduism devote numerous chapters discussing what people <b>who</b> <b>practice</b> {{the virtue of}} Ahimsa, can and must do when they are faced with war, violent threat or need to sentence someone convicted of a crime. These discussions have led to theories of just war, theories of reasonable self-defence and theories of proportionate punishment. Arthashastra discusses, among other things, why and what constitutes proportionate response and punishment.|$|E

The number of Antankarana <b>who</b> <b>practice</b> a standard, orthodox form of Islam is negligible.|$|E

5|$|The fifth book {{returns to}} the subject of faith. Clement argues that truth, justice and {{goodness}} can be seen only by the mind, not the eye; faith is a way of accessing the unseeable. He stresses that knowledge of God can only be achieved through faith once one's moral faults have been corrected. This parallels Clement's earlier insistence that martyrdom can only be achieved by those <b>who</b> <b>practice</b> their faith in Christ through good deeds, not those who simply profess their faith. God transcends matter entirely, and thus the materialist cannot truly come to know God. Although Christ was God incarnate, it is our spiritual, not physical comprehension of him which is important.|$|E
5|$|According to the Malaysian Department of Statistics, the country's {{population}} was 28,334,135 in 2010, {{making it the}} 42nd most populated country. According to a 2012 estimate, the population is increasing by 1.54 percent per year. Malaysia has an average population density of 96 people per km², ranking it 116th {{in the world for}} population density. People within the 15–64 age group constitute 69.5 percent of the total population; the 0–14 age group corresponds to 24.5 percent; while senior citizens aged 65 years or older make up 6.0 percent. In 1960, when the first official census was recorded in Malaysia, the {{population was}} 8.11 million. 91.8 per cent of the population are Malaysian citizens. Malaysian citizens are divided along ethnic lines, with 67.4 per cent considered bumiputera The largest group of bumiputera are Malays, who are defined in the constitution as Muslims <b>who</b> <b>practice</b> Malay customs and culture. They play a dominant role politically. Bumiputera status is also accorded to certain non-Malay indigenous peoples, including ethnic Thais, Khmers, Chams and the natives of Sabah and Sarawak. Non-Malay bumiputera make up more than half of Sarawak's population and over two thirds of Sabah's population. There also exist aboriginal groups in much smaller numbers on the peninsula, where they are collectively known as the Orang Asli. Laws over who gets bumiputera status vary between states.|$|E
5|$|The Mikea are hunter-gatherers (also called foragers) <b>who</b> <b>practice</b> limited farming. The Mikea {{label is}} applied to those who live this {{subsistence}} lifestyle rather than being tied to a specific ethnicity. There are numerous groups termed Mikea along the west and southwest coast of Madagascar, with the majority living {{in and around the}} spiny Mikea Forest on the southwestern coast between Morombe and Toliara, an area extending 2500 square kilometers. Historically this main concentration of Mikea may have extended as far south as the Fiherenana River and as far north as the Mangoky River; another main cluster of Mikea live to the west and southwest of Lake Ihotry. They are typically considered a subset of the Sakalava ethnic group, although there are Mikea individuals who trace their origins to other ethnic groups. Their adherence to a way of life perceived by villagers and city dwellers as ancestral has contributed to a mystique and various myths and legends about them, and many Malagasy believe they are the descendents of Vazimba, the original inhabitants of the island, although {{there is no evidence to}} support this view. The majority of Malagasy believe the existence of the Mikea to be a myth and are unaware that any Malagasy continue to live the Mikea lifestyle to the present day. The term Mikea is principally used by outsiders to label this group and is not often used by members of this community themselves. Most Mikea prefer to call themselves either Vezo-Mikea or Masikoro-Mikea, depending on their specific family lineages.|$|E
