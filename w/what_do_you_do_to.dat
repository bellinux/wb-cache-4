40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the behaviors that caregivers report carrying out to maintain their own health, and to compare the health-promoting behaviors of Black and White caregivers. Although many studies have examined health-promoting behaviors, few have examined health promotion among caregivers. Reported studies of caregivers’ health-promoting behaviors have not compared cultural groups. The sample for this study was selected by random digit dialing, and included 136 Black and 257 White caregivers of frail elders. Content analysis of respondents’ answers to the open-ended question, “In general, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> stay healthy?” was used to address the research questions. Most caregivers reported specific behaviors they engaged in for the purpose of staying healthy. Although most of their behaviors addressed physical health, caregivers also mentioned behaviors that contribute to mental and spiritual health. Both differences and similarities were found in Black and White caregivers’ self-reported health behaviors, which have important implications for nursing practice and research in the future...|$|E
40|$|<b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> reduce student {{attrition}} {{when there}} is negligible funding and your faculty will not permit remedial or developmental coursework? This was the question asked by the UMKC university-wide retention committee in 1972. The response to that question initiated the program known as Supplemental Instruction © (SI) and the more recent Video-based Supplemental Instruction © (VSI). The context of this question sets an important framework for our paper. A decade earlier, the University of Missouri had reached out to a small, private university in Kansas City along with several private professional schools and a private conservatory of music. The resultant amalgamation and reorganization produced the University of Missouri- Kansas City. As a public institution, UMKC faced some difficult adjustments, {{the first of which}} was a change in patterns of student access. Instead of limiting the student clientele to the affluent top 20 percent of high school graduates, the university now offered admission to a much more culturally and academically diverse population. This change was particularly difficult for many of the faculty who had come to the university precisely because the students wer...|$|E

40|$|Drawing on {{the classic}} model of {{balanced}} affect proposed by Bradburn (The structure of psychological well-being, Aldine, Chicago, IL, 1969), this study conceptualised poor work-related psychological health in terms of high levels of negative affect {{in the absence of}} acceptable levels of positive affect. In order to illuminate self-perceptions of work-related psychological health among a well-defined group of clergy, a random sample of 58 ministers of word and sacrament serving within the west midlands synod of the United Reformed Church in England completed an open-ended questionnaire concerned with the following six guiding questions. Do you enjoy your work? How would you define stress? How would you define burnout? What stresses are there in your ministry? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> keep healthy? What can the church do to enhance the work-related psychological health of ministers? Content analysis highlighted the main themes recurring through these open-ended responses. The conclusion is drawn that ministers of word and sacrament within the United Reformed Church in England are exposed to a number of recurrent recognisable sources of stress. Suggestions are advanced regarding the need for future more detailed research and for the development of more effective pastoral strategies...|$|E

In fact, we didn't always recognize that the industries that we build {{and the ways in which}} we use our resources can be damaging to the environment, or, subsequently, that damaging the environment can directly affect our health and our well being. Scientific and public awareness of the important balance between humans and nature has increased slowly since the beginning of the industrial age, but it wasn't until the last two decades that laws have been passed in this country to protect our waterways, our air, our groundwater and the diversity of species that find their homes in the wide array of habitats existing in these 50 states...|$|E

40|$|When we {{consider}} pain treatments, we think aboutall {{of the years}} of X-rays, CT scans, surgeries, physical therapy, counseling, and tests. These are the “normal ” approaches to pain manage-ment, but our personal, day-to-day therapies are different. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> help yourself cope? We each find therapies that apply to daily life and stick with what works. The techniques that the American Chronic Pain Association teaches help to reduce our sense of suffering while improving {{quality of life and}} increas-ing function. Throughout the ACPA’s 33 years of helping people manage their pain, we have continued to be open to learning new coping strategies and passing them along to you. For instance, many people use art or music to cope with pain. I don’t think I would have ever considered it a coping strategy before I went to a pain management program 34 years ago. As part of our regular daily activities, we went to creative therapy and experi-mented with a variety of art forms, such as leather work, copper enameling, or other crafts. I didn’t realize it at the time, but I often got lost in the process of creating. It gave my mind, and in some sense, my body, a rest. It didn’t matter what I created; it was the process that mattered. Later, I found that having ACPA sup-port group members create their own art during a meeting was somehow very calming and satisfying to everyone. I was amazed at the creativity of the members. They seem to lose themselves, just as I had at the pain management program. When we added music, it turned into an even better meeting...|$|E
40|$|These {{nursing homes}} were {{designed}} and built in the 80 's and 90 's. They experienced similar design and construction deficiencies and expensive repairs. Some of the issues to be discussed in this paper are the interactions of architectural and HVAC shortcomings that result in a synergistic increase in mold, mildew, corrosion and rot. ASHRAE 62 requires 24 hour per day toilet exhaust and fresh air. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> control humidity when the A/C duty cycles when the thermostat is satisfied? There needs to be humidity control designed into the HVAC system. Architects and contractors frequently take a "head in the sand" approach to wall and attic vapor barriers. This needs {{to be looked at}} realistically. We have seen several nursing homes whose moisture/sheet rock damage was severe due to design defects that allowed free interchange of hot humid air between the attic and the space inside interior partitions. Allowing air interchange between the attic and outdoors: can cause overheating of water in pipes in attics where temperaturs reach 150 ? F. increases condensation due to inadequate details in mechanical insulation on ducts and pipes Vinyl wall covering is well known to be a disaster in this climate but interior decorators continue to specify it on various walls. HVAC balance needs to be considered. Frequently the kitchen exhaust design is not coordinated with the HVAC engineer. There needs to be a reasonable balance between air in and air out of the building. When air is allowed to flow through the insulation system R value is reduced to near 0. In order to prevent mold and mildew and expensive failures, along with even more expensive lawsuits, the HVAC system design and the insulation system design must be integrated...|$|E
40|$|A {{request from}} the Essex health and social care mental health commissioners {{for a series of}} broad {{consultations}} to seek the views of service users and carers emerged {{as a response to the}} potential need for service redesign engendered by a new mental health policy framework (New Horizons 2009) for mental health and the continuing development of the personalisation agenda in a challenging economic climate. The ‘Big Conversation’ consultation was carried out by the MIME (Making Involvement Matter in Essex) during 2010. A total of seven events were held, attended by 122 mental health service users and cares and interested members of the general public. Participants were asked to address the following questions in small groups: 1) <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> keep yourself well? 2) We want you to dream – if you were designing a mental health service, what would it look like, what staff would work in it, what skills/knowledge would they have, what services would be provided? With the exception of one group, all the groups were facilitated by service user members of MIME. The main themes of the discussions revolved around 12 issues: 1) The importance of peer support; 2) The need for all service staff to have good listening skills; 3) A preference for services delivered in local generic centres close to home; 4) Improved provision of information conditions, treatment options and services; 5) Better inter-agency communication; 6) Increased employment of an increased number of people with personal experience of mental ill health in provider organisations; 7) Increased access to talking therapies including for people with complex needs who may need longer-term therapy; 8) The further development of service user and carer involvement in commissioning; 9) Greater prominence for social models of service delivery; 10) Service user involvement in risk management; 11) Development of cultural awareness in provider organisations; 12) Problems experienced by service users and carers when services are re-tendered and the provider changes...|$|E
