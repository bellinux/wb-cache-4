40|$|Cluster {{tools are}} highly {{integrated}} machines that can perform {{a sequence of}} semiconductor manufacturing processes. The sequence of <b>wafer</b> <b>handler</b> moves affects the total time needed to process a set of wafers. Reducing this time can reduce cycle time, reduce tool utilization, and increase tool capacity. This paper introduces the cluster tool scheduling problem for hybrid cluster tools, which are multiple-stage tools that {{have at least one}} stage with two or more parallel chambers. This paper presents algorithms that can find superior sequences of <b>wafer</b> <b>handler</b> moves. Experimental results show that the tool performance can be improved significantly if the <b>wafer</b> <b>handler</b> follows a cyclic sequence instead of using a dispatching rule...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} aims {{to develop}} algorithms that can minimize the total lot processing time (makespan) of cluster tools used for semiconductor manufacturing. Previous {{research focuses on}} finding an optimal sequence of <b>wafer</b> <b>handler</b> moves in a cluster tool that has one process chamber in each stage. In practice, {{if the number of}} chambers in a stage is more than one, either a pre-specified sequence of moves is given in advance or a dispatching rule is applied. No previous work has addressed the problem of finding an optimal sequence of <b>wafer</b> <b>handler</b> moves to improve performance of cluster tools with more than one chamber in a stage. Cluster tools are highly integrated machines that can perform a sequence of semiconductor manufacturing processes. The performance of cluster tools becomes increasingly important as the semiconductor industry produces larger wafers with smaller device geometry. Some factors that motivate the use of cluster tools, instead of stand-alone tools, include increased yield and throughput, less contamination, and less human intervention. In this research, the cluster tool is modeled as a manufacturing system with a material handling system (<b>wafer</b> <b>handler).</b> The model specifies all constraints that a feasible sequence of <b>wafer</b> <b>handler</b> moves must satisfy. The thesis develops two cluster tool scheduling algorithms. Given the lot size, the <b>wafer</b> <b>handler</b> move time, the in-chamber processing times, and the tool configuration the first algorithm, based on a complete forward branch-and-bound algorithm, searches for an optimal solution from the set of all feasible sequences of <b>wafer</b> <b>handler</b> moves. The second algorithm, a truncated branch-and-bound algorithm, quickly searches for the best solution from the set of feasible cyclic sequences of <b>wafer</b> <b>handler</b> moves. For simple tool configurations, analytical makespan models are also derived. The results show that, in many cases, the search algorithms can significantly reduce the total lot processing time. This reduces tool utilization, reduces manufacturing cycle times, and increases tool capacity...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} a new system for {{submicron}} lithography by fast laser direct writing, where a programmable phase modulating spatial light modulator (SLM) is imaged onto the wafer using flash on the fly exposure with an excimer laser light source. A SLM with 512 x 464 pixels has been developed and fabricated using a CMOS active matrix and a reflective, deformable viscoelastic layer on top. Using this light modulator for image generation a demonstrator exposure tool for 0. 6 mu m minimum feature size {{has been set up}} and tested including all the components necessary for the exposure of a complete lithographic layer from CAD layout data. the demonstrator is shown to give good quality 0. 6 mu m photoresist pattern at a throughput of roughly one 4 -inch-wafer per hour. Based on the demonstrator results we are designing and setting up a prototype of a production tool with an increased throughput of up to nine 6 -inch-wafer per hour including an automatic alignment system and an automatic <b>wafer</b> <b>handler...</b>|$|E
40|$|In the {{high-tech}} industry {{the call for}} higher precision and higher accuracy will never vanish. One of the aspects that influences precision and accuracy is transportation. To transport an object contact is needed. Stigmatically thinking, contact means having a mechanical connection between the transporter and the object to transport. However, if mechanical contact with {{the object is to}} be avoided, other means of transportation can be used. By avoiding mechanical contact certain benefits arise. For example contamination or surface damage (due to friction at the contact points) can be reduced by avoiding mechanical contact. The use of a device that can transport objects without contact is the basis for the thesis. The considered device uses an air bearing to carry and to position the object. This device is called the Contactless <b>Wafer</b> <b>Handler</b> (CWH). This contactless <b>wafer</b> <b>handler</b> is connected to an air supply system that generates the forces needed for carrying and actuation. To be able to support the object the air should be spread evenly across the object's surface. Also, the actuation function of the bearing requires the air flow to be controllable. This distribution of air is done by the supply manifold. A part of the CWH that consists of a labyrinth of channels, with inlets at the perimeter of the manifold and multiple outlets {{across the surface of the}} manifold. In this thesis the influence of the geometry of this supply manifold on the performance of the CWH is examined. The term performance is defined as the CWH's ability to accurately position the carried object. This performance is limited by numerous factors, one of which is the dynamics of the air in the manifold. The dynamic behavior is investigated in order to design manifolds that show optimal dynamic properties. The term optimal will be defined in this thesis. In order to obtain the optimal supply manifold the air dynamics are investigated. Using a setup consisting of a pneumatic valve and multiple air pressure sensors, models that can predict air dynamics are verified. Furthermore potentially interesting pseudo manifold geometries are analyzed. The pneumatic valve's actuation principle is piezo-electric and the valve is of the nozzle-flapper type. The pressure sensors measure strain in a membrane that deflects due to a pressure difference. The pneumatic valve and the pressure sensors used are of the same make as the ones used in the CWH. In this thesis it is shown that interesting geometries do exist and that their dynamics can be predicted with modeling. It is found that certain geometries can influence dynamics and that these influenced dynamics can benefit the performance of the CWH. MSDPMEMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|A {{functional}} {{model of}} an interface unit for 300 mm wafers {{was developed and}} tested. The interface unit {{is based on the}} technology whose concept was drafted in the project AUTOWEC 2 (project ID: 01 M 2910 P) and is based on a transport container with side opening door and a cassette which can not be removed from the transport container. The interface unit will {{become an integral part of}} the process equipment and will cover the functions of docking/undocking the container, opening/closing the door and alignment of wafers to the <b>wafer</b> <b>handler.</b> The functional model was tested with respect to its functions, reliability and particulate contamination. The results will become the basis for future development of interface products. The standardisation of the basic technology of these interface units as well as the transport containers was continued after the project AUTOWEC 2. A set of standards was prepared within the framework of SEMI and internationally discussed which resulted in a consensus of the industry and covers the technology of the functional model. In parallel, the majority of large IC manufacturers world wide decided to use this technology in their future fabs. This important decision of IC manufacturers was based on the technical project results as well as the successful international standardisation. (orig.)

40|$|ASML {{is a world}} leading {{supplier}} of complex lithography machines for the semiconductor industry. A lithography machine consists of many subsystems, e. g., Light Source, Lens, Reticle handler, Reticle stage, <b>Wafer</b> <b>handler</b> and Wafer stage, which synchronize together to make the machine work. The Reticle stage holds the circuit pattern, also known as reticle and the Wafer stage module holds the wafer. The UV light from the light source is projected on the circuit pattern, which is then passed through the lens to imprint the pattern on the wafer. Since the circuit pattern has to be imprinted on the wafer, {{the movement of the}} modules; Reticle stage and Wafer stage should be synchronized in six degrees of freedom (DoF) with nanometer accuracy. To employ the movement of the subsystems, motion controllers are used in ASML, and Long Stroke and Short Stroke controllers are responsible for the movement of a part of the Wafer stage subsystem. It has been envisioned that future lithography machines, because of its high precision mechatronic requirements, will need motion control algorithms, that run at higher sampling frequencies with a severely reduced IO latency budget. Current hardware architectures {{will not be able to}} meet the demands of these future motion control algorithms. In this thesis, we propose an architecture, that uses a multi-ASIP in FPGA as an accelerator in conjunction with a CPU, which acts as a master to run the motion control applications. The proposal of using multi-ASIP FPGA in conjunction with CPU is based on the analysis carried out previously in ASML. It was observed that a sampling frequency exceeding 100 KHz can be obtained after deploying the Long Stroke controller and Short Stroke controller on a multi-ASIP platform in FPGA. However, this work considered only the data flow and not the supervisory control. After carrying out detailed analysis, we could predict that a sampling frequency of 40 KHz could be achieved by offloading the compute intensive blocks present in the Long Stroke and Short Stroke controller from the CPU to FPGA. The sampling frequency of 40 KHz can be achieved by considering, both the data flow and supervisory control, and the communication between the CPU and FPGA. Finally, after offloading the compute intensive blocks from the CPU on the multi-ASIP FPGA, and after implementing the data flow and supervisory control and communication mechanism between the CPU and FPGA, we can justify that the sampling frequency of 40 KHz can be achieved.
