5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the race, Schumacher reduced Häkkinen's lead in the Drivers' Championship to two points, with David Coulthard a further 17 points back. Rubens Barrichello who <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the first lap accident was mathematically ruled out of clinching the title. In the Constructors' Championship, McLaren's eight-point advantage going into the race was reduced to four, with three races of the season remaining. Gislimberti later died in hospital and his death caused safety measures in Formula One to be reviewed.|$|E

Although Gobrecht's model is not known with certainty, some sources state that the bird in flight was based on Peter the eagle, a tame bird fed by Mint workers in the early 1830s until it <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> machinery and killed. The bird was stuffed, and is still displayed at the Philadelphia Mint.|$|E

5|$|After Aubers Ridge, {{the corps}} was then rested {{in a quiet}} sector until September, when it {{deployed}} for the Battle of Loos. The initial attack was {{to be made by}} three divisions, with the Meerut Division leading the attack on the Indian front; Blackader's brigade, with two Gurkha battalions and the 2nd Leicesters, was on its right flank. Whilst the attack successfully crossed no-man's land under cover of the barrage, the right flank of the brigade <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> defensive wire, and only one battalion successfully made their way into the German trenches; the brigade lost momentum and dug in.|$|E
5|$|In 1973 the LPO <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a {{recurring}} phenomenon of London orchestral life: the conviction in official circles that having four independent orchestras {{is too much}} for one city, and that two or more of the existing ensembles should merge. On this occasion the targets were the LPO and the New Philharmonia; the latter, a self-governing body formed under its new name when the Philharmonia was disbanded in 1964, was going through a bad patch, professionally and financially. The proposed merger would inevitably have led to redundancies, and the player-owners of both orchestras rejected the plan.|$|E

5|$|Although Alexander {{was known}} for his ostentatious and luxurious lifestyle, he founded a number of {{religious}} houses in his diocese and was an active builder and literary patron. He also attended church councils and reorganised his diocese by increasing the number of archdeaconries and setting up prebends to support his cathedral clergy. Under Henry's successor, King Stephen, Alexander <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the fall from favour of his family, and was imprisoned together with his uncle Roger in 1139. He subsequently briefly supported Stephen's rival, Matilda, but by the late 1140s Alexander was once again working with Stephen. He spent much of the late 1140s at the papal court in Rome, but died in England in early 1148. During his episcopate he began the rebuilding of his cathedral, which had been destroyed by fire. Alexander was the patron of medieval chroniclers Henry of Huntingdon and Geoffrey of Monmouth, and also served as an ecclesiastical patron of the medieval hermit Christina of Markyate and Gilbert of Sempringham, founder of the Gilbertines.|$|E
5|$|During the Second Great Awakening, {{the region}} was a hotbed of {{religious}} enthusiasm. Between 1817 and 1825, there were several camp meetings and revivals in the Palmyra area. Although Smith's parents disagreed about religion, the family <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> this excitement. Smith later said he became interested in religion by {{about the age of}} twelve. As a teenager, he may have been sympathetic to Methodism. With other family members, Smith also engaged in religious folk magic, which was a relatively common practice in that time and place. Both his parents and his maternal grandfather reportedly had visions or dreams that they believed communicated messages from God. Smith said that, although he had become concerned about the welfare of his soul, he was confused by the claims of competing religious denominations.|$|E

Holding Penelope hostage in the cockpit, Foster intends to abandon the others, but Alan shoots and kills Foster. The Tiger Moth lifts off again with all hanging on to either the wings or undercarriage, just before Skyship One crashes {{to the ground and}} obliterates the evacuated missile base in a chain reaction. A shootout on board the Tiger Moth disposes of the last of the White Ghost agents, but a bullet has penetrated the fuel tank and the controls will not respond to Penelope. After narrow misses with a bridge on the unfinished M104 motorway and an exhaust tower, Alan and Penelope finally manage to ditch the plane into a field with Tin-Tin and Brains unhurt, however they then realise that no-one has seen Parker since Alan shot Foster, leading them to believe he never made it off Skyship One, but a distant voice reveals that he <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a tree the plane crashed through. Back on Tracy Island, Brains unveils Thunderbird 6 as none other than the repaired, repainted and revamped Tiger Moth, which all agree has proven its value as a rescue aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Rewa {{affected}} Papua New Guinea on {{two separate}} occasions {{while it was}} active, with the cyclone first affecting the archipelago between 28December and 1January, before grazing the archipelago between 12-14January. Before Rewa affected the country, cyclone alerts and warnings were issued for Sudest, Rossel and Samarai islands, while authorities urged people {{not to go to}} beaches. As it affected the archipelago, Rewa brought heavy rainfall, high seas, and wind gusts of up to 100km/h (60mph) to parts of the archipelago including Sudest, Rossel and Samarai islands. The hardest hit areas were communities near major river systems, with the cyclone blocking roads, destroying a church, bridges, homes and gardens with vital crops such as coffee and copra destroyed. In total, Cyclone Rewa left around 3500people homeless and caused 17deaths, 8 of which were due to flooding. Nine other people went missing while travelling to Rossel Island after their boat <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> high seas associated with Rewa. They were later presumed dead by the National Disaster and Emergency Service, after a local search and rescue mission found wreckage of the boat. At 00:00UTC on 30December, the automatic weather station at Jingo on Rossel island recorded a maximum sustained wind of 55km/h (35mph).|$|E
5|$|The fourth caution {{was given}} on lap 174 when Montoya {{collided}} with the wall, damaging his car. Edwards, who was hit by Montoya, had sustained a similar amount of damage to his car. Keselowski <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the crash, and Jeff Gordon was forced to spin sideways. None of the leaders made pit stops during the caution. Officials cleared the surface at turn one and checked turn two for a brake motor. The race restarted on lap 181 with Kyle Busch leading, ahead of Kurt Busch, and Reutimann. Five laps later, Kyle Busch had built up a 1.4 second lead. On lap 206, Reed Sorenson damaged his car, after colliding with the wall, which caused the fifth and final caution. Most of the leaders made pit stops for fuel and car adjustments during the caution. Kyle Busch led on the restart on lap 212, followed by Kurt Busch and Reutimann. Seven laps later, Kahne moved into ninth position. On lap 221, Earnhardt. dropped two positions to seventh. Eight laps later, Martin moved into the fifth position.

5|$|Diane {{remained}} {{in love with}} Victor, and stole his frozen sperm to artificially inseminate herself. Unbeknownst to her, Ashley had also stolen Victor’s sperm to inseminate herself. Diane gave birth to Christian Victor Newman, but was shocked to discover the sperm she’d stolen was that of Jack. Ashley had received Victor’s actual sperm sample and gives birth to Abby Carlton, whom she decides to pass off as Brad’s child. Victor and Nikki later reunite, and in 2002, Maxwell Hollister (Sam Behrens) attempts to destroy Victor, using his estranged wife, revealed to be Lorie Brooks, in his plot. Originally, Max attempted to lead a hostile takeover of Julia Newman Martin's design firm, which Victor prevented. Now, Max used Lorie to keep Victor and Nikki apart, but Lorie could not follow through, and a ruined Max ends up leaving town. Months after, Victor and Nikki remarry {{in front of all}} of their loved ones. Ashley reveals that Abby is in fact Victor’s daughter as she was diagnosed with cancer, and he welcomes her with open arms.
