5|$|Whoever {{looks in}} the past and thinks about the time of 1919 to 1932 will be {{overpowered}} by great pain {{in the face of the}} mistakes that have been made. When Hitler published his book Mein Kampf, it was time to begin the most stringent battle against the theories proposed in that book. Hitler proposed to do away with all present parties and institutions, even those brought about after centuries of sacrifices and great exertion. What would a man do if a thief announced a proposed break-in? Anybody would make security arrangements. And <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> government and the representatives of the people do? As much as nothing. A tired, weak and sick population, as well as a weak government, let a charlatan of the worst sort promise them healing. For every problem this quack had the only right medicine. He alone possessed the magic wand that would uproot human weakness and produce angels.|$|E

God?—needed us to be there, but the need felt neurotic and uncompassionate. In “We Love You Carol and Alison” (my favorite Game Theory song) I'm trying to express that teen alienation thing that the kids go for, but I’m also fishing around for a basis of proper adulthood.|$|E

2500|$|Leslie J. Hoppe, {{writing in}} 1987, submits that Dever's {{definition}} of temporal scope of Levantine archaeology excludes the Early Arab period (640-1099), the Crusader period (1099–1291), the Mamluk period (1250–1517) and the Ottoman period (1517-1918). However, Dever's {{definition of the}} temporal scope of the field in <b>What</b> <b>Did</b> <b>the</b> Biblical Writers Know, and When Did They Know It? (2001), indicates that Hoppe's critique is no longer valid. There, Dever writes that the time-frame of Levantine archaeology, [...] "extends far beyond the 'biblical period,' embracing everything from the Lower Paleolithic to the Ottoman period." ...|$|E

Then think about what the leadership did about it. It doesn't have to be complicated. What happened, and <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> leaders do about it? That's your book." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 1977 Andrew Pendlebury left Myriad to join an R, rockabilly group, The Sports. The Sports {{had formed}} a year earlier with Stephen Cummings on lead vocals, Ed Bates on guitar, Paul Hitchins on drums, Robert Glover (ex-Myriad) on bass guitar and Jim Niven on piano. Upon joining Pendlebury also {{assisted}} Cummings with songwriting. The band released their first album, Reckless, in 1978 on Mushroom Records, which peaked at No.43 on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart. It provided four charting singles, [...] "Boys! (<b>What</b> <b>Did</b> <b>the</b> Dective Say)" [...] (No.55), [...] "When You Walk in the Room" [...] (No.42), [...] "Who Listens to the Radio?" [...] (No.35) and [...] "Reckless". [...] "Who Listens to the Radio?", co-written by Cummings and Pendlebury, was their only hit on the United States Billboard Pop Singles chart, peaking at No.45 in November 1979.|$|E

2500|$|Late in 1992 Hot Records issued re-mastered CD {{versions}} of the band's first five albums. The group returned to Hot Records which released Yizgarnnoff (May 1993) – a second live album – and Sofa – a 20-track compilation (December 1993). In late 1993, Rieth and Steedman joined Deniz Tek to record his album, Outside (1994). Rieth and Steedman toured with The Deniz Tek Group {{over the next few}} years and recorded another album in 1996, Le Bonne Route. In April 1994 The Celibate Rifles issued Spaceman in a Satin Suit which according to McFarlane [...] "was [...] best studio album since Blind Ear". It was produced by Phil Punch and Paul Tagg. The band contributed a cover of The Sports' [...] "Boys! (<b>What</b> <b>Did</b> <b>the</b> Detective Say?)" [...] to the various artists project Earth Music.
