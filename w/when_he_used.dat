25|$|The low ISO {{rating of}} the sheet film Weston used necessitated very long {{exposures}} when using his view camera, ranging from 1 to 3 seconds for outdoor landscape exposures to as long as 4½ hours for still lifes such as peppers or shells. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> one of the Graflex cameras the exposure times were much shorter (usually less than ¼ second), and he was sometimes able to work without a tripod.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the late}} nineteenth century, breast {{implants}} {{have been used to}} surgically augment the size (volume), modify the shape (contour), and enhance the feel (tact) of a woman’s breasts. In 1895, surgeon Vincenz Czerny effected the earliest breast implant emplacement <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> the patient's autologous adipose tissue, harvested from a benign lumbar lipoma, to repair the asymmetry of the breast from which he had removed a tumor. In 1889, surgeon Robert Gersuny experimented with paraffin injections, with disastrous results.|$|E

25|$|Martin's strong pro-Tory {{political}} views eventually caused his downfall, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> {{his position in}} Parliament as member for Plymouth, {{for which he had}} been elected in July 1818, to publicly criticise the new Whig government of Earl Grey in 1830. Infuriated, Grey and Sir James Graham, who had become First Lord of the Admiralty that year, approached Martin's old friend King William IV for a solution, resulting in Martin's dismissal for insubordination in 1831. In his later years he lived at No. 53 Wimpole Street in London.|$|E
25|$|The {{career of}} writer-producer Fred Barron began in 1975 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> {{the history of}} Cambridge’s The Real Paper {{as the basis for}} a screenplay, Between the Lines. When Joan Micklin Silver brought Hester Street (1975) to the Welles Cinema, she was joined at the Welles Restaurant by Barron and others. When someone asked what she would direct next, she {{answered}} that she was looking at screenplays. Barron stood up, left the restaurant and returned with his screenplay. The success of Between the Lines (1977) led to a short-lived television series, also titled Between the Lines.|$|E

He placed copies of the Bible alongside the bodies {{of his wife and}} son, as well as a third Bible on his weight lifting machine. Since Benoit's suicide, numerous explanations for his actions have been proposed, including brain damage, steroid abuse, and a failing marriage. The incident led to numerous media accounts, and a federal investigation into steroid abuse in professional wrestling.|$|E

25|$|Palladio was to {{transform}} the architectural style of both palaces and churches by taking a different perspective {{on the notion of}} Classicism. While the architects of Florence and Rome looked to structures like the Colosseum and the Arch of Constantine to provide formulae, Palladio looked to classical temples with their simple peristyle form. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> the “triumphal arch” motif of a large arched opening with lower square-topped opening on either side, he invariably applied it on a small scale, such as windows, rather than on a large scale as Alberti used it at Sant’Andrea’s. This Ancient Roman motif {{is often referred to as}} the Palladian Arch.|$|E
25|$|Ralea's {{literary}} columns {{very often}} promoted modernist writers, or modernist interpretations of classical ones, such as <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> Janet's psychology {{to explain the}} genesis of works by Thomas Hardy. More famous was his reading of Proust through Henri Bergson's classification of memory. Ralea offered much praise to rationalist modernists such as Alexandru A. Philippide, and hailed Tudor Arghezi, the eclectic modernizer of poetic language, as Romania's greatest poet of the day. Ralea (and, before him, Ibrăileanu) campaigned for social realism in prose. His natural favorite was Sadoveanu, {{but he was also}} enthusiastic about modernist novels with a flavor of social radicalism, including those by Sburătoruls Hortensia Papadat-Bengescu.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous early use was by Enrico Fermi in 1930, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> a random method to {{calculate}} {{the properties of the}} newly discovered neutron. Monte Carlo methods were central to the simulations required for the Manhattan Project, though were severely limited by the computational tools at the time. Therefore, it was only after electronic computers were first built (from 1945 on) that Monte Carlo methods began to be studied in depth. In the 1950s they were used at Los Alamos for early work relating {{to the development of the}} hydrogen bomb, and became popularized in the fields of physics, physical chemistry, and operations research. The RAND Corporation and the U.S. Air Force were two of the major organizations responsible for funding and disseminating information on Monte Carlo methods during this time, and they began to find a wide application in many different fields.|$|E
