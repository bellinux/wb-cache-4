5|$|<b>Wristwatches</b> {{were first}} worn by {{military}} men {{towards the end}} of the nineteenth century, when the importance of synchronizing manoeuvres during war without potentially revealing the plan to the enemy through signalling was increasingly recognized. It was clear that using pocket watches while in the heat of battle or while mounted on a horse was impractical, so officers began to strap the watches to their wrist. The Garstin Company of London patented a 'Watch Wristlet' design in 1893, although they were probably producing similar designs from the 1880s. Clearly, a market for men's <b>wristwatches</b> was coming into being at the time. Officers in the British Army began using <b>wristwatches</b> during colonial military campaigns in the 1880s, such as during the Anglo-Burma War of 1885.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} the First World War {{dramatically}} shifted public perceptions on the propriety of the man's wristwatch, and opened up a mass market in the post-war era. The creeping barrage artillery tactic, developed during the War, required precise synchronization between the artillery gunners and the infantry advancing behind the barrage. Service watches produced during the War were specially designed for the rigours of trench warfare, with luminous dials and unbreakable glass. <b>Wristwatches</b> were also found to be needed {{in the air as}} much as on the ground: military pilots found them more convenient than pocket watches for the same reasons as Santos-Dumont had. The British War Department began issuing <b>wristwatches</b> to combatants from 1917.|$|E
5|$|During the Boer War, the {{importance}} of coordinating troop movements and synchronizing attacks against the highly mobile Boer insurgents was paramount, {{and the use of}} <b>wristwatches</b> subsequently became widespread among the officer class. The company Mappin & Webb began production of their successful 'campaign watch' for soldiers during the campaign at the Sudan in 1898 and ramped up production for the Boer War a few years later.|$|E
40|$|This {{observation}} has purposes to {{know the}} ways of persuasion language expressed in <b>wristwatch</b> advertisement in Time Magazine and to describe the meaning of persuasive language used in <b>wristwatch</b> advertisement in Time Magazine. In this research, the data are derived from the English text in <b>wristwatch</b> advertisement that containing word, phrase, clause or sentence. There are two techniques in collecting the data, firstly the writer reads the English advertisement in Time Magazine especially the <b>wristwatch</b> advertisement; secondly the writer lists and collects phrases or sentence of the <b>wristwatch</b> advertisement in Time Magazine. And then the writer uses persuasive technique in language to get the ways persuasive language expressed and using contextual meaning {{to know the}} meaning of persuasive language. Based on the data analysis, the writer draws conclusion that there are eight ways to express persuasive language in <b>wristwatch</b> advertisement at Time magazine. They are intensifier, imperative, rhetorical question, repetition, simile, metaphor, short cut, and temporal language. And then related to the meaning, the meaning used to express persuasive presents by using superiority of <b>wristwatch,</b> prestige of <b>wristwatch,</b> the quality of <b>wristwatch</b> and the freedom of wearer to set the <b>wristwatch</b> as their want. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{pendulum}} clock {{remained the}} most accurate timekeeper until the 1930s, when quartz oscillators were invented, followed by atomic clocks after World War 2. Although initially limited to laboratories, the development of microelectronics in the 1960s made quartz clocks both compact and cheap to produce, and by the 1980s they became the world's dominant timekeeping technology in both clocks and <b>wristwatches.</b>|$|E
5|$|The term 'clock' {{encompasses}} {{a wide spectrum}} of devices, ranging from <b>wristwatches</b> to the Clock of the Long Now. The English word clock is said to derive from the Middle English clokke, Old North French cloque, or Middle Dutch clocke, all of which mean bell, and are derived from the Medieval Latin clocca, also meaning bell. Indeed, bells were used to mark the passage of time; they marked the passage of the hours at sea and in abbeys.|$|E

5|$|These early {{models were}} {{essentially}} standard pocket-watches fitted to a leather strap, {{but by the}} early 20th century, manufacturers began producing purpose-built <b>wristwatches.</b> The Swiss company, Dimier Frères & Cie patented a wristwatch design with the now standard wire lugs in 1903. In 1904, Alberto Santos-Dumont, an early aviator, asked his friend, a French watchmaker called Louis Cartier, to design a watch that could be useful during his flights.|$|E

Meanwhile, Scott Garrett, a Man in Black posing as an NTSB investigator, steals the zip gun from the assassin's body and erases his face and fingerprints with acid. Larold Rehbun, a passenger who sat next to Max, is found alive. His injuries indicate exposure to radiation.|$|E
5|$|Manstein {{did nothing}} to prevent the killing of Jews and other civilians in the areas where his units were operating, and in which his Eleventh Army {{actively}} participated. That Manstein {{was well aware of}} the Einsatzgruppen massacres is demonstrated by a 1941 letter he sent to Otto Ohlendorf, in which Manstein demands Ohlendorf hand over the <b>wristwatches</b> of murdered Jews. Manstein felt his men deserved the watches, since they were doing so much to help Ohlendorf's men with their work. Smelser and Davies note that this letter was the only time that Manstein ever complained about the activities of the Einsatzgruppen. Manstein later stated that he felt the number of Jews killed in the Holocaust was exaggerated.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept of}} the {{wristwatch}} {{goes back to the}} production of the very earliest watches in the 16th century. Elizabeth I of England received a wristwatch from Robert Dudley in 1571, described as an arm watch. From the beginning, wrist watches were almost exclusively worn by women, while men used pocket-watches up until the early 20th century. This was {{not just a matter of}} fashion or prejudice; watches of the time were notoriously prone to fouling from exposure to the elements, and could only reliably be kept safe from harm if carried securely in the pocket. When the waistcoat was introduced as a manly fashion at the court of Charles II in the 17th century, the pocket watch was tucked into its pocket. Prince Albert, the consort to Queen Victoria, introduced the 'Albert chain' accessory, designed to secure the pocket watch to the man's outergarment by way of a clip. By the mid nineteenth century, most watchmakers produced a range of <b>wristwatches,</b> often marketed as bracelets, for women.|$|E
25|$|The Chanel {{wristwatch}} {{division was}} established in 1987. In 1995, division presented a second design, the Matelassé.

25|$|Some <b>wristwatches</b> are {{powered by}} kinetic energy (called {{automatic}} watches), {{in this case}} movement of the arm is used. The arm movement causes winding of its mainspring. A newer design introduced by Seiko ("Kinetic") uses movement of a magnet in the electromagnetic generator instead to power the quartz movement. The motion provides a rate of change of flux, which results in some induced emf on the coils. The concept is simply related to Faraday's Law.|$|E
