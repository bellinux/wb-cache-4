5|$|After {{the power}} outage was over, Hydro-Québec made {{numerous}} upgrades to its system {{in order to}} improve the power grid. Examples include the strengthening of electrical pylons and power poles, and increasing the power supply. This <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> enable the utility to restore power more rapidly {{in the case of a}} massive ice striking Quebec again. Hydro-Québec has stated that it is better-prepared to handle an ice storm with the same magnitude as the one of 1998.|$|E
5|$|Amanita ceciliae is {{considered}} an edible mushroom and used as food, although many field guides recommend to avoid eating it. Others recommend it as a good edible species. A study of 16 edible mushrooms <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> learn about their chemical compositions and antioxidant activities. Among these species, A.ceciliae and Pleurotus ostreatus were the two mushrooms that showed most powerful radical scavenging activities.|$|E

The episode ends with a final flashback of Bill Mulder driving down a road with Skur and giving Skur the keys to the car and walking away.|$|E
5|$|Both the {{external}} walls and those around the keep were fitted with merlons and parapets, with the parapets of the keep positioned 6.5 meters higher {{than their counterparts}} along {{the external}} wall. This <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> establish a secondary defensive line that enabled the building's defenders to shoot arrows at attackers who breached the external walls.

5|$|In 1988, Larry Livermore, {{owner of}} Lookout! Records, saw the band play an early show and signed {{the group to}} his label. In 1989, the band {{recorded}} its debut extended play, 1,000 Hours. Before 1,000 Hours was released, the group dropped the name Sweet Children; according to Livermore, this <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> avoid confusion with another local band Sweet Baby. The band adopted the name Green Day, due to the members' fondness for cannabis.|$|E

The music was composed by Rajesh Roshan, with the background score by Salim-Sulaiman. Filming <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> a large extent in Singapore as well as India.|$|E
5|$|Over these centuries, {{the city}} {{suffered}} numerous assaults. In the 13th century, Mongol forces destroyed a nine-story wooden pagoda at Hwangnyongsa. During the Japanese invasions of Korea, the Gyeongju area became a heated battlefield, and Japanese forces burned the wooden structures at Bulguksa. Not all damage {{was due to}} invasions, however. In the early Joseon period, {{a great deal of}} damage <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> Buddhist sculptures on Namsan by Neo-Confucian radicals, who hacked arms and heads off statuary.|$|E

5|$|The Luftwaffe {{began its}} eighth {{consecutive}} night of bombing London on 15 September. Soon after midnight, 13 unidentified Dornier Do 17 light bombers attacked the capital. At 00:15 two Junkers Ju 88s followed from Kampfgeschwader 51 (KG 51, or 51st Bomber Wing). A further 11 Heinkel He 111s from an unidentified unit bombed the city again at 00:50. At 02:00, five He 111s from Kampfgeschwader 4 (KG 4) bombed the city. A full strike by the Geschwader had been planned, but bad weather had forced a cancellation after five He 111s had taken off. Most {{of the damage}} <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> residential areas in Fulham, Chelsea and Westminster. Around 19 {{people were killed and}} 31 injured. The heaviest casualties were caused when a bomb fell on a church in Chelsea killing 14 and injuring 26. Small raiding forces bombed Cardiff, Bootle (in Liverpool), Leicester and Ipswich. At Bootle, only slight damage <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> rail tracks and facilities at West Alexandra Dock.|$|E

5|$|A round Norman-style apse {{was added}} to the church in 1868, the architects being the Lancaster {{partnership}} of Paley and Austin. The incumbent, the Rev. Thomas Clarke, paid for this addition, but died before its construction was complete. Architect J.S.Crowther oversaw further alterations in 1881–83; a baptistery was built, the organ was moved and choir stalls were built in the chancel. Some work <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> the interior of the tower in 1908. Renovations in 1955 included the addition of a central aisle and the removal of some of the church furnishings. The Victorian pulpit was replaced. A small extension was added north of the tower in 2005.|$|E

Gissing's body is still in the morgue and Dales convinces the technician to cut open the body where they find a strange creature has been sewn into Gissing's chest. Dales goes to Skur's wife and tells her what <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> her husband and that he wants to expose the experiments.

5|$|A {{special session}} of the {{legislature}} in 1965 changed the Senate to represent 16 districts and reapportioned the seats, again by county, but did so {{in such a way}} as to make the representation more proportional to population than it had been. Thus, the eastern shore, which had previously elected nine Senators, elected only four after 1965. This <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> preserve the ideal of having whole counties represented by a single Senator, rather than breaking counties up into multiple districts. A constitutional amendment in 1972 expanded the Senate to 47 members, elected from districts proportional to the population. These districts are reapportioned every ten years based on the United States Census to ensure they remain proportional.|$|E
5|$|According to Swedish legend, Charles XI {{travelled}} {{around the}} country dressed as a farmer or simple traveller. In the legend he {{is referred to as}} the Greycoat (Swedish: Gråkappan).

There are many stories about him arriving in villages looking for corrupt church officials and sending them to the gallows. However, Charles XI never travelled alone. He was always followed by a military cortège but he was one of the kings in Sweden during this era that travelled the most throughout the country. The stories of the Greycoat were published in a book by Arvid August Afzelius in the middle of the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|After the work-ins had ended, work {{continued}} on finishing the cap which {{was scheduled for}} lift-on in October. The weather hampered the work initially, but {{the application of a}} modern microporous paint, designed to withstand normal movement of the timber and yet remain waterproof, was completed in time for the lift-on. A mini work-in was held the weekend before the cap was lifted, with 17 people participating over the weekend. Final work <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> the cap and a new window was fitted to the stone floor of the mill. The tarpaulin was removed and the trammel dismantled. The 5-ton cap was lifted into place by a mobile crane on 24 October 1983, watched by a crowd of some 70 people. The fitting of the cap was toasted with beer from Adnams Brewery, Southwold.|$|E
