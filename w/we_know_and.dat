25|$|In {{fact the}} essence of her art was refinement. The term seems odd for a {{performer}} whose imagination and means of expression were so prodigious. She was eminently capable of the grand gesture; still, judging strictly from the evidence of her recordings, <b>we</b> <b>know</b> (<b>and</b> her few existing film clips confirm) that her power flowed not from excess but from unbroken concentration, unfaltering truth in the moment. It flowed also from irreproachable musicianship. People say that Callas would not hesitate to distort a vocal line for dramatic effect. In the throes of operatic passion plenty of singers snarl, growl, whine, and shriek. Callas {{was not one of}} them. She found all she needed in the notes.|$|E

Described as Apogee's president and chief engineer, he said, [...] "digital is finally living up to the warm, natural sound of analogue that <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>and</b> love." [...] A decade later, he warned against the belief that bigger specification numbers guarantee better sound quality. He noted that 192kHz sampling rate was often cited as being better than 96kHz because of it being twice as fast [...] "when in reality there's {{a whole bunch of}} other influencing factors responsible for any audible improvements." ...|$|E

500|$|Strasburg's {{high profile}} {{and the success}} of the Nationals in the 2012 season made the innings limit a topic of {{national}} conversation. In addition to baseball writers, a number of other figures made their views on the topic known, including football broadcasters Troy Aikman and Terry Bradshaw, basketball reporter Stephen A. Smith, and even prominent politicians such as Rudy Giuliani and Mitch McConnell. Rizzo [...] defended the decision to shut down Strasburg and criticized the buzz surrounding it: [...] "It's a good conversational piece, it's a good debatable subject. But most of the people that have weighed in on this know probably 10 percent of the information that <b>we</b> <b>know,</b> <b>and</b> that we've made our opinion based upon." ...|$|E

When he was asked to surrender, Crillon told the enemy general that he could not as he had a name and a personal reputation to defend. The general is said to have replied, [...] "Sir, <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>and</b> believe [...] {{since the beginning of the}} campaign; but give up, brave Crillon, you will be taken."

500|$|Both studio co-founder Jordan Weisman and {{executive}} producer Ray Winninger had experience developing both tabletop games and video games. One of the studio's motivations for developing the game was to combine the two mediums, with Winninger explaining [...] "One of the spaces we're interested in exploring at Harebrained, and Golem is the first effort, is how can we take those tabletop games that <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>and</b> love so much and leverage technology to enhance that experience in some way." [...] Weisman and Winninger also stressed the social nature of the game. Winninger, comparing Golem Arcana to Skylanders, another game with both physical and digital components, stressed that Golem Arcana was less focused on components and more focused on the social experience. Weisman pointed to his disappointment that [...] "kids' idea of playing together after school these days usually means just meeting online from their own houses" [...] in stressing that participants playing {{against each other in}} Golem Arcana would do so face-to-face.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by series co-creators Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld and {{directed}} by Tom Cherones. David based the story on a personal experience of his, when he gave a ride home {{to a woman who}} had recently dated a friend of his. He would frequently come up with the idea for an episode and make it into a teleplay with Seinfeld's help; in a 1991 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Seinfeld stated: [...] "Most of the stories are from [...] life. He just has a tremendous wellspring of ideas. I mean, he just fills notebooks with ideas and I try to help him, but Larry is really the designer of the show." [...] David Sims of The A.V. Club commented, [...] "Seinfeld started its second season, its first real season after a four-episode test run, very strongly with [...] "The Ex-Girlfriend", and {{it is the first time}} we really see George as the character <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>and</b> love, that weird dark shadow of Larry David's mind who behaves as no functioning human being honestly could." ...|$|E

[...] Both commented that although Spears arrived late to the recording sessions, she caught them off guard with her efficiency and professionalism, with Lewis adding, [...] "It was absolutely nuts, and she took directions very well.

500|$|... "No Time for It" [...] {{received}} a mixed response from music critics upon its release. Jeff Benjamin of Fuse {{called it a}} [...] "lush kiss-off track".

Matthew Scott Donnelly commended the song as [...] "setting a brand new era into motion", calling it [...] "breezy-yet-declarative" [...] and [...] "a here-I-am declaration". [...] "No Time for It" [...] {{was identified as a}} sign of an R revival by reviewers from the Omaha World-Herald and Essence. A writer from the Omaha World-Hearld concluded by praising Fantasia for her [...] "powerful, soulful vocals". Maura Johnston included the song on her [...] "Best Songs of 2016 So Far" [...] list. Writing for PopCrush, Matthew Scott Donnelly compared the single favorably to the music of Kelly Rowland, calling it [...] "sunny but playfully sinister". Reviewing the album for the Knoxville News Sentinel, Chuck Campbell praised [...] "No Time for It" [...] as [...] "smoothly arranged and spiked with her vocals" [...] and suggested it as an answer for listeners [...] "tired of all life's drama".|$|E

500|$|PolyGram and Working Title Films, who had funded Fargo, backed The Big Lebowski with {{a budget}} of $15million. In casting the film, Joel remarked, [...] "we tend to write both for people <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>and</b> have worked with, and some parts without knowing who's {{going to play the}} role. In The Big Lebowski we did write for John [...] and Steve , but we didn't know who was getting the Jeff Bridges role." [...] In {{preparation}} for his role, Bridges met Dowd but actually [...] "drew on myself a lot from back in the Sixties and Seventies. I lived in a little place like that and did drugs, although I think I was a little more creative than the Dude." [...] The actor went into his own closet with the film's wardrobe person and picked out clothes that he had thought the Dude might wear. He wore his character's clothes home because most of them were his own. The actor also adopted the same physicality as Dowd, including the slouching and his ample belly. Originally, Goodman wanted a different kind of beard for Walter but the Coen brothers insisted on the [...] "Gladiator" [...] or what they called the [...] "Chin Strap" [...] and he thought it would go well with his flattop haircut.|$|E
500|$|Various {{historians have}} given Adams {{recognition}} {{as an important}} figure from {{the early years of}} baseball. Thorn has written that he [...] "may be counted as first among the Fathers of Baseball." [...] O'Maxfield said of Adams: [...] "Without , we wouldn't have the game <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>and</b> love as baseball today." [...] The [...] "father" [...] label was rejected by Ryczek; he wrote that Adams did not conceive the sport, but called him a [...] "collaborator" [...] in its development. On July 31, 2014, the Society for American Baseball Research announced that it had chosen Adams as its 2014 [...] "Overlooked 19th Century Baseball Legend". Eric Miklich has called him worthy of induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame for his role as a pioneer. He says of Adams, [...] "Should he be in the Hall of Fame? Absolutely. You ask anyone who knows about 19th century baseball. They'll laugh at Cartwright; Abner Doubleday, they won't even talk about; but they all know Doc Adams. He was the glue that held things together {{in the early part of}} baseball." [...] Adams did not appear on a Baseball Hall of Fame ballot until 2016, when he was up for consideration on the Hall's Pre-Integration Era Committee ballot. Ten of the 16 committee members supported him, two fewer than the number needed for induction.|$|E
500|$|Francis {{received}} generally negative {{reviews for}} her portrayal. Jamey Giddens of Zap2it {{wrote of the}} decision to sign Francis onto the series: [...] "Maria Arena Bell just made Brian Frons kick a puppy in the face." [...] After her debut, he called Francis' portrayal of Genevieve [...] "embarrassingly-bad", stating: [...] "I'm sure I will catch hell for going here about a daytime treasure, but Francis' portrayal of Cane and Caleb's (Daniel Goddard) unhinged mother has been cartoonish and abysmal from her first air show. I don't know if Francis is painfully attempting to channel the late Elizabeth Taylor’s fun, campy turn as Luke and Laura's arch nemesis Helena Cassadine on General Hospital 30 years ago, or going for Evil-Lyn from the old He-Man and the Masters of the Universe cartoon, but she's missing the mark either way." [...] He also wrote that as much as he would [...] "love to solely blame this performance on the writing—because let’s face it, the story is dreadful—Francis is the one making the choices to jerk, gasp and wince as Genevieve registers each and every emotion or painful memory. This is not the Genie Francis <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>and</b> love." [...] Adam Hughes of Yahoo! wrote of viewers' reactions to Francis' debut and her portrayal, stating: [...] "Since Francis arrived on the scene this spring, fan reaction to her revised on-screen attitude has been a mixed bag, but she continues to draw a ton of interest to her new CBS television digs. Former General Hospital followers may find her more biting character hard to swallow, and longtime fans of The Young and The Restless have watched her push aside some of their favorites, but Francis has undoubtedly shaken up the local landscape. Buzz is half the game when comes to keeping soap opera fans interested, and Francis has certainly delivered that." ...|$|E

500|$|The main {{instrumentation}} {{was recorded}} by Bloodshy & Avant at Bloodshy & Avant Studios in Stockholm, Sweden.

[...] "Radar" [...] was originally planned to be released as the third single from Blackout, according to Lewis. [...] "Break the Ice" [...] was released instead and [...] "Radar" [...] was chosen as the fourth single. In July 2008, a CD single was released in countries such as New Zealand and Sweden. However, a wider release was scrapped when Spears began recording new material for her sixth studio album, Circus. On May 7, 2009, the song was announced as the fourth single from Circus.|$|E
500|$|MTV's Kevin P. Sullivan {{summarized}} the episode as follows: [...] "When all {{was said and}} done, it was another tribute episode, something that can't be uttered by a Glee fan without a sigh and an eye roll." [...] Bell noted that tribute episodes usually mean that [...] "all sense of plot continuity" [...] is forgone, but that this one ranked [...] "at the top {{of all of the}} other Glee tribute episodes because even though it was absurd at times, at least there was a plot—and it kind of made sense". Futterman was more complimentary and described it as the [...] "most effortless tribute episode yet", and Canning wrote that [...] "with songs <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>and</b> love and storylines that actually connected and delivered some meaningful and moving moments" [...] it was [...] "more than just a theme episode". Jen Chaney of The Washington Post, however, thought that it was very much like previous tributes in that it also [...] "featured scattered plot lines engineered to include as many songs by said artists as possible" [...] and also [...] "glorified their respective pop stars’ images to an absurd degree". The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff also noted the glorification of Jackson, and noted [...] "every time the show turns into an episode about Michael Jackson, it stops dead in its tracks entirely". He stated that what was [...] "weird" [...] about the episode was that [...] "what didn’t work was the spectacle, while what did work were the smaller, character-based stories" [...] which [...] "provided a spine some of the other spectacle-oriented episodes have lacked". Futterman was one of many reviewers who took note of a new feature of this tribute episode when she commented on the [...] "initial whiff of product placement and forced timing" [...] related to the [...] "Immortal World Tour" [...] dialogue. Rae Votta of Billboard thought the inclusion a [...] "brilliant bit of marketing synergy", but TVLine Michael Slezak called it [...] "ridiculously unsubtle product-placement".|$|E
500|$|Radio Times {{reviewer}} Patrick Mulkern {{likened the}} character to Brigitte Nyborg (Sidse Babett Knudsen) in the Danish series Borgen, {{explaining that the}} two [...] "form a very small club of politicians in TV drama who are hugely sympathetic, female and enjoy a rapid rise to PM". Mulkern felt that Wilton was [...] "a major saving grace" [...] in the [...] "disappointing" [...] "Aliens of London" [...] / [...] "World War Three". The Daily Telegraphs Hugh Davies commented {{on a number of}} political allusions made through Jones's characterisation as Prime Minister in [...] "The Christmas Invasion". He felt that her rebuttal of aid from the US president after aliens invade is a [...] "swipe at Blair and Bush over the invasion of Iraq". He also compared Jones's destruction of the fleeing Sycorax—a decision heavily criticised by the Doctor—to Margaret Thatcher's decision to sink the Argentine warship General Belgrano during the Falklands War. Russell T Davies responded to observations of political commentary by stating that there is [...] "absolutely an anti-war message" [...] present in the episode due to Christmas being [...] "a day of peace". In their unauthorised guide to Doctor Who, Graeme Burk and Robert Smith felt that Wilton delivered the [...] "standout performance" [...] of the Christmas special" [...] stating that, whilst the character remained recognisable, it was [...] "fascinating watching her harder edge emerge from the woman <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>and</b> love". Of Harriet Jones's development, Stuart Galbrainth of DVD Talk felt that she begins as a [...] "charming neophyte minister" [...] but becomes [...] "suddenly much less charming at the end of [...] "Christmas Invasion," [...] when she becomes just another politician". However, Cliff Chapman of Den of Geek felt that the episode's denouement was flawed by trying to [...] "make out that Harriet Jones is awful for doing something perfectly reasonable." [...] Similarly, io9's Chris Cummins commented that the character had [...] "noble intentions" [...] and that she was proved right upon her return in the fourth series.|$|E
