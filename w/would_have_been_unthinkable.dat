5|$|Ragusa Ibla, {{the lower}} city, boasts an {{impressive}} array of Baroque architecture, which includes the Church of San Giorgio by Rosario Gagliardi, designed in 1738 (Illustration 12). In the design of this church Gagliardi exploited the difficult terrain of the hillside site. The church towers impressively over a massive marble staircase of some 250 steps, a Baroque feature, especially exploited in Sicily due to the island's topography. The tower seems to explode from the façade, accentuated by the columns and pilasters canted against the curved walls. Above the doorways and window apertures, pediments scroll and curve with a sense of freedom and movement which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>unthinkable</b> to those earlier architects inspired by Bernini and Borromini. The neoclassical dome was not added until 1820.|$|E

25|$|The Saint {{starring}} Val Kilmer {{was made}} in 1997 but diverged far from the Charteris books, although it did revive Templar's use of aliases. Kilmer's Saint is unable to defeat a Russian gangster in hand-to-hand combat and is forced to flee; this <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>unthinkable</b> in a Charteris tale. Whereas the original Saint resorted to aliases that had the initials S.T., Kilmer's character used Christian saints, regardless of initials. This Saint refrained from killing, and even the main villains live to stand trial, whereas Charteris's version had no qualms about taking another life. Kilmer's Saint {{is presented as a}} master of disguise, but Charteris's version hardly used the sophisticated ones shown in this film. The film mirrored aspects of Charteris's own life, notably his origins in the Far East, though not in an orphanage as the film portrayed. Sir Roger Moore features throughout in cameo as the BBC Newsreader heard in Simon Templar's Volvo.|$|E

Cars offered were usually superminis, from makers like Daihatsu and Daewoo, or models like a Ford Ka or Mazda Demio, but small sports cars like a Hyundai Accent or Vauxhall Tigra were offered on occasion.|$|R
25|$|In 1963, O'Neill succeeded Viscount Brookeborough as Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. He {{introduced}} {{new policies}} that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>unthinkable</b> with Brookeborough as Prime Minister. He aimed to end sectarianism {{and to bring}} Catholics and Protestants into working relationships. A visit to a convent proved controversial among many Protestants. He also had aspirations in the industrial sector, seeking improved relations with the trade union movement and attracting new investment from abroad to replace failing industry in Northern Ireland. O'Neill seemed to strongly believe in industrialisation and modernisation. However {{it is clear that}} he was in some ways trying to prevent the Northern Ireland Labour Party (NILP) from gaining ground. Northern Ireland was influenced by British politics so the arrival of Harold Wilson in Downing Street meant the NILP had a significant ally there. Wilson was not a committed UUP supporter, so that O'Neill was the first Prime Minister of Northern Ireland who could not rely on the support of the UK Government.|$|E
25|$|Les Baigneuses is an oil {{painting}} on canvas with dimensions 105 x 171cm (41.3 by 67.3 inches), signed Albert Gleizes and dated 1912, lower left. This work, painted {{at the outset}} of 1912, represents a series of naked elegant women at various points in the landscape foreground, their reflections along with the blue of the sky echoing off the water at the lower edge of the canvas. Beyond the bathers can be observed protruding rock-like formations or boulders—with highlights of primary color—that appear to espouse elements of the foreground. Above these cliffs are found several deciduous woody plants of the genus Populus. Though native to many areas of the Northern Hemisphere, the Poplar, with its fastigiate branches tapered towards the top, is especially iconic of the western suburbs of Paris (la banlieue ouest) where Gleizes lived, 24 Avenue Gambetta, Courbevoie. The Gleizes family moved to Avenue Gambetta in 1887. Towards the end of the 19th century and extending through the early 20th century, Courbevoie witnessed a rapid growth in population, and a surge in the development of crafts, industry and transport (including rail). Of course, such a scene of naked bathers <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>unthinkable</b> in Courbevoie, or anywhere else near the Parisian capital.|$|E

[...] René Jalbert, the sergeant-at-arms who persuaded Denis Lortie to surrender during his 1984 attack, said that someone should have intervened at least to distract Lépine, but acknowledged that [...] "ordinary citizens cannot be expected to react heroically in the midst of terror." [...] Newspaper columnist Mark Steyn suggested that male inaction during the massacre illustrated a [...] "culture of passivity" [...] prevalent among men in Canada, which enabled Lépine's shooting spree: [...] "Yet the defining image of contemporary Canadian maleness is not M Lepine/Gharbi but the professors and the men in that classroom, who, ordered to leave by the lone gunman, meekly did so, and abandoned their female classmates to their fate—an act of abdication that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>unthinkable</b> in almost any other culture throughout human history." ...|$|E

500|$|As the Confederacy's {{military}} fortunes flagged, {{there was}} increasing consideration of what <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>unthinkable</b> in 1861—enlisting male {{slaves in the}} army and emancipating them for their service. In August 1863, B. H. Micou, a relative of a former law partner, wrote to Benjamin proposing the use of black soldiers. Benjamin responded that this was not feasible, principally for legal and financial reasons, and that the slaves were performing valuable services for the Confederacy where they were. According to Meade, [...] "Benjamin did not offer any objections to Micou's plan except on practical grounds—he was not repelled by the radical nature of the proposal". A British financial agent for the Confederacy, James Spence, also urged emancipation as a means of gaining British recognition. [...] Benjamin allowed Spence to remain in his position for almost a year despite the differences with Confederate policy, before finally dismissing him in late 1863. Despite official neutrality, tens of thousands from British-ruled Ireland were enlisting in the Union cause; Benjamin sent an agent to Ireland hoping to impede those efforts and Dudley Mann to Rome to urge Pope Pius IX to forbid Catholic Irish from enlisting. [...] The Pope did not do so, though he responded sympathetically.|$|E

500|$|For reasons {{including}} expected hostilities with Japan, requiring travel {{across the}} Pacific Ocean, long operational range was a recurrent theme in all US battleship designs. [...] As an experiment, these ships received different powerplants. Delaware received triple-expansion reciprocating engines, while North Dakota was fitted with Curtiss direct drive steam turbine engines.

This estimate was proved true during the ships' trial runs in 1909.

This <b>would</b> normally <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>unthinkable</b> as reciprocating engines were known generally to shake themselves apart if run at full power for long.

40|$|As a {{researcher}} who <b>has</b> long <b>been</b> {{interested in the}} perception, use, and acquisition of language, {{the title of this}} volume, Phonology in Perception, already piques my interest. Closer examination reveals an exciting development: A diverse group of researchers grounded deeply in the discipline of linguistics are grappling with details of the actual human processing of language, something that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> almost <b>unthinkable</b> just a few years ago. Every chapter speaks to issues of processing and learning about spoken language and refers to data from experimental psycholinguistics. These developments lend hope to the idea that the distinction between linguistic and psychological approaches to language will gradually fade away, replaced by an interdisciplinary investigation of language, encompassing the structure, use and acquisition of language and even language change. The remarks I make below are offered in the spirit of hastening this integration. The authors of the various chapters raise a number of issues and questions, either explicitly or implicitly, that {{lie at the heart of}} debates within psychological as well as linguistic circles. - Is language special or does it reflect the operation of domain general principles?- What is built in, and what is learned, about language?- Can phonology be treated separately from the sensory and motor processes that are required for overt communication?- What are the different levels of representation of language, in what form is informatio...|$|R
40|$|In the {{ten years}} that have passed since September 11, 2001, media discourses {{regarding}} Muslims have changed superficially while essentializing stereotypes <b>have</b> <b>been</b> reinforced for the general public. This is true of many forms of media, but this paper focuses on popular television entertainment, {{and the way in}} which this has framed the Muslim woman. Media have had a longstanding fascination with the Muslim woman but this appears to have grown during the war in Afghanistan. Despite greater attention to this subject, the overarching discourses do not seem to be more complex than they were during previous events, such as the 1979 Revolution in Iran. Indeed, portrayals of Muslim women on television are arguably more regressive now than on September 10, 2001. Admittedly, at that time, it <b>would</b> probably <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>unthinkable</b> to imagine a series such as Little Mosque on the Prairie, and this show does constitute a significant source of change. However, when looking at depictions of female Muslim characters on shows such as Little Mosque and other popular network shows from the last ten years, such as 24, it is clear that television after 9 / 11 has not evolved in its depiction of the Muslim woman. Drawing upon existing literature regarding historical depictions, and utilizing a textual analysis of contemporary shows such as 24, Little Mosque on the Prairie and Lost, this paper interrogates the role of entertainment media in advancing pluralist discourses, and investigates the limitations and possibilities of historical and contemporary depictions of Muslim women in such media...|$|R

Only half a century later, this <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> next to <b>unthinkable.</b> In this paper, the disappearance of Moll Flanders, and her supercession in the annals of literary female offenders by heroines like Tess of the d'Urbervilles, serves as a metaphor for fundamental changes in ideas of selfhood, gender and social order in 18 th and 19 th Century England. Drawing on law, literature, philosophy and social history, I argue that these broad changes underpinned a radical shift in mechanisms of responsibility-attribution, with decisive implications for the criminalisation of women. I focus in particular on the question of how the treatment and understanding of female criminality was changing during the era which saw the construction of the main building blocks of the criminal process, and of how these understandings related in turn to broader ideas about gender, social order and individual agency...|$|R

And there may have been better managers, too, if only because his coaching career only lasted 10 and a half years (during which he won 14 trophies, not a bad return).

The question then becomes whether she was motivated to advance her career and assert her independence out of want or need. A good illustration of her often contradictory nature was her desire to remain unmarried for life. This is apparent in her first novel A Family Secret (1876) which creates a vivid image of the role of women in the post war South. She remarks upon the misery inherent in marrying for money and writes at one point [...] "Oh, the slavery it is to be a woman and not a fool." [...] At the same time, Andrews believed that the domestic wife and mother was the only acceptable role for women in Southern society, and she considered teaching [...] "a mental tread-mill, a dull road traveled over and over requiring only patience." [...] On the surface, her ideas seem to be in direct conflict with her accomplishments as a teacher and scholar, but over time she seems to have become more accepting [...] that she could not rescue her beloved antebellum society. As she observed in the introduction to her Wartime Journal that “In the lifetime of a single generation the people of the South have been called upon to pass through changes that the rest of the world has taken centuries to accomplish” she had been assuming a new role in an era where society was experiencing rapid economic and social changes.|$|E

Reviewing the record, The Gramophone said, [...] "The performance of the London Philharmonic Orchestra under Georg Solti (a fine conductor who is new to me) is remarkable for rhythmic playing, richness of tone, and clarity of execution."

40|$|Old age is {{a natural}} part of our lives. Poetically, it is {{considered}} to be its autumn. Aging is a natural process and in nature it can be observed at every living creature. Everything is aging, and also we are becoming old. These days, longevity is an indicator of how much civilized each country is. As a result of quality health care and the development of society, people are living to higher age. These days, men are on average expected to live up to 79 years, women up to 74 years { [...] } figures that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> considered <b>unthinkable</b> in the past. Taking into account these figures, several questions arise: Are we adequately prepared? Do we have, today, a system of care for the elderly to assure a respectable life for us and our parents in future? In the most ideal world, it would be the family or a close relative who would look after the old, ill or the person with limited self-sufficiency. However, this is a very demanding claim on family environment in these nervous and fast-pacing days. My bachelor thesis analyses the question of old age and all the problems it brings. I have attempted to look deeper into the role of a nurse in homecare. The practical part aims to map the role of a nurse in a home-based care and to determine her possibilities (on the basis of a questionnaire technique) in treating the elderly with health problems at home. Another partial goal of this thesis is to ascertain what needs do the ill elderly people have at home and in what ways can the nurse satisfy these needs, and to determine the physical and social strain it creates on the caregiver. After analyzing the results, my conclusion is as follows: The role of a non-professional caregiver is very significant. Family has and will always have an irreplaceable place in the care for its dependant members. There is no way any medical organization can replace the role of a family in the care for its ill family members. Care, especially long-term care, can be both mentally and physically demanding and puts an enormous strain on the caregiver. Caregivers are threatened by the deterioration of family ties, loss of friends, limited social contacts leading up to social isolation, they are prone to suffer from health problems and, in many cases, great exhaustion. The solution is to make use of a home-based care: professional nursing care provided by professional nurses. The purpose of a home-based care is to leave the patient in his/her home environment as long as possible and, at the same time, to provide professional nursing care. This care is complementary to family care; the nurse is helping the caregiver - family member. Based on my analysis, it's a very gratifying fact that nurses working in this line of work provide it gladly and with loving care. The care for the elderly is based on the principle of gratefulness, love, on the principle of sharing mutual feelings and the joys of small improvements. If we manage to increase {{the quality of life of}} caregivers with an adequate help, we will also enable the elderly or ill people to lead a contended and better quality life...|$|R

When {{at the battle of}} Lowestoft (3 June 1665) the rear-admiral of the white, Robert Sansum, was killed, Holmes claimed his post (which Rupert endorsed), but James gave the flag to his own flag captain, Harman.

On 27 March 1666, the powerful new third-rate Defiance (64) was launched in the presence of Charles II, James and Rupert, Holmes having been appointed captain and being knighted on the occasion. Part of the red squadron, Holmes was finally given acting flag-rank when the fleet was divided to shadow the Dutch and simultaneously intercept the French (which put him, satisfyingly, one step above Harman, rear-admiral of the white - a slighting of the principle of seniority which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>unthinkable</b> {{at the end of the}} century). During the murderous Four Days Battle, Holmes was reported to have [...] "done wonders" [...] (CSP Dom., 7 June 1666), and was confirmed as rear-admiral of the red, his ship having received such a battering that he transferred his flag to the partially burnt and dismasted Henry (72), Harman's ship, who had been wounded. But again, his rivals Sir Jeremiah Smith (made admiral of the blue) and Sir Edward Spragge (vice-admiral of the blue) were promoted above him. These professional rivalries were a hallmark of the restoration navy, and Holmes used the conduct of the St James' Day Fight, to start a bitter quarrel with Sir Jeremiah Smith, whose rear squadron had been routed by Cornelis Tromp. The recriminations between the officers and their respective factions played a role in the subsequent Parliamentary investigation over embezzlement in the naval administration and the conduct of the war. On 9 August 1666, Holmes achieved his best-known feat, characteristically (and, to Pepys and Coventry, exasperatingly) using his own judgement in interpreting his orders. Holmes was to land five hundred men on the island of Vlieland and four hundred on Terschelling and loot and destroy as much as possible. Instead of this, Holmes executed a fireship attack on the mass of merchantmen lying in Vlie Road, destroying some 150 ships, and sacked the Mennonite town of West-Terschelling. This, Holmes's Bonfire, was the heaviest blow the English ever dealt Dutch merchant shipping, severely endangering the Netherlands' war effort, at the cost of no more than twelve English casualties.|$|E
