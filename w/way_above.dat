The Penny Arcade Reports Ben Kuchera called the game [...] "the Ouya's killer app", Polygons Russ Frushtick and Chris Plante said that TowerFall was the reason to purchase an Ouya. Destructoids Spencer Hayes said that he did not consider purchasing the Ouya until he played TowerFall. He added that the game had a [...] "deceptive level of depth". Eurogamer described its reputation as [...] "the only thing worth playing on Ouya". The added cost of additional controllers (for four-player local multiplayer) exceeded the cost of the new console itself, and was cited as a negative for the game, though later offset by its support for Xbox 360 and PS3 controllers. Plante later described the original release as [...] "critically beloved, humbly sold", [...] "punching <b>way</b> <b>above</b> its weight class" [...] with recognition on the yearend lists of Ars Technica and Polygon.|$|E
500|$|In 1980, Tideman characterised five {{different}} patterns of calls among Malurus leucopterus leuconotus; these were recognised by Pruett and Jones among the island subspecies M. l. edouardi. The main call is a reel made by both sexes {{in order to}} establish territory and unify the group. It is a long song of [...] "rising and falling notes" [...] that is first signaled by 3–5 chip notes. Although seemingly weak in sound, the reel carries a long <b>way</b> <b>above</b> the stunted shrubland. A harsh trit call is often used to establish contact (especially between mothers and their young) and to raise alarm; it is characterised by a series of [...] "loud and abrupt" [...] calls that vary in frequency and intensity. Adults will use a high-pitched peep that may be made intermittently with reels as a contact call to birds that are more distant. Nestlings, fledglings, and females around the nest will use high pips—quiet, high-pitched, and short calls. When used by a mature female, they are mixed with harsh calls. Nestlings may also make [...] "gurgling" [...] noises when they are being fed. The subordinate helpers and feeders may also make this sound.|$|E

500|$|Writers {{agree that}} the episode was risky and could have failed spectacularly. Jonathan Bernstein in the British {{newspaper}} The Observer writes [...] "What could have been, at best, an eccentric diversion and, at worst, a shuddering embarrassment, succeeded on every level It provided a startling demonstration that creator Joss Whedon has a facility with lyrics and melody equal to the one he's demonstrated {{for the past six}} seasons with dialogue, character and plot twists. Rather than adopt the 'Hey, wouldn't it be wacky if we suddenly burst into song?' approach practised by Ally McBeal, the Buffy musical was entirely organic to the series' labyrinthine progression." [...] Johnston in the Sunday Herald Sun says, [...] "There is just so much to this marvellously cheeky episode that suggests the show can take any route it pleases and pull it off", while Debi Enker in The Age comments, [...] "Whedon demonstrates yet again what Buffy aficionados have known and appreciated for years: that his wit, playfulness and readiness to take a risk make his television efforts rise <b>way</b> <b>above</b> the pack." [...] Steve Murray in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution characterizes the episode as [...] "scary in a brand-new way", saying [...] "Once More, with Feeling" [...] is [...] "as impressive as Whedon's milestone episodes 'Hush' and 'The Body; the episode is [...] "often hilarious", according to Murray, and acts as [...] "(b)oth spoof and homage, [...] the hokiness of musicals while also capturing the guilty pleasure and surges of feeling the genre inspires".|$|E
